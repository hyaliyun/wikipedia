All members of the Ruminantia employ foregut fermentation and are ruminants: they digest food in two steps, chewing and swallowing in the normal way to begin with, and then regurgitating the semidigested cud to rechew it and thus extract the maximum possible food value. Evolution Ruminantiamorpha is a total clade of artiodactyls defined, according to Spaulding et al., as \\"Ruminantia plus all extinct taxa more closely related to extant members of Ruminantia than to any other living species.\\" Spaulding grouped some genera of the family Anthracotheriidae within Ruminantiamorpha (but not in Ruminantia), but placed others within Ruminantiamorpha's sister clade, Cetancodontamorpha. The Tragulidae are the basal family in Ruminantia.

It is owned by the Naples Airport Authority. The airport is home to flight schools, air charter operators, car rental agencies, and corporate aviation and non-aviation businesses. The airport is also a central location for public services, including fire/rescue services, mosquito control, the Collier County Sheriff‚Äôs Aviation Unit and other community services. During fiscal year 2017-2018, the airport serviced more than 112,000 operations. History The facility was established in 1942 as Naples Army Airfield by the United States Army Air Forces. It was initially assigned to the Southeast Training Center (later Eastern Flying Training Command). Provided basic (level 1) flight training to flight cadets by Embry-Riddle Co; Fairchild PT-19s were the primary trainer used. Along with the flight training, was a sub-base to Buckingham Army Airfield for flexible gunnery training, which the 75th Flying Training Wing supervised. Inactivated on November 1, 1945, being turned over to the War Assets Administration for conveyance to civil control as a public airport. The Naples Airdrome was returned to the city of Naples and Collier County in 1947, after the military deemed it no longer necessary. The airport was managed by John Zate, a pilot and Naples resident.Provincetown-Boston Airlines began scheduled service to Miami International Airport in the 1950s, and managed the airport for several years until a municipal airport authority was created in 1969. The airport also historically had scheduled service to Orlando, Tampa and Key West. Traffic at the airport peaked in 1980, when more than 195,000 passengers used the airport, but fell in the mid 1980s due to the opening of the much larger Southwest Florida International Airport in nearby Fort Myers. The airport code APF derives from \\"alternate Page Field\\" - which is a reference to Page Field in Fort Myers. The airport experienced a rebound in traffic during the mid-1990s, with 173,000 passengers and seven airlines in 1995. Passenger numbers dipped when American Eagle ceased scheduled service to Miami in 2001, and dipped even further following the September 11, 2001 attacks. Scheduled airline service to Naples ended in 2003 when US Airways Express ceased service to Tampa International Airport. Atlantic Southeast Airlines operated Delta Connection flights between Naples and Atlanta from 2004 to 2007 with a revenue guarantee from the city, but ended the service after retiring its fleet of 40-seat aircraft, again leaving the airport without scheduled service. Elite Airways also offered scheduled service to the airport in October 2015, with flights to Portland (ME), New York City, and Melbourne (FL), but ended in March 2017 due to low demand and poor service. In December 2018, the airport authority changed the facility's name from Naples Municipal Airport to Naples Airport. They also changed the airport's logo to a more modern one.  Facilities and aircraft  Naples Airport covers an area of 732 acres (296 ha) at an elevation of 8 feet (2 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 5/23 measuring 6,600 by 150 feet (2,012 x 46 m) and 14/32 measuring 5,000 by 100 ft (1,524 x 30 m). It also has one turf runway designated SW/NE which measures 1,850 by 100 ft (564 x 30 m). For the 12-month period ending September 30, 2017, the airport had 95,018 aircraft operations, an average of 260 per day: % general aviation, % air taxi, % military and % airline. At that time, there were 304 aircraft based at this airport: % single-engine, % multi-engine, % jet and % helicopter. The airport has two terminals: one for passengers, and the other for General aviation. Charter airlines like ExecAir, baggage claim, boarding gates, security, and car rental agencies are located in the passenger terminal. There is also a military museum with WWII artifacts and memorabilia. The car rental agencies offered are Hertz, Avis, Enterprise, and Alamo. The general aviation is a two-story terminal used for personal flights, which also houses car rental agencies.

The Patriarchate of Antioch was established by Saint Peter in the 1st century AD, but split into two separate lines of patriarchs after the deposition of Patriarch Severus of Antioch in 518 over the issue of the Council of Chalcedon of 451. The non-Chalcedonian supporters of Severus went on to form what is now known as the Syriac Orthodox Church, whilst the Chalcedonians developed the church now known as the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch. The Syriac Orthodox Church underwent schism in the medieval era, first, after the death of Patriarch Philoxenus I Nemrud in 1292 with the formation of separate patriarchates of Mardin and Melitene, and again in 1364 due to the emergence of a patriarchate of Tur Abdin. Unity was restored to the church gradually as the patriarchate at Melitene came to an end in c. 1360, and the patriarchate of Mardin lapsed after its patriarch Ignatius Behnam Hadloyo was acknowledged as Patriarch of Antioch in 1445. A line of patriarchs in communion with the Roman Catholic Church split permanently in 1783, and thus formed the Syriac Catholic Church.

The term cholelithiasis may refer to the presence of gallstones or to any disease caused by gallstones, and choledocholithiasis refers to presence of migrated gallstones within bile ducts. Most people with gallstones (about 80%) are asymptomatic. However, when a gallstone obstructs the bile duct and causes acute cholestasis, a reflexive smooth muscle spasm often occurs, resulting in an intense cramp-like visceral pain in the right upper part of the abdomen known as a biliary colic (or \\"gallbladder attack\\"). This happens in 1‚Äì4% of those with gallstones each year. Complications of gallstones may include inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), obstructive jaundice, and infection in bile ducts (cholangitis). Symptoms of these complications may include pain of more than five hours duration, fever, yellowish skin, vomiting, dark urine, and pale stools. Risk factors for gallstones include birth control pills, pregnancy, a family history of gallstones, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, or rapid weight loss. The bile components that form gallstones include cholesterol, bile salts, and bilirubin. Gallstones formed mainly from cholesterol are termed cholesterol stones, and those mainly from bilirubin are termed pigment stones. Gallstones may be suspected based on symptoms. Diagnosis is then typically confirmed by ultrasound. Complications may be detected on blood tests. The risk of gallstones may be decreased by maintaining a healthy weight with exercise and a healthy diet. If there are no symptoms, treatment is usually not needed. In those who are having gallbladder attacks, surgery to remove the gallbladder is typically recommended. This can be carried out either through several small incisions or through a single larger incision, usually under general anesthesia. In rare cases when surgery is not possible, medication can be used to dissolve the stones or lithotripsy to break them down. In developed countries, 10‚Äì15% of adults have gallstones. Rates in many parts of Africa, however, are as low as 3%. Gallbladder and biliary related diseases occurred in about 104 million people (1.6% of people) in 2013 and they resulted in 106,000 deaths. Women more commonly have stones than men and they occur more commonly after the age of 40. Certain ethnic groups have gallstones more often than others. For example, 48% of Native Americans have gallstones. Once the gallbladder is removed, outcomes are generally good. Definitions Gallstone disease refers to the condition where gallstones are either in the gallbladder or common bile duct. The presence of stones in the gallbladder is referred to as cholelithiasis, from the Greek chol- (bile) + lith- (stone) + -iasis (process). Presence of gallstones in the common bile duct is called choledocholithiasis, from the Greek chol- (bile) + docho- (duct) + lith- (stone) + iasis- (process). Choledocholithiasis is frequently associated with obstruction of the bile ducts, which in turn can lead to cholangitis, from the Greek: chol- (bile) + ang- (vessel) + itis- (inflammation), a serious infection of the bile ducts. Gallstones within the ampulla of Vater can obstruct the exocrine system of the pancreas, which in turn can result in pancreatitis. Signs and symptoms Gallstones, regardless of size or number, may be asymptomatic, even for years. Such \\"silent stones\\" do not require treatment. A characteristic symptom of a gallstone attack is the presence of colicky pain in the upper-right side of the abdomen, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The pain steadily increases for approximately 30 minutes to several hours. A person may also experience referred pain between the shoulder blades or below the right shoulder. Often, attacks occur after a particularly fatty meal and almost always happen at night, and after drinking. In addition to pain, nausea, and vomiting, a person may experience a fever. If the stones block the duct and cause bilirubin to leak into the bloodstream and surrounding tissue, there may also be jaundice and itching. If this is the case, the liver enzymes are likely to be raised. =Other complications= Rarely, gallstones in cases of severe inflammation may erode through the gallbladder into adherent bowel potentially causing an obstruction termed gallstone ileus. Other complications include ascending cholangitis if there is a bacterial infection which can cause purulent inflammation in the biliary tree and liver, and acute pancreatitis as blockage of the bile ducts can prevent active enzymes being secreted into the bowel, instead damaging the pancreas. Rarely gallbladder cancer may occur as a complication. Risk factors Gallstone risk increases for females (especially before menopause) and for people near or above 40 years; the condition is more prevalent among both North and South Americans and people of European descent than among other ethnicities. A lack of melatonin could significantly contribute to gallbladder stones, as melatonin inhibits cholesterol secretion from the gallbladder, enhances the conversion of cholesterol to bile, and is an antioxidant, which is able to reduce oxidative stress to the gallbladder. Researchers believe that gallstones may be caused by a combination of factors, including inherited body chemistry, body weight, gallbladder motility (movement), and low-calorie diet. The absence of such risk factors does not, however, preclude the formation of gallstones. Nutritional factors that may increase risk of gallstones include constipation; eating fewer meals per day; low intake of the nutrients folate, magnesium, calcium, and vitamin C; low fluid consumption; and, at least for men, a high intake of carbohydrate, a high glycemic load, and high glycemic index diet. Wine and whole-grained bread may decrease the risk of gallstones. Rapid weight loss increases risk of gallstones. The weight loss drug orlistat is known to increase the risk of gallstones. Cholecystokinin deficiency caused by celiac disease increases risk of gallstone formation, especially when diagnosis of celiac disease is delayed. Pigment gallstones are most commonly seen in the developing world. Risk factors for pigment stones include hemolytic anemias (such as from sickle-cell disease and hereditary spherocytosis), cirrhosis, and biliary tract infections. People with erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) are at increased risk to develop gallstones. Additionally, prolonged use of proton pump inhibitors has been shown to decrease gallbladder function, potentially leading to gallstone formation. Cholesterol modifying medications can affect gallstone formation. Statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis and there is evidence that their use may decrease the risk of getting gallstones. Fibrates increase cholesterol concentration in bile and their use has been associated with an increased risk of gallstones. Bile acid malabsorption may also be a risk. Pathophysiology Cholesterol gallstones develop when bile contains too much cholesterol and not enough bile salts. Besides a high concentration of cholesterol, two other factors are important in causing gallstones. The first is how often and how well the gallbladder contracts; incomplete and infrequent emptying of the gallbladder may cause the bile to become overconcentrated and contribute to gallstone formation. This can be caused by high resistance to the flow of bile out of the gallbladder due to the complicated internal geometry of the cystic duct.Experimental investigation of the flow of bile in patient specific cystic duct models M Al-Atabi, SB Chin‚Ä¶, Journal of biomechanical engineering, 2010 The second factor is the presence of proteins in the liver and bile that either promote or inhibit cholesterol crystallization into gallstones. In addition, increased levels of the hormone estrogen, as a result of pregnancy or hormone therapy, or the use of combined (estrogen-containing) forms of hormonal contraception, may increase cholesterol levels in bile and also decrease gallbladder motility, resulting in gallstone formation. =Composition= From left to right: cholesterol stone, mixed stone, pigment stone. The composition of gallstones is affected by age, diet and ethnicity. On the basis of their composition, gallstones can be divided into the following types: cholesterol stones, pigment stones, and mixed stones. An ideal classification system is yet to be defined. Cholesterol stones Cholesterol stones vary from light yellow to dark green or brown or chalk white and are oval, usually solitary, between 2 and 3 cm long, each often having a tiny, dark, central spot. To be classified as such, they must be at least 80% cholesterol by weight (or 70%, according to the Japanese‚Äìclassification system). Between 35% and 90% of stones are cholesterol stones. Pigment stones Bilirubin (\\"pigment\\", \\"black pigment\\") stones are small, dark (often appearing black), and usually numerous. They are composed primarily of bilirubin (insoluble bilirubin pigment polymer) and calcium (calcium phosphate) salts that are found in bile. They contain less than 20% of cholesterol (or 30%, according to the Japanese-classification system). Between 2% and 30% of stones are bilirubin stones. Mixed stones Mixed (brown pigment stones) typically contain 20‚Äì80% cholesterol (or 30‚Äì70%, according to the Japanese- classification system). Other common constituents are calcium carbonate, palmitate phosphate, bilirubin and other bile pigments (calcium bilirubinate, calcium palmitate and calcium stearate). Because of their calcium content, they are often radiographically visible. They typically arise secondary to infection of the biliary tract which results in the release of Œ≤-glucuronidase (by injured hepatocytes and bacteria) which hydrolyzes bilirubin glucuronides and increases the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in bile. Between 4% and 20% of stones are mixed. Gallstones can vary in size and shape from as small as a grain of sand to as large as a golf ball.Gallstones‚ÄîCholelithiasis; Gallbladder attack; Biliary colic; Gallstone attack; Bile calculus; Biliary calculus Last reviewed: July 6, 2009.

The medication ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) appears to prevent formation of gallstones during weight loss. A high fat diet during weight loss also appears to prevent gallstones. Treatment =Surgical= Cholecystectomy (gallbladder removal) has a 99% chance of eliminating the recurrence of cholelithiasis. The lack of a gallbladder may have no negative consequences in many people. However, there is a portion of the population‚Äîbetween 10 and 15%‚Äîwho develop a condition called postcholecystectomy syndrome which may cause nausea, indigestion, diarrhea, and episodes of abdominal pain. There are two surgical options for cholecystectomy: *Open cholecystectomy is performed via an abdominal incision (laparotomy) below the lower right ribs. Recovery typically requires 3‚Äì5 days of hospitalization, with a return to normal diet a week after release and to normal activity several weeks after release. *Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, introduced in the 1980s, is performed via three to four small puncture holes for a camera and instruments. Post-operative care typically includes a same-day release or a one-night hospital stay, followed by a few days of home rest and pain medication. Obstruction of the common bile duct with gallstones can sometimes be relieved by endoscopic retrograde sphincterotomy (ERS) following endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). =Medical= Cholesterol gallstones can sometimes be dissolved with ursodeoxycholic acid taken by mouth, but it may be necessary for the person to take this medication for years. Traditional medicine Gallstones can be a valued by-product of animals butchered for meat because of their use as an antipyretic and antidote in the traditional medicine of some cultures, particularly, in traditional Chinese medicine. The most highly prized gallstones tend to be sourced from old dairy cows, termed calculus bovis or niu-huang (yellow thing of cattle) in Chinese. Some slaughterhouses carefully scrutinize workers for gallstone theft.

The dentist's supporting team aids in providing oral health services. The dental team includes dental assistants, dental hygienists, dental technicians, and sometimes dental therapists. History =Middle Ages= In China as well as France, the first people to perform dentistry were barbers. They have been categorized into 2 distinct groups: guild of barbers and lay barbers. The first group, the Guild of Barbers, was created to distinguish more educated and qualified dental surgeons from lay barbers. Guild barbers were trained to do complex surgeries. The second group, the lay barbers, were qualified to perform regular hygienic services such as shaving and tooth extraction as well as basic surgery. However, in 1400 France made decrees prohibiting lay barbers from practicing all types of surgery. In Germany as well as France from 1530 to 1575 publications completely devoted to dentistry were being published. Ambroise Par√©, often known as the Father of Surgery, published his own work about the proper maintenance and treatment of teeth. Ambroise Par√© was a French barber surgeon who performed dental care for multiple French monarchs. He is often credited with having raised the status of barber surgeons. =Modern dentistry= A man being treated by dentists Pierre Fauchard of France is often referred to as the \\"father of modern dentistry\\" for being the first to publish a scientific textbook (1728) on the techniques and practices of dentistry. Over time, trained dentists immigrated from Europe to the Americas to practice dentistry, and by 1760, America had its own native born practicing dentists. Newspapers were used at the time to advertise and promote dental services. In America from 1768‚Äì1770 the first application of dentistry to verify forensic cases was being pioneered; this was called forensic dentistry. With the rise of dentists there was also the rise of new methods to improve the quality of dentistry. These new methods included the spinning wheel to rotate a drill and chairs made specifically for dental patients. In the 1840s the world's first dental school and national dental organization were established. Along with the first dental school came the establishment of the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree, often referred to as a DDS degree. In response to the rise in new dentists as well as dentistry techniques, the first dental practice act was established to regulate dentistry. In the United States, the First Dental Practice Act required dentists to pass each specific states medical board exam in order to practice dentistry in that particular state. However, because the dental act was rarely enforced, some dentists did not obey the act. From 1846‚Äì1855 new dental techniques were being invented such as the use of ester anesthesia for surgery, and the cohesive gold foil method which enabled gold to be applied to a cavity. The American Dental Association was established in 1859 after a meeting with 26 dentists. Around 1867, the first university associated dental school was established, Harvard Dental School. Lucy Hobbs Taylor was the first woman to earn a dental degree. In the 1880s, tube toothpaste was created which replaced the original forms of powder or liquid toothpaste. New dental boards, such as the National Association of Dental Examiners, were created to establish standards and uniformity among dentists. In 1887 the first dental laboratory was established; dental laboratories are used to create dentures and crowns that are specific to each patient. In 1895 the dental X-ray was discovered by a German physicist, Wilhelm R√∂ntgen. Mary Crutchfield Thompson was one of the first Black women to graduate from Tufts University Dental School, and the first to practice dentistry in the Boston area. In the 20th century new dental techniques and technology were invented such as: the porcelain crowns (1903), Novocain (a local anesthetic) 1905, precision cast fillings (1907), nylon toothbrushes (1938), water fluoridation (1945), fluoride toothpaste (1950), air driven dental tools (1957), lasers (1960), electric toothbrushes (1960), and home tooth bleaching kits (1989) were invented. Inventions such as the air driven dental tools ushered in a new high-speed dentistry. Responsibilities A dentist in Finland treating a child By nature of their general training, a licensed dentist can carry out most dental treatments such as restorative (dental restorations, crowns, bridges), orthodontics (braces), prosthodontic (dentures, crown/bridge), endodontic (root canal) therapy, periodontal (gum) therapy, and oral surgery (extraction of teeth), as well as performing examinations, taking radiographs (x-rays) and diagnosis. Additionally, dentists can further engage in oral surgery procedures such as dental implant placement. Dentists can also prescribe medications such as antibiotics, fluorides, pain killers, local anesthetics, sedatives/hypnotics and any other medications that serve in the treatment of the various conditions that arise in the head and neck. All DDS and DMD degree holders are legally qualified to perform a number of more complex procedures such as gingival grafts, bone grafting, sinus lifts, and implants, as well as a range of more invasive oral and maxillofacial surgery procedures, though many choose to pursue residencies or other post-doctoral education to augment their abilities. A few select procedures, such as the administration of General anesthesia, legally require postdoctoral training in the US. While many oral diseases are unique and self-limiting, poor conditions in the oral cavity can lead to poor general health and vice versa; notably, there is a significant link between periodontal and cardiovascular disease. Conditions in the oral cavity may also be indicative of other systemic diseases such as osteoporosis, diabetes, AIDS, and various blood diseases, including malignancies and lymphoma. Several studies have suggested that dentists and dental students are at high risk of burnout. During burnout, dentists experience exhaustion, alienate from work and perform less efficiently. A systemic study identified risk factors associated with this condition such as practitioner's young age, personality type, gender, status of education, high job strain and / or working hours, and the burden of clinical degrees requisites. The authors of this study concluded that intervention programs at an early stage during the undergraduate level may provide practitioners with a good strategy to prepare for / cope with this condition.  Regulations  Depending on the country, all dentists are required to register with their national or local health board, regulators and a professional indemnity insurance, in order to practice dentistry. In the UK, dentists are required to register with the General Dental Council. In Australia, it is the Dental Board of Australia, while in the United States, dentists are registered according to the individual state board. The main role of a dental regulator is to protect the public by ensuring only qualified dental practitioners are registered, handle any complaints or misconduct and develop national guidelines and standard for dental practitioners to follow. List of Specialties  For many countries, after satisfactory completion of post-graduate training, dental specialists are required to join a specialist board or list, in order to use the title 'specialist'. = United States of America = In the US, dental specialties are recognized by the American Dental Association (ADA) or the American Board of Dental Specialties (ABDS) Currently, the ADA lists 10 dental specialties, whom are recognised by the National Commission on Recognition of Dental Specialties and Certifying Boards, while the ABDS recognised 4 dental specialties board.

It is a severe disease of sudden onset that spreads rapidly. Symptoms usually include red or purple skin in the affected area, severe pain, fever, and vomiting. The most commonly affected areas are the limbs and perineum. Typically, the infection enters the body through a break in the skin such as a cut or burn. Risk factors include poor immune function such as from diabetes or cancer, obesity, alcoholism, intravenous drug use, and peripheral artery disease. It is not typically spread between people. The disease is classified into four types, depending on the infecting organism. Between 55 and 80% of cases involve more than one type of bacteria. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is involved in up to a third of cases. Medical imaging is often helpful to confirm the diagnosis. Necrotizing fasciitis may be prevented with proper wound care and handwashing. It is usually treated with surgery to remove the infected tissue, and intravenous antibiotics. Often, a combination of antibiotics is used, such as penicillin G, clindamycin, vancomycin, and gentamicin. Delays in surgery are associated with a much higher risk of death. Despite high-quality treatment, the risk of death is between 25 and 35%. Necrotizing fasciitis occurs in about 0.4 people per 100,000 per year in the US, and about 1 per 100,000 in Western Europe. Both sexes are affected equally. It becomes more common among older people and is rare in children. It has been described at least since the time of Hippocrates. The term \\"necrotizing fasciitis\\" first came into use in 1952. Signs and symptoms Symptoms may include fever, swelling, and complaints of excessive pain. The initial skin changes are similar to cellulitis or abscess, thus making the diagnosis at early stages difficult. Hardening of the skin and soft tissue and swelling beyond the area of skin changes are commonly present in those with early necrotizing changes. The redness and swelling usually blend into surrounding normal tissues. The overlying skin may appear shiny and tense. Other signs which are more suggestive of necrotizing changes (but present in later stages in 7 to 44% of the cases) are: formation of bullae, bleeding into the skin which is present before skin necrosis (skin turning from red to purple and black due to thrombosis of blood vessels), presence of gas in tissues, and reduced or absent sensation over the skin (due to the necrosis of the underlying nerves). Rapid progression to shock despite antibiotic therapy is another indication of necrotizing fasciitis. Necrotizing changes affecting the groin are known as Fournier gangrene. However, those who are immunocompromised (have cancer, use corticosteroid, on radiotherapy, chemotherapy, HIV/AIDS, or prior organ or bone marrow transplantation) may not show normal symptoms. Immunocompromised persons also have twice the risk of death from necrotizing infections, so higher suspicion should be maintained in this group.

The darker red center is going black. File:Necrotizing fasciitis caused by Vibrio Vulnificus.pngNecrotizing fasciitis type III caused by vibrio vulnificus. Cause =Risk factors= More than 70% of cases are recorded in people with at least one of these clinical situations: immunosuppression, diabetes, alcoholism/drug abuse/smoking, malignancies, and chronic systemic diseases. For reasons that are unclear, it occasionally occurs in people with an apparently normal general condition. Necrotizing fasciitis can occur at any part of the body, but it is more commonly seen at the extremities, perineum, and genitals. Only a few of such cases arise from the chest and abdomen. Trauma is the usual cause of the infection, such as from intravenous drug injection, insulin injection, animal and insect bites, catheter insertion over the skin, or a fistula connecting skin to the internal body organs. Skin infections such as abscess and ulcers can also complicate necrotizing fasciitis. Spreading of infection through blood has been suggested for those with streptococcal pharyngitis. For infection of the perineum and genitals (Fournier gangrene), trauma, surgery, urinary tract infection, stones, and Bartholin gland abscess are the usual causes. The risk of developing necrotizing fasciitis from a wound can be reduced by good wound care and handwashing. =Bacteria= Types of soft-tissue necrotizing infection can be divided into four classes according to the types of bacteria infecting the soft tissue. This classification system was first described by Giuliano and his colleagues in 1977. Type I infection: This is the most common type of infection, and accounts for 70 to 80% of cases. It is caused by a mixture of bacterial types, usually in abdominal or groin areas. This type of infection is usually caused by various species of Gram-positive cocci, (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and enterococci), Gram-negative rods, (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and anaerobes, (Bacteroides and Clostridium species). Populations of those affected are typically older with medical comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, and immunodeficiency. Usually, trauma is not the cause of such infections. Previous history of abscess infection or gut perforation with bacterial translocation may be elicited. Clostridial infection accounts for 10% of type I infection. Clostridium species involved are Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium septicum, and Clostridium sordellii, which typically cause gas gangrene (also known as myonecrosis). Clostridium perfringens produces two deadly toxins: alpha-toxin and theta-toxin. Alpha-toxin causes excessive platelet aggregation which blocks blood vessels and deprives the vital organs of oxygen supply. This creates an acidic, oxygen-deficient environment for the proliferation of bacteria. When alpha-toxin is absorbed by soft tissues, it can inhibit the migration of white blood cells from blood vessels into the soft tissue, thus impairing phagocyte function. The two toxins together can cause destruction of red blood cells in blood vessels, damage to the integrity of the blood vessels, and suppression of heart function. Clostridium sordellii can also produce two major toxins: all known virulent strains produce the essential virulence factor lethal toxin (TcsL), and a number also produce haemorrhagic toxin (TcsH). TcsL and TcsH are both members of the large clostridial cytotoxin (LCC) family. The key Clostridium septicum virulence factor is a pore-forming toxin called alpha-toxin, though it is unrelated to the Clostridium perfringens alpha-toxin. Myonecrotic infections caused by these clostridial species commonly occur in injecting heroin users. Those with clostridial infections typically have severe pain at the wound site, where the wound typically drains foul-smelling blood mixed with serum (serosanguinous discharge). Shock can progress rapidly after initial injury or infection, and once the state of shock is established, the chance of dying exceeds 50%. Another bacterium associated with similar rapid disease progression is group A streptococcal infection (mostly Streptococcus pyogenes). Meanwhile, other bacterial infections require two or more days to become symptomatic. Type II infection: This infection accounts for 20 to 30% of cases, mainly involving the extremities. This mainly involves Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, alone or in combination with staphylococcal infections. Both types of bacteria can progress rapidly and manifest as toxic shock syndrome. Streptococcus species produce M protein, which acts as a superantigen, stimulating a massive systemic immune response which is not effective against the bacterial antigen, precipitating shock. Type II infection more commonly affects young, healthy adults with a history of injury. Type III infection: Vibrio vulnificus, a bacterium found in saltwater, is a rare cause of this infection, which occurs through a break in the skin. Disease progression is similar to type II but sometimes with little visible skin changes. Type IV infection: Some authors have described the type IV infection as fungal in nature. Diagnosis Necrotizing fasciitis producing gas in the soft tissues as seen on CT scan Necrotizing fasciitis as seen on ultrasound Micrograph of necrotizing fasciitis, showing necrosis (center of image) of the dense connective tissue, i.e. fascia, interposed between fat lobules (top-right and bottom-left of image), H&E; stain Early diagnosis is difficult, as the disease often looks early on like a simple superficial skin infection. While a number of laboratory and imaging modalities can raise the suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis, none can rule it out. The gold standard for diagnosis is a surgical exploration in a setting of high suspicion. When in doubt, a small incision can be made into the affected tissue, and if a finger easily separates the tissue along the fascial plane, the diagnosis is confirmed and an extensive debridement should be performed. =Medical imaging= Imaging has a limited role in the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. The time delay in performing imaging is a major concern. Plain radiography may show subcutaneous emphysema (gas in the subcutaneous tissue), which is strongly suggestive of necrotizing changes, but it is not sensitive enough to detect all the cases, because necrotizing skin infections caused by bacteria other than clostridial infections usually do not show subcutaneous emphysema. If the diagnosis is still in doubt, computed tomography (CT) scans and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are more sensitive modalities than plain radiography. However, both the CT scan and MRI are not sensitive enough to rule out necrotizing changes completely. CT scan may show fascial thickening, edema, subcutaneous gas, and abscess formation. In MRI, when fluid collection with deep fascia involvement occurs, thickening or enhancement with contrast injection, necrotizing fasciitis should be strongly suspected. Meanwhile, ultrasonography can show superficial abscess formation, but is not sensitive enough to diagnose necrotizing fasciitis. CT scan is able to detect about 80% of cases, while MRI may pick up slightly more. =Scoring system= A white blood cell count greater than 15,000 cells/mm3 and serum sodium level less than 135 mmol/l have a sensitivity of 90% in detecting the necrotizing soft tissue infection. It also has a 99% chance of ruling out necrotizing changes if the values have shown otherwise. Various scoring systems are being developed to determine the likelihood of getting necrotizing fasciitis, but a scoring system developed by Wong and colleagues in 2004 is the most commonly used. It is the laboratory risk indicator for necrotizing fasciitis (LRINEC) score, which can be used to stratify by risk those people having signs of severe cellulitis or abscess to determine the likelihood of necrotizing fasciitis being present. It uses six laboratory values: C-reactive protein, total white blood cell count, hemoglobin, sodium, creatinine, and blood glucose. A score of 6 or more indicates that necrotizing fasciitis should be seriously considered. The scoring criteria are: * CRP (mg/L) ‚â•150: 4 points * WBC count (√ó103/mm3) ** <15: 0 points ** 15‚Äì25: 1 point ** >25: 2 points * Hemoglobin (g/dl) ** >13.5: 0 points ** 11‚Äì13.5: 1 point ** <11: 2 points * Sodium (mmol/l) <135: 2 points * Creatinine (umol/l) >141: 2 points * Glucose (mmol/l) >10: 1 point However, the scoring system has not been validated. The values would be falsely positive if any other inflammatory conditions are present. Therefore, the values derived from this scoring system should be interpreted with caution. About 10% of patients with necrotizing fasciitis in the original study still had a LRINEC score <6. A validation study showed that patients with a LRINEC score ‚â•6 have a higher rate of both death and amputation. Prevention Necrotizing fasciitis can be partly prevented by good wound care and handwashing. Treatment Surgical debridement (cutting away affected tissue) is the mainstay of treatment for necrotizing fasciitis. Early medical treatment is often presumptive; thus, antibiotics should be started as soon as this condition is suspected. Tissue cultures (rather than wound swabs) are taken to determine appropriate antibiotic coverage, and antibiotics may be changed in light of results. Besides blood pressure control and hydration, support should be initiated for those with unstable vital signs and low urine output. =Surgery= Aggressive wound debridement should be performed early, usually as soon as the diagnosis of necrotizing soft tissue infection (NSTI) is made. Surgical incisions often extend beyond the areas of induration (the hardened tissue) to remove the damaged blood vessels that are responsible for the induration. However, cellulitic soft tissues are sometimes spared from debridement for later skin coverage of the wound. More than one operation may be used to remove additional necrotic tissue. In some cases when an extremity is affected by a NSTI, amputation may be the surgical treatment of choice. After the wound debridement, adequate dressings should be applied to prevent exposure of bones, tendons, and cartilage so that such structures do not dry out and to promote wound healing. For necrotizing infection of the perineal area (Fournier's gangrene), wound debridement and wound care in this area can be difficult because of the excretory products that often render this area dirty and affect the wound-healing process. Therefore, regular dressing changes with a fecal management system can help to keep the wound at the perineal area clean. Sometimes, colostomy may be necessary to divert the excretory products to keep the wound at the perineal area clean.

In the case of NSTIs, empiric antibiotics are broad- spectrum, covering gram-positive (including MRSA), gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria. While studies have compared moxifloxacin (a fluoroquinolone) and amoxicillin-clavulanate (a penicillin) and evaluated appropriate duration of treatment (varying from 7 to 21 days), no definitive conclusions on the efficacy of treatment, ideal duration of treatment, or the adverse effects could be made due to poor-quality evidence. =Add on therapy= * Hyperbaric oxygen: While human and animal studies have shown that high oxygen tension in tissues helps to reduce edema, stimulate fibroblast growth, increase the killing ability of white blood cells, inhibit bacterial toxin release, and increase antibiotic efficacy, no high-quality trials have been shown to support or refute the use of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in patients with NSTIs. * Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG): No clear difference between using IVIG and placebo has been shown in the treatment of NSTIs, and one study showed serious adverse effects with IVIG use, including acute kidney injury, allergic reactions, aseptic meningitis syndrome, haemolytic anaemia, thrombi, and transmissible agents. * AB103: One study assessed the efficacy of a new type of treatment that affects the immune response, called AB103. The study showed no difference in mortality with use of this therapy, but it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions due to low-quality evidence. * Supportive therapy: Supportive therapy, often including intravenous hydration, wound care, anticoagulants to prevent thromboembolic events, pain control, etc. should always be provided to patients when appropriate. Epidemiology Necrotizing fasciitis affects about 0.4 in every 100,000 people per year in the United States. About 1,000 cases of necrotizing fasciitis occur per year in the United States, but the rates have been increasing. This could be due to increasing awareness of this condition, leading to increased reporting, or bacterial virulence or increasing bacterial resistance against antibiotics. In some areas of the world, it is as common as one in every 100,000 people. Higher rates of necrotizing fasciitis are seen in those with obesity or diabetes, and those who are immunocompromised or alcoholic, or have peripheral artery disease. However, the disease may also occur in young, healthy adults with no underlying illnesses. NSAIDs may increase the rates of necrotizing infections due to the modification of immune response in the body, because NSAIDs inhibit the cycloxygenase-1 and cycloxygenase-2 enzymes which are important in producing thromboxane and prostaglandin E2. Prostaglandin has been responsible for fever, inflammation, and pain. The inhibition of prostaglandin E2 production reduces inflammatory response and leukocyte adhesion, and thus reduces immune response against bacterial invasion, giving rise to soft-tissue infection. History In the fifth century BC, Hippocrates described necrotizing soft tissue infection as a disease which was the complication of streptococcal infection where those affected would have \\"erysipelas all over the body while the cause was only a trivial accident. Bones, flesh, and sinew (cord, tendon, or nerve) would fall off from the body and there were many deaths\\". The first English description for necrotizing soft-tissue infection was by British surgeon Leonard Gillespie and British physicians Gilbert Blaine and Thomas Trotter in the 18th century. At that time, necrotizing soft-tissue infection was known as phagedaenic ulcer (ulceration that spreads and destroys surrounding tissue), phagedena gangrenous, gangrenous ulcer, malignant ulcer, putrid ulcer, or hospital gangrene. Later, \\"hospital gangrene\\" became more commonly used. In 1871 Confederate States Army surgeon Joseph Jones reported 2,642 cases of hospital gangrene with a mortality rate of 46%. In 1883, Dr Jean-Alfred Fournier described the necrotizing infection of the perineum and scrotum, now called Fournier gangrene. The term \\"necrotizing fasciitis\\" was first coined by Wilson in 1952. Its definition has become broader, to include not only infection of fascia, but also other soft-tissue infection. = Notable cases = * 1994 Lucien Bouchard, former premier of Qu√©bec, Canada, who was infected while leader of the federal official opposition Bloc Qu√©b√©cois party, lost a leg to the illness. * 1994 A cluster of cases occurred in Gloucestershire, in the west of England. Of five confirmed and one probable infection, two died. The cases were believed to be connected. The first two had acquired the Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria during surgery; the remaining four were community-acquired. The cases generated much newspaper coverage, with lurid headlines such as \\"Flesh Eating Bug Ate My Face\\". * 1997 Ken Kendrick, former agent and partial owner of the San Diego Padres and Arizona Diamondbacks, contracted the disease. He had seven surgeries in a little more than a week and later fully recovered.\\"Moorad's life changed by rare disease * 2004 Don Rickles, American stand-up comedian, actor, and author, known especially for his insult comedy, contracted the disease in his left leg. He had six surgeries and later recovered. The condition confined him in his later years to performing comedy from a chair. * 2004 Eric Allin Cornell, winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics, lost his left arm and shoulder to the disease.Cornell Discusses His Recovery from Necrotizing Fasciitis with Reporters * 2005 Alexandru Marin, an experimental particle physicist, professor at MIT, Boston University, and Harvard University, and researcher at CERN and JINR, died from the disease.\\"In Memoriam ‚Äì Alexandru A.

W. Johnson, British journalist and historian, contracted the disease in March after injuring his foot while swimming. His leg was amputated above the knee.R. W. Johnson \\"Diary\\", London Review of Books , 6 August 2009, p41 * 2011 Jeff Hanneman, guitarist for the thrash metal band Slayer, contracted the disease. He died of liver failure two years later, on May 2, 2013, and it was speculated that his infection was the cause of death. However, on May 9, 2013, the official cause of death was announced as alcohol-related cirrhosis. Hanneman and his family had apparently been unaware of the extent of the condition until shortly before his death. * 2011 Peter Watts, Canadian science-fiction author, contracted the disease. On his blog, Watts reported, \\"I'm told I was a few hours away from being dead...If there was ever a disease fit for a science-fiction writer, flesh-eating disease has got to be it. This...spread across my leg as fast as a Star Trek space disease in time- lapse.\\" * 2014 Daniel Gildenl√∂w, Swedish singer and songwriter for the band Pain of Salvation, spent several months in a hospital after being diagnosed with necrotizing fasciitis on his back in early 2014. After recovering, he wrote the album In the Passing Light of Day, a concept album about his experience during the hospitalization. * 2015 Edgar Savisaar, Estonian politician, had his right leg amputated.

He was also nephew to the 1st Earl of Athlone. He was the elder son of the 1st Marquess of Cambridge, formerly the Duke of Teck, and his wife, the former Lady Margaret Grosvenor. Early life Born at Grosvenor House, the home of his maternal grandfather, the 1st Duke of Westminster, he was styled His Serene Highness Prince George of Teck from birth. On his father's side, he was descended from King George III and‚Äîmorganatically‚Äîfrom the Royal House of W√ºrttemberg. In June 1917, at the request of George V, his father relinquished the titles, styles, and designations, \\"Highness\\", \\"Duke of Teck\\" and \\"of Teck\\" in the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg and the German Empire, and assumed the surname Cambridge by Royal Licence and Warrant. The former Duke of Teck was subsequently created Marquess of Cambridge, Earl of Eltham and Viscount Northallerton in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Prince George became George Cambridge and was styled Earl of Eltham as a courtesy title. He succeeded his father as 2nd Marquess of Cambridge on 24 October 1927. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in June 1927 and was promoted to Knight Grand Cross in June 1935. Education and career Prince George of Teck was educated at Eton College and then at Magdalen College, Oxford. He joined the Reserve Regiment of the 1st Life Guards during World War I and served as an aide-de-camp on the Personal Staff in 1918‚Äì1919. In the inter-war years, he served with the Territorial Army as a lieutenant in the Shropshire Yeomanry from 1921, then as captain in the 16th Battalion, London Regiment from 1929 to 1932. At the outbreak of World War II he mobilised as Captain with the Royal Army Service Corps and served in France, rising to rank of Major. In 1929, he became a director of Coutts & Company, a banking firm. This made him the second member of the British royal family (albeit, a very minor one) to pursue a career in the City of London. He remained with the firm until his retirement in 1951. Personal life On 10 April 1923, he married Dorothy Isabel Westenra Hastings (18 May 1899 Cirencester ‚Äì 1 April 1988), daughter of The Hon. Osmund William Toone Westenra Hastings, who was a younger son of the 13th Earl of Huntingdon. The couple had one child, Lady Mary Cambridge (24 September 1924 ‚Äì 13 December 1999). Lord and Lady Cambridge regularly attended major royal occasions, although they did not carry out royal duties. Lord Cambridge participated in the coronations of George V, George VI, and Elizabeth II. For many years he served as Royal Trustee of the British Museum. Lord Cambridge died on 16 April 1981 in Little Abington, and was buried in the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore. His peerages became extinct. His brother, Lord Frederick Cambridge, had died while fighting in Belgium during World War II.

He is a founding member of hip hop group Three 6 Mafia and the brother of the late rapper Lord Infamous. DJ Paul started his career in the late 1980s as a DJ and released a number of solo tapes, as well as three collaboration albums with Lord Infamous as The Serial Killaz. Juicy J was introduced and the three founded the group Three 6 Mafia, going on to achieve national success in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Their 2000 album, When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1, debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 chart and was certified platinum. Later followed by Da Unbreakables in 2003 and Most Known Unknown in 2005, both of which were commercially successful. In 2006, DJ Paul, Juicy J, Crunchy Black, and Frayser Boy won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \\"It's Hard out Here for a Pimp\\" from the film Hustle & Flow. Paul has also released three solo albums, and created soundtracks to two movies. He and the rest of Three 6 Mafia are known as the originators of the crunk style of music. Aside from music, DJ Paul has been involved in a variety of business ventures, including film production and real estate. He founded his own record label Scale-A-Ton Entertainment, co-owns the fashion wear line Dangerus / Skandulus, has a collection of BBQ seasonings and is the spokesman for a legal version of the drink Sizzurp. In 2018, he co-produced the track \\"Talk Up\\" featuring JAY-Z from Drake's fifth studio album, Scorpion.  Music career  = 1988‚Äì1992: Career beginnings = In 1988, DJ Paul started his career as a DJ in Memphis club \\"380 Beale\\". At first he wanted to focus on DJing instead of rapping. In 1989, he formed the duo The Serial Killaz, together with his brother Lord Infamous. Paul served as the producer, making beats, which Infamous would rap over. The two did not have any equipment, so they used to rent local DJ Just Born's studio with the money their father gave them. Paul would play and scratch records on his mother's record player when she was not home. They released self-recorded tapes in their neighborhood, school, and local shops. Their first tape, Portrait Of A Serial Killa, was released in 1992. The following year, the duo released another tape called Come with Me 2 Hell. DJ Paul eventually bought studio equipment, consisting of a keyboard, a turntable, and a four-track recorder. He started making mixtapes with popular songs and selling them at his high school. Later he started including songs of his affiliated rappers on the tapes as well, in order to promote them. Eventually, he began making mixtapes consisting only of original songs by himself and local artists. Paul claimed that Memphis DJs, such as himself, DJ Spanish Fly, DJ Squeeky and Juicy J created the modern format of mixtapes by including their original songs, instead of making compilations of other artists' music. DJ Paul also released a number of solo tapes called Underground Volume 1 to Volume 16. He rose to prominence as a DJ and producer on the south side of Memphis, and was introduced to fellow producer Juicy J, who was also garnering buzz on the north side of the city. Together with Lord Infamous, they formed the group The Backyard Posse. DJ Paul and Juicy J soon began producing tracks, described as \\"dark, eerie ... driven by bass-heavy beats and haunting sounds.\\" They changed their name to Triple Six Mafia, after a phrase Lord Infamous would use to refer to the group in their songs. = 1993‚Äì2005: Three 6 Mafia and debut solo album = In 1994, Triple Six Mafia were joined by Koopsta Knicca and released the underground album Smoked Out Loced Out. Later the group acquired two more members, Gangsta Boo and Crunchy Black and changed its name again to Three 6 Mafia. In 1995, they self-released their debut studio album, Mystic Stylez. Following the album's success, Three 6 Mafia signed a major label deal with Relativity Records. They also started their own label Hypnotize Minds and signed a number of local artists, such as Project Pat, MC Mack, La Chat, Frayser Boy and Lil Wyte, among others. DJ Paul and Juicy J exclusively produced the whole albums by their artists, as well as Three 6 Mafia's releases. The group achieved commercial success with their 2000 album, When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1, which debuted at number six on the Billboard 200 chart and was eventually certified platinum by RIAA. In 2002, DJ Paul released his debut solo studio album Underground Volume 16: For Da Summa. Most of the songs, originally featured on his 1994 mixtape Underground Volume 16: 4 Da Summa of '94, were remastered and some of the old featured artists were replaced with new ones from Hypnotize Minds, such as Frayser Boy and La Chat. The album peaked at number 127 at the Billboard 200. Three 6 Mafia released two more commercially successful albums: Da Unbreakables in 2003 and Most Known Unknown in 2005, both peaking in top five of Billboard 200. They also created the soundtracks of the movies Choices and its sequel Choices II: The Setup. By 2006, Paul and Juicy were the only members of the group left. = 2006‚Äì2012: Academy Award win, Scale-A-Ton and A Person of Interest = In 2006, DJ Paul, Juicy J, and Crunchy Black won an Academy Award for Best Original Song for \\"It's Hard out Here for a Pimp\\" from the film Hustle & Flow. The song, which they co-wrote with HCP member Frayser Boy, was also ranked at number 80 on VH1's \\"100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop\\". After Three 6 Mafia released their 2008 album Last 2 Walk, the group had conflicts with their label Sony about their music style, which led DJ Paul and Juicy J to pursue other ventures and their solo careers. In 2009, Paul released The Weigh In ‚Äì his first mixtape since the Volume series in the early 1990s. A few months later he followed up with his second solo album Scale-A- Ton, released under Paul's newly founded label Scale-A-Ton Entertainment. The album was received well by critics, earning a positive review and an \\"Album pick\\" by AllMusic. In 2010, Paul released his second mixtape Too Kill Again, hosted by DJ Scream and DJ Whoo Kid. The mixtape features many upcoming and new Memphis artists such as Lion Heart, Thug Therapy, Partee and Miscellaneous. DJ Paul stated the tape was a preview to his upcoming album, also titled Too Kill Again, which however was never released. Instead, in 2011, Paul made a new collaboration mixtape with rapper Ya Boy and producer Lil Lody, called Pray For Forgiveness. A few months later Paul released a retail No-DJ version with bonus songs to iTunes. In 2012, Paul announced he was working on an experimental dub-hop EP called A Person of Interest. Later he changed it into a full featured album, which was released on October 22. A Person of Interest was packed with a bonus DVD, including a self-titled short movie, music videos and behind the scenes footage. Paul released videos for a number of songs from the album, including \\"What I Look Like (W.I.L.L.)\\", \\"Wit Tha Shit\\", \\"Trap Back Jumpin\\", \\"E&J;\\" and a remix of \\"I'm Dat Raw\\" with Snow Tha Product. Paul called A Person of Interest his favorite solo album, stating that he loved the production and the \\"raw\\" sound of the album. = 2013‚Äìpresent: S.I.M., Da Mafia 6ix, The Killjoy Club, Master of Evil, etc. = In early 2013, DJ Paul focused on performing as a DJ, and created a DJ duo, called S.I.M. (Sex is Mandatory). The group created a number of live sets, as well as remixes to songs, such as Just Blaze & Baauer's \\"Higher\\". In late 2013, Paul and Lord Infamous were discussing creating a sequel to their 1993 album Come with Me 2 Hell, when the latter came with the idea to try and reunite the whole Three 6 Mafia crew. Infamous brought back Crunchy Black, Koopsta Knicca and Gangsta Boo, and the five of them reunited as \\"Da Mafia 6ix\\" with plans to release an album in 2014. On November 12, 2013, Da Mafia 6ix released their first mixtape 6ix Commandments. The tape was almost entirely produced by DJ Paul and featured Yelawolf, 8Ball & MJG, Krayzie Bone, Bizzy Bone, SpaceGhostPurrp and HCP affiliates Lil Wyte, Skinny Pimp and La Chat, among others. Juicy J and Project Pat also appeared as surprise guests on the posse song \\"Body Parts\\", being credited just as \\"& more\\" in the track listing. DJ Paul collaborated on a mixtape titled Clash Of Da Titans with fellow Memphis producer Drumma Boy that was released on October 23, 2013, and on a free EP, called Black Fall, with rapper Yellawolf, which they put out for Halloween on October 31, 2013. On November 26, 2013, DJ Paul released Volume 16: The Original Masters, a remaster of his 1994 mixtape 4 Da Summer of '94. It was revealed on the PSYR17 EP given away at the 2014 Gathering Of The Juggalos that DJ Paul plans to release his next solo album \\"Master Of Evil\\" on Psychopathic Records in 2015. He later confirmed it himself on the 28th of August on The Australia underground hip hop podcast \\"The Underground Podcast\\", as well as on the outro song to The Killjoy Club's debut album \\"Reindeer Games\\". DJ Paul has been announced to play South by Southwest showcase in Austin, Texas on March 21, 2015. On August 19, 2016 DJ Paul announced that he has signed to Yelawolf's Slumerican Records. Upon signing with Slumerican, Paul released a two album series titled YOTS: Year of the Six\\" parts 1 & 2. In 2017, he released the follow up to his album \\"Underground, Volume 16: For Da Summa\\" respectfully titled, \\"Underground, Volume 17: For Da Summa\\" through his own Scale-A-Ton imprint. On September 2, 2018, Paul announced that he had begun working on the next volume in the \\"Underground\\" series titled \\"Drackula: Vol. 18\\", which is said to be recorded in Castle Dracula in Transylvania. The project was originally scheduled to release sometime in 2018, but has since been pushed back to 2019.  Personal life  DJ Paul and Juicy J starred in MTV's 2007 reality show Adventures in Hollyhood, which showed Three 6 Mafia's move to Hollywood, California, following their Oscar win. The show also featured their personal assistants Computer and Big Triece, as well as Hypnotize Minds artists Project Pat and Lil Wyte. The series aired for eight episodes between April 5 and May 23, 2007. In 2011, DJ Paul starred in VH1's cooking show Famous Food together with seven other celebrities and eventually won first place. In an interview, Paul cleared up some controversy from the show, involving Ashley Dupre best known from the Eliot Spitzer scandal. In a 2013 interview, Paul said he is getting three hours of sleep a day due to the amount of work he has to do in the variety of business ventures he has a part in. Describing his daily schedule, he said that he works with all of his companies during the day and records music during the night, stating that \\"I feel like if I'm not working, then I'm losing and I'm not really giving my life what I should be giving.\\" On December 20, 2013, his brother, Lord Infamous, died from a heart attack at his mother's house in Memphis, Tennessee. DJ Paul is no longer engaged to Majda Baltic. They participated in an episode of Celebrity Wife Swap together with Plaxico Burress and his wife. They stated that they met at the Salt Lake City Airport. = Business ventures = In 2001, DJ Paul and the rest of Three 6 Mafia created the straight-to- video film Choices, followed by a sequel Choices II: The Setup, which was released in 2005. In 2007, DJ Paul and Juicy J started their own fashion wear line titled \\"Dangerus / Skandulus\\". It was branded as the official Three 6 Mafia wear and includes T-shirts, hats, accessories and stickers. DJ Paul founded his own record label Scale-A-Ton Entertainment in 2009. He has released his last two albums under the label. In 2012, DJ Paul launched a collection of BBQ seasonings called \\"DJ Paul BBQ\\". Paul initially created a BBQ rub seasoning, soon followed by a Smoked Out BBQ Sauce. In 2013, DJ Paul became the official spokesman for a new legal version of the alcoholic drink Sizzurp. As of 2013, Paul also owns a real estate company. = Legal issues = In an interview with Power 105.1's The Breakfast Club, Paul stated he has been arrested numerous times. He was sent to jail for the first time at the age of 17. In 2006, a man from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, named Ramone Williams, filed a lawsuit against DJ Paul and other Three 6 Mafia members, claiming he has been severely beaten at a Three 6 Mafia concert when other fans followed the lyrics of the song \\"Let's Start a Riot\\" and attacked him. The man claimed he was hit with a chair, kicked and stomped numerous times. Three 6 Mafia asked for dismissal of the suit on a summary judgment motion. In October 2006, both sides settled the suit and Williams received financial compensation. On June 8, 2012, a lawsuit was filed against DJ Paul and Juicy J for failing to appear in a concert which they were booked for. The suit claimed the two were booked for an April 2011 show in Orlando, Florida but never showed up. They also never returned a $9,000 advance payment they received for the performance. Paul and Juicy are demanded to pay $50,000 for economic loss, out-of-pocket expenses and loss of income and revenue. In October 2012, few days before his third album was released, DJ Paul was arrested in New York when a Taser stun gun was found on him during a routine search. He was charged with misdemeanor and released shortly after. Paul commented on the arrest: \\"I honestly didn't know it was illegal. I thought it was at the same level as pepper spray.\\" Paul pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 21 hours of community service.

This is a generalization of a Riemannian manifold in which the requirement of positive-definiteness is relaxed. Every tangent space of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold is a pseudo- Euclidean vector space. A special case used in general relativity is a four- dimensional Lorentzian manifold for modeling spacetime, where tangent vectors can be classified as timelike, null, and spacelike.  Introduction  = Manifolds = In differential geometry, a differentiable manifold is a space which is locally similar to a Euclidean space. In an n-dimensional Euclidean space any point can be specified by n real numbers. These are called the coordinates of the point. An n-dimensional differentiable manifold is a generalisation of n-dimensional Euclidean space. In a manifold it may only be possible to define coordinates locally. This is achieved by defining coordinate patches: subsets of the manifold which can be mapped into n-dimensional Euclidean space. See Manifold, Differentiable manifold, Coordinate patch for more details. = Tangent spaces and metric tensors = Associated with each point p in an n-dimensional differentiable manifold M is a tangent space (denoted T_pM). This is an n-dimensional vector space whose elements can be thought of as equivalence classes of curves passing through the point p. A metric tensor is a non-degenerate, smooth, symmetric, bilinear map that assigns a real number to pairs of tangent vectors at each tangent space of the manifold. Denoting the metric tensor by g we can express this as :g : T_pM \\\\times T_pM \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}. The map is symmetric and bilinear so if X,Y,Z \\\\in T_pM are tangent vectors at a point p to the manifold M then we have * \\\\,g(X,Y) = g(Y,X) * \\\\,g(aX + Y, Z) = a g(X,Z) + g(Y,Z) for any real number a\\\\in\\\\mathbb{R}. That g is non-degenerate means there are no non-zero X \\\\in T_pM such that \\\\,g(X,Y) = 0 for all Y \\\\in T_pM. = Metric signatures = Given a metric tensor g on an n-dimensional real manifold, the quadratic form associated with the metric tensor applied to each vector of any orthogonal basis produces n real values. By Sylvester's law of inertia, the number of each positive, negative and zero values produced in this manner are invariants of the metric tensor, independent of the choice of orthogonal basis. The signature of the metric tensor gives these numbers, shown in the same order. A non-degenerate metric tensor has and the signature may be denoted (p, q), where .  Definition  A pseudo-Riemannian manifold (M,g) is a differentiable manifold M equipped with an everywhere non-degenerate, smooth, symmetric metric tensor g. Such a metric is called a pseudo-Riemannian metric. Applied to a vector field, the resulting scalar field value at any point of the manifold can be positive, negative or zero. The signature of a pseudo- Riemannian metric is , where both p and q are non-negative. The non-degeneracy condition together with continuity implies that p and q remain unchanged throughout the manifold. Lorentzian manifold A Lorentzian manifold is an important special case of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold in which the signature of the metric is (equivalently, ; see Sign convention). Such metrics are called Lorentzian metrics. They are named after the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz. = Applications in physics = After Riemannian manifolds, Lorentzian manifolds form the most important subclass of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. They are important in applications of general relativity. A principal premise of general relativity is that spacetime can be modeled as a 4-dimensional Lorentzian manifold of signature or, equivalently, . Unlike Riemannian manifolds with positive-definite metrics, an indefinite signature allows tangent vectors to be classified into timelike, null or spacelike. With a signature of or , the manifold is also locally (and possibly globally) time- orientable (see Causal structure). Properties of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds Just as Euclidean space \\\\mathbb{R}^n can be thought of as the model Riemannian manifold, Minkowski space \\\\mathbb{R}^{n-1,1} with the flat Minkowski metric is the model Lorentzian manifold. Likewise, the model space for a pseudo-Riemannian manifold of signature (p, q) is \\\\mathbb{R}^{p,q} with the metric :g = dx_1^2 + \\\\cdots + dx_p^2 - dx_{p+1}^2 - \\\\cdots - dx_{p+q}^2 Some basic theorems of Riemannian geometry can be generalized to the pseudo- Riemannian case. In particular, the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry is true of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds as well. This allows one to speak of the Levi-Civita connection on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold along with the associated curvature tensor. On the other hand, there are many theorems in Riemannian geometry which do not hold in the generalized case. For example, it is not true that every smooth manifold admits a pseudo-Riemannian metric of a given signature; there are certain topological obstructions. Furthermore, a submanifold does not always inherit the structure of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold; for example, the metric tensor becomes zero on any light-like curve. The Clifton‚ÄìPohl torus provides an example of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold that is compact but not complete, a combination of properties that the Hopf‚ÄìRinow theorem disallows for Riemannian manifolds., p. 193.

In 1950, Gardner published the short story \\"The Case of the Suspect Sweethearts\\" under the pseudonym Della Street. Description =Original Novels= A character named Della Street first appeared in Gardner's unpublished novel Reasonable Doubt, where she was a secretary, but not the secretary of the lawyer, Ed Stark. Gardner described her this way: \\"Della Street ‚Ä¶ Secretary, twenty-seven, quiet, fast as hell on her feet, had been places. Worked in a carnival or side show, knows all the lines, hard-boiled exterior, quietly efficient, puzzled over the lawyer, chestnut hair, trim figure, some lines on her face, a hint of weariness at the corners of her eyes.\\" When Gardner submitted Reasonable Doubt to William Morrow, an editor suggested that \\"Della Street is a better character than the secretary.\\" Gardner took this suggestion when he rewrote Reasonable Doubt as The Case of the Velvet Claws and made Della Street Perry Mason's secretary. In the published novel, the carnival or side show was jettisoned, and Street came from a more \\"respectable\\" background. This is a good example of the difference between the pulp writing and slick writing of the 1930s. In the first Perry Mason novel, The Case of the Velvet Claws, written in the early days of the Great Depression, Della Street is revealed to have come from a wealthy, or at least well-to-do, family that was wiped out by the stock market crash of 1929. Della was forced to get a job as a secretary. By the time of the TV series in the 1950s and 1960s, this would not have fitted well with the age of the characters as then portrayed. According to The Case of The Caretaker's Cat, she is about 15 years younger than Perry Mason. Several instances of sexual tension are seen between Mason and Street in the Gardner novels, multiple glances, kisses, and so on, and several proposals of marriage, all of which Della turned down because, at the time, wives of professional men did not work. Thus, she could not have continued as his secretary (and effective partner) and she did not want to give up this aspect of her life. =Adaptations= Gardner was disappointed by the initial set of movies. One such change was how Street ended up married to Mason.https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/arts/television/perry-mason- history.html In the 2020 HBO adaptation, Della Street is a lesbian,https://www.standard.co.uk/stayingin/tvfilm/perry-mason-sky-atlantic- review-a4476181.html living with her girlfriend, forced to hide her sexuality.https://www.laineygossip.com/hbos-perry-mason-cant-escape-black- hole-of-white-savior-complex/66627 Origin Erle Stanley Gardner, the creator of Perry Mason in a series of novels, was a very prolific author, who simultaneously employed three secretaries‚Äîall sisters‚Äîto keep up with his output. One of them he eventually married, after his first wife‚Äîfrom whom he was separated for 30 years‚Äîdied. This was Jean Gardner, born Agnes Helene Walter. People who knew her believed she was the inspiration for Della Street, though neither she nor Gardner himself admitted it. Mrs. Gardner said she thought he put several women together to create the character. Portrayals Genevieve Tobin (left) as Della Street, with Warren William and Patricia Ellis in The Case of the Lucky Legs (1935) In the film adaptations made in the 1930s, Della Street was portrayed by five different actresses: Helen Trenholme, Claire Dodd, Genevieve Tobin, June Travis, and Ann Dvorak. Gertrude Warner was the first actress to portray Street regularly, albeit on the radio series, followed by Joan Alexander and Palmolive's \\"Madge\\", Jan Miner. The character portrayed in the radio series was reworked into Sara Lane on the daytime show Edge of Night, which was to be the daytime Perry Mason, until Gardner pulled his support for the project. On television, Della Street was played by Barbara Hale in the series, for which she received an Emmy Award, and in the 30 made-for-TV movies. Sharon Acker played Della Street in the short-lived revival series The New Perry Mason, starring Monte Markham as Mason. In the current Perry Mason for HBO, Della Street is portrayed by British actress Juliet Rylance.

It is a political and artistic project that is part of the No Border Network and the Platform for a World Without Racism. It creates critical performance theatre that targets racism, borders, migration control, biometric data collection, and other forms of social control. Since May 2001, the Publixtheatre Caravan has been creating international travelling informational, media, and artistic campaigns, to squat reality by directly interposing theater and artistic installations into everyday life. The Volxtheater Favoriten is based out of the Ernst Kirchweger Haus (EKH), the former headquarters of the Austrian Communist Party in Vienna, a legalised squat that hosts migrants and refugees, community activities, and political groups. The Volxtheater has no permanent cast. There are no directors; the plays are developed communally during long discussions, with great disparity of views.  Projects  The first production was a version of Bertolt Brecht's \\"The Threepenny Opera\\" (autumn 1994 and September 1995), followed by the Greek play \\"Penthesilea\\" (March 1996), \\"We can't pay? We won't pay\\" (June-November 1996, \\"Chor der Werkst√§tigen und Nichtwerkst√§tigen\\" (Choir of the Working and the Not Working) (Winter 1996), \\"EKHberet\\" (January 1997) \\"Theatercollagen\\" (Theatre Collages) (March 28 and 29 1997), \\"Der Auftrag\\" (The Commission) (May/June and October 1997) and \\"Schluss mit Lustig\\" (No More Joking) (December 1999). \\"Schluss mit Lustig\\" was developed in reaction to the rise to power of Austria's extreme right-wing Freedom Party, and premiered in the Vienna Schauspielhaus. Since November 2002, the Caravan has been producing full-length video and musical performance play based on the book, \\"Bukaka Spat Here,\\" by Alexander Brener and Barbara Schurz. In addition to full-length plays, the Volxtheater sees itself as an actionist group provoking political responsibility and moral courage by artistically intervening - spontaneously or planned - in public space, via street theatre and \\"guerrilla fun\\". A few of the street theatre actions of the Volxtheater include: crossing the Danube channel (spring 1995), army parade (October 26, 1995), matamorphile hexaphonium (spring 1996), demonstration against the government's cuts on social payment (April 1996), street theatre during trials against people who signed an appeal to refuse to obey orders in the army (fete of Bewegung Rotes Wien in June 1996) Krems: performance of the play \\"We can't pay? We won't pay!\\" on the street (July 1996), \\"Auf zur gro√üen Grenzschutzaktion\\" (Let's Go for the Big Frontier Protection Action) (April 26, 1997). \\"Spendenaufruf f√ºr die europ√§ische Sicherheit\\" (Call for Charity for European Safety) on the army parade (October 26, 1999). In summer 2000 the idea emerged to form a caravan to advance the political actionism of the Publix Theatre. As a part of the \\"cultural caravan through Carinthia and Styria\\", that held cultural events in villages and small towns in Carinthia and Styria and international resistance days in Klagenfurt, the caravan moved through Austria. The aim was to combine theatrical actions and information campaigns to enact change. The caravan left monuments with the inscription \\"no border no nation - for an open carinthia, for an open Europe\\" in its wake. The Publixtheatre caravans of 2001, 2002 and 2003 took this idea to an international level. Creating public theatrical interventions while dressed as UNO soldiers, police, border guards, and biometric researchers, the Publixtheatre has always provoked confusion as to whether they represent fiction or reality.  Genoa Group of Eight Summit protest  After its participation in protests during the G8 summit in Genoa, 2001, the caravan was arrested in Italy. The 25 activists, journalists, and hitchhikers who were arrested there were kept in the custody of local police and then spent the next 3‚Äì4 weeks in the Voghera and Alessandria prisons in Italy before being deported and banned from re-entry. They were accused of being members of a \\"criminal organisation\\" that Italian authorities gave the name of the \\"black bloc\\" whose imputed goal was said to be \\"devastation and looting\\". They were charged with property destruction, looting, and criminal association. The police evidence against them included their possession of black clothing, knives used to create a mobile street kitchen, as well as juggling clubs, poi, and other props.

With a population of 228,832 in 2011, it is the second largest city in the state and the largest in the district. The city is situated on the right bank of the Ganga river, at the foothills of the Shivalik ranges. Haridwar is regarded as a holy place for Hindus, hosting important religious events and serving as a gateway to several prominent places of worship. Most significant of the events is the Kumbha Mela, which is celebrated every 12 years in Haridwar. During the Haridwar Kumbh Mela, millions of pilgrims, devotees, and tourists congregate in Haridwar to perform ritualistic bathing on the banks of the river Ganges to wash away their sins to attain Moksha. According to the Samudra manthan, Haridwar along with Ujjain, Nashik and Prayagraj (Allahabad) is one of four sites where drops of Amrit, the elixir of immortality, accidentally spilled over from the pitcher while being carried by the celestial bird Garuda. Brahma Kund, the spot where the Amrit fell, is located at Har ki Pauri (literally, \\"footsteps of the Lord\\") and is considered to be the most sacred ghat of Haridwar. It is also the primary centre of the Kanwar pilgrimage, in which millions of participants gather sacred water from the Ganga and carry it across hundreds of miles to dispense as offerings in ≈öiva shrines. Today, the city is developing beyond its religious importance, with the fast developing industrial estate of State Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand (SIDCUL), and the close by township of Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited as well as its affiliated ancillaries. Haridwar presents a kaleidoscope of Indian culture and development. In the sacred writings, it has been differently specified as Kapilsthan, Gangadwar, and Mayapuri. It is additionally a passage for the Chota Char Dham (the four principal pilgrim destinations in Uttarakhand viz, Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri, and Yamunotri), subsequently, Shaivaites (adherents of Lord Shiva) and Vaishnavites (devotees of Lord Vishnu) call this place Hardwar and Haridwar individually, relating to Har being Shiv and Hari being Vishnu. Etymology Meandering main Ganga river, known here as Neel Dhara (left) and the Ganga canal (right), passing through Haridwar. The modern name of the town has two spellings: Haridwar and Hardwar. Each of these names has its own connotation. In Sanskrit, the liturgical language of Hinduism, Hari means \\"Lord Vishnu\\", while dwar means \\"gateway\\". So, Haridwar translates to \\"The Gateway to Lord Vishnu\\". It earns this name because it is typically the place where pilgrim's start their journey to visit a prominent temple of Lord Vishnu - Badrinath. Similarly, Hara could also mean \\"Lord Shiva\\".About Haridwar sahajaharidwar. Hence, Hardwar could stand for \\"Gateway to Lord Shiva\\". Hardwar is also a typical place to start a pilgrim's journey in order to reach Mount Kailash, Kedarnath, the northernmost Jyotirlinga and one of the sites of the smaller Char Dham pilgrimage circuit - all important places for worship for Hindus. According to legend, it was in Haridwar that Goddess Ganga descended when Lord Shiva released the mighty river from the locks of his hair. The River Ganga, after flowing for from its source at Gaumukh at the edge of the Gangotri Glacier, enters the Gangetic Plain for the first time at Haridwar, which gave the city its ancient name, Gangadw√°ra.

Sage Kapila is said to have an ashram here giving it, its ancient name, Kapila or Kapilasthana. The legendary King, Bhagiratha, the great-grandson of the Suryavanshi King Sagar (an ancestor of Rama), is said to have brought the river Ganges down from heaven, through years of penance in Satya Yuga, for the salvation of 60,000 of his ancestors from the curse of the saint Kapila, a tradition continued by thousands of devout Hindus, who bring the ashes of their departed family members, in hope of their salvation. Lord Vishnu is said to have left his footprint on the stone that is set in the upper wall of Har Ki Pauri, where the Holy Ganges touches it at all times. Haridwar came under the rule of the Maurya Empire (322‚Äì185 BCE), and later under the Kushan Empire (c. 1st‚Äì3rd centuries). Archaeological findings have proved that terra cotta culture dating between 1700 BCE and 1200 BCE existed in this region.Haridwar History Haridwar Official website.

It is said that Raja Man Singh of Amber, laid that foundation of the present-day city of Haridwar and also renovated the ghats at Har Ki Pauri. After his death, his ashes are also said to have been immersed at Brahma Kund. Thomas Coryat, an English traveller, who visited the city in the reign of Emperor Jahangir (1596‚Äì1627) mentions it as 'Haridwara', the capital of Shiva. Being one of the oldest living cities, Haridwar finds its mention in the ancient Hindu scriptures as it weaves through the life and time stretching from the period of the Buddha, to the more recent British advent. Haridwar has a rich and ancient religious and cultural heritage. It still has many old havelis and mansions bearing exquisite murals and intricate stonework. One of the two major dams on the river Ganges, the Bhimgoda, is situated here. Built-in the 1840s, it diverts the waters of the Ganges to the Upper Ganges Canal, which irrigated the surrounding lands. Though this caused severe deterioration to the Ganges water flow, and is a major cause for the decay of the Ganges as an inland waterway, which till the 18th century was used heavily by the ships of the East India Company, and a town as high up as Tehri, was considered a port city The headworks of the Ganges Canal system is located in Haridwar. The Upper Ganges Canal was opened in 1854 after the work began in April 1842,Upper Ganges Canal The Imperial Gazetteer of India, 1909, v. 12, p. 138. prompted by the famine of 1837‚Äì38. The unique feature of the canal is the half-kilometre- long aqueduct over the Solani river at Roorkee, which raises the canal 25 metres above the original river. United Province, 1903 'Haridwar Union Municipality' was constituted in 1868, which included the then villages of Mayapur and Kankhal. Haridwar was first connected with railways, via Laksar, through branch line in 1886, when the Awadh and Rohilakhand Railway line was extended through Roorkee to Saharanpur, this was later extended to Dehradun in 1900.Trade and Communications The Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 21, p. 375.

Haridwar has been an abode of the weary in body, mind, and spirit. It has also been a centre of attraction for learning various arts, science, and culture. The city has a long-standing position as a great source of Ayurvedic medicines and herbal remedies and is home to the unique Gurukul (school of traditional education), including the Gurukul Kangri Vishwavidyalaya, which has a vast campus, and has been providing traditional education of its own kind, since 1902. Development of Haridwar took an upturn in the 1960s, with the setting up of a temple of modern civilisation, BHEL, a 'Maharatna PSU' in 1975, which brought along not just a its own township of BHEL, Ranipur, close to the existing Ranipur village, but also a set of ancillaries in the region.

Cityscape Panoramic view of Har ki Pauri Mansa Devi Temple Hindu genealogy registers at Haridwar Main bathing Ghat, at Haridwar, in the 1880s. Something that is not well known today to Indians and to those settled abroad, in an ancient custom detailed family genealogies of Hindu families for the past several generations are kept by professional Hindu Brahmins popularly known as Pandas, at the Hindu holy city of Haridwar in handwritten registers passed down to them over generations by their Brahmin ancestors which are classified according to original districts and villages of one's ancestors, with special designated Brahmin families being in charge of designated district registers, even for cases where ancestral districts and villages that have been left behind in Pakistan after Partition of India with Hindus having to migrate to India. In several cases present-day descendants are now Sikhs and many maybe Muslims or even Christians. It is common for one to find details of up to, or even more than, ones seven past generations in these genealogy registers kept by the Pandas of Haridwar. For centuries when Hindu ancestors visited the holy town of Haridwar for any purpose which may have mostly been for pilgrimage purposes or/and for cremation of their dead or for immersion of ashes and bones of their kin after cremation into the waters of the holy river the Ganges as required by Hindu religious custom, it has been an ancient custom to go to the Pandit who is in charge of one's family register and update the family's genealogical family tree with details of all marriages, births, and deaths from ones extended joint family. In present-day India, people visiting Haridwar are dumbfounded when Pandas out of the blue solicit them to come and update their very own ancestral genealogical family tree. News travels like wildfire among the Pandas with ones family's designated Panda being quickly notified of ones visit. Nowadays with Hindu joint family system had broken down with people preferring more nuclear families, record-keeping Pandits prefer visitors to Haridwar to come prepared after getting in touch with all of the one's extended family and bringing all relevant details regarding one's ancestral district and village, names of grandparents and great grandparents and marriages, births and deaths that have occurred in the extended family, even with as many details as possible of the families married into. A visiting family member is required to personally sign the family genealogical register furnished by ones Family Panda after updating it for future family visitors and generations to see and to authenticate the updated entries. Friends and other family members accompanying on the visit may also be requested to sign as witnesses. However, it is preferable to visit one's family pandas before immersion of ashes of one's kin as they will help properly in these rituals.

The drug testing policy dealt with the perception that the NBA had a drug problem, which it admitted, and it was cleaning it up. The NBA was the first of the major sports leagues in North America to implement a drug testing policy. The salary cap created a revenue-sharing system where owner and player were effectively partners, with players receiving 53 percent of all revenues. Both of these agreements solidified Stern's standing inside NBA circles. =NBA Commissioner= On February 1, 1984, Stern became the Commissioner of the NBA, succeeding O'Brien during the league's recovery from its darkest period. Instead of marketing the league's teams, he changed the focus to its star players, such as Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, and Michael Jordan and Charles Barkley from the 1984 NBA draft, which was held soon after Stern took office. Jordan's arrival, in particular, ushered in a new era of commercial bounty for the NBA. With him came his flair and talent for the game, and that brought in shoe contracts from Nike which helped to give the league even more national attention. Stern guided the league through dwindling viewership en route to global growth.David Stern's legacy is that of a giant In his first year as commissioner, Stern offered Adrian Paenza, a South American basketball and soccer analyst, and the Argentina Channel 9 the rights to air weekly NBA highlights for $2,000 a year. In 1987, he started the shipping of VHS tapes from his New York office to China‚Äôs state-run television station to expand the league's reach beyond North America.Saying goodbye to Stern: A phone call I‚Äôll never forget, and the plane ride that will never be Stern pushed to allow professionals to participate in the Olympics, helping spawn the 1992 U.S. Olympic team of NBA players, dubbed the \\"Dream Team\\", which begat the first wave of international NBA stars. One of the Dream Team members was Johnson. A year earlier, he announced that he was HIV-positive and retiring from basketball in a press conference with Stern sitting by his side. At the time, the public was afraid of HIV and the disease was demonized. Some people feared it could be transmitted by sweat or a handshake. Despite backlash, Stern allowed Johnson to play in the 1992 NBA All-Star Game and later for the Dream Team. Having read medical literature and consulted experts, Stern helped inform league owners, players, sponsors and the public about the virus. The NBA put infection-control procedures in place; previously, players were allowed to play while bleeding. In 1995, the NBA expanded into Canada, introducing the Toronto Raptors and the Vancouver Grizzlies to the league. During Stern's tenure, a total of seven new franchises (the Hornets, Timberwolves, Heat, Magic, Grizzlies, Raptors, and Bobcats) were admitted to the NBA, bringing the number of teams in the league to 30 by 2004. In 2000, it was revealed that the Minnesota Timberwolves had tampered with Joe Smith two years earlier by promising him a more lucrative contract in future years in exchange for signing him below market value so they could sign more players in the short-term. The NBA voided the last year of Smith's contract, fined the franchise $3.5 million and took away the Timberwolves' next three 1st-round NBA Draft picks. Although many believed that tampering is a common practice, Stern abided by arbitrator Kenneth Dam's ruling that the Timberwolves had signed the secret agreement, and denied that the league was making an example of the Timberwolves. Before the 2005‚Äì06 season, the NBA announced a new dress code, which banned players from wearing headphones, chains, shorts, sleeveless shirts, indoor sunglasses, T-shirts, jerseys and headgear such as baseball caps during NBA-related public appearances. Allen Iverson criticized the policy: \\"They're targeting guys who dress like me, guys who dress hip-hop ... I think they went way overboard.\\" A decade later, Stern's edict was credited with spawning a style trend among NBA stars toward high fashion. Stern advocated a minimum age limit for NBA players. Starting with the 2006 NBA draft, players could no longer be selected straight out of high school and needed to be at least 19 years old, creating the one-and-done rule. In 2001, Stern had stated, \\"If these kids have the ability to get a little more maturity, a little more coaching, a little bit more life experience overall, that's good.\\" He was criticized for his reference to the 18-year-old adults, most of whom were African American, as \\"these kids\\", when other professional sports and occupations allowed 18-year olds. For the 2006‚Äì07 season the NBA introduced a new \\"microfiber\\" basketball for use in NBA games, replacing the previous style ball used since 1970. Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban agreed with the need for a new ball, claiming the old style ball was inconsistent. Many of the league's most prominent players openly expressed their dislike for the new ball, such as Shaquille O'Neal who said, \\"Feels like one of those cheap balls that you buy at the toy store.\\" A study, financed by Cuban, claimed that the new ball \\"bounces 5 to 8% lower than typical leather balls when dropped from 4 feet...[and] the new ball bounces 30% more erratically.\\" However, Stern initially refused to go back to the original ball despite many complaints by players about the new ball. Two months into the season, the National Basketball Players Association filed a grievance related to the quality of the ball and the cuts it had caused on players' fingers. Stern acknowledged that the NBA \\"could have done a better job\\" with the decision and implementation, and that it would have been better to get the players' input in advance. On December 11, 2006 the NBA announced that it would in fact switch back to the leather ball starting on January 1, 2007.Roscoe, nance. \\"NBA to ditch new ball, return to old\\", USA Today, December 11, 2006. Retrieved September 3, 2007. In 2007, Stern injected himself in the controversy surrounding the purchase and subsequent relocation of the Seattle SuperSonics by Oklahoman Clay Bennett and his ownership group. His support for the surprising move from the nation's 14th-largest market to the 45th was questioned by many both in the public and media. Stern's tenure saw the relocation of 6 NBA franchises. In the summer of 2011, the NBA lockout cost the league regular-season games for the second time in league history; the first occurred during the 1998‚Äì99 lockout. Those were the only times the league has lost games as a result of work stoppages. Stern was known as a relentless negotiator. During the 2011 lockout, he was accused by HBO commentator Bryant Gumbel of being \\"some kind of modern-day plantation overseer\\", a reference to the division between the NBA's primarily white owners and its predominantly black players. On December 8, 2011, Stern vetoed a three-team trade that would have sent Chris Paul to the Lakers, Lamar Odom to the league-owned Hornets, and Pau Gasol to the Rockets for what a spokesman would only say were \\"basketball reasons\\". Early reactions from around the league, fanbase, and media were all largely negative, with players taking to Twitter to express their concerns, and several noted sports journalists criticizing the decision. The deal was maligned especially because of the conflict of interest posed by the league's ownership of one of its teams. On October 25, 2012, Stern announced that he would step down as NBA commissioner on February 1, 2014, after 30 years in the role, longer than each of his three predecessors. He was succeeded by his deputy Adam Silver, but remained affiliated with the league with the title of commissioner emeritus. Stern received the Olympic Order in 2012. In 2014, Stern was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. In 2016, he became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame. Personal life and death Stern in 2012 Stern was married to Dianne Bock Stern, and they had two sons: Eric and Andrew. They resided in Scarsdale, New York. By the later years of his commissionership, Stern was earning a $9 million salary. He stood at .NBA commissioner David Stern towered over the league he built On December 12, 2019, Stern suffered a brain hemorrhage and underwent emergency surgery. He died in Manhattan on January 1, 2020, at age 77. In remembrance of Stern, all NBA teams wore black bands on their jerseys for the remainder of the 2019‚Äì20 season.

It is a pale-yellow solid that is readily soluble in most organic solvents. Oxybenzone belongs to the class of aromatic ketones known as benzophenones. It is a naturally occurring chemical found in various flowering plants as well as being an organic component of many sunscreen lotions. It is also in widespread use in things like plastics, toys, furniture finishes, and more to limit UV degradation.  Structure and electronic structure  Being a conjugated molecule, oxybenzone absorbs light at lower energies than many aromatic molecules. As in related compounds, the hydroxyl group is hydrogen bonded to the ketone. This interaction contributes to oxybenzone's light-absorption properties. At low temperatures, however, it is possible to observe both the phosphorescence and the triplet-triplet absorption spectrum. At 175 K the triplet lifetime is 24 ns. The short lifetime has been attributed to a fast intramolecular hydrogen transfer between the oxygen of the C=O and the OH.  Production  Oxybenzone is produced by Friedel-Crafts reaction of benzoyl chloride with 3-methoxyphenol. Synthesis of oxybenzone by Friedel-Crafts reaction  Uses  Oxybenzone is used in plastics as an ultraviolet light absorber and stabilizer. It is used, along with other benzophenones, in sunscreens, hair sprays, and cosmetics because they help prevent potential damage from sunlight exposure. It is also found, in concentrations up to 1%, in nail polishes. Oxybenzone can also be used as a photostabilizer for synthetic resins. Benzophenones can leach from food packaging, and are widely used as photo- initiators to activate a chemical that dries ink faster. As a sunscreen, it provides broad-spectrum ultraviolet coverage, including UVB and short-wave UVA rays. As a photoprotective agent, it has an absorption profile spanning from 270 to 350 nm with absorption peaks at 288 and 350 nm. It is one of the most widely used organic UVA filters in sunscreens today. It is also found in nail polish, fragrances, hairspray, and cosmetics as a photostabilizer. Despite its photoprotective qualities, much controversy surrounds oxybenzone because of its possible hormonal and photoallergenic effects, leading many countries to regulate its use.  Safety  Some debate focuses on the potential of oxybenzone as a contact allergen with a 2001 study finding contact dermatitis \\"uncommon\\" for oxybenzone. Due to the advent of PABA-free sunscreens, oxybenzone is now the most common allergen found in sunscreens. = In vivo studies = The incidence of oxybenzone causing photoallergy is extremely uncommon, however, oxybenzone has been associated with rare allergic reactions triggered by sun exposure. In a study of 82 patients with photoallergic contact dermatitis, just over one quarter showed photoallergic reactions to oxybenzone. In a 2008 study of participants ages 6 and up, oxybenzone was detected in 96.8% of urine samples. Humans can absorb anywhere from 0.4% to 8.7% of oxybenzone after one topical application of sunscreen, as measured in urine excretions. This number can increase after multiple applications over the same period of time. Oxybenzone is particularly penetrative because it is the most lipophilic of the three most common UV filters. When applied topically, UV filters, such as oxybenzone, are absorbed through the skin, metabolized, and excreted primarily through the urine. The method of biotransformation, the process by which a foreign compound is chemically transformed to form a metabolite, was determined by Okereke and colleagues through oral and dermal administration of oxybenzone to rats. The scientists analyzed blood, urine, feces, and tissue samples and found three metabolites: 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (DHB), 2,2-dihydroxy-4-methoxybenzophenone (DHMB) and 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzophenone (THB). To form DHB the methoxy functional group undergoes O-dealkylation; to form THB the same ring is hydroxylated. Ring B in oxybenzone is hydroxylated to form DHMB. A study done in 2004 measured the levels of oxybenzone and its metabolites in urine. After topical application to human volunteers, results revealed that up to 1% of the applied dose was found in the urine. The major metabolite detected was DHB and very small amounts of THB were found. By utilizing the Ames test in Salmonella typhimurium strains, DHB was determined to be nonmutagenic.\\"Hazardous Substances Data Bank\\". 2,4-Dihydroxybenzophenone. National Library of Medicine (US), Division of Specialized Information Services. Retrieved 19 April 2014. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) noted in their recommendations for future study that, \\"While research indicates that some topical drugs can be absorbed into the body through the skin, this does not mean these drugs are unsafe.\\" = Effects on coral = Media reports link oxybenzone in sunscreens to coral bleaching, although some environmental experts dispute the claim. A small number of studies have been released which linked coral damage to oxybenzone exposure. A 2015 study published in the Archives of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology led to ban of oxybenxzone containing sunscreen in Palau. However, the purported link between oxybenzone and coral decline is widely discussed within the environmental community since most studies on the subject have been conducted in a lab environment. A 2019 study of UV filters in oceans found far lower concentrations of oxybenzone than previously reported, and lower than known thresholds for environmental toxicity. Health and environmental regulation = Australia = Revised as of 2007, the National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS) Cosmetic Guidelines allow oxybenzone for cosmetic use up to 10%. = Canada = Revised as of 2012, Health Canada allows oxybenzone for cosmetic use up to 6%. = European Union = The Scientific Committee on Consumer Products (SCCP) of the European Commission concluded in 2008 that it does not pose a significant risk to consumers, apart from contact allergenic potential. It is allowed in sunscreens and cosmetics at levels of up to 6% and 0.5% respectively. = Japan = Revised as of 2001, the Ministry of Health, Labour, and Welfare notification allows oxybenzone for cosmetic use up to 5%. = Palau = The Palau government has signed a law that restricts the sale and use of sunscreen and skincare products that contain oxybenzone, and nine other chemicals. The ban comes into force in 2020. = Sweden = The Swedish Research Council has determined that sunscreens with oxybenzone are unsuitable for use in young children, because children under the age of two years have not fully developed the enzymes that are believed to break it down. No regulations have come of this study yet. = United States = Oxybenzone was approved for use in the US by the FDA in the early 1980s. Revised as of April 1, 2013, the FDA allows oxybenzone in OTC sunscreen products up to 6%. The Hawaii State Legislature has passed a bill that would prohibit the sale of non-prescription sunscreens containing oxybenzone and other chemicals that may be damaging to coral reefs (e.g. octyl methoxycinnamate), effective January 1, 2021. Key West has also banned the sale of sunscreens that contain the ingredients oxybenzone (and octinoxate). The ban goes into effect on January 1, 2021. The City of Miami Beach, Florida voted against a ban of oxybenzone, with commissioners citing public health concerns and lack of clarity on scientific evidence supporting such a ban.

Components which have such functionality are said to be hot-swappable or hot-pluggable; likewise, components which do not are cold-swappable or cold-pluggable. Most desktop computer hardware, such as CPUs and memory, are only cold-pluggable. However, it is common for mid-end servers, high-end servers and mainframes to feature hot-swappable capability for hardware components, such as CPU, memory, PCIe, SATA and SAS drives. A well-known example of hot swap functionality is the Universal Serial Bus (USB) connection, which allows users to add or remove peripherals such as a mouse, keyboard, printer, or portable hard drive. Such devices are characterized as hot-swappable or hot-pluggable depending on the supplier. Rationale Hot swapping is used whenever it is desirable to change the configuration or repair a working system without interrupting its operation. It may simply be for convenience of avoiding the delay and nuisance of shutting down and then restarting complex equipment or because it is essential for equipment, such as a server, to be continuously active. Hot swapping may be used to add or remove peripherals or components, to allow a device to synchronize data with a computer, and to replace faulty modules without interrupting equipment operation. A machine may have dual power supplies, each adequate to power the machine; a faulty one may be hot-swapped. Important cards such as disk controller or host adapter may be designed with redundant paths therefore upgraded or replaced if they fail without requiring the computer system to be removed from operation. System considerations Machines that support hot swapping need to be able to modify their operation for the changed configuration, either automatically on detecting the change, or by user intervention. All electrical and mechanical connections associated with hot-swapping must be designed so that neither the equipment nor the user can be harmed while hot-swapping. Other components in the system must be designed so that the removal of a hot-swappable component does not interrupt operation. = Mechanical design = Protective covering plates, shields, or bezels may be used on either the removable components or the main device itself to prevent operator contact with live powered circuitry, to provide antistatic protection for components being added or removed, or to prevent the removable components from accidentally touching and shorting out the powered components in the operating device. Additional guide slots, pins, notches, or holes may be used to aid in proper insertion of a component between other live components, while mechanical engagement latches, handles, or levers may be used to assist in proper insertion and removal of devices that either require large amounts of force to connect or disconnect, or to assist in the proper mating and holding together of power and communications connectors. = Variations = There are two slightly differing meanings of the term hot swapping. It may refer only to the ability to add or remove hardware without powering down the system, while the system software may have to be notified by the user of the event in order to cope with it. Examples include RS-232 and lower-end SCSI devices. This is sometimes called cold plugging. However, if the system can detect and respond to addition or removal of hardware, it is referred to as true hot plugging. Examples include USB, FireWire and higher- end SCSI devices. Some implementations require a component shutdown procedure prior to removal. This simplifies the design, but such devices are not robust in the case of component failure. If a component is removed while it is being used, the operations to that device fail and the user is responsible for retrying if necessary, although this is not usually considered to be a problem. More complex implementations may recommend but do not require that the component be shut down, with sufficient redundancy in the system to allow operation to continue if a component is removed without being shut down. In these systems hot swap is normally used for regular maintenance to the computer, or to replace a broken component. Connectors Sun SPARCstation hot swappable Single Connector Attachment (SCA) drive cradle Most modern hot- swap methods use a specialized connector with staggered pins, so that certain pins are certain to be connected before others. Most staggered-pin designs have ground pins longer than the others, ensuring that no sensitive circuitry is connected before there is a reliable system ground. The other pins may all be the same length, but in some cases three pin lengths are used so that the incoming device is grounded first, data lines connected second, and power applied third, in rapid succession as the device is inserted. Pins of the same nominal length do not necessarily make contact at exactly the same time due to mechanical tolerances, and angling of the connector when inserted. At one time staggered pins were thought to be an expensive solution, but many contemporary connector families now come with staggered pins as standard; for example, they are used on all modern serial SCSI disk-drives. Specialized hot-plug power connector pins are now commercially available with repeatable DC current interruption ratings of up to 16 A. Printed circuit boards are made with staggered edge-fingers for direct hot-plugging into a backplane connector. Although the speed of plugging cannot be controlled precisely, practical considerations will provide limits that can be used to determine worst-case conditions. For a typical staggered pin design where the length difference is 0.5 mm, the elapsed time between long and short pin contact is between 25 ms and 250 ms. It is quite practical to design hot-swap circuits that can operate at that speed. hot-swap connector corner pins As long as the hot-swap connector is sufficiently rigid, one of the four corner pins will always be the first to engage. For a typical two-row connector arrangement this provides four first-to-make corner pins that are usually used for grounds. Other pins near the corners can be used for functions that would also benefit from this effect, for example sensing when the connector is fully seated. This diagram illustrates good practice where the grounds are in the corners and the power pins are near the center. Two sense pins are located in opposite corners so that fully seated detection is confirmed only when both of them are in contact with the slot. The remaining pins are used for all the other data signals. Power electronics The DC power supplies to a hot-swap component are usually pre-charged by dedicated long pins that make contact before the main power pins. These pre-charge pins are protected by a circuit that limits the inrush current to an acceptable value that cannot damage the pins nor disturb the supply voltage to adjacent slots. The pre-charge circuit might be a simple series resistor, a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) resistor, or a current-limiter circuit. Further protection can be provided by a \\"soft-start\\" circuit that provides a managed ramp-up of the internal DC supply voltages within the component. A typical sequence for a hot-swap component being plugged into a slot could be as follows: #Long ground pins make contact; basic electrical safety and ESD protection becomes available. #Long (or medium) pre- charge pins make contact; decoupling capacitors start to charge up. #Real time delay of tens of milliseconds. #Short power/signal pins make contact. #Connector becomes fully seated; power-on reset signal asserted within component #Soft-start circuit starts to apply power to the component. #Real time delay of tens of milliseconds. #Soft-start circuit completes sequence; power-on reset circuit deasserted #Component begins normal operation. Hot-swap power circuits can now be purchased commercially in specially designed ASICs called hot-swap power managers (HSPMs).  Radio transmitters  Modern day radio transmitters (and some TV transmitters as well) use high power RF transistor power modules instead of vacuum tubes. Hot swapping power modules is not a new technology, as many of the radio transmitters manufactured in the 1930s were capable of having power tubes swapped out while the transmitter was running‚Äîbut this feature was not universally adopted due to the introduction of more reliable high power tubes. In the mid-1990s, several radio transmitter manufactures in the US started offering swappable high power RF transistor modules. * There was no industry standard for the design of the swappable power modules at the time. * Early module designs had only limited patent protection. * By the early 2000s, many transmitter models were available that used many different kinds of power modules. The reintroduction of power modules has been good for the radio transmitter industry, as it has fostered innovation. Modular transmitters have proven to be more reliable than tube transmitters, when the transmitter is properly chosen for the conditions at the transmitting site. Power limitations * lowest power modular transmitter: generally 1.0 kW, using 600 W modules. * highest power modular transmitter: 1.0 MW (for LW, MW). * highest power modular transmitter: 45 kW (FM, TV). Signal electronics Circuitry attached to signal pins in a hot-swap component should include some protection against electrostatic discharge (ESD). This usually takes the form of clamp diodes to ground and to the DC power supply voltage. ESD effects can be reduced by careful design of the mechanical package around the hot-swap component, perhaps by coating it with a thin film of conductive material. Particular care must be taken when designing systems with bussed signals which are wired to more than one hot-swap component. When a hot-swap component is inserted its input and output signal pins will represent a temporary short-circuit to ground. This can cause unwanted ground-level pulses on the signals which can disturb the operation of other hot-swap components in the system. This was a problem for early parallel SCSI disk-drives. One common design solution is to protect bussed signal pins with series diodes or resistors. CMOS buffer devices are now available with specialized inputs and outputs that minimize disturbance of bussed signals during the hot-swap operation. If all else fails, another solution is to quiesce the operation of all components during the hot-swap operation. Gaming Although most contemporary video game systems can interchange games and multimedia (e.g. Blu-rays) without powering down the system, older generations of systems varied in their support of hot-swapping capabilities. For example, whereas the Sony PlayStation and PlayStation 2 could eject a game disc with the system powered on, the Nintendo Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo 64 would freeze up and could potentially become corrupt if the game cartridge was removed with the power on. Manufacturers specifically warned against such practices in the owner's manual or on the game cartridge. It was supposedly for this reason that Stop 'N' Swop was taken out of the Banjo- Kazooie series. With the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive system, it was sometimes possible to apply cheats (such as a player having infinite lives) and other temporary software alterations to games by hot swapping cartridges, even though the cartridges were not designed to be hot swappable. Software Hot swapping can also refer to the ability to alter the running code of a program without needing to interrupt its execution. Interactive programming is a programming paradigm that makes extensive use of hot swapping, so the programming activity becomes part of the program flow itself. Only a few programming languages support hot swapping natively, including Pike, Lisp, Erlang, Smalltalk, Visual Basic 6 (Not VB.net), Java and most recently Elm and Elixir. Microsoft Visual Studio supports a kind of hot swapping called Edit and Continue, which is supported by C#, VB.NET and C/C++ when running under a debugger. Hot swapping is the central method in live coding, where programming is an integral part of the runtime process. In general, all programming languages used in live coding, such as SuperCollider, TidalCycles, or Extempore support hot swapping. Some web-based frameworks, such as Django, support detecting module changes and reloading them on the fly. However, although the same as hotswapping for most intents and purposes, this is technically just a cache purge, triggered by a new file. This does not apply to markup and programming languages such as HTML and PHP respectively, in the general case, as these files are normally re-interpreted on each use by default. There are a few CMSs and other PHP-based frameworks (such as Drupal) that employ caching, however. In these cases, similar abilities and exceptions apply. Hot swapping also facilitates developing systems where large amounts of data are being processed, as in entire genomes in bioinformatics algorithms. Trademarks The term \\"HOT PLUG\\" was registered as a trademark in the United States in November 1992 to Core International, Inc., and cancelled in May 1999.

He had the unique distinction of starting his military career on the very bottom rung as a pre-war militia gunner before rising through the ranks to become the first Canadian commander of the Canadian Corps. Currie's success was based on his ability to rapidly adapt brigade tactics to the exigencies of trench warfare, using set piece operations and bite-and-hold tactics. He is generally considered to be among the most capable commanders of the Western Front, and one of the finest commanders in Canadian military history. Currie began his military career in 1897 as a part-time soldier in the Canadian militia while making his living as a teacher and later as an insurance salesman and real estate speculator. Currie rose quickly through the ranks: commissioned as an officer in 1900, promoted to captain in 1901, then major in 1906 and became an artillery regimental commander in 1909. In 1913, Currie accepted the command of the newly created 50th Regiment Gordon Highlanders of Canada. Finding himself in debt following a real estate crash in Victoria, Currie embezzled ten thousand dollars earmarked for regimental uniforms into his personal accounts to pay off his debts. When the First World War broke out Canadian Minister of Militia Sam Hughes appointed Currie as commander of the 2nd Canadian Brigade. Following the Second Battle of Ypres Currie was promoted to major-general and commander of the 1st Canadian Division. Following the Battle of Vimy Ridge, Canadian Corps commander Julian Byng was promoted to general and Currie, the 1st Canadian Division commander, was promoted to lieutenant- general and assumed command of the Canadian Corps. Upon returning to Canada, Currie was promoted to general and was made Inspector-General of the Canadian Army. Although he had only a high school diploma, Currie became the principal and vice-chancellor of McGill University in 1920, holding this post until his death in 1933. Early life The farm homestead of Arthur Currie (1919) Arthur Currie was born on 5 December 1875 to William Garner Curry and Jane Patterson on their farm near the hamlet of Napperton, Ontario, just west of Strathroy. He was the third in a family of eight children and grew up on the homestead of his paternal grandparents, John Corrigan and Jane Garner. Currie's grandparents had emigrated from Ireland in 1838 to escape religious strife, and upon their arrival in Canada they had converted from Catholicism and Anglicanism to Methodism, changing the family name from Corrigan to Curry. Arthur Currie modified the spelling of his surname from Curry to Currie in 1897. Currie was educated in local common schools and at the Strathroy District Collegiate Institute, where he proved to be a good student especially interested in literature. He had plans to pursue a professional career in law or medicine; however, the death of his father at the age of fifteen made this impossible due to his limited financial means. Currie instead pursued teacher training, but he was unable to secure a job and returned to high school to complete an honours certificate in order to gain university entrance. In May 1894, mere months before his final exams, Currie quarrelled with one of his teachers, and subsequently left high school to seek his fortune in British Columbia, hoping to take advantage of the financial boom resulting from the construction of the transcontinental railway. However, Currie found no prospects outside of teaching, so he qualified as a teacher in British Columbia and took a teaching position on the Saanich Peninsula north of Victoria, British Columbia. In 1896, Currie moved to Victoria, taking a position at Boy's Central School and later Victoria High School. Early military career On 6 May 1897, Currie joined the Canadian Militia as a part- time gunner for the 5th (British Columbia) Field Artillery Regiment. Currie achieved the rank of corporal in 1900 and was soon after offered an officer's commission, which would give him a much higher status in the social circles of Victoria. A military commission was however an expensive proposition. Officers were expected to provide their own set of tailored uniforms and to donate their pay to the officer's mess. Currie was discouraged by his financial prospects as a teacher; and consequently, in February 1900, he left teaching and took a position as an insurance salesman with Matson & Coles, a local insurance firm. On 14 August 1901, Currie married Lucy Chaworth-Musters, who had been raised by Currie's aunt and uncle in British Columbia after being abandoned by her British military officer father following the death of her mother in childbirth. Officers of the 5th Regiment at Macaulay Point in 1909, Currie seated on bench third from left Currie took on his role as militia officer seriously. He attended every available course offered by the British Army Contingent at Work Point Barracks in Esquimalt, often ordered military text books from London and was found on the shooting range every Saturday. He was a keen marksman and was elected president of the British Columbia Rifle Association in 1905. Currie was promoted to captain in November 1901, and then to major in 1906. By September 1909, he had risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel, commanding the 5th Regiment. Apart from his interest in the militia, Currie was also an active Freemason, rising to the position of deputy grandmaster of the Victoria District of Freemasonry in 1907. He also served two years as president of the Young Men's Liberal Association of Victoria, and several times was suggested as a candidate for the provincial legislature. In addition to his military career, Currie continued to be active in business. He was appointed head of the Matson Insurance Firm in 1904 when Sam Matson, who had many business interests beyond his insurance firm, decided to concentrate his energy on publishing the Daily Colonist. With a land speculation boom in Victoria in full swing, Currie and a Victoria businessman, R. A. Power, formed Currie & Power in 1908. Currie invested heavily in the real estate market. The firm was a success until 1912 when property prices began to decline. In 1913, Currie's financial situation deteriorated rapidly as the value of his real estate holdings decreased and he became financially over-extended. In August, Currie's 5-year term as commander of the 5th Regiment came to a close and he faced a forced retirement from the Canadian Militia at the age of 38. At this critical juncture, he was approached to take command of a new militia regiment. Lieutenant-Colonel Arthur Currie in Highlands dress of the 50th Regiment Following the Canadian federal election of 1911, Minister of Militia and Defence Sam Hughes had ordered a rapid expansion of the national force. The large number of Scottish citizens of Victoria appealed for the formation of a Highland regiment in Victoria to augment the 88th Regiment Victoria Fusiliers, which had been formed in 1912. On 15 August 1913, the government authorized the formation of the 50th Regiment Gordon Highlanders of Canada. The originally designated commanding officer for the new regiment failed to qualify for the post and Currie was approached as a logical replacement. Currie initially turned down the idea, likely recognizing that the cost of the new Highland uniforms and mess bills would only add to his financial problems. His subordinate and friend, Major Garnet Hughes, Sam Hughes' son, was responsible for persuading Currie to reconsider and accept the position. Currie attended the Militia Staff Course conducted by Major Louis Lipsett, future commander of the 3rd Canadian Division, and qualified in March 1914. Currie was desperate to avoid personal bankruptcy, which would have resulted in a loss in social standing and forced him to resign his commission. On 31 July 1914, Currie received from the Militia Department with which to purchase new uniforms. Instead of using the funds to pay contractor Moore, Taggart and Co for the regimental uniforms, Currie embezzled the funds to pay off his personal debts. The 50th Regiment's honorary colonel, William Coy, had promised to underwrite the regiment with $35,000, and Currie planned to use the funds to pay the uniform contractor. Unfortunately for Currie, Coy did not follow through with his financial commitment to the regiment, leaving Currie's accounting sleight-of-hand potentially exposed. When World War I broke out and Canada found itself at war on 4 August 1914, Currie was offered command of Military District No. 11 ‚Äì British Columbia. When he turned this down, he was then offered command of the 2nd Infantry Brigade of the Canadian Expeditionary Force's 1st Canadian Division. Currie considered turning down this offer as well so he could attempt to solve his financial woes. He once again changed his mind at the urging of Garnet Hughes. Currie's promotion to brigadier general was confirmed on 29 September 1914, and he took command of the 2nd Brigade at the Valcartier Camp in Quebec. When the 50th Regiment's acting commanding officer, Major Cecil Roberts, wrote to him inquiring as to the status of the uniform grant, Currie ignored the correspondence and sailed overseas with his brigade in October 1914. World War I =Brigade commander= The Canadian 1st Division spent the winter of 1914‚Äì15 training in England, and were sent to France in February 1915. After a period of indoctrination in the realities of trench warfare, they took control of a section of trench in the Ypres Salient on 17 April 1915. Only five days later, the Germans used poison gas for the first time on the Western Front. French colonial troops on the Canadians' left flank broke, leaving a long hole in the Allied line. In the chaos that followed, Currie proved his worth as a leader by assessing the situation, and coolly issuing commands from his brigade headquarters even as it was gassed and then destroyed by fire. Currie cobbled together a fluid defence and counterattacked. At one point, he personally went back to the rear to try to convince two regiments of British reinforcements to move forward. After several days of fierce fighting, Allied counterattacks re- established a stable defensive line, denying the Germans a breakthrough. Currie's leadership during the Second Battle of Ypres was a source of dispute by British historian James Edward Edmonds, who argued that Currie and his 2nd Canadian Brigade performed poorly at Ypres. Currie, supported by the Canadian official historian Colonel Archer Fortescue Duguid, waged a vigorous defense, charging that Edmonds was seeking to diminish the Canadian contribution to the Second Battle of Ypres. Edmonds wrongly accused Currie of ordering his men to retreat on 24 April 1915 because of the chaos caused by the chlorine gas and fierce attacks of the German infantry; Currie and Duguid stated that it was Brigadier-General Richard Turner, commanding the 3rd Canadian Brigade on Currie's left, who had ordered a retreat without orders, leaving Currie with an exposed left flank. Canadian historian Timothy Travers also argued that Edmonds was very unfair to Currie since the 1st Canadian Division occupied a position that would have been difficult to defend even under normal conditions, without considering the effects of the first mass use of poison gas and the complete withdrawal of French forces on their left flank. Travers maintained that unlike the Algerians who fled, Currie's 2nd Brigade held its ground at Ypres, consequently losing 46% of its total strength either killed or wounded over two days of fighting. Following the battle, Currie was promoted to major-general, and given command of the entire First Canadian Division. He was also invested as a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) and as Commander of the Legion d'Honneur. =Division commander= Although the Canadians did not take part in the infamous Anglo-French offensive on the Somme on 1 July 1916, they did eventually move into the line in the fall to aid the slow crawl forward. Currie proved himself to be the master of the set- piece assault, designed to take limited objectives and then hold on in the face of inevitable German counterattacks. It was at this time that Currie lost favour with former friends Sam and Garnet Hughes. Sam Hughes wanted Garnet promoted to command of a division, but Currie, having seen Garnet in action at the Second Battle of Ypres, believed Garnet to be an incompetent officer, and refused. Currie's reputation was on the rise, and Hughes did not have the necessary leverage to force Currie to comply. By late 1916, the four Canadian divisions were in France, gathered together as the Canadian Corps under the command of Sir Julian Byng. The British High Command informed Byng that the Canadians would have a central role in the upcoming Battle of Arras by attacking Vimy Ridge, northeast of Arras on the western edge of the Douai Plains. Byng ordered Currie to study the Battle of the Somme and advise what lessons could be taken and applied. Currie was also among a set of officers who attended a series of lectures hosted by the French Army regarding their experiences during the Battle of Verdun. Currie not only questioned senior French officers but also sought out junior officers and asked the same questions, carefully noting the discrepancies between the senior officers' beliefs and the junior officers' experiences. On 20 January 1917, Currie began a series of well received lectures to Corps and divisional headquarters based on his research. In response to the Verdun visit, organizational changes were made to the platoon structure within the infantry battalions that would later become Corps wide changes. In his report, Currie evaluated not only the French tactics but also what the Canadians had done wrong in the fighting around Pozi√®res in 1916. Currie summarized the primary factors behind successful French offensive operations as: careful staff work, thorough artillery preparation and support, the element of surprise, and a high state of training in the infantry units detailed for the assault. Currie, in command of the 1st Canadian Division, was responsible for the broad southern sector of the Canadian Corps advance and expected to make the greatest advance in terms of distance. The attack was to begin at 5:30 am on Easter Monday, 9 April 1917. By the end of the first day, the 1st Canadian Division had captured all of its first line objectives and the left half of its second line. The next morning by 9:30 am, fresh troops had leap-frogged existing battalions to advance to the third objective line. To permit the troops time to consolidate the third line, the advance halted and the barrage remained stationary for 90 minutes while machine guns were brought forward. Shortly before 1:00 pm, the advance recommenced and, by 2:00 pm, the 1st Canadian Divisions secured their final objective. =Canadian Corps commander= King George V conferring the honour of knighthood on Currie on 12 July 1917 When Byng was promoted to general in command of the British Third Army in June 1917, Currie was raised to the temporary rank of lieutenant-general on 9 June, and given command of the entire Canadian Corps. Currie was knighted by King George V and appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in the King's Birthday Honours of 4 June 1917. As he was taking command of the Corps, word reached Currie that the Canadian cabinet had been informed of his embezzlement. To avoid news of the scandal from breaking, Currie borrowed money from two wealthy subordinates, David Watson and Victor Odlum, to finally pay back the money he had taken from the 50th Regiment. The British First Army commander Lieutenant-General Henry Horne ordered the Canadian Corps to relieve I Corps opposite the city of Lens on 10 July 1917, and directed Currie to develop a plan for capturing the city by the end of July 1917. The operation was intended to engage as many German formations as possible and to prevent them from reinforcing the Ypres sector during the Third Battle of Ypres. After examining the area, Currie instead proposed to take the high ground outside the city, marked on allied maps as Hill 70, hold the feature in the expectation of a German counterattack, and inflict casualties by preparing a zone of concentrated artillery and machine gun fire. Currie's plan was implemented successfully, and by the end of the battle, some 20,000 Germans had been killed or wounded at the cost of 9,000 Canadians. The operation was effective in preventing German formations from transferring local men and equipment to Ypres, and Haig believed that the Battle of Hill 70 was one of the finest minor operations of the war. The Canadian Corps was then transferred from Lens to Ypres to take part in the Battle of Passchendaele. Currie was tasked with continuing the advance started by the now exhausted II Anzac Corps in order to ultimately capture Passchendaele village and gain favourable observation positions and drier winter positions. Currie submitted his provisional operational plan on 16 October and presented a plan with extensive resources made available in reserve. He estimated the attack would result in 16,000 casualties. Currie's preparations included reconnaissance, road construction and a massing of artillery and heavy machine guns. Rather than one mass assault, Currie designed a series of well-prepared, sharp attacks that allowed the Corps to take an objective and then hold it against the inevitable German counterattacks. By 30 October, the Canadians, aided by two British divisions, gained the outskirts of the village in a driving rainstorm, and then held on for five days against intense shelling and counter-attacks, often standing waist deep in mud as they fought. The Canadians' victory came at the cost of 15,654 casualties, including 4,028 killed. Currie's grim casualty prediction had been accurate. =End of the war= By early 1918, the Canadian Corps was in a state of uncertainty. The Canadian government wanted to expand the Canadian Corps by forming a 5th Division but the BEF wanted the Canadian Corps reorganized to mirror British divisions. British command also intended to integrate American battalions into the depleted corps, which Currie predicted would be a disaster and would destroy the homogeneous structure of the corps. Currie was opposed to all of those measures since he did not view them as being in the best interests of the corps. Currie, with the aid of the Minister of Overseas Military Forces, prevailed against the structural changes. The Canadian Corps retained its original Canadian organizational structure and fought as a homogeneous formation for the entire Hundred Days Offensive. On 21 March 1918, the Germans launched a major Spring Offensive hoping to force an armistice on their terms, but by the summer their forward momentum had been contained and the Allies prepared to counterattack. In August 1918, when Currie was ordered to move the corps south to Amiens, the Canadians took pains to camouflage their move. This included sending a radio unit and two battalions to Ypres as a diversion. With no preliminary artillery bombardment at Amiens to warn the Germans, the attack on 8 August was a success. The Canadians were withdrawn from the line, and moved to the Somme, where they participated in the attack on the Hindenburg Line at the Drocourt‚ÄìQu√©ant Line on 2 September. The assault resulted in the Germans being overrun along a front. Historian Denis Winter called the seizure of the Drocourt‚ÄìQu√©ant line by the Canadian Corps the \\"greatest single achievement\\" of the British Expeditionary Force during the entire war, and praised Currie for his ability to bring \\"unprecedented\\" concentrations of artillery and machine gun together with flexible infantry sections that were adjusted for the situation. The German Seventeenth Army then retreated behind the flooded Canal du Nord. Currie took three weeks to prepare perhaps his most audacious plan: he suggested the entire corps cross the drier section of the canal on a front of only . On 27 September, the entire corps moved across the canal as planned, and then through the German lines in a series of planned zig-zag manoeuvres designed to confuse the Germans. Exhausted and demoralized, the German army staged a controlled retreat over the next five weeks. On 10 November, in what was to be his most controversial decision, Currie, under orders to continue to advance, ordered elements of the corps to liberate Mons. On the morning of 11 November, as Currie received orders confirming there would be a general armistice at 11:00 a.m., the capture of Mons was completed. In December 1918, Currie established the Canadian War Narrative Section to maintain a level of control as to how the Canadian contribution to the Hundred Days Offensive would be documented in print and presented to the public. Tim Cook argues that the Canadian War Narrative Section was an important step in not only recording and presenting the achievements of the Canadian Corps but also in restoring Currie's damaged reputation, which had been battered by Sam Hughes and his supporters in Parliament. Hughes frequently referred to Currie as a butcher. Post-war Currie and family had moved to England in 1915. They returned to Canada following the war, arriving in Halifax on 17 August 1919. No band or crowd received the ship when it docked and when Currie arrived at the Victoria Memorial Building to greet the 13th Canadian Parliament; he received a lukewarm reception. Currie was appointed Inspector- General of the Armed Forces and was then promoted to full-ranking general on 10 December, the highest ranking position in the Canadian forces. Currie intended to use the position to reform the military. However, in the post-war period, military funding was cut and Currie encountered significant opposition from the military bureaucracy to organizational changes. Deeply unhappy, Currie retired from the military, and in May 1920 accepted the position of principal and vice-chancellor of McGill University in Montreal. =McGill University= Currie as the McGill University Principal in 1930 Currie had only a high school diploma, but on the recommendation of McGill's acting principal, Frank Dawson Adams, Currie was selected as principal and vice- chancellor of McGill University on the basis of his \\"exceptional powers of organization and administration\\" and his \\"capacity for inspiration and leadership\\" rather than academic prowess. Within months of Currie's appointment, he led a fund-raising campaign to revive the university, travelling from coast to coast in a personal appeal for support; the fundraising campaign raised , significantly more than the original goal of . Currie made a name for himself as a premier university administrator. From 1925 to 1927 he served as president of the National Conference of Canadian Universities and was elected as a trustee of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching in 1927. Currie was also instrumental in saving the School for Graduate Nurses at Royal Victoria College from closure in the early 1930s. During Currie's time as McGill's Principal, the university established the Faculty of Music, the School for Graduate Nurses, and the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research, and doubled its income despite the difficulties brought on by the Great Depression. Currie was also President of the Last Post Fund from 1924 to 1932. =Libel suit= In June 1927, the city of Mons erected a plaque commemorating its liberation by the Canadian Corps nine years earlier; when this event was reported in Canadian newspapers, Currie's enemies took the opportunity to again question the necessity of the final day of fighting. A front-page editorial published on 13 June 1927 by the Hughes- friendly Port Hope Evening Guide argued that Currie was either negligent or deliberate in wasting the lives of soldiers under his command in taking Mons on the final day of the war. The newspaper had only a small local circulation, and Currie's friends advised him against pursuing the matter. However, Currie was unwilling to let the matter go, and sued the newspaper for libel, seeking $50,000 ($ today) in damages. The trial in April 1928 was front-page news across Canada. On the stand, Currie testified that he had been under orders from Allied Supreme Commander Ferdinand Foch to pursue German forces; to do otherwise would have been treason. Many of Currie's senior officers testified that Currie urged them to advance with caution, avoiding unnecessary casualties. At the end of the trial, the jury returned a verdict after four hours, finding the newspaper guilty of libel but awarding Currie only $500 ($ today) in damages, plus costs. Although Currie was awarded only a small portion of the value sought, newspapers across Canada referred to the result as a victory for him. The trial helped to restore Currie's reputation; however the stress took a toll on his health. Currie was subsequently elected Dominion president of the Canadian Legion of the British Empire Service League in 1928. However he suffered a stroke the following year and his ill health obliged him to resign, whereupon he was bestowed with the honorary title of Grand President. =Death= Funeral procession of Arthur Currie in Montreal, Quebec. Currie suffered another stroke on 5 November 1933, and died on 30 November at the age of 57 at Royal Victoria Hospital from bronchial complications brought on by pneumonia. His civilian and military funeral on 5 December was held in Montreal and was the largest to that point in Canadian history. The Times wrote of his funeral: \\"It was, by common consent, the most impressive funeral ever seen at Montreal\\" and Robert Borden believed the ceremony \\"was perhaps more elaborate than at any state or military funeral in the history of Canada\\". Approximately 150,000 people lined the streets to watch the procession and the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission broadcast the funeral over radio. Those attending the funeral included Lord Bessborough, at the time the Governor-General of Canada, important Canadian politicians, foreign diplomats and representatives of McGill University. No less than 170 organizations sent floral tributes. The service was conducted by the Bishop of Montreal at Christ Church Cathedral and was followed by a graveside service presided by Archdeacon (Hon. Colonel) John Almond, a wartime Director of the Canadian Chaplain Service for the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Eight general officers acted as pallbearers. The funeral procession received a 17-gun salute. In London a memorial service was conducted in Westminster Abbey on the same day as the funeral in Montreal, which was filled to capacity. Memorial services were held elsewhere in Canada also. On 3 December, 7,000 persons attended a memorial service for Currie at Toronto's Arena Gardens. Currie was initially interred in a family plot at Mount Royal Cemetery in Montreal. However, three years after his death, Currie's remains were moved to a more prominent site surmounted by a cross of sacrifice. Currie was survived by his wife Lucy, and a son and daughter. Lucy was left in some financial difficulty following her husband's death when McGill decided it could not afford to continue paying her a portion of his salary. In 1935, the Canadian government finally recognized his service to Canada by granting $50,000 to his estate. Honours and tribute Portrait of Currie by British war artist William Orpen, 1919 Currie was named a Companion of the Order of the Bath after the Second Battle of Ypres in 1915 and promoted Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1918 New Year Honours. He was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in the 1919 New Year Honours, and was Mentioned in Despatches nine times over the course of the war. a Currie also received a number of foreign awards, including the French L√©gion d'honneur and Croix de guerre (with Palm), the Belgian Croix de guerre and Order of the Crown, and the US Distinguished Service Medal. Currie's contributions both to the war effort as well as post-war education was recognized in 19 honorary degrees. Many tributes have been made to Currie. In 1919, General Currie Elementary School was built in Richmond, British Columbia. A Sir Arthur Currie Elementary School under the Protestant School Board of Greater Montreal was also built. Mount Currie (2810m) located at the Spray River headwaters in Banff National Park is named after Currie. The Currie Barracks in Calgary opened in 1933 was named in his honour (later renamed to CFB Calgary). In 1934, Currie was designated as a Canadian Person of National Historic Significance. The Currie Building and Currie Hall at the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario were subsequently named in his honour. In Victoria the street where Currie lived was renamed Arthur Currie Lane and an on-campus housing building at University of Victoria is named in his honour. In Strathroy, Ontario the local branch of the Royal Canadian Legion bears his name, and a statue has been raised to him. Robert A. Heinlein, in his science fiction novel Starship Troopers, named one of the basic training facilities \\"Camp Arthur Currie\\". In 2006, Canada honoured Currie as one of fourteen Canadians in the Valiants Memorial, and is one of the five people commemorated with a life-sized statue. and the Sir Arthur Currie Memorial Gymnasium at McGill University in Montreal. Currie's funeral monument in Mount Royal Cemetery. Legacy Canadian historians, including Pierre Berton and Jack Granatstein, have described Currie as Canada's greatest military commander. Although physically a large man, standing over six feet tall, Currie did not cut a heroic military figure. Nor was he a charismatic speaker. Described as aloof by his troops, who called him \\"Guts and Gaiters,\\" he nevertheless inspired them. He was a brilliant tactician who used his skills to reduce casualties and is credited with accelerating the end of the war. According to historian Jack Hyatt, \\"His slogan was, 'Pay the price of victory in shells‚Äînot lives,' and if he did anything heroic it was that.\\" Currie's leadership of the Canadian Corps was described in an article in Maclean's: \\"No flashing genius, but a capable administrator, cool headed and even tempered and sound of judgment. He has surrounded himself with a capable staff whose counsel he shares and whose advice he takes. He is the last man in the world to stick to his own plan if a better one offers. So far as tactics go he is first among equals for such is the way his staff works.\\" References Bibliography          External links * Arthur Currie at The Canadian Encyclopedia * First World War.com *Sir Arthur Currie Collection, McGill University Archives.

History Frankfurt The Institute was founded in Frankfurt am Main in 1923, where it was (and once again is) affiliated with the University of Frankfurt am Main. It was founded by Felix Weil, a student of the Marxist philosopher Karl Korsch, with an endowment provided by Weil's wealthy father Hermann Weil. Its first director, Kurt Albert Gerlach, died before making his mark, and was swiftly followed by Carl Gr√ºnberg, a Marxist historian who gathered together fellow \\"orthodox\\" Marxists at the Institute, including his former pupil Henryk Grossman. Gr√ºnberg was followed by co-founder Friedrich Pollock. Following a non-fatal heart attack, Gr√ºnberg was succeeded in 1930 by Max Horkheimer. Horkheimer rapidly became the guiding spirit of the Frankfurt School, a group of thinkers that was born under his directorship at the Institute. Horkheimer edited the group's journal Zeitschrift f√ºr Sozialforschung (Journal for Social Research) and wrote essays defining a critical theory of society. The growing influence of the Nazis led the founders to decide in September 1930 to prepare to move the Institute out of Germany, by establishing a branch in Geneva and moving the funds to the Netherlands.\\"The Origins of Critical Theory: An interview with Leo Lowenthal\\" by in Telos 49 In 1933, after the rise of Hitler, the Institute left Germany for Geneva and then in 1934 moved to New York City. In New York it became affiliated with Columbia University, and its journal Zeitschrift f√ºr Sozialforschung was renamed Studies in Philosophy and Social Science. It was there that much of the important work of the Frankfurt School thinkers began to emerge, and the Institute's residence in New York was likely partly accountable for its work's favorable reception in American and English academia. The Institute re-opened in Frankfurt in 1951 under the direction of Pollock. The Institute has been both a research enterprise and, during its Frankfurt periods, a provider of instruction in sociology at the university there. The current acting director is Ferdinand Sutterl√ºty, who has followed on from Axel Honneth's directorship of 2001 to 2018.

The terminus was designed by British born architectural engineer Frederick William Stevens, in an exuberant Italian Gothic style. Its construction began in 1878, in a location south of the old Bori Bunder railway station,Page 64 and was completed in 1887, the year marking 50 years of Queen Victoria's rule, the building being named, Victoria Terminus. In March 1996 the station's name was changed to \\"Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus\\" (with station code CST) after Shivaji, the 17th-century warrior chieftain who employed guerilla tactics to contest the declining Mughal Empire and found a new state in the western Marathi-speaking regions of the Deccan Plateau. Quote: \\"Quote: \\"Amidst this fragmented political environment a new polity emerged in the Marathi-speaking western plateau. Its founder, the charismatic and politically gifted Maratha chieftain Shivaji Bhonsle (1630-80), repeatedly used courage and savvy to outmanoeuvre his adversaries.\\" Quote: \\"Tilak also inaugurated another cult by resuscitating the memory of Shivaji, the chieftain who had originally established Mahratta fortunes in contest with the Mughals.\\" Quote: \\"Quote: First was the purely home-bred guerrilla force under Shivaji. The courageous and wily Maratha chieftain along with his successors and, subsequently, the Peshwas, defied the Mughals and other Muslim invaders for almost a century from the latter half of the seventeenth century and expanded the Maratha Empire till it covered much of the Indian heartland. During the 18th-century the state was expanded by the Peshwas to extend over many interior regions of India as the Maratha Confederacy, Quote: \\"An important accomplishment of the second peshwa, Bajirao I (1720-40), son of Balaji Vishwanath, was the creation of a Maratha Confederacy. The large territories that the Marathas had come to possess by 1720 required firm administration and military control, and while Bajirao was ably capable of providing the former, he relied on four Maratha military leaders, Raghuji Bhonsle, Damaji Gaekwar, Malhar Rao Holkar, and Ranoji Sindhia, to provide the latter.\\" or the Maratha Empire. The expansion was checked in 1761 by the Afghans in the Third Battle of Panipat, and the empire defeated by the British in 1817‚Äì18 in the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Quote: \\"The growth of Maratha power was first checked at the battle of Panipat, which was fought in 1761. ... The initiative for the third and final round of hostilities (with the British) came from the Peshwa, despite the fact that in 1802 he had placed himself voluntarily under British protection. Spurred by memories of past glory, the Peshwa placed himself at the head of a combination which sought to rid the country of British control. However, his desperate attempt to reassert his independence ended in military disaster at Kirki near Poona in 1818. Under the terms of a peace settlement, the Peshwa retired as a state prisoner to Bithur near Kanpur, while the territories under his control were taken over bv the British government. Shivaji's name is often preceded by \\"Chhatrapati,\\" a title with literal meaning, \\"a king dignified by the emblem of a parasol; a great king.\\" In 2017, the station was again renamed \\"Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus\\" (with code CSTM), where the title Maharaj has literal meaning, \\"Great king; emperor.\\" Both former initials \\"VT\\" and the current, \\"CST\\", are also commonly used. The terminus is the headquarters of India's Central Railway. It is one of the busiest railway stations in India, serving as a terminal for both long-distance- and suburban trains.  History  = Victoria Terminus = This famous landmark which has become a symbol of the city, was built as the headquarters of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway. The railway station was built to replace the Bori Bunder railway station, in the Bori Bunder area of Bombay, a prominent port and warehouse area known for its imports and exports. Since Bombay became a major port city at the time, a bigger station was built to meet its demands, and was named Victoria Terminus, after the then reigning Empress of India, Queen Victoria. The station was designed by Frederick William Stevens, a British born engineer architect, attached to the Bombay office of the Indian colonial Public Works Department. Work began in 1878. He received as the payment for his services. Stevens earned the commission to construct the station after a masterpiece watercolour sketch by draughtsman Axel Haig. The design has been compared to George Gilbert Scott‚Äôs 1873 St Pancras railway station in London, also in an exuberant Italian Gothic style, but it is far closer to Scott‚Äôs second prize winning entry for Berlin's parliament building, exhibited in London in 1875, which featured numerous towers and turrets, and a large central ribbed dome.Bombay Gothic by Christopher W London 2002 India Book House PVT Ltd The style of the station is also similar to other public buildings of the 1870s in Bombay, such as the Elphinstone College but especially the buildings of Bombay University, also designed by G G Scott. The station took ten years to complete, the longest for any building of that era in Bombay. = Missing statue = During its construction, a marble statue of Queen Victoria was installed in the main fa√ßade of the building, in a canopy under the clock. In the 1950s, authorities had begun to remove statues of the British figures from government buildings and public spaces based on a directive from the Government of India. Most of the statues, including that of Queen Victoria, were sent to Victoria Gardens (later renamed Rani Baug) where they were left lying on the grass in the open until at least the 1980s. A Right to Information report was filed, but had no records of the missing statue being exported out of India. Historians now believe that the statue was smuggled out, sold by politicians, or destroyed. The symbol of Progress, another statue, featured on the top of the dome, is often mistaken for that of Queen Victoria. = Renaming = The station has been renamed several times. It was built to replace Bori Bunder, the terminus of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway from 1853 to 1888, and was named Victoria Terminus to commemorate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. In 1996, the station was renamed to Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus in honour of Emperor Chhatrapati Shivaji, founder of the Maratha Empire. In December 2016, the Modi Ministry passed a resolution to change the name to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus in the Maharashtra Assembly and in May 2017, the home ministry officially sent a letter to the state government denoting the name change, following which the station was yet again renamed as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus. However, both the former names \\"VT\\" as well as \\"CST\\" along with the current name \\"CSMT\\" are popularly used. = 2008 Mumbai attacks = On 26 November 2008, two terrorists entered the passenger hall of the CST, opened fire and threw grenades at people. The terrorists were armed with AK-47 rifles. One of the terrorists, Ajmal Kasab, was later caught alive by the police and identified by eyewitnesses. The others did not survive. The attacks began around 21:30 when the two men entered the passenger hall and opened fire, The attackers killed 58 people and injured 104 others, their assault ending at about 22:45 after they exited the station via the North FOB towards the west to Cama hospital back entrance. The CCTV evidence was used to identify and indict Kasab. In 2010, Kasab was sentenced to death for his role in the attack, and in 2012 he was hanged.  Structure  The station building is designed in the High Victorian Gothic style of architecture. The building exhibits a fusion of influences from Victorian Italianate Gothic Revival architecture and classical Indian architecture. The skyline, turrets, pointed arches, and eccentric ground plan are close to classical Indian palace architecture. Externally, the wood carving, tiles, ornamental iron and brass railings, grills for the ticket offices, the balustrades for the grand staircases and other ornaments were the work of students at the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejebhoy School of Art. The station stands as an example of 19th-century railway architectural marvels for its advanced structural and technical solutions. The CSMT was constructed using a high level of engineering both in terms of railway and civil engineering. It is one of the first and finest products of the use of industrial technology, merged with the Gothic Revival style in India. The centrally domed office structure has a 330-foot-long platform connected to a 1,200-foot-long train shed, and its outline provides the skeleton plan for the building. CSMT's dome of dovetailed ribs, built without centering, was considered as a novel achievement of the era. The interior of the building was conceived as a series of large rooms with high ceilings. It is a utilitarian building and has had various changes required by the users, not always sympathetic. It has a C-shaped plan which is symmetrical on an east‚Äìwest axis. All the sides of the building are given equal value in the design. It is crowned by a high central dome, which acts as the focal point. The dome is an octagonal ribbed structure with a colossal female figure symbolizing Progress, holding a torch pointing upwards in her right hand and a spoked wheel in her left hand. The side wings enclose the courtyard, which opens on to the street. The wings are anchored by monumental turrets at each of their four corners, which balance and frame the central dome. The fa√ßades present the appearance of well-proportioned rows of windows and arches. The ornamentation in the form of statuary, bas-reliefs, and friezes is exuberant yet well controlled. The columns of the entrance gates are crowned by figures of a lion (representing Great Britain) and a tiger (representing India). The main structure is built from a blend of India sandstone and limestone, while high-quality Italian marble was used for the key decorative elements. The main interiors are also decorated: the ground floor of the North Wing, known as the Star Chamber, which is still used as the booking office, is embellished with Italian marble and polished Indian blue stone. The stone arches are covered with carved foliage and grotesques. Internally, the ceiling of the booking hall was originally painted blue, gold and strong red on a ground of rich blue with gold stars. Its walls were lined with glazed tiles made by Maw & Co of Britain. Outside, there are statues representing Commerce, Agriculture, Engineering and Science, with a statue representing Progress on the central dome of the station.  Platforms  CSMT has a total of 18 platforms‚Äîseven platforms are for suburban EMU trains and eleven platforms (Platform 8 to Platform 18) are for long-distance trains. Rajdhani, Duronto, Garib Rath and Tejas Express leave from Platform No. 18. Air-conditioned dormitories were inaugurated at CST on 16 April 2013. The facility has 58 beds for men and 20 for women.  In popular culture  The station has been the location of filming the \\"Jai Ho\\" song in Slumdog Millionaire; and the 2011 Indian film Ra.One.

The first passenger train ran on Konkan railway tracks on 20 March 1993, between Udupi and Mangalore. During its initial years of operation in the mountainous Konkan region, a number of accidents prompted Konkan Railway to implement new technology. Anti- collision devices, the Sky Bus and roll-on/roll-off are several of the railway's innovations. The 741-km (461-mi) line connects the states of Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka. The first train on the completed track was sent off on 26 January 1998..

History =Background= Crossing a long bridge between two hills Entering the Chiplun railway tunnel The first phase of the Konkan Railway was the section from Aptaa to Roha. It was cleared by the Planning Commission, and the project was included in the 1978-79 budget at an estimated cost of 11.19 billion. The length of the railway from Apta to Mangalore was estimated at , and its cost was estimated at 2.39 billion in 1976.https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/3086/1/lsd_07_01_01-02-1980.pdf Page no. 39 The engineering and traffic survey for the West Coast Railway Line from Apta to Mangalore was conducted from 1970 to 1972. The final survey for the Apta-Roha-Dasgaon section was made in 1974‚Äì75.https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/3269/1/lsd_07_02_19-03-1980.pdf#search=null%20[1980%20TO%201989] Page 31 =Challenges= The project involved over 2,000 bridges (of which the Panvalnadi bridge is the highest viaduct in India) and 92 tunnels and was the largest railway project of the century in Asia. A major challenge was land acquisition from about 43,000 landowners. When Konkan Railway Corporation (KRCL) began asking people to surrender property which had belonged to them for generations, many (convinced of the project's importance) did so voluntarily. This enabled the process to be completed in one year. Terrain and the elements were challenging; flash floods, landslides and tunnel collapses affected work at many places on the project. Thickly-forested construction sites were often visited by wild animals. The route crosses three states (Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka), each of which agreed to provide financing. The authorised share capital was increased in 1996-1997 from 6 billion to 8 billion, with the government of India taking a 51-percent share; the rest went to Maharashtra (22 percent), Karnataka (15 percent), Kerala (6 percent) and Goa (6 percent). Contracts for the project were given to construction firms which included Larsen & Toubro had been given major part of project, Gammon India and Afcons. To speed up construction, piers for major bridges were cast on riverbanks itself and launched with pontoon-mounted cranes. This was India's first use of incremental launch bridge-building. The greatest challenge was presented by the nine tunnels bored through soft soil, which required a slow, manual process. Excavation was difficult due to saturated clay and high water table. Tunnels collapsed immediately several times, requiring the work to be redone. Nineteen lives and four years were lost in the construction of the soft-soil tunnels alone, and a total of seventy-four people died during the railway's construction. =Controversy= In Goa, which makes up of the route, concerns were raised about the environmental and economic impact of the railway. According to opponents of the project, the coastal railway would destroy habitat, damage historical sites, and disrupt lives in the densely-populated state. In 1991, the Konkan Railway Re-Alignment Committee (KRRAC) organised protests against the proposed railway line. The KRRAC's main points were that the proposal would flood coastal regions, destroy fertile land, harm the monuments of Old Goa, irreparably damage the marshes and mangrove swamps along the coast and the estuaries of the Mandovi and Zuari Rivers, and displace neighbourhoods along the coast. The committee proposed an alternative hinterland alignment passing through relatively- unpopulated regions, which would extend the line by about but reduce environmental damage. The hinterland alignment was rejected by the Konkan Railway Corporation because it would substantially divert the line, deny rail access to Goa's population centers, and delay and increase the costs of construction. The KRRAC, which had become a political movement, filed public interest litigation in the Bombay High Court in March 1992 seeking an injunction on construction work and diversion of the line through the hinterland alignment. The high court dismissed the petition the following month, ruling that =Completion= Work progressed on the line. In March 1993, the southern between Thokur and Udupi in Karnataka was placed into service, followed by the northern section between Roha and Veer in Maharashtra in June of that year. The first passenger train on the route ran between Mangalore and Udupi on 20 March 1993. The service was extended by from Veer to Khed in March 1995, and by a further from Khed to Sawantwadi Road in December 1996. Southern service was extended by from Udupi to Kundapur in January 1995, and by a further to Pernem in Goa in August 1997. Through service between Mumbai and Mangalore remained on hold due to a problematic tunnel at Pernem, which experienced repeated cave-ins and flooding. The tunnel was finally completed in January 1998, six years after its construction began. Through services on the line began after the inauguration of the full stretch from Roha to Mangalore on 26 January 1998. Passenger service on the full route, between Mumbai and Mangalore, began in May 1998. Karwar railway station Proposed improvements According to a study by the railway, track doubling is possible on about 300 km (186 mi) which runs on the plains. Several stretches on the line can be converted to double track, such as the line from Roha to Veer. The stretch between Udupi and Mangalore is another candidate. The 88 km track from Madure to Vaibhavwadi Road is entirely flat terrain and can easily be converted into Double Track. On 3 November 2015, Konkan Railway senior official Bhanu P. Tayal announced to the press that track-doubling and electrification would begin on 8 November 8 in Kolad. Life Insurance Corporation offered a favourable 2.5 billion loan, and other funding would be available. The project, expected to cost 100 billion, was scheduled for completion by 2020. In October 2018, the railway announced that the stretch between Roha and Veer would have two tracks by December 2019. Electrification is in progress at an estimated cost of ‚Çπ8 billion, and is scheduled for completion by February 2020. The railway was scheduled to have new stations at Indapur, Goregoan Road, Sape Wamane, Kalbani, Kadwai, Verawali, Kharepatan, Achirne, Mirjan and Innanje by December 2019. Operations The railway has a total track length of . Its length through Maharashtra is , through Karnataka , and through Goa. =Passenger= The route was popular with passengers due to its connectivity with regions hitherto inaccessible by rail and the substantial time savings for travellers between western and southern India. Several trains which had taken circuitous routes ran on the Konkan Railway, reducing running time. The first of these was the Mumbai-Mangalore Netravati Express (later extended to Trivandrum), which was diverted to the Konkan Railway on 1 March 1998; this was followed by the Thiruvananthapuram Rajdhani Express on 1 April of that year. The Matsyagandha Express, running from Lokmanya Tilak Terminus to Mangalore, began service on 1 May 1998. The Hazrat Nizamuddin-Mangalore Mangala Lakshadweep Express was diverted to the route and extended to Ernakulam Junction on 1 August 1998. The Pune-Ernakulam Junction Express was introduced on 25 February 1999. The Marusagar Express, which runs between Jaipur and Ernakulam Junction and was extended to Ajmer via the Konkan Railway, began service on 12 October 2001. The Jan Shatabdi Express was flagged off between Mumbai and Madgaon (the longest-running Jan Shatabdi) on 16 April 2002 to commemorate Indian Railways' 150th anniversary. On 1 February 2008, a Garib Rath Express between the Kochuveli railway station in Thiruvananthapuram and Lokmanya Tilak Terminus began service. The Tejas Express is the first semi-high-speed, fully air-conditioned train fleet introduced by Indian Railways, with modern on-board facilities. Its inaugural run was on 24 May 2017 from Mumbai's Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus to Karmali railway station in Goa. It covered 552 km (342 mi) in eight hours and 30 minutes. =Freight= A RORO train at the Sawantwadi Road railway station Ends of tunnels are chain-locked to prevent landslides and falling rocks. Freight response to the railway was lukewarm, prompting its corporation to consider reducing its rates. With an outstanding debt of 33.75 billion, the KRCL was counting on freight traffic for revenue. To attract freight traffic, the corporation began advertising to industries on the route. The corporation introduced roll-on/roll-off (RORO) service, a road-rail system, on the section between Kolad (Maharashtra) and Verna, Goa in 1999; it was extended to the Surathkal railway station in Karnataka in 2004. The RORO service, the first of its kind in India, allowed trucks to be transported on flatcars. It has been popular, carrying about 1.6 million trucks and earning over 1.2 billion by 2009. Safety The terrain and weather of the Konkan region have caused problems for the railway. During the 1998 monsoon, torrential rains triggered landslides which washed away tracks and disrupted service. Despite the corporation's efforts to address the problems through engineering (such as protective netting along cuttings to prevent boulders from rolling onto the tracks), the problems recurred each year. The line's first major accident occurred on the night of 22 June 2003, when a landslide derailed a Karwar‚ÄìMumbai express train at the entrance to a tunnel. Fifty-one people died as a result of the accident, and others were injured. As a result, the corporation was severely criticised for failing to take adequate safety measures in the landslide-prone region. An inquiry reported that the cause of the accident was the failure of a cutting due to the lack of monsoon patrolling. The findings were disputed by the corporation, which said that the lack of monsoon patrolling did not lead to the accident (which was due to forces of nature). Shortly after the accident, however, the corporation announced that it would enhance safety measures on the route. Barely a year later, the measures were found inadequate when a second major accident occurred on 16 June 2004. A Mangalore‚ÄìMumbai Matsyaganda Express derailed and fell off a bridge after striking boulders on the tracks, killing 20 people. Again, the corporation insisted that the accident was due to forces of nature. Questions were then raised about the safety and reliability of the Konkan Railway. An inquiry by the Commissioner of Railway Safety ruled that the accident was caused by the \\"falling of boulders and earth\\" on the tracks. After the report was issued, the corporation implemented its recommendations. These included reducing train speeds during the monsoon to from and engineering measures such as boulder netting, shotcreting, rock bolting, micropiling and vetiver plantations along the line to improve safety. A goods train carrying fertilizers derailed between Diwankhavti and Khed station(83/7Km)at 15.57 Hrs on 10 May 2020. This happened during Covid-19 virus lockdown when regular passenger and goods trains were stopped by Central or Union government of India. There was no injury or casualty. The railway track was resumed for traffic on 13 May 2020 at 9.15 Hrs.

The young couple get married and have three children, a boy and two girls. Gradually perfecting her household skills, Virginia is able to get by on very little money. When, after many years, Oliver's first play is put on the stage in New York City, his expectations are high. However, the show is a complete failure as the play is far too intellectual and radical for a Broadway audience who wants to be entertained rather than reformed. Reading about the flop in the local newspaper, Virginia for the first time in her life leaves her children, asking her mother to take care of them for a day or two, and takes the night train to New York to be with, and console, her husband‚Äîonly to be rejected by him, who is in a state of severe depression. When he has recovered from the shock, Oliver makes yet another concession to society and public taste and starts writing \\"trash\\". The Alexander Strachan House, Petersburg, which figures in the novelBiallas, Randall J. \\"Data Sheet: Dr. Alexander Glass Strachan House\\". Historic American Buildings Survey, 1968-08, 4. Throughout the years, Virginia leads a vicarious life: She is happy when her husband and children are happy; she makes sure their clothes are in perfect condition while neglecting her own outward appearance; and she is eager to provide for her children the education she herself has been denied. When, at one point, she realizes that the women her age whom she has known since childhood still look quite young while she has aged prematurely, she quickly persuades herself to believe that a life of altruistic subservience is more than worthwhile, that living and acting the way she does is her duty and God's will. Her father's sudden if honourable death‚Äîhe unsuccessfully tries to prevent the lynching of an innocent young African American and is stabbed in the process by an angry and drunken young man‚Äîadds to the gloom that starts creeping into her life, especially when she sees that, as a widow, her mother suddenly loses all her will to live. When she dies only a few months after her husband, Virginia has a premonition that her own fate when losing Oliver could be a similar one. Meanwhile, Oliver's first successful play‚Äîa trashy one‚Äîpremi√®res in New York, with some more to follow in quick succession, and, as the money keeps pouring in, the family move into a bigger house in Dinwiddie. They now employ a number of servants, including an African American butler. With the children gone‚Äîtheir son and one daughter are at college, while the other daughter has married a much older widower with two grown-up children and has also flown the nest‚Äîand Oliver frequently in New York to supervise the staging of his plays, Virginia's life becomes increasingly empty. Having \\"outlived her usefulness\\", the days seem endless to her, and with all the servants about the house there is absolutely no housework for her to do either. Now in her mid- forties, Virginia for the first time in her life spends Christmas alone at home. The biggest blow, however, is yet to come: When she accompanies Oliver to New York for a premi√®re, she finds out to her dismay that he has been betraying her with a famous actress who stars in one of his plays. For the last time summoning up all her courage, she takes a taxi and pays her an unexpected call but immediately realizes when talking to her that she has no chance of winning her husband back. Without many words, Oliver asks her to let him divorce her, but clinging to the only thing she has left in her life‚Äîher marriage‚Äîshe refuses. The novel ends on a somewhat optimistic note when Virginia, again alone in the empty house in Dinwiddie, receives a letter from her son telling her that he is going to leave Oxford before he has completed his two-year course at the university in order to come back and stay with his mother.

Thomas Guide is the title of a series of paperback, spiral-bound atlases featuring detailed street maps of various large metropolitan areas in the United States, including Boise, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Oakland, Phoenix, Portland, Reno-Tahoe, Sacramento, San Francisco, Seattle, Tucson, and Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area. Road Atlas titles are Arizona including Las Vegas, California Including portions of Nevada, and Pacific Northwest covering Washington, Oregon, Western Idaho, Southwestern British Columbia. The map books are usually arranged by county; for example, separate Thomas Guides have been published for Los Angeles County and San Diego County. There are also guides that will have two or three counties combined (for example, Los Angeles and Orange County), or guides that cover a metropolitan area (for instance, the San Francisco Bay Area). Each guide has a detailed index of streets and points of interest, as well as arterial maps for easy page location. Thomas Guides were a local icon in Southern California for decades, with many companies including the Thomas Guide map grid information for their locations in Yellow Pages listings and other advertisements. History = Creation in Oakland, Ca, 1915 = Thomas Bros. Maps, the publishers of the Thomas Guide, previously known as Popular Street Atlas, Street Guide, and Popular Atlas, was started in Oakland, California, in 1915 by cartographer George Coupland Thomas and his two brothers, who were business partners. Early publications were detailed block maps, bird eye view of communities, road & highway maps, and what would be generally referred as generalized tourist maps. The company relocated its headquarters to Los Angeles in 1940. The company had grown to publish street maps of cities in several Western states; these maps were sold in fold-out, card stock covers. By the late 1940s, the company had added pocket-sized guidebooks of California and the city of San Francisco which included fold-out maps attached to the inner rear cover. The first street guides, which were initially pocket sized paperback booklets also began to appear at about this time, and were introduced for several counties in California, and one in Washington.

Wilson, digital age = After George Coupland Thomas died in 1955, the ownership was bought by Coupland Thomas's family lawyer Warren B. Wilson, brother of Lionel Wilson, the past mayor of Oakland, California. During the big California home development boom of the late 1970s Wilson moved the company to a newly built state-of-the-art designed building in the industrial park area of Irvine, California, in early 1980. For 40 years Wilson served as CEO and owner of Thomas Bros. Maps and was responsible for leading the company into the digital age. Starting in the 1990s Wilson hired many CEOs to run the company to give him more time traveling and studying his love of art. After conversion and completion of all of their pen and ink map atlases to digital format in the mid-1990s, map data became a significant part of TBM company sales. The company had large data contracts in the 1990s with the California CHP, large utilities, and many area cities and counties. The Thomas Brothers map database had a monopoly in the 1990s, since they had the best street address indexes in them, making them very good for address matching for businesses. = Acquisition by Rand McNally, decline = Because sales of its last produced guidebooks for Washington, D.C., and Virginia did not sell as expected and much money was lost on the website store design, the company was in major debt. The company also intended to conquer the East Coast, but failed to compete against existing mapmakers there. It was purchased by and became a wholly owned subsidiary of Rand McNally in 1999. The company took a new radical direction in November 2003 and let go many of Thomas Brothers' most skilled cartographers and employees. The Rand McNally CEO announced all Irvine data edits would be outsourced to Bangalore, India. The remaining Irvine employees would send and manage the data to and from India and check the map work India editors did before publishing. After January 2004, many important things in the guides were cut to save money. The valued POI index was no longer updated. Thinner and cheaper paper was used in the map guides. The Irvine source department was closed and no customer corrections were taken or recorded. Many guides were no longer printed yearly. The book name was dropped to just Thomas Guide and colors changed to match Rand McNally colors and product line releases. The popular map store was closed at the Irvine building, which was the last TBM store to close after they shut the ones in San Francisco, downtown Los Angeles, and the South Coast Plaza Mall years earlier. The map guides still sell, but the famous digital map database is now outdated. Rand McNally now buys their map data and updates from the big map digital data companies like Teleatlas and Navteq. They overlay the new streets on their old database for publication. Rand McNally/TBM no longer has any employees or customer service in California, after laying off the final Irvine headquarters employees in 2009.Milbourne, Mary Ann. \\"Did an O.C. map company sneak out of town?\\", The Orange County Register, 16 September 2010. Retrieved on 2011-01-29.  Technical and technological development  From the early days until the late 1970s, draftsmen, not cartographers, annually compiled and updated maps. Maps were drawn in various scales and sizes. As communities infilled and expanded during the post-war period, this presented problems because the early base maps did not account for the earth's curvature. Large wall maps were mosaics of smaller units making street alignment interesting. Easter-egg, or deliberate errors, were included on maps to help protect copyrights. These bugs usually were lakes, parks, or other fictitious landmarks; fictitious streets and trap streets, were avoided due to extensive use by emergency services. In this new growth period of the early 1990s the company led the way and did a lot of new innovative things in the map industry. They were the first map company to start a map education foundation that trained teachers on geography and interesting map lessons and donated map materials to area schools. They were also the first map publishing company to set up a computer map database that could have sections checked out by cartographers, updated, and then checked back in to a live digital map library with date stamps to keep track of what was edited. They also solved many software digital mapping problems that other companies still use today. And they were the first map company to set up a digital map page and grid look-up system for the whole world. Many old-time TBM map book users can still tell you what page and grid they live on, even though they stopped using the map books years ago.

(Most incidents, when clicked on, will have a Thomas Guide reference on the last line.) Businesses often use the large Thomas Guide wall maps. One common use for the wall maps is for delivery businesses, such as a local pizza restaurant. In addition, custom versions of the guides and wall maps are produced for businesses and governments that include such things as census tracts, locations of government facilities, watershed boundaries, and political boundaries. There are also CD-ROM digital editions of the Thomas Guide atlases available (Microsoft Windows only). In addition, the Thomas Brothers digital database can be licensed to companies and governments to use as a base map for geographical information systems applications. Updated editions are released annually, although according to interviews with former employees responsible for product updates, actual map content for some titles is updated only every other year. (Product covers are updated every year, even if map content has not changed.) Folding map products are created as a derivative of the Thomas Guides, which carry the Rand McNally name, but mention that the content is from the Thomas Guides. Rand McNally also releases Thomas Guide-like Street Guides and traditional fold-out versions of maps covering regions of North America not covered by the Thomas Guides.

Between 1974 and 1981 he played Battery Sergeant Major Williams in the sitcom It Ain't Half Hot Mum. His deep Welsh-accented voice was heard extensively in advertising voice-overs. Early life Davies was born in Canning Town, East London, to Welsh parents, who returned to their native village of Nant-y-Moel in 1940. Davies studied at Ogmore Grammar School He also worked as a coal miner and performed his National Service in Libya and Egypt with the East Surrey Regiment, between 1950 and 1952. Following teacher training at Bangor Teacher Training College, he taught English and Maths at Leek in Staffordshire, and at a school in the Elephant and Castle, south London. In 1957, he married Eluned Lynne Evans; she died in September 2018. The couple had five children, four daughters and a son. Davies had become active in amateur dramatics and took a short drama course at a Kew theatre company. He became a professional actor at the age of 31 and began working at the Cheltenham Rep in 1961.  Television roles  Davies' best known role was as Battery Sergeant Major Williams in the British sitcom It Ain't Half Hot Mum (1974‚Äì1981). Modelled on similar individuals Davies had met as a soldier during his National Service. \\"Bastards, real bastards some of them were. They knew it too, and took pride in it,\\" he once said. Among his character's catchphrases was \\"Shut Up!!\\", delivered as an eardrum-shattering military scream. Another phrase was \\"Oh dear, how sad, never mind\\", delivered in a dry, ironic manner, and used when others around him had problems. Davies and co-star Don Estelle had a number one hit in the UK with a semi-comic version of \\"Whispering Grass\\" in 1975. Journalist Neil Clark, contributing to The Times in 2005, described his performance as the \\"definitive portrayal of a bullying and uneducated sergeant-major\\" and reported Spike Milligan was of the opinion that Davies' role was \\"the funniest comic performance he had ever\\" watched. Other television roles included the sailor Taffy in the first of the BBC-series The Onedin Line (1971), a special branch detective in Callan (1972) and the antique dealer Oliver Smallbridge in Never the Twain (1981‚Äì1991), with Donald Sinden. In the field of science fiction television, Davies appeared in the 1967 Doctor Who story The Evil of the Daleks as Toby; and was the voice of Sergeant Major Zero (a spherical robotic soldier in charge of 100 other spherical robotic soldiers) in the 1983 Gerry Anderson-Christopher Burr production Terrahawks. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1976 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. In September‚ÄìOctober 1985, Davies played the lead role of George Vance ‚Äì a museum custodian elevated to the peerage ‚Äì in the six-part BBC2 comedy series The New Statesman. This was based on the play by Douglas Watkinson and is not to be confused with the later sitcom of the same name. (Colin Blakely played the role of Vance in a pilot episode transmitted on BBC2 in December 1984.) Davies also played in the BBC comedy sitcom Oh, Doctor Beeching!, written by David Croft and Richard Spendlove, as the Lord Mayor in an episode broadcast in 1997. Films In the cinema, Davies played major roles in two Carry On films, Behind (1975) and England (1976) ‚Äì in the latter again as a sergeant major. He played Mog in the Welsh rugby film Grand Slam (1978). He played a sergeant in the Highland Regiment in Adolf Hitler: My Part in His Downfall (1973) with Jim Dale and Spike Milligan. In 1989 he revived the role of Sergeant Major Williams in a 30 minute Royal Air Force training film, Hazardous Ops. Voice work A voice-over artist for advertisements, Davies' was heard in commercials for New Zealand's Pink Batts house insulations and confectionery ads for Cadbury's Wispa and for Heinz Curried (Baked) Beans. He also appeared alongside New Zealand rugby union coach Alex Wyllie in New Zealand advertisements for Mitre 10 hardware stores in the early 1990s. Davies and Wyllie had worked together previously on the rugby-themed film Old Scores in 1991. In the 1970s, he read an edition of BBC Radio 4's Morning Story programme, and also narrated the audiobook for the Ladybird children's classic Treasure Island. He sang and voiced many characters in the Paul McCartney film Rupert and the Frog Song in 1984 and appeared that year in the children's film Gabrielle and the Doodleman as three different characters (the Ringmaster, the Black Knight and an Ugly Sister). Also in 1984 he auditioned to be the voice of the UK's speaking clock. Later life After retiring, he lived in the south of France. He died on 17 January 2019, aged 88, four months after the death of his wife, Eluned. Davies' hobby was birdwatching. =Filmography= Davies appeared in the following films: * The Pot Carriers (1962) - Police Constable * Murder Most Foul (1964) - Sergeant Brick * The Alphabet Murders (1965) - Dragbot * Arabesque (1965) - Policeman in Car Crash (uncredited) * The Family Way (1966) - Man in Crowd (uncredited) * Drop Dead Darling (1966) - Radio Engineer * Assignment K (1968) - Bill (uncredited) * Hammerhead (1968) - Police Sergeant * Frankenstein Must Be Destroyed (1969) - Police Sergeant * Clinic Exclusive (1971) - Geoffrey Carter * Endless Night (1972) - Sgt.

The English name is a dialect form of \\"dunling\\", first recorded in 1531‚Äì2. It derives from dun, \\"dull brown\\", with the suffix -ling, meaning a person or thing with the given quality. The genus name is from Ancient Greek kalidris or skalidris, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific alpina is from Latin and means \\"of high mountains\\", in this case referring to the Alps. It is a circumpolar breeder in Arctic or subarctic regions. Birds that breed in northern Europe and Asia are long-distance migrants, wintering south to Africa, southeast Asia and the Middle East. Birds that breed in Alaska and the Canadian Arctic migrate short distances to the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America, although those nesting in northern Alaska overwinter in Asia. Many dunlins winter along the Iberian south coast. Description Adult dunlin in winter plumage, Sandy Hook, New Jersey, USA. Dunlin in late September at Easton Bavents, Suffolk, UK. Measurements: * Length: 6.3-8.7 in (16-22 cm) * Weight: 1.7-2.7 oz (48.7-75.9 g) * Wingspan: 14.2-15.0 in (36-38 cm) An adult dunlin in breeding plumage shows the distinctive black belly which no other similar- sized wader possesses. The winter dunlin is basically grey above and white below. Juveniles are brown above with two whitish \\"V\\" shapes on the back. They usually have black marks on the flanks or belly and show a strong white wingbar in flight. The legs and slightly decurved bill are black. There are a number of subspecies differing mainly in the extent of rufous colouration in the breeding plumage and the bill length. Bill length varies between sexes, the females having longer bills than the males. On the tip of the Dunlin's bill is a soft covering that fills with blood and with many nerve endings, forming a sensitive probe that is used to locate invertebrate prey in mud and sand. Although the bill can look sharp-pointed in dead specimens, in life it is blunt. =Subspecies= *C. a. arctica, (Schi√∏ler, 1922), breeds in northeast Greenland. *C. a. schinzii, (Brehm & Schilling, 1822), breeds in southeast Greenland, Iceland, the British Isles, Scandinavia & the Baltic. *C. a. alpina, (Linnaeus, 1758), breeds in northern Europe and northwest Siberia. *C. a. centralis, (Buturlin, 1932), breeds in north-central and northeast Siberia. *C. a. sakhalina, (Vieillot, 1816), breeds in eastern Russia to the Chukchi Peninsula. *C. a. kistchinski, Tomkovich, 1986, breeds around the Sea of Okhotsk to Kuril Islands and Kamchatka. *C. a. actites, Nechaev & Tomkovich, 1988, breeds on Sakhalin. *C. a. arcticola, (Todd, 1953), breeds from northwest Alaska to northwest Canada. *C. a. pacifica, (Coues, 1861), breeds in western and southern Alaska. *C. a. hudsonia, (Todd, 1953), breeds in central Canada. { Distribution of subspecies, migration routes, and major European wintering sites } Nesting Eggs, Collection Museum Wiesbaden, Germany Calidris alpina schinzii - MHNT The nest is a shallow scrape on the ground lined with vegetation, into which typically four eggs are laid and incubated by the male and female parents. Chicks are precocial, however are brooded during early development. They start to fly at approximately three weeks of age. The majority of brood care is provided by the male, as the female deserts the brood and often leaves the breeding area. The call is a typical sandpiper \\"peep\\", and the display song a harsh trill. The dunlin is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African- Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Apparent hybrids between this species and the white-rumped sandpiper as well as with the purple sandpiper have been reported from the Atlantic coasts of North America and Europe, respectively. Behaviour The dunlin is highly gregarious in winter, sometimes forming large flocks on coastal mudflats or sandy beaches. Large numbers can often be seen swirling in synchronized flight on stop-overs during migration or on their winter habitat. This bird is one of the most common waders throughout its breeding and wintering ranges, and it is the species with which other waders tend to be compared. At length and with a wingspan, it is similar in size to a common starling, but stouter, with a thicker bill. The dunlin moves along the coastal mudflat beaches it prefers with a characteristic \\"sewing machine\\" feeding action, methodically picking small food items. Insects form the main part of the dunlin's diet on the nesting grounds; it eats molluscs, worms and crustaceans in coastal areas. On the East coast of England Foraging Calidris alpina. Ystad/Sweden 2015. Dunlin are small migratory waders, however they show strong philopatry with individuals of the Southern Dunlin (Calidris alpina schinzii) in Sweden and Finland returning to, or very close to, their natal patches. Habitat fragmentation has reduced the availability of habitat patches to these birds through reducing patch size and increasing patch isolation. This reduced connectivity between patches has reduced the movements of Dunlin leaving them more susceptible to inbreeding in these locations. Future management for the conservation of Southern Dunlin should include increasing the connectivity between habitat patches.

This group is composed of those often loosely called black widow spider, brown widow spiders, and similar spiders. However, such general \\"common names\\" are of limited use as the diversity of species is much greater. A member of the family Theridiidae, this genus contains 32 species, which include several North American \\"black widows\\" (southern black widow Latrodectus mactans, western black widow Latrodectus hesperus, and northern black widow Latrodectus variolus). In addition to these in North America are also the Red Widow Latrodectus bishopi and the Brown Widow Latrodectus geometricus, which, in addition to North America, has a much wider geographic distribution. Elsewhere, others include the European black widow (Latrodectus tredecimguttatus), the Australian redback black widow (Latrodectus hasseltii), several different species in Southern Africa that can be called Button spiders, and the South American black widow spiders (Latrodectus corallinus and Latrodectus curacaviensis). Species vary widely in size. In most cases, the females are dark-coloured, but some may have lighter bodies or even reddish. Many can have red, white or brown markings on the upper-side (dorsal) of the abdomen. Some can be readily identifiable by reddish markings on the central underside (ventral) abdomen, which are often hourglass-shaped. These small spiders have an unusually potent venom containing the neurotoxin latrotoxin, which causes the condition latrodectism, both named after the genus. Female widow spiders have unusually large venom glands and their bite can be particularly harmful to large vertebrates, including humans. Only the bites of the females are dangerous to humans. Despite their notoriety, Latrodectus bites rarely cause death or produce serious complications. Description Female widow spiders are typically dark brown or a shiny black in colour when they are full grown, usually exhibiting a red or orange hourglass on the ventral surface (underside) of the abdomen; some may have a pair of red spots or have no marking at all. The male widow spiders often exhibit various red or red and white markings on the dorsal surface (upper side) of the abdomen, ranging from a single stripe to bars or spots, and juveniles are often similar to the male pattern. Females of a few species are paler brown and some have no bright markings. The bodies of black widow spiders range from in size; some females can measure in their body length. Behaviour Juvenile southern black widow (Latrodectus mactans) The prevalence of sexual cannibalism, a behaviour in which the female eats the male after mating, has inspired the common name \\"widow spiders\\". This behaviour may promote the survival odds of the offspring; however, females of some species only rarely show this behaviour, and much of the documented evidence for sexual cannibalism has been observed in laboratory cages where the males could not escape. Male black widow spiders tend to select their mates by determining if the female has eaten already to avoid being eaten themselves. They are able to tell if the female has fed by sensing chemicals in the web. Like other members of the Theridiidae, widow spiders construct a web of irregular, tangled, sticky silken fibres. Black widow spiders prefer to nest near the ground in dark and undisturbed areas, usually in small holes produced by animals, or around construction openings or wood piles. Indoor nests are in dark, undisturbed places such as under desks or furniture or in a basement. The spider frequently hangs upside down near the centre of its web and waits for insects to blunder in and get stuck. Then, before the insect can extricate itself, the spider rushes over to envenomate and wrap it in silk. To feed, the spider's mouth pulses digestive juices over the prey, which liquifies‚Äîand then the spider internalizes by capillary action, sucking the slurry into its mouth. Their prey consists of small insects such as flies, mosquitoes, grasshoppers, beetles, and caterpillars. If the spider perceives a threat, it quickly lets itself down to the ground on a safety line of silk. As with other web-weavers, these spiders have very poor eyesight and depend on vibrations reaching them through their webs to find trapped prey or warn them of larger threats. When a widow spider is trapped, it is unlikely to bite, preferring to play dead or flick silk at the potential threat; bites occur when they cannot escape. Many injuries to humans are due to defensive bites delivered when a spider gets unintentionally squeezed or pinched. The blue mud dauber (Chalybion californicum) is a wasp that, in western North America, is the primary predator of black widow spiders. The ultimate tensile strength and other physical properties of Latrodectus hesperus (western black widow) silk are similar to the properties of silk from orb-weaving spiders that had been tested in other studies. The tensile strength for the three kinds of silk measured in the Blackledge study was about 1,000 MPa. The ultimate strength reported in a previous study for Trichonephila edulis was 1,290 ¬± 160 MPa. The tensile strength of spider silk is comparable to that of steel wire of the same thickness. However, as the density of steel is about six times that of silk, silk is correspondingly stronger than steel wire of the same weight. Spiders of the genus Steatoda (also of the Theridiidae) are often mistaken for widow spiders, and are known as \\"false widow spiders\\"; while their bite can be painful, they are significantly less harmful to humans. Taxonomy Male L. elegans from Japan L. hesperus hair and markings L. hesperus profile Ventral side of a L. geometricus displaying the hourglass marking Dorsal side of a L. geometricus in Colorado, United States L. hesperus with egg sac L. tredecimguttatus (female swollen with eggs) The genus Latrodectus was erected by Charles Athanase Walckenaer in 1805, for the species Latrodectus tredecimguttatus and Latrodectus mactans. Arachnologist Herbert Walter Levi revised the genus in 1959, studying the female sexual organs and noting their similarity across described species. He concluded the colour variations were variable across the world and were not sufficient to warrant species status, and reclassified the redback and several other species as subspecies of the black widow spider. Levi also noted that study of the genus had been contentious; in 1902, both F. O. Pickard-Cambridge and Friedrich Dahl had revised the genus, with each criticising the other. Cambridge questioned Dahl's separating species on what he considered minor anatomical details, and the latter dismissed the former as an \\"ignoramus\\". =Species= the World Spider Catalog accepted the following species: *Latrodectus antheratus (Badcock, 1932) ‚Äì Paraguay, Argentina *Latrodectus apicalis Butler, 1877 ‚Äì Galapagos Islands *Latrodectus bishopi Kaston, 1938 ‚Äì USA *Latrodectus cinctus Blackwall, 1865 ‚Äì Cape Verde Is., Africa, Kuwait, Iran *Latrodectus corallinus Abalos, 1980 ‚Äì Argentina *Latrodectus curacaviensis (M√ºller, 1776) ‚Äì Lesser Antilles, South America *Latrodectus dahli Levi, 1959 ‚Äì Morocco to Central Asia *Latrodectus diaguita Carcavallo, 1960 ‚Äì Argentina *Latrodectus elegans Thorell, 1898 ‚Äì India, Myanmar, Thailand, China, Japan *Latrodectus erythromelas Schmidt & Klaas, 1991 ‚Äì India, Sri Lanka *Latrodectus geometricus C.

In North America, the black widows commonly known as southern (Latrodectus mactans), western (Latrodectus hesperus), and northern (Latrodectus variolus) are found in the United States, as well as parts of southern Canada ‚Äì particularly in the Okanagan Valley of British Columbia, as can the \\"grey\\" or \\"brown widow spiders\\" (Latrodectus geometricus) and the \\"red widow spiders\\" (Latrodectus bishopi).Preston- Malfham, 1998. The most prevalent species occurring in eastern Asia and Australia is commonly called the redback (Latrodectus hasselti). Bite Due to the presence of latrotoxin in their venom, black widow bites are potentially dangerous and may result in systemic effects (latrodectism) including severe muscle pain, abdominal cramps, hyperhidrosis, tachycardia, and muscle spasms. Symptoms usually last for 3‚Äì7 days, but may persist for several weeks. In the United States each year, about 2,200 people report being bitten by a black widow, but most do not need medical treatment. Some bites have no venom injected‚Äî‚Å†a \\"dry\\" bite. In the United States, no deaths due to black widows have been reported to the American Association of Poison Control Centers since 1983. Black widows are not especially aggressive spiders, and they rarely bite humans unless startled or otherwise threatened.Why Black Widow Spider Venom Is So Potent. By Jennifer Viegas, Discovery News January 6, 2015 Contrary to popular belief, most people who are bitten suffer no serious damage, let alone death. Fatal bites were reported in the early 20th century mostly with Latrodectus tredecimguttatus, the Mediterranean black widow. Since the venom is not usually life-threatening, antivenom has been used as pain relief and not to save lives. However, a study demonstrated that standardized pain medication, when combined with either antivenom or a placebo, had similar improvements in pain and resolution of symptoms.

It is a component of coal tar. Anthracene is used in the production of the red dye alizarin and other dyes. Anthracene is colorless but exhibits a blue (400‚Äì500 nm peak) fluorescence under ultraviolet radiation. Occurrence and production Coal tar, which contains around 1.5% anthracene, remains a major source of this material. Common impurities are phenanthrene and carbazole. The mineral form of anthracene is called freitalite and is related to a coal deposit.Freitalite, Mindat, https://www.mindat.org/min-54360.html A classic laboratory method for the preparation of anthracene is by cyclodehydration of o-methyl- or o-methylene-substituted diarylketones in the so-called Elbs reaction. Reactions =Reduction= Reduction of anthracene with alkali metals yields the deeply colored radical anion salts M+[anthracene]‚àí (M = Li, Na, K). Hydrogenation gives 9,10-dihydroanthracene, preserving the aromaticity of the two flanking rings. =Cycloadditions= Anthracene photodimerizes by the action of UV light: :Anthracene dimer The dimer, called dianthracene (or sometimes paranthracene), is connected by a pair of new carbon-carbon bonds, the result of the [4+4] cycloaddition. It reverts to anthracene thermally or with UV irradiation below 300 nm. Substituted anthracene derivatives behave similarly. The reaction is affected by the presence of oxygen. Anthracene also reacts with dienophile singlet oxygen in a [4+2]-cycloaddition (Diels‚ÄìAlder reaction): :Diels alder reaction of anthracene with singlet oxygen =With electrophiles= Chemical oxidation occurs readily, giving anthraquinone, C14H8O2 (below), for example using hydrogen peroxide and vanadyl acetylacetonate. :Anthraquione Electrophilic substitution of anthracene occurs at the 9 position. For example, formylation affords 9-anthracenecarboxaldehyde. Substitution at other positions is effected indirectly, for example starting with anthroquinone. Uses Anthracene is converted mainly to anthraquinone, a precursor to dyes.Collin, Gerd; H√∂ke, Hartmut and Talbiersky, J√∂rg (2006) \\"Anthracene\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. =Niche= Anthracene, a wide band-gap organic semiconductor is used as a scintillator for detectors of high energy photons, electrons and alpha particles. Plastics, such as polyvinyltoluene, can be doped with anthracene to produce a plastic scintillator that is approximately water-equivalent for use in radiation therapy dosimetry. Anthracene's emission spectrum peaks at between 400 nm and 440 nm. It is also used in wood preservatives, insecticides, and coating materials. Anthracene is commonly used as a UV tracer in conformal coatings applied to printed wiring boards. The anthracene tracer allows the conformal coating to be inspected under UV light.Zeitler, Alex (2012-06-27) Conformal Coating 101: General Overview, Process Development, and Control Methods. BTW, Inc. Anthracene also used in manufacturing of anthraquinone. =Derivatives= AFM image of anthracene diradical, where hydrogen atoms are removed at carbons 9 and 10 A variety of anthracene derivatives find specialized uses. Derivatives having a hydroxyl group are 1-hydroxyanthracene and 2-hydroxyanthracene, homologous to phenol and naphthols, and hydroxyanthracene (also called anthrol, and anthracenol)1-Hydroxyanthracene. NIST datapage2-Hydroxyanthracene. NIST datapage are pharmacologically active. Anthracene may also be found with multiple hydroxyl groups, as in 9,10-dihydroxyanthracene. Occurrence Anthracene, as many other polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, is generated during combustion processes. Exposure to humans happens mainly through tobacco smoke and ingestion of food contaminated with combustion products. Toxicology Many investigations indicate that anthracene is noncarcinogenic: \\"consistently negative findings in numerous in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity tests\\".

He was notable for being the last Liberal-Conservative cabinet minister, until he was dismissed from his cabinet post. Early life Hughes was born January 8, 1853, at Solina near Bowmanville in what was then Canada West. He was a son of John Hughes from Tyrone, Ireland, and Caroline (Laughlin) Hughes, a Canadian descended from Huguenots and Ulster Scots. He was educated in Durham County, Ontario and later attended the Toronto Normal School and the University of Toronto. In 1866 he joined the 45th West Durham Battalion of Infantry and served during the Fenian raids in the 1860s and 1870s. Throughout his life, Hughes was very involved in the militia, attending all of the drill practice sessions, and taking up shooting with a rifle in his spare time to improve his aim. A superb shot with a rifle, Hughes was active in gun clubs and ultimately became president of the Dominion Rifle Association. Hughes liked to see himself as embodying the Victorian values of hard work, self discipline, strength and manliness. Tall, muscular, and broad-shouldered, Hughes excelled at sports, being especially talented at lacrosse. He later claimed, in the British Who's Who, to have \\"personally offered to raise\\" Canadian contingents for service in \\"the Egyptian and Sudanese campaigns, the Afghan Frontier War, and the Transvaal War\\".Note the order in which they are quoted is not chronological. At the age of 20, he married his first wife, Caroline Preston, who died a year later. Subsequently, he married Mary Burk, and the new couple soon moved to Toronto. He was a teacher from 1875 to 1885 at the Toronto Collegiate Institute (now Jarvis Collegiate), where he was noted for his eccentricities such as his habit of chewing on his chalk when delivering his lectures. Hughes abandoned teaching as he had trouble supporting a wife and three children on his salary while teaching offered little prospect of promotion. In 1885, he moved his family to Lindsay, where he had bought The Victoria Warder, the local newspaper. He was the paper's publisher from 1885 to 1897. In his first editorial, Hughes accused the Roman Catholic Church of being behind the smallpox epidemic that was ravaging Montreal at the time and called French- Canadians \\"little better than brutes\\". Shortly after he began his proprietorship of the Victoria Warder in July 1885, Hughes joined the local Liberal-Conservative Association. The Prime Minister, Sir John A. Macdonald, often commented that Hughes's letters to him were \\"voluminous\\" and sometimes \\"impertinent\\" as he demanded patronage jobs for local Tories. Macdonald also noted in 1888 that \\"Sam Hughes is one of our best friends\\", as the Victoria Warder very strongly supported the Conservatives, making him a useful man for the Tories in the rural Victoria County, where most people got their news from his newspaper. At the time when Hughes arrived in Victoria County, it was a mostly forested area where lumbering was the chief industry, though agriculture was increasing as the trees were cut down. Most of the towns and villages in Victoria County were isolated settlements located on the lakes and connected only by water and by primitive roads. The population of the County was overwhelmingly of British descent and Protestant. On the masthead of the Victoria Warder, Hughes put the following poem: \\"A Union of hearts, a Union of hands, A Union no man can sever, A Union of tongues, A Union of lands, And the flag-British Union forever\\". Hughes had much affection for the rugged landscape of the County, talking about its forests and lakes in the same manner he praised the Highlands of Scotland and the rolling fields of Ulster. His grandson wrote that for Hughes Victoria County was his \\"spiritual home\\". Victoria County in the 19th century was considered to be a \\"rough\\" frontier area, and during his tempestuous time as editor, Hughes was sued for libel, there was an arson attempt against the Victoria Warder and was at least one assassination attempt against him when he was shot at while leaving his newspaper office. In 1885, Hughes tried to volunteer for the expeditionary force sent to put down the North-West Rebellion led by the Metis Louis Riel, but he was refused despite being a very active member of the militia. Hughes's younger brother, James, was part of the force sent to the Northwest Territory (modern Saskatchewan) and to compensate for being not able to fight, he gave the war extensive coverage in The Victoria Warder. Reflecting his life-long belief in the superiority of citizen soldiers over professional soldiers, Hughes presented the Northwest Rebellion as a triumph of the Canadian militia, proudly trumpeting the fact that almost all of the men sent to the Northwest had been civilians only weeks before donning their uniforms to head west. About the Canadian victory in the Battle of Batoche, Hughes wrote in an editorial that \\"regular troops were all right for police purposes in times of peace and for training schools, but beyond that they are an injury to the nation\\". A recurring theme of Hughes's writing in the Victoria Warder was the fear that industrialization and urbanization might lead to a loss of masculinity, and that the best way to save traditional masculinity was compulsory militia service for all Canadian men. Hughes equated masculinity with toughness, and argued that militia service would toughen up Canadian men who might otherwise go soft living in an urban environment full of labor- saving devices. As one of his arguments for the militia, Hughes played a key role in creating what the Canadian historian Desmond Morton called the \\"militia myth\\" around the War of 1812; namely, he misrepresented Upper Canada as being saved from successive American invasions in 1812, 1813 and 1814 by the Upper Canada militia, instead of the British Army regulars, who in fact did most of the fighting. Another theme of Hughes's coverage of the Northwest Rebellion was the way in which he essentially agreed with Riel that the stream of English-speaking, Protestant settlers from Ontario into the Prairies were indeed threatening the existence of the Catholic religion and French language of the Metis, with the only difference that what Riel saw as a tragedy, Hughes saw as a blessing. Victoria County had as a percentage of the population the largest number of Orangemen in Canada in the late 19th century, and Hughes who sat on the executive board of the local Lodge of the Loyal Orange Order in the County was able to use the Orangemen to provide a reliable group of voters when seeking election to the House of Commons throughout his career. The combative Hughes enjoyed brawling with Irish Catholic immigrants on trips to Toronto. As an editor of the Victoria Warder, Hughes often attacked \\"Romanists\\" as he called Catholics. For an example in an editorial on 4 October 1889 he accused the \\"Romanists\\" of Lindsay of being \\"a disloyal murder-planning society\\". After Wilfrid Laurier, the new Liberal Leader of the Official Opposition, spoke in favor of free trade with the United States, Hughes accused him in an 1888 editorial of being in favor of having Canada annexed by the United States. To counter Laurier's argument that free trade with the United States meant prosperity, Hughes proposed an Imperial Federation with Great Britain as the best way to bring about prosperity, though he also held out the possibility that the United States might one day join to create a union of the English-speaking peoples. Member of Parliament In the 1891 election, Hughes ran as a Conservative to represent Victoria County, but was narrowly defeated by only 202 votes by the Liberal incumbent, Jack Barron. Charging electoral fraud, Hughes went to court to challenge the result. Two justices at the Queen's Bench in Toronto ruled that the evidence of electoral fraud presented by Hughes was overwhelming, and ordered a by-election, held on 11 February 1892. During the by-election, Barron twice tried to bribe Hughes to drop out. Hughes was elected to Parliament in the by-election. In January 1894, Hughes was involved in a brawl on Lindsay's main street with a Roman Catholic blacksmith named Richard Kylie, which led him to being convicted of assault and fined $500 dollars. Despite expectations that the assault conviction would cause him to lose his seat, in the 1896 election, Hughes kept his seat. In 1870, when the province of Manitoba was created out of the Northwest Territory as part of the political deal to end the Red River Rebellion, Manitoba had a French-speaking Metis majority and it was declared in the Manitoba Act creating the province that French was one of Manitoba's official languages and the province was to provide Catholic education in French. By 1890, immigration from Ontario had changed the demographics of Manitoba drastically and in that year the Manitoba government passed a law making all education in English under the grounds that French-language education was costing too much money. This in turn led to demands for the Dominion government to intervene as this law violated the Manitoba Act. The Manitoba Schools Question proved to be one of the most bitterly divisive issues of the 1890s, and Hughes emerged as a spokesman for those who urged the Dominion government not to intervene, arguing that if Manitoba did not wish to provide education in French, that was its right. Hughes justified his views under the grounds of secularism, writing in 1892 \\"all churches are a simple damned nuisance\\". Despite his anti-Catholic stance, Hughes supported the claims of the Catholic John Thompson to be Prime Minister. Hughes's support for Thompson was based upon political expediency, namely that Thompson was the best man to beat the popular Wilfrid Laurier. Hughes used his influence with the Orange Order to try to keep them from inflaming the Manitoba Schools Question, and to convince them to accept Thompson as the next Conservative leader to replace the ailing Sir John Abbott. As Thompson represented a more upper-class, urban wing of the Conservative Party, the support of Hughes who represented a more lower-class, rural wing of the Conservatives was instrumental in assuring Thompson became Prime Minister in November 1892 when Abbott finally resigned. He also tried to persuade the Orangemen to accept a Catholic prime minister. During Thompson's time as Prime Minister, Hughes supported his efforts to find a compromise to the Manitoba Schools Question, though he notably stopped writing as often to the prime minister after Thompson decided in 1894 to pass a remedial bill to force Manitoba to abide by the Manitoba Act. When Thompson died in December 1894, Hughes supported the candidacy of Sir Charles Tupper against Senator Mackenzie Bowell, who prevailed and became the next prime minister. As the debate intensified into a crisis in 1895-96 following a ruling by the Privy Council against Manitoba, Hughes took a generally moderate position on the Manitoba Schools Question, asking rhetorically in a letter to the editor of the Ottawa Journal \\"why should we plunge Canada into a religious war?\\" In a letter to Nathaniel Clarke Wallace, the Grand Master of the Orange Order, he advised against extremism on the Manitoba Schools Question, saying the issue was tearing the Conservative Party apart. Faced with certain defeat in the 1896 election, Hughes was one of the Conservative MPs who voted in March to depose Bowell in favor of Tupper. Hughes supported Tupper's \\"friendly means\\" compromise of secular education in Manitoba with religious instruction after the school day had officially ended. Wallace disregarded Hughes's advice and in 1896 stated that the Orangemen would only support candidates who stood against the federal remedial bill against Manitoba, which in effect meant supporting the Liberals. Laurier, despite being a French-Canadian Catholic, supported Manitoba under the grounds of provincial rights, and had the Liberals filibuster Tupper's remedial bill. At a national meeting of the Orange Order in Collingwood in May 1896, Hughes spoke in favor of Tupper and was almost expelled from the Order. In the 1896 election, Hughes's main challenger was John Delemere, an independent candidate endorsed by Wallace. Hughes held on to his seat by arguing that the affairs of Manitoba were irrelevant to Victoria County and he understood local issues far better than his opponent. The election of 1896 resulted in a Liberal victory, and in the new, much smaller Conservative caucus, Hughes stood out as the few MPs whose reputation had been enhanced by the Manitoba Schools Question. Hughes's position on the Question was based upon pragmatism, namely the need to keep the Conservatives united to win the next general election in face of the challenge from Laurier, whose \\"sunny ways\\" were winning over people all over Canada. Unlike other Conservative MPs like George Foster who argued that the Manitoba Act had guaranteed the right to a Catholic education in French, and it was the duty of the Dominion government to uphold the law, Hughes had no interest in minority rights. Hughes felt that a secular education system was superior to a religious one, and that the language of instruction in Manitoba schools should be English. His moderate stance on the Manitoba Schools Question was motivated entirely by the fear that the issue might cause the Conservatives to lose the next general election, as indeed proved to be the case. Despite the fact that Wallace had campaigned against him, Hughes tried to rebuild the relationship between the Conservatives and the Orange Order, through it was not until Wallace died in 1901 that his efforts bore fruit. The returned Prime Minister Wilfrid Laurier had declared his support for the British policies in South Africa, but was non-committal about sending Canadian troops if war should break out. In the summer of 1899, the Governor General of Canada, Lord Minto, and the commander of the Canadian Militia, Colonel Edward Hutton, drafted a secret plan for a Canadian contingent of 1,200 men to go to South Africa, and decided that Hughes as one of the most outspokenly imperialist Members of Parliament was to be one of the commanders. In September 1899, Minto and Hutton first informed Frederick William Borden, the Minister of Militia and Defence, of the plan that they had drafted, though Laurier remained out of the loop. As Laurier continued to hesitate, Hughes offered to raise a regiment at his own expense to fight in South Africa, an offer which threatened to upset Hutton's plans as Hughes's offer gave Laurier the perfect excuse for doing nothing. When Hutton ordered Hughes as a subordinate militia officer to remain silent, Hughes responded with an angry outburst in public alleging an attempt by a British officer to silence a Canadian MP, creating what the Canadian historian Desmond Morton called a clash of \\"two like-minded, but out-sized egos\\". Boer War service On 3 October 1899, the Transvaal Republic declared war on Great Britain. The Secretary of State for the Colonies, Joseph Chamberlain, sent Laurier a note thanking him for his offer of Canadian troops to South Africa, which confused the prime minister as he made no such offer. At the same time the October 1899 edition of the Canadian Military Gazette published the details of the plan to send 1,200 men to South Africa. When Laurier denied in the House of Commons having any plans to send troops, Chamberlain's note was leaked to the press, and on 9 October 1899, Laurier received a note from editor of the Toronto Globe (which supported the Liberals) saying the prime minister must \\"either send troops or get out of office\\". As the Liberal caucus was badly divided between French-Canadian MPs opposed to the Boer War and pro-War English- Canadian MPs, Laurier did not dare summon Parliament for a vote as the Liberals might split over the issue, and instead issued an order-in-council on 14 October saying that Canada would provide a force of volunteers for South Africa. Hughes promptly volunteered for the contingent, but was vetoed by Hutton who had neither forgotten nor forgiven Hughes for his insubordination and his abrasive refusal to be silenced; however, perhaps as a form of revenge against Hutton, Laurier insisted that Hughes be allowed to go to South Africa. Having convinced Laurier to send Canadian troops, Hughes embarked to serve in the Second Boer War. Upon boarding the ship SS Sardinian which left Quebec City for Cape Town on 31 October 1899, carrying 1,061 Canadian volunteers, Hughes announced that he was free of all military authority and would take no orders from any officer. Upon arriving in South Africa, Hughes told the press that the Boers \\"on their old plugs of horses\\" would out-ride the British on the veld, a remark that marked the beginning of Hughes's stormy service in South Africa as ironically the ultra-imperialist Hughes constantly clashed with the British Army. Hughes developed a strong contempt for the British military while in South Africa and came away with the idea that frontier living had made the Canadians tougher and hardier soldiers than the British. The Canadian historian Pierre Berton wrote that Hughes \\"hated the British Army\\". Hughes always believed the part-time citizen soldiers of the Canadian militia were far better soldiers than the full-time professionals of the British Army, a viewpoint that did much to influence his later decisions in World War I. In this regard, the performance of the Boer kommandos (commandos) was used by Hughes to prove his point, as he argued that the citizen militias of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State had out-fought the British Army for much of the war, though he ignored the fact that in the end it was the British Army that won the war. Hughes also used the performance of irregular cavalry units from Canada and Australia to support his theory, noting that the \\"cowboy\\" units recruited from the Australian outback and the Canadian Prairies were the ones most effective at hunting down the kommandos. Hughes's biographer, Ronald Haycock noted that he naively assumed that all future wars would be like the Boer War, even right down to being fought in a place like the veld. Haycock also noted that Hughes seemed to have no interest in understanding why the commandos had been defeated, instead presenting the war as almost a Boer victory. It was also during the War that Hughes become convinced of the thesis that the Ross rifle developed by a Scottish sportsman, Sir Charles Ross, and manufactured in Canada was the ideal weapon for infantrymen. The more that the British Army rejected the Ross rifle as unsuitable, the more it persuaded Hughes of its superiority, though Morton noted that the British objections to the Ross rifle were sound as it was a hunting rifle that overheated after rapid firing and was too easily jammed by dirt. However, despite his frequent clashes with British Army officers, Sir Alfred Milner, the British High Commissioner for South Africa, praised Hughes for his willingness to by-pass bureaucracy and to get things done. Two men who were later prominent in Milner's Kindergarten, William Hitchens and Lionel Curtis both served under Hughes's command from March 1900 onward as they advanced across the veld from the Cape Colony into the Orange Free State. Outside of Hughes's own accounts of his Boer War service, most of what is known about his time in South Africa comes from the accounts written by Hitchens, and Curtis and their mutual friend, Leo Amery, the war correspondent of The Times of London, who first met Hughes in Cape Town in December 1899 together with another mutual friend, Max Balfour. Amery, Balfour, Curtis and Hitchens all described Hughes as a populist leader who was not aloof from the common soldiers, impatient with bureaucracy, forthright about expressing his opinions about everything, and who shared the hardships on war on the veld. Balfour wrote that Hughes was chivalrous towards Boer civilians, apologising to the wife of a man he arrested as a guerrilla for taking away her husband while Curtis stated that Hughes always paid for the food he had taken from farms out on the veld, saying he was no thief. Amery described Hughes as a hard-driving, aggressive commander whose cavalry covered vast distances across the veld, saying he was relentless in his pursuit of the enemy. In a promotion, in May 1900, Milner had Hughes made the intelligence officer and assistant adjutant general to Warren's Scouts commanded by Sir Charles Warren, which had the task of advancing over the Orange river to neutralise a Transvaal force under the command of Commandant-General Piet de Villers. During the advance, de Villers attacked the British camp at the Faber Pass outside of Campbell on 27 May 1900, and a half-dressed Hughes who sprung into action after waking up at the sound of the shooting, was involved in leading the counterattack that drove the Transvaalers back at the cost of 23 dead and 33 wounded. Afterwards, Hughes attacked Warren for \\"absolutely untrue\\" statements in his official report about the action at the Faber Pass such as his claim that he was not taken by surprise and the camp was well situated, criticism which Haycock described as very well merited. Hughes would continually campaign, unsuccessfully, to be awarded a Victoria Cross (V.C.) for actions that he had supposedly taken in the fighting. The Canadian historian Ren√© Chartrand wrote that \\"...Hughes's character may be read from the fact that he had actually asked for the V.C. for his services in South Africa\\". Hughes's recommendation of himself for a V.C. was most unorthodox as normally one had to be recommended for the award. Hughes published most of his own accounts of the war, often saying that when he left, the British commander was \\"sobbing like a child.\\" In fact, Hughes was dismissed from Boer War service in the summer of 1900 for military indiscipline, and sent back to Canada. Letters in which Hughes charged the British military with incompetence had been published in Canada and South Africa. Hughes had also flagrantly disobeyed orders in a key operation by granting favourable terms to an enemy force which surrendered to him. Although Hughes had proved a competent, and sometimes exceptional, front-line officer, boastfulness and impatience told strongly against him. Hughes's demand for a V.C. was refused, but as a consolation prize, his demand for to be knighted for his Boer War services was granted, albeit only belatedly in 1915, and therefore Hughes was proud to be known as \\"Sir Sam\\". By this time, Hughes had become convinced that he deserved not one, but two V.C.s for his service in South Africa, a demand that exasperated the War Office in London who patiently told Hughes one could not recommend oneself for the V.C., and his requests for a V.C. bar could not be considered. Shadow defense minister As the defense critic in the Conservative shadow cabinet, Hughes who was widely read on military history, current military trends, and issues in the Canadian militia proved a vigorous and effective shadow defense minister, accusing the defense minister, Sir Frederick Borden, of being ineffectual in handling his portfolio. Hughes was also well known for his attacks upon the immigration policy of the Laurier government, charging that Canada needed more immigrants of \\"good British stock\\". The subject of settling the Prairies much interested Hughes as he served as an agent between 1902-1905 for the Canadian Northern Railway headed by his friend, William Mackenzie, travelling twice to the Prairies to select the route for the CNR. Amery, having first met Hughes in the Boer War, followed him on his second trip across the Prairies, writing about how he talked with great passion about his plans to build the \\"finest city\\" on the Prairies. In the 1904 election, the Liberals triumphed in a landslide, and even Hughes held on to his seat in Victoria County by a narrow margin. The Conservative leader, Robert Borden, lost his own seat in Halifax, and Hughes offered to resign to allow Borden to represent Victoria County. Though Borden chose another safe Conservative seat in Ontario to represent, he thanked Hughes for his \\"kindness\\" in offering up his own seat. Hughes was also active in the Imperial Federation movement, regularly corresponding with both Joseph Chamberlain and Alfred Milner on the issue, and every year from 1905 onward, introduced a resolution in the House of Commons calling for an \\"equal partnership union\\" of the Dominions with the United Kingdom. In this, Hughes often confounded Milner and Chamberlain, who thought he was the foremost Canadian champion of the Imperial Federation concept, as what Hughes wanted was for Canada to become an equal partner in running the British empire, instead of playing the more subordinate role that Milner and Chamberlain had envisioned. Hughes favored a protectionist policy of Imperial Preference, but unlike Chamberlain, he insisted that Imperial Preference be tied to \\"equal partnership\\" with an Imperial cabinet of all the Dominion prime ministers plus the British prime minister to decide policy for the entire empire. Hughes repeatedly objected to Chamberlain's concept of the British prime minister and cabinet deciding questions for the Dominions, and Haycock wrote what Hughes wanted sounds very similar to the British Commonwealth that emerged after 1931. In 1906, after repeatedly hammering the immigration minister, Clifford Sifton in debate, Hughes's motion calling for the Canadian government to give preference in handing out land in the Prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba to veterans of the British Army was accepted as policy. Like other English-Canadians at the time, Hughes believed that too many immigrants from Eastern Europe were being allowed to settle on the Prairies, and instead the Prairies should be settled by immigrants from Britain, with veterans in particular encouraged to settle. In 1907 Hughes told the House of Commons that Catholic immigrants from Europe were \\"a curse upon Canada\\". Despite being publicly censured by the Conservative leader Robert Borden for his \\"curse upon Canada\\" remark with Borden insisting that the Conservative Party was not a sectarian party, two months later in June 1907 at the Orange Order's national convention in Vancouver, Hughes repeated his thesis that Catholic immigrants were a \\"curse upon Canada\\", which was followed up with the warning that the Orangemen would never vote Conservative again if Borden expelled Hughes. Hughes's ability to bring out the votes of the Orange Order for the Conservatives ensured that Borden did not expel him despite the way in which he kept sabotaging Borden's efforts to reach out to Catholic voters. Hughes, who claimed to have been offered but declined the post of Deputy Minister of Militia in 1891, was appointed Minister of Militia after the election of Borden in 1911, with the aim of creating a distinct Canadian army within the British Empire, to be used in case of war. He wrote a letter to the Governor General, the Duke of Connaught, about his longtime demand for the Victoria Cross. Connaught privately recommended that Borden get rid of him. Chartrand described Hughes as an individual endowed with \\"great charm, wit, and driving energy, allied with consummate political skills\\", but on the negative side called him \\"a stubborn, pompous racist\\" and a \\"passionate Orange Order supremacist\\" who did little to disguise his dislike of Catholics in general and of French-Canadians in particular. Hughes's views later did much to put off French-Canadians and Irish-Canadians from supporting the war effort in World War I. Chartrand further wrote that Hughes was a megalomaniac with a grotesquely inflated sense of his own importance who \\"would admit no contradiction to his views\\". Hughes's own son, Garnet, wrote: \\"God help he who goes against my father's will\\". Minister of Militia and Defence Borden had \\"profound misgivings\\" about appointing Hughes to the cabinet, but as Hughes insisted on the defense portfolio, and Borden owed Hughes a political debt for his past loyalty, he received his wish to be appointed defense minister. This debt went back to Borden's days as the embattled Leader of the Official Opposition, when Hughes, then shadow defense minister, had been loyal to him at a time when many Conservative MPs wanted a new leader after Borden lost two general elections in a row in 1904 and 1908. Hughes was by then a colonel in the militia, and he insisted on wearing his uniform at all times, including cabinet meetings. In 1912, Hughes promoted himself to the rank of major- general. An energetic minister, Hughes traveled all over Canada in his private luxury railroad car to attend parades and manoeuvres by the militia. His penchant for colorful and flamboyant statements made him a media favorite, and journalists were always asking the defense minister for his opinions on any subject, secure in the knowledge that Hughes was likely to say something outrageous that would help to sell newspapers. Berton described Hughes as \\"...a staunch Britisher, but also a staunch Canadian nationalist, who was absolutely determined that Canada should not be a vassal of the mother country\\". Hughes saw the Dominions as equal partners of the United Kingdom in the management of the British empire, making claims for powers for Ottawa that anticipated the 1931 Statute of Westminster, and fiercely fought against attempts on the part of London to treat Canada in a mere colonial role. In December 1911, Hughes announced that he was going to increase the militia budget and built more camps and drill halls for the militia. From 1911 to 1914, the defense budget rose from $7 million to $11 million per year. Hughes was openly hostile to the Permanent Active Militia, or Permanent Force, as Canada's small professional army was known, and praised the Non-Permanent Active Militia (often shortened to just \\"Militia\\") as reflecting the authentic fighting spirit of Canada. Taking the view that citizen soldiers were better soldiers than the professionals, Hughes cut spending on the \\"bar room loafers\\" as he called the Permanent Force to increase the size of the Non-Permanent Active Militia. Critics charged that Hughes favored the Militia as it allowed him opportunities for patronage as he gave various friends and allies officers' commissions in the militia that did not exist with the Permanent Force, where promotion was based on merit. Hughes did not have much interest in the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), which had been founded by Laurier in 1910, in large part because the Navy by its very existence required a full-time force of professionals, which did not fit in well with the Defense Minister's enthusiasm for citizen-soldiers. Furthermore, the Navy was under the Department of Naval Services, which made it rival to the Defense Department in terms of military spending. But at the same time, Hughes was opposed to Borden's plans to disband the Navy and instead have Canada contribute some $35 million directly to the British Royal Navy, preferring that Canada have its own navy. During the naval debates in 1912, Hughes supported retaining the \\"tin-pot navy\\" as the RCN was often called and helped to ensure its continued existence. In April 1912, Hughes caused much controversy when he forbade militia regiments in Quebec from taking part in Catholic processions, a practice that went back to the days of New France, and had been tolerated under British rule and since 1867 under Confederation. Hughes justified the move as upholding secularism, but Quebec newspapers noted that Hughes was an Orangeman, and blamed his decision as due to the anti-Catholic prejudices one could expect from a member of the Loyal Orange Order. Hughes's practice of pushing out experienced Permanent Force officers serving on the general staff in favor of militia officers and his lavish spending were also the causes of controversy. Hughes used the Defense Department funds to give a free Ford Model T car to every militia colonel in Canada, a move which caused much criticism. In 1913, Hughes went on an all-expenses paid junket to Europe together with his family, his secretaries, and various militia colonels who were his friends and their families. Hughes justified the trip, which lasted several months, as necessary to observe military manoeuvres in Britain, France and Switzerland, but to many Canadians, it appeared more like an expensive vacation taken with the taxpayer's money. Hughes's intention was to make militia service compulsory for every able-bodied male, a plan that caused considerable public opposition. Chartrand wrote that Hughes's plan for compulsory militia service, based on the example of Switzerland, failed to take into account the differences between Switzerland, a highly conformist society in Central Europe vs. Canada, a more individualistic society in North America. The reasons Hughes gave for a larger Swiss-style militia were moral, not military. A strong believer in temperance, Hughes banned alcohol from militia camps and believed that compulsory militia was the best way of stamping out the consumption of alcohol in Canada. In a speech in Napanee in 1913, Hughes declared he wanted to : > \\"To make the youth of Canada self-controlled, erect, decent and patriotic > through military and physical training, instead of growing up to as under > present conditions of no control, into young ruffians or young gadabouts; to > ensure peace by national preparedness for war; to make military camps and > drill halls throughout Canada clean, wholesome, sober and attractive to boys > and young men; to give that final touch to imperial unity, and crown the > arch of responsible government by an inter-Imperial Parliament dealing only > with Imperial affairs\\". Hughes's campaign for compulsory militia service as a form of moral reformation to save the alleged wayward young men of Canada from lives of debauchery and licentiousness made him into one of the better known and most controversial ministers in the Borden government. Borden himself wanted to sack Hughes, whom he regarded as a political liability, by 1913 but was afraid of his bellicose defense minister to whom he also owned some major political debts. Borden was a gentlemanly and mild-mannered lawyer from Halifax who was intimidated by Hughes, a huge blustering and combative Orangeman overtly fond of getting into brawls, who wrote \\"long, vituperative letters\\" at the slightest criticism, claimed to be \\"loved by millions\\" of voters, and often compared himself to a train and his critics to dogs. Hughes himself often said that Borden was \\"gentle hearted as a girl\\". First World War In 1839, a treaty had been signed by Prussia and Britain guaranteeing the independence and neutrality of Belgium. On 2 August 1914, Imperial Germany, which had assumed Prussia's commitment to Belgian neutrality and independence in 1871, invaded Belgium as the German chancellor Dr. Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg dismissed the guarantee as a \\"mere scrap of paper\\". The question facing British leaders was whether the United Kingdom would honor the guarantee of Belgium by declaring war on Germany or not. On the morning of 3 August 1914, Hughes arrived at the Defense Department, visibly upset and angry, and according to those present cried out: \\"They are going to skunk it! They seem to be looking for an excuse to get out of helping France. Oh! What a shameful state of things! By God, I don't want to be a Britisher under such conditions!\\" When it was pointed out that the British cabinet had called an emergency meeting to discuss the invasion of Belgium, Hughes replied: \\"They are curs enough to do it; I can read between the lines. I believe they will temporize and hum and haw too long-and by God, I don't want to be a Britisher under such conditions-it is too humiliating\\". Hughes asked if the Union Jack was flying in front of the Defense Department, and upon being told it was, shouted: \\"Then send up and have it taken down! I will not have it over Canada's military headquarters, when Britain shirks her plain duty-it is disgraceful!\\" The Union Jack was pulled down, and only put up again the next day, when it was announced that Britain had sent an ultimatum demanding that Germany pull out of Belgium at once, and upon its rejection, Britain had honored the guarantee of Belgium by declaring war on Germany, shortly after midnight on 4 August 1914. As Canada was part of the British Empire, the Dominion was automatically at war. In a speech (in French) to the House of Commons, Laurier, who had become the leader of the Official Opposition after losing the 1911 election, stated: \\"When the call comes, our answer goes at once, and it goes in the classical language of the British answer to the call of duty, 'Ready, aye, ready'\\". Laurier's speech captured the mood of the nation in August 1914 and most Canadians wanted to aid the \\"mother country\\" as it faced its greatest challenge yet. On 7 August 1914, Borden announced to the House of Commons that the British government had just accepted his offer of an expeditionary force to Europe. In 1911, the General Staff under Major-General Sir Willoughby Gwatkin had drawn up a plan in the event of a war in Europe for mobilizing the militia that called for Canada to send an expeditionary force of one infantry division and an independent cavalry brigade together with artillery and support units from the Permanent Force that was to be assembled at Camp Petawawa outside of Ottawa. Much to everyone's surprise, Hughes disregarded the General Staff's plan and refused to mobilize the militia, instead creating a brand new organization called the Canadian Expeditionary Force (CEF) made up of numbered battalions that was separate from the militia. Instead of going to the existing Camp Petawawa, Hughes chose to build a new camp at Valcartier, outside of Quebec City, for the CEF. Hughes's sudden decision to not to call out the militia and create the CEF threw Canadian mobilization into complete chaos as a new bureaucracy had to be created at the same time that thousands of young men flocked for the colors. Morton wrote that in August‚ÄìSeptember 1914 \\"...a sweating, swearing, sublimely happy Hughes pulled some kind of order from the chaos he had created\\". In the process, Hughes managed to insult everyone from the Governor-General, the Duke of Connaught, to the French-Canadian community. When the president of the Toronto chapter of the Humane Society visited Hughes to express concern about the neglect and mistreatment of horses at Camp Valcartier, Hughes called him a liar and personally picked him up and tossed him out of his office. Likewise, when John Farthing, the Anglican bishop of Montreal, visited Hughes to complain about the shortage of Church of England chaplains at Valcartier to tend to the spiritual needs of Anglican volunteers, Hughes burst into a rage and began to loudly swear at Farthing, making liberal use of a number of four letter words not normally used to address an Anglican bishop, who was predictably shocked. Though Hughes worked hard at ensuring the construction of Camp Valcartier and trying to bring order to the chaos he caused by not calling out the militia, almost everyone who knew him was convinced he was in some way insane. The Duke of Connaught wrote in a report to London that Hughes was \\"off his base\\". A Conservative M.P from Toronto, Angus Claude Macdonell, told Borden \\"The man is insane\\", and that Canada needed a new defense minister at once. The deputy prime minister, Sir George Foster, wrote in his diary on 22 September 1914: \\"There is only one feeling about Sam. That he is crazy\\". The industrialist, Sir Joseph Flavelle, wrote that Hughes was \\"mentally unbalanced with the low cunning and cleverness often associated with the insane\\". Borden in his memoirs wrote about Hughes that his behavior was \\"so eccentric as to justify the conclusion that his mind was unbalanced\\". Hughes encouraged the recruitment of volunteers following the First World War's outbreak and ordered the construction of Camp Valcartier on August 7, 1914, demanding it to be finished by the time the entire force was assembled. With the aid of 400 workmen, Hughes saw the completion of the camp. Unfortunately the camp was poorly organized. With approximately 33,000 recruits, training became a chaotic process. There was little time to train the volunteers, so the training system was rushed. Another problem was that the camp's population was constantly growing, which made planning a difficult task. Hughes was infamous for belligerently giving orders to troops and their officers and he publicly criticized officers in front of their men, telling one officer who was speaking too quietly for his liking \\"Pipe up, you little bugger or get out of the service!\\". When Hughes addressed one officer as a captain, only to be told by the man that he was a lieutenant, Hughes promoted him on the spot to captain. When it was pointed out that he did not have that power as minister of defence, Hughes shouted \\"Sir, I know what I'm talking about!\\" and said if he wanted to promote the officer to a captain, then the officer was a captain. Hughes insisted on riding around the camp surrounded by an honor guard of lancers and shouting out orders for infantry manoeuvres long since removed from the training manuals like \\"Form square!\\"; when presented with such commands, the soldiers did their best to guess what it was he wanted them to do, though Hughes seemed well satisfied. Volunteer morale was challenged by inadequate tents, shortages of greatcoats and confusion regarding equipment and storage. However, Hughes received praise for the speed of his actions by Prime Minister Borden and members of the cabinet. All of the officers Hughes chose to command the brigades and battalions of the First Contingent were Anglo-Canadians. Fran√ßois-Louis Lessard, a Permanent Force officer with an outstanding record in the Boer War was denied by Hughes permission to join the First Contingent even through his record certainly merited such an appointment. Lessard was a Permanent Force man, a Catholic and a French- Canadian, and for all reasons, Hughes would not allow him to join the CEF. Recruitment of volunteers in Quebec might have yielded better results if Lessard had been given a command position. By October 1914, the troops were mobilized and ready to leave for England. As the First Contingent boarded their ships in Quebec City on 3 October 1914 to take them to Europe, Hughes sat astride his horse to deliver a speech that caused the men of the First Contingent to boo and jeer him. Borden wrote in his diary that Hughes's speech was \\"flamboyant and grandiloquent\\" and that \\"Everybody laughing at Sam's address\\". Despite Hughes's claims about the superiority of Canadians over British soldiers, two-thirds of the First Contingent were British immigrants to Canada. The majority of the 1,811 officers of the First Contingent were Canadian-born men who had previously held commissions in the Militia or Permanent Force. The Canadian historian Jack Granatstein wrote that an \\"extraordinary\\" 228,170 of the about 470,000 British male immigrants enlisted in the CEF during the war, making them easily the largest ethnic group in the CEF at 48.5%, and not until conscription was introduced in 1917 did the majority of the CEF finally become Canadian-born. Even in 1918, the Canadian- born soldiers consisted of 51.4% of the total serving, with the majority of the rest being British immigrants. Hughes left for London at the same time as the First Contingent did, as he heard correct reports that the British War Secretary, Lord Kitchener, was planning on breaking up the CEF when it arrived in Britain to assign its battalions to the British Army. As Hughes took an ocean liner he arrived in Southampton several days before the CEF's arrival, and upon his landing, he told the British press that if it was not for him that the convoy of 30 ships taking the CEF across the north Atlantic would have been torpedoed by U-boats, though just how Hughes had saved the 30 ships from U-boats was left unexplained. Hughes was determined that the CEF fight together and upon arriving in London, went dressed in his full ceremonial uniform as a major-general in the Canadian militia, to see Kitchener. Hughes clashed with Kitchener and insisted quite vehemently that the CEF not be broken up. In a telegram to Borden, Hughes wrote: \\"I determined that Canada was not be to treated as a Crown Colony and that, as we paid the bill and furnished the goods, which in nearly every instance were better than the British, I would act\\". Hughes won his bureaucratic battle with Kitchener and ensured the CEF stay together, mostly by arguing that since the Dominion was paying the entire costs of maintaining the CEF that the Dominion government should have the final say over its deployment. Berton wrote that ensuring the CEF stayed together was Hughes's greatest achievement as without his intervention in October 1914, what ultimately became the Canadian Corps of four divisions would never have existed. In the fall of 1914, Hughes created the Shell Committee to manufacture shells and bullets for both the Canadians and the British. By Christmas 1914, the Shell Committee had orders for 2 million shells and 1.9 million brass casings. As the CEF took up its training facilities on Salisbury Plain, Hughes wanted the 1st Canadian Division to be commanded by a Canadian general and only very reluctantly accepted a British officer, Lieutenant-General Sir Edwin Alderson, as the commander of the 1st Division when it turned out that there was no qualified Canadian officer. Hughes's insistence on supplying the CEF with Canadian-made equipment, regardless of its quality, made for difficult conditions for the men of the CEF, with many soldiers already complaining about the Ross rifle in training. Alderson replaced the Shield Shovels invented by Hughes's secretary, Ena McAdam, with the standard British Army shovel, much to the relief of the CEF and to Hughes's fury. Hughes constantly sought to undermine Alderson's command, regularly involving himself in divisional matters that were not the normal concern of a defense minister. The first Canadian unit to see action was Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry, a regiment privately raised by a wealthy Montreal industrialist, Hamilton Gault, which arrived on the Western Front in December 1914, separately from the First Contingent. On 16 February 1915, the CEF arrived in France to head for the front-lines, taking up position at the crucial Ypres Salient in Belgium. On 22 April 1915, at the Ypres salient, the German Army unleashed 160 tons of chlorine gas. From the German lines arose an ominous yellow cloud which floated across no-man's land to bring death and suffering to the Allied soldiers on the other side, killing 1,400 French and Algerian soldiers in the trenches, leaving another 2,000 blinded while the rest broke and fled in terror. Despite the dangers of the gas which blinded when it did not kill, the 1st Canadian Division stepped up to hold the line on the night of 22‚Äì23 April and prevented the Germans from marching through the 4-mile hole in the Allied lines created when the French and Algerians fled. On 23 April, the Germans unleashed the chlorine gas on the Canadian lines, leading to \\"desperate fighting\\" as the Canadians used improvised gas-masks of urine-soaked rags while complaining about the Ross rifles, which too often jammed up in combat. The Second Battle of Ypres was the first major battle for the Canadians, costing the 1st Division 6,035 men killed while the Princess Patricia's battalion lost 678 dead, and gave the CEF a reputation as a \\"tough force\\" that was to last for the rest of the war. The Canadians had held the line at Ypres in spite of appalling conditions and unlike the French and Algerians, the Canadians did not flee when faced with the cloud of gas. Hughes was ecstatic at the news that the Canadians had won their first battle, which in his own mind validated everything he had done as defense minister. At the same time, Hughes attacked Alderson for the losses at Ypres, claiming that a Canadian general would have done a better job and was furious when he learned that Alderson wanted to replace the Ross rifles with Lee-Enfield rifles. In a telegram to Max Aitken, the Canadian millionaire living in London whom Hughes had appointed as his representative in Britain, Hughes wrote: \\"It is the general opinion that scores of our officers can teach the British officers for many moons to come\\". In September 1915 the Second Contingent arrived on the Western Front in the form of the 2nd Canadian Division and the Canadian Corps was created. Alderson was appointed the corps commander while for first time, Canadians were given divisional command with Arthur Currie of Victoria taking command of the 1st Division and Richard Turner of Quebec City taking command of the 2nd Division. Hughes himself had wanted to take command of the Canadian Corps, but Borden had prevented this. In May 1915, Hughes first learned that Currie had embezzled some $10, 000 dollars from his militia regiment in Victoria in June 1914 and the police were recommending criminal charges be brought against him. One of Hughes's agents, Harold Daly, wrote after the war he had been ordered by the Defense Minister \\"to assure General Currie that his personal interests were being looked after and he was on no account to worry\\". In the spring of 1915, the Second Contingent had been raised and departed for training in England. Hughes was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath, on August 24, 1915. In 1916 he was made an honorary Lieutenant-General in the British Army. A Regimental and King's Colours display and plaque at Knox Presbyterian Church (Ottawa) is dedicated to the memory of those who served in the 207th (Ottawa- Carleton) Battalion, CEF during the First World War. The Regimental Colours were donated by the American Bank Note Company and presented by Hughes to the battalion on Parliament Hill on November 18, 1916. In spite of mounting criticism from 1915 onward at the way in which Hughes ran the Defense Department in wartime, the politically indebted Borden kept Hughes on.To Borden, events seemed to prove that many of Hughes's opinions were right, as the prime minister visited the Western Front in the summer of 1915 and became convinced that much of what Hughes had to say about the inefficiency of the British Army was correct. Hughes's methods were unorthodox and chaotic, but Hughes argued he was merely cutting through the red-tape to help \\"the boys\\" in the field. Finally, Borden in his dealings with British officials often found them patronising and condescending, which led him to side with his nationalist defense minister who argued that Canadians were the equals of the \\"mother country\\" in imperial affairs, and should not be talked down to. The same summer, it emerged that the Shell Committee had $170 million worth in orders to fulfill while it delivered only $5.5 million of its orders, with accusations being made that Hughes's friends were engaging in war profiting. With the support of Borden, the British Minister of Munitions, David Lloyd George stopped all orders until Canada created the Imperial Munitions Board headed by the industrialist Sir Joseph Flavelle. Flavelle ended the corruption and increased efficiency in the munitions industry, reaching the point that by 1917 Canadian factories were turning out some $2 million worth of shells per day. Hughes was enraged at the way that Flavelle had taken over an important function from his department, and even more that the Imperial Munitions Board was far more efficient and honest than the Defense Department had been. Despite the scandal caused by the Shell Committee, which led Borden to face very embarrassing questions in the House of Commons and to hopes on the part of Laurier that he might become prime minister again, Hughes was not sacked. Between October 1914-September 1915, 71 battalions had been raised for the CEF by the existing militia regiments, but the losses in the war required even more men. In August 1915, Hughes announced that any individual or group could form a \\"chum's battalion\\" (also known as a \\"pal's battalion\\") for the CEF, leading to the formation of various units such as Highland battalions for Scots-Canadians, Irish battalions for Irish-Canadians, \\"Sports\\" battalions based upon men interested in common sport like hockey, American battalions for American volunteers, Orange battalions for Orangemen, Bantam battalions for men shorter than 5'2, and so forth. The \\"pal's battalion\\" campaign was based upon the \\"chum's battalion\\" campaign launched in Britain in 1914. Though Hughes's \\"pal's battalions\\" campaign raised 170 new battalions by 1916, only 40 reached full strength, and many of the men who joined during the \\"pal's\\" campaign were underage, unfit or too old as recruiting colonels were more concerned about the quantity of volunteers as opposed to the quality. Of only those Canadians who saw combat in the war, 60% had joined by the end of 1915, and by the beginning of 1916 the number of volunteers fell off drastically with only 2,810 men volunteering between July 1916-October 1917. In March 1916, a 3rd Division was formed by amalgamating the Princess Patrica's Light Infantry; a Permanent Force regiment, the Royal Canadian Regiment, which previously guarded Bermuda against the unlikely threat of a German invasion; and various mounted rifle units that had been stationed in England since the spring of 1915. The 3rd Division first saw action on 1 June 1916 in the Battle of Mount Sorrel, which was lost to the Germans and then taken back by 13 June. In September 1916, the Canadian Corps entered the Battle of the Somme, fighting on until the end of the battle in November and in the process suffered 24,029 casualties. Out of the \\"chum's battalions\\" raised in 1915 was formed under the 4th Division, which first saw action on the Somme on 10 October 1916. The 4th Division was commanded by David Watson, the owner of the Quebec Chronicle newspaper who been personally chosen by Hughes, who thought highly of him. Hughes, an Orangeman prone to anti-Catholic sentiments and was not well liked among French Canadians, increased tensions by sending Anglocentrics to recruit French Canadians, and by forcing French volunteers to speak English in training. He reluctantly accepted Japanese-Canadians and Chinese-Canadians for the CEF and assigned black Canadians to construction units. However, some black Canadians did manage to enlist as infantrymen as Chartrand noted that in a painting by Eric Kennington of the 16th Canadian Scottish battalion marching through the ruins of a French village, one of the soldiers wearing kilts in the painting is a black man. In marked contrast to his attitudes towards black Canadian and Asian Canadian volunteers, Hughes encouraged the enlistment of First Nations volunteers into the CEF as it was believed that Indians would make for ferocious soldiers. The First Nations volunteers were generally assigned as snipers out of the belief that Indians were expert marksmen, and the most deadly sniper of the war with 378 kills was the Ojibwa Francis Pegahmagabow. Despite orders from the Governor-General not to, Hughes used Defense Department funds to buy newspaper ads in the neutral United States recruiting for the American Legion that he planned to form within the CEF. Borden was unaware until early 1916 that Hughes had recruited a battalion of American volunteers, which he first learned of after receiving American complaints about Canadian violations of American neutrality. Borden was even astonished to learn that an American Unitarian clergyman living in Toronto, the Reverend C.S. Bullock, whom Hughes had appointed his chief recruiter for the American Legion, had also received from Hughes a colonel's commission in the CEF despite having no military experience. Between 1914‚Äì1916, Hughes raised in total about half million volunteers for the CEF, of whom only about 13,000 were French-Canadians. Hughes's hostility towards French-Canada together with his decision not to call out the militia in 1914 contributed at least in part to the failure of recruiting in Quebec, despite the Defense Department spending $30,000 in Quebec in a campaign headed by Colonel Arthur Mignault in 1916 to recruit more volunteers. After the battle of Courcelette in 1916, two of the CEF's battalions from Quebec, the 163rd Poil-aux-pattes commanded by Olivar Asselin and the 189th, a group of hard- fighting Gasp√©siens who included two winners of the Victoria Cross, had to be broken up owing to a lack of replacements for their losses. The remaining men from the 163rd and 189th went into the 22nd Battalion, the future \\"Van Doos\\", whose men won more decorations for valor than any of the other battalions of the CEF by the end of the war. However, the failure of the recruiting efforts were also due to an attempt by the Ontario government in 1916 to ban schools for the French-Canadian minority in Ontario, which caused much resentment in Quebec, being seen as an attempt by the Orange Order, which was powerful in Ontario, to stamp out the French culture and language. Recruiting efforts in la belle province also failed due to Quebec's status as the most industrialised province as Montreal at the time was Canada's largest and most wealthiest city. During the war, munitions and textile plants in Montreal offered higher wages than anything the CEF could offer, and many French- Canadian men preferred to support the war effort by working in a factory in Montreal rather than enlisting in the CEF. Granatstein noted that French- Canadians made up 30% of Canada's population, but only 4% of the CEF, and that French-Canadians living outside of Quebec, as the Arcadians in New Brunswick, were more likely to enlist than those in Quebec. Over the course of the war, the policies carried out by the Ministry of Defense and Militia were much marked by much inefficiency and waste, largely caused by Hughes as Morton wrote: \\"Hughes's perennial contempt for military professionals, shared by his overseas agent, Max Aitken, became an excuse for chaos and influence-peddling in militia administration\\". As scandals continued from the exposure of wasteful purchasing in 1915 to the \\"munitions scandal\\" of 1916 which exposed Hughes's flunky J. Wesley Allison as corrupt, Borden took away various functions from Defense Ministry to be handled by an independent board or commission headed by men who were not cronies of Hughes. Hughes was widely resented and disliked by the men of the CEF and when Hughes visited Camp Borden in July 1916, \\"his boys\\" loudly booed him, blaming the minister for the shortages of water at Camp Borden. Hughes visiting the Front in August 1916 Hughes's policy of raising new battalions instead of sending the reinforcements to the existing battalions led to much administrative waste and ultimately led to most of the new battalions being broken up to provide manpower for the older battalions. To manage the Canadian Expeditionary Force in London, Hughes created a confusing system of overlapping authorities run by three senior officers, in order to make himself the ultimate arbiter of every issue. The most important of the officers in England was Major General John Wallace Carson, a mining magnate from Montreal and a friend of Hughes, who proved himself a skillful intriguer. While the officers in London feuded for Hughes's favor, what Morton called a \\"...burgeoning, wasteful, array of camps, offices, depots, hospitals and commands spread out across England\\". Twice, Borden sent Hughes to England to impose order and efficiency, and twice the prime minister was gravely disappointed. In September 1916, Hughes acting on his own and without informing Borden, announced in London the formation of the \\"Acting Overseas Sub-Militia Council\\" to be chaired by Carson with Hughes's son-in-law to serve as the chief secretary. His historical reputation was sullied further by poor decisions on procurements for the force. Insisting on the utilization of Canadian manufactured equipment, Hughes presided over the deployment of equipment that was often inappropriate for the Western Front, or of dubious quality. Previous to 1917, this negatively affected the operational performance of the CEF. The Ross Rifle, MacAdam Shield Shovel, boots and webbing (developed for use in the South African War), and the Colt machine gun were all Canadian items which were eventually replaced or abandoned due to quality or severe functionality issues. The management of spending for supplies was eventually taken away from Hughes and assigned to the newly formed War Purchasing Commission in 1915. It was not until Hughes' resignation in November 1916 that the Ross Rifle was fully abandoned by the CEF in favour of the British standard Lee‚ÄìEnfield rifle. Canadian staff officers possessed an extremely limited level of experience and competence at the start of the war, having been discouraged from passing through the British Staff College for many years prior. Compounding the issue was Hughes' regular attempts to promote and appoint officers based upon patronage and Canadian nativism instead of ability, an act which not only created tension and jealousy between units but ultimately negatively affected the operating performance of the CEF as well. Lieutenant General Byng, who replaced Alderson as commander of the CEF from May 1916, eventually became so incensed with the continuous interference on the part of Hughes that he threatened to resign. Byng, an aristocrat and a career British Army officer who was modest in his tastes and known for his care for his men, was very popular with the rank and file of the Canadian Corps, who called themselves \\"the Byng boys\\". This in turn sparked Hughes's jealousy. On 17 August 1916, Byng and Hughes had dinner where Hughes announced in his typical bombastic way that he never made a mistake and would hold the power of promotion within the Canadian Corps; Byng in reply stated that as a corps commander he had the power of promotion, that he would inform Hughes before any making promotions as a courtesy, and would resign if Hughes continued his interference with his command in the same way he had with Alderson. When Hughes claimed \\"I am never wrong\\", Byng replied \\"What a damn dull life you must have had, Minister!\\" Byng wanted to give command of the 2nd Division to Henry Burstall, who had greatly distinguished himself, over the objections of Hughes, who wanted to give command of the 2nd Division to his son Garnet, whom Byng regarded as a mediocrity unfit to command anything. Byng diplomatically told Hughes he had not appointed his son because the \\"Canadians deserved and expected the best leaders available\\". Byng wrote to Borden to say that he would not tolerate political interference in his corps, and he would resign if the younger Hughes was given the command of the 2nd Division rather than Burstall, who did indeed receive the appointment. Criticism from Field Marshal Douglas Haig, King George V and from within his own party gradually forced Canadian Prime Minister Sir Robert Borden to tighten control over Hughes. The Toronto Globe in an editorial on 22 June 1916 attacked Hughes for his \\"swashbuckling\\" speeches that were damaging relations with Britain. Borden, becoming assertive as the war continued on, began to tire of Hughes's tirades before the cabinet, and hinted more than once he was thinking about sacking him. However, it was not until Hughes' political isolation, with the creation of the Ministry of the Overseas Military Forces of Canada, overseen by George Halsey Perley, and subsequent forced resignation in November 1916, that the CEF was able to concentrate on the task of the spring offensive without persistent staffing interference. The creation of the Ministry of Overseas Military Forces to run the CEF was a major reduction in Hughes's power, causing him to rage and threaten Borden. After Hughes sent Borden an extremely insulting letter on 1 November 1916, the prime minister vacillated for the next 9 days before making his decision. Borden's patience with Hughes finally broke and he dismissed him from the cabinet on 9 November 1916. In his letter dismissing him, Borden stated that he was fired because of his \\"strong tendency to assume powers which [he did] not possess\\", and because the prime minister no longer had the \\"time or energy\\" to keeping solving all of the problems he had created. Sir Sam Hughes inspects 207th battalion and Presents Colours, 18 November 1916. Hughes later claimed in Who's Who to have served \\"in France, 1914-15\\" despite not being released from his ministry and not having been given any command in the field. His presence at the Western Front was limited to his visits to troops. On the margins Hughes's firing from the cabinet was greeted with relief by the rest of cabinet with the deputy prime minister Forster writing in his diary \\"the nightmare is removed\\". In the CEF, both the officers and the other ranks also generally welcomed his sacking. An embittered Hughes set out to embarrass Borden in the House of Commons by making accusations that Borden was mismanaging the war effort, though Hughes's determination to not appear unpatriotic imposed some limits on his willingness to attack the government. In his first speech to the Commons after his sacking on 20 January 1917, Hughes accused the finance minister, Sir William Thomas White, of running up the national debt irresponsibly, and his successor Albert Edward Kemp of mismanaging the defense ministry. By this time, Borden, whom many dismissed as a milquetoast at the beginning of the war, had shown himself to be tougher leader than many had expected, and for a great many people in English Canada, it was Borden rather than Hughes who emerged as the symbol of the national will to victory by 1917. With the financial support of his millionaire friend Aitken, who was now ennobled as Lord Beaverbrook, Hughes planned to start a third party, the War Party, which would allow him to become Prime Minister. The plan called for Beaverbrook and another right-wing millionaire \\"press baron\\" Lord Rothermere to buy up most of the newspapers in English Canada to build support for the War Party. However, the plan collapsed when Rothermere showed no interest in the project, and Beaverbrook refused to move unless Rothermere joined the project. After Hughes's sacking, many of his friends abandoned him, and Beaverbrook was one of the few who remained close to him, though the fact that Beaverbrook was living in London meant he rarely saw him in person. In January 1917, Hughes floated another plan for Beaverbrook to use his influence with David Lloyd George, by then British Prime Minister to have him in turn use his influence with King George V to have him appointed to the Privy Council in London. Lloyd George consulted with Borden, who emphatically stated that the king should be not advised to give Hughes a seat on the Privy Council. As such, Lloyd George told Beaverbrook that Hughes could best serve the war effort by remaining a backbench Conservative MP in Canada. At the same time, Hughes remained frustrated that Garnet Hughes was only commanding the 5th Canadian Division in England, which was used for training men sent to the four front line divisions of the Canadian Corps. When Currie replaced Byng as the commander of the Canadian Corps, Hughes wrote to him, saying it was time for his son to command the 1st Division. When Currie kept the younger Hughes in command of the 5th Division, Hughes turned on him. As Currie had embezzled money from his militia regiment in June 1914, and was only being saved from criminal charges in 1915 when Hughes intervened on his behalf, the latter accused the former of ingratitude. By 1917, Hughes had become extremely paranoid, writing in a letter to his son Garnet, that his mail was being \\"tampered with...and they even had detectives on prominent friends of mine\\". In the same letter, Hughes called the war effort \\"hell on earth\\" without him to lead it, and labelled Borden a \\"weakling\\". The Canadian historian Tim Cook wrote by 1917 Hughes was losing his mind as he \\"appeared to be suffering from some form of nascent dementia\\". Borden decided to break his promise against conscription because of mounting casualties, he proposed in May 1917 a coalition Union government that would bring together the Conservatives and the Liberals. Laurier refused, but many English Canadian Liberal MPs crossed the floor to join the Union government. Hughes was against the idea of the Union government, saying at a Tory caucus meeting that a Union government would \\"forever wipe out\\" the Conservative Party. Hughes saw a coalition government as being a hostile takeover of the Conservative Party by the Liberals. In the Conscription crisis of 1917, Hughes attacked Borden at first for bringing in conscription, claiming that enough volunteers to keep the Canadian Corps fighting would have been found had he continued as Defense Minister, but he changed his mind after receiving pro-conscription letters from his constituents in Victoria County. In the 1917 election Hughes did not run at first as a Union candidate, instead running as a Conservative, and his main challenger was a Union candidate endorsed by Borden. Three weeks before the election, Hughes finally declared his support for the Union government, which led the Unionist candidate to drop out in favor of Hughes. In the 1917 election, Hughes was returned with his greatest margin of victory ever. Hughes during his time as Defense Minister had used funds from the Dominion government to bring about a number of municipal improvements in Lindsay, increasing his popularity in Victoria County. One visitor from Toronto asked a local farmer what county he was in, and received the reply \\"This is Sam Hughes's country!\\" After Currie won the Battles of Hill 70, Lens and finally Passchendaele in November 1917, Hughes requested a meeting in January 1918 with Borden to discuss \\"Lens and somewhat similar massacres\\". When Borden refused, Hughes accused Currie in another letter to Borden of \\"massacres\\" of \\"my boys\\" due to \\"bullheadness and incompetency\\". At least part of the motive for the attack on Currie was the failure of the War Party, which led Hughes to make it his life mission to \\"expose the whole rotten show overseas\\" to ruin the reputation of Borden. In a letter to Lord Beaverbrook, Hughes wrote: \\"Currie was a coward at St. Julien and a damned fool ever since. He was the cause of practically having murdered thousands of men at Lens and Paschendaele [Passchendaele], and it is generally supposed the motive was to prevent the possibility of Turner coming back with the Second Army Corps, and to prevent Garnet from commanding a Division.\\" Cook described this letter as the most malicious of all Hughes's accusations against Currie as he was claiming that Currie had deliberately caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Canadians to force the government to send reinforcements to the Canadian Corps, and thereby prevent the creation of a second corps to be commanded by Turner, who had been dismissed from active command in 1916. Ignoring the existence of the Imperial War Cabinet, Hughes in a speech in Toronto claimed: \\"A Dominion which sends to an European war an army immeasurably greater than the Allied armies sent to the Crimea cannot again have the issue of peace and war determined for her by a government in which she is not represented\\". In another speech at a Masonic Lodge in Toronto on 9 January 1918, he demanded that all males in the age group 10-16 undergo militia training. In spite of concerns about possible riots, Hughes traveled to Montreal to give a speech attacking Borden for not conscripting what he claimed were 700,000 young men all across Canada. His speeches attacking Borden in Toronto and Montreal were well received by his audiences. On 6 May 1918, Hughes in a speech before the Commons denounced the Ministry of Overseas Forces for an excessive number of bureaucrats, and for the first time indirectly attacked Currie as he spoke of officers with a \\"reckless disregard for life\\". In October 1918, Hughes had written Borden a letter accusing Currie of \\"useless massacres of our Canadian boys, as needlessly occurred at Cambrai\\". Borden ignored Hughes's request that Currie and his \\"Black-hand Gang\\" be sacked. The news of the Armistice on 11 November 1918 was ill- received by Hughes, who felt that Currie had stolen the glory of victory was rightfully his. In December 1918, Currie learned from friends in Canada that Hughes was telling anybody who would listen that he was \\"a murderer, a coward, a drunkard and almost everything else that is bad and vile\\". In a letter to his sister, Currie wrote \\"Sam Hughes is a vindictive and bitterly disappointed man, and so is his son Garnet\\". On 4 March 1919, in a speech before the Commons, Hughes accused Currie of \\"needlessly sacrificing the lives of Canadian soldiers\\". As part of his speech, Hughes read out several of his 1918 letters to Borden, which was thereby entered in Hansard (allowing the press to quote from them), and thus incriminated Borden in his accusations against Currie. In particular, Hughes made much of the Second Battle of Mons in November 1918, claiming that Currie had only attacked Mons to have the Canadian Corps end the war for the British Empire where it began (the British Expeditionary Force fought its first battle at Mons in August 1914). Hughes always attacked Currie in speeches in the Commons, where criminal and civil law did not apply, ensuring he did not need fear a libel suit or a criminal charges for selectively quoting from official documents that were still classified as secret. Hughes's controversial speech attracted much attention. Hughes's speech accusing Currie of \\"murder\\" left most Canadians at the time \\"stunned\\". On 5 March 1919, The Toronto Daily Star published as a lead story on the front page a defense of Currie's leadership at the Second Battle of Cambrai, noting that Currie had the infantry supported by tanks encircle Cambrai, instead of the \\"mad frontal assault\\" claimed by Hughes. The Toronto Globe in an editorial on 6 March wrote: \\"The terrors of the war have been great and manifold for our gallant men in France, but Sir Sam Hughes is a greater terror than any of them. The enemy never dealt a fouler blow than that directed by Sir Sam Hughes against the leaders of the Canadian Army still in the field and unable to defend themselves\\". Cook noted the strangest aspect of the Hughes-Currie affair was that Hughes did not reveal that Currie was an embezzler, something that greatly worried Currie at the time. Hughes may have restrained himself as the fact he prevented criminal charges from being laid against Currie in 1915 would have left himself open to charges of obstruction of justice and abuse of his powers as defense minister. In his last two years of his life, Hughes believed that it was Currie, whom he was relentless in attacking, as the man behind what he regarded as the plots against him. In a letter to Garnet in May 1919, he wrote: \\"I have the fullest evidence now that upwards of nine months or more ago, instructions have been issued in a propaganda form to certain writers and correspondents, 'On every occasion, Sir Sam must be overshadowed by others'. And in several instances I have the definite instructions, 'Under any and every circumstances Sir Sam must be completely overshadowed by Sir Arthur Curry [Currie]'\\" In September 1919, Hughes in a speech to the Commons accused Currie of cowardice at the Second Battle of Ypres, claiming he fled in abject terror from his command post when he saw the yellow cloud of chlorine gas floating across no-man's land. On 16 June 1920, Hughes in another speech before the House said that Currie's military reputation was \\"propaganda\\" and there were dozens of officers who \\"are regarded throughout the length and breadth of this country as infinitely superior to General Sir Arthur Currie as a general or as a gentleman\\". Currie never responded publicly to these attacks, out of the fear that Hughes might reveal that he had stolen $10,000 dollars from his regiment in Victoria, but he was greatly wounded and hurt. Death In the summer of 1921, Hughes was informed by his doctors that he had only weeks to live. He returned to his home in the forests of Victoria County, which had been built to resemble a luxurious hunting lodge. On his deathbed, a Methodist minister came to offer solace, only to be told by the ever combative Hughes: \\"Don't you bother about me. Pretty soon I'll be sitting on the right hand of God and I'l be able to arrange things all right enough\\". Sam Hughes died of pernicious anaemia, aged sixty-eight, in August 1921 and was survived by his son, Garnet Hughes, who served in the First World War, and his grandson, Samuel Hughes, who was a field historian in the Second World War and later a judge. On 26 August 1921, his funeral in Lindsay became the largest ever in the town being attended by 20,000 people. To honor \\"Lindsay's foremost citizen\\", his coffin was carried by six veterans down the main street of Lindsay together with 45th Victoria Regiment, who marched to the somber tunes of drums and bagpipes. At the Riverside Cemetery, Hughes's coffin was placed into the earth while a bugler played The Last Post and artillery guns fired 15 salutes. He and his wife are buried together. Plaque A memorial plaque dedicated to the memory of Sam Hughes was erected in front of the Armouries building in Lindsay, Ontario. It reads: > Soldier, journalist, imperialist and Member of Parliament for Lindsay, > Ontario from 1892 to 1921, Sam Hughes helped to create a distinctively > Canadian Army. As Minister of Militia and Defence (1911‚Äì1916) he raised the > Canadian Expeditionary Force which fought in World War I, and was knighted > for his services. Disagreements with his colleagues and subordinates forced > his retirement from the Cabinet in 1916.\\"  Archives  There is a Sir Sam Hughes and Family collection at Library and Archives Canada.

There was a sustained campaign of civil resistance against regime violence and electoral fraud. The nonviolent revolution led to the departure of Ferdinand Marcos, the end of his 20-year presidential term and the restoration of democracy in the Philippines. It is also referred to as the Yellow Revolution due to the presence of yellow ribbons during demonstrations (in reference to the Tony Orlando and Dawn song \\"Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree\\") following the assassination of Filipino senator Benigno \\"Ninoy\\" Aquino, Jr. in August 1983 upon his return to the Philippines from exile. It was widely seen as a victory of the people against two decades of presidential rule by President Marcos, and made news headlines as \\"the revolution that surprised the world\\".. The majority of the demonstrations took place on a long stretch of Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, more commonly known by its acronym EDSA, in Metro Manila from February 22‚Äì25, 1986. They involved over two million Filipino civilians, as well as several political and military groups, and religious groups led by Cardinal Jaime Sin, the Archbishop of Manila, along with Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines President Cardinal Ricardo Vidal, the Archbishop of Cebu. The protests, fueled by the resistance and opposition from years of governance by President Marcos and his cronies, culminated with the absolute ruler and his family fleeing Malaca√±ang Palace to exile in Hawaii. Ninoy Aquino's widow, Corazon Aquino, was immediately installed as the eleventh President as a result of the revolution. Though sometimes described as a peaceful revolution, the People Power Revolution coincided with more militant and violent revolutionary movements that had formed during the Marcos dictatorship, namely the communist CPP‚ÄìNPA‚ÄìNDF rebellion and the Muslim independence movement of the Moro National Liberation Front. Background and history President Ferdinand Marcos served for 20 years, the longest tenure in Philippine history. President Ferdinand E. Marcos was elected president in 1965, defeating incumbent President Diosdado Macapagal by a margin of 52 to 43 percent. During this time, Marcos was very active in the initiation of public works projects and the intensification of tax collections. Marcos and his government claimed that they \\"built more roads than all his predecessors combined and more schools than any previous administration\\". Amidst charges from the opposition party of vote-buying and a fraudulent election, President Marcos was reelected in the 1969 Philippine presidential election, this time defeating Sergio Osme√±a, Jr. by 61 to 39 percent. President Marcos' second term for the presidency was marred by allegations by the opposition Liberal Party of widespread graft and corruption. According to leftists who rioted during the First Quarter Storm, the increasing disparity of wealth between the very wealthy and the very poor that made up the majority of the Philippines' population led to a rise in crime and civil unrest around the country. In March 1969, the NPA was formed as the military wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines, initiating the still-ongoing CPP‚ÄìNPA‚ÄìNDF rebellion. Marcos quickly denounced the movement, hoping to gain monetary and political support from anti-Communist administrators in the United States. In 1972 the Moro National Liberation Front, a militant Muslim separatist group, formed in the southern island of Mindanao. Marcos soon used the rise of militant and civil unrest as justification for declaring martial law. = Proclamation of Martial Law = Barred from running for a third term as president in 1973, Marcos announced Proclamation No. 1081 on September 23, 1972, declaring martial law with rising civil disobedience as a justification. Through this decree and after obtaining voters consent through the plebiscite, President Marcos seized emergency powers giving him full control of the Philippines' military and the authority to suppress and abolish the freedom of speech, the freedom of the press, and many other civil liberties. President Marcos also dissolved the Philippine Congress and shut down media establishments critical of the Marcos Administration. President Marcos also ordered the immediate arrest of his political opponents and critics. Among those arrested were Senate President Jovito Salonga, Senator Jose Diokno, and Senator Benigno Aquino Jr., whom Marcos linked with the Communists and the man who was groomed by the opposition to succeed President Marcos after the 1973 elections. On November 25, 1977, the Military Commission charged Aquino along with his two co- accused, NPA leaders Bernabe Buscayno (Commander Dante) and Lt. Victor Corpuz, guilty of all charges and sentenced them to death by firing squad. A constitutional convention, which had been called for in 1970 to replace the Commonwealth-era 1935 Constitution, continued the work of framing a new constitution after the declaration of martial law. The new constitution went into effect in early 1973, changing the form of government from presidential to parliamentary and allowing President Marcos to stay in power beyond 1973. The constitution was approved by 95% of the voters in the Philippine constitutional plebiscite. In 1978, while still in prison, Aquino founded his political party, Lakas ng Bayan (abbreviated \\"LABAN\\"; English: People's Power) to run for office in the Interim Batasang Pambansa (Parliament). All LABAN candidates lost, including Ninoy himself. With practically all of his political opponents were arrested and in exile, President Marcos' pre-emptive declaration of martial law in 1972 and the ratification of his new constitution by more than 95% of voters enabled Marcos to effectively legitimize his government and hold on to power for another 14 years beyond his first two terms as president. In a Cold War context, Marcos retained the support of the United States through Marcos' promise to stamp out communism in the Philippines and by assuring the United States of its continued use of military and naval bases in the Philippines. = 1980s economic collapse = Because the Marcos administration's spending had relied so heavily on debt since Marcos' first term in the 60s, the Philippines was left vulnerable when the US economy went into recession in the third quarter of 1981, forcing the Reagan administration to increase interest rates. The Philippine economy began going into decline in 1981, continuing to do so by the time the Benigno Aquino Jr. assassination in 1983. The economic and political instability combined to produce the worst recession in Philippine history in 1984 and 1985, with the economy contracting by 7.3% for two successive years. =Assassination of Ninoy Aquino= Despite warnings from the military and First Lady Imelda R. Marcos, Ninoy Aquino was determined to return to the Philippines. Asked what he thought of the death threats, Ninoy Aquino responded, \\"The Filipino is worth dying for.\\" At that time, Ninoy's passport had expired and the renewal had been denied. Ninoy, therefore, acquired a plan to acquire a fake passport with the help of Rashid Lucman, The passport carried the alias Marcial Bonifacio (Marcial for martial law and Bonifacio for Fort Bonifacio, his erstwhile prison). On August 21, 1983, after a three-year exile in the United States, Aquino was assassinated by Rolando Galman as he disembarked from a Taiwanese commercial flight at the Manila International Airport (which was later renamed in Aquino's honor).. His assassination shocked and outraged many Filipinos, most of whom had lost confidence in the Marcos administration. The event led to more suspicions about the government, triggering non-cooperation among Filipinos that eventually led to outright civil disobedience. It also shook the Marcos Administration, which was by then deteriorating due in part to Marcos' worsening health and ultimately fatal illness (lupus erythematosus). The assassination of Ninoy Aquino caused the Philippines economy to deteriorate even further, and the government plunged further into debt. By the end of 1983, the Philippines was in an economic recession, with the economy contracting by 6.8%. In 1984, Marcos appointed a commission, led by Chief Justice Enrique Fernando, to launch an investigation into Aquino's assassination. Despite the commission's conclusions, Cardinal Jaime Sin, the Archbishop of Manila, declined an offer to join the commission and rejected the government's views on the assassination. =Calls for election= On November 3, 1985, after pressure from the US government, Marcos suddenly announced that a snap presidential election would take place the following year, one year ahead of the regular presidential election schedule, to legitimize his control over the country. The snap election was legalized with the passage of Batas Pambansa Blg. 883 (National Law No. 883) by the Marcos- controlled unicameral congress called the Regular Batasang Pambansa. The growing opposition movement encouraged Ninoy Aquino's widow, Corazon Aquino, to run for the presidency. United Opposition (UNIDO) leader, Salvador Laurel, who earlier filed his candidacy as an official UNIDO candidate for the presidency, gave way to Cory after a political deal which was later reneged by Cory after the election. Salvador Laurel eventually ran as Cory Aquino's running mate for vice-president under the United Opposition (UNIDO) party. Marcos ran for re-election, with Arturo Tolentino as his running mate under the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan (KBL) party. =1986 election= The election was held on February 7, 1986. The official election canvasser, the Commission on Elections (COMELEC), declared that Marcos was the winner. The final tally of the COMELEC had Marcos winning with 10,807,197 votes against Aquino's 9,291,761 votes. On the other hand, based on returns of 70% of the precincts of the National Movement for Free Elections (NAMFREL), an accredited poll watcher, had Aquino winning with 7,835,070 votes against Marcos' 7,053,068 votes.; ^ (showing a reproduction of NAMFREL's announcement of the results). This electoral exercise was marred by widespread reports of violence and tampering of election results, culminating in the walkout of 30 COMELEC computer technicians to protest the deliberate manipulation of the official election results to favor Ferdinand Marcos. The walkout was considered as one of the early \\"sparks\\" of the People Power Revolution. The walkout also served as an affirmation to allegations of vote-buying, fraud, and tampering of election results by the KBL. Because of reports of alleged fraud, the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP) through Cardinal Ricardo Vidal issued a statement condemning the elections. The United States Senate also passed a resolution stating the same condemnation. US president Ronald Reagan issued a statement calling the fraud reports as \\"disturbing\\" but he said that there was fraud \\"on both sides\\" of the Philippine election. In response to the protests, COMELEC claimed that Marcos with 53 percent won over Aquino. However, NAMFREL countered that the latter won over Marcos with 52 percent of votes.. On February 15, Marcos was proclaimed by COMELEC and Batasang Pambansa as the winner amidst the controversy. All 50 opposition members of the Parliament walked out in protest. The Filipino people repudiated the results, asserting that Aquino was the real victor. Both \\"winners\\" took their oath of office in two different places, with Aquino gaining greater mass support. Aquino also called for coordinated strikes and mass boycott of the media and businesses owned by Marcos' cronies. As a result, the crony banks, corporations, and media were hit hard, and their shares in the stock market plummeted to record levels. =Vidal's declaration= Cardinal Vidal, after the result of the snap election, issued a declaration in lieu of the Philippine Church hierarchy stating that when \\"a government does not of itself freely correct the evil it has inflicted on the people then it is our serious moral obligation as a people to make it do so.\\" The declaration also asked \\"every loyal member of the Church, every community of the faithful, to form their judgment about the February 7 polls\\" and told all the Filipinos, \\"Now is the time to speak up. Now is the time to repair the wrong. The wrong was systematically organized. So must its correction be. But as in the election itself, that depends fully on the people; on what they are willing and ready to do.\\" Events =Aborted military coup= Appalled by the bold and apparent election irregularities, the Reform the Armed Forces Movement set into motion a coup attempt against Marcos. The initial plan was for a team to assault Malaca√±an Palace and arrest Ferdinand Marcos. Other military units would take over key strategic facilities, such as the airport, military bases, the GHQAFP in Camp Aguinaldo, and major highway junctions to restrict counteroffensive by Marcos- loyal troops. However, after Marcos learned about the plot, he ordered their leaders' arrest,. and presented to the international and local press some of the captured plotters, Maj. Saulito Aromin and Maj. Edgardo Doromal. Threatened with their impending imprisonment, Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and his fellow coup plotters decided to ask for help from then-AFP Vice Chief of Staff Lt. Gen Fidel Ramos, who was also the chief of the Philippine Constabulary (now the Philippine National Police). Ramos agreed to resign from his position and support the plotters. Enrile also contacted the highly influential Cardinal Archbishop of Manila Jaime Sin for his support. At about 6:30 p.m. on February 22, Enrile and Ramos held a press conference at the Ministry of National Defense building in Camp Aguinaldo, where they announced that they had resigned from their positions in Marcos' cabinet and were withdrawing support from his government. Marcos himself later conducted a news conference calling on Enrile and Ramos to surrender, urging them to \\"stop this stupidity\\". =Sin's appeal= After Cardinal Vidal's condemnation of the snap election's fraudulent result, a message was aired over Radio Veritas at around 9 p.m., Cardinal Sin exhorted Filipinos in the capital to aid rebel leaders by going to the section of EDSA between Camp Crame and Aguinaldo and giving emotional support, food and other supplies. For many, this seemed an unwise decision since civilians would not stand a chance against a dispersal by government troops. Many people, especially priests and nuns, still trooped to EDSA. Radio Veritas played a critical role during the mass uprising. Former University of the Philippines president Francisco Nemenzo stated that: \\"Without Radio Veritas, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to mobilize millions of people in a matter of hours.\\" Similarly, a certain account in the event said that: \\"Radio Veritas, in fact, was our umbilical cord to whatever else was going on.\\" =Rising mass support= At dawn, Sunday, government troops arrived to knock down the main transmitter of Radio Veritas, cutting off broadcasts to people in the provinces. The station switched to a standby transmitter with a limited range of broadcast. The station was targeted because it had proven to be a valuable communications tool for the people supporting the rebels, keeping them informed of government troop movements and relaying requests for food, medicine, and supplies. Still, people came to EDSA until it swelled to hundreds of thousands of unarmed civilians. The mood in the street was very festive, with many bringing whole families. Performers entertained the crowds, nuns and priests led prayer vigils, and people set up barricades and makeshift sandbags, trees, and vehicles in several places along EDSA and intersecting streets such as Santolan and Ortigas Avenue. Everywhere, people listened to Radio Veritas on their radios. Several groups sang Bayan Ko (My Homeland),. which, since 1980, had become a patriotic anthem of the opposition. People frequently flashed the 'LABAN' sign,. which is an \\"L\\" formed with their thumb and index finger. 'laban' is the Filipino word for 'fight', but also the abbreviation of Lakas ng Bayan, Ninoy Aquino's party. After lunch on February 23, Enrile and Ramos decided to consolidate their positions. Enrile crossed EDSA from Camp Aguinaldo to Camp Crame amidst cheers from the crowd. In the mid-afternoon, Radio Veritas relayed reports of Marines massing near the camps in the east and LVT-5 tanks approaching from the north and south. A contingent of Marines with tanks and armored vans, led by Brigadier General Artemio Tadiar, was stopped along Ortigas Avenue, about two kilometers from the camps, by tens of thousands of people.. Nuns holding rosaries knelt in front of the tanks and men and women linked arms together to block the troops.. Tadiar asked the crowds to make a clearing for them, but they did not budge. In the end, the troops retreated with no shots fired. By evening, the standby transmitter of Radio Veritas failed. Shortly after midnight, the staff was able to go to another station to begin broadcasting from a secret location under the moniker \\"Radyo Bandido\\" (Outlaw Radio, which is now known as DZRJ-AM). June Keithley, with her husband Angelo Castro, Jr., was the radio broadcaster who continued Radio Veritas' program throughout the night and in the remaining days. =More military defections= At dawn on Monday, February 24, the first serious encounter with government troops occurred. Marines marching from Libis, in the east, lobbed tear gas at the demonstrators, who quickly dispersed. Some 3,000 Marines then entered and held the east side of Camp Aguinaldo. Later, helicopters manned by the 15th Strike Wing of the Philippine Air Force, led by Colonel Antonio Sotelo, were ordered from Sangley Point in Cavite (South of Manila) to head to Camp Crame.. Secretly, the squadron had already defected and instead of attacking Camp Crame, landed in it, with the crowds cheering and hugging the pilots and crew members. A Bell 214 helicopter piloted by Major Deo Cruz of the 205th Helicopter Wing and Sikorsky S-76 gunships piloted by Colonel Charles Hotchkiss of the 20th Air Commando Squadron joined the rebel squadron earlier in the air. The presence of the helicopters boosted the morale of Enrile and Ramos who had been continually encouraging their fellow soldiers to join the opposition movement. In the afternoon, Aquino arrived at the base where Enrile, Ramos, RAM officers and a throng were waiting. =The capture of MBS-4= At around that time, June Keithley received reports that Marcos had left Malaca√±ang Palace and broadcast this to the people at EDSA. The crowd celebrated and even Ramos and Enrile came out from Crame to appear to the crowds. The jubilation was however short-lived as Marcos later appeared on television on the government-controlled MBS-4,. (using the foreclosed ABS- CBN facilities, transmitter, and compound in Broadcast Plaza) declaring that he would not step down. It was thereafter speculated that the false report was a calculated move against Marcos to encourage more defections. During this broadcast, MBS-4 suddenly went off the air. A contingent of rebels, under Colonel Mariano Santiago, had captured the station. MBS-4 was put back on the air shortly after noon, with Orly Punzalan announcing on live television, \\"Channel 4 is on the air again to serve the people.\\" By this time, the crowds at EDSA had swollen to over a million. (Some estimates placed them at two million.) This broadcast was considered the \\"return\\" of ABS-CBN on air because this was the time when former employees of the network were inside the complex after 14 years of closure since Marcos took it over during the Martial Law of 1972. \\"Radyo Bandido\\" ended broadcasting that afternoon, while Radio Veritas resumed transmissions, this time from the Broadcast Plaza's radio studios. In the late afternoon, rebel helicopters attacked Villamor Airbase, destroying presidential air assets. Another helicopter went to Malaca√±ang, fired a rocket, and caused minor damage. Later, most of the officers who had graduated from the Philippine Military Academy (PMA) defected. The majority of the Armed Forces had already changed sides. =Marcos orders not to shoot= Prior dialogues to stop the revolution had not succeeded with the Armed Forces of the Philippines, which was led by General Fabian Ver. AFP was ready to mount an airstrike on the day but Marcos ordered them to halt. The actual dialogue on TV between Marcos and then AFP Chief of Staff General Fabian Ver went as follows: =Two inaugurations= Corazon Aquino was inaugurated as the 11th president of the Philippines on February 25, 1986 at Sampaguita Hall (Now Kalayaan Hall). On the morning of Tuesday, February 25, at around 7 a.m., a minor clash occurred between loyal government troops and the reformists. Snipers stationed atop the crony-owned RPN-9 transmitter in Panay Avenue, near MBS-4, began shooting at the reformists. Many rebel soldiers surged to the station, and a rebel S-76 helicopter later shot the snipers at the broadcast tower. The troops later left after a V-150 was blocked by the crowd assembled. Later in the morning, Corazon Aquino was inaugurated as President of the Philippines in a simple ceremony at Club Filipino. in Greenhills, about a kilometer from Camp Crame. She was sworn in as President by Senior Associate Justice Claudio Teehankee, and Laurel as Vice-President by Justice Vicente Abad Santos. The Bible on which Aquino swore her oath was held by her mother- in-law Aurora Aquino, the mother of Ninoy Aquino. Attending the ceremonies were Ramos, who was then promoted to General, Enrile, and many politicians. Outside Club Filipino, all the way to EDSA, hundreds of people cheered and celebrated. Bayan Ko (My Country, a popular folk song and the unofficial National Anthem of protest) was sung after Aquino's oath-taking. Many people wore yellow, the color of Aquino's presidential campaign. An hour later, Marcos held the inauguration at Malaca√±ang Palace. Loyalist civilians attended the ceremony, shouting \\"Marcos, Marcos, Marcos pa rin! (Marcos, Marcos, still Marcos!)\\". On the Palace balcony, Marcos took the Oath of Office, aired on IBC-13 and RPN-9 (RPN-9 was going off-the-air during the broadcast of the inauguration, as its transmitter was captured by reformist soldiers). None of the invited foreign dignitaries attended the ceremony, for security reasons. The couple finally emerged on the balcony of the Palace before 3,000 KBL loyalists who were shouting, \\"Capture the snakes!\\". Rather tearfully, First Lady Imelda Marcos gave a farewell rendition of the couple's theme song ‚Äì the 1938 kundiman \\"Dahil Sa Iyo\\" (Because of You) ‚Äì chanting the song's entreaties in Tagalog: > Because of you, I became happy > Loving I shall offer you > If it is true I shall be enslaved by you > All of this because of you. The broadcast of the event was interrupted as rebel troops successfully captured the other stations. By this time, hundreds of people had amassed at the barricades along Mendiola, only a hundred meters away from Malaca√±ang. They were prevented from storming the Palace by loyal government troops securing the area. The angry demonstrators were pacified by priests who warned them not to be violent. =Marcos' departure= At 3:00 p.m. (EST) on Monday, President Marcos phoned United States Senator Paul Laxalt, asking for advice from the White House. Laxalt advised him to \\"cut and cut clean\\", to which Marcos expressed his disappointment after a short pause. In the afternoon, Marcos talked to Minister Enrile, asking for safe passage for him, his family, and close allies such as General Ver. At midnight PHT, the Marcos family boarded a United States Air Force HH-3E Rescue helicopter. and flew to Clark Air Base in Angeles 83 kilometers north of Manila. At Clark Air Base, Marcos asked to spend a couple of days with his family in Ilocos Norte, his native province. Aquino vetoed the request. President Reagan privately derided Cory Aquino for denying Marcos a last look at his home province. The deposed First Family and their servants then rode US Air Force DC-9 Medivac and C-141B planes to Andersen Air Force Base in the north of the United States territory of Guam, then flying to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii where Marcos finally arrived on February 26. The United States Government documented that they entered the United States with millions of dollars in jewelry, gold, stocks, and cash. When news of the Marcos family's departure reached civilians, many rejoiced and danced in the streets. Over at Mendiola, the demonstrators stormed the Palace, which was closed to ordinary people for around a decade. Despite looting by some angry protesters, the majority wandered about inside through rooms where national history was shaped, looking at objects extravagant and mundane that the Marcos clan and its court had abandoned in their flight. In other countries, people also rejoiced and congratulated Filipinos they knew. CBS anchorman Bob Simon reported: \\"We Americans like to think we taught the Filipinos democracy. Well, tonight they are teaching the world.\\" Some authors say that Marcos prevented civil war similar to the Syrian Civil War by refusing to use guns notwithstanding the insistence of his top general, and by agreeing to step down during the EDSA revolution. The White House said, \\"By leaving the Philippines at a critical juncture in his nation's history, Mr. Marcos permitted the peaceful transition to popular, democratic rule.\\" Aftermath Immediately after her accession, Aquino issued Proclamation No. 3, a provisional constitution which established a revolutionary government. The edict promulgated the 1986 Freedom Constitution, which retained or superseded various provisions of the 1973 Constitution that were in force up to that point. This allowed Aquino to wield both executive and legislative powers; among her first acts was to unilaterally abolish the Batasang Pambansa (the unicameral legislature duly elected in 1984), pending a plebiscite for a more permanent Constitution and the establishment of a new Congress by 1987. The revolution had an effect on democratization movements in such countries as Taiwan and South Korea; other effects include the restoration of the freedom of the press, abolition of repressive laws enforced by the previous regime, the adoption of the 1987 Constitution, and the subordination of the military to civilian rule, despite several coup attempts during Aquino's rule. The revolution provided for the restoration of democratic institutions after thirteen years of totalitarian rule and these institutions has been used by various groups to challenge the entrenched political families and to strengthen Philippine democracy. Legacy A visitor to the Bantayog ng mga Bayani Museum browses through a timeline of the EDSA Revolution, one of the last sequences in the Museum's coverage of protest movements against the Marcos dictatorship.The People Power Revolution has inspired a call for a change of government through peaceful protests rather than bloodshed. Many similar revolutions have followed since then, taking the Philippine example of nonviolent regime change, such as that in East Germany and many other former Soviet Bloc countries. It also helped inspire the Arab Spring in 2011. The EDSA Revolution Anniversary is a special public holiday in the Philippines.

The railroad operates approximately 21,000 route miles (34,000 km) of track.CSX Transportation, Jacksonville, FL. \\"Company Overview.\\" Accessed 2012-12-02. The company operates as a subsidiary of CSX Corporation, a Fortune 500 company headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida. History =Early years= CSX Transportation Building in Jacksonville, Florida CSX Corporation was formed on November 1, 1980, by combining the railroads of the former Chessie System with Seaboard Coast Line Industries. Original logo for the CSX Corporation, emphasizing the \\"multiplication symbol\\" X The name came about during merger talks between Chessie System and SCL, commonly called \\"Chessie\\" and \\"Seaboard\\". The company chairmen said it was important for the new name to include neither of those names because it was a partnership. Employees were asked for suggestions, most of which consisted of combinations of the initials. At the same time a temporary shorthand name was needed for discussions with the Interstate Commerce Commission. \\"CSC\\" was chosen but belonged to a trucking company in Virginia. \\"CSM\\" (for \\"Chessie-Seaboard Merger\\") was also taken. The lawyers decided to use \\"CSX\\", and the name stuck. In the public announcement, it was said that \\"CSX is singularly appropriate. C can stand for Chessie, S for Seaboard, and X, which actually has no meaning.\\" However, an August 9, 2016, article on the Railway Age website stated that \\" ... the 'X' was for 'Consolidated' \\". The T had to be added to CSX when used as a reporting mark because reporting marks that end in X means that the car is owned by a leasing company or private car owner. The company introduced its current slogan, \\"How Tomorrow Moves\\", in 2008. The originator of SCL was the former Seaboard Air Line Railroad, which previously merged with the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad in 1967 to form the Seaboard Coast Line. In later years, it merged with the Louisville & Nashville Railroad, as well as several smaller subsidiaries such as the Clinchfield Railroad, Atlanta & West Point Railroad, Monon Railroad and the Georgia Railroad. From the late 1970s onward these railroads were known collectively as the Family Lines. In 1982, they were merged into a single railroad, the Seaboard System Railroad. The origin of the Chessie System was the former Chesapeake & Ohio Railway, which had merged with the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, and the Western Maryland Railway. Despite the merger in 1980, CSX Transportation never had its own identity (meaning no CSX painted locomotives or rolling stock) as a common carrier railroad until 1986. In that year, Seaboard System changed its name to CSX Transportation. On April 30, 1987, the B&O; merged into the C&O.; With the Western Maryland having already merged into the C&O;, this left the C&O; as the sole operating railroad under the Chessie System banner. Finally, on August 31, 1987, C&O;/Chessie System merged into CSX Transportation, bringing all of the major CSX railroads under one banner. =Conrail acquisition= On June 23, 1997, CSX and Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) filed a joint application with the Surface Transportation Board for authority to purchase, divide, and operate the assets of the Conrail, which had been created in 1976 by bringing together several ailing Northeastern railway systems into a government-owned corporation. On June 6, 1998, the STB approved the CSX‚ÄìNS application and set August 22, 1998, as the effective date of its decision. CSX acquired 42 percent of Conrail's assets, and NS received the remaining 58 percent. As a result of the transaction, CSX's rail operations grew to include some of the Conrail system (predominantly lines that had belonged to the former New York Central Railroad). CSX began operating its trains on its portion of the Conrail network on June 1, 1999. CSX now serves much of the Eastern United States, with a few routes into nearby Canadian cities. =Into the 21st century= In 2014, Canadian Pacific Railway approached CSX with an offer to merge the two companies, but CSX declined, and in 2015 Canadian Pacific made an attempt to purchase and merge with Norfolk Southern, but NS declined to do so as well. In 2017, CSX announced Hunter Harrison would become its new chief executive officer; a settlement with activist investor Paul Hilal and Mantle Ridge. CSX added five new directors to their board, including Harrison and Mantle Ridge founder Paul Hilal. Mantle Ridge owns 4.9% of CSX. Harrison quickly moved to convert CSX rail operations to precision railroading. On December 14, 2017, CSX announced that Hunter Harrison was on medical leave. Two days after the announcement, Harrison died, one day after being hospitalized for complications of an ongoing illness. CSX initially saw a 10% drop in its stock price, but turned around to hit a new 52-week high less than a month later (January 2018). Harrison's successors have continued the shift to precision railroading, with most hump yards converted to flat yards, low volume shipping lanes eliminated and reductions in rolling stock and work force. CSX also operates numerous trains to and from Oak Island Yard in Newark, New Jersey, which is operated by Conrail Shared Assets Operations (CRCX) on its and Norfolk Southern's behalf. CSX operates two pairs of daily trains to/from Oak Island, Q433 and Q434 coming from and going to Selkirk, along with Q300 and Q301 to and from South Philadelphia. Unit trains New River as seen from Hawks Nest State Park CSX operated the Juice Train which consisted of Tropicana cars that carry fresh orange juice between Bradenton, Florida, and the Greenville section of Jersey City, New Jersey. The train also runs from Bradenton to Fort Pierce, Florida, via the Florida East Coast Railway. In the 21st century, the Juice Train has been studied as a model of efficient rail transportation that can compete with trucks and other modes in the perishable-goods trade. All Tropicana trains are now added to other Trains such as Q442 and Q032. Coke Express trains run between Pittsburgh and Chicago, and other places in the Rust Belt, carrying coke to industries, mainly steel mills. CSX also runs daily trash trains Q702 and Q703 from The Bronx to Philadelphia (via Selkirk Yard) and then Petersburg, Virginia, where they interchange with NS. These trains consist of flatcars loaded with four containers of trash. Another pair of trains, Q634 and Q635, operate between Selkirk, New York, and Columbus, Ohio. Another style of unit train is a local trash train, D765, that runs between the Maryland towns of Derwood and Dickerson. The train runs daily except on Sundays; on holidays it sometimes runs twice a day. Trash is carried from Montgomery County's Shady Grove Transfer Station to a waste-to-energy plant located off the PEPCO lead to Mirant's Dickerson Generating Station. The trip is roughly , and the train is made up of National Steel Car Company-built well cars, hauling containers. The first NEMX equipment was built when the D765 first started operations in 1995. In recent years, the fleet has been somewhat upgraded, repainted, and new cars have been constructed. In the early days, the locomotives powering the train were a GP40-2/RDMT slug set, but currently the train can be upwards of 47 cars. The locomotives that now routinely power the train are a pair of GE AC4400CWs, though GEVOs may also be used. Up until May 2019, working with Union Pacific, CSX ran an extended haul perishables train, Q090. Known by railfans as the \\"Salad Shooter\\", the train ran from Wallula, Washington, to Schenectady, New York. On the return trip, the train was labeled Q091. CSX modified its Train Handling rule book to allow this train to use more power axles. In May 2019, the train was abolished. Locomotives =Paint and aesthetics= ES44AC in the YN3 paint scheme. The first official paint scheme under the CSX name was a simple gray paint scheme with blue \\"CSX Transportation\\" lettering. Only 11 units were ever painted into this scheme. The \\"Blue Down\\" paint scheme was introduced about a year after the aforementioned paint scheme in 1987. It is composed with an all-gray body, with a blue underframe and top of the long hood. Blue masked the top of the cab around the windshield. In October 1988, the \\"Stealth\\" scheme was created. It is very similar to Blue Down, but the blue on the top portion of the locomotives was removed. In 1990, the \\"YN2\\", or \\"Bright Future\\" paint scheme was introduced. The design features a yellow nose, a blue cab, and a gray hood with a blue strip along the bottom extending from the back of the cab. The yellow and blue sections have a 60 degree section slanting down toward the back of the locomotive. In 2002, CSXT No. 8503, an EMD SD50 (that has since been downgraded to an SD50-2), was painted in the new yellow and blue YN3 scheme. More than 1,000 CSX locomotives have since been painted in the YN3 scheme. CSX recently created a new paint scheme, known as YN3b, which updates YN3 with the most recent CSX logo. The first unit to wear this scheme was ES44AH 950. Currently, CSX's ES44AHs 950-999 and 3000‚Äì3249 and the ET44AHs 3250-3474 wear the scheme, along with recently repainted older locomotives, the first of which was SD70AC CSXT 4719, which was repainted at the Huntington Locomotive Shops in September 2012. YN3b is also commonly found on the SD40-3 rebuilds. All of the former-Conrail locomotives in active service have been repainted in a CSX livery. In the mid-1990s, CSXT began placing a lightning bolt decal below the road number on locomotives with AC traction and still continues this practice with the new GE ES44AH and ET44AH locomotives. CSX also has several locomotives with \\"spirit\\" stickers with a name of an important person or location in the CSX system. In 2016, CSX placed the logos of several predecessor railroads on some locomotives, in order to maintain legal control of the logos. On April 30, 2019, CSX unveiled locomotives 911 and 1776, two locomotives created to honor the first responders and veterans. Another special unit, CSX 3194, was unveiled on August 22, 2019, in honor of the law enforcement.https://trn.trains.com/news/news-wire/2019/08/22-csx- unveils-spirit-of-our-law-enforcement-commemorative-locomotive-no-3194 =Locomotives= In 2015, CSX traded its 12 EMD SD80MACs for 12 SD40-2s from Norfolk Southern. They have all since been rebuilt as SD40-3s. CSX has been significant in rebuilding locomotives. CSX has 3 rebuilds of its 4 axle EMD Locomotives. The EMD GP38-2, GP40-2, and SD40-2 have all been rebuilt to then Dash 3 standards with updated Wabtec Electronically Controlled Air Brakes, Electronic bells (E-Bell), electronic handbrakes with a mechanical backup, an airstarter on the motor with an electric start backup, a new designed crash safe cab, a new electronic control stand, YN3B paint job, and Positive Train Control (PTC) computers. They became EMD GP38-3s, GP40-3s, and SD40-3s respectively. Most are also Positive Stop Protection ( PSP ) equipped Remote Controlled Locomotives (RCL) and have amber strobe lights on each side of the cab, a Cattron Locomotive Control Unit computer, an Air Brake Transfer Valve ( that transfers brake control from manual to computer control), a speed transponder scanner on each end, and a GPS Receiver on the cab roof to pinpoint the engines location. The Dash 3 RCL can also have its handbrake applied by a Remote Control Operator (RCO) by holding the left and right Vigilance switches on the Operator Control Unit (OCU) remote box. CSX has rebuilt EMD GP35 and GP30 units as road slugs. CSX has also downgraded SD50 and GP40-2 units in order to decrease the wear and tear on the engines the EMD GP40-2s that were downgraded from 3,000 horsepower to 2,000 horsepower during this process are known as GP38-2S locomotives and CSXT 6044 is one of those that was derated. Among its EMD rebuilds, CSX has done rebuilding on many GE locomotives as well. CSX has re-powered most of its GE CW60AC and CW60AH locomotives with a GEVO-16 engine rated at , essentially making them an over- engined ES44AH called a CW46AH by CSX. Former Conrail GE B40-8 units have also been downgraded to in an attempt to decrease wheel slip and low speeds. They were redesignated as B20-8s and CSX has since sold or stored most of these units including the 6 axle GE C40-8s. Another group of projects are the \\"heavy\\" units. CSX has modified some GE CW44AC and CW44AH units to heavy units by adding extra counterweights to the frame and in the nose of the unit shell and new computers to increase tractive effort at low speeds, they are 432,000 pounds. CSX has also obtained a few EMD F40PHs that were retired from Amtrak for executive office car service and geometry trains. Another locomotive, an ex-MARC GP40WH-2, was acquired for the same purpose. With the arrival of Hunter Harrison, CSX has begun to store many locomotives. By the end of 2017, CSX plans to store or retire all of the GE CW40-8, CW40-9, CW60AC, CW60AH, CW46AH, EMD SD50, SD50-2, SD50-3, SD60, SD60M, SD60I, SD70M, SD70AC, and SD70AE (SD70ACe) units. Most of the GE C40-8, B40-8, and B20-8 units stored in Corbin, Kentucky, have already been retired and sold off. Even with the passing of Harrison, his replacement, James Foote, confirmed the locomotives would still be retired. CSX ordered ten SD70ACe-T4s in August 2018, which were delivered in July the following year. They are classified as ST70AHs. CSX also has a contract with Wabtec for modernizing their fleet of CW44s. The modernized locomotives, nearly thirty in number as of June 2020, are being classified as CM44s. Safety Wrecked Amtrak 255 in the 1996 Maryland train collision. Because of Ross Rowland running C&O; 614 above the speed limits, in 1995, CSX started a new liability insurance requirement of $200 million to introduce their official policy, \\"no steam on its own wheels\\", banning the operation of steam locomotives and other antique rail equipment on their trackage due to safety concerns, and increased risk. =List of accidents and incidents= *1986 Miamisburg, Ohio, train derailment *1993 Big Bayou Canot train wreck *1996 Maryland train collision *2001 CSX 8888 incident, 1 minor injury.

The story is very tongue-in-cheek, and pokes fun at a number of anime clich√©s, including the overuse of super deformation, across a wide range of genres, similar to anime such as Excel Saga. Much of the manga contains references to role-playing games and occasionally either other manga, or anything that begins with the word dragon. Ry≈´suke Mita's favorite animal is the dragon. As a result, several dragons play an important role in the manga, most notably Mana and her father, Titan.  Plot  Mink was born to a man who used to be a skilled swordsman and a female imperial red dragon. At age fifteen, she falls in love with a singer named Dick Saucer; but because he is also a dragonslayer, she has no choice but to get a potion that can change her into a pure human. She can only get the potion, however, if she can slay the most powerful Demon Lord in the land, Azetodeth, and go to his palace known as the Demon King's island. Not only does she have to reconstruct the Gourd of the Saints, an item that can seal Azetodeth, she also has to be aware of Princess Vina, her rival for Saucer's affections. Mink is aided by her friends Lufa, Pia, and a fairy mouse named Mappy on her quest. After a number of adventures, mainly a conflict with a vampire and her four handmaidens and discovering Dick Saucer's past, Mink finally comes face to face with Azetodeth. She manages to seal the Demon Lord away with the Gourd of Saints, and although she gains the potion, she chooses to remain half-human, half-imperial red dragon forever. Instead of using the potion herself, she gives the potion to her friend Lufa, who had been turned into a toad by the Demon Lord's magic.  Terminology  = Locations = ;The Demon King's island :An island where Azetodeth and his three sons live. This island has tall rugged rocks and is surrounded by a wall that prevents anything that goes through unless it goes into the main entrance which is difficult to find or a gate guarded by a receptionist named Suzuki who is beaten by Mink and runs off. The island is first seen at the end of Chapter 13. After making several more cameos, Mink finally gets on the island in Chapter 50. There is also a castle which is completely destroyed by Azetodeth in Chapter 64. ;Village of the Red Lightning :The village where Mink and her family and friends live. It is shown in the beginning having a river flowing through it and mountains surrounding it, and is shown again in the credits. = Items = ;The Gourd of the Saints :The Gourd of the Saints is a bottle that took 200 years for Mink's dragon great-grandfather to make. It was broken into three pieces which transformed into three holy artifacts 2000 years ago. The artifacts were Parza's holy grail (a goblet), Lorelo's Ball (a black ball that \\"provides super-screw\\") and Gill's crown. The Gourd of the Saints is extremely important as it is the only one that can seal Azetodeth away. = The three holy artifacts = There are three sacred treasures required to resurrect the gourd known as the three holy artifacts (Sango no Jingi in the Japanese version). They are loosely based on the Imperial Regalia of Japan. Parza's holy grail represents the mirror of wisdom, Lorelo's ball represents the Jewel of Benevolence and Gil's crown represents the sword of valor. However, only Lorelo's ball and the jewel of benevolence correspond to each other in the story. Media = Manga = Dragon Half was released in two versions. The first was as seven standard tank≈çbon, and the second was a wideban release comprising three volumes which included extra galleries and interviews with Mita not found in the original releases.Mita Ry≈´suke English Fan page (English)October 20, 2007 The manga consists of 65 chapters. After Dragon Half ended, Ry≈´suke Mita created a sequel one-shot called Dragon Half Z about Mink's seven-year-old daughter Pink. The manga has been licensed in North America by Seven Seas Entertainment. = Anime = A 2-episode OVA series adaptation was animated by Production I.G in 1993. It was written and directed by Shin'ya Sadamitsu, with character designs by Masahiro Koyama and music by K≈çhei Tanaka. The first OVA, , was released on March 26, 1993. The second, , was released two months later on May 28, 1993. The OVA series is based on sections of the first two volumes. There were originally going to be 4 OVA episodes but there was not enough interest so only two episodes were produced. The ending theme song, My Omelette, was written to the music of Beethoven (Symphony No. 7, 4th movement) and sung by Kotono Mitsuishi while in character. The OVA has also inspired a game for the PC Engine, also called Dragon Half, released by Microcabin of Xak series fame. The game is an RPG and roughly follows the plot of the OVA. The OVA's voice actors returned to voice roles in the game.

The pillory is related to the stocks.  Etymology  The word is documented in English since 1274 (attested in Anglo- Latin from ), and stems from Old French (1168; modern French , see below), itself from medieval Latin , of uncertain origin, perhaps a diminutive of Latin 'pillar, stone barrier'. Description Rather like the lesser punishment called the stocks, the pillory consisted of hinged wooden boards forming holes through which the head and/or various limbs were inserted; then the boards were locked together to secure the captive. Pillories were set up to hold people in marketplaces, crossroads, and other public places. They were often placed on platforms to increase public visibility of the person. Often a placard detailing the crime was placed nearby; these punishments generally lasted only a few hours. Pillory from Dalarna Region, Sweden (Nordic Museum, Stockholm) In being forced to bend forward and stick their head and hands out in front of them, offenders in the pillory would have been extremely uncomfortable during their punishment. However, the main purpose in putting criminals in the pillory was to humiliate them publicly. On discovering that the pillory was occupied, people would excitedly gather in the marketplace to taunt, tease and laugh at the offender on display. Those who gathered to watch the punishment typically wanted to make the offender's experience as unpleasant as possible. In addition to being jeered and mocked, those in the pillory might be pelted with rotten food, mud, offal, dead animals, and animal excrement. Sometimes people were killed or maimed in the pillory because crowds could get too violent and pelt the offender with stones, bricks and other dangerous objects. However, when Daniel Defoe was sentenced to the pillory in 1703 for seditious libel, he was regarded as a hero by the crowd and was pelted with flowers. The criminal could also be sentenced to further punishments while in the pillory: humiliation by shaving off some or all hair or regular corporal punishment(s), notably flagellation (the pillory serving as the \\"whipping post\\") or even permanent mutilation such as branding or having an ear cut off (cropping), as in the case of John Bastwick. In Protestant cultures (such as in the Scandinavian countries), the pillory would be the worldly part of a church punishment. The delinquent would therefore first serve the ecclesiastical part of his punishment on the pillory bench in the church itself, and then be handed to the worldly authorities to be bound to the Skamp√•le (literally: \\"Shame Pole\\") for public humiliation. Uses The pillory at Charing Cross in London, c. 1808\\\\. In 1816, use of the pillory was restricted in England to punishment for perjury or subornation. The pillory was formally abolished as a form of punishment in England and Wales in 1837, but the stocks remained in use, though extremely infrequently, until 1872. The last person to be pilloried in England was Peter James Bossy, who was convicted of \\"wilful and corrupt perjury\\" in 1830. He was offered the choice of seven years' penal transportation or one hour in the pillory, and chose the latter. In France, time in the \\"pilori\\" was usually limited to two hours. It was replaced in 1789 by \\"exposition\\", and abolished in 1832. Two types of devices were used: * The poteau (literally: \\"post\\" or \\"pole\\") was a simple post, often with a board around only the neck, and was synonymous with the mode of punishment. This was the same as the schandpaal (\\"shamepole\\") in Dutch. The carcan, an iron ring around the neck to tie a prisoner to such a post, was the name of a similar punishment that was abolished in 1832. A criminal convicted to serve time in a prison or galleys would, prior to his incarceration, be attached for two to six hours (depending on whether he was convicted to prison or the galleys) to the carcan, with his name, crime and sentence written on a board over his head. * A permanent small tower, the upper floor of which had a ring made of wood or iron with holes for the victim's head and arms, which was often on a turntable to expose the condemned to all parts of the crowd. John Waller who was killed while being pilloried in London in 1732 Like other permanent apparatus for physical punishment, the pillory was often placed prominently and constructed more elaborately than necessary. It served as a symbol of the power of the judicial authorities, and its continual presence was seen as a deterrent, like permanent gallows for authorities endowed with high justice. The Vere Street Coterie at the pillory in 1810. In Portugal, it is called Pelourinho, and there are monuments of great importance because they are known since the Roman times. Usually, they are located on the main square of the town, and/or in front of a major church or a palace. They are made of stone with a column and the top carved. Pelourinhos are considered major local monuments, several clearly bearing the coat of arms of a king or queen. The same is true of its former colonies, notably in Brazil (in its former capital, Salvador, the whole old quarter is known as Pelourinho) and Africa (e.g. Cape Verde's old capital, Cidade Velha), always as symbols of royal power. In Spain it was called picota. The pillory was also in common use in other western countries and colonies, and similar devices were used in other, non-Western cultures. According to one source, the pillory was abolished as a form of punishment in the United States in 1839, but this cannot be entirely true because it was clearly in use in Delaware as recently as 1901. Governor Preston Lea finally signed a bill to abolish the pillory in Delaware in March 1905.Spokesman-Review (Spokane, Wash.). \\"Has Abolished The Pillory\\". 22 March 1905, p. 6. Retrieved on 2 October 2013. Punishment by whipping-post remained on the books in Delaware until 1972, when it became the last state to abolish it.1973 World Almanac and Book of Facts p. 90. Delaware was the last state to sentence someone to whipping in 1963; however, the sentence was commuted. The last whipping in Delaware was in 1952. Similar humiliation devices Daniel Defoe in the pillory, 1862 line engraving by James Charles Armytage after Eyre Crowe Combined pillory and whipping post in New Castle County Jail, Delaware, 1907. The pillory sits in an elevated position to increase its visibility, while the whipping post is at ground level to provide more room for the whipper. There was a variant (rather of the stocks type), called a barrel pillory, or Spanish mantle, used to punish drunks, which is reported in England and among its troops. It fitted over the entire body, with the head sticking out from a hole in the top. The criminal is put in either an enclosed barrel, forcing him to kneel in his own filth, or an open barrel, also known as \\"barrel shirt\\" or \\"drunkards collar\\" after the punishable crime, leaving him to roam about town or military camp and be ridiculed and scorned.Images of barrels and other stocks as used in imperial China . Whipping post in Fremantle Prison in Western Australia. Although a pillory, by its physical nature, could double as a whipping post to tie a criminal down for public flagellation (as used to be the case in many German sentences to staupenschlag), the two as such are separate punishments: the pillory is a sentence to public humiliation, whipping is an essentially painful corporal punishment. Sometimes a single structure was built with separate locations for the two punishments, with a whipping post on the lower level and a pillory above (see image at right). When permanently present in sight of prisoners, whipping posts were thought to act as a deterrent against bad behaviour, especially when each prisoner had been subjected to a \\"welcome beating\\" on arrival, as in 18th-century Waldheim in Saxony (12, 18 or 24 whip lashes on the bare posterior tied to a pole in the castle courtyard, or by birch rod over the \\"bock\\", a bench in the corner). Still a different penal use of such constructions is to tie the criminal down, possibly after a beating, to expose him for a long time to the elements, usually without food and drink, even to the point of starvation. Notable cases *Peter Annet *Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald *Daniel Defoe *James Nayler *Elizabeth Needham *Titus Oates Legacy A pillory at the Medieval Market in Turku, Finland. While the pillory has left common use, the image remains preserved in the figurative use, which has become the dominant one, of the verb \\"to pillory\\" (attested in English since 1699),Richard Bentley, Dissertation on the Epistles of Phalaris; cited in the Oxford English Dictionary meaning \\"to expose to public ridicule, scorn and abuse\\", or more generally to humiliate before witnesses. Corresponding expressions exist in other languages, e.g., clouer au pilori \\"to nail to the pillory\\" in French, or mettere alla gogna in Italian, or poner en la picota in Spanish. In Dutch it's aan de schandpaal nagelen or aan de kaak stellen, placing even greater emphasis on the predominantly humiliating character as the Dutch word for pillory, schandpaal, literally meaning \\"pole of shame\\".

Chibi ( or ) is a Japanese slang word describing something short (a thing, an animal or a person). It comes from the verb Á¶ø„Å≥„Çã (chibiru), which means 'to wear out and become shorter' (the tip of something). Chibi-debu („Å°„Å≥„Éá„Éñ or „ÉÅ„Éì„Éá„Éñ) is used to describe something or someone that is both short and chubby. Chibi is widely used in Japan to describe a specific style of caricature where characters are drawn in an exaggerated way. Typically these characters are small and chubby, with stubby limbs and oversized heads to make them resemble children. This style of artwork, also known as super deformed (shorthanded as SD), has since found its way into anime and manga fandom through its usage in manga works. Chibi can be translated as 'little' (e.g. Chibi Maruko-chan, which means Little Miss Maruko), but it is not used the same way as chiisana [Â∞è„Åï„Å™] and chiisai [Â∞è„Åï„ÅÑ] ('tiny', 'small', 'little' in Japanese), but rather 'cute'. Proportions The head of a super deformed character is normally anywhere between one third and one half the character's height. In addition to their modified proportions, super deformed characters typically lack the detail of their normal counterparts. As a result, when a character of average proportions is depicted as a super deformed character, certain aspects of their design will be simplified and others will be exaggerated. Details such as folds on a jacket are ignored, and general shapes are favored. If a character has a signature characteristic (odd hair, a particular accessory, etc.) this will typically be prominent on the super deformed version of the character.How to Draw Manga Volume 18: Super-Deformed Characters 1: Humans. Media usage One example of chibi's usage in Japanese, which brought the term to the attention of Western fans, is Chibiusa; this diminutive pet name for the daughter of Sailor Moon comes from Chibi Usagi ('Little Rabbit'). The chibi art style is part of Japanese culture, and is seen everywhere from advertising and subway signs to anime and manga. The style was popularized by franchises like Dragon Ball and SD Gundam in the 1980s. It is used as comic relief in anime and manga, giving additional emphasis to a character's emotional reaction. The art style has also appeared in anime-influenced American series such as Homestuck, Teen Titans, and Avatar: The Last Airbender, which feature super deformed shorts.

The park protects some of the best-preserved Ancestral Puebloan archaeological sites in the United States. Established by Congress and President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906, the park occupies near the Four Corners region of the American Southwest. With more than 5,000 sites, including 600 cliff dwellings, it is the largest archaeological preserve in the United States. Mesa Verde (Spanish for \\"green table\\") is best known for structures such as Cliff Palace, thought to be the largest cliff dwelling in North America. Starting BC Mesa Verde was seasonally inhabited by a group of nomadic Paleo-Indians known as the Foothills Mountain Complex. The variety of projectile points found in the region indicates they were influenced by surrounding areas, including the Great Basin, the San Juan Basin, and the Rio Grande Valley. Later, Archaic people established semi- permanent rock shelters in and around the mesa. By 1000 BC, the Basketmaker culture emerged from the local Archaic population, and by 750 AD the Ancestral Puebloans had developed from the Basketmaker culture. The Mesa Verdeans survived using a combination of hunting, gathering, and subsistence farming of crops such as corn, beans, and squash. They built the mesa's first pueblos sometime after 650, and by the end of the 12th century, they began to construct the massive cliff dwellings for which the park is best known. By 1285, following a period of social and environmental instability driven by a series of severe and prolonged droughts, they abandoned the area and moved south to locations in Arizona and New Mexico, including Rio Chama, Pajarito Plateau, and Santa Fe. Inhabitants =Paleo-Indians= glyptodont, by Heinrich Harder The first occupants of the Mesa Verde region, which spans from southeastern Utah to northwestern New Mexico, were nomadic Paleo-Indians who arrived in the area BC.: Paleo-Indians; : southeastern Utah to northwestern New Mexico. They followed herds of big game and camped near rivers and streams, many of which dried up as the glaciers that once covered parts of the San Juan Mountains receded. The earliest Paleo-Indians were the Clovis culture and Folsom tradition, defined largely by how they fashioned projectile points. Although they left evidence of their presence throughout the region, there is little indication that they lived in central Mesa Verde during this time. After 9600 BC, the area's environment grew warmer and drier, a change that brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive in them. Paleo-Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers , though it is unclear whether they were seasonal occupants or year-round residents. Development of the atlatl during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game, a crucial advance at a time when most of the region's big game had disappeared from the landscape. =Archaic= pictographs, BC, Sego Canyon, Utah 6000 BC marks the beginning of the Archaic period in North America. Archaeologists differ as to the origin of the Mesa Verde Archaic population; some believe they developed exclusively from local Paleo-Indians, called the Foothills Mountain Complex, but others suggest that the variety of projectile points found in Mesa Verde indicates influence from surrounding areas, including the Great Basin, the San Juan Basin, and the Rio Grande Valley. The Archaic people probably developed locally, but were also influenced by contact, trade, and intermarriage with immigrants from these outlying areas. The early Archaic people living near Mesa Verde utilized the atlatl and harvested a wider variety of plants and animals than the Paleo- Indians had while retaining their primarily nomadic lifestyle. They inhabited the outlying areas of the Mesa Verde region, but also the mountains, mesa tops, and canyons, where they created rock shelters and rock art, and left evidence of animal processing and chert knapping. Environmental stability during the period drove population expansion and migration. Major warming and drying from 5000 to 2500 might have led middle Archaic people to seek the cooler climate of Mesa Verde, whose higher elevation brought increased snowpack that, when coupled with spring rains, provided relatively plentiful amounts of water. By the late Archaic, more people were living in semi- permanent rock shelters that preserved perishable goods such as baskets, sandals, and mats. They started to make a variety of twig figurines that usually resembled sheep or deer. The late Archaic is marked by increased trade in exotic materials such as obsidian and turquoise. Marine shells and abalone from the Pacific coast made their way to Mesa Verde from Arizona, and the Archaic people worked them into necklaces and pendants. Rock art flourished, and people lived in rudimentary houses made of mud and wood. Their early attempts at plant domestication eventually developed into the sustained agriculture that marked the end of the Archaic period, . =Basketmaker culture= Basketmaker II basket, With the introduction of corn to the Mesa Verde region BC and the trend away from nomadism toward permanent pithouse settlements, the Archaic Mesa Verdeans transitioned into what archaeologists call the Basketmaker culture. Basketmaker II people are characterized by their combination of foraging and farming skills, use of the atlatl, and creation of finely woven baskets in the absence of earthen pottery. By 300, corn had become the preeminent staple of the Basketmaker II people's diet, which relied less and less on wild food sources and more on domesticated crops. In addition to the fine basketry for which they were named, Basketmaker II people fashioned a variety of household items from plant and animal materials, including sandals, robes, pouches, mats, and blankets. They also made clay pipes and gaming pieces. Basketmaker men were relatively short and muscular, averaging less than tall. Their skeletal remains reveal signs of hard labor and extensive travel, including degenerative joint disease, healed fractures, and moderate anemia associated with iron deficiency. They buried their dead near or amongst their settlements, and often included luxury items as gifts, which might indicate differences in relative social status. Basketmaker II people are also known for their distinctive rock art, which can be found throughout Mesa Verde. They depicted animals and people, in both abstract and realistic forms, in single works and more elaborate panels. A common subject was the hunchbacked flute player that the Hopi call Kokopelli. Basketmaker III basket, By 500 AD, atlatls were being supplanted by the bow and arrow and baskets by pottery, marking the end of the Basketmaker II Era and the beginning of the Basketmaker III Era.: end of Basketmaker II; beginning of Basketmaker III. Ceramic vessels were a major improvement over pitch-lined baskets, gourds, and animal hide containers, which had been the primary water storage containers in the region. Pottery also protected seeds against mold, insects, and rodents. By 600, Mesa Verdeans were using clay pots to cook soups and stews. Year-round settlements first appear around this time. The population of the San Juan Basin increased markedly after 575, when there were very few Basketmaker III sites in Mesa Verde; by the early 7th century, there were many such sites in the mesa. For the next 150 years, villages typically consisted of small groups of one to three residences. The population of Mesa Verde was approximately 1,000 to 1,500 people. Beans and new varieties of corn were introduced to the region . By 775, some settlements had grown to accommodate more than one hundred people; the construction of large, above- ground storage buildings began around this time. Basketmakers endeavored to store enough food for their family for one year, but also retained residential mobility so they could quickly relocate their dwellings in the event of resource depletion or consistently inadequate crop yields. By the end of the 8th century, the smaller hamlets, which were typically occupied for ten to forty years, had been supplanted by larger ones that saw continuous occupation for as many as two generations. Basketmaker III people established a tradition of holding large ceremonial gatherings near community pit structures. =Ancestral Puebloans= Pueblo I: 750 to 900 750 marks the end of the Basketmaker III Era and the beginning of the Pueblo I period. The transition is characterized by major changes in the design and construction of buildings and the organization of household activities. Pueblo I people doubled their capacity for food storage from one year to two and built interconnected, year-round residences called pueblos. Many household activities that had previously been reserved for subterranean pithouses were moved to these above-ground dwellings. This altered the function of pithouses from all-purpose spaces to ones used primarily for community ceremonies, although they continued to house large extended families, particularly during winter months. During the late 8th century, Mesa Verdeans began building square pit structures that archaeologists call protokivas. They were typically deep and wide. The first pueblos appeared at Mesa Verde sometime after 650; by 850 more than half of Mesa Verdeans lived in them. As local populations grew, Puebloans found it difficult to survive on hunting, foraging, and gardening, which made them increasingly reliant on domesticated corn. This shift from semi-nomadism to a \\"sedentary and communal way of life changed ancestral Pueblo society forever\\". Within a generation the average number of households in these settlements grew from one to three to fifteen to twenty, with average populations of two hundred people. Population density increased dramatically, with as many as a dozen families occupying roughly the same space that had formerly housed two. This brought increased security against raids and encouraged greater cooperation amongst residents. It also facilitated trade and intermarriage between clans, and by the late 8th century, as Mesa Verde's population was being augmented by settlers from the south, four distinct cultural groups occupied the same villages. Large Pueblo I settlements laid claim to the resources found within . They were typically organized in groups of at least three and spaced about apart. By 860, there were approximately 8,000 people living in Mesa Verde. Within the plazas of larger villages, the Pueblo I people dug massive pit structures of that became central gathering places. These structures represent early architectural expressions of what would eventually develop into the Pueblo II Era great houses of Chaco Canyon. Despite robust growth during the early and mid-9th century, unpredictable rainfall and periodic drought led to a dramatic reversal of settlement trends in the area. Many late Pueblo I villages were abandoned after less than forty years of occupation, and by 880 Mesa Verde's population was in steady decline. The beginning of the 10th century saw widespread depopulation of the region, as people emigrated south of the San Juan River to Chaco Canyon in search of reliable rains for farming. As Mesa Verdeans migrated south, to where many of their ancestors had emigrated two hundred years before, the influence of Chaco Canyon grew, and by 950 Chaco had supplanted Mesa Verde as the region's cultural center. Pueblo II: 900 to 1150 Square Tower House The Pueblo II Period is marked by the growth and outreach of communities centered around the great houses of Chaco Canyon. Despite their participation in the vast Chacoan system, Mesa Verdeans retained a distinct cultural identity while melding regional innovation with ancient tradition, inspiring further architectural advancements; the 9th century Mesa Verdean pueblos influenced two hundred years of Chacoan great house construction. Droughts during the late 9th century rendered Mesa Verdean dry land farming unreliable, which led to their growing crops only near drainages for the next 150 years. Crop yields returned to healthy levels by the early 11th century. By 1050 the population of the area began to rebound; as agricultural prosperity increased, people immigrated to Mesa Verde from the south. Mesa Verdean farmers increasingly relied on masonry reservoirs during the Pueblo II Era. During the 11th century, they built check dams and terraces near drainages and slopes in an effort to conserve soil and runoff. These fields offset the danger of crop failures in the larger dry land fields. By the mid-10th and early 11th centuries, protokivas had evolved into smaller circular structures called kivas, which were usually across. These Mesa Verde-style kivas included a feature from earlier times called a sipapu, which is a hole dug in the north of the chamber and symbolizes the Ancestral Puebloan's place of emergence from the underworld. At this time, Mesa Verdeans began to move away from the post and mud jacal-style buildings that marked the Pueblo I Period toward masonry construction, which had been utilized in the region as early as 700, but was not widespread until the 11th and 12th centuries. The expansion of Chacoan influence in the Mesa Verde area left its most visible mark in the form of Chaco-style masonry great houses that became the focal point of many Mesa Verdean villages after 1075. Far View House, the largest of these, is considered a classic Chaco \\"outlier,\\" on which construction likely began between 1075 and 1125, although some archaeologists argue that it was begun as early as 1020.Lekson, Stephen. The Chaco Meridian: One Thousand Years of Political and Religious Power in the Ancient Southwest. Rowman & Littlefield, 2015 The era's timber and earth unit pueblos were typically inhabited for about twenty years. During the early 12th century, the locus of regional control shifted away from Chaco to Aztec, New Mexico, in the southern Mesa Verde region. By 1150, drought had once again stressed the region's inhabitants, leading to a temporary cessation of great house construction at Mesa Verde. Pueblo III: 1150 to 1300 Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park. A severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led to rapid depopulation in many parts of the San Juan Basin, particularly at Chaco Canyon. As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed, people increasingly migrated to Mesa Verde, causing major population growth in the area. This led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people, which reduced mobility for Mesa Verdeans, who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy. In order to sustain these larger populations, they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming. Population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the Mesa Verdeans had relied on, further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought-related failure. The Chacoan system brought large quantities of imported goods to Mesa Verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, including pottery, shells, and turquoise, but by the late 12th century, as the system collapsed, the amount of goods imported by the mesa quickly declined, and Mesa Verde became isolated from the surrounding region. For approximately six hundred years, most Mesa Verdean farmers had lived in small, mesa-top homesteads of one or two families. They were typically located near their fields and walking distance to sources of water. This practice continued into the mid- to late 12th century, but by the start of the 13th century they began living in canyon locations that were close to water sources and within walking distance of their fields. Mesa Verdean villages thrived during the mid-Pueblo III Era, when architects constructed massive, multi- story buildings, and artisans adorned pottery with increasingly elaborate designs. Structures built during this period have been described as \\"among the world's greatest archaeological treasures\\". Pueblo III masonry buildings were typically occupied for approximately fifty years, more than double the usable lifespan of the Pueblo II jacal structures. Others were continuously inhabited for two hundred years or more. Architectural innovations such as towers and multi-walled structures also appear during the Pueblo III Era. Mesa Verde's population remained fairly stable during the 12th century drought. At the start of the 13th century, approximately 22,000 people lived there. The area saw moderate population increases during the following decades, and dramatic ones from 1225 to 1260. Most of the people in the region lived in the plains west of the mesa at locations such as Yellow Jacket Pueblo, near Cortez, Colorado. Others colonized canyon rims and slopes in multi-family structures that grew to unprecedented size as populations swelled. By 1260, the majority of Mesa Verdeans lived in large pueblos that housed several families and more than one hundred people. The 13th century saw 69 years of below average rainfall in the Mesa Verde region, and after 1270 the area suffered from especially cold temperatures. Dendrochronology indicates that the last tree felled for construction on the mesa was cut in 1281. There was a major decline in ceramic imports to the region during this time, but local production remained steady. Despite challenging conditions, the Puebloans continued to farm the area until a severely dry period from 1276 to 1299 ended seven hundred years of continuous human occupation at Mesa Verde. Archaeologists refer to this period as the \\"Great Drought\\". The last inhabitants of the mesa left the area . Warfare Oak Tree House During the Pueblo III period (1150 to 1300), Mesa Verdeans built numerous stone masonry towers that likely served as defensive structures. They often incorporated hidden tunnels connecting the towers to associated kivas. Warfare was conducted using the same tools the Mesa Verdeans used for hunting game, including bows and arrows, stone axes, and wooden clubs and spears. They also crafted hide and basket shields that were used only during battles. Periodic warfare occurred on the mesa throughout the 13th century. Civic leaders in the region likely attained power and prestige by distributing food during times of drought. This system probably broke down during the \\"Great Drought\\", leading to intense warfare between competing clans. Increasing economic and social uncertainty during the century's final decades led to widespread conflict. Evidence of partly burned villages and post-mortem trauma have been uncovered, and the residents of one village appear to have been the victims of a site-wide massacre. Evidence of violence and cannibalism has been documented in the central Mesa Verde region. While most of the violence, which peaked between 1275 and 1285, is generally ascribed to in-fighting amongst Mesa Verdeans, archaeological evidence found at Sand Canyon Pueblo, in Canyons of the Ancients National Monument, suggests that violent interactions also occurred between Mesa Verdeans and people from outside the region. Evidence of the attacks was discovered by members of the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center during the 1990s. The assaults, which also occurred at the national monument's Castle Rock Pueblo, were dated to , and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of Puebloan occupation at those sites. Many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures, and the uniformity of the injuries suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe. Others were scalped, dismembered, and cannibalized. The anthropophagy (cannibalism) might have been undertaken as a survival strategy during times of starvation. The archaeological record indicates that, rather than being isolated to the Mesa Verde region, violent conflict was widespread in North America during the late 13th and early 14th centuries, and was likely exacerbated by global climate changes that negatively affected food supplies throughout the continent. Migration The Mesa Verde region saw unusually cold and dry conditions during the beginning of the 13th century. This might have driven emigration to Mesa Verde from less hospitable locations. The added population stressed the mesa's environment, further straining an agricultural society that was suffering from drought. The region's bimodal precipitation pattern, which brought rainfall during spring and summer and snowfall during autumn and winter, began to fail post-1250. After 1260, there was a rapid depopulation of Mesa Verde, as \\"tens of thousands of people\\" emigrated or died from starvation. Many smaller communities in the Four Corners region were also abandoned during this period. The Ancestral Puebloans had a long history of migration in the face of environmental instability, but the depopulation of Mesa Verde at the end of the 13th century was different in that the region was almost completely emptied, and no descendants returned to build permanent settlements. While drought, resource depletion, and overpopulation all contributed to instability during the last two centuries of Ancestral Puebloan occupation, their overdependence on maize crops is considered the \\"fatal flaw\\" of their subsistence strategy. The vacating Mesa Verdeans left almost no direct evidence of their migration, but they left behind household goods, including cooking utensils, tools, and clothing, which gave archaeologists the impression that the emigration was haphazard or hurried. An estimated 20,000 people lived in the region during the 13th century, but by the start of the 14th century the area was nearly uninhabited. Many emigrants relocated to southern Arizona and New Mexico. Although the rate of settlement is unclear, increases in sparsely populated areas, such as Rio Chama, Pajarito Plateau, and Santa Fe, correspond directly with the period of migration from Mesa Verde. Archaeologists believe the Mesa Verdeans who settled in the areas near the Rio Grande, where Mesa Verde black-on-white pottery became widespread during the 14th century, were likely related to the households they joined and not unwelcome intruders. Archaeologists view this migration as a continuation, versus a dissolution, of Ancestral Puebloan society and culture. Many others relocated to the banks of the Little Colorado River, in western New Mexico and eastern Arizona. While archaeologists tend to focus on the \\"push\\" factors that drove the Mesa Verdeans away from the region, there were also several environmental \\"pull factors\\", such as warmer temperatures, better farming conditions, plentiful timber, and bison herds, which incentivized relocation to the area near the Rio Grande. In addition to numerous settlements along the Rio Grande, contemporary descendants of the Mesa Verdeans live in pueblos at Acoma, Zuni, Jemez, and Laguna. Organization Although Chaco Canyon might have exerted regional control over Mesa Verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries, most archaeologists view the Mesa Verde region as a collection of smaller communities based on central sites and related outliers that were never fully integrated into a larger civic structure. Several ancient roads, averaging wide and lined with earthen berms, have been identified in the region. Most appear to connect communities and shrines; others encircle great house sites. The extent of the network is unclear, but no roads have been discovered leading to the Chacoan Great North Road, or directly connecting Mesa Verde and Chacoan sites. Ancestral Puebloan shrines, called herraduras, have been identified near road segments in the region. Their purpose is unclear, but several C-shaped herraduras have been excavated, and they are thought to have been \\"directional shrines\\" used to indicate the location of great houses. Architecture Section view of Kiva A in Mesa Verde's Fire Temple, cut from laser scan data collected by a CyArk/National Park Service partnership. Since Fire Temple was at least partially built to conform to the dimensions of the cliff alcove in which it was built, it is neither round in form nor truly subterranean like other structures generally defined as kivas. Mesa Verde is best known for a large number of well- preserved cliff dwellings, houses built in alcoves, or rock overhangs along the canyon walls. The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone, held together and plastered with adobe mortar. Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls. In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas, the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region-wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close, highly defensible quarters during the 13th century. Pueblo buildings were built with stone, windows facing south, and in U, E and L shapes. The buildings were located more closely together and reflected deepening religious celebration. Towers were built near kivas and likely used for lookouts. Pottery became more versatile, including pitchers, ladles, bowls, jars and dishware for food and drink. White pottery with black designs emerged, the pigments coming from plants. Water management and conservation techniques, including the use of reservoirs and silt-retaining dams, also emerged during this period. Styles for these sandstone/mortar constructions, both surface and cliff dwellings, included T-shaped windows and doors. This has been taken by some archaeologists, including Stephen H. Lekson, as evidence of the continuing reach of the Chacoan system. Other researchers see these elements as part of a more generalized Puebloan style or spiritual significance rather than evidence of a continuing specific elite socioeconomic system.Phillips, David A., Jr., 2000, \\"The Chaco Meridian: A skeptical analysis\\" paper presented to the 65th annual meeting of the Society of American Archaeology, Philadelphia. While much of the construction in these sites is consistent with common Pueblo architectural forms, including kivas, towers, and pit-houses, the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what seems to have been a far denser concentration of their populations. Mug House, a typical cliff dwelling of the period, was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built against each other and sharing many of their walls; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could, with no areas considered off-limits to construction. Astronomy The Sun Temple at Mesa Verde Mesa Verdeans used astronomical observations to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural features in the landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose. Several great houses in the region were aligned to the cardinal directions, which positioned windows, doors, and walls along the path of the sun, whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons. Mesa Verde's Sun Temple is thought to have been an astronomical observatory. The temple is D-shaped, and its alignment is 10.7 degrees off true east‚Äìwest. Its location and orientation indicate that its builders understood the cycles of both the sun and the moon. It is aligned to the major lunar standstill, which occurs once every 18.6 years, and the sunset during the winter solstice, which can be viewed setting over the temple from a platform at the south end of Cliff Palace, across Fewkes Canyon. At the bottom of the canyon is the Sun Temple fire pit, which is illuminated by the first rays of the rising sun during the winter solstice. Sun Temple is one of the largest exclusively ceremonial structures ever built by the Ancestral Puebloans. Agriculture and water-control systems Far View Reservoir Starting in the 6th century, the farmers living in central Mesa Verde cultivated corn, beans, squash, and gourds. The combination of corn and beans provided the Mesa Verdeans with the amino acids of a complete protein. When conditions were good, of land would provide enough food for a family of three or four individuals for one year, providing they supplemented with game and wild plants. As Mesa Verdeans increasingly relied on corn as a dietary staple, the success or failure of crop yields factored heavily into their lives. The mesa tilts slightly to the south, which increased its exposure to the sun. Before the introduction of pottery, foods were baked, roasted, and parched. Hot rocks dropped into containers could bring water to a brief boil, but because beans must be boiled for an hour or more their use was not widespread until after pottery had disseminated throughout the region. With the increased availability of ceramics after 600, beans became much easier to cook. This provided a high quality protein that reduced reliance on hunting. It also aided corn cultivation, as legumes add much needed nutrients to soils they are grown in, which likely increased corn yields. Most Mesa Verdeans practiced dry farming, which relied on rain to water their crops, but others utilized runoff, springs, seeps, and natural collection pools. Starting in the 9th century, they dug and maintained reservoirs that caught runoff from summer showers and spring snowmelt; some crops were watered by hand. Archaeologists believe that prior to the 13th century, springs and other sources of water were considered shared public resources, but as Mesa Verdeans moved into increasingly larger pueblos built near or around water supplies control was privatized and limited to members of the surrounding community. Between 750 and 800, Mesa Verdeans began constructing two large water containment structures in canyon bottoms ‚Äì the Morefield and Box Elder reservoirs. Soon afterward, work began on two more: the Far View and Sagebrush reservoirs, which were approximately across and constructed on the mesa top. The reservoirs lie on an east‚Äìwest line that runs for approximately , which suggests builders followed a centralized plan for the system. In 2004, the American Society of Civil Engineers designated these four structures as National Civil Engineering Historic Landmarks. A 2014 geospatial analyses suggested that neither collection nor retention of water was possible in the Far View Reservoir. This interpretation views the structure as a ceremonial space with procession roads in an adaptation of Chacoan culture. Hunting and foraging Ancestral Puebloan bone awls Mesa Verdeans typically harvested local small game, but sometimes organized hunting parties that traveled long distances. Their main sources of animal protein came from mule deer and rabbits, but they occasionally hunted Bighorn sheep, antelope, and elk. They began to domesticate turkeys starting around 1000, and by the 13th century consumption of the animal peaked, supplanting deer as the primary protein source at many sites. These domesticated turkeys consumed large amounts of corn, which further deepened reliance on the staple crop. Puebloans wove blankets from turkey feathers and rabbit fur, and made implements such as awls and needles from turkey and deer bones. Despite the availability of fish in the area's rivers and streams, archaeological evidence suggests that they were rarely eaten. Mesa Verdeans supplemented their diet by gathering the seeds and fruits of wild plants, searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources. Depending on the season, they collected pi√±on nuts and juniper berries, weedy goosefoot, pigweed, purslane, tomatillo, tansy mustard, globe mallow, sunflower seeds, and yucca, as well as various species of grass and cacti. Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar. Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge. They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany, along with pi√±on and juniper, for firewood. They also smoked wild tobacco. Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred, their midden piles were viewed with reverence. Starting during the Basketmaker III period, , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds. Pottery Scholars are divided as to whether pottery was invented in the Four Corners region or introduced from the south. Specimens of shallow, unfired clay bowls found at Canyon de Chelly indicate the innovation might have been derived from using clay bowls to parch seeds. Repeated uses rendered these bowls hard and impervious to water, which might represent the first fired pottery in the region. An alternate theory suggests that pottery originated in the Mogollon Rim area to the south, where brown-paste bowls were used during the first few centuries of the common era. Others believe pottery was introduced to Mesa Verde from Mexico, CE. There is no evidence of ancient pottery markets in the region, but archaeologists believe that local potters exchanged decorative wares between families. Cooking pots made with crushed igneous rock tempers from places like Ute Mountain were more resilient and desirable, and Puebloans from throughout the region traded for them. Neutron activation analysis indicates that much of the black-on-white pottery found at Mesa Verde was produced locally. Cretaceous clays from both the Dakota and Menefee Formations were used in black-on-white wares, and Mancos Formation clays for corrugated jars. Evidence that pottery of both types moved between several locations around the region suggests interaction between groups of ancient potters, or they might have shared a common source of raw materials. The Mesa Verde black- on-white pottery was produced at three locations: Sand Canyon, Castle Rock, and Mesa Verde. Archeological evidence indicates that nearly every household had at least one member who worked as a potter. Trench kilns were constructed away from pueblos and closer to sources of firewood. Their sizes vary, but the larger ones were up to long and thought to have been shared kilns that served several families. Designs were added to ceramic vessels with a Yucca-leaf brush and paints made from iron, manganese, beeplant, and tansy mustard. Most of the pottery found in 9th century pueblos was sized for individuals or small families, but as communal ceremonialism expanded during the 13th century, many larger, feast‚Äìsized vessels were produced. Corrugated decorations appear on Mesa Verde grey wares after 700, and by 1000 entire vessels were crafted in this way. The technique created a rough exterior surface that was easier to hold on to than regular gray wares, which were smooth. By the 11th century these corrugated vessels, which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones, had largely replaced the older style, whose tendency to retain heat made them prone to boiling over. Corrugation likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry. Corrugated wares were made using clay from formations other than Menefee, which suggests that ancient potters selected different clays for different styles. Potters also selected clays and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors. Under normal conditions, pots made of Mancos shale turned grey when fired, and those made of Morrison Formation clay turned white. Clays from southeastern Utah turned red when fired in a high-oxygen environment. Rock art and murals Mesa Verde's Petroglyph Point; the glyphs represent (top; from right to left) the Eagle, Mountain Sheep, Parrot, Horned Toad, and Mountain Lion clans, and the Ancestral Puebloans (bottom). Rock art is found throughout the Mesa Verde region, but its dispersion is uneven and periodic. Some locations have numerous examples; others have none, and some periods saw prolific creation, while others saw little. Styles also vary over time. Examples are relatively rare on Mesa Verde proper, but abundant in the middle San Juan River area, which might indicate the river's importance as a travel route and key source of water. Common motifs in the rock art of the region include, anthropomorphic figures in procession and during copulation or childbirth, handprints, animal and people tracks, wavy lines, spirals, concentric circles, animals, and hunting scenes. As the region's population plummeted during the late 13th century, the subject of Mesa Verdean rock art increasingly shifted to depictions of shields, warriors, and battle scenes. Modern Hopi have interpreted the petroglyphs at Mesa Verde's Petroglyph Point as depictions of various clans of people. Starting during the late Pueblo II period (1020) and continuing through Pueblo III (1300), the Ancestral Puebloans of the Mesa Verde region created plaster murals in their great houses, particularly in their kivas. The murals contained both painted and inscribed images depicting animals, people, and designs used in textiles and pottery dating back as far as Basketmaker III, . Others depict triangles and mounds thought to represent mountains and hills in the surrounding landscape. The murals were typically located on the face of the kiva bench and usually encircled the room. Geometric patterns that resemble symbols used in pottery and zigzag that represent stitches used in basket making are common motifs. The painted murals include the colors red, green, yellow, white, brown, and blue. The designs were still in use by the Hopi during the 15th and 16th centuries. Climate According to the K√∂ppen climate classification system, Mesa Verde National Park has a Warm Summer Humid continental climate (Dfb). According to the United States Department of Agriculture, the Plant Hardiness zone at Mesa Verde National Park Headquarters at 6952 ft (2119 m) elevation is 6b with an average annual extreme minimum temperature of ‚àí0.1 ¬∞F (‚àí17.8 ¬∞C). The region's precipitation pattern is bimodal, meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer. Water for farming and consumption was provided by summer rains, winter snowfall, and seeps and springs in and near the Mesa Verde villages. At , the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees Fahrenheit (5.5 ¬∞C) cooler than the mesa top, which reduced the amount of water needed for farming. The cliff dwellings were built to take advantage of solar energy. The angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff dwellings, warm breezes blew from the valley, and the air was ten to twenty degrees warmer in the canyon alcoves than on the top of the mesa. In the summer, with the sun high overhead, much of the village was protected from direct sunlight in the high cliff dwellings. Anthropogenic ecology and geography Anthropogenic ecology refers to the human impact on animals and plants in an ecosystem. A shift from medium and large game animals, such as deer, bighorn sheep, and antelope, to smaller ones like rabbits and turkey during the mid-10th to mid-13th centuries might indicate that Mesa Verdean subsistence hunting had dramatically altered faunal populations on the mesa. Analysis of pack rat midden indicates that, with the exception of invasive species such as tumbleweed and clover, the flora and fauna in the area have remained relatively consistent for the past 4,000 years. According to the A. W. Kuchler U.S. Potential natural vegetation Types, Mesa Verde National Park has a Juniper/Pinyon (23) potential vegetation type with a Great Basin montane forest /Southwest Forest (4) potential vegetation form. Mesa Verde's canyons were created by streams that eroded the hard sandstone that covers the area. This resulted in Mesa Verde National Park elevations ranging from about , the highest elevation at Park Point. The terrain in the park is now a transition zone between the low desert plateaus and the Rocky Mountains. Geology Although the area's first Spanish explorers named the feature Mesa Verde, the term is a misnomer, as true mesas are almost perfectly flat. Because Mesa Verde is slanted to the south, the proper geological term is cuesta, not mesa. The park is made up of several smaller cuestas located between canyons. Mesa Verde's slant contributed to the formation of the alcoves that have preserved the area's cliff dwellings. In the late Cretaceous Period, the Mancos Shale was deposited on top of the Dakota Sandstone, which is the rock formation that can be found under much of Colorado. The beds of the Mancos Shale are \\"fine-grained sand-stones, mudstones, and shales\\" which accumulated in the deep water of the Cretaceous Sea. It has a high clay content which causes it to expand when wet leading to sliding of the terrain. On top of this shale, there are three formations in the Mesaverde group which reflect the changes in depositional environment in the area over time. The first is the Point Lookout Sandstone, which is named for the Point Lookout feature in the park (elevation 8427 feet). This sandstone, which formed in the marine environment of shallow water when the Cretaceous sea was receding, is \\"massive, fine-grained, cross-bedded, and very resistant\\", in its layers reflecting waves and currents that were present during the time of its formation. Its sediments are approximately 400 feet thick, and its upper layers feature fossiliferous invertebrates. Next is the Menefee Formation, the middle formation whose content features interbedded carbonaceous shales, siltstones, and sandstones. These were deposited in semi- marine environments of brackish water, such as swamps and lagoons. Due to its depositional environment and the organic material in its composition, there are thin coal seams running through the Menefee Formation. At the top, this formation is intruded upon by the Cliff House Sandstone. The Cliff House Sandstone is the area's youngest rock layer. It was formed after the Cretaceous sea had completely receded and as a result has a high sand content from beaches, dunes, etc. and from this receives its characteristic yellow tint to its canyon faces. Like the Point Lookout Sandstone, it is about 400 feet thick. It contains numerous fossil beds of different types of shells, fish teeth, and other invertebrate leftovers from the receded sea. The shale zones in this feature determine where alcoves formed where the Ancestral Puebloans constructed their dwellings. Continuing through the Cretaceous period and into the early Tertiary, there was uplifting in the area of the Colorado Plateau, the San Juan Mountains, and the La Plata Mountains, which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion. Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel. Later in the tertiary, the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today. This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock. Today, since the climate is more arid, these erosional processes are slowed. Rediscovery Spruce Tree House Mexican-Spanish missionaries and explorers Francisco Atanasio Dom√≠nguez and Silvestre V√©lez de Escalante, seeking a route from Santa Fe to California, faithfully recorded their travels in 1776. They reached Mesa Verde (green plateau) region, which they named after its high, tree-covered plateaus, but they never got close enough, or into the needed angle, to see the ancient stone villages. They were the first white men to travel the route through much of the Colorado Plateau into Utah and back through Arizona to New Mexico. The Mesa Verde region has long been occupied by the Utes, and an 1868 treaty between them and the United States government recognized Ute ownership of all Colorado land west of the Continental Divide. After there had become an interest in land in western Colorado, a new treaty in 1873 left the Ute with a strip of land in southwestern Colorado between the border with New Mexico and 15 miles north. Most of Mesa Verde lies within this strip of land. The Ute wintered in the warm, deep canyons and found sanctuary there and the high plateaus of Mesa Verde. Believing the cliff dwellings to be sacred ancestral sites, they did not live in the ancient dwellings. Occasional trappers and prospectors visited, with one prospector, John Moss, making his observations known in 1873. The following year, Moss led eminent photographer William Henry Jackson through Mancos Canyon, at the base of Mesa Verde. There, Jackson both photographed and publicized a typical stone cliff dwelling. Geologist William H. Holmes retraced Jackson's route in 1875. Reports by both Jackson and Holmes were included in the 1876 report of the Hayden Survey, one of the four federally financed efforts to explore the American West. These and other publications led to proposals to systematically study Southwestern archaeological sites. In her quest to find Ancestral Puebloan settlements, Virginia McClurg, a journalist for the New York Daily Graphic, visited Mesa Verde in 1882 and 1885. Her party rediscovered Echo Cliff House, Three Tier House, and Balcony House in 1885; these discoveries inspired her to protect the dwellings and artifacts. =Wetherills= A family of cattle ranchers, the Wetherills, befriended members of the Ute tribe near their ranch southwest of Mancos, Colorado. With the Ute tribe's approval, the Wetherills were allowed to bring cattle into the lower, warmer plateaus of the present Ute reservation during winter. Word of the Ancestral Puebloan great houses had spread, and Acowitz, a member of the Ute tribe, told the Wetherills of a special cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde: \\"Deep in that canyon and near its head are many houses of the old people ‚Äì the Ancient Ones. One of those houses, high, high in the rocks, is bigger than all the others. Utes never go there, it is a sacred place.\\" On December 18, 1888, Richard Wetherill and cowboy Charlie Mason rediscovered Cliff Palace after spotting the ruins from the top of Mesa Verde. Wetherill gave the ruin its present-day name. Richard Wetherill, family and friends explored the ruins and gathered artifacts, some of which they sold to the Historical Society of Colorado and much of which they kept. Among the people who stayed with the Wetherills and explored the cliff dwellings was mountaineer, photographer, and author Frederick H. Chapin, who visited the region during 1889 and 1890. He described the landscape and ruins in an 1890 article and later in an 1892 book, The Land of the Cliff-Dwellers, which he illustrated with hand-drawn maps and personal photographs. =Gustaf Nordenski√∂ld= Cliff Palace in 1891, by Gustaf Nordenski√∂ld The Wetherills also hosted Gustaf Nordenski√∂ld, the son of polar explorer Adolf Erik Nordenski√∂ld, in 1891. Nordenski√∂ld was a trained mineralogist who introduced scientific methods to artifact collection, recorded locations, photographed extensively, diagrammed sites, and correlated what he observed with existing archaeological literature as well as the home-grown expertise of the Wetherills. He removed a lot of artifacts and sent them to Sweden, where they eventually went to the National Museum of Finland. Nordenski√∂ld published, in 1893, The Cliff Dwellers of the Mesa Verde. When Nordenski√∂ld shipped the collection that he made of Mesa Verde artifacts, the event initiated concerns about the need to protect Mesa Verde land and its resources. National park Park map In 1889, Goodman Point Pueblo became the first pre-Columbian archaeological site in the Mesa Verde region to gain federal protection. It was the first such site to be protected in the US. Virginia McClurg was diligent in her efforts between 1887 and 1906 to inform the United States and European community of the importance of protecting the important historical material and dwellings in Mesa Verde. Her efforts included enlisting support from 250,000 women through the Federation of Women's Clubs, writing and having published poems in popular magazines, giving speeches domestically and internationally, and forming the Colorado Cliff Dwellers Association. The Colorado Cliff Dwellers' purpose was to protect the resources of Colorado cliff dwellings, reclaiming as much of the original artifacts as possible and sharing information about the people who dwelt there. A fellow activist for protection of Mesa Verde and prehistoric archaeological sites included Lucy Peabody, who, located in Washington, D.C., met with members of Congress to further the cause. Former Mesa Verde National Park superintendent Robert Heyder communicated his belief that the park might have been far more significant with the hundreds of artifacts taken by Nordenski√∂ld. Jesse Walter Fewkes at Mesa Verde cliff dwellings, Mesa Verde National Park, 1917 By the end of the 19th century, it was clear that Mesa Verde needed protection from people in general who came to Mesa Verde and created or sold their own collection of artifacts. In a report to the Secretary of the Interior, Smithsonian Institution Ethnologist Jesse Walter Fewkes described vandalism at Mesa Verde's Cliff Palace: Many artifacts from Mesa Verde are now located in museums and private collections in the US and across the world. A representative selection of pottery vessels and other objects, for example, is now in the British Museum in London. In 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt approved creation of the Mesa Verde National Park and the Federal Antiquities Act of 1906. The park was an effort to \\"preserve the works of man\\" and was the first park created to protect a location of cultural significance. The park was named with the Spanish term for green table because of its forests of juniper and pi√±on trees. =Excavation and protection= Between 1908 and 1922, Spruce Tree House, Cliff Palace, and Sun Temple ruins were stabilised. Most of the early efforts were led by Jesse Walter Fewkes. During the 1930s and 40s, Civilian Conservation Corps workers, starting in 1932, played key roles in excavation efforts, building trails and roads, creating museum exhibits and constructing buildings at Mesa Verde. From 1958 to 1965, Wetherill Mesa Archaeological Project included archaeological excavations, stabilization of sites, and surveys. With excavation and study of eleven Wetherill Mesa sites, it is considered the largest archaeological effort in the US. The project oversaw the excavation of Long House and Mug House. In 1966, as with all historical areas administered by the National Park Service, Mesa Verde was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and in 1987, the Mesa Verde Administrative District was listed on the register. It was designated a World Heritage Site in 1978. In its 2015 travel awards, Sunset magazine named Mesa Verde National Park \\"the best cultural attraction\\" in the Western United States. = Conflicts with local tribes = Clashes between non-Indigenous environmentalists and local tribes surrounding the ruins at Mesa Verde began even before the park's official establishment. Conflicts over who laid claim to the land surrounding the ruins came to fruition in 1911, when the US government wanted to secure more land for the park that was owned by the Ute Indians. The Utes were reluctant to agree to the land swap proposed by the government, noting that the land they were seeking was the best land the tribe owned. Frederick Abbott, working with Indian Office official James McLaughlin, proclaimed to be an ally to the Ute in negotiations. Abbott later claimed that the \\"government was stronger than the Utes,\\" saying that when the government finds \\"old ruins on land that it wants to take for public purposes, it has the right to take it ...\\" Feeling they were left with no other options, the Utes reluctantly agreed to trade the 10,000 acres on Chapin Mesa for 19,500 acres on Ute Mountain. The Utes continued to battle the Bureau of Indian Affairs to prevent more Ute land from being incorporated into the park. In 1935, the BIA attempted to gain back some the land traded in 1911. Additionally, superintendent Jesse L. Nusbaum later confessed that the Ute Mountain land traded for Chapin Mesa in 1911 belonged to the tribe anyway, meaning the government had traded land that never belonged to them in the first place. Other issues unrelated to land disputes emerged as a result of park activities. In the 1920s, the park began offering \\"Indian ceremony\\" performances that gained popularity among visiting tourists; however, the ceremonies did not actually reflect the rites of the Ancient Puebloans who lived in the cliff dwellings nor the rites of the modern Ute. Navajo day laborers performed these rituals, resulting in \\"the wrong Indians doing the wrong dance on ... the wrong land.\\" In addition to the inaccuracy of the ceremonies, a question of whether Navajo dancers were paid fairly also resulted in questions regarding the lack of local American Indians being employed in other capacities in the park. Additionally, the park offered little financial benefits to the Ute Mountain Ute despite their land swap making much of the park possible. =Services= Park Ranger leading a tour at Mesa Verde National Park The entrance to Mesa Verde National Park is on U.S. Route 160, approximately east of the community of Cortez and west of Mancos, Colorado. The park covers It contains 4,372 documented sites, including more than 600 cliff dwellings.: 4,372 documented sites; : 600 cliff dwellings. It is the largest archaeological preserve in the US. It protects some of the most important and best-preserved archaeological sites in the country. The park initiated the Archaeological Site Conservation Program in 1995. It analyses data pertaining to how sites are constructed and utilized. The Mesa Verde Visitor and Research Center is located just off of Highway 160 and is before the park entrance booths. The Visitor and Research Center opened in December 2012. Chapin Mesa (the most popular area) is beyond the visitor center.Mesa Verde Trip Planner.

Three of the cliff dwellings on Chapin Mesa are open to the public. The Chapin Mesa Museum is open all year. Spruce Tree House is also open all year, weather permitting. Balcony House, Long House and Cliff Palace require tour tickets for ranger-guided tours. Many other dwellings are visible from the road but not open to tourists. The park offers hiking trails, a campground, and, during peak season, facilities for food, fuel, and lodging; these are unavailable in the winter. The park's early administrative buildings, located on Chapin Mesa, form an architecturally significant complex of buildings. Built in the 1920s, the Mesa Verde administrative complex was one of the first examples of the Park Service using culturally appropriate design in the development of park facilities. The area was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 1987. and =Wildfires and culturally modified trees= Wildfire damage on Chapin Mesa During the years 1996 to 2003, the park suffered from several wildfires.Mesa Verde Fire History. Mesa Verde National Park Retrieved September 24, 2011 The fires, many of which were started by lightning during times of drought, burned of forest, more than half the park. The fires also damaged many archaeological sites and park buildings. They were named: Chapin V (1996), Bircher and Pony (2000), Long Mesa (2002), and the Balcony House Complex fires (2003), which were five fires that began on the same day. The Chapin V and Pony fires destroyed two rock art sites, and the Long Mesa fire nearly destroyed the museum ‚Äì the first one ever built in the National Park System ‚Äì and Spruce Tree House, the third largest cliff dwelling in the park. Prior to the fires of 1996 to 2003, archaeologists had surveyed approximately ninety percent of the park. Dense undergrowth and tree cover kept many ancient sites hidden from view, but after the Chapin V, Bircher and Pony fires, 593 previously undiscovered sites were revealed ‚Äì most of them date to the Basketmaker III and Pueblo I periods. Also uncovered during the fires were extensive water containment features, including 1,189 check dams, 344 terraces, and five reservoirs that date to the Pueblo II and III periods. In February 2008, the Colorado Historical Society decided to invest a part of its $7 million budget into a culturally modified trees project in the national park.State Historical Fund awards more than $7M in grants, Denver Business Journal, Feb 14, 2008. =Ute Mountain Tribal Park= The Ute Mountain Tribal Park, adjoining Mesa Verde National Park to the east of the mountains, is approximately along the Mancos River. Hundreds of surface sites, cliff dwellings, petroglyphs, and wall paintings of Ancestral Puebloan and Ute cultures are preserved in the park. Native American Ute tour guides provide background information about the people, culture, and history of the park lands.

Examples open to public access include the Far View Complex and Cedar Tree Tower on Chapin Mesa, and Badger House Community, on Wetherill Mesa. =Balcony House= Emmett Harryson, a Navajo, at a T-shaped doorway at Balcony House (1929) Balcony House is set on a high ledge facing east. Its 45 rooms and 2 kivas would have been cold during the winter. Visitors on ranger-guided tours enter by climbing a 32-foot ladder and a crawling through a 12-foot tunnel. The exit, a series of toe-holds in a cleft of the cliff, was believed to be the only entry and exit route for the cliff dwellers, which made the small village easy to defend and secure. One log was dated at 1278, so it was likely built not long before the Mesa Verde people migrated out of the area. It was officially excavated in 1910 by Jesse L. Nusbaum, who was the first National Park Service Archeologist and one of the first Superintendents of Mesa Verde National Park.https://www.nps.gov/archeology/SITES/dcaPdfs/BriefBioJNusbaum.pdf Visitors can enter Balcony House through ranger-guided tours. =Cliff Palace= left This multi-storied ruin, the best-known cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde, is located in the largest alcove in the center of the Great Mesa. It was south- and southwest-facing, providing greater warmth from the sun in the winter. Dating back more than 700 years, the dwelling is constructed of sandstone, wooden beams, and mortar.Cliff House Visit Mesa Verde Retrieved October 16, 2011 Many of the rooms were brightly painted. Cliff Palace was home to approximately 125 people, but was likely an important part of a larger community of sixty nearby pueblos, which housed a combined six hundred or more people. With 23 kivas and 150 rooms, Cliff Palace is the largest cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde National Park. =Long House= thumb Located on the Wetherill Mesa, Long House is the second-largest Mesa Verdean village; approximately 150 people lived there. The location was excavated from 1959 through 1961, as part of the Wetherhill Mesa Archaeological Project. Long House was built ; it was occupied until 1280. The cliff dwelling features 150 rooms, a kiva, a tower, and a central plaza. Its rooms are not clustered like typical cliff dwellings. Stones were used without shaping for fit and stability. Two overhead ledges contain storage space for grain. One ledge seems to include an overlook with small holes in the wall to see the rest of the village below. A spring is accessible within several hundred feet, and seeps are located in the rear of the village. =Mug, Oak Tree, Spruce Tree, and Square Tower houses= Mug House is located on Wetherill Mesa; it contains 94 rooms, a large kiva, and a nearby reservoir. It received its name from four mugs the Charles Mason and the Wetherill brothers found strung together at the site. Oak Tree House and neighboring Fire Temple can be visited via a 2-hour ranger-guided hike. Spruce Tree House is the third-largest village, within several hundred feet of a spring, and had 130 rooms and eight kivas. It was constructed sometime between 1211 and 1278. It is believed anywhere from 60 to 80 people lived there at one time. Because of its protective location, it is well preserved. The short trail to Spruce Tree House begins at the Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum. The Square Tower House is one of the stops on the Mesa Top Loop Road driving tour. The tower is the tallest structure in Mesa Verde.

On This Old House, Vila appeared with carpenter Norm Abram as they, and others, renovated houses. In 1989, he left the show following a disagreement arising from his involvement with outside commercial endorsements for New Jersey-based Rickel, and the subsequent retaliatory pulling of underwriting by Rickel's competitor Home Depot and lumber supplier Weyerhaeuser.The Modesto Bee ‚Äì Google News Archive Search He was replaced by Steve Thomas. After leaving This Old House, Vila became a commercial spokesman for Sears, and beginning in 1990 he hosted Bob Vila's Home Again, (renamed to simply Bob Vila in 2005), a weekly syndicated home-improvement program. His series ran for 16 seasons in syndication before it was canceled by distributor CBS Television Distribution due to declining ratings; the series remains in reruns. From 1989 onward, Bob Vila appeared in Sears commercials to promote the Craftsman tools brand. The partnership broke down in 2006, after a dispute between him and the company. Vila also appeared on various episodes of the situation comedy Home Improvement as himself on \\"Tool Time\\", the fictional show within the sitcom, where main character and cable TV host Tim Taylor (played by Tim Allen) saw him as a rival and made futile attempts to outdo Vila. Contrary to Home Improvement, when Allen was interviewed by Nintendo Power and asked if he could make a video game, Allen proposed one about aspects of carpentry, and the end scene would be the player being featured on Bob Vila's Home Again. Vila also made a cameo in the 1993 comedy spoof Hot Shots! Part Deux. Vila has written 10 books, including a five-book series titled Bob Vila's Guide to Historic Homes of America. As of 2016, Bob Vila still appears regularly on television. He can also be seen on the Home Shopping Network, selling a range of tools under his own name brand that he founded in 2016.

Both are derived from Donald Knuth's Metafont language and interpreter. MetaPost produces vector graphic diagrams from a geometric/algebraic description. The language shares Metafont's declarative syntax for manipulating lines, curves, points and geometric transformations. However, * Metafont is set up to produce fonts, in the form of image files (in .gf format) with associated font metric files (in .tfm format), whereas MetaPost produces EPS, SVG, or PNG files * The output of Metafont consists of the fonts at a fixed resolution in a raster-based format, whereas MetaPost's output is vector-based graphics (lines, B√©zier curves) * Metafont output is monochrome, whereas MetaPost uses RGB or CMYK colors. * The MetaPost language can include text labels on the diagrams, either strings from a specified font, or anything else that can be typeset with TeX. * Starting with version 1.8, Metapost allows floating-point arithmetic with 64 bits (default: 32 bit fixed- point arithmetic) Many of the limitations of MetaPost derive from features of Metafont. For instance, MetaPost does not support all features of PostScript. Most notably, paths can have only one segment (so that regions are simply connected), and regions can be filled only with uniform colours. PostScript level 1 supports tiled patterns and PostScript 3 supports Gouraud shading. Availability and usage MetaPost is distributed with many distributions of the TeX and Metafont framework, for example, it is included in the MiKTeX and the TeX Live distributions. The encapsulated postscript produced by Metapost can be included in LaTeX, ConTeXt, and TeX documents via standard graphics inclusion commands. The encapsulated postscript output can also be used with the PDFTeX engine, thus directly giving PDF. This ability is implemented in ConTeXt and in the LaTeX graphics package, and can be used from plain TeX via the supp-pdf.tex macro file.

Where different manuscripts conflict on a particular reading, the principle suggests that the more unusual one is more likely the original. The presupposition is that scribes would more often replace odd words and hard sayings with more familiar and less controversial ones, than vice versa.Maurice A. Robinson, \\"New Testament Textual Criticism: The Case for Byzantine Priority\\", 2001. It will readily be seen that lectio difficilior potior is an internal criterion, which is independent of criteria for evaluating the manuscript in which it is found, and that it is as applicable to manuscripts of a roman courtois or a classical poet as it is to a biblical text. The principle was one among a number that became established in early 18th-century text criticism, as part of attempts by scholars of the Enlightenment to provide a neutral basis for discovering an urtext that was independent of the weight of traditional authority. History According to Paolo Trovato who cites as source Sebastiano Timpanaro, the principle was first mentioned by Jean Leclerc in 1696 in his Ars critica.Page 117 in Trovato, P. (2014).

It was also laid down by Johann Albrecht Bengel, in his Prodromus Novi Testamenti Graeci Rect√® Caut√®que Adornandi, 1725, and employed in his Novum Testamentum Graecum, 1734.Noted in an observation by Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener in A Plain Introduction to the Criticism of the New testament (E. Miller, ed. 1894:vol. ii, p. 247) by W.L. Lorimer, \\"\\"Lectio Difficilior\\", The Classical Review 48.5 (November 1934:171). It was widely promulgated by Johann Jakob Wettstein to whom it is often attributed.E.g. by H. J. Rose in The Classical Review 48 (126 note 2, corrected by Lorimer 1934. Usefulness Many scholars considered the employment of lectio difficilior potior an objective criterion that would even override other evaluative considerations.Tov 1982:432. The poet and scholar A.E. Housman challenged such reactive applications in 1922, in the provocatively-titled article \\"The Application of Thought to Textual Criticism\\".Proceedings of the Classical Association 18 (1922), pp67-84. On the other hand, taken as an axiom, the principle lectio difficilior produces an eclectic text, rather than one based on a history of manuscript transmission. \\"Modern eclectic praxis operates on a variant unit basis without any apparent consideration of the consequences\\", Maurice A. Robinson warned. He suggested that to the principle \\"should be added a corollary, difficult readings created by individual scribes do not tend to perpetuate in any significant degree within transmissional history\\".Robinson 2001 A noted proponent of the superiority of the Byzantine text-type, the form of the Greek New Testament in the largest number of surviving manuscripts, Robinson would use the corollary to explain differences from the Majority Text as scribal errors that were not perpetuated because they were known to be errant or because they existed only in a small number of manuscripts at the time. Most textual-critical scholars would explain the corollary by the assumption that scribes tended to \\"correct\\" harder readings and so cut off the stream of transmission. Thus, only earlier manuscripts would have the harder readings. Later manuscripts would not see the corollary principle as being a very important one to get closer to the original form of the text. However, lectio difficilior is not to be taken as an absolute rule either but as a general guideline. \\"In general the more difficult reading is to be preferred\\" is Bruce Metzger's reservation.Italics supplied. Bruce Metzger, The Text of the New Testament, II.i.1, p. 209 \\"There is truth in the maxim: lectio difficilior lectio potior ('the more difficult reading is the more probable reading')\\", write Kurt and Barbara Aland.Aland, The Text of the New Testament, pp. 275-276; the Alands' twelve basic principles of textual criticism are reported on-line. However, for scholars like Kurt Aland who follow a path of reasoned eclecticism that is based on evidence both internal and external to the manuscripts, \\"this principle must not be taken too mechanically, with the most difficult reading (lectio difficillima) adopted as original simply because of its degree of difficulty\\".Aland 1995, p. 276. Also, Martin Litchfield West cautions, \\"When we choose the 'more difficult reading'... we must be sure that it is in itself a plausible reading. The principle should not be used in support of dubious syntax, or phrasing that it would not have been natural for the author to use. There is an important difference between a more difficult reading and a more unlikely reading\\".West 1973, p. 51.

Vision (known simply as ADV and also referred to as ADV Films) was an American multimedia entertainment studio that served as the largest American and British anime distributor in the late 20th to early 21st centuries. Headquartered in Houston, Texas, ADV Films was formed in 1992 by video game fan John Ledford and anime fans Matt Greenfield and David Williams. The company spent the next 17 years in the fields of home video production and distribution, broadcast television, theatrical film distribution, merchandising, original productions, magazine and comic book publishing. In 2002, most of ADV Films' back catalog were used to program its new channel, the Anime Network. For over 15 years, ADV released successful anime titles. Among them are Neon Genesis Evangelion, Robotech, RahXephon, Full Metal Panic, Azumanga Daioh, Elfen Lied, Gantz, Red Garden and Le Chevalier D'Eon. The company maintained offices in North America, Europe and Asia. In addition to North America, ADV Films distributed their home media releases in the United Kingdom, Italy, and Germany. With declining fortunes in the mid-2000s due to low sales, ADV collapsed and eventually liquidated their assets in 2009. Section23 Films, Sentai Filmworks, AEsir Holdings, Valkyrie Media Partners and Seraphim Digital; which became subsidiaries of AEsir Media. Ledford, Greenfield and Williams continue to work for these companies as mentors and creative consultants and most of ADV's back catalog were re-licensed by Discotek Media, Media Blasters, Sentai Filmworks, Maiden Japan, Nozomi Entertainment, Viz Media, Aniplex of America and Funimation. As of 2020, in addition to owning the rights to the ADV Films brand name, Sentai Filmworks now distributes later releases such as Mezzo DSA on DVD, Kino's Journey on DVD and SD Blu-ray, Elfen Lied on DVD and Blu-ray, and Lady Death: The Movie on Blu-ray.  History  The former A.D. Vision building at the Plaza Southwest complex in Greater Sharpstown, Houston, Texas, seen in a 2009 photograph. John Ledford, a native of Houston, Texas, started a Japanese video game and video console import business in 1990. He was introduced to anime when he watched My Neighbor Totoro at his friend's suggestion. At the time, Matt Greenfield, born in Sacramento, California, ran a local anime club called Anime NASA, which also included classmate David Williams. After consulting with Ledford, Greenfield joined him and Williams to found A.D. Vision, which officially opened for business on August 17, 1992. Ledford contacted Toho about optioning the rights to license Devil Hunter Yohko. Shozo Watanabe, the general manager of Toho's Los Angeles office, expressed concern that A.D. Vision would not be able to handle the distribution of the film. Unable to find another distributor, Toho convinced A.D. Vision to license the series. That December, Devil Hunter Yohko became the first title to be released by A.D. Vision. In 2007, Japan's Sojitz announced that Japan Content Investments (JCI), an investment group run by Sojitz, Development Bank of Japan, and film distribution company KlockWorx, planned to contribute money to A.D. Vision, in return for equity in the company. Ledford was to remain the majority shareholder and CEO. JCI subsidiary ARM also planned to contribute money for ADV to use in acquiring new distribution licenses. The investment was to ADV Films to raise its output of new anime titles, which had dropped in 2006, back to previous levels or above. In return, ADV planned to assist Sojitz with the acquisition of North American and European content for importation into Japan. According to ADV, they also reportedly had \\"big plans\\" for its manga line. = Distribution of Geneon properties = In August 2007, a notice was sent to retailers stating that ADV Films would be taking over the distribution, marketing, and sales of Geneon properties in the US as of October 1. In preparation, Geneon United States laid off most of its sales division; however, in September the distribution deal was canceled. Dentsu confirmed that the distribution deal was canceled through a press release on September 21, 2007 with no reasons given except that Geneon and ADV were \\"unable to reach a mutual agreement.\\" = Sojitz partnership = In June 2006, ADV Films entered into a partnership with the Japanese Sojitz Corporation. This was done as a means of acquiring more titles in the Japanese market. From this point on, virtually all titles that ADV acquired were with Sojitz's help. However, in January 2008, ADV mysteriously removed a large number of titles from their website. All the titles removed were titles acquired since the Sojitz collaboration including Gurren Lagann, which had test disks sent out with dubbed episodes. As of May 2008, Gurren Lagann was licensed by Bandai Entertainment. ADV Films made booth appearances at the Anime Central 2008 convention, but they canceled their planned panel. In July 2008, Funimation announced the acquisition of thirty of these titles. The titles removed from ADV's website are as follows: 009-1, 5 Centimeters per Second, Ah! My Goddess: Flights of Fancy, both the film and television adaptions of the Key visual novel Air, Best Student Council, Blade of the Phantom Master, Comic Party Revolution, Coyote Ragtime Show, Devil May Cry, the 2006 live-action horror film Ghost Train, Guyver: The Bioboosted Armor, Innocent Venus, Jing King of Bandits: 7th Heaven, Jinki: Extend, the 2006 anime remake of yet another Key visual novel, Kanon, Kurau: Phantom Memory, Le Chevalier D'Eon, Magikano, Moeyo Ken, Moonlight Mile, Nerima Daikon Brothers, Pani Poni Dash!, Project Blue Earth SOS, Pumpkin Scissors, Red Garden, Tokyo Majin, UFO Princess Valkyrie, the first anime of Utawarerumono, Venus vs. Virus, The Wallflower, Welcome to the NHK and Xenosaga. = Sentai Filmworks partnership = On October 20, 2008, it was announced that ADV had entered into a licensing arrangement with new licensor Sentai Filmworks. The highlight of the new partnership was that ADV would be distributing the anime television adaptation of the popular visual novel Clannad, also they acquired the distribution rights to Koharu Biyori, Mahoromatic, Mahoromatic: Something More Beautiful (both were previously licensed by Geneon), Tsukihime (previously licensed by Geneon), Pet Shop of Horrors (previously licensed by Urban Vision), and Jewel BEM Hunter Lime (previously licensed by Media Blasters). After the dissolution of ADV, Section23 Films now has distribution rights for Sentai. =Central Park Media acquisitions= Following the May 2009 bankruptcy and liquidation of Central Park Media, ADV Films acquired the North American rights of Grave of the Fireflies and re-released it on DVD on July 7, 2009. This Studio Ghibli work was their only theatrical film whose North American distribution was not controlled by Disney until GKIDS' release of the 2011 film From Up on Poppy Hill. ADV Films also acquired the licenses of multiple other CPM titles as well. =Liquidation and dissolution= On September 1, 2009, ADV announced that it was liquidating its assets, including intellectual properties, its distribution arm and the Anime Network to four companies: Seraphim Studios, AEsir Holdings LLC, Valkyrie Media Partners LLC and SXION 23 LLC. The impact of this sale on the company's plans to license and release new titles, is still not fully known, but the ADV brand name and logo have been retired. Anime News Network has reported that Seraphim Studios, Valkyrie Media Partners and SXION 23 are all corporations registered (initially filed) by Griffin D. Vance IV, who was ADV's senior vice president of business and legal affairs. The following companies all acquired assets from A.D. Vision: * Sentai Filmworks is the licensor company for acquiring Japanese anime into the North American market. * AEsir Holdings has licensed rights to most of ADV Films' former library of titles (some titles are licensed directly by Sentai Filmworks). * Seraphim Studios acquired Amusement Park Media, ADV's production studio, and it was renamed Seraphim Digital Studios. * Valkyrie Media Partners acquired the Anime Network. The network continues to operate as before the sale. * Section23 Films is a distributor and marketing company of Switchblade Pictures, Sentai Filmworks, Maiden Japan, and AEsir Holdings. That day, major retail website Robert's Corner Anime Blog contacted Mike Bailiff, formerly of ADV Films and now heading up Sales and Marketing at Section 23 Films. Bailiff revealed that \\"Section 23 has acquired all of ADV's former licenses and most of the staff\\" including \\"everyone at ADV that mattered.\\" On September 18, 2009, the anime review site iSugoi.com posted a full podcast devoted to the shutdown of ADV, analyzing that ADV had not shut down and the new companies such as Section 23 were ADV selling itself to itself: that it was not a shutdown but a drastic rebranding and restructuring. The report went on to say that Section 23 was, for all intents and purposes, the direct successor- organization to the old ADV company name, and that ADV split its assets such as the Anime Network into the other three companies to take advantage of several legal loopholes. The podcast report concluded with the assertion that Section 23, and the umbrella of associated companies ADV split into, could effectively be thought of as Neo-ADV (referencing how in Mobile Suit Gundam, when the Principality of Zeon was defeated, its remnants reorganized into Neo Zeon). On October 15, 2009, rival distribution company Funimation posted an online Q&A; video panel hosted by events manager Adam Sheehan. When asked about ADV going out of business, Sheehan's response was the following: Ken Hoinsky, Managing Founder of MX Media LLC, a translation and localization company contracting with most major anime distribution companies (FUNimation, Viz, Bandai), appeared on the October 29, 2009, Anime News Network podcast: in it he said that his company also contracts with Section 23, but that he also collectively refers to the allied companies that ADV split into as Neo-ADV. Another new company associated with Sentai Filmworks is \\"Maiden Japan\\". While Sentai Filmworks is responsible for licensing new titles, both Section 23 and Maiden Japan serve as distributors for it. Since ADV's fire sale, Ledford, Greenfield and Williams moved on to work for new projects at Section 23 and Maiden Japan, respectively. Technically, Maiden Japan is \\"associated\\" with Switchblade Pictures. = Gainax lawsuit = In August 2011, A.D. Vision sued Gainax over Gainax's refusal to accept an option payment for the perpetual live-action rights to Evangelion, including the planned live-action film; ADV charges that by refusing to accept payment, Gainax broke the contract and is asking for the rights and legal fees.  Divisions  = ADV Films = ADV Films was the home video publication arm of A.D. Vision based in Houston, Texas, specializing in publishing anime and tokusatsu videos, as well as other live-action material. In 1996, ADV Films opened its UK division, and diversified into the realm of live-action television series, such as Andromeda, and Japanese films. The first title to be licensed and released to video was Devil Hunter Yohko. They were the first North American anime licensee to use all-digital video mastering and transfer (specifically D2 digital video tape), and soon began acquiring an extensive library of titles. Initially, titles were released to video with the original Japanese language track and English subtitles added. A few years later, they began dubbing releases to English using their own voice actors. ADV started out using a nearby production studio as their recording facility, but after a few years they were able to open up their own production and recording facility in Houston, as well as a second studio in Austin, Texas. The studios were named Industrial Smoke & Mirrors (IS&M;) and Monster Island, respectively. Monster Island closed down permanently in early 2005 and IS&M; became known simply as ADV Studios. In their later years, ADV Studios began offering their services for other companies, which led to their name being changed to Amusement Park Media. ADV Films offered a program called Anime ADVocates, which provided free screening material and other promotional content to nearly 3,000 anime clubs in North America. To qualify for the program, the club had to be sponsored by a local high school, college, university, or public library and have at least 10 members. Member clubs were also asked to participate in surveys about the content they received. However, in November 2007, ADV Films put the program on hiatus, then on January 18, 2008, ADV Films announced that the program was being suspended indefinitely due to amount of resources the program needed. The company continued to offer anime clubs screening permission for its titles prior to its reorganization. In July 2008, ADV Films and ARM Corporation transferred the licenses to over 30 different shows into the hands of fellow anime distributor Funimation. Those rights included the home video, broadcast, digital, and merchandising rights in North America and other regions. Since then, former ADV titles have since been re-licensed by other companies such as Funimation, Aniplex of America, Sentai Filmworks, Media Blasters, Discotek Media, Nozomi Entertainment, Maiden Japan, and Viz Media. Today, the ADV Films brand name is owned by Sentai Filmworks. = Anime Network = Anime Network was a cable channel in North America dedicated to anime. The network launched in North America in late 2002 and was marketed to multi-system operators (MSOs) as both a stand-alone 24-hour linear network and as a VOD programming service. The Anime Network was the United States' first all-anime cable TV network. On January 4, 2008, Anime Network officially announced that the traditional 24/7 service would cease operations. The Anime Network exists now as a web site with an Online Player and user forums, as well as a VOD channel operating on many cable and satellite operators, including DirecTV, Dish Network, Cox, Time Warner, Cablevision, Charter and many more. The network carried a variety of older ADV titles including Ushio and Tora, Rahxephon, Angelic Layer and more, in addition to many new shows from Sentai Filmworks including Clannad, Clannad After Story, Appleseed, Special A, Tears to Tiara, Sin: The Movie and many more. Anime Network also airs many shows from Right Stuf International's Nozomi division, such as Maria Watches Over Us and Aria, as well as many titles from Enoki Films, including Revolutionary Girl Utena, Demon Lord Dante, and Cosmic Warrior Zero. The network's website does not currently stream the Right Stuf titles, but all of the Enoki shows are available on its online player. Anime Network also carries Japanese films as well, apart from anime. = ADV Manga = ADV Manga was ADV's division for the licensing and distribution of English translations of Japanese manga. The division was launched in 2003, with a strong list of titles and an ambitious plan for growth within the United States manga market. However, ADV Manga canceled many of their titles in late 2004 and 2005. In late 2005, they began a more scaled-back release, concentrating on monthly released of a few titles, as well as releasing several acclaimed one-shots. In 2006, ADV Manga released the 6-volume Neon Genesis Evangelion: Angelic Days series and in 2007 the company resumed releasing several popular titles that had been on hiatus, including Yotsuba&! and Gunslinger Girl. At Anime Expo 2006, manga publisher Tokyopop announced that it had obtained the licenses for three titles formerly licensed by ADV that had been cancelled: Aria, Tactics, and Peacemaker Kurogane. Meanwhile, Yen Press has acquired the rights to Yotsuba&! and Azumanga Daioh. = ADV Music = ADV Music was the music publishing division which focused on distributing anime and movie soundtracks. Launched in 2003 after ending their partnership with The Right Stuf International in AnimeTrax, their initial releases included the soundtracks for Super Atragon, Cat Girl Nuku Nuku and Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny. = ADV Pro = ADV Pro was the company's anime production studio. They worked on such in house productions as Lady Death and Mutineers' Moon. John Ledford stated that ADV Pro had been \\"reactivated\\" and was working on Mutineers' Moon, however, with the shutdown at ADV Films, this plan has been cancelled. = SoftCel Pictures = SoftCel Pictures was the branch of the company that specialized in the release of hentai anime titles on VHS and DVD. The first product released was Legend of Lyon Flare. This division was shut down in 2005 after spinning off from ADV, and most of its titles were acquired by Critical Mass, the hentai division of The Right Stuf International. In 2017, the SoftCel label was relaunched by Section23 Films, one of ADV's successor companies. = Happy Carrot = ADV started the Happy Carrot branch in 2008 to release hentai anime titles on DVD, replacing SoftCel. This branch released a total of four titles between 2008 and 2009, two were reissues of VHS titles and two were new titles. Following the 2009 closure of ADV, the label has been defunct. ADV Kids  Magazines  = Newtype USA = Newtype USA was the US edition of Japan's Newtype magazine. The first issue was published in November, 2002. A.D. Vision (ADV) contacted its advertising partners to let them know that the February 2008 issue of Newtype USA was the last issue of the magazine. The magazine contained material it translated from the Japanese release as well as articles from American writers. It was expected to have 50,000 copies in for its initial circulation. = PiQ = PiQ premiered in May 2008 as a replacement for Newtype USA. It was published by PiQ LLC, a now-defunct subsidiary. The magazine had a broader focus and expanded coverage of topics beyond anime and manga. PiQ retained much of the editorial staff and freelance writers that once worked on its predecessor, as well as its 15,000 subscribers. In June 2008, after only four issues had been published, PiQ was canceled and its offices abruptly closed down. The July 2008 dated issue, which had already been released when the announcement was made, was the magazine's last issue. Foreign distribution ADV Films established international divisions in the United Kingdom and Germany to directly release their properties there. They also released titles that were not originally licensed by ADV Films in North America, such as Chobits, Gad Guard, Hellsing, Last Exile, Mahoromatic: Automatic Maiden (because of ADV's close relations with Gainax because of Neon Genesis Evangelion), and Rurouni Kenshin. Because of ADV's large number of titles, its UK division also became the largest anime distributor in the UK from the early 2000s until 2009. However, it faced competition against Manga Entertainment UK and MVM Films. Its German division was not as successful as the UK division since the majority of titles licensed by ADV US were already licensed by other anime distributors. Following the collapse of A.D. Vision, the fate of the titles released by A.D. Vision's international divisions remain unknown, although it is possible that local distributors would pick up the titles, such as Manga Entertainment & MVM Films in the United Kingdom, and Animaze Germany and Nipponart, Kaz√© Germany, etc. in Germany. However, Devil May Cry, Guyver: The Bioboosted Armor, and Ah! My Goddess (season 2) were re- licensed by Manga Entertainment (UK), Welcome to the N.H.K. was re-licensed by MVM Films (UK), and Chobits was re-licensed by Kaz√© Germany in Germany.  Business  A.D. Vision's success was noted across its divisions in a variety of ways. In 2004, A.D. Vision's film unit achieved $150 million in annual sales and the company had licenses for 1,000 manga books and published the magazine Newtype USA.

Similar to the pickaxe, it has a long handle and a stout head which combines either a vertical axe blade with a horizontal adze (cutter mattock) or a pick and an adze (pick mattock). A cutter mattock is similar to a Pulaski. It is also commonly known in North America as a \\"grub axe\\". Description A mattock has a shaft, typically made of wood, which is about long. The head consists of two ends, opposite each other and separated by a central eye. A mattock head typically weighs . The form of the head determines the kind and uses of the mattock: * A cutter mattock combines the functions of an axe and adze, with its axe blade oriented vertically and longer adze horizontally. * A pick mattock combines the function of a pick and adze, with a pointed end opposite an adze blade. Both are used for grubbing in hard soils and rocky terrain, with the pick mattock having the advantage of a superior penetrating tool over the cutter mattock, which excels at cutting roots. Uses Using the adze to excavate Mattocks are \\"the most versatile of hand-planting tools\\". They can be used to chop into the ground with the adze and pull the soil towards the user, opening a slit to plant into. They can also be used to dig holes for planting into, and are particularly useful where there is a thick layer of matted sod. The use of a mattock can be tiring because of the effort needed to drive the blade into the ground, and the amount of bending and stooping involved. The adze of a mattock is useful for digging or hoeing, especially in hard soil. Cutter mattocks () are used in rural Africa for removing stumps from fields, including unwanted banana suckers. History As a simple but effective tool, mattocks have a long history. Their shape was already established by the Bronze Age in Asia Minor and ancient Greece. According to Sumerian mythology, the mattock was invented by the god Enlil. Mattocks () are the most commonly depicted tool in Byzantine manuscripts of Hesiod's Works and Days. Mattocks made from antlers first appear in the British Isles in the Late Mesolithic. They were probably used chiefly for digging, and may have been related to the rise of agriculture. Mattocks made of whalebone were used for tasks including flensing ‚Äì stripping blubber from the carcass of a whale ‚Äì by the broch people of Scotland and by the Inuit. Etymology The word mattock is of unclear origin; one theory traces it from Proto-Germanic, from Proto-Indo-European (see Wiktionary). There are no clear cognates in other Germanic languages, and similar words in various Celtic languages are borrowings from the English (e.g. , , ). However, there are proposed cognates in Old High German and Middle High German, and more speculatively with words in Balto-Slavic languages, including Old Church Slavonic ' and Lithuanian ', and even Sanskrit. It may be cognate to or derived from the unattested Vulgar Latin ', meaning club or cudgel. The New English Dictionary of 1906 interpreted mattock as a diminutive, but there is no root to derive it from, and no semantic reason for the diminutive formation. Forms such as mathooke, motthook and mathook were produced by folk etymology. Although used to prepare whale blubber, which the Inuit call \\"mattaq\\", no such connection is known. While the noun \\"mattock\\" is attested from Old English onwards, the transitive verb \\"to mattock\\" or \\"to mattock up\\" first appeared in the mid-17th century.

His films are held in archives including the New Zealand Film Archive, British Film Institute, Museum of Modern Art in New York City, and the Pacific Film Archive at University of California, Berkeley. Lye's sculptures are found in the collections of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery and the Berkeley Art Museum. Although he became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1950, much of his work went to New Zealand after his death, where it is housed at the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery in New Plymouth. Career As a student, Lye became convinced that motion could be part of the language of art, leading him to early (and now lost) experiments with kinetic sculpture, as well as a desire to make film. Lye was also one of the first white / PƒÅkehƒÅ artists to appreciate the art of MƒÅori, Australian Aboriginal, Pacific Island and African cultures, and this had great influence on his work. In the early 1920s Lye travelled widely in the South Pacific. He spent extended periods in Australia and Samoa, where he was expelled by the New Zealand colonial administration for living within an indigenous community. Working his way as a coal trimmer aboard a steam ship, Lye moved to London in 1926. He quickly entered modernist circles, exhibiting with the Seven and Five Society from 1927 until 1934 and becoming affiliated with the Footprints Studio. Most notably, Lye exhibited in the 1936 International Surrealist Exhibition and began to make experimental films. Following his first animated film Tusalava, Lye began to make films in association with the British General Post Office, for the GPO Film Unit. He reinvented the technique of drawing directly on film, producing his animation for the 1935 film A Colour Box, an advertisement for \\"cheaper parcel post\\", without using a camera for anything except the title cards at the beginning of the film. It was the first direct film screened to a general audience. It was made by painting vibrant abstract patterns on the film itself, synchronizing them to a popular dance tune by Don Baretto and His Cuban Orchestra. A panel of animation experts convened in 2005 by the Annecy film festival put this film among the top ten most significant works in the history of animation (his later film Free Radicals was also in the top 50). Lye also worked for the GPO Film Unit's successor, the Crown Film Unit producing wartime information films, such as Musical Poster Number One. On the basis of this work, Lye was later offered work for The March of Time newsreel in New York. Leaving his wife and children in England, Lye moved to New York in 1944. In Free Radicals he used black film stock and scratched designs into the emulsion. The result was a dancing pattern of flashing lines and marks, as dramatic as lightning in the night sky. In 2008, this film was added to the United States National Film Registry.\\"Cinematic Classics, Legendary Stars, Comedic Legends and Novice Filmmakers Showcase the 2008 Film Registry\\" News from the Library of Congress (30 December 2008) Lye continued to experiment with the possibilities of direct film-making to the end of his life. In various films he used a range of dyes, stencils, air-brushes, felt tip pens, stamps, combs and surgical instruments, to create images and textures on celluloid. In Color Cry, he employed the \\"photogram\\" method combined with various stencils and fabrics to create abstract patterns. It is a 16mm direct film featuring a searing soundtrack by the blues singer Sonny Terry. As a writer, Len Lye produced a body of work exploring his theory of IHN (Individual Happiness Now). He also wrote a large number of letters and poems. He was a friend of Dylan Thomas, and of Laura Riding and Robert Graves (their Seizin Press published No Trouble, a book drawn from Lye's letters to them, his mother, and others, in 1930). The NZEPC (New Zealand Electronic Poetry Centre) website contains a selection of Lye's writings, which are just as surprising and experimental as his work in other media. One of his theories was that artists attempt to reproduce themselves in their works, which he exposited in an essay complete with visual examples. A 45m Wind Wand on the New Plymouth waterfrontLye was also an important kinetic sculptor and what he referred to as \\"Tangibles\\". He saw film and kinetic sculpture as aspects of the same \\"art of motion\\", which he theorised in a highly original way in his essays (collected in the book Figures of Motion). Many of his kinetic works can be found at the Govett- Brewster Art Gallery in New Plymouth, Taranaki including a 45-metre high Wind Wand near the sea. The Water Whirler, designed by Lye but never realised in his lifetime, was installed on Wellington's waterfront in 2006. His \\"Tangibles\\" were shown at MOMA in New York in 1961 and are now found worldwide. In 1977, Len Lye returned to his homeland to oversee the first New Zealand exhibition of his work at the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery. Shortly before his death in 1980, Lye and his supporters established the Len Lye Foundation, to which he gave his work. The gallery is the repository for much of this collection, employing a full-time curator to ensure its preservation and appropriate exhibition. Lye was a maverick, never fitting any of the usual art historical labels. Although he did not become a household name, his work was familiar to many film-makers and kinetic sculptors ‚Äì he was something of an \\"artist's artist\\", and his innovations have had an international influence. He is also remembered for his colourful personality, amazing clothes, and highly unorthodox lecturing style (he taught at New York University for three years). The 21st century has seen renewed international interest in Lye's career with retrospectives held at the Pompidou Centre, Paris in 2000, an Australian touring exhibition organised in 2001 by the Art Gallery of NSW, Sydney, at ACMI, Melbourne in 2009, and at Ikon Gallery, Birmingham UK in 2010. Similarly, in New Zealand, surveys have been shown at the Gus Fisher Gallery, Auckland in 2009, and City Gallery Wellington in 2013. The University of Auckland staged an opera about his life in 2012. Personal life Lye was married twice. His first wife was Jane (Florence Winifred) Thompson with whom he had two children: * Bix Lye, also a sculptor, who lives and works in Williamsburg, New York * Yancy Ning Lou Lye (born 20 May 1940, Chiswick, London) In Reno, Nevada, in May 1948, Lye married his second wife, Annette \\"Ann\\" Zeiss (born 1910, Minnesota) on the same day he obtained a divorce from Jane. Ann was formerly married to Tommy Hindle, a British journalist. He died in Warwick, New York, in 1980. Len Lye Collection The Len Lye Collection and Archive consists of all non-film works in Lye‚Äôs possession at the time of his death in 1980, as well as several items that have been given to or otherwise acquired by the Foundation since. This body of work is extended by Len Lye works in the Govett-Brewster Art Gallery. The New Zealand Film Archive is the repository of Lye‚Äôs film prints that are owned by the Len Lye Foundation, and viewing prints are also in the Collection at the Govett- Brewster. The Len Lye Centre a dedicated gallery for the Len Lye collection connected to the Govett-Brewster was opened on 25 July 2015. This is the first gallery in New Zealand to be dedicated to a single artist. Documentaries There are two documentaries about Lye: Flip and Two Twisters, directed by Shirley Horrocks and Doodlin', and a DVD of Lye's talks illustrated with slides: Len Lye Talks about Art.

Typically, it is a reference to any such media that predates the mainstream popularity of the DVD format. History Georges Demeny on 3 March 1892 patented a 'phonoscope', designed in 1891, that can project chronophotographic pictures on a glass disc. Eadweard Muybridge used his zoopraxiscope to project chronophotographic pictures on a glass disc in 1893. E & H T Anthony, a camera maker based in New York, marketed in 1898 a combination motion picture camera and projector called \\"The Spiral\\" that could capture 200 images arranged in a spiral on an 8-inch diameter glass plate. When played back at 16 frames per second, it would give a running time of 13 seconds. Theodore Brown patented in 1907 (UK patent GB190714493) a photographic disk system of recording approximately 1,200 images in a spiral of pictures on a 10-inch disk. Played back at 16 frames per second, a disk provides around one and a quarter minutes of material. The system was marketed as the Urban Spirograph by Charles Urban, and discs were produced - but it soon disappeared. John Logie Baird, created the Phonovision system in the early 1930s, which mechanically produces about four frames per second. The system was not successful. P.M.G. Toulon, a French inventor working at Westinghouse Electric during the 1950s and 1960s patented a system in 1952 (US Patent 3198880) which uses a slow spinning disc with a spiral track of photographically 1.5 millimeter wide recorded frames, along with a flying spot scanner, which sweeps over them to produce a video image. This was intended to be synchronously combined with playback from a vinyl record. It appears a working system was never produced. It has similarities with the tape based Electronic Video Recording system, which was released for professional use. Westinghouse Electric Corporation developed a system in 1965 called Phonovid, that allows for the playback of 400 stored still images, along with 40 minutes of sound. The system uses a standard record player, and builds the picture up slowly. The Television Electronic Disc, a mechanical system, was rolled out in Germany and Austria in 1970 by Telefunken. The 12-inch discs have a capacity of about eight minutes; however, it was abandoned in favor of VHS by its parent company. In Japan, the TOSBAC computer was using digital video disks to display color pictures at 256x256 image resolution in 1972.First USA-Japan Computer Conference Proceedings: October 3-5, 1972, Tokyo, Japan, page 320, American Federation of Information Processing Societies In 1973, Hitachi announced a video disc capable of recording 15-colour still images on a disc. The same year, Sony announced a video disc recorder, similar to the Sony Mavica format. In 1975, Hitachi introduced a video disc system in which chrominance, luminance and sound information are encoded holographically. Each frame is recorded as a 1mm diameter hologram on a 305mm disc, while a laser beam reads out the hologram from three angles. It has a capacity of 54,000 frames, with a running time of 30 minutes for the NTSC color standard or 36 minutes for PAL/SECAM. Visc is a mechanical video disc system developed in Japan by Matsushita subsidiary National Panasonic in 1978. The 12-inch vinyl disc is spun at 500 rpm with each revolution holding three frames of color video, with a total of up to an hour of video on each side of the disc. Discs can be recorded in either a 30-minute-per-side format, or a 60-minute-per-side-format. A later incarnation of the system uses 9-inch discs in caddies capable of storing 75 minutes per side.Billboard, 28 April 1979 The system was abandoned in January 1980 in favor of JVC's VHD system.Video Age: Television Technology and Applications in the 1980s (Video Bookshelf) (Hardcover) The DiscoVision system was released in America in 1978. Developed by MCA and Philips of the Netherlands, it utilizes an optical reflective system read by a laser beam. It was renamed several times, as VLP, Laservision, and CD Video. Finally, Japan's Pioneer Electronic Corporation trademarked it as LaserDisc, the name by which it is perhaps best known. The format struggled to gain wide acceptance in the consumer market, and Pioneer became the chief sponsor of the format when MCA, and later Philips, withdrew their support for it. The high cost of both players and discs was the main reason for its ultimate demise. Thomson CSF created a system that uses thin flexible video discs and a transmissive laser system, with light source and pickup on opposite sides of the disc. The system was marketed for industrial and educational use in 1980. Each side of the disc can hold 50,000 still CAV frames, and both sides can be read without removing the disc. Thomson exited the videodisc market in 1981. RCA produced a system called CED under the brand SelectaVision in 1981. The system uses a physical pickup riding in grooves of a pressed disc, reading variance in capacitance in the underlying disc. The system competed with Laserdisc for a few years, before being abandoned. JVC produced a system very similar to CED called Video High Density (VHD). It was launched in 1983 and marketed predominantly in Japan. It is a capacitance contact system but without grooves. VHD discs were adopted in the UK by Thorn EMI which started to develop a consumer catalogue, including bespoke material. Development for the mass market was halted in late 1983, but the system remained on sale for educational and business markets as a computer-controlled video system until the late 1980s. Laserfilm, a videodisc format developed by McDonnell Douglas was released in (1984?). MovieCD, by SIRIUS Publishing, Inc. (1995?), is a format that uses a traditional CD-ROM disc for playback on a Windows PC containing a video file of a movie encoded in a proprietary codec developed by the publisher (the MotionPixels codec, also used in some PC video games in the mid-to-late 1990s), with the disc also containing codec and playback software for the movie. The quality is somewhat low due to the compression the MotionPixels codec used, resulting in a playback resolution of only 320x236 at 16 frames per second, using 16-bit high color. DVD (Digital Video Disc, or Digital Versatile Disc) was released in 1996. It is a hybrid of Philips and Sony's MM- CD (Multi-Media Compact Disc) format and Toshiba's SD (Super Density) format. The last-minute adoption of the hybrid DVD format was agreed to by all three companies in an effort to avoid a damaging format war, similar to that between Beta and VHS in the 1970s and 1980s. Toshiba failed to reach a similar compromise agreement with Sony in the race to develop a high-definition optical video disc format in the 2000s. This proved to be a costly mistake for Toshiba (and the format's co-developers, NEC and Microsoft), and the AOD (Advanced Optical Disc) format, later renamed HD DVD, lost a brutal format war with Sony's Blu-ray Disc (BD) format. This format war delayed acceptance of either format, and Blu-ray Disc has only recently gained traction in the consumer market, where it competes with the continued success of DVD and the rise of streaming movie services such as Netflix.

Although mostly vaguely defined, the region's extent roughly covers the planning areas of Jurong East, Jurong West, Boon Lay, and Pioneer, along with Jurong Island in the Western Islands cluster and the southernmost portions of the Western Water Catchment. Should it be described at its greatest historical extent, the region can also include present-day Bukit Batok and Tuas as well. Jurong also covers several offshore islands as well, including Pulau Damar Laut and Pulau Samulun, both of which are located within the planning areas of Jurong East and Boon Lay respectively; along with the aforementioned Jurong Island. The coastline of the region on mainland Singapore, faces the strait of Selat Jurong, while the southernmost island of the region, Jurong Island, faces the strait of Selat Pandan. Jurong was largely industrialised in the early 1960s in a response to the general economic situation of post-war Singapore. The heavy redevelopment of the region paved the way for the opening of a large-scale industrial sector in the country, something which was unprecedented at that time. Today, the rapid growth and much development of Jurong has led it to become one of the most densely-populated industrial areas in the city-state. Etymology \\"Jurong\\" took its name from Sungei Jurong, a river that still channels into Jurong Lake, the latter of which was created by damming the river itself. Although its origins are disputed, the core definition of \\"Jurong\\", is probably derived from several meanings in Malay. The term could probably refer to the word for shark, \\"Jerung\\". It can also be derived from the word \\"Jurang\\" or a gorge. Jurong could also take its name from the word, \\"Penjuru\\", which roughly translates to, corner. Penjuru may most likely refer to the peninsula that sits between Sungei Jurong and Sungei Pandan. The native Malays named this peninsula, Tanjong Penjuru, which can be translated as Cape Corner in English. The present-day site of Tanjong Penjuru is now the subzone of Penjuru Crescent. Geography =Pre-industrial Jurong= Landscape Philip Jackson's Plan of the British Settlement of Singapore. The region that is now Jurong can be seen on the south-western end of the map of mainland Singapore (top). Although Jurong's geography was documented on a few maps and records following Singapore's founding in 1819, the area only became clearer to the British in an 1828 geographical survey of the island by Lieutenant Philip Jackson. In a map that was drawn after the survey, the lieutenant clearly describes most of Jurong's natural geography with the two rivers of Jurong, Sungei Jurong and Sungei Pandan, marked on the map. He also noted down several islands which have since ceased to exist. Such islands include, Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau Butun, Pulau Pese (Pulau Pesek), Pulau Sakra and Pulau Saraya (Pulau Seraya), all of which have since merged to form Jurong Island. Current geographical landmarks such as Pulau Damar Laut and the strait of Selat Sembilan (now Selat Jurong) have also been included on the map. The two rivers of Jurong were mentioned again in 1848, when a second survey conducted by John Turnbull Thomson, described the original shape and settlements of Sungei Jurong and Sungei Pandan. Turnbull describes both rivers as, \\"large creeks\\" with settlements around the both. However, in the case of Sungei Jurong, Thomson gives his description as such: Before the damming of Sungei Jurong, the present-day site of Jurong Lake was once occupied by two streams that split at the junction of the river. These two streams have since ceased to exist. However, like what Thomson said, these bodies of water roughly marked the present day locations of Jurong East and West, at that time identified as Jurong and Peng Kang on colonial era maps respectively. Before its development in the 1960s, Jurong was left close to its pristine state after Singapore's founding in 1819. Although there were a few settlements around Jurong, most of the land was mainly uncharted territory. Swamps dominated the coastline of Jurong, yielding large amounts of wildlife such as mudskippers and horseshoe crabs. A forest reserve of dipterocarp trees would have once stood inland behind the grove of rhizophora trees along the coast. Low hills were mainly the highest elevated points around Jurong, although most of them were later levelled over the years. This was evident, given the description made by Commodore Perry in his accounts of Jurong made during the Perry Expedition: Territorial extent In maps made by the British administration before Singapore's self-governance in 1959, the colonial era district (mukim) of Jurong was rather small, occupying what is today the present-day town of Bukit Batok and Tengah. Jurong Mukim was earlier known as West Bukit Timak Mukim, the renaming to Juong Mukim is probably with reference the Jurong settlement located at the head of Jurong River and also located at the south-west corner of this Mukim. Other than that, most part of Jurong Mukim has very little historical basis for calling herself 'Jurong'. Furthermore, many residents have often regarded the areas along the stretch of Jurong Road, especially the southern areas, as part of the extant of Jurong. Such areas include the colonial era districts (mukims) of Peng Kang (now Jurong West and Boon Lay), the southern portions of Choa Chu Kang (now Jurong West extension and NTU), Pandan (now split into Jurong East to the west and Clementi to the east) and Tuas (now Pioneer and the newly-reclaimed Tuas peninsula). =Modern Jurong= Ecology Clementi, the western branch of Sungei Pandan Today, most of what is left of the original pristine Jurong is restricted to the areas around the Pandan Reservoir and Sungei Pandan. Little traces of the dipterocarp forest still remain. The mangrove swamps today are now just a fraction of its former self, located at the mouth of Sungei Pandan. The untouched mangrove fringes still hold the last remnants of wildlife in Jurong. It is because of this that area remains a hotspot for nature enthusiasts and bird watchers to this day. Water bodies Jurong is home to two prominent rivers, Sungei Jurong and Sungei Pandan, both of which flow into two larger water bodies, Jurong Lake and Pandan Reservoir respectively. The two rivers also source from Selat Jurong, a strait that faces south of mainland Singapore and north of Jurong Island. Pandan Reservoir at sunset The two rivers also have extensions that flow into the mainland portion of the region. Sungei Pandan has a western branch, Sungei Ulu Pandan, which flows from Jurong East into the town of Clementi before cutting off at Queenstown located east of Clementi. Sungei Jurong channels out of Jurong Lake via a stream located west of the lake and Jurong Canal located directly north of the lake. The canal also serves as the boundary line between the towns of Jurong East and West. Elevation points The highest elevation point in the region is Jurong Hill, which is located close to the centre of the industrial estate at Jurong (positioned north of Jurong Island) just adjacent to Jurong Bird Park. Geology Jurong's unique locale lends to itself a special rock formation unlike any other in Singapore. Named the Jurong Formation, the sedimentary rock deposits can trace its roots back to the late Triassic and early to middle Jurassic periods. Territorial extent The name \\"Jurong\\" is often used to collectively describe the region's five main planning areas. However, the URA does not officially recognise all of these places as a single territorial entity. Since the gazetting of the 1998 Master Plan, the Authority has officially classified Jurong as five individual separate planning areas. When Jurong is split into these five contiguous parts, it forms Jurong East and West in the north and north-west, Boon Lay and Pioneer to the south and south- west and Tuas to the extreme west of the region. Each of these individual areas can yet be further divided into subzones, smaller subdistricts that are a part of the larger planning area itself. If all five planning areas are combined, there would be a grand total of 34 subzones in Jurong. The boundaries of modern-day Jurong were first demarcated in the 1960 proposal of the new town. The planned town was to be located entirely south of Jurong Road, combining land that was once the colonial era districts (mukims) of Peng Kang, Pandan and the southernmost portion of Choa Chu Kang. As a result of this proposal, the government gazetted portions of land from these areas to increase the overall size of Jurong. These boundaries were later further defined with the introduction of the URA 1991 Concept Plan in September 1991. History =Before Raffles (c. 1600 ‚Äì 1819)= The earliest known significance of Jurong can be traced back to 1595 on a maritime documentation of oriental trading routes. Titled \\"Reys-gheschrift van de Navigation der Portugaloysers in Orienten\\", the journal written by Dutch author Jan Huyghen van Linschoten, names a certain \\"Selat Sembilan\\" that one must cross eastwards after reaching the southernmost end of the Strait of Malacca. This suggests that the straits near Jurong witnessed a significant role in the ancient maritime Silk Road. Although not mapped by Linschoten, the location of Selat Sembilan was later identified in Philip Jackson's 1828 survey of Singapore. Despite much land-reclamation works along most coastal parts of Jurong and Tuas, Selat Sembilan still exists today as Selat Jurong, stretching along the entire coastline of the region. Even before the arrival of Sir Stamford Raffles in 1819, small settlements had already been built along Jurong's coastal areas as well as the present-day site of Jurong Island, Pulau Damar Laut and Pulau Sembulan. Such squatters were inhabited by the native Orang laut, and there also immigrants from the nearby Dutch East Indies and Malaya. =Colonial era (1819 to 1942)= Earliest developments Post- colonization, Jurong had a small population of inhabitants scattered along the banks of the area's two main rivers, Sungei Jurong and Sungei Pandan. It consisted mainly of a large Chinese and Malay migrant population. The majority of the Chinese population was Hokkien-speaking, immigrating from Anxi County in the province of Fujian, China. A Teochew demographic was also prevalent in Jurong. Originating from the City of Jieyang, the Teochew-speaking population mainly settled along the westernmost portions of Jurong. Most of the Malays and Orang Laut in the area were natives of the land, settling in squatters and villages located along the coast of Jurong long before the founding of Singapore as a British colony in 1819. There were also other ethnic Malay groups that came down from the rest of the Malay Archipelago who migrated from various parts of present-day Malaysia and Indonesia. However, the exact statistics concerning foreign Malays settling in Jurong after 1819 is not clear. In a visit to the area in 1848, the then-Chief Surveyor of Singapore, John Turnbull Thomson, made one of the earliest accounts regarding human settlements in Jurong. He described the demographics along Sungei Jurong as such: Thomson also gave his description on the population along Sungei Pandan: With the increase in population size over the years, the need for a mode of travel to and from the Town of Singapore, was necessary. Between 1852 and 1853, the first few portions of Jurong Road were paved to connect villages around Jurong to the metropolitan areas of Singapore Town and the rest of the island. This first portion of Jurong Road started from the seventh milestone of Bukit Timah Road ending along the head of Sungei Jurong. Although it isn't known when the rest of the road was paved, by 1936, the road stretched up to the district of Tuas. =An American expedition= The lithograph of Sungei Jurong made during the Perry Expedition of 1853 to 1854 In 1853, US Navy Commodore Matthew C. Perry led a maritime expedition to Japan in an attempt to open up the country (then under self-imposed isolation) to the world for trade and the possible building of political and economic ties. The fleet of the Perry Expedition stopped over at a few countries before reaching the Japanese archipelago. Amongst one of the few docking locations during the trip was Singapore. This made it the second time that the United States had made a diplomatic presence on the island since the Exploring Expedition. Perry's crew anchored their fleet of two frigates and two sloops-of-war along Selat Sembilan and Sungei Jurong, where they surveyed the surroundings of the strait and the river. Wilhelm Heine and Eliphalet Brown, two of the official expedition's artists, were tasked at producing a lithograph depicting the villages along Sungei Jurong. The resulting image was one of the earliest illustrations of colonial-era Jurong. The interesting point of the image is the scene of a forest fire shown in the background. This was common at the time as such raging wildfires were often rampant and common throughout most of Jurong in the mid-19th century. Another point worthy of note in the image is the United States flag seen affixed on the stern of the sampan in the foreground. Earliest industries =Agriculture and aquaculture= Before the early 1960s, small and large plantations alike dominated the area, which produced and harvested crops such as pineapple, pepper, gambier and nutmeg, thus providing key sources of income for the people of the district. However, in the early period of time, the main produce for export by the plantations of Jurong was gambier. Gambier's practical uses and medicinal properties made the plant-crop significantly valuable and gambier plantations proved to become profitable for the Chinese kangchu-owners situated in the area, the local communities and other local and foreign plantation owners. In 1855, the Municipal Committee of the British colonial government reported that there were 20 of such legally-recognised gambier plantations existing within Jurong. However, this figure is not entirely accurate given the fact that many illegal ones were also set up in the area. Rubber was also a popular agricultural industry in Jurong at that time and was regarded as a strong competitor to the gambier plantation businesses and firms that were flourishing and expanding in the district. By the first half of the 20th century, the practices of rubber-tapping and the setting up of rubber plantations overtook the role of planting and harvesting gambier, an agricultural activity that once thrived in Jurong. A notable example of a business dealing in gambier that shifted to the rubber-plantation sector was the plantation firm that belonged to Chinese business-magnate Chew Boon Lay. The large amount of land that his plantation stood on was often well- associated with his name. Today, this area is known as Boon Lay Place and is a small subzone that is enclaved within the new town of Jurong West. Aside from the profitable reliance on cash-crops and large plantations, fishing was also another prominent form of income for the locals staying in Jurong, although this job aspect was mostly handled and dealt with by the local Malay and Orang Laut population, most of whom chose to live along the coastlines of Jurong or had already settled there for many generations. Fishing was also conducted along the two of the more prominent rivers of Jurong at Sungei Jurong and Sungei Pandan respectively. Numerous prawn farms were also set up along these two rivers where such crustacean species naturally thrived. By the 1950s, 500 acres of land in Jurong was specifically designated for prawn-farming in Jurong. This was roughly half of the total amount of land used for prawn farms located all over Singapore at that time. =Manufacturing and processing= For some time before the period of rapid industrialisation occurring in Jurong throughout the 1960s, Jurong was already a host to several businesses in the heavy industry (primarily dealing with construction and manufacturing), most notably, the brickwork industrial sector. Local businesses involving in brick manufacturing and earthenware production were largely set up around Yunnan in Jurong West, where the soil conditions there could yield much clay and terracotta. Although almost all of these factories and industries closed down over the years (most were shut down by the late 1990s and early 2000s), the brickwork industry remains strong (primarily in the form of its past and its legacy) in Jurong even to this day. The earliest brick factories in Jurong emerged in the 1920s and exported large quantities of the building material to construction sites around Singapore as well as to Malaya (now Malaysia), with a notable brick factory in the area being the Jurong Brickworks. First set up in the 1930s, Jurong Brickworks was one of the largest privately owned brick manufacturers and suppliers in Singapore. During the company's heyday and booming peak all throughout the 1970s, it manufactured more than three million bricks every month. Jurong Brickworks was eventually shut down in 2005 and the entire manufacturing plant was demolished in that same year as well. Another notable earthenware-production business located in Jurong is the Thow Kwang Dragon Kiln. Set up by Chinese immigrants in the 1940s, this pottery manufacturer, along with its neighbouring counterpart, the Jalan Bahar Clay Studios, continues to exist to this day and remain as the only possessor of a pair of dragon kilns in Singapore. Although located in an area that is traditionally a part of Jurong, the kilns are technically located next to Nanyang Technological University, which is situated in the Western Water Catchment. =Similar business ventures= Aside from his plantation, Chew Boon Lay also owned one of the earliest factories (a manufacturing plant) that was located in Jurong. During its time in business-operation from 1950 to 1958, the manufacturing plant produced a wide range of canned goods (foodstuff) that ranged from kaya to curry and even peanut butter. It was located along Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim and was opposite from the location of where Jurong Bird Park is located at now. This same building was also a temporary location for the management offices of the Jurong Town Corporation in 1968. =Second World War (1941‚Äì45)= 101 Special Training School Jurong Port with Pulau Damar Laur in the background. The location of Tanjong Balai would have been relative to the southern portion of the present-day port. Following the invasion of Thailand in the beginning of December in 1941, the Imperial Japanese Army was rapidly heading southwards down the Malay Peninsula towards Singapore. It was rather obvious, by then, to many that a Japanese military assault on the island was nearly imminent. In light of the oncoming threat, the Oriental Mission of the UK's Special Operations Executive chose to set up a training institution/school in Singapore to assist and train members of possible anti-Japanese resistance movements throughout Japanese-occupied British Malaya and, later, Singapore. One proposed site for the training base was at Pulau Ubin. However, the suggestion was dropped for a number of reasons. Issues such as the difficulty of clearing thick jungle foliage, the cost of building and developing the training base's site, the lack of access to freshwater and the risk of contagious malaria and other diseases made Pulau Ubin unsuitable for a possible location. Later on, during the formation of Singapore Armed Forces, the proposed site for the training bases are located at Pasir Laba and Pulau Tekong respectively. Pasir Laba was the first to be built during the formation of SAF, and set up the live firing zone in the west. Pulau Tekong was the second to be built. A 1942 map of Singapore from the book, Australia in the War of 1939‚Äì1945, highlighting the Jurong-Kranji defence line in red along the stretch between Sungei Jurong and the Kranji River The SOE eventually settled on a small and isolated island known as Tanjong Balai. Located at the mouth of Sungei Jurong, the island was where a single man-made structure, consisting of a lone bungalow that was once owned by Jewish businessman Joseph Brook David, was located. Apart from the bungalow, the island was also well-hidden amongst the canopy of secondary-type rainforest and what was even better was the convenience of accessing the location either by a boat or by a well-hidden path in the jungle. With the SOE's settling down at Tanjong Balai, the Number 101 Special Training School was created and mainly trained its personnel in the various fields of sabotage, reconnaissance and espionage to prepare them for resistance efforts against Japanese occupation forces. With the invading Japanese military pushing into Singapore by February in 1942, the training base was quickly closed down with the destruction of related documents and the abandonment of the training base Tanjong Balai. A new SOE training base was later established in Burma in the former capital city of Myanmar at Rangoon. Today, the island of Tanjong Balai and the training base located there is largely unheard-of by many modern-day Singaporeans. The island has since been subsumed by Jurong Port after further land-reclamation works were carried out in the 1980s to expand the harbour. =Modern history (1960‚Äìpresent)= The need to industrialise Post-war Singapore was plagued with much economic and financial trouble. A largely-uneducated population and the then- chronic lack of jobs meant that the amount of available manpower in the country was quite scarce. By the end of the decade of the 1950s, the total unemployment rate in post-war Singapore stood at about 14%, which encompassed an estimated 200,000 people out of the whole population at that time. To add on to the problems of widespread unemployment and the subsequent general poverty of the people that followed, the government had to tackle the issue of the then-high birth-rate in the country, which increased every year by around 4%. With the Cold War already present and the then-constant threat of communism spreading from Malaya, the country's Legislative Assembly was being pressured to keep the British-ruled crown colony financially stable and economically strong. In 1959, the People's Action Party emerged victorious in the first general election held in a self-governing Singapore. A crucial element of the party's agenda shortly after coming to power was the promise of more and better employment opportunities and jobs for the people and the need to build up and strengthen the weak economy of a newly-developing self- governing nation. Thus, the new PAP-led government had a desperate and urgent need to resolve the issue of Singapore's weak economy and Dr Goh Keng Swee, then the finance minister of Singapore, was quickly put in charge of this challenging task. Dr Goh determined that the only way to improve and strengthen Singapore's weak economy was through industrialisation. He envisioned a major industrial town in Singapore that would have modern industries mainly based in the manufacturing sector, such as shipyards, steelworks, chemical plants and other factories. Although such an idea was not the first of its kind, Dr Goh's plans for an industrial estate in Jurong were much more ambitious and wider-reaching than other previously-made proposals. Jurong Industrial Estate Jurong Industrial Estate with Jurong West in the background On the 4th of July in 1960, the Legislative Assembly of Singapore announced a proposal to construct a new industrial town in Jurong. The entire project, which totalled $45.7 million in cost, begun almost immediately after the proposal's announcement, with the immediate processes of planning and designing taking place in August in that same year. For Jurong's industrialisation, with Singapore's request for assistance with regard to economic development, the United Nations Industrial Survey Mission designated Dutch economic/financial advisor Dr Albert Winsemius to take charge of the project for the economic development of Singapore. The same UN mission also deployed Frenchman Mr P. Schereschewsky to survey Jurong's suitability for an industrial town. In 1961, the Economic and Development Board (the EDB) was formed to spearhead Singapore's industrialisation and earthworks for the construction and development of Jurong's industrial estate began in that same year. A year later, in 1962, the then-finance minister of Singapore, Dr Goh Keng Swee, helped to lay and set the foundation stone for the newly established National Iron and Steel Mills, the first factory in the new industrial estate (the factory has since been renamed to become NatSteel and the company is now a subsidiary of Tata Steel of India). At that time, many Singaporeans doubted the chances of success concerning Dr Goh's ambitious plan to develop the area for industrialisation and gave it the unflattering nickname of \\"Goh's Folly\\". They were quickly proven wrong, however, as 24 factories (of various types) were soon established in 1963. In May 1965, Jurong Port became operational. In 1968, the Jurong Town Corporation was created to direct and manage of Jurong's development. By this time, a total of 14.78 square-kilometres of industrial land had been prepared with 153 factories fully functioning and being up-and-running and 46 more being constructed and set up. With Singapore's economy constantly growing and developing ever more rapidly, finding more space for newer businesses and industries in the future is an ever-present and constant challenge. Seven islets off the southern coast of Jurong were merged to create the 30 square- kilometre Jurong Island, which is where most of the oil, chemical and petrochemical factories, manufacturing industries and plants in Singapore are located at. The construction and development of Jurong Island began in the early part of the 1990s and is scheduled to be completed by 2010 (as of 2016, much of the development works have been completed, with some newer developments about to commence or are still ongoing). A number of heavy-type industrial companies and firms, such as DuPont and Teijin Polycarbonate, amongst others, began their business operations there in the later part of the 1990s. The Jurong Island Causeway provides the only land-based link to Jurong Island from mainland Singapore. All forms of access to the island is heavily restricted ever since the September 11 attacks in 2001. An entry/exit security pass is required for all employees working at Jurong Island and cameras and all other recording equipment are banned from being transported into the island. Townships of Jurong Boon Lay, located in Jurong West, is one of the oldest housing estates that still currently exist in the area The first few low-rise flats in Jurong Town emerged in the precinct of Taman Jurong between 1963 and 1964, developed by the Housing and Development Board. Around this time, other notable housing estates, such as Boon Lay, began breaking ground as well. Despite the new residential developments, Jurong lacked a growing population. Reasons were largely due to the location of Jurong and the lack of infrastructure around the region at the time. The development of Jurong East and West started in the 1979 when estates such as Taman Jurong, Boon Lay Place, Bukit Batok, Bukit Gombak, Hong Kah, Teban Gardens and Yuhua were built, mostly due to the resettlement of Hong Kah and surrounding villages. Boon Lay Place, Taman Jurong and Hong Kah formed Jurong West New Town. Yuhua, Teban Gardens, Bukit Batok and Bukit Gombak formed Jurong East New Town. Jurong Regional Centre In 1982, Jurong West New Town started expanding as Jurong West Extension, which saw the realignment of the PIE to make it go through the southern boundary of present-day NTU, while converting the former section into Jurong West Avenue 2 and renaming the original Upper Jurong Road into Jurong West Avenue 4. Pioneer Road was extended North wards from present-day Upper Jurong Road as Pioneer Road North to the new PIE exit, which signalled the start of the development of Jurong West Extension (Yunnan, Pioneer and Gek Poh). The N9 estate was the first to be built and the N6 estate was the last, in the early 2000s. The MRT Line was extended from Lakeside to Boon Lay in 1990 and again to Pioneer in 2009. Spyros disaster On 12 October 1978, a Greek oil tanker, Spyros, exploded at Jurong Shipyard, killing more than 70 people in the immediate vicinity. The result was one of the worst man-made disasters/calamities since the Second World War in Singapore and the worst industrial accident since the country gained full independence in 1965. Infrastructure =Transportation= Private Jurong is well connected to the rest of Singapore by road, with Kranji Expressway linking them to the northern part of Singapore, Pan Island Expressway linking them to the Eastern part of Singapore and the Ayer Rajah Expressway linking them to the south-eastern part of Singapore. Clementi Avenue 6 and Jurong Town Hall Road complement the 3 expressways, topping off the well-built road connection from Jurong to all parts of the island. Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Jurong Point Shopping Mall with Boon Lay MRT station in the foreground The region is well-connected to the MRT system with Jurong East and Chinese Garden serving Jurong East. Lakeside, Boon Lay and Pioneer serving Jurong West and Joo Koon , Gul Circle , Tuas West Road, Tuas Link serving Pioneer & Tuas industrial areas. In the future, the 20-kilometre Jurong Region MRT Line will help to further connect commuters to places in Jurong and the rest of Singapore. Bus Jurong is served by public bus services originating from 4 interchanges and 1 bus depot, namely the Jurong East , Boon Lay , Joo Koon & Tuas bus interchanges and Soon Lee Bus Depot. =Economy= Commercial The main entrance to Jurong Point Shopping Mall The more notable shopping malls in Jurong are Jurong Point Shopping Mall in Pioneer and IMM in Yuhua. The largest suburban mall in Singapore, Jurong Point Shopping Mall is well-accessible by bus services from all the residential precincts of Jurong except Yuhua and Teban Gardens. This mall targets young adults and families with stalls selling fashion, food and beverages, sports, entertainment and lifestyle products. It also serves the elderly population with body-wellness stores and healthcare centres located at level 4 and 5 of the mall. It is well linked to the Boon Lay MRT station and Boon Lay Bus Interchange. IMM ‚Äì a popular shopping mall The largest outlet mall in Singapore, IMM is located within walking distance and visible from Jurong East MRT station. The mall contains a Kopitiam food court on Level 3, many furniture stores and other retail stores. These include a Popular Bookstore, one of Singapore's largest distributors of print and stationery products, and a Daiso department store, which sells decorative items and lifestyle products at low prices. There is a Giant Hypermarket at level 1 of the mall. A free shuttle bus service that ferries visitors to the mall from JCube & Westgate malls (near to Jurong East MRT Station) has stopped operations since 1 January 2017. It has been replaced by J-walk, a pedestrian network that connects shopping malls and hospitals to the Jurong East MRT Station. There are other shopping malls in Jurong, but are only well known within the precinct they are located in. Such malls include Hong Kah Point in Hong Kah and Taman Jurong Shopping Centre in Taman Jurong. =Tourism= Singapore Science Centre *Singapore Science Centre *Snow City *Singapore Discovery Centre *Singapore Army Museum *Jurong Bird Park (to be ceased and relocated to Mandai by 2020) Education Jurong Junior College is located within the region, in between Hong Kah and Boon Lay, although it was closed in 2019. There is at least 1 primary school and 1 secondary school in each precinct of Jurong including the Shuqun Primary School established in 1925 in Jurong West. Additionally, River Valley High School is located within Boon Lay, in close proximity to Jurong Point. Politics Jurong used to be an independent political constituency in the 1959 general elections. Chia Thye Poh represented the constituency in parliament between 1963 and 1966. Then, Boon Lay Constituency was carved out in 1976 and Hong Kah Constituency in 1984, forming four separate constituencies. Hong Kah Constituency eventually became a GRC that consisted of Nanyang, Hong Kah, Gek Poh and Bukit Batok in 1988. Teban Gardens, Pioneer, Yuhua and Taman Jurong were under Bukit Timah Constituency and the N9 region of Nanyang was under Jurong Constituency all that while. In 2001, there were major changes in the political constituencies of Jurong. Boon Lay Constituency, together with Teban Gardens and Pioneer, were absorbed into the expanded West Coast GRC. Hong Kah Constituency was re- designed to include towns of Chua Chu Kang (Limbang and Yew Tee) and Bukit Gombak and only Nanyang and Gek Poh remained in the constituency, this time including the N9 region of Nanyang. Jurong Constituency was abolished. Hong Kah and Bukit Batok were regrouped into the newly created Jurong GRC, along with Yuhua and Taman Jurong. As such, the entire political system of Jurong was changed with 3 GRCs as a result. 10 years later, in 2011, Gek Poh, Yuhua and Pioneer were crafted out from each of the three GRCs to become SMCs. In total, there are now six constituencies in Jurong. Nonetheless, though divided into six separate constituencies, all the precincts are collectively managed by the PAP and known as Jurong.

Following an apprenticeship as an apothecary, he opened his own commercial laboratory enterprise. His business manufactured and sold a variety of chemicals and laboratory equipment. Accum, himself, gave fee-based public lectures in practical chemistry and collaborated with research efforts at numerous other institutes of science. Intrigued by the work of Frederick Winsor, who had been championing the introduction of gas lighting in London, Accum too, became fascinated by this innovation. At the request of the Gas Light and Coke Company, he carried out many experiments in this novel field of inquiry. After a time of close working association with this company, he became a member of its board of directors in 1812. The company was charged with founding the first gasworks in London to supply gas lighting to both private and public areas. Accum was instrumental in the conception and design of this extremely successful gasworks. The majority of Accum's publications were written in English. They were executed in a style that made them quite accessible. Many scientific contributions were brought forth through his writings, which were influential in the popularization of chemistry during this era. In 1820, Accum published Treatise on Adulteration of Food, in which he denounced the use of chemical additives to food. This work marked the beginning of an awareness of need for food safety oversight. Accum was the first person to tackle the subject and to reach a wide audience through his activities. His book, controversial at the time, found a wide audience and sold well. However, it threatened established practices within the food processing industry, earning him many enemies among the London food manufacturers. Accum left England after a lawsuit was brought against him. He lived out the rest of his life as a teacher at an industrial institution in Berlin. Life and work =Youth and education= Friedrich Accum in his youth. Black and white reproduction of an oil painting by Accum's brother-in- law Wilhelm Strack. Accum was born in B√ºckeburg, Schaumburg-Lippe, about west of Hanover. His father was from Vlotho, and had been in an infantry regiment in the service of Count Wilhelm von Schaumburg-Lippe. In 1755, Accum's father converted from Judaism to Protestant Christianity. Soon after, his father married Judith Berth dit La Motte in B√ºckeburg. Judith was the daughter of a hat maker, who lived in the French community in Berlin, and the granddaughter of a refugee who suffered under the Huguenot persecutions in France.Cole, Friedrich Accum, p. 128 At the time of his conversion baptism, the senior Accum changed his name from Markus Herz to Christian Accum. In addition to choosing the name \\"Christian,\\" Accum's father chose to emphasize his newly embraced religion by adopting the surname Accum, which derives from the Hebrew word \\"Akum,\\" meaning \\"not-Jewish.\\" It is not known whether he did this on his own initiative or because of pressure from his fiancee's family. After his marriage, Christian Accum opened his own soap-making shop in B√ºckeburg at his in-law's home. Nine years after his marriage to Judith, he received legal citizenship from the city.B√ºrgerbuch der Stadt B√ºckeburg, Entry on 22 February 1764 cited in Browne, The life and chemical services of Frederick Accum, p. 831. On 9 May 1772, his father Christian died at the age of 45; three years after the birth of Freidrich'. Friedrich Accum attended the B√ºckeburg Gymnasium Adolfinum and additionally received private tutelage in the subjects of French and English. Following the conclusion of his studies, he finished an apprenticeship as an apothecary with the Brande family in Hanover, who were family friends.Cole, Friedrich Accum, p. 129, supposes that Judith Accum had good connections. The Brandes also conducted business in London and were the apothecaries to the Hanoverian King of England, George III.About the Brande family as apothecaries to the English court, see Leslie G. Matthews, London‚Äôs Immigrant Apothecaries, 1600‚Äì1800, in: Medical History 18, 3 (1974), available online as PDF, p. 262‚Äì274, here p. 269f. As one of the leading centers for scientific research and industry at the close of the eighteenth century, London attracted the best and brightest minds of Europe.Christa Jungnickel and Russell McCormmach Cavendish (American Philosophical Society: Philadelphia) 1996, p. 68 Accum felt the pull and relocated there in 1793. He found work as an assistant in another Brande apothecary located on Arlington Street. =The first year in London= After gaining experience as an assistant in the apothecary, Accum pursued scientific and medical studies at the School of Anatomy in Great Windmill Street in London. He became acquainted with the surgeon Anthony Carlisle (1768‚Äì1842) and the London chemist William Nicholson (1753‚Äì1815). In Mr. Nicholson's circulating journal, (Nicholson's Journal)Actual name is Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts. Accum published his first article in 1798. On 10 May 1798 Accum married Mary Ann Simpson (6 March 1777 ‚Äì 1 March 1816 in London). He had, meanwhile, anglicized his name to \\"Frederick Accum\\". Frederick and Mary had a total of eight children, but only two survived past childhood. In the fall of the year 1799, a translation of Franz Carl Achard's ground-breaking work on the production of sugar from beets appeared in Nicholson's Journal. Until that time, sugar cane, which was grown overseas, was the only plant from which sugar could be derived. This information made possible the creation of a domestic sugar industry, and was greeted with great interest. A short time after the article's publication, Accum had samples of beet sugar sent from Berlin, and presented them to William Nicholson. This was the first time sugar derived from beets had ever been present in England. Following his careful analysis of both types of sugar, Nicholson published a detailed report in the January edition of his journal, stating that there was no appreciable difference in taste between the two.Browne, The life and chemical services of Frederick Accum, p. 834. =Laboratory worker, merchant and private tutor= In 1800, Accum and his family changed residence in London from 17 Haymarket to 11 Old Compton Street. There he would live for the next twenty years. His family home also served as a school, an experimental laboratory and a mercantile for chemicals and scientific instruments. Accum's business cards of the time described his activities thus: > Mr Accum acquaints the Patrons and Amateurs of Chemistry that he continues > to give private Courses of Lectures on Operative and Philosophical > Chemistry, Practical Pharmacy and the Art of Analysis, as well as to take > Resident Pupils in his House, and that he keeps constantly on sale in as > pure a state as possible, all the Re-Agents and Articles of Research made > use of in Experimental Chemistry, together with a complete Collection of > Chemical Apparatus and Instruments calculated to Suit the conveniences of > Different Purchasers.Cole, Friedrich Accum, p. 129f. 1951. This cards was in > the Banks Collection in the Department of Prints and Drawings in British > Museum when Cole published his work. For his customers in London, Accum compiled and distributed a catalog of his merchandise for sale. This catalog was also sent to other locales upon request. For many years, Accum's establishment was the only significant institution in England that provided lectures on the theory of chemistry as well as training in laboratory practice. Amateurs were welcome to perform simple experiments on site to enhance their knowledge. Accum's teachings attracted various prominent students. These included the well-known London politician and later prime minister Lord Palmerston, the Duke of Bedford, and the Duke of Northumberland. Additionally, his laboratory was the first in Europe to be visited by students and scientists from the United States, among whom were Benjamin Silliman and William Dandridge Peck. When Silliman later became Professor of Chemistry at Yale College (precursor to Yale University) in New Haven, he ordered his first laboratory equipment from Accum in London. Accum's biographer, Charles Albert Browne, stated in his 1925 work that some of the older American colleges still had sales receipts from Accum's London business.Browne, The life and chemical services of Frederick Accum, p. 842. With the development of new laboratory apparatus, Accum positioned himself in the middle market range with respect to cost and usability. Accum developed portable laboratory kits, intended for farmers, for the analysis of soils and stones. With affordable prices ranging from three to eighty pounds sterling, these chests were the first truly portable laboratories.Browne, The life and chemical services of Frederick Accum, p. 845. =Teacher and researcher= In March 1801, Frederick Accum was offered a position at the Royal Institution in Ablemarle Street, a research institute founded two years earlier by Count Rumford.About the early history of the Royal Institution, see Morris Berman, The Early Years of the Royal Institution 1799‚Äì1810: A Re-Evaluation, in: Science Studies 2, 3 (1972), S. 205‚Äì240. Accepting the position, he began as laboratory assistant to Humphry Davy, who had been hired at the same time as director of the laboratory, and later became the president of the Royal Society. Accum‚Äôs employment at the Royal came to an end in September 1803. His biographer, R. J. Cole, speculates this change was connected with the simultaneous departure of Count Rumford for employment in Paris. Rumford had been the driving force behind securing a position for Accum. Chemical Lectures, contemporary caricature by Thomas Rowlandson. The inscription Surrey Institution on the door frame and the title Accum‚Äôs Lectures on the dust jacket held by the man sitting on the left under the corner both indicate that this image likely depicts Accum.It was M. D. George's opinion that Rowlandson caricatured Accum with the figure in the left corner. See Cole, Friedrich Accum, p. 131f. R. Burgess is of the contrary view: Humphry Davy or Friedrich Accum: a question of identification, in: Medical History 16,3 (1972), p. 290‚Äì293, available online PDF-Dokument from PubMed Central. By 1803, Accum had published a series of articles in Nicholson's Journal, which discussed a number of subjects: investigating methods to determine the purity of medicines, determining the existence of benzoic acids in vanilla extract, observing the explosivity of sulphur-phosphorus mixtures.Cole, Friedrich Accum, p. 131 lists On the Separation of Argillaceous Earth from Magnesia, in: Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts 2 (1798), p. 2; An Attempt to Discover the Genuineness and Purity of Drugs and Medicinal Preparations, in: Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts 2 (1798), p. 118; A Historical Note on the Antiquity of the Art of Etching on Glass, in: Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts 4 (1800), p. 1‚Äì4; The Occurrence of Benzoic Acid in Old Vanilla Pods, in: Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts 1 (1802), p. 295‚Äì302; Analysis of New Minerals such as the so called Salt of Bitumen, the Bit-Nobin of the Hindoos, in: Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts 5 (1803), p. 251‚Äì255; On Egyptian Heliotropium, in: Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts 6 (1803), p. 65‚Äì68; Experiments and Observations on the Compound of Sulphur and Phosphorus and the dangerous Explosions it makes when exposed to Heat, in: Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts 6 (1803), p. 1‚Äì7. In 1803 one of Accum's most significant publications was completed. Cole, Accum's biographer states that this book, System of Theoretical and Practical Chemistry, \\"was the first text-book of general chemistry written in the English language to be based on Lavoisier's new principles; it is outstanding, also, in that it is written in a popular style, the subject matter being graduated as with a modern text-book.\\"Cole, Friedrich Accum, p. 130. Accum held his first lecture on chemistry and mineralogy in a small room in his house on Old Compton Street. His audience grew so rapidly that he soon had to rent the Medical Theatre on Cork Street. After resigning from the Royal Institution and taking a new position with the Surrey Institution, he continued with his popular lectures. An advertisement in The Times on 6 January 1809 indicates that Accum offered a course on mineralogy and the chemical analysis of metals every Wednesday evening.Cole, Friedrich Accum, p. 132 citing the notice. It appeared in The Times on 6 January 1809, Nr. 7562. His increasing interest in mineralogy at this time is also apparent from the titles of two books he authored between 1803 and 1809. The first was a two volume work that appeared in 1804 entitled A Practical Essay on the Analysis of Minerals, which was reissued in 1808 as A Manual of Analytical Mineralogy. In 1809 he published Analysis of a Course of Lectures on Mineralogy. Beginning in 1808, while at the Surrey Institution, Accum also published, a series of articles on the chemical properties and composition of mineral water in Alexander Tilloch's Philosophical Journal.Cole, Friedrich Accum, p. 132 In 1811, when the Parisian saltpetre manufacturer Bernard Courtois made iodine for the first time from the kelp ash, his discovery was greeted with great interest by experts. Accum was among the first chemists in England to undertake experiments to isolate iodine. In two articles published in Tilloch's Philosophical Journal in January and February 1814, Accum described the iodine content of different kinds of seaweed and gave a detailed account of a process for iodine production.Browne, The life and chemical services of Frederick Accum, p. 851. =Accum's role in the history of gaslight= Artificial lighting of any sort was largely absent during the industrial development of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Using candles or oil lamps to illuminate a textile factory was costly, and economically unsound. With the advent of industrial means of production, not only were new textile halls physically larger, but they also had to be lit more brightly for longer periods of time. Driven by great demand, and made possible through Lavoisier's theoretical work regarding the role of oxygen in combustion, the end of the 18th century saw a continuous series of improvements in lighting technology.Schivelbusch, Lichtblicke, p. 16f. The production of gases from coal had been noted by Henry Clayton. He shared this observation with Robert Boyle in a letter written in the 17th century. The letter was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1739. Clayton wrote: > I then got some Coal from one of the Pits nearest thereunto, which I > distilled in a Retort in an open Fire. At first there came over only Phlegm, > afterwards a black Oil, and then likewise a Spirit arose, which I could > noways condense, but it forced my Lute, or broke my Glasses. Once, when it > had forced the Lute, coming close thereto, in order to try to repair it, I > observed that the Spirit which issued out caught Fire at the Flame of the > Candle, and continued burning with Violence as it issued out, in a Stream, > which 1 blew out, and lighted again, alternately, for several > times.Schivelbusch, Disenchanted Night, p. 15. Clayton's findings did not have any practical application until the end of the 18th century. The gas produced during the coking of coal was allowed to escape unused until William Murdoch began to promote coal gas as an illuminant. Other such experiments, though limited in depth, had been done by: George Dixon in 1780 in Cockfield, Jean-Pierre Minckelers in 1785 in Louvain, and Archibald Cochrane in 1787 at his estate Culross Abbey. The true prototypes for later gasworks were first constructed in 1802 at the Soho Foundry and in 1805 at George Lee's cotton mill in Salford close to Manchester. However innovative the new technology, it was met with great skepticism by many critics. As late as 1810 Murdock was asked in a committee of the House of Commons: \\"Do you mean to tell us that it will be possible to have a light without a wick?\\"Cited in Schivelbusch, Lichtblicke, p. 22 Not until the second decade of the 19th century did gaslight spread from industrial mills to urban street lighting and domestic lighting. Accum played a crucial role in this unfolding revolution.Browne, The life and chemical services of Frederick Accum, p. 1021. The first London gasworks 1814. Plate from Accum's A Practical Treatise on Gas Light (1815). The retorts are set transversely, directly under the chimney; the gasometer is on the left. Accum became involved with the production of gas for lighting purposes through the efforts of Friedrich Albert Winsor (1763‚Äì1830), another German √©migr√©, who had been waging a longstanding publicity campaign. In 1809, Accum was asked to appear before a Parliamentary committee that was considering granting a charter for a gaslight company Winsor had been promoting. While unsuccessful in its first attempt, the bill passed in 1810 and the company was incorporated under the name \\"Gas Light and Coke Company\\".On 5 May and 6 May 1809, Accum testified before a committee of the House of Commons. His testimony is reprinted in Browne, The life and chemical services of Frederick Accum, p. 1009‚àí1011. The newly incorporated company met the conditions laid out in the bill and began operating in 1812 with Accum as a member of its board of directors. Accum oversaw the construction of a gas plant on Curtain Road, which was the first such plant in the history of gaslight. After that time, gaslight was no longer limited to industrial mills and was introduced into urban life. Westminster Bridge was lighted with gas lamps in 1813, and a year later, the streets in Westminster followed. In 1815, Accum published \\"Description of the Process of Manufacturing Coal-Gas\\". In the introduction, Accum compared the newly formed gas utility with the water companies that had been operating in London since the early 18th century: \\"Through gas, it will be possible to have light in all rooms, as is presently the case with water.\\" When this book was translated into German in Berlin in 1815, an explanatory note had to be added, as no such water utilities existed there: \\"There are many private homes in England that are provided with pipes in the walls so that in almost all rooms, all one needs to do to get water is open a faucet.\\"For the German edition see: Praktische Abhandlung √ºber die Gaserleuchtung, Ausgabe Berlin o. J. (1815), cited by Schivelbusch, Lichtblicke, p. 33. In London, in 1814, there was a single gasometer of , by 1822, there were four gas companies, whose gasometers had a total combined volume of almost a million ft3Schivelbusch, Lichtblicke, p. 36. To keep delivery routes for the gas pipelines as short as possible, gas plants were set up within the city districts where the gas was consumed. The arrival of these types of chemical plants to inhabited parts of the city provoked public criticism of the new technology. This was also directed at poisonous effluent generated by the plant operations. These harsh critiques were especially fierce once accidental explosions occurred at some plants.Schivelbusch, Lichtblicke, p. 38‚Äì44. Accum, who by this point was a leading proponent of gaslight in addition to his work as a chemist, strongly refuted these criticisms in his writings. Through careful analysis he showed that as a whole, accidents were caused by carelessness of plant workerman rather than problems with the technology, and were therefore avoidable.Browne, The life and chemical services of Frederick Accum, p. 1013. From early on in its conception, Accum had been concerned with the byproducts of coal gas production, which included tar and sulphur compounds. These were typically buried or dumped into nearby waterways. The ammonium and sulphur compounds were especially damaging to the environment. In 1820, Accum began demanding legal measures to prevent the discharge of these byproducts into the sewage systems and rivers.Akos Paulinyi, Gasanstalten ‚Äì die Gro√üchemie in Wohnvierteln, in: Akos Paulinyi / Ulrich Troitzsch, Mechanisierung und Maschinisierung 1600 bis 1840, (Propyl√§en:Berlin) 1991, p. 423‚Äì428, see p. 427. His criticisms were met with few positive reactions. Various catastrophes due to gas explosions drew far more attention than the environmental impact of long term release of poisonous byproducts. =\\"There is death in the pot\\"= In 1820 Accum began the public struggle against harmful food additives with his book entitled A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons. Some additives derived from plants, and used as preservatives or to alter tastes or appearance, had already been in use for some time. The beginning of the 19th century saw a rapid increase in the industrial preparation and packaging of foods. The drastic increase of additives used in these processes became a serious health concern. The production and distribution of food, instead of being one between local farmers and townspeople, increasingly became a centralized process in large factories. The proliferation of newly discovered chemicals and the absence of laws moderating their use, made it possible for unscrupulous merchants to use them to boost profits at a cost to the public health.Owen R. Fennema: Food additives ‚Äì an unending controversy, in: The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 46 (1987), p. 201‚Äì203, see p. 201, available online as a PDF. Accum was the first to publicly proclaim the hazards of this practice and to reach a wide audience with his concerns.Browne, The life and chemical services of Frederick Accum, p. 1028. ‚ÄúThere is death in the pot‚Äù ‚àí Cover of Accum's book A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons (1820) Accum alludes to his moral stance on food adulterations as he claims that: > The man who robs a fellow subject of a few shillings on the high-way, is > sentenced to death; while he who distributes a slow poison to a whole > community, escapes punishment. A thousand copies of A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons were sold within a month of its publication.Von der Verf√§lschung der Nahrungsmittel und von den K√ºchengiften, Leipzig 1822, Preface to the second edition, p. xxiii. A second run was printed in the same year, and a German translation was printed in Leipzig two years later. The book's cover shows that Accum was capable of using dramatic imagery to try to draw attention to his scientific knowledge. It featured a rectangular frame supporting a spider's web and surrounded by intertwined snakes. A spider lurks in the middle of the web over its prey, and a skull crowns the entire collection with a caption beneath it, taken from 2 Kings 4:40: \\"There is death in the pot.\\" The various chapters of the book alternate between harmless forgeries such as mixing dried pea grounds in coffee, and much more dangerous contamination by truly poisonous substances. Accum explained to his readers that there was a high lead content in Spanish olive oil, caused by the lead containers used to clear the oil, and recommended using oil from other countries such as France and Italy, where this was not practiced.Von der Verf√§lschung der Nahrungsmittel und von den K√ºchengiften, Leipzig 1822, p. 222f. He warned against bright green sweets sold by itinerant merchants in the streets of London as the colour was produced with \\"sapgreen\\", a colorant with high copper content.Von der Verf√§lschung der Nahrungsmittel und von den K√ºchengiften, Leipzig 1822, p. 214f. \\"Vinegar\\", he explained to his readers, \\"was frequently mixed with sulphuric acid in order to increase its acidity.\\"Von der Verf√§lschung der Nahrungsmittel und von den K√ºchengiften, Leipzig 1822, p. 211. Accum paid particular attention to beer, introducing the subject with the comment: \\"Malt beverages, and especially port, the preferred drink of the inhabitants of London and other large cities, is among the items which is most frequently adulterated in the course of supply.\\"Von der Verf√§lschung der Nahrungsmittel und von den K√ºchengiften, Leipzig 1822, p. 97. He claimed that English beer was occasionally mixed with molasses, honey, vitriol, pepper and even opium. Among the most shocking customs he pointed out was the practice of adding fishberries, part of the family Menispermaceae, to port. It became evident during the French Revolutionary Wars that the practice was getting out of hand, and Accum attributed the intoxicating power of the drink to the addition of this plant matter.Von der Verf√§lschung der Nahrungsmittel und von den K√ºchengiften, Leipzig 1822, p. 104f. Accum used various sources to substantiate his claims. As evidence for his claims about Cocculus indicus he used, among others, import statistics, which he complemented with observations about when the price of Cocculus indicus from commodity price lists of brewing materials merchants increased. He also looked at historic price trends for the same commodities. The Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons has two further notable characteristics. First, like Accum's earlier writings, it was written with descriptions of the simple techniques of analytical chemistry he employed, thereby making them more accessible to his readers. He wanted to make every test repeatable in the simplest possible way by a non- expert. Accum wrote in the foreword to his first edition: > In stating the experimental proceedings necessary for the detection of the > frauds which it has been my object to expose, I have confined myself to the > task of pointing out such operations only as may be performed by persons > unacquainted with chemical science; and it has been my purpose to express > all necessary rules and instructions in the plainest language, divested of > those recondite terms of science, which would be out of place in a work > intended for general perusal.Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary > Poisons, London 1820, p. v. The second characteristic was that Accum did not limit his campaign to simply exposing problems. At the end of every chapter, he included names of merchants of who had in years prior to 1820 been caught adulterating foodstuffs. In this way, Accum tried to deprive them of business and thereby had an effect on the London economy.Browne, The life and chemical services of Frederick Accum, p. 1032. =Reaction to Treatise on Adulterations of Food= Accum was well aware before the publication of his book that mentioning specific names from London's business world would provoke a resistance and a possibly a severe reaction. In the foreword to the first edition he called the publication of the names of those adulterating foodstuffs an \\"invidious office\\" and a \\"painful duty,\\"Accum, A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons (1820) p. iv-v which he undertook as a verification for his statements. Although he further stated that he carefully avoided citing any except those authenticated in Parliamentary documents and other records,Accum, A Treatise on Adulterations of Food and Culinary Poisons (1820) p. v this did not save him from the ire of his opponents. By the time the second edition appeared, he mentioned in the foreword that he had received threats. At the same time, this did not stop him from putting \\"the unwary on their guard\\" against the deceits of unscrupulous men. He further added that he wished to notify his hidden enemies that he would report for posterity the crimes these swindlers and their base associates had been found guilty of in public justice--that is, of having made basic foodstuffs poisonous.Von der Verf√§lschung der Nahrungsmittel und von den K√ºchengiften, Leipzig 1822, p. xxiv. =Scandal and lawsuit= The process that ultimately led to Accum's departure from England and return to Germany began a few months after the publication of his book on the poisoning of foodstuffs. For a long time, many contradictory accounts have been given of the exact circumstances of his exile. Finally in 1951, R. J. Cole, in an addendum to the minutes of Royal Institution, proved that the presentation of the events adopted in the article in the Dictionary of National Biography, and also later in the Allgemeinen Deutschen BiographieAlphons Oppenheim, Friedrich Christian Accum, in: Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, (Historische Commission bei der K√∂nigl. Akademie der Wissenschaften:Leipzig) Vol. 1, p. 27, available online from the Bayerischen Staatsbibliothek Munich. (according to which Accum was embroiled in charges of embezzlement as librarian of the Royal Institution and escaped to Germany), did not correspond to the facts. Cole completely reprinted the minutes of an extraordinary meeting of the Royal Institution of 23 December 1820,Cole, Friedrich Accum, p. 137f.; ref. Minutes 1 and 2 of the extraordinary meeting of the Royal Institution on 23 December 1820, chaired by vice-president Charles Hatchett which show that these events were initiated through an observation made by a librarian of the Royal Institution named Sturt. Sturt reported to his superiors that on 5 November 1820, a number of pages were removed from books in the reading room of the institution, books Accum had read. On the instructions of his superiors, Sturt cut a small hole in the wall of the reading room to watch Accum from an adjoining room. On the evening of 20 December, as recorded in the minutes, Sturt could see Accum tear out and walk off with a paper concerning the ingredients and uses of chocolate. The paper had been in an issue of Nicholson‚Äôs Journal. Accum's premises on Old Compton Street were searched on the order of a magistrate for the City of London, and torn pages were indeed discovered there. These could be matched to books belonging to the Royal Institution. > The Magistrate after hearing the whole of the Case observed that however > valuable the books might be from which the leaves found in Mr Accum‚Äôs house > had been taken, yet the leaves separated from them were only waste paper. If > they had weighed a pound he would have committed him for the value of a > pound of waste paper, but this not being the case he discharged him.Cole, > Friedrich Accum, p. 138. The Royal Institution committee that met on 23 December 1820 was not, however, satisfied with this judgment, and decided to take further legal action against Accum. On 10 January 1821, an open letter directed to Earl Spencer, the president of the Institution, appeared in The Times defending Accum.The Times Number 11140, 10 January 1821, p. 3, available online at the Wikimedia Commons. The letter was signed \\"A.C\\", and Cole supposed that the author was the surgeon Anthony Carlisle, who had been friends with Accum since the first years of the latter's stay in London.Cole, Friedrich Accum, p. 140. This unsought support availed Accum little, as the minutes of the Royal Institution from 16 April 1821 show. These report the commencement of a lawsuit against Accum for theft of paper valued at 14 pence.\\"Mr Moore reported that a Bill of Indictment had been preferred at the last January Westminster Sessions against Frederick Accum for feloniously stealing and taking away 200 pieces of paper of the value of ten pence, and also for feloniously stealing and taking away four ounces weight of paper of the value of four pence, the property of the Members of the Royal Institution of Great Britain\\", Cole, Friedrich Accum, p. 140. Two of his friends were included in the indictment: the publisher Rudolph Ackermann and the architect John Papworth. These three appeared in court and paid altogether 400 pounds sterling as surety.From the minutes of the Royal Institution: \\"Mr Accum thereupon appeared in Court with his two Sureties Randolph [sic!] Ackermann of the Strand, Publisher, and John Papworth of Bath Place New Road, Architect, and entered into the usual Recognizances himself in ¬£200, and the Sureties in ¬£100 each.\\" Cole, Friedrich Accum, p. 140f. Accum did not make an appearance at the court session. He had fled England and returned to Germany. =Return to Germany= In the two years before his return to Germany, Accum had published a number of books dealing with nutrition chemistry. In 1820, he published two works, one on beer production (A Treatise on the Art of Brewing) and another on wine (A Treatise on the Art of Making Wine). The following year appeared Culinary Chemistry, in which Accum provided practical information about the scientific basis of cooking. He also published a book on bread (A Treatise on the Art of Making Good and Wholesome Bread). Even when he had returned to Germany, his works continued to be reprinted and were translated into French, Italian and German, reaching a wide readership in Europe, as well as in the US after it was reprinted there.Browne, The life and chemical services of Frederick Accum, p. 1022-4, 1145. Immediately upon his arrival in Germany, Accum went to the town of Althaldensleben. There, the industrialist Johann Gottlob Nathusius had acquired various estates and was using them to found a sprawling industrial settlement. Nathusius was a German pioneer in the field of sugar production from beets, and had established a factory for its production in that town between 1813 and 1816. It was probably Nathusius‚Äô extensive library and chemical laboratory that drew Accum. He remained only a short time in Althaldensleben, however, as he soon got a professorship at the Gewerbeinstitut and the Bauakademie in Berlin. His teaching in the areas of physics, chemistry, and mineralogy, were collected in the two volume work, Physische und chemische Beschaffenheit der Baumaterialien, deren Wahl, Verhalten und zweckm√§ssige Anwendung, published in Berlin in 1826. It was the only work Accum published originally in German.Browne, The life and chemical services of Frederick Accum, p. 1144-5. A few years after settling down in Berlin, Accum had a house built at 16 Marienstra√üe (later 21 Marienstra√üe), where he dwelt until his death. During his last years, he suffered from a bad case of gout, which ultimately led to his death. His illness took a serious turn for the worse in June 1838, and he rapidly deteriorated. On 28 June, approximately 16 years after he return to Germany, Accum died at the age of 69 in Berlin. He was buried there at the Dorotheenst√§dtischen Friedhof.Hans- J√ºrgen Mende: Lexikon Berliner Grabst√§tten, (Haude & Spener:Berlin) 2006, , p. 14. Bibliography and primary sources The first biographical sketch of Friedrich Accum's life was written by the American agricultural chemist and historian of science Charles Albert Browne, Jr. in 1925. He studied the life and works of Accum closely for ten years, which he was able to complement with information from civil and ecclesiastical sources in B√ºckeburg. His enthusiasm for the subject was so great that he traveled to Germany in July 1930 to meet with Hugo Otto Georg Hans Westphal (26 August 1873 ‚Äì 15 September 1934), a great-grandson of Accum's. Brown's last writing on the subject, which appeared in 1948 in Chymia, a journal for the history of chemistry, relied to a great extent on the information he gathered from Hugo Westphal. Three years later, R. J. Cole published an outline of Accum's life based on English sources. He was particularly concerned with bringing new information to light about the judicial process of 1821. Like Browne, Cole also provided relatively little data about the last part of Accum's life in Berlin. A modern presentation of Accum's life and works that fills in the lacuna in the available biographies has not been written. Lawson Cockroft of the Royal Society of Chemistry in London observed that Friedrich Accum was one of those chemists who, despite significant achievements in his lifetime, was by and large forgotten today. \\"Fredrick Accum is representative of a chemist who is largely forgotten these days but nevertheless contributed to important changes in society [...]\\". Black and white photograph of an oil painting by Samuel Drummond, from London. Probably the best known pictorial representation of Accum was an engraving by James Thomson made in July 1820 for the English journal European Magazine. It shows Accum sitting at a table close to a gas lamp. Thomson's engraving was probably based on an oil painting by the London portrait painter Samuel Drummond (1765‚Äì1844), who had shown Accum in a similar pose in a painting produced a few years prior to this. In addition, Accum's brother-in-law, the artist Wilhelm Strack, painted an oil portrait that shows Accum as a young man. A few letter fragments and documents relating to Accum still exist in his family's possession. A certificate from the Gesellschaft naturforschender Freunde (society of natural philosophical friends), based in Berlin and granting honorary membership to Accum, dated 1 November 1814, was made available online in 2006.Urkunde der Gesellschaft naturforschender Freunde Berlin vom 1.

Built 1982 The Minitel was a videotex online service accessible through telephone lines, and was the world's most successful online service prior to the World Wide Web. It was invented in Cesson-S√©vign√©, near Rennes in Brittany, France. The service was rolled out experimentally on 15 July 1980 in Saint-Malo, France, and from autumn 1980 in other areas, and introduced commercially throughout France in 1982 by the PTT (Postes, T√©l√©graphes et T√©l√©phones; divided since 1991 between France T√©l√©com and La Poste).\\"Minitel: The rise and fall of the France-wide web\\", Hugh Schofield, BBC News Magazine (Paris), 27 June 2012. From its early days, users could make online purchases, make train reservations, check stock prices, search the telephone directory, have a mail box, and chat in a similar way to what is now made possible by the World Wide Web. In February 2009, France T√©l√©com indicated the Minitel network still had 10 million monthly connections. France T√©l√©com retired the service on 30 June 2012. English translation)  Name  Officially TELETEL, the name Minitel is abbreviated from the French title of M√©dium interactif par num√©risation d'information t√©l√©phonique (Interactive medium for digitized information by telephone). Business model 1985 TELIC-1 Alcatel Minitel terminal with non-AZERTY keyboard In 1978, Postes, T√©l√©graphes et T√©l√©phones, the French PTT organisation, began designing the Minitel network. By distributing terminals that could access a nationwide electronic directory of telephone and address information, it hoped to increase use of the country's 23 million phone lines, and reduce the costs of printing printed phone books and employing directory assistance personnel. Millions of terminals were given for free (officially loans, and property of the PTT) to telephone subscribers. The telephone company emphasized ease of use; one observer wrote that \\"the Minitel terminal requires slightly more training than a toaster to operate\\". By offering a popular service on simple, free equipment, Minitel achieved high market penetration and avoided the chicken and the egg problem that prevented widespread adoption of such a system in the United States. In exchange for the terminal, Minitel owners would only be given the yellow pages (classified commercial listings, with advertisements). The white pages were accessible for free on Minitel, and they could be searched much faster than flipping through a paper directory. According to the PTT, during the first eight years of nationwide operation 8 billion francs was spent on purchasing terminals, a profit of 3,5 billion francs was made after deduction of payments passed on to information providers such as newspapers, and an average of 500 million francs annually was saved by printing fewer phone books. A trial with just 55 residential and business telephone customers using experimental terminals began in Saint-Malo on 15 July 1980, two days after 13 July presentation by Minitel to President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing. This expanded to 2,500 customers in other regions in autumn 1980. Starting in May 1981, 4,000 experimental terminals with a different design were distributed in Ille-et- Vilaine, and commercial service using Minitel terminals began in 1982. By early 1986 1.4 million terminals were connected to Minitel, with plans to distribute another million by the end of the year. To reduce opposition from newspapers worried about competition from an electronic network, they were allowed to establish the first consumer services on Minitel. Lib√©ration offered 24-hour online news, such as results from events at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles that occurred overnight in France. Providers advertised their own services in their own publications, which helped market the overall Minitel network. Others founded newspapers solely to create Minitel services. By 1988 three million terminals were installed, with 100,000 new units installed monthly. The telephone directory received 23 million calls monthly, with 40,000 updates daily. About 6,000 other services were available, with 250 added monthly. France T√©l√©com estimated that almost 9 million terminals‚Äîincluding web-enabled personal computers (Windows, Mac OS, and Linux)‚Äîhad access to the network at the end of 1999, and that it was used by 25 million people (of a total population of 60 million). Developed by 10,000 companies, in 1996, almost 26,000 different services were available.\\"On the Farms of France, the Death of a Pixelated Workhorse\\", Scott Sayare, New York Times, 27 June 2012 The telephone company only provided the white pages, otherwise building infrastructure for others to provide services. Minitel allowed access to various categories: * phone directory (free) * mail-order retail companies * airline or train ticket purchases * information services * databases * message boards * online dating services * computer games The development of Minitel spawned the creation of many start-up companies in a manner similar to the later dot-com bubble of World Wide Web-related companies. Similarly, many of those small companies floundered because of an overcrowded market or bad business practices (lack of infrastructure for online retailers). By 1985 games and electronic messaging were 42% of Minitel traffic, and messaging was 17% of traffic in 1988. Messageries roses (\\"pink messages\\", adult chat services hosted by operators pretending to be receptive women) were unexpectedly very popular, embarrassing government officials who preferred to discuss growing business usage of messaging. Widespread street advertising marketed services such as \\"3615 Sextel\\", \\"Jane\\", \\"kiss\\", \\"3615 penthouse\\", and \\"men\\". They and other pornographic sites were also criticized for their possible access by minors. The government chose not to enact coercive measures, however, stating that the regulation of the online activities of children was up to parents, not the government. The government did, however, levy a tax on pornographic online services. =Finances= Payment methods *Credit card for purchases *Telephone bill for surfing time: rates depend on the sites visited Users first subscribed to individual services, but traffic grew quickly after the telephone company offered a \\"kiosk\\" model (named after newsagent's shops). Minitel and voice charges appeared combined on the monthly telephone bill, with no breakout of fees. Service providers received two-thirds of the $10 an hour that customers typically paid as of 1988. As the telephone company handled bill collection, and users who did not pay bills lost telephone service, the customer acquisition cost for service providers was low. The single bill encouraged impulse shopping, in which users intending to use one service found and used others while browsing. As users' identities and services were anonymous, Minitel use was high at work where companies paid for telephone service. In 1985 France T√©l√©com earned 620 million francs (approximately $70 million) from Minitel. 2,000 private companies earned 289 million francs (about $35 million) during the year; Lib√©ration earned 2.5 million francs (about $300,000) from the service in September. In the late 1990s, Minitel connections were stable at 100 million a month plus 150 million online directory inquiries, in spite of growing use of the World Wide Web. In 1998, Minitel generated ‚Ç¨832 million ($1,121 million) of revenue, of which ‚Ç¨521 million was channelled by France T√©l√©com to service providers. Minitel sales in the late 1990s accounted for almost 15% of sales at La Redoute and 3 Suisses, France's biggest mail order companies. In 2005, the most popular Minitel application was Teleroute, the online real-time freight exchange, which accounted for nearly 8% of Minitel usage. In December 1985 Minitel users made more than 22 million calls, up 400% in one year. In 1994 they made 1,913 million Minitel calls, used the system for 110 million hours, and spent 6.6 billion francs. In 2005, there were 351 million calls for 18.5 million hours of connection, generating ‚Ç¨206 million of revenue, of which ‚Ç¨145 million were redistributed to 2,000 service providers (these numbers were declining at around 30% per year). There were still six million terminals owned by France T√©l√©com, which had been left with their users in order to avoid recycling problems. The main uses were banking and financial services, which benefit from Minitel's security features, and access to professional databases. France T√©l√©com mentions, as an example of usage, that 12 million updates to personal \\"carte vitale\\" health-care cards were made through Minitel. In 2007, revenue was well over $100 million. In 2010, ‚Ç¨30 million in revenues with 85% of those revenues going to service providers.\\"Farmers mourn death of French proto-internet\\", Agence France-Presse (AFP), ABC News (Australia), 29 June 2012 =Phonebook= The Saint Malo \\"Annuaire Electronique\\" in July 1980 The most popular service of the Minitel was the \\"Annuaire Electronique\\"; in 1985 about half of the calls on the network were to it. In May of that year a white pages directory for all 24 million telephone subscribers nationwide became available. It was accessible through the phone number 11; on 18 October 1996 (new French numbering system adopted), the access to the phone directory changed to 3611. Companies could add up to 3 lines of complementary information and a \\"prehistoric\\" website. Ads to the Minitel phone directory were sold by ODA (Office d'Annonces), today Solocal / Pages Jaunes Groupe in S√®vres France. In 1991, the \\"Minitel Website\\" for the Paris Sony Stores contained already over 100 pages. Today the 3611 Minitel Directory is replaced by the online white or yellow pages. On 11 February 2009, France T√©l√©com and PagesJaunes announced that they were to cancel plans to end the Minitel service in March 2009. Its directory assistance service was still being accessed over a million times a month. This was before France T√©l√©com retired the service on 30 June 2012, on account of operational cost and fewer customers due to lack of interest. Technology Teletel on a Thomson videotex terminal Minitel used computer terminals consisting of a text-only monochrome screen, a keyboard and a modem, packaged into a single tabletop unit. Minitel terminals could display rudimentary graphics using a set of predefined block graphics characters. Color units were later available for a fee, but remained seldom-used. Aftermarket printers were available. (English translation) Minitel used the existing Transpac network, but its popularity caused problems for the network's commercial users. After a severe disruption in June 1985, France T√©l√©com separated business traffic from T√©l√©tel, dedicated to the Minitel service. When connecting, the Minitel's integrated modem generally dialed a short code number connecting to a PAVI (Point d'Acc√®s VId√©otexte, \\"videotext access point\\") from the subscriber's analog telephone line. The PAVI in turn connected digitally via Transpac to the destination servers of the appropriate company or administration. In France the most common dial number was \\"3615\\", while \\"3617\\" was used by more expensive services. Minitel services names were often prefixed with this number to identify them as such. Billboard ads at the time often consisted of nothing more than an image, a company name, and a \\"3615\\" number; the fact that a Minitel service was being advertised was then clear by implication, similarly to the use of \\".com\\" for later web services. Minitel used a half- duplex asymmetric data transmission via its modem. It downlinked at 1200 bit/s (9 KB/min) and uplinked at 75 bit/s (0.6 KB/min). This allowed fast downloads, for the time. The system, which came to be known as \\"1275\\" was more correctly known as V.23. This system had been developed for general-purpose data communications, but was most commonly used for Minitel and equivalent services around the world. Technically, Minitel refers to the terminals, while the network is known as T√©l√©tel. Minitel terminals use the AZERTY keyboard most commonly used in France (as opposed to the QWERTY keyboard more common in the English-speaking world). Minitel and the Internet The extent to which Minitel enhanced or hindered the development of the Internet in France is widely debated. On the one hand, it included more than a thousand services, some of which predicted common applications on the modern Internet. For example, in 1986, French university students coordinated a national strike using Minitel, demonstrating an early use of digital communication devices for participatory technopolitical ends. Alternatively, the French government's attachment to the natively developed Minitel may have slowed the adoption of the Internet in France; in the 1990s there was a peak of nine million terminals and there were still 810,000 terminals in the country in 2012. In the short term, some resources at France Telecom (now Orange) were dedicated to the development of Minitel that might have otherwise been focused on Internet development. However, France Telecom's focus on Minitel had little or no long-term effect on adoption or development of internet- and web-based companies in France; France ranks roughly equal to the US and Germany in the current penetration of high-speed internet in households. Minitel in other countries *Belgium: Minitel was launched by Belgacom and delivered services led by Teleroute. Although it was used by businesses, it was rarely used by the public. The main reason was that the terminals were not offered for free as in France and that usage of the service was expensive (50 Euro cents a minute). *Brazil: Telebr√°s had a teletext service called \\"Videotexto\\" or \\"VTX\\" during the 1980s and 1990s with services provided by local telephone companies such as Telesp (now part of Telef√¥nica Vivo). Services included chats, games, telephone list search, and electronic banking, among others. The Minitel protocol is still used by some cable TV companies to provide general information to their customers. *Canada: Bell Canada experimented with a Minitel-like system known as Alex with terminals called AlexTel. The system was conceptually similar to Minitel, but used the Canadian NAPLPS protocols and North American Bell System RJ-11 standard telephone connectors. Originally launched experimentally in the Montreal area, Alex was then launched in most areas served by Bell Canada (primarily Ontario and Quebec) with offers of a free trial period and terminal. The principal information offering was the telephone directory. Although branded as a \\"bilingual\\" (English and French Canadian) service, the majority of other services offered were the experimental ones originally offered in Quebec and completely Francophone. Retention rates were reportedly close to zero. The service closed down shortly after exiting the experimental stage. Telidon was an earlier Canadian text and graphics service using the same technological underpinnings. *Finland: In 1986, PTL-Tele, then Sonera (now part of Telia Company) launched the on-line service called TeleSampo. TeleSampo included not only videotex services, but also many other Ascii-based Value Added Services (VAS). Roughly at the same time, HPY HTF (now Elisa) launched a videotex service called Infotel (fi). TeleSampo service was switched off in 2004. *Germany: \\"Bildschirmtext\\" (BTX) that existed between 1983 and 2001 is almost as old as Minitel and technically very similar, but it was largely unsuccessful because consumers had to buy expensive decoders to use it. The German postal service held a monopoly on the decoders that prevented competition and lower prices. Few people bought the boxes, so there was little incentive for companies to post content, which in turn did nothing to further box sales. When the monopoly was loosened, it was too late because PC-based online services had started to appear. *Ireland: Minitel was introduced to Ireland by Eir (then called Telecom √âireann) in 1988. The system was based on the French model and Irish services were even accessible from France via the code \\"36 19 Irlande\\". A number of major Irish businesses came together to offer a range of online services, including directory information, shopping, banking, hotel reservations, airline reservations, news, weather and information services. The system was also the first platform in Ireland to offer users access to e-mail outside of a corporate setting. Despite being cutting edge for its time, the system failed to capture a large market and was ultimately withdrawn due to lack of commercial interest. The rise of the internet and other global online services in the early to mid-1990s played a major factor in the death of Irish Minitel. Minitel Ireland's terminals were technically identical to their French counterparts, except that they had a Qwerty keyboard and an RJ-11 telephone jack which is the standard telephone connector in Ireland. Terminals could be rented for 5.00 Irish pounds (6.35 euros) per month or purchased for 250.00 Irish pounds (317.43 euros) in 1992. *Italy: In 1985 the national telephone operator SIP ‚Äì Societ√† italiana per l'esercizio telefonico (now known as Telecom Italia) launched the Videotel (it) service. The system use was charged on a per-page basis. Due to the excessive cost of the hardware and the expensive services, diffusion was very low, leading to the diffusion of a FidoNet-oriented movement. The service was shut down in 1994. *Netherlands: The then state-owned phone company PTT (now KPN) operated two platforms: Viditel (nl) and Videotex Nederland (nl). The main difference was that Viditel used one big central host where Videotex NL used a central access system responsible for realizing the correct connection to the required host: owned and managed by others. Viditel was introduced on 7 August 1980, and required a Vidimodem as well as a compatible home computer (one such example was the Philips P2000T which had a built-in Teletext chip) or a television set which could support Teletext; the required equipment itself would cost anywhere between 3000 and 5000 Dutch guilders overall. Viditel was shut down in September 1989 due to high operating costs and was succeeded by the cheaper and more widely used Videotex Nederland. The Videotex NL services offered access via several premium rate numbers and the information/service provider could choose the costs for accessing his service. Depending on the number used, the tariff could vary from 0‚Äì1 guilders (0.00‚Äì0.45 euro) per minute. Some private networks such as Travelnet (for travel-agencies) and RDWNet for automotive industry, used the same platform as Videotex NL but used dedicated dial-in phone numbers, dedicated access-hardware and also used authentication. Although the protocol used in France for Minitel was slightly different than the international standard you could use the 'international' terminal (or PC's with the correct terminal-emulation software) to access the French services. It was possible to connect to most French Minitel services via the Dutch Videotex NL network, but the price per minute was considerably higher: most French Minitel services were reachable via the dial-in number 06-7900 which had a tariff of 1 guilder/minute (approx. ‚Ç¨0,45/minute). Videotex Nederland was eventually shut down in 1997, and the parent company behind Videotex Nederland was subsequently renamed as Planet Media Group. *Singapore: Singapore Teleview was first trialled by the Telecom Authority of Singapore (now Singtel) beginning in 1987, and was formally launched in 1991. The Teleview system, while similar in concept to the Minitel and Prestel, was unique in that it was able to display photographic images instead of graphical images used by Minitel and Prestel. Teleview was eventually rendered obsolete by SLIP/PPP-based modem Internet connections in the late-1990s. *South Africa: Videotex was introduced by Telkom in 1986 and named Beltel. The Minitel was introduced later to popularise the service. *Spain: Videotex was introduced by Telef√≥nica in 1990 and named Ibertex. The Ibertex was based on the French model but used the German Bildschirmtext CEPT-1 profile.REDES DE SERVICIOS TELEMATICOS: En Ibertex se reciben p√°ginas de informaci√≥n bajo la norma CEPT-1, el est√°ndar m√°s avanzado que existe en videotex, que permite gr√°ficos pero no sonido. *Sweden: Swedish state-owned telephone company Televerket (now Telia Company) introduced a similar service, called Teleguide (sv), in 1991. Teleguide was shut down in 1993 due to a contract dispute between Televerket and the vendors IBM and Esselte. *United Kingdom: The Prestel system was similar in concept to Minitel, using dedicated terminals or software on personal computers to access the network. *United States: In 1991, France T√©l√©com launched a Minitel service called \\"101 Online\\" in San Francisco; this venture was not successful.101 Online: American Minitel Network and Lessons from Its Failure In the early 1990s US West (subsequently Qwest and now CenturyLink) launched a Minitel service in the Minneapolis and Omaha markets called \\"CommunityLink\\". This joint venture of US West and France T√©l√©com provided Minitel content to IBM PC, Commodore 64 and Apple II owners using a Minitel-emulating software application over a dialup modem. Many of the individual services were the same as or similar to those offered by France T√©l√©com to the French market; in fact, some chat services linked up with France T√©l√©com's network in France. The service was fairly short-lived as competing offerings from providers like AOL, Prodigy, and CompuServe provided more services targeted at American users for a lower price. Many of US West's Minitel offerings were charged √† la carte or hourly while competitors offered monthly all-inclusive pricing.

It was formed from the amalgamation of seven offshore islands, the islands of Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau Ayer Merbau, Pulau Merlimau, Pulau Pesek, Pulau Pesek Kechil (also called Terumbu Pesek), Pulau Sakra (which was a previous merger of Pulau Sakra and Pulau Bakau), Pulau Seraya, Pulau Meskol, Pulau Mesemut Laut, Pulau Mesemut Darat and Anak Pulau. This was done through Singapore's land reclamation efforts. Land reclamation on Jurong Island was completed on 25 September 2009, 20 years earlier than scheduled. Pulau Buaya was joined to Jurong Island via reclamation in 2010. Jurong Island forms a land area of about from an initial area of less than , and is the largest of Singapore's outlying islands. History Extract from Singapore Map - 1945 The outlying islands of Pulau Ayer Chawan, Pulau Ayer Merbau, Pulau Merlimau and Pulau Seraya were used to house fishing communities comprising small villages up to the 1960s. The villagers lived in Malay-style wooden stilt houses on the palm-fringed islands. Between the late-1960s and early-1970s, three big oil companies planned to house their facilities on Pulau Ayer Chawan for Esso, Pulau Merlimau for Singapore Refinery Company and Pulau Pesek for Mobil Oil. The Government of Singapore then took the opportunity to grow the petrochemical industry as a choice that would significantly produce economic growth. This was proven by the success of starting off the petroleum industries in the 1970s. By the 1980s, after a decade of rapid industrialisation, industrial land was growing scarce on Singapore mainland. The idea of joining the southern islands off Jurong to form one colossal island to create more industrial land was therefore conceived. In 1991, JTC Corporation (formerly Jurong Town Corporation) was appointed the agent of the Jurong Island project. JTC planned and coordinated with various government agencies in providing the necessary infrastructure and services to the island. Physical land reclamation began in 1995, and Jurong Island was officially opened on 14 October 2000 by then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. From the 9.91 km¬≤ land area of the original seven islets, as of completion of the land reclamation on 25 September 2009, Jurong Island currently has a total land area of 30 km¬≤. Penta-Ocean Construction was the major contractor and reclamation was completed 20 years ahead of schedule. Petrochemical industries Today, Jurong Island is home to many companies such as LANXESS, Afton Chemical, BASF, BP, Celanese, Evonik, ExxonMobil, DuPont, Mitsui Chemicals, Chevron Oronite, Shell, Singapore Petroleum Company Singapore Refining Company, Stepan Company, Petrochemical Corporation of Singapore, The Polyolefin Company, Chevron Phillips, Mitsui Elastomer and Sumitomo Chemical. Clusters of gigantic cylindrical tanks amid a maze of pipelines now dot the island; investment totalled S$31 billion in 2010. Resident companies produce a vast range of items, from petroleum products to polycarbonate resins used in CDs, DVDs and LCD TV panels, and super-absorbent polymers that go into diapers and sanitary napkins. ExxonMobil, which has invested S$4 billion in a refinery and cracker plant, makes industrial and automotive lubricants including a product used in Formula One racing cars. DuPont has invested S$1 billion, and manufactures Zytel nylon resin, a versatile engineering plastic used in automobile components, appliances, wire insulation, sporting gear and home furnishings. Afton Chemical is constructing a new manufacturing facility, expected to become operational in January 2016, to produce petroleum additives for the Asia-Pacific and Middle East markets. Output for the chemicals cluster--which cover oil and gas, petrochemicals and speciality chemicals--totalled S$66.5 billion in 2005, an increase of 31 per cent from 2004. This accounted for almost 32 per cent of production in Singapore's manufacturing sector. Powered by the cluster, Singapore is currently one of the world's top three oil refining centres despite not having a single drop of crude deposits. Jurong Island's refineries process of crude oil per day, turning it into petrol, kerosene and jet fuel sold locally and abroad. Cracker plants break down the molecules of other oil-and gas-related substances such as naphtha into additives that give unique characteristics to certain products, from printer inks to plastic mouldings, semiconductors and aircraft materials. Apart from imported crude, natural gas from Indonesia's West Natuna field arrives at Jurong Island via a 640 km undersea pipeline. Some of it is refined to provide a source of cleaner and cheaper fuel, while the rest is sent to crackers that make other petrochemical products. The country's first refilling station for compressed natural gas (CNG) opened on Jurong Island in 2002. As most of the 2500+ cars running on CNG in Singapore are not allowed to enter the island because the drivers do not have the necessary security pass, four more CNG stations opened on the main island leading up to September 2009. Jurong Island lies in the background of this panoramic view of Jurong Industrial Estate. The Jurong Pier Flyover and the island of Pulau Damar Laut, with Jurong Island Highway that leads to Jurong Island, can be seen on the left. Security Jurong Island was gazetted as a Protected Place in October 2001 following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in the United States. Access control is contracted to a private security company, while the Singapore Army helps to protect the island. The Police Coast Guard also conducts regular patrols around the island to ensure no unauthorised vessels are allowed access within a restricted area of waters surrounding it. Access to the island is limited to staff and visitors, and they are issued with security passes. Other security restrictions include that any photographic equipment brought to the island must be declared. Without permission from Island Security it is forbidden to take photographs or videos on Jurong Island. Anyone getting caught taking pictures or videos is handed over to the police, and subsequently has their Jurong Island pass confiscated and their permission to enter Jurong Island revoked. Jurong Island and the southwestern waters were to be used for Exercise Northstar 8 from 21 November to 25 November 2011. However, Exercise Northstar 8 was only carried out on 25 November 2011 after 4pm at Jurong Island, up to 7.30pm. Infrastructure Jurong Island has two fire stations, and an amenity centre known as Oasis@Sakra that houses a food court, a medical clinic and a free-of-charge multi-storey carpark. The island also houses the Pulau Seraya Power Station, Singapore's first offshore power station, which was built in phases on the former Pulau Seraya since 1986. The island has a network of pipelines that allows for seamless integration among companies. For example, Japan's Teijin can make polycarbonates from chlorine piped in directly from CIFE and bisphenol A from Mitsui Chemicals elsewhere on the island. Red pipes carry water for firefighting and green pipes, sea water for cooling. Huge silver pipes carry steam and small silver pipes bring product lines. There are two major cargo jetties on Jurong Island, namely Sakra Jetty and Banyan Jetty. Sakra Jetty is managed and controlled by ExxonMobil. Jurong Island is linked to the main island by a 2.3 km causeway known as the Jurong Island Highway, opened in March 1999. Several public bus services run between Jurong Island and the mainland, operated by Woodlands Transport.http://landtransportguru.net/bus/bus-services/ Jurong Rock Caverns Construction work on Jurong Rock Caverns (JRC), Singapore's first underground rock caverns for storage of crude oil, condensates, naphtha and gas-oil, started on 8 February 2007. JTC Corporation has been appointed by the Singapore government to undertake the construction of JRC. Located beneath the seabed of Banyan Basin, off Jurong Island, JRC was completed in phases beginning in 2013, and was officially opened on 2 September 2014. As a result of this first phase of work, the caverns reportedly have a storage capacity of 1.47 million cubic metres.Paul Jacob, \\"PM eyes S'pore-Saudi logistics tie- ups\\", The Sunday Times, 26 November 2006 Phase 2, which has the potential to add another 1.32 million cubic metres, is being explored. Plans To raise its competitive edge, Singapore is moving to produce higher-value-added speciality products, including chemicals that would go into animal vaccines, animal feeds, consumer care items such as cosmetics and industrial enzymes to support the biomedical sector. As part of this effort to move up the value chain, the Institute of Chemical and Engineering Science (an A*STAR research institute) has been set up on Jurong Island. There have also been plans to build a second causeway to link the Western end of Jurong Island Highway with Gul Road in Jurong Industrial Estate on mainland Singapore, but these have been shelved. The investment earmarked for the second causeway has been re- allocated to the building of HDB flats at Western Water Catchment later in the decade.

His principal discovery was the production of sugar from sugar beets.Achard (1799) \\"Proc√©d√© d'extraction du sucre de bette\\" (Process for extracting sugar from beets), Annales de Chimie, 32 : 163-168.  Life and work  Achard was born in Berlin, the son of preacher Max Guillaume Achard, a descendant of Huguenot refugees, and his wife Marguerite Elisabeth (Rouppert). He studied physics and chemistry in Berlin. He became interested in sugar refining through his stepfather. At the age of 20, Achard entered the \\"Circle of Friends of Natural Sciences\\" and met Andreas Sigismund Marggraf, then director of the physical classes at the Royal Academy of Sciences. Achard studied many subjects, including meteorology, evaporation chillness, electricity, telegraphy, gravity, lightning arresters, and published in German and French. Achard was a favourite of King Frederick II of Prussia, and directly reported to the King on his research twice a week. About a study on the influence of electricity on mental capabilities, Frederick II was reported to have said: If he is able to provide reason for the half-wits in my Prussian states using electricity, then he is worth more than his own weight in gold. In 1776 Achard was elected to the Royal Academy of Sciences at Berlin. In 1778, Achard was elected as member of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.https://www.leopoldina.org/de/mitglieder/mitgliederverzeichnis/member/1544/Following the death of Marggraf in 1782, Archard went on to become the director of the physical classes of the academy. In 1782 he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. For his discoveries in the acclimatisation of tobacco to Germany, the king granted him a lifetime pension of 500 taler. Achard was also esteemed by Frederick William II of Prussia. Achard, Chimistes Celebres, Liebig's Extract of Meat Company Trading Card, 1929 Achard revived the discovery by Marggraf in 1747 that sugar beets contained sugar, and devised a process to produce sugar from sugar beets. Beginning in 1789, he planted various sugar-bearing plants on his manor in Kaulsdorf near Berlin. He soon preferred sugar beets because of their efficiency. In the following year he studied different varieties of beets and the influence of fertilisers. The research was interrupted when Kaulsdorf manor burnt down and had to be sold. Achard later continued on the manor Franz√∂sisch Buchholz. In 1801, with the support of King Friedrich Wilhelm III, he opened the first sugar beet refinery at Gut Kunern near SteinauSugar Beet Factory at Gut Kunern Silesia, Prussia.Chambers Biographical Dictionary, , page 6 In 1802, the refinery processed 400 tons of beets with a degree of efficiency of 4%. Other refineries were soon built by his students Johann Gottlob Nathusius and Moritz, Freiherr von Koppy. In 1807 Achard's plant was burned down during the Napoleonic Wars and in 1810 it was rebuilt on a small scale. Embargoes by Napoleon kept cane sugar imports away from Germany and thus the growing and refining of sugar beets became highly important for the Prussian government. Refineries also appeared in Bohemia, Augsburg and in 1811 in France. France itself built many refineries and was only in later years surpassed by Prussia. English sugar merchants offered Achard 200,000 taler to declare his experiments a failure but he refused. With Achard's discovery, sugar was no longer a luxury product, but local production became a necessity, due to the embargoes. Achard taught classes to have a large number of sugar beet growers and the specially developed sugar beets became available for everyone. Achard described the sugar beet as, \\"one of the most bountiful gifts which the devine munificence had awarded to man on earth.\\"The Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol I, London, George Woodfall and Son, 1847, p.119. In 1794, Achard built an optical telegraph between Spandau and Bellevue. This device had been invented just one year before by Claude Chappe. Due to Archard's financial difficulties as a result of several fires in 1807, his refineries were declared bankrupt in 1815. He died, destitute, in 1821 in Wohlau. His life's work was carried on mainly by French industrialists such as at the refineries of Matthias Christian Rabbethge. In mid 19th century America, Achard's grandson Anton William Waldemar Achard successfully promoted beet sugar production in Michigan according to a later descendant, Emil Lockwood,Mills, James Cook, History of Saginaw County Michigan (Seeman & Peters Publishers, 1918), 467, as cited in MAN IN MOTION: Michigan's Legendary Senate Majority Leader, Emil Lockwood by Stanley C. and Marilyn H.

Kaduruwela area is the Polonnaruwa New Town and the other part of Polonnaruwa remains as the royal ancient city of the Kingdom of Polonnaruwa. The second most ancient of Sri Lanka's kingdoms, Polonnaruwa was first established by the Chola dynasty after their successful invasion of the country's then capital, Anuradhapura, in the 10th century. The Ancient City of Polonnaruwa has been declared a World Heritage Site. Currently the new Polonnaruwa is undergoing a major development project known as the \\"Awakening of Polonnaruwa\\" under the concept of President Maithripala Sirisena. It envisions the development of all sectors in Polonnaruwa including roads, electricity, agriculture, education, health and environment will be developed comprehensively.  Etymology  The name Polonnaruwa is of unknown origin and was adopted by the traveller James Emerson Tennent. Its Tamil form, Pulainari, is mentioned in Tamil inscriptions found at Polonnaruwa of the Chola period. The name was perhaps a contraction of its ancient name Pulastya nagara or Pulatti nakaram meaning city of the Hindu sage Pulastya. It was renamed under Chola rule as Jananathapuram or Jananathamangalam. The place was later known as Vijayarajapuram as mentioned in the records of Jayabahu I, which probably was derived from the name of Vijayabahu I.  Demographic  Polonnaruwa Town is Sinhalese majority. Muslims form second largest group. There are also small numbers of Sri Lankan Tamils and Indian Tamils. Others including Burgher and Malay. = Ethnicity according to Polonnaruwa Town (2012) = Source:statistics.gov.lk History Polonnaruwa was established by the Cholas as capital city under the name Jananathapuram in the 10th century. Under this period systematic destruction of the Buddhist civilisation took place in the northern plains of Sri Lanka. Raja Raja Chola I built Vanavan Mahadevisvaram, a Shiva temple at Polonnaruwa named after his queen, which presently is known as Siva Devale. The temple among other contained Ganesha and Parvati statues of bronze. north and central parts of Sri Lanka was under this period ruled under Rajendra Chola I directly as a Chola province. However, following the year 1070 AD ended the Chola rule in the island, and Polonnaruwa was captured by Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa also known as Vijayabahu the great. Starting from Mahanagakula on the south of the Walawe river, Vijayabahu dispatched three armies to attack Polonnaruwa from three fronts. One army was sent along the western shore of the country to Mahathittha port to deal with any reinforcements arriving from South India. Afterwards, part of this army moved towards Polonnaruwa and attacked from the North-west, while the other part held the ports to prevent reinforcements from arriving. A second army was sent from the east across Magama to attack Polonnaruwa from the east. The third and main force advanced across the country, led by the king. Surrounded by these three armies, Polonnaruwa was besieged for seven months before king Vijayabahu‚Äôs forces entered the city. In 1070, Vijayabahu became the ruler of Polonnaruwa. At that time Sri Lanka was known as Thambapanni. Trade and agriculture flourished under the patronage of the famous grand son of king Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa, king Prakramabahu the great, who was so adamant that no drop of water falling from the heavens was to be wasted and each was to be used toward the development of the land. Hence, irrigation systems that are far superior to those of the Anuradhapura Age were constructed during Parakramabahu's reign ‚Äì systems which to this day supply the water necessary for paddy cultivation during the scorching dry season in the east of the country. The greatest of these systems is the Parakrama Samudra or the Sea of Parakrama which were also used as a large sea going ship anchorage via Mahaweli River. The Kingdom of Polonnaruwa was completely self-sufficient during King Parakramabahu's reign. With the exception of his immediate successor, Nissankamalla I, all other monarchs of Polonnaruwa were slightly weak-willed and rather prone to picking fights within their own court. They also went on to form more intimate matrimonial alliances with stronger South Indian kingdoms until these matrimonial links superseded the local royal lineage. This prompted an invasion by the Aryacakravarti dynasty war load Kalinga Magha in 1214, who saw the complete destruction of the metropolises of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa by burning. Kalinga Magha by the time of his defeat had destroyed the Buddhist civilization in north of Sri Lanka. Present day Today the ancient city of Polonnaruwa remains one of the best planned archaeological relic cities in the country, standing testimony to the discipline and greatness of the Kingdom's first rulers. Its beauty was also used as a backdrop to filmed scenes for the Duran Duran music video Save a Prayer in 1982. The ancient city of Polonnaruwa has been declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO. Near the ancient city, there is a small town with several hotels (especially for tourists) and some glossy shops, and places to fulfill day-to-day needs. There are government institutions in a newly built area called ‚Äúnew town,‚Äù about 6 km away from the town and the main road. The largest school in the district, Polonnaruwa Royal Central College is situated at new town. Polonnaruwa is the second largest city in North Central Province, but it is known as one of the cleanest and more beautiful cities in the country. The green environment, amazing ancient constructions, Parakrama Samudra (a huge lake built in 1200), and attractive tourist hotels and hospitable people, attract tourists. Another draw for tourists is the city's population of toque macaques. The monkeys have been living in the ruins since human occupation and continue to thrive here long after the humans left.

It administers the various statutes pertaining to money, banking, insurance, securities and the financial sector in general, as well as currency issuance. It was established in 1971 to act as the Singapore Government's banker. MAS Building on Shenton Way, headquarters of the Monetary Authority of Singapore. History The MAS was founded in 1971 to oversee various monetary functions associated with banking and finance. Before its establishment, monetary functions were performed by government departments and agencies. The acronym for its name resembles mas, the word for 'gold' in Malay, Singapore's national language ‚Äì although it is not pronounced in the same way. As Singapore progressed, an increasingly complex banking and monetary environment required more dynamic and coherent monetary administration. Therefore, in 1970, the Parliament of Singapore passed the Monetary Authority of Singapore Act leading to the formation of MAS on 1 January 1971. The act gives MAS the authority to regulate all elements of monetary policy, banking, and finance in Singapore. During the COVID-19 pandemic MAS brought forward its twice yearly meeting from some time in April to 30 March. The MAS decided to ease the Singapore dollar's appreciation rate to zero percent, as well as adjust the policy band downwards, the first such move since the Global Financial Crisis. This makes it the first time the MAS had taken these two measures together.

It carries this out by intervening in the SGD market as well as other operations in the money market. The MAS reviews its policy stance less frequently than most central banks, in a cycle that is around every 6 months. Issuing Banknotes and Coins Following its merger with the Board of Commissioners of Currency on 1 October 2002, the MAS assumed the function of currency issuance. MAS has the exclusive right to issue banknotes and coins in the Republic of Singapore. Their dimensions, designs and denominations are determined by the Monetary Policy Committee with Government approval. The banknotes and coins thus issued have the status of legal tender within the country for all transactions, both public and private, without limitation.

It was founded in 1791 and is among the oldest universities in the United States as it was the fifth institution of higher education established in the New England region of the U.S. northeast. It is also listed as one of the original eight \\"Public Ivy\\" institutions in the United States. It is classified among \\"R2: Doctoral Universities ‚Äì High research activity\\". The university's Dudley H. Davis Center was the first student center in the United States to receive a Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certification. The largest hospital complex in Vermont, the University of Vermont Medical Center, has its primary facility on the UVM campus and is affiliated with the Robert Larner College of Medicine. History Old Mill, the oldest building of the university The University of Vermont was founded as a private university in 1791, the same year Vermont became the 14th U.S. state. The university enrolled its first students 10 years later. Its first president, The Rev. Daniel C. Sanders, was hired in 1800, and served as the sole faculty member for seven years. Instruction began in 1801, and the first class graduated in 1804. In 1865, the university merged with Vermont Agricultural College (chartered November 22, 1864, after the passage of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act), emerging as the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College. The University was granted 150,000 acres, which it sold for $122,626. The University of Vermont draws 6.8 percent of its annual budget of about $600 million from the State of Vermont and Vermont residents make up 35 percent of enrollment, while 65 percent of students come from elsewhere. Much of the initial funding and planning for the university was undertaken by Ira Allen, who is honored as UVM's founder. Allen donated a parcel of land for establishment of the university. Most of this land has been maintained as the university's main green, where stands a statue of Allen. The Billings Memorial Library was built in 1883 and was the university's library until 1961 when the larger Guy W. Bailey library was built. Since then, it has served miscellaneous purposes. The citizens of Burlington helped fund the university's first edifice, and, when it was destroyed by fire in 1824, also paid for its replacement. This building came to be known as \\"Old Mill\\" for its resemblance to New England mills of the time. The Marquis de Lafayette, a French general who became a commander in the American Revolution, toured all 24 U.S. states in 1824-1825 and while in Vermont laid the cornerstone of Old Mill, which stands on University Row, along with Ira Allen Chapel, Billings Library, Williams Hall, Royall Tyler Theatre and Morrill Hall. A statue of Lafayette stands at the north end of the main green. The University of Vermont was the first American college or university with a charter declaring that the \\"rules, regulations, and by-laws shall not tend to give preference to any religious sect or denomination whatsoever.\\" In 1871, UVM defied custom and admitted two women as students. Four years later, it was the first American university to admit women to full membership into the Phi Beta Kappa Society, the country's oldest collegiate academic honor society. Likewise, in 1877, it initiated the first African American into the society. Named for U.S. Senator Justin Smith Morrill, Morrill Hall was constructed in 1906-07 to serve as the home of the UVM Agriculture Department and the Agricultural Experiment Station. Justin Smith Morrill, a U.S. Representative (1855-1867) and Senator (1867-1898) from Vermont, author of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act that created federal funding for establishing the U.S. Land-Grant colleges and universities, served as a trustee of the university from 1865 to 1898. In 1924, the first radio broadcast in Vermont occurred from the college station, WCAX, run by students then, now the call sign of a commercial television station. For 73 years, until 1969, UVM held an annual \\"Kake Walk‚Äù where students wore blackface. Seal The university first adopted an official seal in 1807. The seal depicts the sun rising over the Green Mountains with the original college edifice, now the remodeled Old Mill. It includes a diagram of Euclid's \\"windmill proof\\" of the Pythagorean Theorem, a globe, and a sextant. It includes the motto \\"Universitas V. Montis. A.D. 1791\\" in the outer ring \\"Collegiumque Agriculturae\\" in the inner one, noting the establishment of the College of Agriculture in 1865.https://www.uvm.edu/sites/default/files/UVM- Policies/policies/universityseal.pdf Academics UVM research vessel docked near ECHO Aquarium, in Burlington harbor along Lake Champlain.

Sustainability The University of Vermont has a long history toward operational environmental sustainability on its campus. In 1995, the Environmental Council at UVM was established to fill a gap regarding a bridge between operations and academics on campus greening issues. The first Council project was to hear presentations from the various environmental programs on campus to provide a baseline scan of campus operation environmental impact. Greening UVM was published in 1998 by the Council to establish a baseline on the environmental impact of the campus' operations. During the same year, a Recycled Paper Policy was created and was implemented in 1999. As a community stakeholder in the Lab-XL project, the Environmental Council received an EPA grant to support the Tracking UVM project and publication to assess relative environmental impact and community interest in laboratory chemical waste. Tracking UVM, a follow-up to the Greening UVM report, was published in 2002 and reported on the environmental progress of the university from 1990 to 2000. The University of Vermont's commitment to tracking its environmental performance was recognized in 2004 with Vermont's Governor's Award for Environmental Excellence for this 2002 environmental report card. Tracking UVM is one of the first report cards that track the environmental impact of campus operations in an institution of higher education. In 2005, UVM's President Daniel M. Fogel signed the institution's Green Building Policy. The Recycled Paper Policy was updated in 2006 after two students pushed for the university to commit to purchasing 100 percent post-consumer, chlorine-free paper for routine copying and printing. In 2007, President Fogel signs on to the American College and University Presidents' Climate Commitment. The American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment (ACUPCC) is a high- visibility effort to address global climate disruption undertaken by a network of colleges and universities that have made institutional commitments to eliminate net greenhouse gas emissions from specified campus operations, and to promote the research and educational efforts of higher education to equip society to re-stabilize the earth's climate. Its mission is to accelerate progress towards climate neutrality and sustainability by empowering the higher education sector to educate students, create solutions, and provide leadership-by-example for the rest of society. In 2008, UVM dissolved the Environmental Council and established the Office of Sustainability. The Office of Sustainability aims to foster sustainable development and promote environmental responsibility at the University of Vermont by strategically bridging the academic activities of teaching, research, and outreach with the operations of the university. The sustainability office reports jointly to the Provost and to the Vice President for Finance & Administration, who supervises the director. There are two full-time staff and four Graduate Fellows, plus an Academic Advisor and a team of supporters. In 2011, UVM released its Climate Action Plan to the American College & University President's Climate Commitment. The climate action plan focuses on the direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the institution's operations. The target dates for UVM's climate action plan are 2015 for 100% carbon neutral electricity (Scope 1) and 2020 for carbon neutral heating, cooling, and fleet (Scope 2). UVM aims to target the net zero emissions for its \\"Scope 3\\" sources by 2025. In 2012, UVM became one of the first institutions nationwide to end the sale of bottled water on campus and mandate that one-third of drinks offered in vending machines be healthy options. During the same year, UVM's Board of Trustees passed a resolution to earmark $13 million for the fund, making it the largest challenge to date. Harvard's $12 million green loan fund had been the largest. In March 2012, UVM became 5th school in the nation to sign the \\"Real Food Campus Commitment\\", pledging to purchase 20 percent real food by 2020. In April 2017, UVM announced it had surpassed this goal and set a new goal to source 25 percent Real Food by 2020. The Certification for Sustainable Transportation (CST) was founded in 2012 to help improve economic, environmental, and energy efficiency within the passenger transportation sector. The CST is a direct outgrowth of work that began at the University of Vermont (UVM) in 2005 and now houses the eRating certification, driver trainings, and an array of awareness and education programs. It is a nonprofit operating out of UVM's Extensions office.About Us. Erating.org. Retrieved on 2014-04-12. The Lawrence Debate Union The university's debate team, which competes in both the American policy debate and British parliamentary debate formats, is one of the oldest organizations on campus, and receives funding from a private grant established in 1899. The Lawrence Debate Union has sent students abroad to promote cultural understanding. In 2007, students traveled to Slovenia, Malaysia, and Thailand. The school has also sent students to the World Universities Debating Championship held in Ireland, Turkey, Botswana, Manila, Berlin, and Chennai, breaking into elimination rounds in the 2011 World University Debating Championship. Debaters from the LDU have also regularly competed in tournaments hosted by Oxford University and Cambridge University, and in 2013 won the title of the Budapest IV and Vienna IV in consecutive tournaments. Domestically, the LDU has also won the title for Northeast Universities Debating Sweepstakes champion for four consecutive years. The program is currently ranked seventh in the top schools for British Parliamentary debate in the world, and is the third ranked American university on the list, behind only Yale and Cornell. It encourages participation of all interested UVM students, and sponsors public debates at UVM and for the Burlington community. The coach of the LDU, Dr. Alfred C. Snider, was, before his death in late 2015, one of the most decorated debate coaches in the world and also coached the National Speech and Debate Organization's national high school debate team to compete in the world championships. Concerts Ira Allen Chapel UVM Program Board (UPB) is responsible for bringing live musical entertainment to the UVM community. UPB features acts from across the country as well as local bands. UPB is composed of four committees, one of which is a concerts committee. The concerts committee learns about various aspects of the music industry by putting on shows and working with local sound and production professionals. Students are in charge of choosing and booking bands and are responsible for all production aspects on the day of show. UPB was founded in 2007 as it adopted the Concert Bureau was (established in 1971) as one of its committees. Concerts Bureau and UVM Program Board have brought in artists such as R.E.M., Phish (three of its four members attended UVM in the 1980s), Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sting, Lou Reed, Primus, The String Cheese Incident, James Brown, Bob Dylan, the Allman Brothers Band, Death Cab for Cutie, Jurassic 5, the Disco Biscuits, The Grateful Dead, Guster, and The Flaming Lips. Since 2001, the UVM Concert Bureau (which later transitioned into UVM Program Board), have organized an annual festival held in April known as SpringFest. SpringFest headliners have included Vida Blue, The Roots, Cake, Keller Williams, Gov't Mule, co-headliners Robert Randolph & the Family Band, Ziggy Marley, and Talib Kweli. Other acts to perform at various SpringFests have included The Meditations, Toots & the Maytals, Soulive, Rjd2, Apollo Sunshine, Ratatat in 2009, MSTRKRFT in 2010, The Roots and Thievery Corporation in 2011, Dillon Francis in 2012, MGMT in 2013, Atmosphere in 2014, The Disco Biscuits in 2015, The Head and the Heart in 2016, Two Door Cinema Club in 2017, and Playboi Carti in 2018.

This designation contrasts with the broader term multimedia, which may include non-interactive linear presentations as well as hypermedia. It is also related to the field of electronic literature. The term was first used in a 1965 article written by Ted Nelson.http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=806036 Complex information processing: a file structure for the complex, the changing and the indeterminate The World Wide Web is a classic example of hypermedia, whereas a non-interactive cinema presentation is an example of standard multimedia due to the absence of hyperlinks. The first hypermedia work was, arguably, the Aspen Movie Map. Bill Atkinson's HyperCard popularized hypermedia writing, while a variety of literary hypertext and hypertext works, fiction and non-fiction, demonstrated the promise of links. Most modern hypermedia is delivered via electronic pages from a variety of systems including media players, web browsers, and stand-alone applications (i.e., software that does not require network access). Audio hypermedia is emerging with voice command devices and voice browsing. Development tools Hypermedia may be developed in a number of ways. Any programming tool can be used to write programs that link data from internal variables and nodes for external data files. Multimedia development software such as Adobe Flash, Adobe Director, Macromedia Authorware, and MatchWare Mediator may be used to create stand-alone hypermedia applications, with emphasis on entertainment content. Some database software, such as Visual FoxPro and FileMaker Developer, may be used to develop stand-alone hypermedia applications, with emphasis on educational and business content management. Hypermedia applications may be developed on embedded devices for the mobile and the digital signage industries using the Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) specification from W3C (World Wide Web Consortium). Software applications, such as Ikivo Animator and Inkscape, simplify the development of hypermedia content based on SVG. Embedded devices, such as the iPhone, natively support SVG specifications and may be used to create mobile and distributed hypermedia applications. Hyperlinks may also be added to data files using most business software via the limited scripting and hyperlinking features built in. Documentation software, such as the Microsoft Office Suite and LibreOffice, allow for hypertext links to other content within the same file, other external files, and URL links to files on external file servers. For more emphasis on graphics and page layout, hyperlinks may be added using most modern desktop publishing tools. This includes presentation programs, such as Microsoft PowerPoint and LibreOffice Impress, add-ons to print layout programs such as Quark Immedia, and tools to include hyperlinks in PDF documents such as Adobe InDesign for creating and Adobe Acrobat for editing. Hyper Publish is a tool specifically designed and optimized for hypermedia and hypertext management. Any HTML editor may be used to build HTML files, accessible by any web browser. CD/DVD authoring tools, such as DVD Studio Pro, may be used to hyperlink the content of DVDs for DVD players or web links when the disc is played on a personal computer connected to the internet. Learning There have been a number of theories concerning hypermedia and learning. One important claim in the literature on hypermedia and learning is that it offers more control over the instructional environment for the reader or student. Another claim is that it levels the playing field among students of varying abilities and enhances collaborative learning. A claim from psychology includes the notion that hypermedia more closely models the structure of the brain, in comparison with printed text.Terry K. Borsook, Nancy Higginbotham- Wheat. A Psychology of Hypermedia: A Conceptual Framework for R&D.; 1992\\\\. Retrieved August 3, 2010. Application programming interfaces Hypermedia is used as a medium and constraint in certain application programming interfaces. HATEOAS, Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State, is a constraint of the REST application architecture where a client interacts with the server entirely through hypermedia provided dynamically by application servers. This means that in theory no API documentation is needed, because the client needs no prior knowledge about how to interact with any particular application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia. In other service-oriented architectures (SOA), clients and servers interact through a fixed interface shared through documentation or an interface description language (IDL).

In particular, a one element set \\\\\\\\{\\\\alpha\\\\\\\\} is algebraically independent over K if and only if \\\\alpha is transcendental over K. In general, all the elements of an algebraically independent set S over K are by necessity transcendental over K, and over all of the field extensions over K generated by the remaining elements of S. Example The two real numbers \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} and 2\\\\pi+1 are each transcendental numbers: they are not the roots of any nontrivial polynomial whose coefficients are rational numbers. Thus, each of the two singleton sets \\\\\\\\{\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{2\\\\pi+1\\\\\\\\} are algebraically independent over the field \\\\mathbb{Q} of rational numbers. However, the set \\\\\\\\{ \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi}, 2\\\\pi+1 \\\\\\\\} is not algebraically independent over the rational numbers, because the nontrivial polynomial :P(x,y)=2x^2-y+1 is zero when x=\\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} and y=2\\\\pi+1. Algebraic independence of known constants Although both \\\\pi and e are known to be transcendental, it is not known whether the set of both of them is algebraically independent over \\\\mathbb{Q}. In fact, it is not even known if \\\\pi+e is irrational. Nesterenko proved in 1996 that: * the numbers \\\\pi, e^\\\\pi, and Œì(1/4) are algebraically independent over \\\\mathbb{Q}. * the numbers \\\\pi, e^{\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{3}}, and Œì(1/3) are algebraically independent over \\\\mathbb{Q}. * for all positive integers n, the numbers \\\\pi and e^{\\\\pi\\\\sqrt{n}} are algebraically independent over \\\\mathbb{Q}. Lindemann‚ÄìWeierstrass theorem The Lindemann‚ÄìWeierstrass theorem can often be used to prove that some sets are algebraically independent over \\\\mathbb{Q}. It states that whenever \\\\alpha_1,\\\\ldots,\\\\alpha_n are algebraic numbers that are linearly independent over \\\\mathbb{Q}, then e^{\\\\alpha_1},\\\\ldots,e^{\\\\alpha_n} are also algebraically independent over \\\\mathbb{Q}. Algebraic matroids Given a field extension L/K which is not algebraic, Zorn's lemma can be used to show that there always exists a maximal algebraically independent subset of L over K. Further, all the maximal algebraically independent subsets have the same cardinality, known as the transcendence degree of the extension. For every set S of elements of L, the algebraically independent subsets of S satisfy the axioms that define the independent sets of a matroid. In this matroid, the rank of a set of elements is its transcendence degree, and the flat generated by a set T of elements is the intersection of L with the field K[T]. A matroid that can be generated in this way is called an algebraic matroid. No good characterization of algebraic matroids is known, but certain matroids are known to be non- algebraic; the smallest is the V√°mos matroid.. Many finite matroids may be represented by a matrix over a field K, in which the matroid elements correspond to matrix columns, and a set of elements is independent if the corresponding set of columns is linearly independent. Every matroid with a linear representation of this type may also be represented as an algebraic matroid, by choosing an indeterminate for each row of the matrix, and by using the matrix coefficients within each column to assign each matroid element a linear combination of these transcendentals. The converse is false: not every algebraic matroid has a linear representation..

GRUB is the reference implementation of the Free Software Foundation's Multiboot Specification, which provides a user the choice to boot one of multiple operating systems installed on a computer or select a specific kernel configuration available on a particular operating system's partitions. GNU GRUB was developed from a package called the Grand Unified Bootloader (a play on Grand Unified TheoryEnterpriseLinux.com Definitions Definition of GRand Unified Bootloader). It is predominantly used for Unix-like systems. The GNU operating system uses GNU GRUB as its boot loader, as do most Linux distributions and the Solaris operating system on x86 systems, starting with the Solaris 10 1/06 release. GRUB is often used as a OS picker on startup for dual-boot computers, for instance, where one system is Linux and the other Windows. Operation MBR- partitioned hard drive; stage 1 (\`boot.img\`) can alternatively be written into one of the partition boot sectors. GPT-partitioned hard drive, booting on BIOS firmware, or UEFI compatibility mode (CSM) =Booting= When a computer is turned on, BIOS finds the configured primary bootable device (usually the computer's hard disk) and loads and executes the initial bootstrap program from the master boot record (MBR). The MBR is the first sector of the hard disk, with zero as its offset (sectors counting starts at zero). For a long time, the size of a sector has been 512 bytes, but since 2009 there are hard disks available with a sector size of 4096 bytes, called Advanced Format disks. , such hard disks are still accessed in 512-byte sectors, by utilizing the 512e emulation. The legacy MBR partition table supports a maximum of four partitions and occupies 64 bytes, combined. Together with the optional disk signature (four bytes) and disk timestamp (six bytes), this leaves between 434 and 446 bytes available for the machine code of a boot loader. Although such a small space can be sufficient for very simple boot loaders, it is not big enough to contain a boot loader supporting complex and multiple file systems, menu-driven selection of boot choices, etc. Boot loaders with bigger footprints are thus split into pieces, where the smallest piece fits into and resides within the MBR, while larger piece(s) are stored in other locations (for example, into empty sectors between the MBR and the first partition) and invoked by the boot loader's MBR code. Operating system kernel images are in most cases files residing on appropriate file systems, but the concept of a file system is unknown to the BIOS. Thus, in BIOS-based systems, the duty of a boot loader is to access the content of those files, so it can be loaded into the RAM and executed. One possible approach for boot loaders to load kernel images is by directly accessing hard disk sectors without understanding the underlying file system. Usually, an additional level of indirection is required, in form of maps or map files auxiliary files that contain a list of physical sectors occupied by kernel images. Such maps need to be updated each time a kernel image changes its physical location on disk, due to installing new kernel images, file system defragmentation etc. Also, in case of the maps changing their physical location, their locations need to be updated within the boot loader's MBR code, so the sectors indirection mechanism continues to work. This is not only cumbersome, but it also leaves the system in need of manual repairs in case something goes wrong during system updates. Another approach is to make a boot loader aware of the underlying file systems, so kernel images are configured and accessed using their actual file paths. That requires a boot loader to contain a driver for each of the supported file systems, so they can be understood and accessed by the boot loader itself. This approach eliminates the need for hardcoded locations of hard disk sectors and existence of map files, and does not require MBR updates after the kernel images are added or moved around. Configuration of a boot loader is stored in a regular file, which is also accessed in a file system-aware way to obtain boot configurations before the actual booting of any kernel images. As a result, the possibility for things to go wrong during various system updates is significantly reduced. As a downside, such boot loaders have increased internal complexity and even bigger footprints. GNU GRUB uses the second approach, by understanding the underlying file systems. The boot loader itself is split into multiple stages, allowing for itself to fit within the MBR boot scheme. Two major versions of GRUB are in common use: GRUB version 1, called GRUB legacy, is only prevalent in older releases of Linux distributions, some of which are still in use and supported, for example CentOS 5. GRUB 2 was written from scratch and intended to replace its predecessor, and is now used by a majority of Linux distributions. =Version 0 (GRUB Legacy)= Ubuntu 8.04 installation) GRUB 0.x follows a two-stage approach. The master boot record (MBR) usually contains GRUB stage 1, or can contain a standard MBR implementation which chainloads GRUB stage 1 from the active partition's boot sector. Given the small size of a boot sector (512 bytes), stage 1 can do little more than load the next stage of GRUB by loading a few disk sectors from a fixed location near the start of the disk (within its first 1024 cylinders). Stage 1 can load stage 2 directly, but it is normally set up to load the stage 1.5., located in the first 30 KiB of hard disk immediately following the MBR and before the first partition. In case this space is not available (unusual partition table, special disk drivers, GPT or LVM disk) the install of stage 1.5 will fail. The stage 1.5 image contains file system drivers, enabling it to directly load stage 2 from any known location in the filesystem, for example from \`/boot/grub\`. Stage 2 will then load the default configuration file and any other modules needed. =Version 2 (GRUB 2)= GRUB 2 ‚Äì MBR vs. GPT partitioning and boot sequence visualized (systems using BIOS firmware).  Startup on systems using BIOS firmware  * See illustration in last image on the right. * 1st stage:\`boot.img\` is written to the first 440 bytes of the Master Boot Record (MBR in sector 0), or optionally in a partition's boot sector (PBR / VBR). It addresses \`diskboot.img\` by a 64-bit LBA address, thus it can load from above the 2 GiB limit of the MBR. The actual sector number is written by \`grub-install\`. * 2nd stage: \`diskboot.img\` is the first sector of \`core.img\` (called stage 1.5 in GRUB Legacy) with the sole purpose to load the rest of \`core.img\` identified by LBA sector numbers also written by \`grub-install\`. * On MBR partitioned disks: \`core.img\` is stored in the empty sectors (if available) between the MBR and the first partition. Recent operating systems suggest a 1 MiB gap here for alignment (2047*512 byte or 255*4KiB sectors). This gap used to be 62 sectors (31 KiB) as a reminder of the sector number limit of C/H/S addressing used by Bios before 1998, therefore \`core.img\` is designed to be smaller than 32 KiB. * On GPT partitioned disks: partitions are not limited to 4, thus \`core.img\` is written to its own tiny (1 MiB), filesystem-less BIOS boot partition. * 3rd stage: \`core.img\` enters 32-bit protected mode, uncompresses itself (the kernel of grub and filesystem modules to reach /boot/grub), then loads \`/boot/grub//normal.mod\` from the partition configured by \`grub-install\`. If the partition index has changed, GRUB will be unable to find the \`normal.mod\`, and presents the user with the GRUB Rescue prompt, where the user ‚Äúcan‚Äù find and load \`normal.mod\`, or the linux kernel. * The \`/boot/grub\` directory can be located on any partition (GRUB can read many filesystems, including NTFS). Depending on how it was installed it's either in the root partition of the distribution, or a separate /boot partition. * 4th stage: \`normal.mod\` (equivalent of stage 2 in GRUB Legacy) parses \`/boot/grub/grub.cfg\`, optionally loads modules (eg. for graphical UI) and shows the menu.  Startup on systems using UEFI firmware  * Common on motherboards since ca. 2012. * \`/efi//grubx64.efi\` is installed as a file in the EFI System Partition, and booted by the firmware directly, without a \`boot.img\` in sector 0. * \`/boot/grub/\` can be installed on the EFI System Partition as well.  After startup  GRUB presents a menu where the user can choose from operating systems (OS) found by grub-install. GRUB can be configured to automatically load a specified OS after a user-defined timeout. If the timeout is set to zero seconds, pressing and holding while the computer is booting makes it possible to access the boot menu. In the operating system selection menu GRUB accepts a couple of commands: * By pressing , it is possible to edit kernel parameters of the selected menu item before the operating system is started. The reason for doing this in GRUB (i.e. not editing the parameters in an already booted system) can be an emergency case: the system has failed to boot. Using the kernel parameters line it is possible, among other things, to specify a module to be disabled (blacklisted) for the kernel. This could be required if the specific kernel module is broken and thus prevents boot-up. For example, to blacklist the kernel module \`nvidia-current\`, one could append \`modprobe.blacklist=nvidia-current\` at the end of the kernel parameters. * By pressing , the user enters the GRUB command line. The GRUB command line is not a regular Linux shell, like e.g. bash, and accepts only certain GRUB-specific commands, documented by various Linux distributions. Once boot options have been selected, GRUB loads the selected kernel into memory and passes control to the kernel. Alternatively, GRUB can pass control of the boot process to another boot loader, using chain loading. This is the method used to load operating systems that do not support the Multiboot Specification or are not supported directly by GRUB.

The GNU GRUB developers have switched their focus to GRUB 2,. a complete rewrite with goals including making GNU GRUB cleaner, more robust, more portable and more powerful. GRUB 2 started under the name PUPA. PUPA was supported by the Information-technology Promotion Agency (IPA) in Japan. PUPA was integrated into GRUB 2 development around 2002, when GRUB version 0.9x was renamed GRUB Legacy. Some of the goals of the GRUB 2 project include support for non-x86 platforms, internationalization and localization, non-ASCII characters, dynamic modules, memory management, a scripting mini-language, migrating platform specific (x86) code to platform specific modules, and an object-oriented framework. GNU GRUB version 2.00 was officially released on June 26, 2012. Three of the most widely used Linux distributions use GRUB 2 as their mainstream boot loader.

Boot-Repair can repair GRUB on multiple Linux distributions including, but not limited to, Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, Fedora, openSUSE, and Arch Linux.GRUB Customizer =Installer for Windows= Grub2Win is a Windows open-source software package. It allows GNU GRUB to boot from a Windows directory. The setup program installs GNU GRUB version 2.04 to an NTFS partition. A Windows GUI application is then used to customize the GRUB boot menu, themes, UEFI boot order, scripts etc. All GNU GRUB scripts and commands are supported for both UEFI and legacy systems. Grub2Win can configure GRUB for multiboot of Windows, Ubuntu, openSuse, Fedora and many other Linux distributions. It is freely available under GNU GPL License at SourceForge. Alternative boot-managers The strength of GRUB is the wide range of supported platforms, file-systems, and operating systems, making it the default choice for distributions and embedded systems. However, there are boot-managers targeted at the end user that gives more friendly user experience, graphical OS selector and simpler configuration: * rEFInd ‚Äì Macintosh-style graphical boot-manager, only for UEFI-based computers (BIOS not supported). * CloverEFI ‚Äì Macintosh-style graphical boot-manager for BIOS and UEFI-based computers. Emulates UEFI with a heavily modified DUET from the TianoCore project. Requires a FAT formatted partition even on BIOS systems. As a benefit, it has a basic filesystem driver in the partition boot sector, avoiding the brittleness of GRUB 2nd, 3rd stage and the infamous GRUB Rescue prompt. The user interface looks similar to rEFInd: both inherit from the abandoned boot-manager rEFIt. * BOOTBOOT ‚Äì a simple and easy-to-use, 64 bit only boot protocol. Supports BIOS, UEFI, ARM Raspberry Pi (3 and up), El Torito CDROM, the Linux x86 boot protocol, UEFI PCI Option ROMs etc. It is also Multiboot compatible, so it can be added to a grub.cfg's menuentry. Graphical screen and serial port (for debug messages) are set up for the kernel regardless to the platform. For kernels ELF64 and PE32+ supported with higher-half linkage, and C/C++ and Rust examples provided for hobby OS developers. Non-graphical alternatives: * systemd-boot ‚Äì Light, UEFI-only boot-manager with text-based OS selector menu.

The intervention lasted for around three months until President Camille Chamoun, who had requested the assistance, completed his term as president of Lebanon. American and Lebanese government forces successfully occupied the Port of Beirut and Beirut International Airport. With the crisis over, the United States withdrew. Background In July 1958, Lebanon was threatened by a civil war between Maronite Christians and Muslims. Tensions with Egypt had escalated earlier in 1956 when pro-Western Christian President Camille Chamoun did not break diplomatic relations with the Western powers that attacked Egypt during the Suez Crisis, angering Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser. The tensions were further increased when Chamoun showed closeness to the Baghdad Pact. Nasser felt that the pro-Western Baghdad Pact posed a threat to Arab nationalism. As a response, Egypt and Syria united into the United Arab Republic (UAR). Lebanese Sunni Prime Minister Rashid Karami supported Nasser in 1956 and 1958. Lebanese Muslims pushed the government to join the newly-created United Arab Republic, but the Christians wanted to keep Lebanon aligned with Western powers. A Muslim rebellion that was allegedly supplied with arms by the United Arab Republic through Syria caused Chamoun to complain to the United Nations Security Council. The United Nations sent a group of inspectors that found no evidence of significant intervention from the United Arab Republic. The toppling of a pro-Western government in Iraq's 14 July Revolution, along with the internal instability, caused Chamoun to call for American assistance. Operation Blue Bat U.S. Marines on patrol in Beirut US President Dwight D. Eisenhower responded by authorizing Operation Blue Bat on July 15, 1958 in the first application of the Eisenhower Doctrine in which the US announced that it would intervene to protect regimes that it considered to be threatened by international communism. The goal of the operation was to bolster Chamoun's pro-Western Lebanese government from internal opposition and threats from Syria and Egypt. The plan was to occupy and secure Beirut International Airport, a few miles south of the city, and then to secure the port of Beirut and the approaches to the city. The chain of command for Operation Blue Bat was as follows: the Eisenhower administration at the strategic level; Specified Command, Middle East (SPECCOMME, a 'double- hat' for Commander in Chief, U.S. Naval Forces, Eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean) at the operational level; the Sixth Fleet, with aircraft carriers , , and , cruisers and , and two destroyer squadrons, including the USS Leary DDR 879, USS Vesole DDR 878, and the USS Wood DD 750. At the end of June, Essex and Boston were anchored at Piraeus, Greece, while Des Moines, from which Vice Admiral Charles R. Brown was flying his flag, was at Villefranche-sur-Mer.Thomas A. Bryson, Tars, Turks, and Tankers: The Role of the United States Navy in the Middle East, Scarecrow Press, Inc.: Metuchen (NJ) and London, 1980, 128. Land forces included the 2nd Provisional Marine Force (Task Force 62) and the Army Task Force 201 at the tactical level.Scott Jackman, Political Success in War: A Criterion for Success, DTIC. Each of these three components influenced Operations Plan 215-58 and its execution. Eisenhower in a newsreel on Lebanon The operation involved more than 14,000 men, including 8,509 US Army personnel, a contingent from the 1st Airborne Battle Group, 187th Infantry from the 24th Infantry Division and 5,670 officers and men of the United States Marine Corps (the 2nd Provisional Marine Force, of Battalion Landing Teams 1/8 and 2/2 under Brigadier General Sidney S. Wade). The 2nd Battalion, 8th Marines arrived on July 16 after a 54-hour airlift from Cherry Point, North Carolina For more on the naval and Marine Corps forces involved, see Bryson, 1980, 126‚Äì140. They were supported by a fleet of 70 ships and 40,000 sailors. On July 16, 1958, Admiral James L. Holloway Jr., CINCNELM and CINCSPECCOMME, flew in from London to Beirut airport and boarded USS Taconic from which he commanded the remainder of the operation.Bryson, 1980, 131. The U.S. withdrew its forces on October 25, 1958. Eisenhower sent the diplomat Robert Daniel Murphy to Lebanon as his personal representative. Murphy played a significant role in convincing both sides of the conflict to reach a compromise by electing the moderate Christian general Fouad Chehab as incoming president but allowing Chamoun to continue in power until the end of his term, on September 22. Lebanese Prime Minister Rashid Karami formed a national reconciliation government after the end of the 1958 crisis.

Born in the East End of London to a large family of Jewish immigrants, he moved to Glasgow, Scotland, as a boy and left school at the age of eleven. He became a trade union organiser and one of the leading figures of Red Clydeside. He was imprisoned in 1919 for his alleged involvement in the disturbances in Glasgow in January of that year. Shinwell served as a Labour MP from 1922 to 1924, and from a by-election in 1928 until 1931, and held junior office in the minority Labour Governments of 1924 and 1929‚Äì31. He returned to the House of Commons in 1935, defeating former UK Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald, who by that time had been expelled from the Labour Party. During the Second World War, he was a leading backbencher critic of the Coalition Government. Shinwell is perhaps best remembered as the Minister of Fuel and Power in the Attlee ministry who nationalised coal mining in 1946. He was in charge of Britain's coal supply during the extremely harsh winter of January to March 1947, during which the supply system collapsed, leaving the United Kingdom to freeze and close down. He became unpopular with the public and was sacked in October 1947. He then served as Secretary of State for War, and then as Minister of Defence from 1950‚Äì51. The high defence spending which he demanded, partly to pay for British involvement in the Korean War, was a major factor causing then-Chancellor of the Exchequer Hugh Gaitskell to impose NHS charges, prompting the resignation of Aneurin Bevan from the Cabinet. After Labour's defeat in 1951, Shinwell continued to serve in the Shadow Cabinet in Opposition until he stepped down in 1955. Thereafter he was a senior backbencher until 1970, by which time he was in his mid-eighties. That year he accepted a life peerage and was an active member of the House of Lords until shortly before his death, aged 101, in 1986. Early life, career and trade union activities Shinwell was born in Spitalfields, London, but his family moved to Glasgow, Scotland. His father was a Polish Jew who had a small clothing shop, and his mother, a Dutch Jewess, was a cook from London. He was the eldest of thirteen children.Matthew 2004 pp364-5 He educated himself in a public library and at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery. He enjoyed sport, particularly boxing, and he was the trainer of a local football team. He left school at age eleven to be apprenticed as a tailor, and began his working life as a machinist in a clothing workshop. In 1903, he became active in the Amalgamated Union of Clothiers' Operatives, and joined the Glasgow Trades Council in 1906 as a delegate of that union. In May 1911, he was seconded to help organise the seamen of Glasgow at the request of Havelock Wilson of the National Sailors' and Firemen's Union (NSFU). He played a prominent role in the six-week Glasgow seamen's strike which began on 14 June and which was part of a nationwide strike. He subsequently became the secretary of the Glasgow branch of the NSFU. In August 1912, he participated in a revolt against the union, which resulted in the Glasgow branch becoming part of the Southampton- based British Seafarers' Union (BSU). He was the local secretary of the BSU until it became part of the Amalgamated Marine Workers' Union (AMWU) in 1922, after which he served as National Organiser of the new organisation. Shinwell (left) at an election meeting in 1918 In 1918, he stood unsuccessfully for Linlithgowshire (alternative name West LothianEdinburgh Gazette, Issue 14007, Page 417, 21 March 1924). In 1919, he gained national notoriety through his involvement in the Glasgow 40 Hours' Movement. This movement culminated in clashes between police and protesters in Glasgow's George Square in January 1919, in which he was alleged to have been involved. He was afterwards tried for incitement to riot and was sentenced to five months' imprisonment in Calton Jail, Edinburgh. Political career =Interwar and World War Two= Shinwell in 1920 An Independent Labour Party (ILP) member, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Linlithgowshire at the 1922 general election. In 1924 he was Secretary for Mines (not a Cabinet-level post)ODNB has him as Parliamentary Under-Secretary, which appears to be an error in the First Labour Government. He lost his seat in 1924, but was re-elected for Linlithgowshire at a by-election in 1928. In the second Labour Government of 1929‚Äì31 Ramsay MacDonald appointed him Financial Secretary to the War Office (1929‚Äì30); Cowling says that MacDonald believed he had rescued Shinwell's ministerial career when no minister would take him. He then served again as Secretary for Mines from 1930‚Äì1. At the time Shinwell was an admirer of MacDonald and tried to dissuade him from forming a National Government in 1931. He again lost his seat at the general election that year. He returned to the Commons in 1935 after defeating MacDonald for Seaham Harbour, County Durham (later renamed Easington after boundary changes in the late 1940s). He campaigned vigorously, along with left-wingers such as Aneurin Bevan, for Britain to support the Popular Front government in Spain against Franco in the Spanish Civil War. On 4 April 1938, during a heated House of Commons debate in which he had been criticising the government's foreign policy, he struck Conservative MP Commander Robert Tatton Bower in the face- causing internal bleeding and a burst eardrum- after Bower told him to \\"go back to Poland!\\". Shinwell said he had taken this to be an anti-semitic remark. In May 1940 he refused a position in Winston Churchill's Coalition Government in the Ministry of Food. He became chairman of the Labour Party in 1942. During the Second World War he was a vigorous but patriotic backbench critic of Churchill. He and Earl Winterton, another serial critic of the government, were known as \\"Arsenic and Old Lace\\".Matthew 2004 pp364-5 Winterton was an Irish peer and thus eligible to sit in the Commons =Attlee Governments: 1945‚Äì51= Minister of Fuel and Power He served in Clement Attlee's Cabinet after the Labour victory in 1945 as Minister of Fuel and Power, and in 1946 he presided over the nationalisation of the mining industry. He also negotiated a miners' charter with the NUM. He declared the middle class \\"not worth a tinker's cuss\\". His insistence on the open-cast mining of the park of the Wentworth Woodhouse estate, to the doorsteps of the house, when the quality of the coal was poor, was viewed by its owners and the local mining community, which opposed it, as pure vindictiveness ‚Äì an act of class warfare. In 1947-8 he was Chairman of the Labour Party. In 1947, Britain experienced, in an exceptionally severe winter, a serious coal shortage. The supply system collapsed, leaving Britain to freeze and close down. Shinwell denied there were problems and refused to assume responsibility, blaming the climate, the railway system, or capitalism generally.Kenneth O. Morgan, The people's peace: British history, 1945‚Äì1990 (1992) pp 68‚Äì69. Shinwell was widely criticised for his failure to avert this crisis. His earlier comment that \\"There will be no fuel crisis. I am Minister of Fuel and Power and I ought to know\\", was later included in the official handbook for Conservative Party members to use in speeches and leaflets.Rees-Mogg 2011, p 77 In 1947 Shinwell presided over the nationalisation of electricity. In October 1947 he was sacked. He was bitterly resentful at being replaced by Hugh Gaitskell, his former deputy and a public schoolboy. He was also attacked by James Callaghan (then a junior minister) for his lack of zeal about further nationalisation. Secretary of State for War Shinwell was demoted to Secretary of State for War (Minister for the Army, but no longer a full member of the Cabinet) a position which he held until 1950. He was a vigorous War Minister, who got on well with the Army and was seen as jingoistic. In November 1947 a report from MI5 alleged that Shinwell had passed secret information to a man named \\"Stanley\\", who had passed it on to Zionist paramilitary group, the Irgun. Shinwell knew self- styled \\"contact man\\" Sidney Stanley, whom he had approached for help in finding employment for his son Ernie, and Stanley had obtained information on the disbandment of the Transjordan Frontier Force from some government source. Minister of Defence Shinwell's seat became Easington at the February 1950 election, after which he was promoted to Minister of Defence and became a full member of the Cabinet once more. Edmund Dell described him as \\"putty in the hands of the defence chiefs\\" and his promotion as \\"[a] ludicrous appointment. No failure was ever great enough to persuade Attlee to deny one of his cohorts new opportunities to do damage ‚Ä¶ Shinwell never forgave Gaitskell, whom he blamed for his disgrace.\\" Gaitskell, promoted to Chancellor of the Exchequer later in the year, recorded in his diary that Shinwell \\"never loses an opportunity of picking a quarrel with me, sometimes on the most ridiculous grounds\\".Dell 1997, pp. 145, 153 His term of office saw the Malayan Emergency and the early stages of Korean War, which began in June 1950 and to which British troops were deployed. Shinwell was responsible for the rearmament programme which precipitated the resignation of Aneurin Bevan from the Cabinet in the spring of 1951, although Gaitskell actually gave him less defence spending than he wanted. In the summer of 1951 the Cabinet blocked him from sending British troops to Abadan when the oil refineries were nationalised by the Iranian government. Shinwell was by now seen as being on the right of the Labour Party. At the Labour Party Conference at Scarborough that autumn, he lost his place as an elected constituency representative on the Labour Party National Executive Committee (NEC), the members of which were increasingly elected by Bevanites in the constituency parties. Labour lost the general election a month later.The ODNB erroneously states that he lost his NEC seat at the infamous Morecambe Conference in 1952, the year in which Dalton and Herbert Morrison were voted offCampbell 1987, p. 256 =Later political career= Shinwell stepped down from the Shadow Cabinet (which at that time was elected by Labour MPs when the party was in opposition) in 1955. That year he published a volume of memoirs, Conflict Without Malice. By the early 1960s he had changed his mind about nuclear weapons and opposed the deployment of US nuclear submarines to Holy Loch. Shinwell did not resume ministerial office when Labour returned to power in October 1964, but instead the new Prime Minister Harold Wilson appointed him Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, and during the 1964-6 Parliament he worked hard to drum up backbench support for the government, which had a very narrow majority. He was appointed to the Order of the Companions of Honour in the 1965 Birthday Honours. He was vehemently opposed to Wilson's attempt to enter the EEC in 1966, and resigned as Chairman of the Labour Party in 1967. He got on well both with Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery and with the journalist Sir John Junor. Shinwell was created a life peer as Baron Shinwell, of Easington in the County of Durham, on 29 June 1970. He later became chair of the All- Party Lords Defence Study Group. In 1973 he published another volume of memoirs, I've Lived through It All. He voted against the Labour Government in 1976. He resigned the Labour Party whip in 1982 in protest at left wing militancy. Death In October 1984 Shinwell celebrated his hundredth birthday against the backdrop of the miners' strike. He continued to be active in the House of Lords until shortly before his death. He became the longest- lived peer on 26 March 1986, dying a little over a month later on 8 May, aged 101. He held the record for the second longest-lived British MP (after Theodore Cooke Taylor) until overtaken by Bert Hazell in November 2008. Shinwell's estate was valued for probate at ¬£271,509 (around ¬£700,000 at 2016 prices). Personal life Shinwell was married three times: from 1903 to 1954 to Fay (Fanny) Freeman, by whom he had two sons and a daughter, from 1956 to 1971 to Dinah Meyer, who was Danish, and from 1972 to 1977 to Sarah Sturgo. He outlived all three of his wives.

Complex plane Mathematicians sometimes identify the Cartesian plane with the complex plane, and then the upper half-plane corresponds to the set of complex numbers with positive imaginary part: :\\\\mathbb{H} = \\\\\\\\{x + iy \\\\mid y > 0; x, y \\\\in \\\\mathbb{R} \\\\\\\\}. The term arises from a common visualization of the complex number as the point in the plane endowed with Cartesian coordinates. When the Y-axis is oriented vertically, the \\"upper half-plane\\" corresponds to the region above the X-axis and thus complex numbers for which y > 0\\\\. It is the domain of many functions of interest in complex analysis, especially modular forms. The lower half-plane, defined by y < 0, is equally good, but less used by convention. The open unit disk D (the set of all complex numbers of absolute value less than one) is equivalent by a conformal mapping to H (see \\"Poincar√© metric\\"), meaning that it is usually possible to pass between H and D. It also plays an important role in hyperbolic geometry, where the Poincar√© half-plane model provides a way of examining hyperbolic motions. The Poincar√© metric provides a hyperbolic metric on the space. The uniformization theorem for surfaces states that the upper half-plane is the universal covering space of surfaces with constant negative Gaussian curvature. The closed upper half-plane is the union of the upper half-plane and the real axis. It is the closure of the upper half-plane. Affine geometry The affine transformations of the upper half-plane include (1) shifts (x,y) ‚Üí (x + c, y), c ‚àà ‚Ñù, and (2) dilations (x,y) ‚Üí (Œª x, Œª y), Œª > 0. Proposition: Let A and B be semicircles in the upper half-plane with centers on the boundary. Then there is an affine mapping that takes A to B. :Proof: First shift the center of A to (0,0). Then take Œª = (diameter of B)/(diameter of A) and dilate. Then shift (0,0) to the center of B. Definition: Z = \\\\\\\\{ (\\\\cos^2 \\\\theta , \\\\tfrac{1}{2} \\\\sin 2 \\\\theta) : 0 < \\\\theta < \\\\pi \\\\\\\\} . Z can be recognized as the circle of radius 1/2 centered at (1/2, 0), and as the polar plot of \\\\rho (\\\\theta) = \\\\cos \\\\theta . Proposition: (0,0), œÅ(Œ∏) in Z, and (1, tan Œ∏) are collinear points. In fact, Z is the reflection of the line (1,y), y > 0, in the unit circle. Indeed, the diagonal from (0,0) to (1, tan Œ∏) has squared length 1 + \\\\tan^2 \\\\theta = \\\\sec^2 \\\\theta, so that \\\\rho (\\\\theta) = \\\\cos \\\\theta is the reciprocal of that length. =Metric geometry= The distance between any two points p and q in the upper half- plane can be consistently defined as follows: The perpendicular bisector of the segment from p to q either intersects the boundary or is parallel to it. In the latter case p and q lie on a ray perpendicular to the boundary and logarithmic measure can be used to define a distance that is invariant under dilation. In the former case p and q lie on a circle centered at the intersection of their perpendicular bisector and the boundary. By the above proposition this circle can be moved by affine motion to Z. Distances on Z can be defined using the correspondence with points on (1,y), y > 0, and logarithmic measure on this ray. In consequence, the upper half-plane becomes a metric space. The generic name of this metric space is the hyperbolic plane. In terms of the models of hyperbolic geometry, this model is frequently designated the Poincar√© half-plane model. Generalizations One natural generalization in differential geometry is hyperbolic n-space Hn, the maximally symmetric, simply connected, n-dimensional Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature ‚àí1. In this terminology, the upper half-plane is H2 since it has real dimension 2. In number theory, the theory of Hilbert modular forms is concerned with the study of certain functions on the direct product Hn of n copies of the upper half-plane. Yet another space interesting to number theorists is the Siegel upper half-space Hn, which is the domain of Siegel modular forms.

Maclean was the first Secretary of the Socialist Labour Party, but was expelled in 1908. Then a member of the Independent Labour Party (ILP), Maclean worked closely with other socialists in the Glasgow area, as part of the Red Clydeside movement. Like many other Red Clydesiders, he was a conscientious objector in the First World War. He greatly influenced Manny Shinwell. An organiser for the Scottish Co-operative Wholesale Society, in the 1918 General Election Maclean was elected to the House of Commons to represent the Govan seat in Glasgow.

He was a prominent figure of the Red Clydeside era. Early life and career Wheatley was born to Thomas and Johanna Wheatley in Bonmahon, County Waterford, Ireland. In 1876 the family moved to Braehead, Lanarkshire in Scotland. Initially -- as his father had done in Ireland -- he worked as a miner in the Baillieston district. After that he worked briefly as a publican. Wheatley then started a successful printing business, which published leftist political works. He wrote many of them, including How the Miners Were Robbed (1907),http://economicdemocracy.org/miners.html John Wheatley, 1907 The Catholic Workingman (1909), Miners, Mines and Misery (1909), Eight Pound Cottages for Glasgow Citizens (1913), Municipal Banking (1920) and The New Rent Act (1920). He was a deeply religious man and a practising Roman Catholic. Influenced by early Christian-socialist thinkers, in 1907 he joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP). He founded and was the first chairman of the Catholic Socialist Society. Against the UK's involvement in World War I, he campaigned against conscription and assisted in organising rent strikes in Glasgow. As a councillor on Glasgow's city council, he became one of the best known in the city, and was elected to the House of Commons in the 1922 General Election for Glasgow Shettleston. He was a great supporter of Celtic Football Club. Labour leader Ramsay MacDonald sometimes disapproved of Wheatley's debating methods, as well as his friendship with James Maxton. ( Maxton was suspended from the Commons on one occasion when he called Conservative MP Sir Frederick Banbury \\"a murderer\\" for a proposed cut in child welfare.) But Wheatley continued to work closely with his ILP colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party, especially Maxton. Wheatley was known as the intellectual behind the ILP activities. Along with many ILP MPs, especially those from Clydeside, he found himself drifting from MacDonald's Labour leadership. Wheatley remained a widely respected political figure and when MacDonald became Prime Minister in January 1924, he appointed Wheatley as his Minister of Health. Wheatley is best remembered for his Housing (Financial Provisions) Act 1924, which saw a massive expansion in affordable municipal housing for the working class. On 9 May 1924, H. G. Wells led a delegation to ask for birth control reforms. The delegation asked for two things: that institutions under Ministry of Health control should give contraceptive advice to those who asked for it; and that doctors at welfare centres should be allowed to offer advice in certain medical cases. Wheatley held strong views against birth control and refused to support the campaign. Wheatley criticised MacDonald for moving Labour to the right. Consequently he found himself unappointed to the Labour Government which formed after the 1929 United Kingdom general election. He refused to support many of the measures proposed by MacDonald's government. Along with Maxton (now Wheatley's leader in the ILP) he became one of the Labour-left's leading critics. Death and legacy John Wheatley died on 12 May 1930, one week before his 61st birthday. Wheatley Housing Group (Scotland's largest registered social landlord) and John Wheatley College (now Glasgow Kelvin College) in Glasgow are named after him. His nephew, John Thomas Wheatley, became a Labour MP for Edinburgh in 1947 and Lord Advocate.

NTLDR is typically run from the primary hard disk drive, but it can also run from portable storage devices such as a CD-ROM, USB flash drive, or floppy disk. NTLDR can also load a non NT-based operating system given the appropriate boot sector in a file. NTLDR requires, at the minimum, the following two files to be on the system volume: * , the main boot loader itself * , required for booting an NT-based OS, detects basic hardware information needed for successful boot An additional important file is boot.ini, which contains boot configuration (if missing, NTLDR will default to \\\\Windows on the first partition of the first hard drive). NTLDR is launched by the volume boot record of system partition, which is typically written to the disk by the Windows or command. History Windows NT was originally designed for ARC-compatible platforms, relying on its boot manager support and providing only osloader.exe, a loading program accepting ordinary command-line arguments specifying Windows directory partition, location or boot parameters, which is launched by ARC-compatible boot manager when a user chooses to start specific Windows NT operating system. However, because the x86 lacked any of the ARC support, the additional layer was added specifically for that platform: custom boot manager code presenting text menu allowing the user to choose from one or more operating system and its options configured in boot.ini configuration file, prepended by special StartUp module which is responsible for some preparations such as switching the CPU to the protected mode. When a user chooses an operating system from the boot menu, the following command-line arguments are then passed to the part of the osloader.exe common to all processor architectures: In Windows releases starting from Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, NTLDR has been split off back to its boot manager and system loader parts: the Windows Boot Manager and winload.exe. The boot manager part has been completely rewritten; it no longer uses boot.ini as a configuration file, although the bootcfg utility for modifying boot.ini is still present for the case of multi-boot configurations with Windows versions up to Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. Command-line interface The bootsect.exe utility program in the Windows PE tools has options /nt52 (NTLDR) and /nt60 (Vista and up) to store a NTLDR or Vista boot record in the first sector of a specified partition. The command can be used for FAT and NTFS based file systems. It replaces the FixFAT and FixNTFS tools.MS-DOS and Windows command line bootsect command =Example= The following example applies the NTLDR compatible master boot code to the D: volume:MS-DOS and Windows command line bootsect command C:\\\\>bootsect /nt52 D: Startup process When a PC is powered on its BIOS follows the configured boot order to find a bootable device. This can be a harddisk, floppy, CD/DVD, network connection, USB-device, etc. depending on the BIOS. In the case of a floppy the BIOS interprets its boot sector (first sector) as code, for NTLDR this could be a NTLDR boot sector looking for the \`ntldr\` file on the floppy. For a harddisk the code in the Master Boot Record (first sector) determines the active partition. The code in the boot sector of the active partition could then be again a NTLDR boot sector looking for \`ntldr\` in the root directory of this active partition. In a more convoluted scenario the active partition can contain a Vista boot sector for the newer Vista boot manager with an {ntldr} entry pointing to another partition with a NTLDR boot sector. When booting, the loader portion of NTLDR does the following in order: #Accesses the file system on the boot drive (either FAT or New Technology File System, NTFS). #If Windows was put in the hibernation state, the contents of hiberfil.sys are loaded into memory and the system resumes where it left off. #Otherwise, reads boot.ini and prompts the user with the boot menu accordingly. #If a non NT-based OS is selected, NTLDR loads the associated file listed in boot.ini (bootsect.dos if no file is specified or if the user is booting into a DOS based OS) and gives it control. #If an NT-based OS is selected, NTLDR runs ntdetect.com, which gathers information about the computer's hardware. (If ntdetect.com hangs during hardware detection, there is a debug version called ntdetect.chk that can be found on Microsoft support.Windows 2000 Server) #Starts Ntoskrnl.exe, passing to it the information returned by ntdetect.com.  boot.ini  NTLDR's first action is to read the Boot.ini file.Rick Maybury, Startup and Shutdown Problems, part 1 , Bootcamp, 2009, accessed 25 April 2012 NTLDR allows the user to choose which operating system to boot from at the menu. For NT and NT-based operating systems, it also allows the user to pass preconfigured options to the kernel. The menu options are stored in boot.ini, which itself is located in the root of the same disk as NTLDR. Though NTLDR can boot DOS and non-NT versions of Windows, boot.ini cannot configure their boot options. For NT-based OSs, the location of the operating system is written as an Advanced RISC Computing (ARC) path. boot.ini is protected from user configuration by having the following file attributes: system, hidden, read-only. To manually edit it, the user would first have to remove these attributes. A more secure fashion to edit the file is to use the bootcfg command from a console. bootcfg will also relock the file (setting the file back to system, hidden, and read-only). Additionally, the file can be edited within Windows using a text editor if the folder view option \\"Show hidden files and folders\\" is selected, the folder view option \\"Hide protected operating system files\\" is unchecked, and the \\"Read-only\\" option is unchecked under file properties. bootsect.dos is the boot sector loaded by NTLDR to load DOS, or if there is no file specified when loading a non NT-based OS. = Example = An example of a boot.ini file: [boot loader] timeout=40 default=multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\\\\WINDOWS [operating systems] multi(0)disk(0)rdisk(0)partition(1)\\\\WINDOWS=\\"Microsoft Windows XP Professional\\" /fastdetect If the boot loader timeout option in boot.ini is set to 0, the NTLDR boot menu does not appear. Extreme caution should be taken when modifying the boot loader, as erroneous information can result in an OS that fails to boot. = NT kernel switches = NTLDR Bootloader's Advanced Option Menu * ' ‚Äî Forces x86-based systems to increase the virtual address space allocated for user programs to 3 GB, and to decrease to 1 GB allocated to the kernel and to executive components. Used for some programs that require more than the standard 2 GB allocated to user programs and 2 GB allocated to the system. Some configurations of Windows Server 2003 that run virtual memory-intensive applications such as database servers or Microsoft Exchange Server 2003 may require this switch or may benefit from improved performance. Activating this option may break VMR-9 video.http://forum.videohelp.com/threads/292160-Loss-of-DirectDraw-Overlay- and-VMR9-after-upgrade-update Activating this option may also cause audio problems with Creative SB X-Fi series sound cards with (X-Fi Gamer / X-Fi Titanium @ WINXP 32-bit 3/2012). These problems may be connected to the way that Creatives drivers handle memory over 2 GB. * ' ‚Äî Forces the system into standard 640√ó480 16-color VGA mode by using a video device driver that is compatible with any video adapter. If the operating system fails to load due to a faulty or incorrectly configured video driver, this switch allows the system to load, so the user may then remove, update, or roll back the video driver causing the problem. Using this switch in conjunction with the switch helps to determine the driver that is triggering a failure. * ' ‚Äî Sets the baud rate of the debug port that is used for kernel debugging. Use of this switch automatically enables the switch. Specifies an override for the default baud rate (19200) at which a remote kernel debugger host will connect. Example: . * ' ‚Äî Turns on boot logging to a file named . * ' ‚Äî Displays an alternate 640√ó480 16-color custom bitmap. The bitmap must be saved in the \\\\Windows directory with the name . Use with the switch. * ' ‚Äî Specifies the amount of memory, in megabytes, that Windows cannot use. Use this parameter to confirm a performance problem or other problems that are related to RAM depletion. * ' ‚Äî Use with the switch and the switch to selects the IEEE 1394 interface channel (numbered 0 to 62) through which kernel debugging communications will flow. * ' ‚Äî Loads the kernel debugger at OS startup, but it remains inactive until a Stop error occurs. With this switch, the COM port can be used for normal operations while Windows is running. If Windows crashes, the switch converts the port to a debug port. (This action turns on remote debugging.) * ' ‚Äî Turns on the kernel debugger when Windows starts. Unlike the switch, uses the COM port whether you use debugging or not. * ' ‚Äî Specifies the COM port to use for the debug port. By default, uses COM2 if it exists. Otherwise, the default is COM1. Use of this switch automatically enables the switch. * ' ‚Äî Turns off serial and bus mouse detection for the specified port(s), or for all ports if none are specified. Use this switch when there is a component other than a mouse attached to a serial port during the startup process. Ports may be separated with commas to turn off more than one port. (Note: In earlier versions of Windows, including Windows NT 4.0, this switch was named .) * ' ‚Äî Defines the Hardware Abstraction Layer that is loaded at startup. This switch is useful to try out a different HAL before you rename the file to . This switch is also useful when you want to try to switch between starting in multiprocessor mode and starting in single processor mode. To do this, use this switch with the switch. filename must be in System32 directory. It can be a simple file, hard link, but not a symbolic link or a junction point. * ' ‚Äî Defines the kernel that is loaded at startup. With this switch, the user can switch between a debug-enabled kernel that is full of debugging code and a regular kernel. Same limitations for filename location and type as for /HAL switch. * ' ‚Äî Specifies the maximum amount of RAM, in megabytes, that Windows can use. However, the switch does not account for memory holes. Therefore, it is recommended to use the switch instead.MSDN: /BURNMEMORY specification * ' ‚Äî This option is used by Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE) and loads the Registry SYSTEM hive as a volatile hive such that changes made to it in memory are not saved back to the hive image. * ' ‚Äî Turns off debugging. This scenario can cause a Stop Error if a program has a debug hardcoded breakpoint in its software. * } ‚Äî This option is only available on 32-bit versions of Windows when running on processors supporting Data Execution Prevention (DEP). It enables DEP, which results in the memory manager marking pages containing data as no-execute so that they cannot be executed as code. This can be useful for preventing malicious code from exploiting buffer overflow bugs with unexpected program input in order to execute arbitrary code. No-execute protection is always enabled on 64-bit versions of Windows on processors that support no-execute protection. There are several options the user can specify with this switch: ** ' ‚Äî Enables DEP for core system images and those specified in the DEP configuration dialog. ** ' ‚Äî Enables DEP for all images except those specified in the DEP configuration dialog. ** ' ‚Äî Enables DEP on all images. ** ' ‚Äî Disables DEP. * ' ‚Äî Displays the device driver names while they are being loaded. Use with the switch to determine the driver that is triggering a failure. * ' ‚Äî Forces Ntldr to load the non-Physical Address Extension (PAE) version of the Windows kernel, even if the system is detected as supporting x86 PAEs and has more than 4 GB of physical memory. * ' ‚Äî (Obsolete on all versions post-Windows NT 4.0) Replaced by the absence of the switch. Disables serial mouse detection on the specified COM ports. Using without specifying a COM port disables serial mouse detection on all COM ports. * ' ‚Äî Sets the number of processors that Windows will run at startup. With this switch, the user can force a multiprocessor system to use only the quantity of processors (number) that you specify. Useful for troubleshooting performance problems and defective CPUs. * ' ‚Äî Equivalent to using . Causes Windows to use only one CPU on a multiprocessor system. * ' ‚Äî Enables Physical Address Extension support. In Safe Mode, the computer starts by using normal kernels, even if the switch is specified. * ' ‚Äî For x86-based systems, this stops the operating system from dynamically assigning hardware input, hardware output, and interrupt request resources to PCI devices. Instead, the BIOS configures the devices. * ' ‚Äî Turns on Emergency Management Services (EMS) on a Windows Server 2003, Enterprise Edition-based computer. To turn on EMS by editing the Boot.ini on an x86-based computer, edit both the [boot loader] section and the [operating systems] section of the Boot.ini file. * ‚Äî Causes Windows to start in Safe Mode. You must include the colon plus one of the three types listed above. An additional option the user can append is , which tells Windows to use the program specified by the value as the graphical shell rather than to use the default, which is Windows Explorer. The user can also combine other parameters with . The following examples illustrate the parameters that are in effect when you select a Safe Mode option from the startup recovery menu. (Note: The , , and switches are not required with any one of these settings, but the switches can help with troubleshooting.) ** Safe Mode () ‚Äî Default: Uses a minimal set of device drivers and services to start Windows.A description of the Safe Mode Boot options in Windows XP ** Safe Mode with Networking () ‚Äî Default mode together with the drivers necessary to load networking. ** Safe Mode with Command Prompt () ‚Äî Default mode, except that Cmd.exe starts instead of Windows Explorer. ** Windows in Directory Services Restore Mode () ‚Äî (This mode is valid only for Windows-based domain controllers.) Performs a directory service repair. * ' ‚Äî Disables the graphical boot screen and uses the NT4 style text- boot, listing the Windows build number, version number, etc. In Windows 2000 and XP, the text is rendered inside the CHKDSK bitmap (and with a progress bar in 2000). * ' ‚Äî Specifies that Windows uses the Power Management Timer (PM_TIMER) timer settings instead of the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) timer settings if the processor supports the PM_TIMER settings. By default, Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 2 (SP2) uses the PM timer for all multiprocessor APIC or ACPI HALs. If you are not running Windows Server 2003 SP2, you must force the computer to use the PM timer by using the switch.Programs that use the QueryPerformanceCounter function may perform poorly in Windows Server 2000, in Windows Server 2003, and in Windows XP * ' ‚Äî Customizes the amount of memory, in megabytes, that is allocated to processes when using the switch. This switch permits more page table entry kernel memory but still maintains almost 3 GB of process memory space. * ' ‚Äî Directs Ntldr to boot the Windows boot sector stored in . * ' ‚Äî Directs Ntldr to boot the MS-DOS boot sector stored in . * ' ‚Äî Instructs the Windows core time function to ignore the year that the computer's real-time clock reports and instead use the one indicated.

It is the biggest town and also the administrative centre of the Territoire de Belfort d√©partement. Belfort is from Paris, from Strasbourg, from Lyon and from Z√ºrich. The residents of the city are called \\"Belfortains\\". The city is located on the Savoureuse river, on a strategically important natural route between the Rhine and the Rh√¥ne ‚Äì the Belfort Gap (Trou√©e de Belfort) or Burgundian Gate (Porte de Bourgogne). It is located approximately south from the base of the Ballon d'Alsace mountain range, source of the Savoureuse. The city of Belfort has 47,656 inhabitants (2017).T√©l√©chargement du fichier d'ensemble des populations l√©gales en 2017, INSEE Together with Montb√©liard, H√©ricourt, Delle and their suburbs and satellite towns, Belfort forms the largest agglomeration (metropolitan area) in the Bourgogne-Franche-Comt√© region with an urban population of 308,601 inhabitants.  History  25 November 1944: a French woman exclaims to neighbor and American soldier: \\"Tout Belfort est libre\\" (All Belfort is free). Belfort's strategic location, in a natural gap between the Vosges and the Jura, on a route linking the Rhine and the Rh√¥ne, has attracted human settlement since Roman times, and has also made it a frequent target for invading armies many times in its history. The site of Belfort was inhabited in Gallo-Roman times. It was subsequently recorded in the 13th century as a possession of the counts of Montb√©liard, who granted it a charter in 1307. Previously an Austrian possession, Belfort was transferred to France by the Treaty of Westphalia (1648), which ended the Thirty Years' War. The town's fortifications were extended and developed by the military architect Vauban for Louis XIV. =Franco-Prussian War= Until 1871, Belfort was part of the d√©partement of Haut-Rhin, in Alsace. The Siege of Belfort (between 3 November 1870 and 18 February 1871) during the Franco Prussian war was successfully resisted by the French until the garrison was ordered to surrender 21 days after the armistice between France and Prussia ended the war. The region was not annexed by Prussia like the rest of Alsace was. It was exchanged for territories in the vicinity of Metz. It formed, as it still does, the Territoire de Belfort. The siege is commemorated by a huge statue, the Lion of Belfort, by Fr√©d√©ric Bartholdi. Alsatians not wanting to live under German rule in annexed Alsace and who wanted a French life and home in Belfort made a significant contribution to Belfort and French industry (see Soci√©t√© Alsacienne de Constructions M√©caniques) after 1872. =World War One= The town was bombarded by the German Army during World War I.Catastrophe 1914, Europe Goes to War, Max Hastings, chapter 5, \\"Death with Flags and Trumpets\\", Knopf, New York, 2013. Before the war, September Programme of German Imperial Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg, pressed for expansionist aims of French territory, specifically it advocated the annexation of the Belfort region along with the western side of the Vosges Mountains. This would have moved the French-German boundary from the Rhine River to the Vosges. =World War Two= After the 1940 Battle of France with the German victory, Belfort fell within the Nazi German occupation zone. In November 1944, the retreating Wehrmacht held off the French First Army outside the town until French Commandos made a successful night attack on the Salbert Fort. Belfort was liberated on 22 November 1944. =1892 Paris-Belfort running race= On 5 June 1892, Le Petit Journal organised a foot-race from Paris to Belfort, a course of over , the first large-scale long distance running race on record. Over 1,100 competitors registered for the event and over 800 started from the offices of Le Petit Journal, at Paris Opera. This had also been the start point for the inaugural Paris‚ÄìBrest‚ÄìParis cycle-race the previous year. The newspaper's circulation dramatically increased as the French public followed the progress of race participants, 380 of whom completed the course in under ten days. In Le Petit Journal on 18 June 1892, Pierre Giffard praised the event as a model for the physical training of a nation faced by hostile neighbours. The event was won by Constant Ramoge in 100 hours, 5 minutes.Randonneurs Ontario, Profile of Pierre Giffard  Economy  Belfort is a centre for heavy engineering industries, mostly dedicated to railways and turbines.

Belfort in the road and train network of Franche-Comt√© =Road= Like many other European cities, the volume of road traffic in Belfort continues to increases and dominates transport. Belfort is situated at only from the commercial port of Mulhouse- Rhin which allows international trade. The motorway A36 from Beaune to Mulhouse follows a route to the south and east of the city, and forms the main axis linking Belfort to other French and European cities. N19 is another major route which joins the south of Belfort with Paris, Nancy and Switzerland. =Air= EuroAirport Basel-Mulhouse-Freiburg is located about east of Belfort (1 hour drive). = Rail links = SNCF station of Belfort-Ville Belfort is well connected with the rest of France, with direct connections by train to major destinations such as Paris, Dijon, Besan√ßon, Mulhouse, Strasbourg, Lyon, Marseille, Montpellier and Lille, including high-speed trains. Some trains operate into Switzerland, such as Basel and Z√ºrich stations. There is also a train service to Frankfurt am Main in Germany. Regional services connect Belfort to Montb√©liard, Besan√ßon, Mulhouse, Vesoul, √âpinal and Nancy. *Gare de Belfort is the main railway station in the centre of the city. *Gare de Belfort ‚Äì Montb√©liard TGV is the high speed railway station, south of the city. From 2017, regional trains will connect Belfort with Belfort-Montb√©liard TGV station using the new Belfort‚ÄìDelle railway link. This service will link Belfort and the surrounding area to Switzerland, and the high-speed train link will connect Swiss towns such as Del√©mont, Bern, Fribourg and Lausanne to Paris and other cities. Before 2020, the service √âpinal-Belfort will be electrified and modernized. This will allow a link between LGV Est and LGV Rhin-Rh√¥ne in Belfort-Montb√©liard TGV station, opening new destinations like Nancy, Metz and Luxembourg. = Local transport = Cyclists in Belfort A local bus network Optymo operates within Belfort (www.optymo.fr). Tickets can be bought from any newsagent in the city, or a bus passenger can send a sms 'BUS' to 84100 and show the confirmation sms as a ticket. = Cycling tracks = The region of Belfort already offers around of cycling tracks with more under construction. Visit the local tourist office for information on the latest additions including the 'Coul√©e verte' to the west, malsaucy-giromany to the north and the Euro Velo 6 about to the south.

It is the third-largest city in the country, after Nicosia and Limassol, with a metro population of 144,200 in 2015. Larnaca is known for its palm-tree seafront also called Foinikoudes as well as the Church of Saint Lazarus, Hala Sultan Tekke, Kamares Aqueduct, and Larnaca Castle. It is built on the ruins of ancient Citium, which was the birthplace of Stoic philosopher Zeno. Larnaca is home to the country's primary airport, Larnaca International Airport. It also has a seaport and a marina. Etymology The word Larnaca derives from the Greek n. larnax, meaning: \\"coffer\\", \\"box\\", \\"chest\\", e.g. for household stores, \\"cinerary urn\\", \\"sarcophagus\\" or \\"coffin\\"; \\"drinking trough\\" and \\"chalice\\". An informal etymology, attributes the origin of the name to (sarcophagi) that were found in the area.\\"The great number sarcophagoi (larnakes) found at Larnaca may have given to the modern city its name.\\" Excerpt of wall mounted text at Larnaca District Museum, under the title \\"Kition: The necropolis\\" Sophocles Hadjisavvas, a state archeologist, states that \\"[the city's U.S.] consul of the last quarter of the 19th century, claimed to have explored more than 3,000 tombs in the area of Larnaca, so- called after the immense number of sarcophagi found in the modern town\\".The Phoenician Period Necropolis of Kition, Volume I In the vernacular, Larnaca is also known as Scala ( from the word ( a loanword from the Italian ). During the Middle Ages, until the end of the 18th century, a small port-anchorage close to Larnaca Bay is referred to on maps, engravings, in travel descriptions and documents as Scala di Saline and may account for this second name; other names that appear on maps are include: Porto delle Salines, Rada delle Saline, Ponta delle Saline, Punta delle Salino, Golfo delle Saline, Port Salines, Selines, Salines, Le Seline, Le Salline, Saline, Salin, Salinas, Arnicho di Salinas, Port of Lazarus, Lazare [o], Marine, Marina, Commercio [customs]. History Street in Larnaca in 1878 1880 drawing of market in Larnaca The former city-kingdom of Kition was originally established in the 13th century BC.According to the text on the only plaque at the Kathari site (). New cultural elements appearing between 1200 BC and 1000 BC (personal objects, pottery, new architectural forms and ideas) are interpreted as indications of significant political changes and the arrival of the Achaeans, the first Greek colonists of Kition.Excerpt of text on the only plaque at the Kathari site (). Around the same time, Phoenicians settled the area. At the archaeological sites of Kiteon, remains that date from the 13th century BC have been found. Around 1000 BC, Kition was rebuilt by Phoenicians and it subsequently became a center of Phoenician culture. The remains of the sites include cyclopean walls and a complex of five temples and a naval port. It was conquered in the first millennium BC by a series of great powers of the region. First by the Assyrian Empire, then by Egypt. Like most Cypriot cities, Kition belonged to the Persian or Achaemenid Empire. In 450 BC, the Athenian general Cimon died at sea, while militarily supporting the revolt against Persia's rule over Cyprus. On his deathbed, he urged his officers to conceal his death from both their allies and the Persians. Strong earthquakes hit the city in 76 AD and the year after. Earthquakes of 322 AD and 342 \\"caused the destruction not only of Kition but also of Salamis and Pafos\\". Kition's harbor silted up, and the population moved to the seafront farther south, sometime after this. (Contributing factors to the silting are thought to have been earthquakes, deforestation and overgrazing.) The commercial port was located at Skala, during the Ottoman Period. Skala is the name of the seashore immediately south of the Larnaca castle‚Äîand its neighborhood. The city is sometimes colloquially referred to as \\"Skala\\" () meaning \\"ladder\\" or \\"landing stage\\", referring to the historical port. The Kamares aqueduct was built in 1747‚Äîbringing water to the city from a source around from the city. Geography The Salt Lake fills with water during the winter season and is visited by flocks of flamingoes who stay there from November until the end of March. It usually dries up in the summer. In the past, it yielded good quality salt scraped from the dried surface. The salt from the lake is now considered unsuitable for consumption. =Climate= The climate in this area is described by the K√∂ppen Climate Classification System as a hot semi-arid climate (BSh) due to its low annual rainfall and strong summer drought. It is sometimes described as a mediterranean climate, but its winter rainfall is below the required amount to avoid the semi-arid classification. Landmarks The city's landmarks include: the Church of Saint Lazarus; the Catacomb of Phaneromeni Church; Hala Sultan Tekke; the Kamares Aqueduct; and the Fort of Larnaca. So-called \\"Foinikoudes\\" is the promenade along Athenon Avenue on the seafront. A row of palm trees (Cypriot Greek: foinikoudes) lines either side of it. =Monuments= Church of Saint Lazarus, Larnaca * A bust of \\"Kimon the Athenian\\" stands on the Foinikoudes Promenade, with this quote referring to him on the pedestal: \\"Even in death he was victorious\\" (). * The marble bust of Zeno stands at the crossroads near the American Academy. Zeno was born in Kition in 334 BC. After studying philosophy in Athens, he founded the famous Stoic school of philosophy. * The Armenian Genocide Memorial stands on Athinon Avenue. Economy Europe's square with government buildings Larnaca's economy has been growing since 1975, after the loss of the Port of Famagusta, which handled 80% of general cargo, and the closure of Nicosia International Airport, meant that Larnaca's airport and seaport had increasingly important roles in the economy of the island. A ‚Ç¨650m upgrade of Larnaca Airport has been completed. The service sector, including tourism, employs three-quarters of Larnaca's labour force. Many travel and tour operators and other travel- related companies have a head office Larnaca.

Mackenzie Beach hosts windsurfing centre together with an extreme sports centre. =Festivals= Much of the activity is centered on the city promenade during the major festivals. The most important of these is Kataklysmos or the Festival of the Flood, celebrated in early summer with a series of cultural events. The festival used to last for about a week, but, in recent years, with the increased commercialism of peripheral stalls, rides and temporary Loukoumades restaurants, the festival has been extended to about three weeks, during which the seafront is closed to traffic in the evenings. =Museums= Museums found in Larnaca include the Larnaca District Archaeological Museum, Pierides Museum, Agios Lazaros Byzantine Museum, Kallinikeio Municipal Museum of Athienou, Larnaca Medieval Museum, Larnaca Municipal Museum of Natural History, Larnaca Municipal Historical Archives - Museum of Larnaca, Folklore Museum ‚ÄòKostas Kaimakliotis‚Äô - Aradippou, Theasis Museum and Kyriazis Medical Museum. =Cuisine= The beaches of Larnaca are lined with nearly identical seafood restaurants catering to tourists.

Many of the staple dishes involve beans, such as fasolaki (French beans cooked in red wine with lamb), and louvi me lahana (black-eyed peas with chard). Some of the standard appetizers are potato salad, kohlrabi salad, and hot grilled black olives. The next course may include Cyprus village sausage and sheftalia, dolmades and keftedes, kolokassi in tomato sauce, and several aubergine-based dishes.

During the time of the Third Republic, he served as Prime Minister of France from 27 January 1931 to 20 February 1932, and a second time from 7 June 1935 to 24 January 1936. A socialist early in his life, Laval became a lawyer in 1909 and was famous for his defense of strikers, trade unionists and leftists against government prosecution. In 1914, he was elected to the Chamber of Deputies as a member of the Socialist Party, and remained committed to his pacifist convictions during the First World War. Following his defeat in the 1919 election, Laval left the Socialist Party and became mayor of Aubervilliers. In 1924 he returned to the Chamber as an independent, and was elected to the Senate three years later. He also held a series of governmental positions, including Minister of Public Works, Ministry of Justice and Minister of Labour. In 1931, Laval became Prime Minister of France, but his government fell only a year later. Laval joined the right-wing government of Gaston Doumergue in 1934, serving as Minister of the Colonies and then Foreign Minister. In 1935, he again became Prime Minister. Seeking to contain Germany, Laval pursued foreign policies favourable to Italy and the Soviet Union, but his handling of the Abyssinia Crisis‚Äîwidely denounced as appeasement of Benito Mussolini‚Äîprompted his resignation in 1936. Following France's defeat and armistice with Germany in 1940, Laval served in prominent roles in Philippe P√©tain's Vichy Regime, first as the vice-president of the Council of Ministers from July 1940 to December 1940, and later as the head of government from April 1942 to August 1944. The collaborationist government provided French labourers for Germany, and organized the deportation of Jews who did not have French citizenship.Cole, Hubert, Laval, New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1963, pp. 210‚Äì11. After the liberation of France in 1944, Laval fled to Spain but was soon deported back to France, where he was arrested by the French government under General Charles de Gaulle. Laval was found guilty of plotting against the security of the State and collaboration with the enemy, and after a thwarted suicide attempt, he was executed by firing squad in October 1945. Laval's manifold political activities left a complicated and controversial legacy, resulting in more than a dozen conflicting biographies of him. Early life Pierre Jean Marie Laval was born on 28 June 1883 in Ch√¢teldon, near Vichy in the northern part of Auvergne, the son of Gilbert Laval and Claudine Tournaire. His father worked as a caf√© proprietor and postman. The family was comfortably off compared to the rest of the village: the caf√© also served as a hostel and a butcher's shop, and Gilbert Laval owned a vineyard and horses. The last name \\"Laval\\" was widespread in the region at that time. The family branch was commonly named Laval-Tournaire, and his father had himself called \\"Baptiste Moulin\\". Laval was educated at the village school in Ch√¢teldon. At age 15, he was sent to the lyc√©e Saint-Louis in Paris where he obtained his baccalaur√©at in July 1901. He then continued his studies in Southwestern France, in Bordeaux and Bayonne, where he learnt Spanish and met Pierre Cathala. Returning to Lyon, he spent the next year reading for a degree in zoology and served as a supervisor in various coll√®ges and lyc√©es of Lyon, Saint-√âtienne and Autun to pay for his studies. Laval joined the socialist Central Revolutionary Committee in 1903, while he was living in Saint-√âtienne, 55 km (34 mi) southwest of Lyon. During this period, Laval became familiar with the left-wing doctrines of Georges Sorel and Hubert Lagardelle. \\"I was never a very orthodox socialist\\", he declared more than forty years later in 1945, \\"by which I mean that I was never much of a Marxist. My socialism was much more a socialism of the heart than a doctrinal socialism ... I was much more interested in men, their jobs, their misfortunes and their conflicts than in the digressions of the great German pontiff.\\"Jaffr√©, Yves-Fr√©d√©ric, Les: Derniers Propos de Pierre Laval, Paris: Andre Bonne, 1953, p. 55. In 1903, he was called up for military service and, after serving in the ranks, was discharged for varicose veins. Laval returned to Paris in 1907 at the age of 24. In April 1913 he said that \\"barrack-based armies [were] incapable of the slightest effort, because they are badly-trained and, above all, badly commanded.\\" Laval favoured abolition of the army and replacement by a citizens' militia.Privat, Maurice, Pierre Laval, Paris: Editions Les Documents secrets, 1931, pp. 67‚Äì8. Career as a lawyer Pierre Laval in 1913. Abandoning natural science studies, Laval eventually turned to law and became in 1909 a \\"lawyer of the poor people\\", closed to syndicalists of the CGT. The years before the First World War were characterised by labour unrest, and Laval defended strikers, trade unionists, and left-wing agitators against government attempts to prosecute them. At a trade union conference, Laval said: The first case that led him to fame was the acquittal of Gustave Manh√®s, a revolutionary trade unionist charged with possession of explosives and anarchist manuals. Laval married Jeanne Claussat in 1909, the daughter of Socialist politician Dr Joseph Claussat. Their only child, a daughter named Jos√©e, was born in 1911. Jos√©e married Ren√© de Chambrun, whose uncle, Nicholas Longworth III, married Alice Roosevelt, daughter of United States President Theodore Roosevelt. Although Laval's wife came from a political family, she never participated in politics. Laval was generally considered to be devoted to his family. In 1911, he ran for parliament in the Neuilly-Boulogne electoral district, and caused the victory of Conservative candidate √âdouard Nortier by continuing to stand in the second round face to Radical candidate Alexandre Percin. During the First World War =Socialist Deputy for the Seine= In April 1914, as fear of war swept the nation, the Socialists and Radicals geared up their electoral campaign in defence of peace. Their leaders were Jean Jaur√®s and Joseph Caillaux. The Bloc des Gauches (\\"Lefts Bloc\\") denounced the law passed in July 1913 extending compulsory military service from two to three years. In the 1914 legislative election, held three months before the outbreak of World War I, the trade unions sought Laval as Socialist candidate for the Seine, the district comprising Paris and its suburbs. Laval was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in the second electoral district of Saint-Denis. At nearly 31, he was the youngest member of the Chamber. The Radicals, with the support of Socialists, held the majority in the French Chamber of Deputies. Together they hoped to avert war. The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on 28 June 1914 and of Jaur√®s on 31 July 1914 shattered those hopes. Laval's brother, Jean, died in the first months of the war. Laval was listed in the Carnet B, a compilation of potentially subversive elements who might hinder mobilisation. In the name of national unity, Minister of the Interior Jean-Louis Malvy, despite pressure from chiefs of staff, refused to have anyone apprehended. Laval remained true to his pacifist convictions during the war. In December 1915, Jean Longuet, grandson of Karl Marx, proposed to Socialist parliamentarians that they communicate with socialists of other states, hoping to press governments into a negotiated peace. Laval signed on, but the motion was defeated. With France's resources geared for war, goods were scarce or overpriced. On 30 January 1917, in the National Assembly Laval called upon the Supply Minister √âdouard Herriot to deal with the inadequate coal supply in Paris. When Herriot said, \\"If I could, I would unload the barges myself\\", Laval retorted \\"Do not add ridicule to ineptitude\\".\\"Herriot g√©mit: 'Si je pouvais, j'irais d√©charger moi-m√™me les p√©niches.' La voix rauque du jeune d√©put√© de la Seine s'√©l√®ve, implacable: 'N'ajoutez pas le ridicule √† l'incapacit√©!' Mallet, Pierre Laval des Ann√©es obscures, 18‚Äì19. The words delighted the assembly and attracted the attention of Georges Clemenceau, but left the relationship between Laval and Herriot permanently strained. =Stockholm, the \\"polar star\\"= Laval scorned the conduct of the war and the poor supply of troops in the field. When mutinies broke out after General Robert Nivelle's offensive of April 1917 at Chemin des Dames, he spoke in defence of the mutineers. When Marcel Cachin and Marius Moutet returned from St. Petersburg in June 1917 with the invitation to a socialist convention in Stockholm, Laval saw a chance for peace. In an address to the Assembly, he urged the chamber to allow a delegation to go: \\"Yes, Stockholm, in response to the call of the Russian Revolution... Yes, Stockholm, for peace... Yes, Stockholm the polar star.\\" The request was denied. The hope of peace in spring 1917 was overwhelmed by discovery of traitors, some real, some imagined, as with Malvy who became a suspect because he had refused to arrest Frenchmen on the Carnet B. Laval's \\"Stockholm, √©toile polaire\\" speech had not been forgotten. Many of Laval's acquaintances, the publishers of the anarchist Bonnet rouge, and other pacifists were arrested or interrogated. Though Laval frequented pacifist circles ‚Äì it was said that he was acquainted with Leon Trotsky ‚Äì the authorities did not pursue him. His status as a deputy, his caution, and his friendships protected him. In November 1917, Clemenceau became Prime Minister and offered Laval a post in his government. Laval refused, as the Socialist Party refused to enter any government, but he questioned the wisdom of such a policy in a meeting of the Socialist members of parliament. Initial postwar career =From Socialist to Independent= In the 1919 elections the Socialists' record of pacifism, their opposition to Clemenceau, and anxiety arising from the excesses of the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia contributed to their defeat by the conservative Bloc National. Laval lost his seat in the Chamber of Deputies. The General Confederation of Labour (Conf√©d√©ration G√©n√©rale du Travail - CGT), with 2,400,000 members, launched a general strike in 1920, which petered out as thousands of workers were laid off. In response, the government sought to dissolve the CGT. Laval, with Joseph Paul-Boncour as chief counsel, defended the union's leaders, saving the union by appealing to the ministers Th√©odore Steeg (interior) and Auguste Isaac (commerce and industry). Laval's relations with the Socialist Party drew to an end. The last years with the Socialist caucus in the chamber combined with the party's disciplinary policies eroded Laval's attachment to the cause. With the Bolshevik victory in Russia the party was changing; at the Congress of Tours in December 1920, the Socialists split into two ideological components: the French Communist Party (SFIC later PC-SFIC), inspired by Moscow, and the more moderate French Section of the Workers' International (SFIO). Laval let his membership lapse, not taking sides as the two factions battled over the legacy of Jean Jaur√®s. =Mayor of Aubervilliers= In 1923 Aubervilliers in northern Paris needed a mayor. As a former deputy of the constituency, Laval was an obvious candidate. To be eligible for election, Laval bought farmland, Les Bergeries. Few were aware of his defection from the Socialists. Laval was also asked by the local SFIO and Communist Party to head their lists. Laval chose to run under his own list, of former socialists he convinced to leave the party and work for him. This was an independent Socialist Party of sorts that existed only in Aubervilliers. In a four-way race, Laval won in the second round. He served as mayor of Aubervilliers until just before his death. Laval was seen as '; a joke stated that he was so clever that he was born with a name that is spelled the same from left or from right. Laval won over those he defeated by cultivating personal contacts. He developed a network among the humble and the well-to-do in Aubervilliers, and with mayors of neighbouring towns. He was the only independent politician in the suburb. He avoided entering the ideological war between socialists and communists. =Independent Deputy for the Seine= In the 1924 legislative elections, the SFIO and the Radicals formed a national coalition known as the Cartel des Gauches. Laval headed a list of independent socialists in the Seine. The cartel won and Laval regained a seat in the National Assembly. His first act was to bring back Joseph Caillaux, former Prime Minister, Cabinet member and member of the National Assembly and once the star of the Radical Party. Clemenceau had had Caillaux arrested toward the end of the war for collusion with the enemy. He spent two years in prison and lost his civic rights. Laval stood for Caillaux's pardon and won. Caillaux became an influential patron. As a member of the government =Minister and senator= Laval's reward for support of the cartel was appointment as Minister of Public Works in the government of Paul Painlev√© in April 1925. Six months later, the government collapsed. Laval from then on belonged to the club of former ministers from which new ministers were drawn. Between 1925 and 1926 Laval participated three more times in governments of Aristide Briand, once as under-secretary to the premier and twice as Minister of Justice (garde des sceaux). When he first became Minister of Justice, Laval abandoned his law practice to avoid conflict of interest. Laval's momentum was frozen after 1926 through a reshuffling of the cartel majority orchestrated by the Radical- Socialist mayor and deputy of Lyon, √âdouard Herriot. Founded in 1901, the Radical Party became the hinge faction of the Third Republic, whose support or defection often meant survival or collapse of governments. Through this latest swing, Laval was excluded from the government of France for four years. Author Gaston Jacquemin suggested that Laval chose not to partake in a Herriot government, which he judged incapable of handling the financial crisis. 1926 marked the definitive break between Laval and the left, but he maintained friends on the left. In 1927 Laval was elected Senator for the Seine, withdrawing from and placing himself above the political battles for majorities in the Chamber of Deputies. He longed for a constitutional reform to strengthen the executive branch and eliminate political instability, the flaw of the Third Republic. On 2 March 1930 Laval returned as Minister of Labour in the second Andr√© Tardieu government. Tardieu and Laval knew each other from the days of Clemenceau, and had come to appreciate one another's qualities. Tardieu needed men he could trust: his previous government had collapsed a little over a week earlier because of the defection of the minister of Labour, Louis Loucheur. But, when the Radical Socialist Camille Chautemps failed to form a viable government, Tardieu was called back. =Personal investments= From 1927 to 1930, Laval began to accumulate a sizeable personal fortune; after the war his wealth resulted in charges that he had used his political position to line his own pockets. \\"I have always thought\\", he wrote to the examining magistrate on 11 September 1945, \\"that a soundly based material independence, if not indispensable, gives those statesmen who possess it a much greater political independence.\\" Until 1927 his principal source of income had been his fees as a lawyer and in that year they totalled 113,350 francs, according to his income tax returns. Between August 1927 and June 1930, he undertook large-scale investments in various enterprises, totalling 51 million francs. Not all this money was his own; it came from a group of financiers who had the backing of an investment trust, the Union Syndicale et Financi√®re and two banks, the Comptoir Lyon Allemand and the Banque Nationale de Cr√©dit.Warner, Geoffrey, Pierre Laval and the Eclipse of France, New York: The Macmillan Company, 1968, pp. 19‚Äì20. Two of the investments which Laval and his backers acquired were provincial newspapers, Le Moniteur du Puy-de-D√¥me and its associated printing works at Clermont-Ferrand, and the Lyon R√©publicain. The circulation of the Moniteur stood at 27,000 in 1926 before Laval took it over. By 1933, it had more than doubled, peaking at 58,250, but declining thereafter. Profits varied, but during the seventeen years of his control, Laval earned some 39 million francs in income from the paper and the printing works combined. The renewed plant was valued at 50 million francs, which led the high court expert in 1945 to say with some justification that it had been \\"an excellent deal for him.\\"Warner, p. 20. =Minister of Labour and Social Insurance= More than 150,000 textile workers were on strike, and violence was feared. As Minister of Public Works in 1925, Laval had ended the strike of mine workers. Tardieu hoped he could do the same as Minister of Labour. The conflict was settled without bloodshed. Socialist politician L√©on Blum, never one of Laval's allies, conceded that Laval's \\"intervention was skillful, opportune and decisive.\\" L√©on Blum, L'≈íuvre de L√©on Blum, R√©parations et D√©sarmement, Les Probl√®mes de la Paix, La Mont√©e des Fascismes, 1918‚Äì1934 (Paris: Albin Michel, 1972), 263. Social insurance had been on the agenda for ten years. It had passed the Chamber of Deputies, but not the Senate, in 1928. Tardieu gave Laval until May Day to get the project through. The date was chosen to stifle the agitation of Labour Day. Laval's first effort went into clarifying the muddled collection of texts. He then consulted employer and labour organisations. Laval had to reconcile the divergent views of Chamber and Senate. \\"Had it not been for Laval's unwearying patience\\", Laval's associate Tissier wrote, \\"an agreement would never have been achieved\\".Tissier, Pierre, I worked with Laval, London: Harrap, 1942, p. 48. In two months Laval presented the Assembly a text which overcame its original failure. It met the financial constraints, reduced the control of the government, and preserved the choice of doctors and their billing freedom. The Chamber and the Senate passed the law with an overwhelming majority. When the bill had passed its final stages, Tardieu described his Minister of Labour as \\"displaying at every moment of the discussion as much tenacity as restraint and ingenuity.\\" First Laval government Premier Laval is second from left, at a 1931 diplomatic function in Germany Tardieu's government ultimately proved unable to weather the Oustric Affair. After the failure of the Oustric Bank, it appeared that members of the government had improper ties to it. The scandal involved Minister of Justice Raoul P√©ret, and Under-Secretaries Henri Falcoz and Eug√®ne Lautier. Though Tardieu was not involved, on 4 December 1930, he lost his majority in the Senate. President Gaston Doumergue called on Louis Barthou to form a government, but Barthou failed. Doumergue turned to Laval, who fared no better. The following month the government formed by Th√©odore Steeg floundered. Doumergue renewed his offer to Laval. On 27 January 1931 Laval successfully formed his first government. In the words of L√©on Blum, the Socialist opposition was amazed and disappointed that the ghost of Tardieu's government reappeared within a few weeks of being defeated with Laval at its head, \\"like a night bird surprised by the light.\\" Laval's nomination as premier led to speculation that Tardieu, the new agriculture minister, held the real power in the Laval Government. Although Laval thought highly of Tardieu and Briand, and applied policies in line with theirs, Laval was not Tardieu's mouthpiece. Ministers who formed the Laval government were in great part those who had formed Tardieu governments but that was a function of the composite majority Laval could find at the National Assembly. Raymond Poincar√©, Aristide Briand and Tardieu before him had offered ministerial posts to Herriot's Radicals, but to no avail. Besides Briand, Andr√© Maginot, Pierre- √âtienne Flandin, and Paul Reynaud, Laval brought in as his advisors, friends such as Maurice Foulon from Aubervilliers and Pierre Cathala, whom he knew from his days in Bayonne and who had worked in Laval's Labour ministry. Cathala began as Under-Secretary of the Interior and was appointed as Minister of the Interior in January 1932. Blaise Diagne of Senegal, the first African deputy, had been elected to the National Assembly at the same time as Laval in 1914. Laval invited Diagne to join his cabinet as under-secretary to the colonies; he was the first Black African appointed to a cabinet position in a French government. Laval also called on financial experts such as Jacques Rueff, Charles Rist and Ad√©odat Boissard. Andr√© Fran√ßois-Poncet was appointed as under-secretary to the premier and then as ambassador to Germany. Laval's government included an economist, Claude-Joseph Gignoux, when economists in government service were rare. France in 1931 was unaffected by the world economic crisis. Laval declared on embarking for the United States on 16 October 1931, \\"France remained healthy thanks to work and savings.\\" Agriculture, small industry, and protectionism were the bases of France's economy. With a conservative policy of contained wages and limited social services, France had accumulated the largest gold reserves in the world after the United States. France reaped the benefit of devaluation of the franc orchestrated by Poincar√©, which made French products competitive on the world market. In the whole of France, 12,000 people were recorded as unemployed. Laval and his cabinet considered the economy and gold reserves as means to diplomatic ends. Laval left to visit London, Berlin and Washington. He attended conferences on the world crisis, war reparations and debt, disarmament, and the gold standard. =Role in 1931 Austrian financial crisis= In 1931, Austria underwent a banking crisis when its largest bank, the Creditanstalt, was revealed to be nearly bankrupt, threatening a worldwide financial crisis. World leaders began negotiating the terms for an international loan to Austria's central government to sustain its financial system; however, Laval blocked the proposed package for nationalistic reasons. He demanded that France receive a series of diplomatic concessions in exchange for its support, including renunciation of a prospective German-Austrian customs union. This proved to be fatal for the negotiations, which ultimately fell through.Eichengreen, Barry and Harold James. International Monetary Cooperation Since Bretton Woods, P268 As a result, the Creditanstalt declared bankruptcy on 11 May 1931, precipitating a crisis that quickly spread to other nations. Within four days, bank runs in Budapest were underway, and the bank failures began spreading to Germany and Britain, among others.Eichengreen and James, p. 270. =Hoover Moratorium (20 June 1931)= The Hoover Moratorium of 1931, a proposal made by American President Herbert Hoover to freeze all intergovernmental debt repayments for a one-year period, was, according to author and political advisor McGeorge Bundy, \\"the most significant action taken by an American president for Europe since Woodrow Wilson's administration.\\" The United States had enormous stakes in Germany: long-term German borrowers owed the United States private sector more than $1.25 billion; the short-term debt neared $1 billion. By comparison, the entire United States national income in 1931 was just $54 billion. To put it into perspective, authors Walter Lippmann and William O. Scroggs stated in The United States in World Affairs, an Account of American Foreign Relations, that \\"the American stake in Germany's government and private obligations was equal to half that of all the rest of the world combined.\\" The proposed moratorium would also benefit Great Britain's investment in Germany's private sector, making more likely the repayment of those loans while the public indebtedness was frozen. It was in Hoover's interest to offer aid to an ailing British economy in the light of the indebtedness of Great Britain to the United States. France, on the other hand, had a relatively small stake in Germany's private debt but a huge interest in German reparations, and payment to France would be compromised under Hoover's moratorium. The scheme was further complicated by ill timing; perceived collusion among the US, Great Britain and Germany, and the fact that it constituted a breach of the Young Plan. Such breach could only be approved in France by the National Assembly; the survival of the Laval Government rested on the legislative body's approval of the moratorium. Seventeen days elapsed between the proposal and the vote of confidence of the French legislators. That delay was blamed for the lack of success of the Hoover Moratorium. The US Congress did not approve it until December 1931. In support of the Hoover Moratorium Laval undertook a year of personal and direct diplomacy by which he traveled to London, Berlin and the United States. While there were considerable domestic achievements to his name, his international efforts were short on results. British Premier Ramsay MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Arthur Henderson-- preoccupied by internal political divisions and the collapse of the pound sterling-- were unable to help. German Chancellor Heinrich Br√ºning and Foreign Minister Julius Curtius, both eager for Franco-German reconciliation, were under siege on all sides. They faced a very weak economy which made meeting the government payroll a weekly miracle. Private bankruptcies and constant layoffs had the Communists on a short fuse. At the other end of the political spectrum, the German Army was spying on the Br√ºning cabinet and feeding information to Der Stahlhelm and the National Socialists, effectively freezing any overtures towards France. In the United States the conference between Hoover and Laval was an exercise in mutual frustration. Hoover's plan for a reduced military had been rebuffed-- albeit gently. A solution to the Danzig corridor problem had been retracted. The concept of introducing a silver standard for countries which left the gold standard was viewed by Laval and Fran√ßois Albert-Buisson as a frivolous proposal. Hoover thought it might have helped \\"Mexico, India, China and South America\\", but Laval dismissed the silver solution as an inflationary proposition, adding that \\"it was cheaper to inflate paper.\\"\\"Memorandum of Conference with Laval\\", Stimson, Diary, 23 October 1931. Laval did not get a security pact, without which the French would never consider disarmament, nor did he obtain an endorsement for the political moratorium. The promise to match any reduction of German reparations with a decrease of the French debt was not put in the communiqu√©. The joint statement declared the attachment of France and the United States to the gold standard. The two governments also agreed that the Banque de France and the Federal Reserve would consult each other before transfers of gold. This was welcome news after the run on American gold in the preceding weeks. In light of the financial crisis, the leaders agreed to review the economic situation in Germany before the Hoover moratorium had run its course. These were meagre political results. The Hoover‚ÄìLaval encounter, however, had other effects: it made Laval more widely known and raised his standing in the United States and France. The American and French press were smitten. His optimism was such a contrast to his grim- sounding international contemporaries that in Time magazine named him as the 1931 Man of the Year, an honour never bestowed before on a Frenchman. He followed Mohandas K. Gandhi and preceded Franklin D. Roosevelt in receiving the honour. 1934‚Äì36 The second Cartel des Gauches (Left-Wing Cartel) resigned following the 6 February 1934 crisis involving anti-parliamentarist groups, composed of far-right leagues, veterans organizations, and the French Communist Party(PCF). Laval and Marshal Philippe P√©tain had contacts with some conservative politicians among the groups involved. Laval became Minister of Colonies in the new right-wing government of Gaston Doumergue. In October, Foreign Minister Louis Barthou was assassinated; Laval succeeded him, holding that office until 1936. At this time, Laval was opposed to Germany, the \\"hereditary enemy\\" of France, and he pursued anti-German alliances. He met with Mussolini in Rome, and they signed the Franco-Italian Agreement of 1935 on 4 January. The agreement ceded parts of French Somaliland to Italy and allowed her a free hand in Abyssinia, in exchange for support against any German aggression.Andr√© Laran√©, 4 janvier 1935: Laval rencontre Mussolini √† Rome, H√©rodote . Laval denied that he gave Mussolini a free hand in Abyssinia; he even wrote to Il Duce on the subject.For the only complete correspondence between Laval and Mussolini regarding this affair consult Benito Mussolini, Opera Omnia di Benito Mussolini, vol. XXVII, Dall'Inaugurazione Della Provincia Di Littoria Alla Proclamazione Dell'Impero (19 Dicembre 1934-9 Maggio 1936), eds. Edoardo and Duilio Susmel (Florence: La Fenice, 1951), 287. In April 1935, Laval persuaded Italy and Great Britain to join France in the Stresa Front against German ambitions in Austria. On 2 May 1935, he likewise signed the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance.League of Nations Treaty Series, Vol. 167, pp. 396‚Äì406. Laval's primary aim during the build-up to the Italo-Abyssinian War was to retain Italy as an anti-German power and not to drive her into Germany's hands by adopting a hostile attitude to an invasion of Abyssinia.D. W. Brogan, The Development of Modern France (1870-1939) (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1945), pp. 692‚Äì693. According to the English historian Correlli Barnett, in Laval's view \\"all that really mattered was Nazi Germany. His eyes were on the demilitarised zone of the Rhineland; his thoughts on the Locarno guarantees. To estrange Italy, one of the Locarno powers, over such a question as Abyssinia did not appeal to Laval's Auvergnat peasant mind\\".Correlli Barnett, The Collapse of British Power (London: Methuen, 1972), p. 353.\\"Laval... was very reluctant to lose the fruits of his diplomacy, the separation of Italy and Germany, for such trivial reasons... He believed that to risk the loss of so important a stabilizing force in Europe as Italy, merely because of formal obligations to Abyssinia, was absurd\\". Brogan, p. 693. In June 1935, he became Prime Minister as well. In October 1935, Laval and British foreign minister Samuel Hoare proposed a realpolitik solution to the Abyssinia Crisis. When leaked to the media in December, the Hoare‚ÄìLaval Pact was widely denounced as appeasement of Mussolini. Laval was forced to resign on 22 January 1936, and was driven completely out of ministerial politics. The victory of the Popular Front in 1936 meant that Laval had a left-wing government as a target for his media. Under Vichy France =Formation of the Vichy Government= During the Phoney War, Laval was cautiously ambivalent towards the conflict. He was on record as saying in March 1940 that although the war could have been avoided by diplomatic means, it was now up to the government to prosecute it with the utmost vigour.Warner, p. 149. On 9 June 1940, the Germans were advancing on a front of more than in length across the entire width of France. As far as General Maxime Weygand was concerned, \\"if the Germans crossed the Seine and the Marne, it was the end.\\"Weygand, General Maxime, M√©moirs, Vol. III, Paris: Flammarion, 1950, pp. 168‚Äì88. Simultaneously, Marshal Philippe P√©tain was increasing the pressure upon Prime Minister Paul Reynaud to call for an armistice. During this time Laval was in Ch√¢teldon. On 10 June, in view of the German advance, the government left Paris for Tours. Weygand had informed Reynaud: \\"the final rupture of our lines may take place at any time.\\" If that happened \\"our forces would continue to fight until their strength and resources were extinguished. But their disintegration would be no more than a matter of time.\\"Warner, pp. 189‚Äì90. Weygand had avoided using the word armistice, but it was on the minds of all those involved. Reynaud was opposed to an armistice. During this time Laval had left Ch√¢teldon for Bordeaux, where his daughter nearly convinced him of the necessity of going to the United States. Instead, it was reported that he was sending \\"messengers and messengers\\" to P√©tain.Baudouin, Paul, Neuf Mois au Gouvernement, Paris: La Table Ronde, 1948, p. 166. As the Germans occupied Paris, P√©tain was asked to form a new government. To everyone's surprise, he produced a list of his ministers, convincing proof that he had been expecting and had prepared for the president's summons.Lebrun, Albert, T√©moignages, Paris: Plon, 1945. p. 85. When informed that he was to be appointed Minister of Justice, Laval's temper and ambitions became apparent as he ferociously demanded of P√©tain, despite the objections of other men of government, that he be made Minister of Foreign Affairs. Laval realised that only through this position could he effect a reversal of alliances and bring himself to favour with Nazi Germany, the military power he viewed as the inevitable victor. However the Permanent Under-Secretary, Charles-Roux, refused to serve under Laval.Churchill, Winston S., \\"The Second World War, Vol. 2\\", p. 216. One consequence of these events was that Laval was later able to claim that he was not part of the government that requested the armistice. His name did not appear in the chronicles of events until June when he began to assume a more active role in criticising the government's decision to leave France for North Africa. Vichy France Although the final terms of the armistice were harsh, the French colonial empire was left untouched and the French government was allowed to nominally administer the occupied and unoccupied zones, provided that it obey German directives. The concept of \\"collaboration\\" was written into the Armistice Convention, before Laval joined the government. The French representatives who affixed their signatures to the text accepted the term. =Laval in the Vichy government, 1940‚Äì41= By this time, Laval had veered and now openly sympathized with National Socialism. He was convinced that Germany would win the war, and felt France needed to emulate its totalitarian regime as much as possible. To that end, when he was included in the cabinet as minister of state, Laval set about with the work for which he is remembered: dismantling the Third Republic and its democracy and taking up the fascist cause.Darkness in Paris: The Allies and the eclipse of France 1940, Scribe Publications, Melbourne, Australia 2005, p. 277. In October 1940, Laval understood collaboration more or less in the same sense as P√©tain. For both, to collaborate meant to give up the least possible to get the most in return.*Chambrun, Ren√© de, Pierre Laval, Traitor or Patriot? (Translated by Elly Stein), New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1984, p. 50. Laval, in his role of go-between, was forced to be in constant touch with the German authorities, to shift ground, to be wily, and to plan ahead. All this, under the circumstances, drew more attention to him than to the Marshal and made him appear to many Frenchmen as \\"the agent of collaboration\\"; to others, he was \\"the Germans' man\\".Chambrun, pp. 49‚Äì50. The meetings between P√©tain and Adolf Hitler, and between Laval and Hitler, are often used as evidence of Vichy collaboration with the Nazis. In fact Montoire (24‚Äì26 October 1940) was a disappointment to both sides. Hitler wanted France to declare war on Britain, and the French wanted improved relations with her conqueror. Neither happened. Virtually the only concession the French obtained was the 'Berlin protocol' of 16 November 1940, which provided release of certain categories of French prisoners of war. In November 1940, Laval took a number of pro-German decisions of his own, without consulting with colleagues. The most notorious examples concerned turning the RTB Bor copper mines and the Belgian gold reserves over to Nazi control. After the war, Laval's justification, apart from a denial that he acted unilaterally, was that Vichy was powerless to prevent the Germans from gaining something they were clearly so eager to obtain.Warner, p. 246. Laval's actions were a factor in his dismissal on 13 December 1940. P√©tain asked all the ministers to sign a collective letter of resignation during a full cabinet meeting. Laval did so thinking it was a device to get rid of M. Belin, the Minister of Labor. He was therefore stunned when the Marshal announced, \\"the resignations of MM. Laval and Ripert are accepted.\\"Warner, p. 255. That evening, Laval was arrested and driven by the police to his home in Ch√¢teldon. The following day, P√©tain announced his decision to remove Laval from the government. The reason for Laval's dismissal lies in a fundamental incompatibility with P√©tain. Laval's methods of working appeared slovenly to Petain's precise military mind, and he showed a marked lack of deference, instanced by a habit of blowing cigarette smoke in P√©tain's face. By doing so he aroused P√©tain's irritation and the anger of the entire cabinet.Jaffr√©, Yves-Fr√©d√©ric, Les Derniers Propos de Pierre Laval, Paris: Andre Bonne, 1953, p. 164. On 27 August 1941, several top Vichyites including Laval attended a review of the L√©gion des Volontaires Fran√ßais (LVF), a collaborationist militia. Paul Collette, a member of the Croix-de-Feu, shot Laval (and also Marcel D√©at, another prominent collaborationist), during a troop revue, slightly wounding him. Laval soon recovered from the injury. =Return to power, 1942= Laval and P√©tain in Frank Capra's documentary film Divide and Conquer (1943) Laval returned to power in April 1942. In a radio speech he gave on 22 June 1942 he outlined his policy objectives, expressing his \\"desire to re-establish normal and trusting relations with Germany and Italy\\". He added he \\"wished for a German victory\\" because otherwise \\"Bolshevism [would] establish itself everywhere.\\"Lachaise, Bernard, Documents d'histoire contemporaine: Le XXe si√®cle, Presses Universitaires de Bordeaux, 2000, 278 p., , p. 122. Laval had been in power for a mere two months when he was faced with the decision of providing forced workers to Germany. The Reich was short of skilled labour due to its need for troop replacements on the Russian front. Unlike other occupied countries, France was technically protected by the armistice, and its workers could not be simply rounded up for transportation. In the occupied zone the Germans used intimidation and control of raw materials to create unemployment, thus creating reasons for French labourers to volunteer to work in Germany. Nazi officials demanded Laval send more than 300,000 skilled workers immediately to factories in Germany. Laval delayed, making a counter-offer of one worker in return for one French POW. The proposal was sent to Hitler, and a compromise was reached: one prisoner of war to be repatriated for every three workers arriving in Germany.Warner, pp. 307‚Äì10, 364. Laval's precise role in the deportation of Jews has been hotly debated by both his accusers and defenders. The Germans never told the Vichy French authorities about the extermination camps; instead the French were told that Jews were being deported as forced labour for the Axis war effort. When ordered to have all Jews in France rounded up to be transported to German- occupied Poland, Laval negotiated a compromise. He allowed only those Jews who were not French citizens to be forfeited to German control. It was estimated that by the end of the war, the Germans had killed 90 percent of the Jewish population in other occupied countries, but in France fifty per cent of the pre-war French and foreign Jewish population, with perhaps ninety per cent of the purely French Jewish population still remaining alive.Cole, Hubert, Laval, New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1963, pp. 210‚Äì11. Laval went beyond the orders given to him by the Germans, as he included Jewish children under 16, whom the Germans had given him permission to spare, in the deportations. In his book Churches and the Holocaust, Mordecai Paldiel claims that when Protestant leader Marc Boegner visited Laval to remonstrate, Laval claimed that he had ordered children to be deported along with their parents because families should not be separated and \\"children should remain with their parents\\".Paldiel, Mordecai. Churches and the Holocaust: Unholy Teaching, Good Samaritans, and Reconciliation, p. 82. According to Paldiel, when Boegner argued that the children would almost certainly die, Laval replied \\"not one [Jewish child] must remain in France\\". Sarah Fishman (in a reliably sourced book, but lacking citations) writes that Laval also attempted to prevent Jewish children gaining visas to the United States, arranged by the American Friends Service Committee, and that Laval was committed less to expelling Jewish children from France than to making sure they reached Nazi camps.Fishman, Sarah. The Battle for Children: World War II, Youth Crime, and Juvenile Justice in Twentieth-century France (Harvard University Press; 2002), p. 73. Laval with the head of German police units in France, Carl Oberg More and more the insoluble dilemma of collaboration faced Laval and his chief of staff, Jean Jardin. Laval had to maintain Vichy's authority to prevent Germany from installing a Quisling Government made up of French Nazis such as Jacques Doriot.Warner, p. 303. =Leader of the Milice, 1943‚Äì45= In 1943, Laval became the nominal leader of the newly created Milice, though its operational leader was Secretary General Joseph Darnand.Warner, p. 387. When the Allied landings in French North Africa (Operation Torch) began, the Wehrmacht occupied the Zone libre. Hitler continued to ask whether the French government was prepared to fight at his side, requiring Vichy to declare war against Britain. Laval and P√©tain agreed to maintain a firm refusal. During this time and the Normandy landings in 1944, Laval was in a struggle against ultra- collaborationist ministers. In a speech broadcast on the Normandy landings' D-day, he appealed to the nation: About two months later, he and some others were arrested by the Germans and transported to Belfort.they arrived there on 19 August 1944 (Fred Kupferman (2016): Pierre Laval, online, ). In view of the speed of the Allied advance, on 7 September 1944 what was left of the Vichy government was moved from Belfort to the Sigmaringen enclave in Germany. P√©tain took residence at the Hohenzollern castle in Sigmaringen. At first Laval also resided in this castle. In January 1945 Laval was assigned to the Stauffenberg castle in Wilflingenthen owned by Franz Schenk von Stauffenberg. 12 km outside the Sigmaringen enclave. By April 1945 US General George S. Patton's army approached Sigmaringen, so the Vichy ministers were forced to seek their own refuge. Laval received permission to enter Spain and was flown to Barcelona by a Luftwaffe plane. However, 90 days later, de Gaulle pressured Spain to expel Laval. The same Luftwaffe plane that flew him to Spain flew him to the American-occupied zone of Austria. The American authorities immediately arrested Laval and his wife and turned them over to the Free French. They were flown to Paris to be imprisoned at Fresnes Prison. Madame Laval was later released; Pierre Laval remained in prison to be tried for treason.Warner, pp. 404‚Äì407. Prior to his arrest, Laval had planned to move to Sintra, Portugal, where a house had been leased for him. Trial and execution Two trials were to be held. Although it had its faults, the P√©tain trial permitted the presentation and examination of a vast amount of pertinent material. Scholars including Robert Paxton and Geoffrey Warner believe that Laval's trial demonstrated the inadequacies of the judicial system and the poisonous political atmosphere of that purge-trial era.Paxton, Robert O., Vichy France, Old Guard and New Order 1940‚Äì1944, New York: Columbia University Press, 1972 (1982), p. 425.Warner, p. 408. During his imprisonment pending the verdict of his treason trial, Laval wrote his only book, his posthumously published Diary (1948). His daughter, Jos√©e de Chambrun, smuggled it out of the prison page by page.Laval, Pierre, The Diary of Pierre Laval (With a Preface by his daughter, Jos√©e Laval), New York: Scribner's Sons, 1948. Laval firmly believed that he would be able to convince his fellow-countrymen that he had been acting in their best interests all along. \\"Father-in-law wants a big trial which will illuminate everything\\", Ren√© de Chambrun told Laval's lawyers: \\"If he is given time to prepare his defence, if he is allowed to speak, to call witnesses and to obtain from abroad the information and documents which he needs, he will confound his accusers.\\"Naud, Albert. Pourquoi je n'ai pas d√©fendu Pierre Laval, Paris: Fayard, 1948. \\"Do you want me to tell you the set-up?\\" Laval asked one of his lawyers on 4 August. \\"There will be no pre-trial hearings and no trial. I will be condemned ‚Äì and got rid of ‚Äì before the elections.\\"Baraduc, Jaques, Dans la Cellule de Pierre Laval, Paris: Editions Self, 1948, p. 31. Laval's trial began at 1:30 pm on Thursday, 4 October 1945. He was charged with plotting against the security of the State and intelligence (collaboration) with the enemy. He had three defence lawyers (Jaques Baraduc, Albert Naud, and Yves-Fr√©d√©ric Jaffr√©). None of his lawyers had met him before. He saw most of Jaffr√©, who sat with him, talked, listened and took down notes that he wanted to dictate. Baraduc, who quickly became convinced of Laval's innocence, kept contact with the Chambruns and at first shared their conviction that Laval would be acquitted or at most receive a sentence of temporary exile. Naud, who had been a member of the Resistance, believed Laval to be guilty and urged him to plead that he had made grave errors but had acted under constraint. Laval would not listen to him; he was convinced that he was innocent and could prove it. \\"He acted\\", said Naud, \\"as if his career, not his life, was at stake.\\"Cole, Hubert, Laval, New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1963, pp. 280‚Äì1. All three of his lawyers declined to be in court to hear the reading of the formal charges, saying \\"We fear that the haste which has been employed to open the hearings is inspired, not by judicial preoccupations, but motivated by political considerations.\\" In lieu of attending the hearing, they sent letters stating the shortcomings and asked to be discharged as counsel.Naud, p. 249; Baraduc, p. 143; Jaffr√©, p. 263. The court carried on without them. The president of the court, Pierre Mongibeaux, announced the trial had to be completed before the general election scheduled for 21 October.Laval Parle, Notes et M√©moires Rediges par Pierre Laval dans sa cellule, avec une pr√©face de sa fille et de Nombreux Documents In√©dits, Constant Bourquin (Editor), pp. 13‚Äì15. Mongibeaux and Mornet, the public prosecutor, were unable to control constant hostile outbursts from the jury. These occurred as increasingly heated exchanges between Mongibeaux and Laval became louder and louder. On the third day, Laval's three lawyers were with him as the President of the Bar Association had advised them to resume their duties.Le Proc√®s Laval: Compte-rendu st√©nographique, Maurice Gar√ßon (Editor), Paris: Albin Michel, 1946, p. 91. After the adjournment, Mongibeaux announced that the part of the interrogation dealing with the charge of plotting against the security of the state was concluded. To the charge of collaboration Laval replied, \\"Monsieur le Pr√©sident, the insulting way in which you questioned me earlier and the demonstrations in which some members of the jury indulged show me that I may be the victim of a judicial crime. I do not want to be an accomplice; I prefer to remain silent.\\" Mongibeaux called the first of the prosecution witnesses, but they had not expected to testify so soon and none were present. Mongibeaux adjourned the hearing for the second time so that they could be located. When the court reassembled half an hour later, Laval was no longer in his place.Le Proces Laval, pp. 207‚Äì209. Although Pierre-Henri Teitgen, the Minister of Justice in Charles de Gaulle's cabinet, personally appealed to Laval's lawyers to have him attend the hearings, he declined to do so. Teitgen freely confirmed the conduct of Mongibeaux and Mornet, professing he was unable to do anything to curb them. A sentence of death was handed down in Laval's absence. His lawyers were refused a re-trial.Naud, pp. 249‚Äì57; Baraduc, pp. 143‚Äì6; Jaffr√©, pp. 263‚Äì7. The execution was fixed for the morning of 15 October at Fresnes Prison. Laval attempted to cheat the firing squad by taking poison from a vial stitched inside the lining of his jacket. He did not intend, he explained in a suicide note, that French soldiers should become accomplices in a \\"judicial crime\\". The poison, however, was so old that it was ineffective, and repeated stomach-pumpings revived Laval.Warner. pp. 415‚Äì6. For detailed accounts of Laval's execution, see Naud, pp. 276‚Äì84; Baraduc, pp. 188‚Äì200; Jaffr√©, pp. 308‚Äì18. Laval requested that his lawyers witness his execution. He was shot shouting \\"Vive la France!\\" Shouts of \\"Murderers!\\" and \\"Long live Laval!\\" were apparently heard from the prison.Chambrun, Ren√© de, Mission and Betrayal 1949-1945, London: Andr√© Deutch, 1993, p. 134. Laval's widow declared: \\"It is not the French way to try a man without letting him speak\\", she told an English newspaper, \\"That's the way he always fought against ‚Äì the German way.\\"Evening Standard, 16 October 1945 (cover page). His corpse was initially buried in an unmarked grave in the Thiais cemetery, until it was buried in the Chambrun family mausoleum at the Montparnasse Cemetery in November 1945. His daughter, Jos√©e Laval, wrote a letter to Churchill in 1948, suggesting the firing squad who killed her father \\"wore British uniforms\\". The letter was published in the June 1949 issue of Human Events, an American conservative newspaper. The High Court, which functioned until 1949, judged 108 cases; it pronounced eight death penalties, including one for an elderly P√©tain, whose appeal failed. Only three of the death penalties were carried out: Pierre Laval; Fernand de Brinon, Vichy's Ambassador in Paris to the German authorities; and Joseph Darnand, head of the Milice.Curtis, Michael, Verdict on Vichy, New York: Arcade Publishing, 2002, pp. 346‚Äì7.

Public law comprises constitutional law, administrative law, tax law and criminal law, as well as all procedural law. (Laws concerning relationships between individuals belong to private law.) The relationships public law governs are asymmetric and unequal. Government bodies (central or local) can make decisions about the rights of persons. However, as a consequence of the rule-of-law doctrine, authorities may only act within the law (secundum et intra legem). The government must obey the law. For example, a citizen unhappy with a decision of an administrative authority can ask a court for judicial review. Rights, too, can be divided into private rights and public rights. A paragon of a public right is the right to welfare benefits ‚Äì only a natural person can claim such payments, and they are awarded through an administrative decision out of the government budget. The distinction between public law and private law dates back to Roman law, where the Roman jurist Ulpian ( 170 ‚Äì 228) first noted it. It was later adopted to understand the legal systems both of countries that adhere to the civil-law tradition, and of those that adhere to common-law tradition. The borderline between public law and private law is not always clear. Law as a whole cannot neatly be divided into \\"law for the State\\" and \\"law for everyone else\\". As such, the distinction between public and private law is largely functional rather than factual, classifying laws according to which domain the activities, participants, and principle concerns involved best fit into. This has given rise to attempts to establish a theoretical understanding for the basis of public law. History of public law The distinction between public and private law was first made by Roman jurist Ulpian, who argues in the Institutes (in a passage preserved by Justinian in the Digest ) that \\"[p]ublic law is that which respects the establishment of the Roman commonwealth, private that which respects individuals' interests, some matters being of public and others of private interest.\\" Furthermore, he defines public law as the law concerning religious affairs, the priesthood, and offices of the State. Roman law conceived of the law as a series of relationships between persons and persons, persons and things, and persons and the State. Public law consisted of the latter of these three relationships. However, Roman lawyers devoted little attention to this area, and instead focussed largely on areas of private law. It was, however, of great importance in Teutonic society, as noted by German legal historian Otto von Gierke, who defined the Teutons as the fathers of public law. Drawing a line between public and private law largely fell out of favor in the ensuing millennium, though, as Ernst Kantorowicz notes, Medieval saw a concern with the Roman conception of the res publica inherent in the legal fiction of the king's two bodies. However, legal philosophers during this period operated largely theologians who operated within the realm of Canon Law, and were instead concerned with distinctions between divine law, natural law, and human law. The \\"public/private\\" divide in law would not return until the 17th and 18th centuries. Through the emergence of the nation-state and new theories of sovereignty, notions of a distinctly public realm began to crystalize. However, the claims made by monarchs, and later parliaments, to an unrestrained power to make law spurred attempts to establish a distinctly private sphere that would be free from encroaching State power in return. Public law in civil law and common law jurisdictions Traditionally, the division between public and private law has been made in the context of the legal systems found in Continental Europe, whose laws all fall within the tradition of civil law. However, the public/private divide does not apply strictly to civil law systems. Given public law's emphasis on aspects of the State that are true of all systems of government and law, common law legal systems acknowledge, even if they do so unconsciously, that actions which must be prohibited by the State need not necessarily be prohibited for private parties as well. As such, legal scholars commenting on common law systems, such as the United Kingdom and Canada, have made this distinction as well. For many years, public law occupied a marginal position in continental European law. By and large, private law was considered general law. Public law, on the other hand, was considered to consist of exceptions to this general law. It was not until the second half of the Twentieth-century that public law began to play a prominent role in European society through the constitutionalization of private law, as well as the development of administrative law and various functional fields of law, including labor law, medical law, and consumer law. Though this began to blur the distinction between public and private law, it did not erode the former. Instead, it elevated public law from its once marginal state, with an acknowledgment that there are few, if any, areas of the law that are free from potential State intervention. In Italy, for example, the development of public law was considered a project of state- building, following the ideas of Vittorio Emanuele Orlando. Indeed, many early Italian public lawyers were also politicians, including Orlando himself. Now, in countries such as France, public law now refers to the areas of constitutional law, administrative law, and criminal law. Areas of public law = Constitutional law = In modern states, constitutional law lays out the foundations of the state. Above all, it postulates the supremacy of law in the functioning of the state ‚Äì the rule of law. Secondly, it sets out the form of government ‚Äì how its different branches work, how they are elected or appointed, and the division of powers and responsibilities between them. Traditionally, the basic elements of government are the executive, the legislature and the judiciary. And thirdly, in describing what are the basic human rights, which must be protected for every person, and what further civil and political rights citizens have, it sets the fundamental borders to what any government must and must not do. In most jurisdictions, constitutional law is enshrined in a written document, the Constitution, sometimes together with amendments or other constitutional laws. In some countries, however, such a supreme entrenched written document does not exist for historical and political reasons ‚Äì the Constitution of the United Kingdom is an unwritten one. = Administrative law = Administrative law refers to the body of law that regulates bureaucratic managerial procedures and defines the powers of administrative agencies. These laws are enforced by the executive branch of a government rather than the judicial or legislative branches (if they are different in that particular jurisdiction). This body of law regulates international trade, manufacturing, pollution, taxation, and the like. This is sometimes seen as a subcategory of civil law and sometimes seen as public law as it deals with regulation and public institutions = Criminal law = = Tax law = Tax law first became an area of public law during the 17th century, as a consequence of new theories of sovereignty that began to emerge. Until this point, taxes were considered gifts under the law, given to the State by a private donor ‚Äî the taxpayer. It is now considered an area of public law, as it concerns a relationship between persons and the State. Theoretical distinction between private and public law The analytical and historical distinction between public and private law has emerged predominantly in the legal systems of continental Europe. As a result, German- language legal literature has produced extensive discussion on the precise nature of the distinction between public law and private law. Several theories have evolved, which are neither exhaustive nor mutually exclusive or separate. The interest theory of public law emerges from the work of Roman jurist Ulpian, who stated \\"Publicum ius est, quod ad statum rei Romanae spectat, privatum quod ad singulorum utilitatem. (Public law is that, which concerns Roman state, private law is concerned with the interests of citizens.) Charles-Louis Montesquieu elaborates upon this theory in The Spirit of the Laws, published during the 18th century, wherein Montesquieu establishes a distinction between international (right of nations), public (political right), and private (civil right) law according to various actors interests and rights. There, he writes: ‚ÄúConsidered as inhabitants of a planet so large that different peoples are necessary, they have laws bearing on the relation that these peoples have with one another, and this is the . Considered as living in a society that must be maintained, they have laws concerning the relation between those who govern and those who are governed, and this is the . Further, they have laws concerning the relation that alI citizens have with one another, and this is the .‚Äù Criticisms of interest theory include the difficulty in establishing a clear distinction between private and public interest, if such a distinction does exist, and categorizing laws accordingly. The subjection theory focuses on explaining the distinction by emphasizing the subordination of private persons to the state. Public law is supposed to govern this relationship, whereas private law is considered to govern relationships where the parties involved meet on a level playing field. However, some areas commonly considered private law also imply subordination, such as employment law. Moreover, legal proceedings wherein the State is a party may undermine the totality of the State's authority, and the degree to which private persons are subordinate to the State, if a Court finds in favor of a non-State party (see Carpenter v. United States, for example). The subject theory is concerned with the position of the subject of law in the legal relationship in question. If it finds itself in a particular situation as a public person (due to membership in some public body, such as a state or a municipality), public law applies, otherwise it is private law. A combination of the subjection theory and the subject theory arguably provides a workable distinction. Under this approach, a field of law is considered public law where one actor is a public authority endowed with the power to act unilaterally (imperium) and this actor uses that imperium in the particular relationship. In other words, all depends whether the public authority is acting as a public or a private entity, say when ordering office supplies. This latest theory considers public law a special instance. There are areas of law that do not seem to fit into either public or private law, such as employment law ‚Äì parts of it look like private law (the employment contract) while other parts look like public law (the activities of an employment inspectorate when investigating workplace safety). The distinction between public and private law might purely academic, but it also affects legal practice. It has bearing on the delineation between competences of different courts and administrative bodies. Under the Austrian constitution, for example, private law is among the exclusive competences of federal legislation, whereas public law is partly a matter of state legislation.

Biography Kirkwood was educated at Parkhead Public School and was trained as an engineer. Kirkwood's earliest political involvement was through his trade union, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and the Socialist Labour Party, which he left in 1914 to join the Independent Labour Party (ILP). He was recognised as the Scottish engineers' leader for many years. He served on the Glasgow Trade Council and was a member of the Clyde Workers' Committee (CWC), an organisation chaired by William Gallacher. The CWC grew out of the Clyde engineers' pay dispute of 1915. Until its effective suppression in early 1916 it organised shop floor opposition to the policies of the Ministry of Munitions with regard to Leaving Certificates and Dilution of Labour. Kirkwood was the convenor of shop stewards at Parkhead Forge of William Beardmore and Company, where, in January 1916, he helped to secure a dilution agreement. In March 1916, as a result of a strike related to the implementation of the dilution agreement, Kirkwood was arrested and deported from Glasgow to Edinburgh, an event which greatly increased his profile. He returned to Glasgow in 1917, and was employed as foreman at the Mile-End Shell Factory. In January 1919 Kirkwood was prominently associated with the 40 hours' Strike. Batoned and arrested at a riot in George Square, Glasgow, he was tried for incitement to riot and acquitted. In the 1922 General Election Kirkwood was elected to the House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) Dumbarton Burghs. He had previously served for four years on Glasgow Town Council. On the 9th of May, 1924, he and James Maxton were temporarily suspended for causing an uproar in the House, after the defeat of George Buchanan's Scottish Home Rule Bill. Kirkwood was one of the leading figures of the ILP in Parliament as it came into increasing conflict with the Labour Party. In the 1931 general election he was returned as one of five ILP MPs without Labour Party support. However, when the ILP, with the support of James Maxton, decided to disaffiliate from the Labour Party in 1932 this was a step too far for Kirkwood, and he left the ILP to join the new Scottish Socialist Party and again took the Labour Party whip.James Jupp, The Radical Left in Britain: 1931-1941, p.47 Kirkwood published his autobiography, My Life of Revolt in 1935. Kirkwood became a Privy Counsellor in 1948. When his constituency disappeared at the 1950 general election he was elected for the new constituency of East Dunbartonshire. He left the Commons in 1951. Kirkwood was created Baron Kirkwood, of Bearsden in the County of Dunbarton on 22 December 1951. He died on 16 April 1955.

Unlike Wireless Application Protocol, i-mode encompasses a wider variety of internet standards, including web access, e-mail, and the packet-switched network that delivers the data. i-mode users have access to various services such as e-mail, sports results, weather forecast, games, financial services, and ticket booking. Content is provided by specialized services, typically from the mobile carrier, which allows them to have tighter control over billing. Like WAP, i-mode delivers only those services that are specifically converted for the service, or are converted through gateways. Description Evolution of mobile web standards In contrast with the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) standard, which used Wireless Markup Language (WML) on top of a protocol stack for wireless handheld devices, i-mode borrows from DoCoMo proprietary protocols ALP (HTTP) and TLP (TCP, UDP), as well as fixed Internet data formats such as C-HTML, a subset of the HTML language designed by DoCoMo. C-HTML was designed for small devices (e.g. cellular phones) with hardware restrictions such as lower memory, low-power CPUs with limited or no storage capabilities, small monochrome display screens, single-character fonts and limited input methods. As a simpler form of HTML, C-HTML does not support tables, image maps, multiple fonts and styling of fonts, background colors and images, frames, or style sheets, and is limited to a monochromatic display. i-mode phones have a special i-mode button for the user to access the start menu. There are more than 12,000 official sites and around 100,000 or more unofficial i-mode sites, which are not linked to DoCoMo's i-mode portal page and DoCoMo's billing services. NTT DoCoMo supervises the content and operations of all official i-mode sites, most of which are commercial. These official sites are accessed through DoCoMo's i-mode menu but in many cases official sites can also be accessed from mobile phones by typing the URL or through the use of QR code (a barcode). An i-mode user pays for both sent and received data. There are services to avoid unsolicited e-mails. The basic monthly charge is typically on the order of JPY ¬•200 - ¬•300 for i-mode not including the data transfer charges, with additional charges on a monthly subscription basis for premium services. A variety of discount plans exist, for example family discount and flat packet plans for unlimited transfer of data at a fixed monthly charge (on the order of ¬•4,000/month). History i-mode was launched in Japan on 22 February 1999. The content planning and service design team was led by Mari Matsunaga, while Takeshi Natsuno was responsible for the business development. Top executive Keiichi Enoki oversaw the technical and overall development. A few months after DoCoMo launched i-mode in February 1999, DoCoMo's competitors launched very similar mobile data services: KDDI launched EZweb, and J-Phone launched J-Sky. Vodafone later acquired J-Phone including J-Sky, renaming the service Vodafone live!, although initially this was different from Vodafone live! in Europe and other markets. In addition, Vodafone KK was acquired by SoftBank, an operator of Yahoo! Japan in October, 2006 and changed the name to SoftBank Mobile. As of June 2006, the mobile data services I-Mode, EZweb, and J-Sky, had over 80 million subscribers in Japan. Since 2003, i-mode center is called CiRCUS, which consists of 400 NEC NX7000 HP-UX servers and occupies 4,600 m¬≤ floor space in DoCoMo's Kawasaki office. The operation support system is called CARNiVAL, which is hosted in the Sanno Park Tower. i-mode usage in Japan peaked around 2008. On October 29 2019, DoCoMo announced i-mode will end in March 2026. Markets Seeing the tremendous success of i-mode in Japan, many operators in Europe, Asia and Australia sought to license the service through partnership with DoCoMo. Takeshi Natsuno was behind the expansion of i-mode to 17 countries worldwide. Kamel Maamria who was a partner with the Boston Consulting Group and who was supporting Mr. Natsuno is also thought to have had a major role in the expansion of the first Japanese service ever outside Japan. i-mode showed very fast take-up in the various countries where it was launched which led to more operators seeking to launch i-mode in their markets with the footprint reaching a total of 17 markets worldwide. While the i-mode service was an exceptional service which positioned DoCoMo as the global leader in value add services, another key success factor for i-mode was the Japanese smartphone makers who developed state of the art handsets to support i-mode. As i-mode was exported to the rest of the world, Nokia and other major handset vendors who controlled the markets at the time, refused at first to support i-mode by developing handsets which support the i-mode service. The operators who decided to launch i-mode had to rely on Japanese vendors who had no experience in international markets. As i-mode showed success in these markets, some vendors started customizing some of their handsets to support i-mode, however, the support was only partial and came late in time. While the service was successful during the first years after launch, the lack of adequate handsets and the emergence of new handsets from new vendors which supported new Internet services on one hand, and a change of leadership of i-mode in Docomo, lead to a number of operators to migrate or integrate i-mode into new mobile Internet services. These efforts were ultimately unsuccessful, and i-mode never became popular outside of Japan. i-mode was launched in the following countries: * Australia (Telstra) * Belgium (Base) * Bulgaria (Globul) * France (Bouygues T√©l√©com) * Germany (E-Plus) * Greece (Cosmote) * Hong Kong (3) * Israel (Cellcom) * Ireland (O2) * Italy (Wind) * Netherlands (KPN) * Russia (MTS) * Romania (Cosmote Romania) * Singapore (StarHub) * Spain (Telef√≥nica) * Taiwan (FarEasTone) * UK (O2) Devices Some typical features include the \\"clamshell\\" model with large displays (240x320 pixels) and in many models, a display on either side. Additionally the phones have many extra features, e.g. a megapixel digital camera. The displays normally have 65,536 colors but the newest models have as many as 262,144 colors. * FOMA SA800i * LG KE390i * LG L343i * LG L852i (PRADA) * Mitsubishi M342i * Motorola RAZR V3xx with i-mode * Motorola SLVR L7 i-mode * Motorola SLVR L6 i-mode * NEC N22i * NEC N343i * NEC 411i * Nokia N70 i-mode * Nokia N95i * Nokia 6120 classic * Nokia 6124 classic * Samsung S400i * Samsung S500i * Samsung Z320i * Sony Ericsson K550im * Sony Ericsson K610im * Fujitsu F905i (one of the very few Japanese i-mode phones to be sold outside Japan)  See also  * Microbrowser * Information appliance * Smartphone * Japanese mobile phone culture * Mobile game References External links * NTT DoCoMo: i-mode * VisualMusic on I-Mode Cell.Phone * Evolution Of Mobile Phones For The Past 10 Years * Google Category:Mobile web Category:Typefaces and fonts introduced in 1999 Category:NTT Docomo ","title":"I-mode"},{"id":"287868","text":"Mark Peter Sinclair \\"Marc\\" Almond, (born 9 July 1957) is an English singer- songwriter and musician. Almond first began performing and recording in the synthpop/new wave duo Soft Cell. He has also had a diverse career as a solo artist. His collaborations include a duet with Gene Pitney on the 1989 UK number one single \\"Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart\\". Almond's career spanning over four decades has enjoyed critical and commercial acclaim, and he has sold over 30 million records worldwide. He spent a month in a coma after a near-fatal motorcycle accident in 2004 and later became a patron of the brain trauma charity Headway. He was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2018 New Year Honours for services to arts and culture.\\"New Year Honours List 2018\\". Gov.uk, published 2017-12-29. Early life Almond was born in Southport, Lancashire, the son of Sandra Mary Diesen and Peter John Sinclair Almond, a Second Lieutenant in the King's Liverpool Regiment. He was brought up nearby at his grandparents' house in Birkdale with his younger sister, Julia, and as a child suffered from bronchitis and asthma. When he was four, they left their grandparents' house and moved to Starbeck, Harrogate. Two years later they returned to Southport, and then moved to Horsforth, West Yorkshire. At the age of 11, Almond attended Aireborough Grammar School near Leeds, West Yorkshire. He found solace in music, listening to British radio pioneer John Peel. The first album he purchased was the soundtrack of the stage musical Hair and the first single \\"Green Manalishi\\" by Fleetwood Mac. He later became a great fan of Marc Bolan and David Bowie and got a part-time job as a stable boy to fund his musical tastes.Almond, M., Tainted Life ‚Äì the autobiography, Sidgwick and Jackson, 1999, p.24 After his parents' divorce in 1972, he moved with his mother back to Southport where he attended King George V School. He gained two O-Levels in Art and English and was accepted onto a General Art and Design course at Southport College, specialising in Performance Art.Walker, John. (1987) \\"Marc Almond & David Ball ‚Äì Soft Cell: music + art school\\". In Cross-Overs: Art into Pop, Pop into Art. Almond applied to Leeds Polytechnic, where he was interviewed by Jeff Nuttall, also a performance artist, who accepted him on the strength of his performing skills. During his time at art college, he did a series of performance theatre pieces: Zazou, Glamour in Squalor, Twilights and Lowlifes, as well as Andy Warhol inspired mini-movies. Zazou was reviewed by The Yorkshire Evening Post and described as \\"one of the most nihilistic depressing pieces that I have ever had the misfortune to see\\", prompting Almond to later refer to it as a \\"success\\" in his autobiography. He left art college with a 2:1 honours degree. He later credited writer and artist Molly Parkin with discovering him. It was at Leeds Polytechnic that Almond met David Ball, a fellow student; they formed Soft Cell in 1977. As a child, Almond listened to his parents' record collection, which included his mother's \\"Let's Dance\\" by Chris Montez and \\"The Twist\\" by Chubby Checker, as well as his father's collection of jazz, including Dave Brubeck and Eartha Kitt. As an adolescent, Almond listened to Radio Caroline and Radio Luxembourg. He listened at first to progressive music, blues, and rock, and bands such as Free, Jethro Tull, Van der Graaf Generator, The Who, and The Doors. He bought the first ever issue of Sounds because it contained a free poster of Jimmy Page. Almond became a fan of Bolan after hearing him on The John Peel Show, buying the T. Rex single \\"Ride a White Swan\\". From then on, Almond \\"followed everything Marc Bolan did\\" and it was his obsession with Bolan that prompted Almond to adopt the \\"Marc\\" spelling of his name.Sinclair, David (2007) \\"Marc Bolan: the celebration\\", The Times, 17 September 2007. Retrieved 27 July 2010 He discovered the songs of Jacques Brel through Bowie as well as Alex Harvey and Dusty Springfield. Brel became a major influence. Career =1980s= Almond and Dave Ball formed the synthesiser-based duo Soft Cell and signed to the Some Bizzare label. Their hits included \\"Tainted Love\\" (UK No. 1), \\"Bedsitter\\" (UK No. 4), \\"Say Hello, Wave Goodbye\\" (UK No. 3), \\"Torch\\" (UK No. 2), \\"What!\\" (UK No. 3), \\"Soul Inside\\" (UK No. 16), and the club hit \\"Memorabilia\\". Soft Cell's first release was an independent record (funded by Dave Ball's mother) entitled \\"Mutant Moments\\" via Red Rhino Records in 1980. \\"Mutant Moments\\" came to the attention of music entrepreneur Stevo Pearce, who at the time was compiling a \\"futurist\\" chart for the music papers Record Mirror and Sounds which featured young, upcoming and experimental bands of the new wave of electronic sound. He signed the duo to his Some Bizzare label and they enjoyed a string of nine Top 40 hit singles and four Top 20 albums in the UK between 1981 and 1984. They recorded three albums in New York with producer Mike Thorne: Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret, Non Stop Ecstatic Dancing and The Art of Falling Apart. Almond became involved with the New York Underground Art Scene at this time with writer/DJ Anita Sarko, and performed at a number of Art events, as well as meeting many New York Art luminaries, including Andy Warhol. \\"Tainted Love\\", a cover of a Gloria Jones Northern Soul classic, was number one in the UK and in many countries over the world, and was in the Guinness Book of Records for a while as the record that spent the longest time in the Billboard Top 100 chart in the US. It also won the best-single award of 1981 at the first Brit Awards. Soft Cell brought an otherwise obscure Northern Soul classic to mass public attention and their version of the song is, to date, the UK's 59th best- selling single of all time, selling over one million copies in the UK. In 1982, Almond formed Marc and the Mambas as an offshoot project from Soft Cell. Marc and the Mambas was a loose experimental collective that set the template for the artist that Almond would become. The Mambas at various times included Matt Johnson, Steve James Sherlock, Lee Jenkinson, Peter Ashworth, Jim Thirlwell and Anni Hogan, with whom Almond worked later in his solo career. Under the Mambas moniker, Almond recorded two albums, Untitled and the seminal double opus Torment and Toreros. He disbanded the collective when it started to feel too much like a regular band. Soft Cell disbanded in 1984 just before the release of their fourth album, This Last Night in Sodom, but the duo briefly reunited in 2001. Almond's first proper solo album was Vermin in Ermine, released in 1984. Produced by Mike Hedges, it featured musicians from the Mambas outfit, Annie Hogan, Martin McCarrick and Billy McGee. This ensemble, known as The Willing Sinners, worked alongside Almond for the subsequent albums Stories of Johnny (1985) from which the title track became a minor hit, and Mother Fist and Her Five Daughters (1987), also produced by Mike Hedges. The latter album was highly acclaimed in reviews, with Ned Raggett writing that the 'Mother Fist' album \\"embraces classic European cabaret to wonderful effect, more so than any American or English rock album since Bowie's Aladdin Sane or Lou Reed's Berlin.\\" McCarrick left The Willing Sinners in 1987 to join Siouxsie and the Banshees, from which point Hogan and McGee became known as La Magia. Almond signed to EMI and released the album The Stars We Are in 1988. This album featured Almond's version of \\"Something's Gotten Hold of My Heart\\", which was later re-recorded as a duet with the song's original singer Gene Pitney and released as a single. The track reached No. 1 in the UK. It also reached number one in Germany and was a major hit in countries around the world. The Stars We Are became his biggest selling solo album in the USA, and the single \\"Tears Run Rings\\" became his only solo single to peak inside the US Billboard Hot 100. Almond's other recordings in the 1980s included an album of Brel songs, called Jacques, and an album of dark French chansons originally performed by Juliette Gr√©co, Serge Lama and L√©o Ferr√©, as well as poems by Rimbaud and Baudelaire set to music. This album was released in 1993 as Absinthe, and was initially recorded in the late 1980s then finished in Paris in the early 1990s. =1990s= Almond's first release in the 1990s was the album Enchanted, which spawned the UK Top 30 hit \\"A Lover Spurned\\". A further single from the album, \\"Waifs and Strays\\", was remixed by Dave Ball who was now in the electronic dance band The Grid. In 1991, Soft Cell returned to the charts with a new remix of \\"Say Hello Wave Goodbye\\" followed by a re-release of \\"Tainted Love\\" (with a new video). The singles were issued to promote a new Soft Cell/Marc Almond compilation album, Memorabilia - The Singles, which collected some of the biggest hits from Almond's career throughout the previous ten years. The album reached the UK Top 10. Almond then signed to WEA and released a new solo album, Tenement Symphony. Produced partly by Trevor Horn, the album yielded three Top 40 hits including renditions of the Jacques Brel classic \\"Jacky\\" (which made the UK Top 20), and \\"The Days of Pearly Spencer\\" which returned Almond to the UK Top 5 in 1992. Later that year, Almond played a lavish one-off show at the Royal Albert Hall in London, which featured an orchestra and dancers as he performed material from his entire career. The show was recorded and released as the CD and video 12 Years of Tears. In 1993 Almond toured Russia (including Siberia) by invitation of the British consul in Moscow. Accompanied only by Martin Watkins on piano, he played small Soviet halls and theatres, often without amplification, and ended at the \\"mini Bolshoi\\" in Moscow. Transmitted live on television Almond made a plea for tolerance of gay people. The tour was fraught with troubles, which Almond detailed in his autobiography, but it marked the beginning of his love affair with the genre of Russian folk torch songs known as Romance. Almond's next album Fantastic Star saw him part with WEA and sign to Mercury Records. Much of Fantastic Star was originally recorded in New York with Mike Thorne, but later after signing to Mercury, was reworked in London. Almond also recorded a session for the album with John Cale, David Johanson, and Chris Spedding; some made the final cut. Other songs were produced by Mike Hedges and Martyn Ware. Adding to the disjointed recording process was the fact that during recording Almond also spent several weeks attending a treatment centre in Canterbury for addiction to prescription drugs.Almond, M., Tainted Life ‚Äì the autobiography, Sidgwick and Jackson, 1999, p. 389 However, on its release Fantastic Star gave Almond a hit single with \\"Adored and Explored\\", and also minor hits and stage favourites such as \\"The Idol\\" and \\"Child Star\\". Fantastic Star was Almond's last album with a major record label, and the period also marked the ending of his managerial relationship with Stevo Pearce.Almond, M., Tainted Life ‚Äì the autobiography, Sidgwick and Jackson, 1999, p. 409 Almond re-invented himself and signed to Echo records in 1998 with a more downbeat and atmospheric electronica album, Open All Night. This featured R&B; and trip hop influences, as well as torch songs for which he had become known. The album featured a duet (\\"Threat of Love\\") with Siouxsie Sioux as well as one (\\"Almost Diamonds\\") with Kelli Ali (then of the Sneaker Pimps). \\"Black Kiss\\", \\"Tragedy\\" and \\"My Love\\" were the singles from the album Open All Night. =2000s= Almond relocated in 2000 to Moscow where he rented an apartment. With the encouragement and connections of executive producer Misha Kucherenko, he embarked on a three-year recording project of Russian romance and folk songs, called Heart on Snow. Featuring many Russian stars old and new such as Boris Grebenshchikov, Ilya Lagutenko of the Russian band Mumiy Troll, Lyudmila Zykina and Alla Bayanova and featuring The Rossiya Folk Orchestra conducted by Anatole Sobolev, it was the first time that such a project had been undertaken by a Western artist, many of the loved Soviet era songs sung in English for the first time. The album was produced by musician/arranger Andrei Samsonov. Almond performed many times at the famous now demolished Rossiya Concert Hall with Lyudmila Zykina and Alla Bayanova, and with the Rossiya Folk Orchestra. In 2001, Soft Cell reunited briefly and released their first new album in 18 years, Cruelty Without Beauty. Two singles came out of this album, \\"Monoculture\\" and a cover of the Frankie Valli's \\"The Night\\", which led to a Top of the Pops appearance for the band, their first since the mid 1980s. In October 2004, Almond was seriously injured in a motorbike accident near St Paul's Cathedral, London. Near death and in a coma for weeks, he suffered two huge blood clots and had to undergo emergency surgery twice. He also suffered serious head injuries, multiple breaks and fractures, a collapsed lung and damaged hearing. He began a slow recovery determined to get back on the stage and in the studio. In June 2007, Almond released an album of cover songs, Stardom Road. Picked to tell a story of his life and career, the album featured songs as diverse as \\"I Have Lived\\" by Charles Aznavour, to \\"Stardom Road\\" by Third World War, Frank Sinatra's \\"Strangers in the Night\\", and \\"Kitsch\\" by Paul Ryan. The album featured his first new song since the motorbike accident, \\"Redeem me (Beauty Will Redeem the World)\\". Stardom Road was to be one of three albums for the Sanctuary label, the UK's largest independent record label up until 2007 when it got itself into financial difficulty and was sold off in June 2007 to Universal Music Group. In July 2007, Almond celebrated his 50th birthday on stage at the Shepherds Bush Empire in London and in September performed at a tribute show to Marc Bolan, his teenage hero. At the concert he dueted with Bolan's wife, Gloria Jones, on an impromptu version of \\"Tainted Love\\". In October 2007, the fashion house Yves Saint Laurent picked Almond's \\"Strangers in the Night\\" to represent their show at London's Fashion Rocks. Almond performed for the event at the Royal Albert Hall. In 2008 and 2009, Almond toured with Jools Holland throughout the UK as well as guesting at shows by Current 93, Baby Dee and a tribute show to the late folk singer Sandy Denny at the Festival Hall. In October 2009, Almond released his second album of Russian Romances and Gypsy songs in an album titled Orpheus in Exile. The album was a tribute to Russian singer Vadim Kozin, who was exiled to the gulags of the Arctic Circle. The album was produced by Alexei Fedorov and features an orchestra arranged by Anatole Sobolev. =2010s= In June 2010, Almond released Variet√©, his first studio album of self written material since Stranger Things in 2001. The album marks Almond's 30th anniversary as a recording artist, a fact he celebrated with a new concert tour in Autumn 2010. Also in the summer of 2010 Almond was named Mojo Hero, an award given by the music magazine Mojo. The award was presented to Almond by Anohni who flew from New York for the occasion. In 2011, Almond released the Feasting with Panthers album, a collaboration with musician and arranger Michael Cashmore. It featured poetry set to music, including the poems of Count Eric Stenbock, Jean Genet, Jean Cocteau, Paul Verlaine and Rimbaud. Later in the same year Almond took part in a music- theatre work Ten Plagues, held at Edinburgh's Traverse Theatre, as part of the 2011 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, from 1 to 28 August 2011. Ten Plagues is a one-man song cycle based on Daniel Defoe's Journal of the Plague Year (which dates back to 1722), with metaphors of Aids and epidemics. It was written for him by Mark Ravenhill and Conor Mitchell. In 2012, Almond took the role of the Roman Stoic philosopher Seneca in the Paris Th√©√¢tre du Ch√¢telet's experimental rock adaptation of Poppea, based on Monteverdi's original 17th-century opera The Coronation of Poppea. The production also featured ex-Libertines member Carl Bar√¢t, French singer-songwriter Benjamin Biolay, Swedish singer Fredrika Stahl and was directed by ex-Clash drummer Peter Howard. Later that year, on 9 August 2012, Almond performed at Anohni's Meltdown Festival in London's Southbank Centre, reforming Marc and the Mambas to perform their second album Torment and Toreros live for the first time. Anohni has stated that Torment and Toreros was her favourite album throughout her teens and that it became the starting point for Antony and the Johnsons. Anohni joined the band on stage for one song, singing \\"My Little Book of Sorrows\\" with Almond. In 2013, Almond revived Ten Plagues and performed it for a month at Wilton's Music Hall in London. He also performed with Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson on stage performing Tull's concept album \\"Thick as a Brick\\" at The Royal Albert Hall. That year Almond also received The Ivor Novello Inspiration Award which was presented to him by longtime friend and co-Manager Vicki Wickham, and was also awarded the Icon Award from Attitude. Almond released three albums throughout 2014. First was The Tyburn Tree with composer John Harle, a concept album about dark historical London. This was followed by The Dancing Marquis album, made with a number of collaborators including Jarvis Cocker, Carl Bar√¢t and Jools Holland, featuring production from Tony Visconti on some tracks. Finally, Almond released a studio recording of his 2011 show, Ten Plagues - A Song Cycle. 2015 saw the release of The Velvet Trail, an album of original material produced by Chris Braide. Almond is currently working on a song cycle to accompany the filming of a multi media performance of √Ä rebours (translated as Against Nature) by Joris-Karl Huysmans. The score for this project has been written by Othon Mataragas with words from Feasting with Panthers collaborator Jeremy Reed. Reed states that he has written 15 songs for the project commenting that Against Nature is \\"still probably one of the most decadent books ever written\\" and that Almond had always wanted to perform it, stating that \\"now we're both jaded aesthetes we could do it\\". In 2016, Marc Almond signed his first major label deal for 20 years, signing a two-album deal with BMG Rights Management. In 2017, the compilation album Hits and Pieces / The Best of Soft Cell & Marc Almond, debuted at number seven in the UK album chart. In September 2017 the album Shadows & Reflections was released, entering the UK chart at No.14. = 2020s = Almond's next solo album, Chaos and a Dancing Star, also written with Braide, was released January 2020. Ian Anderson both sings and plays flute. Personal life Almond divides his time between London, Moscow, and Barcelona. Almond has stated that he dislikes being pigeon-holed as \\"a 'gay' artist\\", saying that such a label \\"enables people to marginalise your work and reduce its importance, implying that it won't be of any interest to anyone who isn't gay\\".Almond, M., Tainted Life ‚Äì the autobiography, Sidgwick and Jackson, 1999, p122 In his autobiography, Almond describes being invited for initiation into Anton LaVey's Church of Satan, and that \\"not being one to turn down a theatrical moment and a chance to be relegated to the bad book, I immediately said yes.\\" Noise musician Boyd Rice performed the simple ceremony in \\"a small grotto in a wood\\" close to where the Hellfire Club used to meet. Almond states that the ceremony involved \\"no dancing naked, no bonfires, no blood sacrifice\\", but even so \\"every hair on my neck stood on end and sweat broke out on my top lip.\\" Almond later stated in a 2016 interview with Loud and Quiet that the initiation was \\"a theatrical joke that got a bit out of hand\\" and that he is not a Satanist. In response to being appointed OBE at the age of 60, Almond said he is still a \\"little bit\\" anti-establishment, adding however: \\"I can't really be a rebel any more. I think it's time to leave it to younger people.\\" Discography =Solo albums= References External links * Official website Category:1957 births Category:20th-century English singers Category:21st- century English singers Category:Alumni of Leeds Beckett University Category:British synth-pop new wave musicians Category:Echo Records artists Category:English expatriates in Spain Category:English male singer-songwriters Category:English new wave musicians Category:English people of Norwegian descent Category:English pop singers Category:Gay musicians Category:LGBT musicians from England Category:LGBT singers from the United Kingdom Category:LGBT songwriters Category:Living people Category:Male new wave singers Category:Officers of the Order of the British Empire Category:People educated at Aireborough Grammar School Category:People educated at King George V College Category:People from Southport Category:Sire Records artists Category:Synth-pop singers Category:Some Bizzare Records artists Category:Vertigo Records artists Category:Soft Cell members Category:Marc and the Mambas members Category:20th-century male singers Category:21st-century male singers Category:The Immaculate Consumptive members Category:English autobiographers Category:Cherry Red Records artists ","title":"Marc Almond"},{"id":"287870","text":"Statue of George Buchanan, Scottish National Portrait Gallery George Buchanan (; February 1506 ‚Äì 28 September 1582) was a Scottish historian and humanist scholar. According to historian Keith Brown, Buchanan was \\"the most profound intellectual sixteenth century Scotland produced.\\" His ideology of resistance to royal usurpation gained widespread acceptance during the Scottish Reformation. Brown says the ease with which King James VII was deposed in 1689 shows the power of Buchananite ideas.Keith M Brown, \\"Reformation to Union, 1560‚Äì1707,\\" in R.A. Houston and W. W. J. Knox, eds., The New Penguin History of Scotland (2001) pp 182‚Äì275, quote at p 185 The Buchanan Monument in Killearn commemorates his nearby birthplace. Early life =Early upbringing and education in Paris= His father, a Highlander and a younger son of an old family, owned the farm of Moss, in the parish of Killearn, Stirlingshire, but he died young, leaving his widow, five sons, and three daughters in poverty. George's mother, Agnes Heriot, was of the family of the Heriots of Trabroun, East Lothian, of which George Heriot, founder of Heriot's Hospital, was also a member. Buchanan, a native speaker of Scottish Gaelic, is said to have attended Killearn school, but not much is known of his early education. His brother, Patrick Buchanan, was also a scholar. In 1520 he was sent by his uncle, James Heriot, to the University of Paris, where he first came in contact with the two great influences of the age, the Renaissance and the Reformation. There, according to him, he devoted himself to the writing of verses \\"partly by liking, partly by compulsion (that being then the one task prescribed to youth)\\". =Return to Scotland= In 1522 his uncle died, and George Buchanan, who was at that time severely ill, was unable to stay in Paris and returned to Scotland. After recovering from his illness, he joined the French auxiliaries who had been brought over to Scotland by John Stewart, Duke of Albany, and took part in an unsuccessful siege of Wark Castle on the border with England in late 1523. In the following year he entered the University of St Andrews, where he graduated B.A. in 1525. He had gone there mainly to attend the lectures of John Mair on logic; and when Mair moved to Paris, Buchanan followed him in 1526. =Professor and Procurator= In 1528 Buchanan graduated M.A. at Scots College, University of Paris. The next year he was appointed regent, or professor, in the College of Sainte-Barbe, and taught there for over three years. Sainte-Barbe was one of the most prestigious and advanced colleges at that time. George added to that prestige by creating new reforms in teaching Latin. In 1529 he was elected \\"Procurator of the German Nation\\" in the University of Paris, and was re-elected four times in four successive months. He resigned his regentship in 1531, and in 1532 became tutor to Gilbert Kennedy, 3rd Earl of Cassilis, with whom he returned to Scotland early in 1537 having acquired a great reputation for learning. =Theological stance= At this period Buchanan assumed the same attitude toward the Roman Catholic Church as Erasmus: he did not repudiate its doctrines, but considered himself free to criticise its practice. Though he listened to the arguments of the Protestant Reformers, he did not join their ranks until 1553. His first literary production in Scotland, when he was in Lord Cassilis's household in the west country, was the poem Somnium, a satirical attack on the Franciscan friars and the monastic life generally. This assault on the monks was not displeasing to James V, who engaged Buchanan as tutor to one of his natural sons, Lord James Stewart (not the son who was afterwards regent), and encouraged him in a more daring effort. The poems Palinodia and Franciscanus et Fratres remained unpublished for many years, but made the author hated by the Franciscan order. Humanist in exile =Arrest, escape and relocation= In 1539 there was persecution in Scotland of the Lutherans, and Buchanan among others was arrested. Although the King had withheld his protection, Buchanan managed to escape and made his way to London, and then Paris. In Paris, however, he found himself in danger when his main enemy, Cardinal David Beaton, arrived there as ambassador, and on the invitation of Andr√© de Gouveia, he moved to Bordeaux. Gouveia was then principal of the newly founded College of Guienne, and by his influence Buchanan was appointed professor of Latin. During his time there several of his major works, the translations of Medea and Alcestis, and the two dramas, Jephthes (sive Votum) and Baptistes (sive Calumnia), were completed. Buchanan, original engraving by Jacobus Houbraken Michel de Montaigne was Buchanan's pupil at Bordeaux and acted in his tragedies. In the essay Of Presumption he classes Buchanan with Jean d'Aurat, Theodore Beza, Michel de l'H√¥pital, Pierre deMontdor√© and Adrianus Turnebus, as one of the foremost Latin poets of his time. Here also Buchanan formed a lasting friendship with Julius Caesar Scaliger; in later life he won the admiration of Joseph Scaliger, who wrote an epigram on Buchanan which contains the couplet, famous in its day: \\"Imperii fuerat Romani Scotia limes; Romani eloquii Scotia limes erit?\\" Austin Seal and Steve Philp translate this as: 'Just as Scotland was at the apex of the Roman Empire, so Scotland shall be at the apex of Roman eloquence'. (Not only is Buchanan's Latin scholarship extolled, a congratulatory reference to Scotland retaining Scottish law ‚Äì quintessentially an improved version of Roman law ‚Äì as the foundation of its legal system is also implied.) =Return to Paris= In 1542 or 1543 he returned to Paris, and in 1544 he was appointed regent in the Coll√®ge du cardinal Lemoine. Among his colleagues were Muretus and Turnebus. Although little is known about George during this time, we can gather that he probably once again fell ill according to an elegy he wrote to his comrades Tastaeus and Tevius. =Coimbra= In 1547 Buchanan joined the band of French and Portuguese humanists who had been invited by Gouveia to lecture in the Portuguese University of Coimbra. The French mathematician Elie Vinet, and the Portuguese historian, Jer√≥nimo Os√≥rio, were among his colleagues; Gouveia, called by Montaigne le plus grand principal de France, was rector of the university, which had reached the summit of its prosperity under the patronage of King John III. But the rectorship had been coveted by Diogo de Gouveia, uncle of Andr√© and formerly head of Sainte-Barbe. It is probable that before Andr√©'s death at the end of 1547 Diogo had urged the Inquisition to investigate him and his staff; up to 1906, when the records of the trial were first published in full, Buchanan's biographers generally attributed the attack to the influence of Cardinal Beaton, the Franciscans, or the Jesuits, and the whole history of Buchanan's residence in Portugal was extremely obscure. =Trial and imprisonment= George Buchanan, painter unknown A commission of inquiry was appointed in October 1549 and reported in June 1550. Buchanan and two Portuguese, Diogo de Teive and Jo√£o da Costa (who had succeeded to the rectorship), were committed for trial. Teive and Costa were found guilty of various offences against public order, and the evidence shows that there was ample reason for a judicial inquiry. Buchanan was accused of Lutheran and Judaistic practices. He defended himself, admitting that some of the charges were true. About June 1551 he was sentenced to abjure his errors, and to be imprisoned in the monastery of S√£o Bento in Lisbon. Here he listened to edifying discourses from the monks, whom he found \\"not unkind but ignorant\\". In his leisure he began to translate the Psalms into Latin verse, completing the greater part of the work. =Release= After seven months, Buchanan was released on condition that he remain in Lisbon; and on 28 February 1552 this restriction was lifted. Buchanan then sailed for England, but soon made his way to Paris, where in 1553 he was appointed regent in the College of Boncourt. He remained in that post for two years, and then accepted the office of tutor to the son of the Mar√©chal de Brissac. It was almost certainly during this last stay in France, where Protestantism was being repressed under King Henry II and his son Francis II, that Buchanan took the side of Calvinism. Return to Scotland Detail on the Buchanan memorial in Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh =Espousal of Protestantism= In 1560 or 1561 Buchanan returned to Scotland, and by April 1562 was installed as tutor to the young Mary, Queen of Scots, who read Livy with him daily. Although he had remained Catholic throughout his support of the new learning and his strident criticism of the vices of the clergy, he now openly joined the Protestants Reformed Church and in 1566 was appointed principal of St Leonard's College, St Andrews, by the Earl of Moray. Two years before, he had received from the queen the gift of the revenues of Crossraguel Abbey. Though a layman, he was made Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1567. He had sat in the assemblies from 1563. He was the last lay person to be elected Moderator until Alison Elliot in 2004, the first female Moderator. =Tutor and other offices= Buchanan accompanied the Regent Moray to England, and his famous Detectio Mari√¶ Regin√¶‚Äîa scathing exposure of the Queen's relations to Darnley and the circumstances leading up to his death, published London: John Day, [1571]‚Äîwas produced to the commissioners at Westminster. In 1570, after the assassination of Moray, he was appointed one of the preceptors of the young king, and it was through his strict tuition that James VI acquired his scholarship. As the young king's senior tutor, Buchanan subjected James to regular beatings but also instilled in him a lifelong passion for literature and learning.Croft, Pauline (2003). King James. Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan, p.12‚Äì13. Buchanan sought to turn James into a God-fearing, Protestant king who accepted the limitations of monarchy, as outlined in his treatise De Jure Regni apud Scotos.Croft, Pauline (2003). King James. Basingstoke and New York: Palgrave Macmillan, pp.13, 18. While royal tutor he also held other offices: he was for a short time director of chancery, and then became Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland, a post which entitled him to a seat in the parliament. He appears to have continued in this office for some years, at least till 1579. John Geddie was his clerk and servant in this role, and copied some of Buchanan's manuscripts.Sebastiaan Verweij, The Literary Culture of Early Modern Scotland (Oxford, 2017), p. 95. =Final years= His last years were occupied with completion and publication of two of his major works, De Jure Regni apud Scotos (1579) and Rerum Scoticarum Historia (1582). He died in his first floor flat on Kennedy's Close (near the modern Hunter Square) in Edinburgh on Friday 28 September 1582 and was buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard on the following day. The grave was originally marked by a through- stone but this had sunk into the ground by 1701.Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Grampian Society, 1871 Currently, two memorials in Greyfriars each claim to mark his burial: one just north-west of the church and a second, more modest memorial near the eastmost path. The smaller (later) one is correct. Works =Latin scholar= For mastery of the Latin language, Buchanan has seldom been surpassed by any modern writer. His style is not rigidly modelled on that of any classical author, but has a freshness and elasticity of its own. Hugh Trevor-Roper called him \\"by universal consent, the greatest Latin writer, whether in prose or in verse, in sixteenth century Europe\\". He wrote Latin as if it were his mother tongue. Buchanan also had a rich vein of poetical feeling, and much originality of thought. His translations of the Psalms and of the Greek plays are more than mere versions; his two tragedies, Baptistes and Jephthes, enjoyed a European reputation for academic excellence. His Pompae verses were written for performance at the court entertainments of Mary, including the Offering of the Rustic Gods sung during a masque devised by Bastian Pagez for the baptism of King James.Shire, Helena Mennie, Song Dance and Poetry at the Court of James VI, CUP (1969), 56: Buchanan, George, Omnia Opera, vol.2 (1725), pp.399‚Äì405 =Prose works= In addition to these works, Buchanan wrote in prose Chamaeleon, a satire in Scots against Maitland of Lethington, first printed in 1711; a Latin translation of Linacre's Grammar (Paris, 1533); Libellus de Prosodia (Edinburgh, 1640); and Vita ab ipso scripta biennio ante mortem (1608), edited by R. Sibbald (1702). His other poems are Fratres Fraterrimi, Elegiae, Silvae, two sets of verses entitled Hendecasyllabon Liber and Iambon Liber; three books of Epigrammata; a book of miscellaneous verse; De Sphaera (in five books), suggested by the poem De sphaera mundi of Joannes de Sacrobosco, and intended as a defence of the Ptolemaic theory against the new Copernican view. There are two early editions of Buchanan's works: Thomas Ruddiman's. and Pieter Burman's.. =Late works= The first of his important late works was the treatise De Jure Regni apud Scotos, published in 1579. In this famous work, composed in the form of a dialogue, and evidently intended to instil sound political principles into the mind of his pupil, Buchanan lays down the doctrine that the source of all political power is the people, that the king is bound by those conditions under which the supreme power was first committed to his hands, and that it is lawful to resist, even to punish, tyrants. The importance of the work is proved by the persistent efforts of the legislature to suppress it during the century following its publication. It was condemned by act of parliament in 1584, and again in 1664; and in 1683 it was burned by the University of Oxford. The second of his larger works is the History of Scotland, Rerum Scoticarum Historia, completed shortly before his death, and published in 1582. It is remarkable for the power and richness of its style, and of great value for the period personally known to the author, which occupies the greater portion of the book. The earlier part is based, to a considerable extent, on the legendary history of Boece. Buchanan's purpose was to \\"purge\\" the national history \\"of sum Inglis lyis and Scottis vanite\\" (Letter to Randolph). He said that it would \\"content few and displease many\\"; in fact, its matter gave so much offence that a proclamation was issued calling in all copies of it, as well as of the De Jure Regni, that they might be purged of the \\"offensive and extraordinary matters\\" which they contained. =Lasting legacy= Buchanan holds his great and unique place in literature not so much for his own writings as for his strong and lasting influence on subsequent writers. His influence was notable by 1726 when Andrew Millar, a prominent 18th-century bookseller, took over James McEuen's bookshop in London at the sign of 'Buchanan's Head, Temple Bar'. The sign for the shop depicted the face of George Buchanan, a testament to Buchanan's early place and reputation in Scottish letters. Modern publications and influence Polygon Books have published the poet Robert Crawford's selection of Buchanan's verse in Apollos of the North: Selected Poems of George Buchanan and Arthur Johnston () in 2006, the 500th anniversary of Buchanan's birth. In the lead-up to the anniversary Professor Roger Mason of the University of St Andrews has published A Dialogue on the Law of Kingship among the Scots, a critical edition and translation of George Buchanan's 'De Iure Regni apud Scotos Dialogus (). George Buchanan's statue on the Scott Monument Memorials A statue of Buchanan stands on the west-facing side of the Scott Monument on Princes Street, Edinburgh. It was sculpted by John Rhind. A memorial stained glass window stands in the south wall of Greyfriars Kirk. A bust of Buchanan is in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling. A monument was erected by public subscription in 1789 in the place of his birth, Killearn, Stirlingshire.

A flash mob (or flashmob) is a group of people who assemble suddenly in a public place, perform for a brief time, then quickly disperse, often for the purposes of entertainment, satire, and artistic expression. Flash mobs may be organized via telecommunications, social media, or viral emails. The term, coined in 2003, is generally not applied to events and performances organized for the purposes of politics (such as protests), commercial advertisement, publicity stunts that involve public relation firms, or paid professionals. In these cases of a planned purpose for the social activity in question, the term smart mobs is often applied instead. The term \\"flash rob\\" or \\"flash mob robberies\\", a reference to the way flash mobs assemble, has been used to describe a number of robberies and assaults perpetrated suddenly by groups of teenage youth. Bill Wasik, originator of the first flash mobs, and a number of other commentators have questioned or objected to the usage of \\"flash mob\\" to describe criminal acts.Flash mob has also been featured in some Hollywood movie series, such as stepup. History =First flash mob= Flash mobbing was quickly imitated outside of the United States. This picture is of \\"sydmob\\", the first flashmob held in Sydney, Australia The first flash mobs were created in Manhattan in 2003, by Bill Wasik, senior editor of Harper's Magazine. The first attempt was unsuccessful after the targeted retail store was tipped off about the plan for people to gather. Wasik avoided such problems during the first successful flash mob, which occurred on June 17, 2003 at Macy's department store, by sending participants to preliminary staging areas‚Äîin four Manhattan bars‚Äîwhere they received further instructions about the ultimate event and location just before the event began. More than 130 people converged upon the ninth floor rug department of the store, gathering around an expensive rug. Anyone approached by a sales assistant was advised to say that the gatherers lived together in a warehouse on the outskirts of New York, that they were shopping for a \\"love rug\\", and that they made all their purchase decisions as a group.Bedell, Doug. \\"E-mail Communication Facilitates New 'Flash Mob' Phenomenon\\", Knight Ridder Tribune Business News, July 23, (2003) Subsequently, 200 people flooded the lobby and mezzanine of the Hyatt hotel in synchronized applause for about 15 seconds, and a shoe boutique in SoHo was invaded by participants pretending to be tourists on a bus trip. Wasik claimed that he created flash mobs as a social experiment designed to poke fun at hipsters and to highlight the cultural atmosphere of conformity and of wanting to be an insider or part of \\"the next big thing\\". The Vancouver Sun wrote, \\"It may have backfired on him ... [Wasik] may instead have ended up giving conformity a vehicle that allowed it to appear nonconforming.\\" In another interview he said \\"the mobs started as a kind of playful social experiment meant to encourage spontaneity and big gatherings to temporarily take over commercial and public areas simply to show that they could\\". =Precedents and precursors= In 19th-century Tasmania, the term flash mob was used to describe a subculture consisting of female prisoners, based on the term flash language for the jargon that these women used. The 19th-century Australian term flash mob referred to a segment of society, not an event, and showed no other similarities to the modern term flash mob or the events it describes. In 1973, the story \\"Flash Crowd\\" by Larry Niven described a concept similar to flash mobs.Nold, Christian (2003). \\"Legible Mob\\". p. 23. With the invention of popular and very inexpensive teleportation, an argument at a shopping mall‚Äîwhich happens to be covered by a news crew‚Äîquickly swells into a riot. In the story, broadcast coverage attracts the attention of other people, who use the widely available technology of the teleportation booth to swarm first that event‚Äîthus intensifying the riot‚Äîand then other events as they happen. Commenting on the social impact of such mobs, one character (articulating the police view) says, \\"We call them flash crowds, and we watch for them.\\" In related short stories, they are named as a prime location for illegal activities (such as pickpocketing and looting) to take place. Lev Grossman suggests that the story title is a source of the term \\"flash mob\\"Lev Grossman, \\"Lord of the Ringworld: In Praise of Larry Niven\\" Flash mobs began as a form of performance art. While they started as an apolitical act, flash mobs may share superficial similarities to political demonstrations. In the 1960s, groups such as the Yippies used street theatre to expose the public to political issues.Cosmic Trigger III, Robert Anton Wilson, 1995, New Falcon Publications Flash mobs can be seen as a specialized form of smart mob, a term and concept proposed by author Howard Rheingold in his 2002 book Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution. Use of the term The first documented use of the term flash mob as it is understood today was in 2003 in a blog entry posted in the aftermath of Wasik's event. The term was inspired by the earlier term smart mob. Flash mob was added to the 11th edition of the Concise Oxford English Dictionary on July 8, 2004 where it noted it as an \\"unusual and pointless act\\" separating it from other forms of smart mobs such as types of performance, protests, and other gatherings. Also recognized noun derivatives are flash mobber and flash mobbing. Webster's New Millennium Dictionary of English defines flash mob as \\"a group of people who organize on the Internet and then quickly assemble in a public place, do something bizarre, and disperse.\\" This definition is consistent with the original use of the term; however, both news media and promoters have subsequently used the term to refer to any form of smart mob, including political protests; a collaborative Internet denial of service attack; a collaborative supercomputing demonstration; and promotional appearances by pop musicians. The press has also used the term flash mob to refer to a practice in China where groups of shoppers arrange online to meet at a store in order to drive a collective bargain.  Legality  The city of Brunswick, Germany has stopped flash mobs by strictly enforcing the already existing law of requiring a permit to use any public space for an event. In the United Kingdom, a number of flash mobs have been stopped over concerns for public health and safety. The British Transport Police have urged flash mob organizers to \\"refrain from holding such events at railway stations\\". Crime Referred to as flash robs, flash mob robberies, or flash robberies by the media, crimes organized by teenage youth using social media rose to international notoriety beginning in 2011. The National Retail Federation does not classify these crimes as \\"flash mobs\\" but rather \\"multiple offender crimes\\" that utilize \\"flash mob tactics\\". In a report, the NRF noted, \\"multiple offender crimes tend to involve groups or gangs of juveniles who already know each other, which does not earn them the term \\"flash mob\\".\\" Mark Leary, a professor of psychology and neuroscience at Duke University, said that most \\"flash mob thuggery\\" involves crimes of violence that are otherwise ordinary, but are perpetrated suddenly by large, organized groups of people: \\"What social media adds is the ability to recruit such a large group of people, that individuals who would not rob a store or riot on their own feel freer to misbehave without being identified.\\" HuffPost raised the question asking if \\"the media was responsible for stirring things up\\", and added that in some cases the local authorities did not confirm the use of social media making the \\"use of the term flash mob questionable.\\" Amanda Walgrove wrote that criminals involved in such activities don't refer to themselves as \\"flash mobs\\", but that this use of the term is nonetheless appropriate. Dr. Linda Kiltz drew similar parallels between flash robs and the Occupy Movement stating, \\"As the use of social media increases, the potential for more flash mobs that are used for political protest and for criminal purposes is likely to increase.\\".

Mather (Official Number 224850) is a retired Great Lakes bulk freighter now restored as a museum ship in Cleveland, Ohio, one of five in the Great Lakes region. She transported cargo such as ore, coal, stone, and grain to ports throughout the Great Lakes, and was nicknamed \\"The Ship That Built Cleveland\\" because Cleveland's steel mills were a frequent destination. History She was built in 1925 by Great Lakes Engineering Works, Ecorse, Michigan, as the flagship for the Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company and was named in honor of the then-company president, William Gwinn Mather. William G. Mather remained the Cliffs' flagship until Edward B. Greene (now Kaye E. Barker of the Interlake Steamship Company fleet) was built in 1951‚Äì52. She remained an active part of the Cliffs' fleet until the end of the 1980 navigation season. In order to supply the Allied Forces need for steel during World War II, William G. Mather led a convoy of 13 freighters in early 1941 through the ice-choked Upper Great Lakes to Duluth, Minnesota, setting a record for the first arrival in a northern port. This heroic effort was featured on April 28, 1941 issue of Life. She was one of the first commercial Great Lakes vessels to be equipped with radar in 1946. In 1964, she became the very first American vessel to have an automated boiler system, manufactured by Bailey Controls of Cleveland, Ohio. In 1985, Cleveland-Cliffs sold its two remaining operating steamers to Rouge Steel Company, and gradually sold off its idle vessels until only William G. Mather remained, laid up in Toledo, Ohio where she had been since 1980. On December 10, 1987, Cleveland-Cliffs, Inc. donated the steamer William G. Mather to the Great Lakes Historical Society to be restored and preserved as a museum ship and floating maritime museum. After she was brought to Cleveland in October 1988 and funding was acquired from local foundations, corporations, and individuals, restoration began. Fire damage to William G. Mather's galley and after cabin spaces required a major restoration effort. All over the vessel, most of the work was supplied by volunteers who repaired, cleaned, chipped, painted, and polished brass in order to restore William G. Mather's former elegance. In October 1990, she was moved to her permanent berth at the East Ninth Street Pier on Cleveland's North Coast Harbor. In September 1994 the Great Lakes Historical Society divested itself of the museum. Due, in large part, to a groundswell of local support to keep the Mather in Cleveland, the Harbor Heritage Society was created to negotiate a new lease agreement with the city. Incorporated in June 1995, Harbor Heritage formally acquired William G. Mather on July 22, 1995, and in 1996 continued to oversee William G. Mather's ongoing restoration, promotion, and development as a historic vessel. After 10 years of negotiations, the City Of Cleveland, represented by Mayor Jane L. Campbell signed a 40-year lease on June 15, 2003, allowing William G. Mather to stay at its East 9th Street berth. On July 30, 1995 the Steamship William G. Mather was dedicated as an American Society of Mechanical Engineers National Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark for her 1954 installation of a single marine boiler and steam turbine engine, her 1964 installation of the Bailey 760 Boiler Control System and American Shipbuilding AmThrust dual propeller bow thruster‚Äîall firsts for U.S.-Flag Great Lakes vessels. She had a sister ship of the same class, Joseph H. Frantz, but was later converted to diesel, and was scrapped in 2005 after 80 years of continuous use. Image:William G Mather.jpgA front view of the maritime museum Image:Mather Room 1.jpgInterior view of cabin aboard William G. Mather Maritime Museum Current location On September 24, 2005, the museum was moved from the East Ninth Street Pier to Dock 32, just west of the East Ninth Street Pier, closer to the Great Lakes Science Center and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. In October 2006, William G. Mather was acquired by the Great Lakes Science Center. Today, the ship is a focal point for interpreting the relationship between technology, history, commerce, and the environment. See also *SS William G. Mather (1905) *Col. James M.

Many commentators consider the terms to be used in an attempt to de-legitimize Israel by emphasizing Zionism, the Jewish national movement which led to Israel's founding. Meaning and intent The term is described as a means of expressing hostility towards Israel, refusing to acknowledge its existence, and denying its legitimacy or right to exist. Virginia Q. Tilley argues that the term implies condemnation of the idea of a Jewish state, but not necessarily of a Jewish presence. Matthew Gray writes that the term denies Israel the status of a \\"state\\", and emphasizes Israel's Zionist philosophy. Its use by Arab state media and leaders, even though other terms are equally \\"politically useful\\", \\"reinforces the state's anti-Israel posture and the perception of Israel as a sinister threat\\". Describing it as \\"derogatory, indirect language\\", Darrell Jodock states its intent is to \\"deny Israel any place in the family of nations\\". Referring to it as a \\"common epithet\\", Eric Sundquist indicates that it \\"echoed the Arab view, repeated in the core doctrine of the PLO, that Israel was no state at all but an illegal colonialist excrescence\\". Use =In the media= Before 1967, \\"Zionist entity\\" was the standard term used by Arabs and the Arab media to refer to Israel, and was particularly popular in official broadcasts of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan during the 1960s and '70s. The use of this term has persisted since then in Egyptian newspapers, the state-controlled press of Syria, Lebanon's Al-Manar, and the Jordanian media. It is also the only term for Israel used on Radio M√©diterran√©e, a French radio station with a daily audience of around 600,000 \\"mainly French people of Arab descent\\". =Political= The phrase \\"Zionist entity\\" is used by some Arab states, and by \\"politicians and intellectuals throughout the Arab world\\". Lutz Edzard describes it as \\"the traditional Arabic political term for Israel\\", stating it is used in Arabic (particularly Iraqi) international documents. Describing its use in Jordan, Joseph Nevo includes it as part of \\"Arab rhetoric and its traditional reluctance to use the term 'Israel'\\". Middle East journalist Barbara Victor writes that when she went to Tripoli in 1986 to interview Muammar Gaddafi, it was illegal to use any term except \\"Zionist entity\\" to refer to Israel. It has been used regularly at the United Nations, by (among others) Libya, Syria, Iraq, Yemen, and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. It is also used by Iran, and by groups such as Hezbollah, al-Quds Brigades, Hamas, Islamic Jihad, the Palestinian Authority, and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). Use by the latter became \\"less prominent\\" in the late 1980s after the Camp David Accords and PLO recognition of Israel, but has since become common again.

Buchanan was born in Glasgow, Scotland. A committed socialist, he joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP). Buchanan was Vice-Chairman of Glasgow Trades Council and sat on the City Council from 1919 to 1923. At the 1922 general election, he was elected to the House of Commons as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Glasgow Gorbals. In 1932, Buchanan became Chairman of the United Patternmakers Association of Great Britain, which he held for 16 years. He initially agreed with James Maxton's moving the ILP out of the mainstream Labour Party but decided to leave it to rejoin Labour in 1939. At the 1945 general election, Buchanan retained the seat of Glasgow Gorbals and attained the largest increase in percentage of voters in recorded UK history.See United Kingdom general election records#Largest increase in percentage share of vote After the election, the new prime minister, Clement Attlee, appointed Buchanan as Under- Secretary of State for Scotland. Buchanan also later served as Minister of Pensions. Buchanan resigned from Parliament in 1948 to take up the position of Chairman of the National Assistance Board and was succeeded by Alice Cullen, who had already succeeded him as the candidate for Glasgow Gorbals. He died in 1955, at 64.

The respiratory tract is lined with respiratory mucosa or respiratory epithelium. Air is breathed in through the nose to the nasal cavity, where a layer of nasal mucosa acts as a filter and traps pollutants and other harmful substances found in the air. Next, air moves into the pharynx, a passage that contains the intersection between the oesophagus and the larynx. The opening of the larynx has a special flap of cartilage, the epiglottis, that opens to allow air to pass through but closes to prevent food from moving into the airway. From the larynx, air moves into the trachea and down to the intersection known as the carina that branches to form the right and left primary (main) bronchi. Each of these bronchi branches into a secondary (lobar) bronchus that branches into tertiary (segmental) bronchi, that branch into smaller airways called bronchioles that eventually connect with tiny specialized structures called alveoli that function in gas exchange. The lungs which are located in the thoracic cavity, are protected from physical damage by the rib cage. At the base of the lungs is a sheet of skeletal muscle called the diaphragm. The diaphragm separates the lungs from the stomach and intestines. The diaphragm is also the main muscle of respiration involved in breathing, and is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system. The lungs are encased in a serous membrane that folds in on itself to form the pleurae ‚Äì a two-layered protective barrier. The inner visceral pleura covers the surface of the lungs, and the outer parietal pleura is attached to the inner surface of the thoracic cavity. The pleurae enclose a cavity called the pleural cavity that contains pleural fluid. This fluid is used to decrease the amount of friction that lungs experience during breathing. Structure Complete respiratory system The respiratory tract is divided into the upper airways and lower airways. The upper airways or upper respiratory tract includes the nose and nasal passages, paranasal sinuses, the pharynx, and the portion of the larynx above the vocal folds (cords). The lower airways or lower respiratory tract includes the portion of the larynx below the vocal folds, trachea, bronchi and bronchioles. The lungs can be included in the lower respiratory tract or as separate entity and include the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. The respiratory tract can also be divided into a conducting zone and a respiratory zone, based on the distinction of transporting gases or exchanging them. The conducting zone includes structures outside of the lungs ‚Äì the nose, pharynx, larynx, and trachea, and structures inside the lungs ‚Äì the bronchi, bronchioles, and terminal bronchioles. The conduction zone conducts air breathed in that is filtered, warmed, and moistened, into the lungs. It represents the 1st through the 16th division of the respiratory tract. The conducting zone is most of the respiratory tract that conducts gases into and out of the lungs, but excludes the respiratory zone that exchanges gases. The conducting zone also functions to offer a low resistance pathway for airflow. It provides a major defense role in its filtering abilities. The respiratory zone includes the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and alveoli, and is the site of oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange with the blood. The respiratory bronchioles and the alveolar ducts are responsible for 10% of the gas exchange. The alveoli are responsible for the other 90%. The respiratory zone represents the 16th through the 23rd division of the respiratory tract. From the bronchi, the dividing tubes become progressively smaller with an estimated 20 to 23 divisions before ending at an alveolus . =Upper respiratory tract= Details of upper respiratory tract. The upper respiratory tract, can refer to the parts of the respiratory system lying above the sternal angle (outside of the thorax), above the vocal folds, or above the cricoid cartilage. The larynx is sometimes included in both the upper and lower airways. The larynx is also called the voice box and has the associated cartilage that produces sound. The tract consists of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, the pharynx (nasopharynx, oropharynx and laryngopharynx) and sometimes includes the larynx. =Lower respiratory tract= Parts of the lower respiratory tract. The lower respiratory tract or lower airway is derived from the developing foregut and consists of the trachea, bronchi (primary, secondary and tertiary), bronchioles (including terminal and respiratory), and lungs (including alveoli). It also sometimes includes the larynx. The lower respiratory tract is also called the respiratory tree or tracheobronchial tree, to describe the branching structure of airways supplying air to the lungs, and includes the trachea, bronchi and bronchioles. * trachea ** main bronchus (diameter approximately 1 ‚Äì 1.4 cm in adults)Page 81 in *** lobar bronchus (diameter approximately 1 cm) **** segmental bronchus (diameter 4.5 to 13 mm) ***** subsegmental bronchus (diameter 1 to 6 mm) ****** conducting bronchiole ******* terminal bronchiole ******** respiratory bronchiole ********* alveolar duct ********** alveolar sac *********** alveolus At each division point or generation, one airway branches into two or more smaller airways. The human respiratory tree may consist on average of 23 generations, while the respiratory tree of the mouse has up to 13 generations. Proximal divisions (those closest to the top of the tree, such as the bronchi) mainly function to transmit air to the lower airways. Later divisions including the respiratory bronchiole, alveolar ducts and alveoli, are specialized for gas exchange. The trachea is the largest tube in the respiratory tract and consists of tracheal rings of hyaline cartilage. It branches off into two bronchial tubes, a left and a right main bronchus. The bronchi branch off into smaller sections inside the lungs, called bronchioles. These bronchioles give rise to the air sacs in the lungs called the alveoli. The lungs are the largest organs in the lower respiratory tract. The lungs are suspended within the pleural cavity of the thorax. The pleurae are two thin membranes, one cell layer thick, which surround the lungs. The inner (visceral pleura) covers the lungs and the outer (parietal pleura) lines the inner surface of the chest wall. This membrane secretes a small amount of fluid, allowing the lungs to move freely within the pleural cavity while expanding and contracting during breathing. The lungs are divided into different lobes. The right lung is larger in size than the left, because of the heart's being situated to the left of the midline. The right lung has three lobes ‚Äì upper, middle, and lower (or superior, middle and inferior), and the left lung has two ‚Äì upper and lower (or superior and inferior), plus a small tongue-shaped portion of the upper lobe known as the lingula. Each lobe is further divided up into segments called bronchopulmonary segments. Each lung has a costal surface, which is adjacent to the ribcage; a diaphragmatic surface, which faces downward toward the diaphragm; and a mediastinal surface, which faces toward the center of the chest, and lies against the heart, great vessels, and the carina where the two mainstem bronchi branch off from the base of the trachea. The alveoli are tiny air sacs in the lungs where gas exchange takes place. The mean number of alveoli in a human lung is 480 million. When the diaphragm contracts, a negative pressure is generated in the thorax and air rushes in to fill the cavity. When that happens, these sacs fill with air, making the lung expand. The alveoli are rich with capillaries, called alveolor capillaries. Here the red blood cells absorb oxygen from the air and then carry it back in the form of oxyhaemaglobin, to nourish the cells. The red blood cells also carry carbon dioxide () away from the cells in the form of carbaminohemoglobin and releases it into the alveoli through the alveolor capillaries. When the diaphragm relaxes, a positive pressure is generated in the thorax and air rushes out of the alveoli expelling the carbon dioxide. =Microanatomy= Respiratory epithelium The respiratory tract is covered in epithelium, which varies down the tract. There are glands and mucus produced by goblet cells in parts, as well as smooth muscle, elastin or cartilage. Most of the epithelium (from the nose to the bronchi) is covered in ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium, commonly called respiratory epithelium. The cilia beat in one direction, moving mucus towards the throat where it is swallowed. Moving down the bronchioles, the cells get more cuboidal in shape but are still ciliated. Glands are abundant in the upper respiratory tract, but there are fewer lower down and they are absent starting at the bronchioles. The same goes for goblet cells, although there are scattered ones in the first bronchioles. Cartilage is present until the small bronchi. In the trachea they are C-shaped rings of hyaline cartilage, whereas in the bronchi the cartilage takes the form of interspersed plates. Smooth muscle starts in the trachea, where it joins the C-shaped rings of cartilage. It continues down the bronchi and bronchioles, which it completely encircles. Instead of hard cartilage, the bronchi and bronchioles are composed of elastic tissue. The lungs are made up of thirteen different kinds of cells, eleven types of epithelial cell and two types of mesenchymal cell. The epithelial cells form the lining of the tracheal, and bronchial tubes, while the mesenchymal cells line the lungs. Respiratory Tract Histological Differences.pngDifferences in cells along the respiratory tract. File:Gray964.png  Transverse section of tracheal tissue. Note that image is incorrectly labeled \\"ciliated stratified epithelium\\" at upper right. Function Most of the respiratory tract exists merely as a piping system for air to travel in the lungs, and alveoli are the only part of the lung that exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide with the blood. =Respiration= Respiration is the rhythmical process of breathing, in which air is drawn into the alveoli of the lungs via inhalation and subsequently expelled via exhalation. When a human being inhales, air travels down the trachea, through the bronchial tubes, and into the lungs. The entire tract is protected by the rib cage, spine, and sternum. In the lungs, oxygen from the inhaled air is transferred into the blood and circulated throughout the body. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is transferred from returning blood back into gaseous form in the lungs and exhaled through the lower respiratory tract and then the upper, to complete the process of breathing. Unlike the trachea and bronchi, the upper airway is a collapsible, compliant tube. As such, it has to be able to withstand suction pressures generated by the rhythmic contraction of the diaphragm that sucks air into the lungs. This is accomplished by the rhythmic contraction of upper airway muscles, such as the genioglossus (tongue) and the hyoid muscles. In addition to rhythmic innervation from the respiratory center in the medulla oblongata, the motor neurons controlling the muscles also receive tonic innervation that sets a baseline level of stiffness and size. The diaphragm is the primary muscle that allows for lung expansion and contraction. Smaller muscles between the ribs, the external intercostals, assist with this process. =Defences against infection= The epithelial lining of the upper respiratory tract is interspersed with goblet cells that secrete a protective mucus. This helps to filter waste, which is eventually either swallowed into the highly acidic stomach environment or expelled via spitting. The epithelium lining the respiratory tract is covered in small hairs called cilia. These beat rhythmically out from the lungs, moving secreted mucus foreign particles toward the laryngopharynx upwards and outwards, in a process called mucociliary clearance, they prevent mucus accumulation in the lungs. Macrophages in the alveoli are part of the immune system which engulf and digest any inhaled harmful agents. Hair in the nostrils plays a protective role, trapping particulate matter such as dust. The cough reflex expels all irritants within the mucous membrane to the outside. The airways of the lungs contain rings of muscle. When the passageways are irritated by some allergen, these muscles can constrict. Clinical significance The respiratory tract is a common site for infections. = Infection = Upper respiratory infection Upper respiratory tract infections are probably the most common infections in the world. The respiratory system is very prone to developing infections in the lungs. Infants and older adults are more likely to develop infections in their lungs, because their lungs are not as strong in fighting off these infections. Most of these infections used to be fatal, but with new research and medicine, they are now treatable. With bacterial infections, antibiotics are prescribed, while viral infections are harder to treat, but still curable. The common cold, and flu are the most common causes of an upper respiratory tract infection, which can cause more serious illness that can develop in the lower respiratory tract. Lower respiratory tract infections Pneumonia is the most common, and frequent lower respiratory tract infection. This can be either viral, bacterial, or fungal. This infection is very common, because pneumonia can be airborne, and when you inhale this infection in the air, the particles enter the lungs and move into the air sacs. This infection quickly develops in the lower part of the lung, and fills the lung with fluid, and excess mucus. This causes difficulty in breathing, and coughing as the lower respiratory tract tries to get rid of the fluid in the lungs. You can be more prone to developing this infection if you have asthma, flu, heart disease, or cancer Bronchitis is another common infection that takes place in the lower respiratory tract. It is an inflammation of the bronchial tubes. There are two forms of this infection: acute bronchitis, which is treatable and can go away without treatment, or chronic bronchitis, which comes and goes, but will always affect one's lungs. Bronchitis increases the amount of mucus that is natural in your respiratory tract. Chronic bronchitis is common in smokers, because the tar from smoking accumulates over time, causing the lungs to work harder to repair themselves. Tuberculosis is one of many other infections that occurs in the lower respiratory tract. You can contract this infection from airborne droplets, and if inhaled you are at risk of this disease. This is a bacterial infection which deteriorates the lung tissue resulting in coughing up blood. This infection is deadly if not treated. =Cancer= 3D still showing increased mucus. Some of these cancers have environmental causes such as smoking. When a tobacco product is inhaled, the smoke paralyzes the cilia, causing mucus to enter the lungs. Frequent smoking, over time causes the cilia hairs to die and can no longer filter mucus. Tar from the smoke inhaled enters the lungs, turning the pink-coloured lungs black. The accumulation of this tar could eventually lead to lung cancer, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. = COPD = Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common lower respiratory disease that can be caused by exposure to harmful chemicals, or prolonged use of tobacco. This disease is chronic and progressive, the damage to the lungs is irreversible and eventually fatal. COPD destroys the alveoli, and lung tissue which makes breathing very difficult, causing shortness of breath, hyperventilation, and raised chest. The decreased number of alveoli causes loss of oxygen supply to the lungs, and an increased accumulation of carbon dioxide. There are two types of COPD: primary and secondary. Primary COPD can be found in younger adults. This type of COPD deteriorates the air sacs, and lung mass. Secondary COPD can be found in older adults who smoke or have smoked and have a history of bronchitis. COPD includes symptoms of emphysema and chronic bronchitis. = Asthma = 3D still showing constricted airways. The bronchi are the main passages to the right and left lungs. These airways carry the oxygen to the bronchioles inside the lungs. Inflammation of the bronchii and bronchioles can cause them to swell up, which could lead to an asthma attack. This results in wheezing, tightness of the chest and severe difficulty in breathing. There are different types of asthma that affect the functions of the bronchial tubes. Allergies can also set off an allergic reaction, causing swelling of the bronchial tubes; as a result, the air passage will swell up, or close up completely. =Mouth breathing= In general, air is inhaled through the nose. It can be inhaled through the mouth if it is not possible to breathe through the nose. However, chronic mouth breathing can cause a dry mouth and lead to infections.

Born in Copenhagen, Denmark, he was the youngest son of Sir Andrew Buchanan, 1st Baronet, diplomat and Frances, daughter of Very Rev Edward Mellish by Elizabeth Leigh. Diplomatic career Buchanan entered diplomatic service in 1876, and served as Second Secretary in Tokyo, Vienna and Bern, and as Secretary in Rome. By 1899 he was serving on the Venezuelan Boundary Commission, and later that year he was appointed Charg√© d'affaires at Darmstadt and Karlsruhe. In late 1901 he moved to Berlin, where he was appointed First Secretary at the British embassy. From 1903 to 1908 he was Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Bulgaria, and in 1909 he was appointed as Minister to the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Invested with the Knight's Grand Cross of Royal Victorian Order in 1909, he was next sworn to the Privy Council. In 1910 Buchanan was appointed as the British Ambassador to Russia. He kept abreast of the political developments in Russia and met some of the leading liberal reformists in the country. When the Dardanelles were guaranteed by Germany to the Turks, Italy sent two secret documents via the British diplomatic corps from Sir Michael Rodd to Sir George at St Petersburg. In it was the evidence that Russia needed to persuade Italy to support her Serbian policy in the Balkans. On 4 March 1915 Imperiali, the Italian envoy to London presented the documents to Sir Edward Grey on an authority of 16 February from Sonnino, their foreign minister. France attached great importance to Italy's decision to join the allies. Buchanan was able to bring Count Sazonov to the negotiating table. It has been suggested that this was secretly encouraged by the then Liberal government in London: Buchanan had developed a strong bond with the Tsar, Nicholas II, and attempted to convince him that granting some constitutional reform would stave off revolution. Buchanan actively supported the Duma in its efforts to change Russia's stately system during war-time. Nicholas's opinion of him was under the Tsarina's sway. Knowing that there were plots to stage a palace coup to replace him, Sir George formally requested an audience with the Tsar in the troubled early days of 1917. At his last meeting with Nicholas he pleaded with him in 'undiplomatic' language: \\"I can but plead as my excuse the fact that I have throughout been inspired by my feelings of devotion for Your Majesty and the Empress. If I were to see a friend walking through a wood on a dark night along a path which I knew ended in a precipice, would it not be my duty, sir, to warn him of his danger? And is it not equally my duty to warn Your Majesty of the abyss that lies ahead of you? You have, sir, come to the parting of the ways, and you have now to choose between two paths. The one will lead you to victory and a glorious peace ‚Äì the other to revolution and disaster. Let me implore Your Majesty to choose the former.\\"G Buchanan, 12 January 1917 ‚Äì page 49, Vol.II autobiography Although the Tsar was touched by the Ambassador's devotion, he allowed his wife's malevolent attitudes to outweigh the sensible advice he had been given. After the collapse of the Autocracy (see Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia), he developed close relations with the liberal Provisional Government led initially by George Lvov and later by Alexander Kerensky that was formed after the February Revolution. At the same time, Buchanan developed a fear of the dangers of Bolshevism and its growing support; he feared the Russian Provisional Government would be toppled and tried to warn of the fragility of the Government and the dangers of a Bolshevik revolution. Buchanan had reported to London: \\"They are more active and better organized than any other group, and until they and the ideas which they represent are finally squashed, the country will remain a prey to anarchy and disorder. If the Government are not strong enough to put down the Bolsheviks by force, at the risk of breaking altogether with the soviet, the only alternative will be a Bolshevik Government.\\"http://spartacus- educational.com/RUSbuchanan.htm \\"However, Buchanan feared the growing support for the Bolsheviks: The Bolsheviks, who form a...\\" However, after the events of the October Revolution and the Bolsheviks ascension to power he was widely criticized for failing to ensure that the Tsar Nicholas II and his family were evacuated from Russia before their execution by the Bolsheviks at Ekaterinburg in 1918. It is now known that this was not his fault but that of the Tsar's first cousin, King George V who, fearful of revolutionary trends in Britain and the stability of his own throne, persuaded the Lloyd George government to rescind the offer they had made to provide sanctuary for the Imperial Family.F.O 371/2995, Buchanan to Foreign Office, 13 March 1917; Hughes, p.85-90. Buchanan was disappointed that the fledgling democracy offered by the Provisional Government was strangled by the Bolshevik coup. At the beginning of December 1918, Buchanan fell ill and for the good of his health he agreed that it was best he left Russia. The family left St Petersburg on 26 December 1918, arriving back in Leith in Scotland on 17 January 1919.Rappaport. Page 324. His health collapsed soon after, forcing him to spend time recovering in Cornwall. After his recovery, he was disappointed that after all his years of service he was not given a peerage and only offered a two-year ambassadorship in Rome. He accepted the post, serving as ambassador to the Kingdom of Italy from 1919‚Äì21. While in Italy his wife was found to have terminal cancer; she died in April 1921 soon after the family's return to England.Rappaport. Page 324. Sir George's autobiography, My Mission to Russia and Other Diplomatic Memories, was published in 1923. It is believed that he had to leave out some of what he knew under threat of losing his pension. He died in 1924.

The potential of such gloves to do this is commonly overstated or totally misunderstood, because sign languages have a complex grammar that includes use of the sign space and facial expressions (non-manual features). The wearable device contains sensors that run along the four fingers and thumb to identify each word, phrase or letter as it is made in American Sign Language. Those signals are then sent wirelessly to a smartphone, which translates them into spoken words at a rate of one word per second. Scientists at UCLA, where the project was developed, believe the innovation could allow for easier communication for deaf people. \\"Our hope is that this opens up an easy way for people who use sign language to communicate directly with non-signers without needing someone else to translate for them,\\" said lead researcher Jun Chen. The researchers also added adhesive sensors to the faces of people used to test the device -- between their eyebrows and on one side of their mouths -- to capture facial expressions that are a part of American Sign Language.

The term is ultimately derived from the style of many early personal computers and dedicated word processors, which were usually beige or similar colors like off white or ecru. These colors were presumably chosen to allow the machines to blend inconspicuously into a variety of settings, especially among similarly colored cubicles and office equipment. IBM's early desktop computers (e.g. IBM Personal Computer, IBM PC/AT) were not only beige, but were distinctly box- shaped, and most manufacturers of clones followed suit. As IBM and its imitators came to dominate the industry, these features became unquestioned standards of desktop computer design.

It was developed by the Soviet inventor and science-fiction author Genrich Altshuller (1926-1998) and his colleagues, beginning in 1946. In English the name is typically rendered as \\"the theory of inventive problem solving\\", and occasionally goes by the English acronym TIPS. Following Altshuller's insight, the theory developed on a foundation of extensive research covering hundreds of thousands of inventions across many different fields to produce a theory which defines generalisable patterns in the nature of inventive solutions and the distinguishing characteristics of the problems that these inventions have overcome. An important part of the theory has been devoted to revealing patterns of evolution and one of the objectives which has been pursued by leading practitioners of TRIZ has been the development of an algorithmic approach to the invention of new systems, and to the refinement of existing ones. TRIZ includes a practical methodology, tool sets, a knowledge base, and model-based technology for generating innovative solutions for problem solving. It is useful for problem formulation, system analysis, failure analysis, and patterns of system evolution. There is a general similarity of purposes and methods with the field of pattern language, a cross discipline practice for explicitly describing and sharing holistic patterns of design. The research has produced three primary findings: # problems and solutions are repeated across industries and sciences # patterns of technical evolution are also repeated across industries and sciences # the innovations used scientific effects outside the field in which they were developed TRIZ practitioners apply all these findings in order to create and to improve products, services, and systems.  History  TRIZ in its classical form was developed by the Soviet inventor and science fiction writer Genrich Altshuller and his associates. He started developing TRIZ in 1946 while working in the \\"Inventions Inspection\\" department of the Caspian Sea flotilla of the Soviet Navy. His job was to help with the initiation of invention proposals, to rectify and document them, and to prepare applications to the patent office. During this time he realised that a problem requires an inventive solution if there is an unresolved contradiction in the sense that improving one parameter impacts negatively on another. He later called these \\"technical contradictions\\". His work on what later resulted in TRIZ was interrupted in 1950 by his arrest and sentencing to 25 years in the Vorkuta Gulag labor camps. The arrest was partially triggered by letters which he and Raphael Shapiro sent to Stalin, ministers and newspapers about certain decisions made by the Soviet Government, which they believed were erroneous. Altshuller and Shapiro were freed during the Khrushchev Thaw following Stalin's death in 1953 and returned to Baku. The first paper on TRIZ titled \\"On the psychology of inventive creation\\" was published in 1956 in \\"Issues in Psychology\\" (Voprosi Psichologii) journal. By 1969, Altshuller had reviewed about 40,000 patent abstracts in order to find out in what way the innovation had taken place and developed the concept of technical contradictions, the concept of ideality of a system, contradiction matrix, and 40 principles of invention. In the years that followed he developed the concepts of physical contradictions, SuField analysis (structural substance-field analysis), standard solutions, several laws of technical systems evolution, and numerous other theoretical and practical approaches. Altshuller also observed clever and creative people at work: he uncovered patterns in their thinking, and developed thinking tools and techniques to model this \\"talented thinking\\". These tools include Smart Little People[reference to p 110] Altshuller, G.S. (1984) Creativity as an Exact Science: the Theory of the Solution of Inventive Problems Translated by Williams, A. Gordon and Breach Science Publishers Inc] and Thinking in Time and Scale (or the Screens of Talented Thought).[reference to p 121] Altshuller, G.S. (1984) Creativity as an Exact Science: the Theory of the Solution of Inventive Problems Translated by Williams, A. Gordon and Breach Science Publishers Inc] In 1971 Altshuller convinced The Inventors Society to establish in Baku the first TRIZ teaching facility, called the Azerbaijan Public Institute for Inventive Creation and the first TRIZ research lab called The Public Lab for Inventive Creation. Altshuller was appointed the head of the lab by the society. The lab incubated the TRIZ movement and in the years that followed other TRIZ teaching institutes were established in all major cities of the USSR. From 1986 Altshuller switched his attention away from technical TRIZ, and started investigating the development of individual creativity. He also developed a version of TRIZ for children, which was trialled in various schools. In 1989 the TRIZ Association was formed, with Altshuller chosen as President. Following the end of the Cold War, the waves of emigrants from the former Soviet Union brought TRIZ to other countries and drew attention to it overseas. In 1995 the Altshuller Institute for TRIZ Studies was established in Boston, USA. In 1998, Oxford Creativity was launched by Karen Gadd, using a new teaching and learning style designed to make TRIZ tools and principles more accessible for everyone known as Oxford TRIZ, which was trademarked in 2013.  Basic principles  TRIZ presents a systematic approach for understanding and defining challenging problems: difficult problems require an inventive solution, and TRIZ provides a range of strategies and tools for finding these inventive solutions. One of the earliest findings of the massive research on which the theory is based is that the vast majority of problems that require inventive solutions typically reflect a need to overcome a dilemma or a trade-off between two contradictory elements. The central purpose of TRIZ-based analysis is to systematically apply the strategies and tools to find superior solutions that overcome the need for a compromise or trade-off between the two elements. Prism of TRIZ By the early 1970s two decades of research covering hundreds of thousands of patents had confirmed Altshuller's initial insight about the patterns of inventive solutions and one of the first analytical tools was published in the form of 40 inventive principles, which could account for virtually all of those patents that presented truly inventive solutions. Following this approach the \\"Conceptual solution\\" shown in the diagram can be found by defining the contradiction which needs to be resolved and systematically considering which of the 40 principles may be applied to provide a specific solution which will overcome the \\"contradiction\\" in the problem at hand, enabling a solution that is closer to the \\"ultimate ideal result\\". Contradictions Matrix The combination of all of these concepts together ‚Äì the analysis of the contradiction, the pursuit of an ideal solution and the search for one or more of the principles which will overcome the contradiction, are the key elements in a process which is designed to help the inventor to engage in the process with purposefulness and focus. 40 principles of TRIZ method rendered schematically One of the tools which evolved as an extension of the 40 principles was a contradiction matrix in which the contradictory elements of a problem were categorized according to a list of 39 factors which could impact on each other. The combination of each pairing of these 39 elements is set out in a matrix (for example, the weight of a stationary object, the use of energy by a moving object, the ease of repair etc.) Each of the 39 elements is represented down the rows and across the columns (as the negatively affected element) and based upon the research and analysis of patents: wherever precedent solutions have been found that resolve a conflict between two of the elements, the relevant cells in the matrix typically contain a sub- set of three or four principles that have been applied most frequently in inventive solutions which resolve contradictions between those two elements. French-English TRIZ principles and English Contradiction Matrix The main objective of the contradiction matrix was to simplify the process of selecting the most appropriate Principle to resolve a specific contradiction. It was the core of all modifications of ARIZ till 1973. But in 1973, after introducing the concept of physical contradictions and creating SuField analysis, Altshuller realized that the contradiction matrix was comparatively an inefficient tool and stopped working on it. Beginning ARIZ-71c contradiction matrix ceased to be the core of ARIZ and therefore was not a tool for solving inventive problems that Altshuller believed should be pursued. Physical contradictions and separation principles as well as SuField analysis, etc. became the core. Despite this, the 40 principles of invention has remained the most popular tool taught in introductory seminars and has consistently attracted the most attention amongst the tens of thousands of individuals who visit TRIZ-focused web sites in a typical month. Therefore, many of those who learn TRIZ or have attended seminars are taught quite wrongly that TRIZ is primarily composed of the 40 principles and contradiction matrix, the truth is ARIZ is the core methodology of TRIZ. ARIZ is an algorithmic approach to finding inventive solutions by identifying and resolving contradictions. This includes the \\"system of inventive standards solutions\\" which Altshuller used to replace the 40 principles and contradiction matrix, it consists of SuField modeling and the 76 inventive standards. A number of TRIZ-based computer programs have been developed whose purpose is to provide assistance to engineers and inventors in finding inventive solutions for technological problems. Some of these programs are also designed to apply another TRIZ methodology whose purpose is to reveal and forecast emergency situations and to anticipate circumstances which could result in undesirable outcomes. One of the important branches of TRIZ is focused on analysing and predicting trends of evolution in the characteristics that existing solutions are likely to develop in successive generations of a system.  Essentials  =Basic terms= *Ideal final result (IFR) - the ultimate idealistic solution of a problem when the desired result is achieved by itself. Note that the Ideal Final Result is also an ARIZ term for the formulation of the inventive problem in the form of a Technical Contradiction (IFR-1) and a Physical Contradiction (IFR-2); *Administrative contradiction - contradiction between the needs and abilities; *Technical contradiction - an inverse dependence between parameters/characteristics of a machine or technology; *Physical contradiction - opposite/contradictory physical requirements to an object; *Separation principle - a method of resolving physical contradictions by separating contradictory requirements; *Vepol or Su-field - a minimal technical system consisting of two material objects (substances) and a \\"field\\". \\"Field\\" is the source of energy whereas one of the substances is \\"transmission\\" and the other one is the \\"tool\\"; *Fepol or Ferfiel - a sort of Vepol (Su-field) where \\"substances\\" are ferromagnetic objects; *Level of invention; *Standard solution - a standard inventive solution of a higher level; *Laws of technical systems evolution; *Algorithm of inventive problems solving (ARIZ), which combines various specialized methods of TRIZ into one universal tool; *Talented Thinking or Thinking in Time and Scale; *Effect : Scientific knowledge to solve problem listed by not alphabetical order but functional order = Identifying a problem: contradictions = Altshuller has shown that at the heart of some inventive problems lie contradictions (one of the basic TRIZ concepts) between two or more elements, such as, \\"If we want more acceleration, we need a larger engine; but that will increase the cost of the car,\\" that is, more of something desirable also brings more of something less desirable, or less of something else also desirable. These are called technical contradictions by Altshuller. He also defined so-called physical or inherent contradictions: More of one thing and less of the same thing may both be desired in the same system. For instance, a higher temperature may be needed to melt a compound more rapidly, but a lower temperature may be needed to achieve a homogeneous mixture. An inventive situation which challenges us to be inventive, might involve several such contradictions. Conventional solutions typically \\"trade\\" one contradictory parameter for another; no special inventiveness is needed for that. Rather, the inventor would develop a creative approach for resolving the contradiction, such as inventing an engine that produces more acceleration without increasing the cost of the engine. =Inventive principles and the matrix of contradictions= Altshuller screened patents in order to find out what kind of contradictions were resolved or dissolved by the invention and the way this had been achieved. From this he developed a set of 40 inventive principles and later a matrix of contradictions. Rows of the matrix indicate the 39 system features that one typically wants to improve, such as speed, weight, accuracy of measurement and so on. Columns refer to typical undesired results. Each matrix cell points to principles that have been most frequently used in patents in order to resolve the contradiction. For instance, Dolgashev mentions the following contradiction: increasing accuracy of measurement of machined balls while avoiding the use of expensive microscopes and elaborate control equipment. The matrix cell in row \\"accuracy of measurement\\" and column \\"complexity of control\\" points to several principles, among them the Copying Principle, which states, \\"Use a simple and inexpensive optical copy with a suitable scale instead of an object that is complex, expensive, fragile or inconvenient to operate.\\" From this general invention principle, the following idea might solve the problem: Taking a high-resolution image of the machined ball. A screen with a grid might provide the required measurement. As mentioned above, Altshuller abandoned this method of defining and solving \\"technical\\" contradictions in the mid 1980s and instead used SuField modeling and the 76 inventive standards and a number of other tools included in the algorithm for solving inventive problems, ARIZ. =Laws of technical system evolution= Altshuller also studied the way technical systems have been developed and improved over time. From this, he discovered several trends (so called Laws of Technical Systems Evolution) that help engineers predict the most likely improvements that can be made to a given product. The most important of these laws involves the ideality of a system. =Substance-field analysis= One more technique that is frequently used by inventors involves the analysis of substances, fields and other resources that are currently not being used and that can be found within the system or nearby. TRIZ uses non-standard definitions for substances and fields. Altshuller developed methods to analyze resources; several of his invention principles involve the use of different substances and fields that help resolve contradictions and increase ideality of a technical system. For instance, videotext systems used television signals to transfer data, by taking advantage of the small time segments between TV frames in the signals. SuField analysis produces a structural model of the initial technological system, exposes its characteristics, and with the help of special laws, transforms the model of the problem. Through this transformation the structure of the solution that eliminates the shortcomings of the initial problem is revealed. SuField analysis is a special language of formulas with which it is possible to easily describe any technological system in terms of a specific (structural) model. A model produced in this manner is transformed according to special laws and regularities, thereby revealing the structural solution of the problem. =ARIZ - algorithm of inventive problems solving= ARIZ (Russian acronym of –∞–ª–≥–æ—Ä–∏—Ç–º —Ä–µ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏–∑–æ–±—Ä–µ—Ç–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∑–∞–¥–∞—á - –ê–†–ò–ó) (algorithm of inventive problems solving) is a list of about 85 step-by- step procedures to solve complicated invention problems, where other tools of TRIZ alone (Sufield analysis, 40 inventive principles, etc.) are not sufficient. Various TRIZ software (see Invention Machine's Goldfire, ideation international, Guided Innovation Toolkit, TriSolver, Innovation Suite, TRIZ GB) are based on this algorithm. Starting with an updated matrix of contradictions, semantic analysis, subcategories of inventive principles and lists of scientific effects, some new interactive applications are other attempts to simplify the problem formulation phase and the transition from a generic problem to a whole set of specific solutions. (See the external links for details.) =Use of TRIZ on Management Problems= Although TRIZ was developed from the analysis of technical systems, it has been used widely as a method for understanding and solving complex management problems. Examples include finding additional cost savings for the legal department of a local government body: the inventive solution generated was to generate additional revenue [insert reference to cost-cutting in local government case study]. The results of the TRIZ work are expected to generate ¬£1.7 m in profit in the first 5 years. Use of TRIZ methods in industry Case studies on the use of TRIZ are difficult to acquire as many companies believe TRIZ gives them a competitive advantage and are reluctant to publicise their adoption of the method. However some examples are available: Samsung is the most famous success story, and has invested heavily in embedding TRIZ use throughout the company, right up to and including the CEO; \\"In 2003 TRIZ led to 50 new patents for Samsung and in 2004 one project alone, a DVD pick-up innovation, saved Samsung over $100 million. TRIZ is now an obligatory skill set if you want to advance within Samsung\\". Rolls-Royce, BAE Systems and GE are all documented users of TRIZ; Mars has documented how applying TRIZ led to a new patent for chocolate packaging. TRIZ has also been used successfully by Leafield Engineering, Smart Stabilizer Systems and Buro Happold to solve problems and generate new patents. Various promoters of TRIZ reported that car companies Rolls-Royce, Ford, and Daimler-Chrysler, Johnson & Johnson, aeronautics companies Boeing, NASA, technology companies Hewlett Packard, Motorola, General Electric, Xerox, IBM, LG, Samsung, Intel, Procter & Gamble, Expedia and Kodak have used TRIZ methods in some projects. The application of TRIZ tools in numerous German industrial companies in the recent decade has followed the principles of the Advanced Innovation Design Approach, which recommends application of the selected TRIZ tools in the early stage of the innovation process for the identification of customer needs, comprehensive problem definition and ideation, new concept development and optimization. European TRIZ Association The European TRIZ Association, ETRIA, is an nonprofit association based in Germany, founded in 2000. ETRIA considers itself an open community to unite the efforts, suggest opportunities for global standardization, conduct further research and development, and provide mechanisms for the exchange of information and knowledge on TRIZ and TRIZ-based innovation technologies. ETRIA is developing a web-based collaborative environment targeting the creation of links between any and all institutions concerned with conceptual questions pertaining to the creation, organization, and efficient processing of innovation knowledge and innovation technologies. TRIZ is considered as a cross-disciplinary, generic methodology, but it has not previously been presented in terms of logic or any other formal knowledge representation. Most of the concepts introduced in TRIZ are fuzzy, and most of the techniques are still heuristic and only partially formalized. For further development and conceptual re-organization of the TRIZ knowledge base, ETRIA involves and collaborates with TRIZ experts and professionals from the domains of logic, organization science, informatics and linguistics. The Association holds conferences with associated publications. =Goals= ETRIA has the following goals: * Research and development of innovation knowledge by integrating conceptual approaches to classification developed by artificial intelligence (AI) and knowledge management communities; * International observation, analysis, evaluation and reporting of progress in these directions; * Promotion and exchange of information and experience between scientists and practitioners in TRIZ, universities and other educational organizations; * Development of TRIZ through contributions from dedicated experts and specialists in particular areas of expertise. = Modifications and derivatives = # SIT (systematic inventive thinking) & SIT Company - A company developed based on this method # USIT (unified structured inventive thinking) # Trizics (Methodology for the systematic application of TRIZ) See also *Brainstorming *C-K theory *Lateral thinking *Method of focal objects *Morphological analysis *Systems theory *Trial-and-error *Systematic Inventive Thinking References Books on TRIZ   Category:1946 introductions Category:Problem solving Category:Creativity techniques Category:Soviet inventions ","title":"TRIZ"},{"id":"287914","title":"Kappa Alpha Society"},{"id":"287916","text":"Alexandra Mikhailovna Kollontai (, n√©e Domontovich, –î–æ–º–æ–Ω—Ç–æÃÅ–≤–∏—á; ‚Äì 9 March 1952) was a Marxist revolutionary and theoretician, first as a member of the Mensheviks, then from 1915 on as a Bolshevik (later a Communist).

He served as a cavalry officer in the Russo- Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) (sometimes referred to as the Bulgarian War of Independence). After his participation in the war, he was appointed Provisional Governor of the Bulgarian city of Tarnovo, and later Military Consul in Sofia. In May 1879, he was called back to St. Petersburg. He entertained liberal political views, favoring a constitutional monarchy like that of United Kingdom.

Alexandra's mother, Alexandra Alexandrovna Masalina (Massalina) (1848‚Äì1899), was the daughter of Alexander Feodorovich Masalin (Massalin) (1809‚Äì1859), a Finnish peasant who had made a fortune selling wood. Alexandra Alexandrovna Masalina became known as Alexandra Alexandrovna Masalina-Mravinskaya after her marriage to her first husband, Konstantin Iosipovich Mravinsky (originally spelled Mrovinsky)Tassie, Gregor (2005). Yevgeny Mravinsky: The Noble Conductor. Lanham/Toronto/Oxford: Scarecrow, p. 1. . (1829‚Äì1921). Her marriage to Mravinsky was an arranged marriage which turned out to be unhappy, and eventually she divorced Mravinsky in order to marry Mikhail Domontovich, with whom she had fallen in love. Russian opera singer Yevgeniya Mravina (stage name) was Kollontai's half- sister via her mother. The celebrated Soviet-Russian conductor Yevgeny Mravinsky, music director of the Leningrad Philharmonic Orchestra for fifty years (1938‚Äì1988), was the only son of Mravina's brother Alexander Kostantinovich and thus Kollontai's half nephew.Tassie, op.cit., Chapters One (The Mrovinskys: \\"To Serve the Emperor\\") and Two (\\"Zhenya\\"), pp. 1‚Äì25. The saga of her parents' long and difficult struggle to be together in spite of the norms of society would color and inform Alexandra Kollontai's own views of relationships, sex, and marriage. 1888 portrait Alexandra Mikhailovna ‚Äì or \\"Shura\\" as she was called growing up ‚Äì was close to her father, with whom she shared an analytical bent and an interest in history and politics. Her relationship with her mother, for whom she was named, was more complex. She later recalled: Alexandra was a good student growing up, sharing her father's interest in history, and mastering a range of languages. She spoke French with her mother and sisters, English with her nanny, Finnish with the peasants at a family estate inherited from her maternal grandfather in Kuusa (in Muolaa, Grand Duchy of Finland), and was a student of German. Alexandra sought to continue her schooling at a university, but her mother refused her permission, arguing that women had no real need for higher education, and that impressionable youngsters encountered too many dangerous radical ideas at universities. Instead, Alexandra was to be allowed to take an exam to gain certification as a school teacher before making her way into society to find a husband, as was the custom. In 1890 or 1891, Alexandra, aged around 19, met her cousin and future husband, Vladimir Ludvigovich Kollontai (9 July 1867 ‚Äì July/August 1917), an engineering student of modest means enrolled at a military institute.Kollontai, Aleksandra (1926), Autobiography..., op. cit.

Alexandra's mother objected bitterly to the potential union since the young man was so poor, to which her daughter replied that she would work as a teacher to help make ends meet. Her mother bitterly scoffed at the notion: International Socialist Congress, Copenhagen 1910. Alexandra Kollontaj holds Clara Zetkin's hand. Behind them is Rosa Luxemburg Her parents forbade the relationship and sent Alexandra on a tour of Western Europe in the hope that she would forget Vladimir, but the pair remained committed to one another despite it all and married in 1893. Alexandra became pregnant soon after her marriage and bore a son, Mikhail, in 1894. She devoted her time to reading radical populist and Marxist political literature and writing fiction. = Early political activism = While Kollontai was initially drawn to the populist ideas of a restructuring of society based upon the Mir commune, she soon abandoned this for other revolutionary projects. Marxism, with its emphasis on the class consciousness of factory workers, the revolutionary seizure of power, and the construction of modern industrial society, held sway with Kollontai as with so many of her peers of Russia's radical intelligentsia. Kollontai's first activities were timid and modest, helping out a few hours a week with her sister Zhenia at a library that supported Sunday classes in basic literacy for urban workers, sneaking a few socialist ideas into the lessons. Through this library Kollontai met Elena Stasova, an activist in the budding Marxist movement in St. Petersburg. Stasova began to use Kollontai as a courier, transporting parcels of illegal writings to unknown individuals, which were delivered upon utterance of a password. Years later, she wrote about her marriage, \\"We separated although we were in love because I felt trapped. I was detached, [from Vladimir], because of the revolutionary upsettings rooted in Russia\\". In 1898 she left little Mikhail with her parents to study economics in Z√ºrich, Switzerland, with Professor Heinrich Herkner. She then paid a visit to England, where she met members of the British socialist movement, including Sidney and Beatrice Webb. She returned to Russia in 1899, at which time she met Vladimir Ilych Ulyanov, better known today as Vladimir Lenin. Kollontai became interested in Marxist ideas while studying the history of working movements in Z√ºrich, under Herkner, later described by her as a Marxist Revisionist. She became a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1899 at the age of 27. In 1905, Kollontai was a witness to the popular uprising known as Bloody Sunday at Saint Petersburg in front of the Winter Palace. At the time of the split in the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party between the Mensheviks under Julius Martov and the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin in 1903, Kollontai did not side with either faction at first, and \\"offered her services to both factions\\".Simkin, John, Alexandra Kollontai, at Spartacus Educational In 1906, however, disapproving of \\"the hostile position taken by the Bolsheviks towards the Duma\\" and despite her being generally a left-winger, she decided to join the Mensheviks. She went into exile, to Germany, in 1908 after publishing \\"Finland and Socialism\\", which called on the Finnish people to rise up against oppression within the Russian Empire. She traveled across western Europe and became acquainted with Karl Kautsky, Clara Zetkin, Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht, among others. Alexander Shliapnikov, Kollontai's fighting comrade and, for some time, her lover Alexandra and her second husband, leftIn 1911, while abruptly breaking off her long-term relationship with her faction comrade (1867‚Äì1946), an agrarian scientist, she started a love affair with another fellow exile, Alexander Gavrilovich Shliapnikov. The couple appeared quite oddly assorted: she was a Menshevik intellectual, of noble origins, thirteen years older than him; he was a self-taught metalworker from provincial Russia and a Bolshevik leading exponent of some prominence. Their romantic relationship came to an end in July 1916, but evolved thereafter into a long-lasting friendship as they wound up sharing many of the same general political views. They were still in contact during early 1930s when Kollontai lived abroad in a sort of diplomatic exile, and Shliapnikov was going to be executed during the Soviet purges. With the onset of World War I in 1914, Kollontai left Germany due to the German social democrats' support of the war. Kollontai was strongly opposed to the war and very outspoken against it, and in June 1915 she broke with the Mensheviks and officially joined the Bolsheviks, \\"those who most consistently fought social-patriotism\\". After leaving Germany, Kollontai traveled to Denmark, only to discover that the Danish social democrats also supported the war. The next place where Kollontai tried to speak and write against the war was Sweden, but the Swedish government imprisoned her for her activities. After her release, Kollontai traveled to Norway, where she at last found a socialist community that was receptive to her ideas. Kollontai stayed primarily in Norway until 1917, traveling twice to United States to speak about war and politics and to renew her relationship with her son Mikhail, for whom she had arranged in 1916 to avoid conscription by going to the United States to work on Russian orders from U.S. factories. In 1917, Kollontai left Norway to return to Russia upon receiving news of Tsar's abdication and the onset of the Russian Revolution. = Russian Revolution = When Lenin returned to Russia in April 1917, Kollontai was the only major leader of the Petrograd Bolsheviks who immediately voiced her full support for his radical and nonconformist new proposals (the so-called \\"April theses\\"). She was a member of the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet, and \\"for the rest of 1917, [she] was a constant agitator for revolution in Russia as a speaker, leaflet writer and worker on the Bolshevik women's paper Rabotnitsa\\".Ringer, p. 189. Following the July uprising against the Provisional Government, she was arrested along with many other Bolshevik leaders, but was given again her full freedom of movement in September: she was then a member of the party's Central Committee and as such she voted for the policy of armed uprising that led to the October Revolution. At the Second All-Russian Congress of Soviets on 26 October, she was elected People's Commissar for Social Welfare in the first Soviet government, but she soon resigned in opposition to the Brest-Litovsk Peace. During the revolutionary period, at the age of 45, she married 28-year-old revolutionary sailor Pavel Dybenko, while keeping her surname from her first marriage. Sovnarkom session between December 1917 and January 1918. Kollontai is seated in the centre on Lenin's left; Shlyapnikov is the second on his right; Kollontai's husband Dybenko is standing behind her with Stalin on his right Third Congress of the Communist International (1921). Alexandra Kollontai alongside Clara Zetkin (front row, on her right) She was the most prominent woman in the Soviet administration and was best known for founding the Zhenotdel or \\"Women's Department\\" in 1919 . This organization worked to improve the conditions of women's lives in the Soviet Union, fighting illiteracy and educating women about the new marriage, education, and work laws put in place by the Revolution. It was eventually closed in 1930. In political life, Kollontai increasingly became an internal critic of the Communist Party and at the end of 1920 she sided with the Workers' Opposition, a left-wing faction of the party that had its roots in the trade union milieu and was led by Shlyapnikov and by Sergei Medvedev.Condit, Tom, Alexandra Kollontai, at Marxists Internet Archive On 25 January 1921, \\"Pravda\\" published a pamphlet by Kollontai, bearing the title The Workers' Opposition, which advocated unionized workers' control over economic activity management and blamed bourgeois and bureaucratic influences over Soviet institutions and the party itself.Simkin, John, Workers' Opposition, at Spartacus Educational. The text of Kollonai's pamphlet is accessible online at Marxists Internet Archive. According to John Simkin, on 27 February 1921 trade unionists supporting the Workers' Opposition published a proclamation calling for 'freedom of speech, press and assembly for all who labour', and for the 'liberation of all arrested Socialists and non-partisan workers.'Alexander Shlyapnikov at Spartacus Educational However, at the Tenth Party Congress of 1921, internal factions were banned and the Workers's Opposition was dissolved with immediate effect, after which Kollontai was more or less politically sidelined. Nevertheless, despite subsequent misunderstandings with the former leaders of the Workers' Opposition and Kollontai's own resentment at their having renounced the pamphlet she had written to support the faction, on 5 July 1921 she tried again 'to help [them] by speaking on their behalf to the Third Congress of the Comintern'. In her speech, she bitterly attacked the New Economic Policy proposed by Lenin, warning that it 'threatened to disillusion workers, to strengthen the peasantry and petty bourgeoisie, and to facilitate the rebirth of capitalism'. Kollontai's final political action as an oppositionist within the Communist Party was her co-signing of the so-called \\"letter of the 22\\", whereby several former members of the Workers' Opposition and other party members of working class origins appealed to the Communist International against the undemocratic internal practices in use within the Russian party.Shliapnikov: Appeal of the 22 at Marxists Internet Archive When 'Kollontai attempted to speak before the Comintern Executive on 26 February 1922 on behalf of the views expressed in the appeal,' Trotsky and Zinoviev had her name removed from the list of orators and insisted that she should not take the floor. When she 'proved recalcitrant, Trotsky forbade her to speak and issued a decree, in the name of the CC, ordering all members of the Russian delegation to \\"obey the directives of the party\\".' Predictably, the appeal of the 22 was unsuccessful. At the Eleventh Party Congress (March‚ÄìApril 1922), Kollontai, Shlyapnikov and Medvedev were charged with having insisted on factional work and their expulsion from the party was proposed. In her defensive speech before the Congress, Kollontai emphasized her loyalty to the party and her devotion to giving the leading role in the party and outside it to the working class, she proclaimed her full observance of the previous year's decree on party unity, and concluded: 'If there is no place for this in our party, then exclude me. But even outside the ranks of our party, I will live, work and fight for the Communist party.' Eventually, a resolution was passed allowing the three to remain in the party unless they committed further violations of its discipline. = Soviet diplomatic career = Kollontai after being awarded the Order of St. Olav at the Norwegian embassy in 1946 From late 1922, Kollontai was appointed to various diplomatic positions abroad and was thus prevented from playing any further leading role at home. Initially, she was sent as an attach√© to the Soviet commercial mission in Norway, becoming the world's third woman serving in diplomacy in modern times, after the First Republic of Armenia representative to Japan Diana Apcar and the First Hungarian Republic representative to Switzerland Rosika Schwimmer. In early 1924, Kollontai was first promoted to Charg√© d'affaires and from August to Minister Plenipotentiary. As such, she later served in Mexico (1926‚Äì27), again in Norway (1927‚Äì30) and eventually in Sweden (1930‚Äì45), where she was finally promoted to Ambassador in 1943.Iring Fetscher, 'Afterword', in A. Kollontaj, Autobiography of a sexually emancipated woman, London, Orbach and Chambers, 1972, p. 105 ff. When Kollontai was in Stockholm, the Winter War between Russia and Finland broke out; it has been said that it was largely due to her influence that Sweden remained neutral. After the war, she received Vyacheslav Molotov's praises. During late April 1943, Kollontai may have been involved in abortive peace negotiations with Hans Thomsen, her German counterpart in Stockholm. She was also a member of the Soviet delegation to the League of Nations. Kollontai retired in 1945. = Political retreat and attitude toward Stalinism = Being sent abroad in a sort of de facto exile for over twenty years, Kollontai gave up \\"her fight for reform and for women, retreating into relative obscurity\\"Morrison. and bowing to the new political climate. She discarded her feminist concerns and \\"offered no objection to the patriarchal legislation of 1926 and the constitution of 1936, which deprived Soviet women of many of the gains they had achieved after the February and October Revolutions\\". The following words she allegedly pronounced in a private conversation with her friend in 1929 give a suggestion of her attitude towards advancing Stalinism: \\"Everything's changed so much. What can I do about this? One cannot go against the 'apparatus'. For my part, I have put my principles aside in a corner of my conscience and I pursue as best I can the policies they dictate to me\\". Three years earlier, in 1926, when she was requested to write her own autobiography for a series on famous women by Munich publisher Helga Kern, she deemed it necessary to completely revise the first draft of her work she had handed over to the publisher, by deleting practically all references to 'dangerous' topics, as well as the parts mentioning or just hinting at her former critical positions and those having a personal nature that might be regarded as forms of self-celebration. On asking the publisher to make the changes requested, Kollontai apologized with obvious embarrassment, inviting repeatedly to debit her all expenses and writing twice that, under current circumstances, it was not absolutely possible \\"to do otherwise\\". The degree of her adherence to the prevailing ideas of the Stalinist regime, whether it was spontaneous or not, may be gauged from the opening of an article she wrote in 1946 for a Russian magazine. It bore the title The Soviet Woman ‚Äî a Full and Equal Citizen of Her Country, and praised the Soviet Union's advances of women's rights, while simultaneously emphasizing a view of the role of women in society at odds with her previous writings on women's liberation. Aleksandra Kollontai's tomb at Novodevichy Cemetery = Death and legacy = Alexandra Kollontai died in Moscow on 9 March 1952, less than a month from her 80th birthday. She was the only member of the Bolsheviks' Central Committee that had led the October Revolution who managed to live into the 1950s, other than Stalin himself and his devoted supporter Matvei Muranov. She has sometimes been criticized and even held up to contempt for not raising her voice during the Stalinist purges, when, among countless others, her former husband, her former lover and fighting comrade, and so many friends of hers were executed. And, it has been noted, at the time she \\"was safe in her sumptuous Stockholm residence\\". Notwithstanding, it should also be pointed out that, even so, Kollontai did not enjoy a full liberty of action and had to worry about the possible fates of her family. It might not have been pure chance if both her only son and her musician half- nephew (whom she had much supported at the beginning of his career) also came unscathed through the persecution of the Stalinist regime, to the establishment of which she had, however, significantly contributed. The resurgence of radicalism in the 1960s and the growth of the feminist movement in the 1970s spurred a new interest in the life and writings of Alexandra Kollontai all around the world. A spate of books and pamphlets by and about Kollontai were subsequently published, including full-length biographies by historians Cathy Porter, Beatrice Farnsworth, and Barbara Evans Clements. Kollontai was the subject of the 1994 TV film, A Wave of Passion: The Life of Alexandra Kollontai, with Glenda Jackson as the voice of Kollontai. A female Soviet diplomat in the 1930s with unconventional views on sexuality, probably inspired by Kollontai, had been played by Greta Garbo in the movie Ninotchka (1939).  Contributions to Marxist feminism  To dear comrade Louise Bryant from her friend Alexandra Kollontay, Petrograd, 1 September 1918. As an unwavering Marxist, Kollontai opposed the ideology of liberal feminism, which she saw as bourgeois. She was a champion of women's liberation, but she firmly believed that it \\"could take place only as the result of the victory of a new social order and a different economic system\\", and has thus been regarded as a key figure in Marxist feminism.Lokaneeta, Jinee (2001), \\"Alexandra Kollontai and Marxist Feminism\\". Economic and Political Weekly. Vol. 36, No. 17 (28 April ‚Äì 4 May 2001), pp. 1405‚Äì1412.Nye, Andrea (1988). Feminist Theory and the Philosophies of Man. New York/London: Routledge. Chapter 3 (\\"A Community of Men: Marxism and Women\\"), Section: \\"Marxist feminists: Zetkin, Kollontai, Goldman\\", pp. 40‚Äì54. . She criticized bourgeois feminists for prioritizing political goals, such as women's suffrage, that would provide political equality for bourgeois women but would do little to address the immediate conditions of working-class women, and was further distrustful that bourgeois champions of feminism would continue to support their working class counterparts after succeeding in their struggle for \\"general women's\\" rights, as exemplified by the following quote: Kollontai is known for her advocacy of free love. However, this does not mean that she advocated casual sexual encounters; indeed, she believed that due to the inequality between men and women that persisted under socialism, such encounters would lead to women being exploited, and being left to raise children alone. Instead she believed that true socialism could not be achieved without a radical change in attitudes to sexuality, so that it might be freed from the oppressive norms that she saw as a continuation of bourgeois ideas about property. A common myth describes her as a proponent of the \\"glass of water\\" theory of sexuality.Ebert, Teresa (1999) \\"Alexandra Kollontai and Red Love\\" (Retrieved 24 February 2016). The quote \\"...the satisfaction of one's sexual desires should be as simple as getting a glass of water\\"Lunacharsky, \\"–û –ë–´–¢–ï:–ú–û–õ–û–î–ï–ñ–¨ –ò –¢–ï–û–†–ò–Ø ‚Äû–°–¢–ê–ö–ê–ù–ê –í–û–î–´\\"\\" (\\"On Everyday Life: Young People and the \\"Glass of Water\\" Theory) is often mistakenly attributed to her. This is likely a distortion of the moment in her short story \\"Three Generations\\" when a young female Komsomol member argues that sex \\"is as meaningless as drinking a glass of vodka [or water, depending on the translation] to quench one's thirst.\\" In number 18 of her Theses on Communist Morality in the Sphere of Marital Relations, Kollontai argued that \\"...sexuality is a human instinct as natural as hunger or thirst.\\" Kollontai's views on the role of marriage and the family under Communism were arguably more influential on today's society than her advocacy of \\"free love.\\" Kollontai believed that, like the state, the family unit would wither away once the second stage of communism became a reality. She viewed marriage and traditional families as legacies of the oppressive, property-rights-based, egoist past. Under Communism, both men and women would work for, and be supported by, society, not their families. Similarly, their children would be wards of, and reared basically by society. Kollontai admonished men and women to discard their nostalgia for traditional family life. \\"The worker-mother must learn not to differentiate between yours and mine; she must remember that there are only our children, the children of Russia's communist workers.\\" However, she also praised maternal attachment: \\"Communist society will take upon itself all the duties involved in the education of the child, but the joys of parenthood will not be taken away from those who are capable of appreciating them.\\"  Awards  * Order of Lenin (1933) * Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1945) * Knights Grand Cross of the Royal Norwegian Order of St. Olav (Norwegian highest award at the time) * Order of the Aztec Eagle (1944) Commemorative stamp issued by the Soviet Union in 1972  Works  * \\"The Attitude of the Russian Socialists,\\" The New Review, March 1916, pp. 60‚Äì61. * Vasilisa Malygina (–í–∞—Å–∏–ª–∏—Å–∞ –ú–∞–ª—ã–≥–∏–Ω–∞). novel, 1923 * Red Love [novel].

They form the central part of a complex hydrological system, in the Cambodian floodplain covered with a mosaic of natural and agricultural habitats that the Mekong replenishes with water and sediments annually. The central plain formation is the result of millions of years of Mekong alluvial deposition and discharge. From a geological perspective, the Tonl√© Sap Lake and Tonl√© Sap River are a current freeze-frame representation of the slowly but continuously shifting lower Mekong basin. Annual fluctuation of the Mekong's water volume, supplemented by the Asian monsoon regime, causes a unique flow reversal of the Tonle Sap River. The Tonl√© Sap Lake occupies a geological depression (the lowest lying area) of the vast alluvial and lacustrine floodplain in the lower Mekong basin, which has been induced by the collision of the Indian Plate with the Eurasian Plate. The lake's size, length and water volume varies considerably over the course of a year from an area of around , a volume of and a length of at the end of the dry season in late-April to an area of up to , a volume of and a length of as the Mekong maximum and the peak of the southwest monsoon's precipitation culminate in September and early-October. As one of the world's most varied and productive ecosystems the region has always been of central importance for Cambodia's food supply. It proved capable of largely maintaining the Angkorean civilization, the largest pre-industrial settlement complex in world history. Directly and indirectly it affects the livelihood of large numbers of a predominantly rural population. Due to ineffective administration and widespread indifference towards environmental issues, the lake and its surrounding ecosystem are coming under increasing pressure from over- exploitation and habitat degradation, fragmentation, and loss. All Mekong riparian states have either announced or already implemented plans to increasingly exploit the river's hydroelectric potential. A succession of international facilities that dam the river's mainstream is likely to be the gravest danger yet for the entire Tonle Sap eco-region. The largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia, it contains an exceptional large variety of interconnected eco-regions with a high degree of biodiversity and is therefore a biodiversity hotspot. It was designated a UNESCO biosphere reserve in 1997. Overview Lower Mekong basin Tonle Sap inhabitants The lower Mekong basin (LMB) encompasses the lower half of the Mekong River's length of and the surrounding drainage basin of around . It is divided into five distinct physiographic units: the northern highlands; the Annamite chain; the southern uplands; the Korat Plateau; and the Mekong plain. These regions each have distinct geology, climate, vegetation and human-use patterns. The lower Mekong basin rests on an ancient block of continental crust that has remained relatively stable since the Jurassic Period, a period of over 150 million years. Large areas were covered by an inland sea during the upper Mesozoic Era, during which thick red-bed sandstones and evaporites were deposited. The Sekong, Sesan, and Srepok Rivers‚Äîcollectively called the 3S Basin‚Äîare the dominant tributaries. All three enter the Mekong on the eastern bank. At the southern end of the basin, the mainstream breaks up into a complex network of branching and reconnecting channels. One of these branches forms the Tonle Sap River. The western and central parts of the southern basin make up the great lake. The lower Mekong basin experiences two monsoon periods: rain from May to October and a dry season from November to March. The annual rainfall is between 1,000 and 3,000 mm, locally up to 4,000 mm, falling almost entirely during the rainy season. Water levels reach their highest in September and October. The Great Lake ecosystem =Cambodian floodplain= Map of Tonl√© Sap lake, river, and drainage basin The Cambodian floodplain or the Mekong Plain is a vast low-lying area traversed by the Mekong River. Only a relatively small portion of the plain consists of fluviatile deposits of the young Mekong. The plain encompasses most of lowland Cambodia and the Mekong delta of Vietnam, a small part of southern Laos, and a small part of eastern Thailand in Chantaburi and Prachinburi Provinces. It is bordered by the Dangrek Mountains on the north, the Elephant and Cardomom mountains on the south, and the southern Annamite Range on the east. The plain is about 800 kilometers from north to south and 600 kilometers from east to west. It is mostly less than 100 meters in elevation, but a few higher outcroppings are scattered throughout the plain and much of northern Cambodia is characterized by rolling and dissected plains between 100 and 200 meters elevation. The plain is the result of erosion and sedimentation. The sediments vary in depth from at least 500 meters near the mouth of the Mekong to only about 30 meters at Phnom Penh, with bedrock outcroppings in isolated hills above the plain in several places. The Tonle Sap is the largest freshwater lake in Southeast Asia and one of the richest inland fishing grounds in the world. The lake functions as a natural flood water reservoir for the Mekong system as a whole by regulating the floods downstream from Phnom Penh during the wet season and makes an important supplement to the dry season flow to the Mekong delta. =Wetlands, flooded forests, and deciduous forests= A belt of freshwater mangroves known as the \\"flooded forest\\" surrounds the lake. The floodplains in turn are surrounded by low hills, covered with evergreen or deciduous seasonal tropical forest dominated by species of Dipterocarpaceae, Leguminosae, Lythraceae, Fagaceae and in some places Pinaceae, Podocarpaceae, or bamboo. The eco-region consists of a mosaic of habitats for a great number of species. The forest gradually yields to bushes and finally grassland with increasing distance from the lake. On higher quality soils or at higher elevation, areas of mixed deciduous forest and semi-evergreen forests occur. This variety of vegetation types accounts for the quantity and diversity of species of the Great Lake ecosystem. Interlocking forest, grassland, and marshland patches provide refuge for the local wildlife. The lake's flooded forest and the surrounding floodplains are of utmost importance for Cambodia's agriculture as the region represents the cultural heart of Cambodia, the center of the national freshwater fishery industry, the nation's primary protein source. Threats to the lake include widespread pollution, stress through growth of the local population which is dependent on the lake for subsistence and livelihood, over-harvesting of fish and other aquatic, often endangered, species, habitat destruction, and potential changes in the hydrology, such as the construction and operation of dams, that disrupt the lake's natural flood cycle. However, concerns that the lake is rapidly filling with sediment seem to be unfounded at the present time.  Volume fluctuation and flow reversal  Tonle Sap Lake over the course of one year Inflow starts in May or June with maximum rates of flow of around by late-August and ends in October or November, amplified by precipitation of the annual monsoon. In November the lake reaches its maximum size. The annual monsoon coincides to cease around this time of the year. As the Mekong River is at its minimum flow around this time of the year and its water level falls deeper than the Tonle Sap Lake, the Tonle Sap River and surrounding wetlands, waters of the lake's basin drains via the Tonle Sap River into the Mekong. As a result, the Tonle Sap River flows six months a year from southeast (Mekong) to northwest (lake) and six months a year in the opposite direction. The mean annual reverse flow volume in the Tonle Sap is , or about half of the maximum lake volume. A further 10 percent is estimated to enter the system by overland flow from the Mekong. The Mekong branches off into several arms near Phnom Penh and reaches Vietnamese territory south of Koh Thom and Loek Daek Districts of Kandal Province.  Sedimentation  Although the large amount of sediment in the Tonl√© Sap Lake basin is a natural phenomenon, rapid rates of development and resource exploitation has focused the attention of observers who fear the basin is in danger of filling with sediment. These fears were first reported by local people who noticed some areas becoming shallower. With increased sedimentation, already vague transit routes between capital and regional centers would likely be shut down altogether and could restrict the migration of fish into the lake. Because sediment contains nutrients that fuel food webs, the Tonl√© Sap benefits from the influx. Sediment-bound phosphorus serves as food for phytoplankton through higher plants, and research has shown that the metabolizing of the chemical contributes to food abundance and quality. Internal nutrient cycling, therefore, plays an essential role in productivity of a floodplain. The nutrients bound to suspended sediments are important for the Tonle Sap system, particularly its long-term sustainability.Sediment: Curse or Blessing for Tonle Sap Lake? The reversal of the Tonl√© Sap River's flow also acts as a safety valve to prevent flooding further downstream. During the dry season (December to April) Tonl√© Sap Lake provides around 50 percent of the flow to the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. The lake occupies a depression created due to the geological stress induced by the collision of the Indian subcontinent with Asia. In recent years, there have been concerns from scientists about the building of high dams and other changed hydrological parameters in southern China and Laos that has threatened the strength and volume of the reverse flow into Tonle Sap, which in turn decreases nesting, breeding, spawning, and feeding habitats in the floodplain, which results in adverse impacts on fish productivity and overall biodiversity. Fishing =Fishery management system= The 1987 fiat fishery law is still in force. Many of the regulations are largely based on colonial legislation. The fisheries of Cambodia can be divided in two broad categories: limited and open-access fisheries. The most productive part of the Cambodian fisheries has been privatized for more than a century through a system of government leases on fishing lots. The rest is open-access. In the recent past, the lot system provided over US$2 million annually in tax revenues and more in an informal way. Open-access fisheries do not contribute to the public treasury. When the Tonl√© Sap floods, the surrounding areas become a prime breeding ground for fish. During this time, fishers are scarce. Fishing during this period is illegal, to prevent disruption of mating. At the end of the rainy season, when the water levels go down, fishing is allowed again. Fishermen install floating houses along one half of the river, and the other half is left open for navigation. Most of the fishing captains are of Vietnamese origin, and they are primary suppliers to the country's markets. Fisherman Sakaloy explains, \\"My parents were fishermen. We have lived in Cambodia and have this activity for a long time. We started well before the Pol Pot era, when the Khmer Rouge took over from 1975 to 1979. We had to flee to Vietnam, [but] afterwards we came back and have been fishing on the Tonl√© Sap ever since.\\" Thousands of peasants follow this lifestyle. Fishing Tonle Sap Catching Tonl√© Sap fish is simple. Later, the real work begins. Because of the drop in the water level, the Tonl√© Sap naturally carries away thousands of fish. Fishers place cone- shaped nets into the water from their floating houses and then lift the net as soon as seconds later. Using this technique, two or three tons of fish are trapped each time and more than ten thousand tons of fish can be caught in under a week. One by one, fishers, mostly women, cut off the fish heads then take the fish back to the river to be cleaned and to remove the fat. Salting the fish for preservation is the final step in this process, but the fish will continue to macerate for several months in order to become a paste called prahok, a condiment that complements almost any dish. On average, three days of fishing supply enough prahok for an entire year. Grilling fish at a local market Fishers use all parts of the fish for their own needs and also for profit. Fish heads are dried in the sun, becoming a good fertilizer. By boiling the fat from the bottom of the fish basket, fishermen make soap for their own use. Through bartering on the banks, they exchange fish for rice. Excess rice is sold for profit. Despite paying employees and buying an official fishing license, fishermen still \\"have enough money to feed a family for a year. So I don't need rice fields.\\" To further emphasize the importance of fish in the local economy, the name of Cambodian currency is \\"riel\\", the name of a small silver carp that is the staple of most diets. Because of the Buddhist prescriptions against taking a life, Cambodians tend to limit fishing to the amount necessary to feed their families. To further lessen their guilt, fishermen do not physically kill fish. Instead they wait for the fish to die naturally when taken out of the water. Even so, fishers go to temple after the fishing season for purification.  Cultivated lands and rice  The beginning of the dry season is also the beginning of rice season, which is the only source of wealth for peasants. A good harvest will provide enough rice for them to survive for the entire year, but if the floods are too big or too small, rice can become scarce. Because of this uncontrollable instability, many celebrations are held in honor of gods and genies that can influence nature and bring about a good harvest. Tonle sap rice fields Historical research has shown that the old Angkorian civilization took advantage of the weather conditions by digging huge reservoirs during the wet season and releasing the water during the dry season using an irrigation system and the land‚Äôs natural slope. This double and sometimes even tripled the amount of rice crops per year, strengthening the developing nation. However, today, this irrigation network is no longer present, and peasants only get one rice crop a year. What has not changed is the planting of rice in fields as well as the survival value of rice. It is still the main source of income for peasants and the only currency used to bargain. They use the crops to pay for what they need, such as property rent for land to plant, and the rest is kept for the family to eat. A villager harvesting rice At the end of the rice season, villagers celebrate by marching in a procession to the temple. This is a chance for everyone to relax after the long labor of the harvest season. As well, it provides an opportunity to have fun and bond with the community. All the villagers wear their nicest clothes, musicians sing and dance, and men take the opportunity to court young women. Upon arrival, believers circle the temple three times and then proceed to present gifts such as clothing, dishes, furniture, and food. These donations, named Kathen by Buddha, provide help for bonzis, who in turn give blessings. This act of donation is essential in accumulating good karma for reincarnation, so eventually to reach Nirvana, or ultimate salvation, as well as for future harvests.  Species diversity  Crocodile farm near Tonle sap The lake is home to at least 149 species of fish, eleven globally threatened species, and six near-threatened species. These threatened and near-threatened species include the spot-billed pelican, greater adjutant, Bengal florican, Oriental darter, grey-headed fish eagle, and the Manchurian reed warbler. Specifically, the large colonies of unique birds constitute the Preak Toal Bird sanctuary. In addition, the Tonl√© sap also supports significant reptile populations including nearly extinct Siamese crocodiles and a large number of freshwater snakes. Although the area around the lake has been modified for settlement and farming, about 200 species of plants have been recorded. One of the most legendary species living in the Tonl√© sap is the Mekong giant catfish, one of the largest freshwater fish in the world. The fish is long and can weigh anywhere between . The largest of these catfish ever caught weighed . Despite its massive physical characteristics, the Mekong catfish is especially vulnerable to chemical changes, which is beneficial in alerting authorities of trouble in the river ecosystem early on. The population of these fish has been steadily declining since the Khmer Rouge era, led by Pol Pot, and in 2005, fisherman reported that on average only one giant catfish was caught per day. Currently, it is illegal for fishermen to catch and keep these fish with the exception of a few retained by fisheries for research. It also cannot be used in any form of trade in fear of the economic exploitation. Tonl√© Sap Biosphere Reserve Spot-billed pelican Mekong giant catfish In 1997, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, deemed Tonl√© Sap an ecological hotspot. As a result, in 2001, by royal Decree issued by the government of Cambodia, the lake and its surrounding provinces became the Tonl√© Sap Biosphere Reserve. There are nine provinces that are part of the Tonle Sap Biosphere Reserve. These are Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Kampong Chhnang, Kampong Thom, Preah Vihear, Pursat, Siem Reap, Oddar Meanchey and Pailin. The Cambodian government takes responsibility for the fulfillment of three functions: * a) a conservation function to contribute to the protection of biological diversity, landscapes, and ecosystem, including genetic resources, plant, fishery and animal species, and to the restoration of the essential character of the environment and habitat of biodiversity; * b) a development function to foster sustainable development of ecology, environment, economy, society, and culture; * c) a logistic function to provide support for demonstration projects, environmental education and training, research and monitoring of environment related to the local, national and global issues of conservation and sustainable development. Additionally, the Tonl√© Sap Biosphere Reserve established three zones: a core zone, a buffer zone, and a transition zone. Formally, the core area of a Biosphere Reserve is defined as an area devoted to biological resources, landscapes, and ecosystems. The core zone includes practices that protect sites for conserving biodiversity, monitoring minimally disturbed ecosystems and undertaking non-destructive research and related activities. As of today, the three zones are Prek Toal, Boeng Chhmar, and Stung Sen. Despite this government protection, illegal fishing, poaching, and cutting of the forest for farmland are all still major problems. Because people living around the lake are extremely poor and depend on the lake for their survival, it is likely that this unsustainable living will continue. During recent years, the amount of fish caught has been steadily declining, which means peasants must also work harder to provide for their families. The government is working on supporting and educating these people to break this cycle of poverty and non- sustainability. Finding a balance between survival and conservation seems to be the major question for the future.  Cultural significance ‚Äì people and culture  =Celebration of the Seven-Headed snake= Tonle Sap stilt houses This celebration also goes by the name Water and Moon Festival and was established to mark the reversal of the Tonl√© sap and open the fishing season. The festival lasts three days and begins on the last day of the full moon. However, because of the variation of the monsoon seasons, the reversal of the river does not always coincide exactly with the festival. In the simplest form, the celebration is a series of canoe races, including some 375 teams, and victory brings good fortune for the coming fishing season for the entire village. In addition, these water celebrations are a tribute to a tooth lost in the depths by a nƒÅga whose daughter married a Buddhist Indian prince to establish the kingdom of Cambodia. According to legend, when he was cremated, his tooth fell into the river down to the nƒÅga kingdom. In pagodas along the river, men prepare for the festival by either restoring sacred canoes that have existed for hundreds of years or building new canoes when the old ones are beyond repair. Canoes are made from one piece of a trunk of a coki tree; the wood of the coki tree is resistant to rotting. Each canoe is painted with patterns and eyes that symbolize the guardian goddess, often the spirit of a young tillage girl. This is a modification from the superstitious tradition of sacrifice of nailing actual eyes to the boat dating back before Buddhism. The morning after completion and after three sacred shouts by the crew, the canoes are pushed into the river and head for the capital at full moon. Some crews must row for hours, and others will row for several days. Being chosen as a member of the crew is one of a man‚Äôs highest honors, and members must practice to perfect team coordination. Only the best crews will get to the finals in the capital. After two days of racing, all of the canoes come together to encourage the nƒÅga to spit out the swelling waters of the Tonl√© sap towards the sea. Firecrackers light the water, the royal palace, and the sky. This moment lets the legendary snake master of water know to return to the depths of the Tonl√© sap and leave the power to the sun gods. This also marks the end of the rainy season.Children of the Seven-Headed Snake. Dir. Didier Fassio. Perf. Didier Fassio. Film Makers Library, 2002. Film. The area is home to many ethnic Vietnamese and numerous Cham communities, living in floating villages around the lake. Approximately 1.2 million people living in the greater Tonle sap make their living by fishing on the local waters. Cambodia produces about 400,000 tonnes of freshwater fish per year, the majority of which comes from Tonle sap. These fisheries account for 16 percent of national GDP, making the fish industry not only essential to the diet of local populations but to the Cambodian economy as a whole.

It is considered one of the more Anglo-Catholic jurisdictions among Continuing Anglican church bodies. History At the founding of the Continuing Anglican movement in 1977 at the Congress of St. Louis, a proposed constitution for a new Anglican church in North America was put before the four existing dioceses for ratification. The two which did ratify the constitution later adopted the name Anglican Catholic Church. The two which did not ratify because of concerns that the role of the new church's bishops was overly narrow, elected to continue under the original name of the movement. One of these non-ratifying dioceses, the Diocese of the Southeastern States, dissolved within a short time leaving only the Diocese of Christ the King under its bishop ordinary, Robert Morse of California. On June 29, 2007, James E. Provence was elected as successor to Morse upon the latter's retirement as archbishop of the province. Morse continued as provost of St. Joseph of Arimathea Anglican Theological Seminary which he was instrumental in founding in 1979. Provence resigned on July 20, 2015, and Frederick G. Morrison was elected to succeed him as archbishop. Morrison retired on January 1, 2020, and was replaced by Archbishop John E Upham. Name A new name, Province of Christ the King, was adopted as the church expanded to become a nationwide jurisdiction spanning the United States. The province was later known as the Anglican Province of Christ the King. Parishes The APCK has over forty parishes across three dioceses organized geographically. Sixteen of its parishes are in California, and its seminary, Saint Joseph of Arimathea Anglican Theological College, is located one block south of the University of California, Berkeley. On July 25, 2007, the bishop and most of the parishes in the Eastern Diocese of the APCK withdrew, joining the Anglican Church in America. However, four of its parishes decided to remain within the APCK.

Moving to Miami as a young woman to work for The Miami Herald, she became a freelance writer, producing over one hundred short stories that were published in popular magazines. Her most influential work was the book The Everglades: River of Grass (1947), which redefined the popular conception of the Everglades as a treasured river instead of a worthless swamp. Its impact has been compared to that of Rachel Carson's influential book Silent Spring (1962). Her books, stories, and journalism career brought her influence in Miami, enabling her to advance her causes. As a young woman, Douglas was outspoken and politically conscious of the women's suffrage and civil rights movements. She was called upon to take a central role in the protection of the Everglades when she was 79 years old. For the remaining 29 years of her life she was \\"a relentless reporter and fearless crusader\\" for the natural preservation and restoration of South Florida.Grunwald, p. 204. Her tireless efforts earned her several variations of the nickname \\"Grande Dame of the Everglades\\"Basse, Craig (May 14, 1998). \\"Grande dame of the Everglades.\\" St. Petersburg Times (Florida); p. 1A. as well as the hostility of agricultural and business interests looking to benefit from land development in Florida. She received numerous awards, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and was inducted into several halls of fame. Douglas lived to 108, working until nearly the end of her life for Everglades restoration. Upon her death, an obituary in The Independent in London stated, \\"In the history of the American environmental movement, there have been few more remarkable figures than Marjory Stoneman Douglas.\\"Cornwell, Rupert (May 25, 1998). \\"Obituary: Marjory Stoneman Douglas.\\" The Independent (London); p. 16. Early life The Stoneman and Trefethen extended family in 1893. Marjory is held by her father on the far right. Marjory Stoneman was born on April 7, 1890, in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the only child of Frank Bryant Stoneman (1857‚Äì1941) and Florence Lillian Trefethen (1859‚Äì1912), a concert violinist. One of her earliest memories was her father reading to her The Song of Hiawatha, at which she burst into sobs upon hearing that the tree had to give its life in order to provide Hiawatha the wood for a canoe.Douglas, p. 42. She was an early and voracious reader. Her first book was Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, which she kept well into adulthood until \\"some fiend in human form must have borrowed it and not brought it back\\". She visited Florida when she was four, and her most vivid memory of the trip was picking an orange from a tree at the Tampa Bay Hotel.Douglas, p. 31. From there she and her parents embarked on a cruise from Tampa to Havana.Duncan, Scott (May 15, 1998). \\"Marjory, we loved you so.\\" The Miami Herald; Commentary. When she was six, Marjory's parents separated. Her father endured a series of failed entrepreneurial ventures and the instability caused her mother to move them abruptly to the Trefethen family house in Taunton, Massachusetts. She lived there with her mother, aunt, and grandparents, who did not get along well and consistently spoke ill of her father, to her dismay.Davis, p. 95. Her mother, whom Marjory characterized as \\"high-strung\\", was committed to a mental sanitarium in Providence several times. Her parents' separation and the contentiousness of her mother's family caused her to suffer from night terrors.Douglas, pp. 47, 48. She credited her tenuous upbringing with making her \\"a skeptic and a dissenter\\" for the rest of her life.Douglas, p. 50. As a youth, Marjory found solace in reading, and eventually, she began to write. At sixteen she contributed to the most popular children's publication of the day, St. Nicholas Magazine‚Äîalso the first publisher of 20th-century writers F. Scott Fitzgerald, Rachel Carson, and William Faulkner‚Äîwith a puzzle titled \\"Double Beheadings and Double Curtailings\\". In 1907, she was awarded a prize by the Boston Herald for \\"An Early Morning Paddle\\", a story about a boy who watches a sunrise from a canoe.Davis, p. 100. As her mother's mental health deteriorated, Marjory took on more responsibilities, eventually managing some of the family finances and gaining a maturity imposed upon her by circumstance.Douglas, pp. 53‚Äì54. =Education and marriage= Marjory Stoneman in her senior year at Wellesley College Marjory left for college in 1908, despite grave misgivings about her mother's mental state. Her aunt and grandmother shared her concerns, but recognized that she needed to leave in order to begin her own life.Douglas, p. 69. She was a straight-A student at Wellesley College,\\"Marjory Stoneman Douglas.\\" Friends of the Everglades website. Retrieved on December 17, 2007. graduating with a BA in English in 1912. She found particular success in a class on elocution, and joined the first suffrage club with six of her classmates.Douglas, pp. 77‚Äì78. She was elected Class Orator but was unable to fulfill the office since she was already involved in other activities. During her senior year while visiting home, her mother showed her a lump on her breast. Marjory arranged the surgery to have it removed. After the graduation ceremony, her aunt informed her it had metastasized, and within months her mother was dead. The family left the funeral arrangements up to Marjory.Douglas, pp. 78‚Äì82. After drifting with college friends through a few jobs to which she did not feel well-suited, Marjory Stoneman met Kenneth Douglas in 1914. She was so impressed with his manners and surprised at the attention he showed her that she married him within three months. He portrayed himself as a newspaper editor, and was 30 years her senior, but the marriage quickly failed when it became apparent he was a con artist. The true extent of his duplicity Marjory did not entirely reveal, despite her honesty in all other matters. Douglas was married to Marjory while already married to another woman.Davis, pp. 158‚Äì159. While he spent six months in jail for passing a bad check, she remained faithful to him. His scheme to scam her absent father out of money worked in Marjory's favor when it attracted Frank Stoneman's attention.Douglas, pp. 86, 89.\\"Marjory Stoneman Douglas.\\" Newsmakers 1998, Issue 4. Gale Group, 1998.Davis, pp. 161‚Äì162. Marjory's uncle persuaded her to move to Miami and end the marriage. In the fall of 1915, Marjory Stoneman Douglas left New England to be reunited with her father, whom she had not seen since her parents' separation. Shortly before that, her father had married Lillius (\\"Lilla\\") Eleanor Shine, a great-great-granddaughter of Thomas Jefferson (her grandfather was Francis W. Eppes). Marjory later wrote that Shine \\"remained my first and best friend all my life in Florida.\\" After moving to Florida in 1915, Marjory rarely returned to Massachusetts, but she retained affection for it; her 1987 memoir Voice of the River, is dedicated \\"To Massachusetts, with love.\\"Douglas, Marjory Stoneman, Voice of the River: An Autobiography with John Rothchild, Sarasota, FL: Pineapple Press, Inc., 1987, Dedication Page (facing copyright page). Writing career =The Miami Herald= Douglas arrived in South Florida when fewer than 5,000 people lived in Miami and it was \\"no more than a glorified railroad terminal\\".Douglas, p. 103. Her father, Frank Stoneman, was the first publisher of the paper that later became The Miami Herald. Stoneman passionately opposed the governor of Florida, Napoleon Bonaparte Broward, and his attempts to drain the Everglades. He infuriated Broward so much that when Stoneman won an election for circuit judge, Broward refused to validate the election, so Stoneman was referred to as \\"Judge\\" for the rest of his life without performing the duties of one.Douglas, pp. 98‚Äì99. Douglas joined the newspaper's staff in 1915. She began as a society columnist writing about tea parties and society events, but news was so slow she later admitted to making up some of her stories: \\"Somebody would say, 'Who's that Mrs. T.Y. Washrag you've got in your column?' And I would say, 'Oh, you know, I don't think she's been here very long'\\". When her father went on vacation less than a year after her arrival in Miami, he left her the responsibility of the editorial page. She developed a rivalry with an editor at The Miami Metropolis whose greater familiarity with Miami history gave her cause to make fun of Douglas in writing. Her father scolded her to check her facts better.Douglas, p. 109. Douglas was given an assignment in 1916 to write a story on the first woman from Miami to join the US Naval Reserve. When the woman did not show up for the interview, Douglas herself joined the Navy as a Yeoman (F) first class. It did not suit her; she disliked rising early and her superiors did not appreciate her correcting their grammar, so she requested a discharge and joined the American Red Cross, which stationed her in Paris.Davis, pp. 241‚Äì245. She witnessed the tumultuous celebrations on the Rue de Rivoli when the Armistice was signedDouglas, pp. 118‚Äì119. and cared for war refugees; seeing them displaced and in a state of shock, she wrote, \\"helped me understand the plight of refugees in Miami sixty years later\\".Douglas, p. 116. After the war, Douglas served as assistant editor at The Miami Herald. She gained some renown for her daily column, \\"The Galley\\", becoming something of a local celebrity. She amassed a devoted readership and attempted to begin each column with a poem. \\"The Galley\\" was topical and went in any direction Douglas chose. She promoted responsible urban planning when Miami saw a population boom of 100,000 people in a decade. She wrote supporting women's suffrage, civil rights, and better sanitation while opposing Prohibition and foreign trade tariffs.Davis, pp. 276‚Äì277. Some of the stories she wrote spoke of the region's wealth as being in its \\"inevitable development\\", and she supplemented her income with $100 a week from writing copy advertisements that praised the development of South Florida, something she would reconsider later in her life.Grunwald, p. 182. In the early 1920s she wrote \\"Martin Tabert of North Dakota is Walking Florida Now\\", a ballad lamenting the death of a 22-year-old vagrant who was beaten to death in a labor camp. It was printed in The Miami Herald, and read aloud during a session of the Florida Legislature, which passed a law banning convict leasing in large part due to her writing. \\"I think that's the single most important thing I was ever able to accomplish as a result of something I've written\\", she wrote in her autobiography.Douglas, p. 134. =Freelance writer= After quitting the newspaper in 1923, Douglas worked as a freelance writer. From 1920 to 1990, Douglas published 109 fiction articles and stories. One of her first stories was sold to the pulp fiction magazine Black Mask for $600 (equivalent to $ in ). Forty of her stories were published in The Saturday Evening Post; one, \\"Story of a Homely Woman\\", was reprinted in 1937 in the Post's best short stories compilation.Mason, Kathy. \\"Marjory Stoneman Douglas.\\" The Scribner Encyclopedia of American Lives, Volume 5: 1997‚Äì1999. Charles Scribner's Sons, 2002. Recurring settings in her fiction were South Florida, the Caribbean, and Europe during World War I. Her protagonists were often independent, quirky women or youthful underdogs who encountered social or natural injustices.Davis, pp. 313‚Äì315. The people and animals of the Everglades served as subjects for some of her earliest writings. \\"Plumes\\", originally published in the Saturday Evening Post in 1930, was based on the murder of Guy Bradley, an Audubon Society game warden, by poachers. \\"Wings\\" was a nonfiction story, also first appearing in the Post in 1931, that addressed the slaughter of Everglades wading birds for their feathers. Her story \\"Peculiar Treasure of a King\\" was a second-place finalist in the O. Henry Award competition in 1928. During the 1930s, she was commissioned to write a pamphlet supporting a botanical garden called \\"An argument for the establishment of a tropical botanical garden in South Florida.\\" Its success caused her to be in demand at garden clubs where she delivered speeches throughout the area, then to serve on the board to support the Fairchild Garden. She called the garden \\"one of the greatest achievements for the entire area\\".Douglas, p. 176. Douglas became involved with the Miami Theater, and wrote some one-act plays that were fashionable in the 1930s. One, \\"The Gallows Gate\\", was about an argument between a mother and father regarding the character of their son who is sentenced to hang. She got the idea from her father, who had witnessed hangings when he lived in the West and was unnerved by the creaking sound of the rope bearing the weight of the hanging body. The play won a state competition, and eventually $500 in a national competition after it was written into three acts.Douglas, p. 183. With William W. Muir, husband of reporter Helen Muir, she authored \\"Storm Warnings\\", a play loosely based on the life of mobster Al Capone. Some of Capone's henchmen showed up at the theater, \\"add[ing] an extra tingle for the audience that night\\", though no actual problems arose.Muir, Helen (1990) [1953]. Miami, U.S.A. Miami: The Pickering Press, p. 167. Douglas wrote the foreword to the Work Projects Administration's guide to Miami and environs, published in 1941 as part of the Federal Writers' Project's American Guide Series. Retrieved on June 15, 2015. Douglas served as the book review editor of The Miami Herald from 1942 to 1949, and as editor for the University of Miami Press from 1960 to 1963. She released her first novel, Road to the Sun, in 1952. She wrote four novels, and several nonfiction books on regional topics including Florida birdwatching and David Fairchild, a biologist who imagined a botanical park in Miami. Her autobiography, Marjory Stoneman Douglas: Voice of the River, was written with John Rothchild in 1987. She had been working on a book about W. H. Hudson for years, traveling to Argentina and England several times. It was incomplete when she died in 1998.Leposky, Rosalie (1997). \\"Marjory Stoneman Douglas: A Bibliography.\\" Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings Journal of Florida Literature 8 pp. 55‚Äì73. =The Everglades: River of Grass= Early in the 1940s Douglas was approached by a publisher to contribute to the Rivers of America Series by writing about the Miami River. Unimpressed with it, she called the Miami River about \\"an inch long\\", but in researching it became more interested in the Everglades and persuaded the publisher to allow her to write about them instead. She spent five years researching what little was known about the ecology and history of the Everglades and South Florida. Douglas spent time with geologist Garald Parker, who discovered that South Florida's sole freshwater source was the Biscayne Aquifer, and it was filled by the Everglades. Parker confirmed the name of the book that has since become the nickname for the Everglades when Douglas, trying to capture the Everglades' essence, asked if she could safely call the fresh water flowing from Lake Okeechobee a river of grass.Davis, pp. 355‚Äì358. The Everglades: River of Grass was published in 1947 and sold out of its first printing in a month. The book's first line, \\"There are no other Everglades in the world\\", has been called the \\"most famous passage ever written about the Everglades\\",Grunwald, p. 205. and the line welcomes visitors to the Everglades National Park website.\\"Everglades National Park.\\" National Park Service. Retrieved on December 17, 2007. Douglas characterized the Everglades as an ecosystem surrounding a river worthy of protection, inescapably connected to South Florida's people and cultures.Davis, p. 360. She outlined its imminent disappearance in the last chapter, \\"The Eleventh Hour\\": > Cattlemen's grass fires roared uncontrolled. Cane-field fires spread > crackling and hissing in the saw grass in vast waves and pillars and > billowing mountains of heavy, cream-colored, purple-shadowed smoke. Training > planes flying over the Glades dropped bombs or cigarette butts, and the > fires exploded in the hearts of the drying hammocks and raced on before > every wind leaving only blackness ... There was no water in the canals with > which to fight [the fires] ... The sweet water the rock had held was gone or > had shrunk far down into its strange holes and cleavages.Douglas (1947), pp. > 374‚Äì375. The Everglades: River of Grass galvanized people to protect the Everglades and has been compared to Rachel Carson's 1962 expos√© of the harmful effects of DDT, Silent Spring; both books are \\"groundbreaking calls to action that made citizens and politicians take notice\\".Hauserman, Julie (October 14, 2007). \\"Paradise down the drain.\\" St. Petersburg Times (Florida); p. 9L.

The Christian Science Monitor wrote of it in 1997, \\"Today her book is not only a classic of environmental literature, it also reads like a blueprint for what conservationists are hailing as the most extensive environmental restoration project ever undertaken anywhere in the world\\".Richey, Warren (September 3, 1997). \\"Reviving Florida's Fragile 'River of Grass'.\\" Christian Science Monitor; p. 4. The downside of the book's impact, according to one writer addressing restoration of the Everglades, is that her metaphor of a River of Grass is so predominant that the complex web of ecosystems within the Everglades is oversimplified. David McCally wrote that despite Douglas's \\"appreciation of the complexity of the environmental system\\" she described, popular conception of the Everglades shared by people who have not read the book overshadows her detailed explanations.McCally, pp. 179‚Äì180. Activism Women's suffrage was an early interest of Douglas, and although she tended to shy away from polemics in her early work at The Miami Herald, on her third day as a society columnist, she chose suffrage and began to focus on writing about women in leadership positions.Davis, pp. 229‚Äì231. In 1917, she traveled with Mary Baird Bryan, William Jennings Bryan's wife, and two other women to Tallahassee to speak in support of women's right to vote. Douglas was not impressed with the reception the group got from the Florida Legislature. She wrote about her experience later: \\"All four of us spoke to a joint committee wearing our best hats. Talking to them was like talking to graven images. They never paid attention to us at all.\\" Douglas was able to vote for the first time after she returned from Europe in 1920. Using her influence at The Miami Herald, Douglas wrote columns about poverty: > You can have the most beautiful city in the world as appearance goes, the > streets may be clean and shining, the avenues broad and tree lined, the > public buildings dignified, adequate and well kept ... but if you have a > weak or inadequate health department, or a public opinion lax on the > subject, all the splendors of your city will have not value. In 1948 Douglas served on the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Committee, with a friend of hers named Elizabeth Virrick, who was horrified to learn that no running water or sewers were connected to the racially segregated part of Coconut Grove. They helped pass a law requiring all homes in Miami to have toilets and bathtubs. In the two years it took them to get the referendum passed, they worked to set up a loan operation for the black residents of Coconut Grove, who borrowed the money interest-free to pay for the plumbing work. Douglas noted that all of the money loaned was repaid.\\"Elizabeth Virrick's work in Coconut Grove's black community: Interview with Marjory Stoneman Douglas.\\" Florida International University. June 16, 1983. Retrieved on January 5, 2008. Douglas claims in this oral history that the Committee served in the early 1920s. However, according to the websites of Coconut Grove Cares‚Äîan updated name for the organization‚Äîand the Junior League of Miami, the Committee did not begin its service until 1948. =Everglades work= Stoneman Douglas became involved in the Everglades in the 1920s, when she joined the board of the Everglades Tropical National Park Committee, a group led by Ernest F. Coe and dedicated to the idea of making a national park in the Everglades. By the 1960s, the Everglades were in imminent danger of disappearing forever because of gross mismanagement in the name of progress and real estate and agricultural development. Encouraged to get involved by the leaders of environmental groups, in 1969‚Äîat the age of 79‚ÄîDouglas founded Friends of the Everglades to protest the construction of a jetport in the Big Cypress portion of the Everglades. She justified her involvement saying, \\"It is a woman's business to be interested in the environment. It's an extended form of housekeeping.\\" She toured the state giving \\"hundreds of ringing denunciations\\" of the airport project,Grunwald, pp. 257‚Äì258. and increased membership of Friends of the Everglades to 3,000 within three years. She ran the public information operation full-time from her home and encountered hostility from the jetport's developers and backers, who called her a \\"damn butterfly chaser\\". President Richard Nixon, however, scrapped funding for the project due to the efforts of many Everglades watchdog groups. Douglas continued her activism and focused her efforts on restoring the Everglades after declaring that \\"Conservation is now a dead word ... You can't conserve what you haven't got.\\"Davis, p. 513. Her criticism was directed at two entities she considered were doing the most damage to the Everglades. A coalition of sugarcane growers, named Big Sugar, she accused of polluting Lake Okeechobee by pumping water tainted with chemicals, human waste, and garbage back into the lake, which served as the fresh water source for the Miami metropolitan area.\\"Pollution caused by growing sugar in Florida.\\" Lecture by Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Fort Lauderdale, Florida International University. May 6, 1983. Retrieved on January 28, 2008. She compared Florida sugarcane agriculture to sugarcane grown in the West Indies, which, she claimed, was more environmentally sound, had a longer harvest cycle less harmful to soil nutrients, and was less expensive for consumers due to the higher sugar content.\\"Damages caused by the Army Corps of Engineers and Big Sugar.\\" Lecture by Marjory Stoneman Douglas in Fort Lauderdale\\", Florida International University. May 6, 1983. Retrieved on January 26, 2008. Besides Big Sugar, Douglas spoke about the damage the Army Corps of Engineers was doing to the Everglades by diverting the natural flow of water. The Corps was responsible for constructing more than of canals to divert water away from the Everglades after 1947. When the Central & South Florida Project (C&SF;), run by former members of the Corps of Engineers, was proposed to assist the Everglades, Douglas initially gave it her approval, as it promised to deliver much-needed water to the shrinking Everglades. However, in application, the project instead diverted more water away from the Everglades, changed water schedules to meet sugarcane farmers' irrigation needs, and flat-out refused to release water to Everglades National Park, until much of the land was unrecognizable.Grunwald, p. 241. \\"What a liar I turned out to be!\\" remarked Douglas, then suggested the motivation behind all the digging and diversion in saying, \\"Their mommies obviously never let them play with mud pies, so now they take it out on us by playing with cement\\".Grunwald, pp. 241, 243. Douglas was giving a speech addressing the harmful practices of the Army Corps of Engineers when the colonel in attendance dropped his pen on the floor. As he was stooping to pick it up, Douglas stopped her speech and said to him, \\"Colonel! You can crawl under that table and hide, but you can't get away from me!\\"Hauserman, Julie (April 19, 1999). \\"Leaving an environmental hot seat.\\" St. Petersburg Times (Florida); p. 1B. In 1973, Douglas attended a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: > Mrs. Douglas was half the size of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark > glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett > O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped > slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of > our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had > the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to > tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the > lawyers on both sides. I wonder if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes > ... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. > This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak. Douglas was not well received by some audiences. She opposed the drainage of a suburb in Dade County named East Everglades. After the county approved building permits in the Everglades, the land flooded as it had for centuries. When homeowners demanded the Army Corps of Engineers drain their neighborhoods, she was the only opposing voice. At the hearing in 1983, she was booed, jeered, and shouted at by the audience of residents. \\"Can't you boo any louder than that?\\" she chided, eventually making them laugh. \\"Look. I'm an old lady. I've been here since eight o'clock. It's now eleven. I've got all night, and I'm used to the heat,\\" she told them.Davis, p. 533. Later, she wrote, \\"They're all good souls‚Äîthey just shouldn't be out there.\\"Douglas, p. 232. Dade County commissioners eventually decided not to drain. Florida Governor Lawton Chiles explained her impact, saying, \\"Marjory was the first voice to really wake a lot of us up to what we were doing to our quality of life. She was not just a pioneer of the environmental movement, she was a prophet, calling out to us to save the environment for our children and our grandchildren.\\" =Other causes= Douglas also served as a charter member of the first American Civil Liberties Union chapter organized in the South in the 1950s. She lent her support to the Equal Rights Amendment, speaking to the legislature in Tallahassee urging them to ratify it. In the 1980s Douglas lent her support to the Florida Rural Legal Services, a group that worked to protect migrant farm workers who were centered on Belle Glade, and who were primarily employed by the sugarcane industry. She wrote to Governor Bob Graham in 1985 to encourage him to assess the conditions the migrant workers endured. The same year, Douglas approached the Dade County School Board and insisted that the Biscayne Nature Center, which had been housed in hot dog stands, needed a building of its own. The center received a portable building until 1991 when the Florida Department of Education endowed $1.8 million for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center in Crandon Park.Long, Theodora. \\"Housed in a hot dog stand.\\" Marjory Stoneman Douglas Biscayne Nature Center.

Douglas co-founded the Friends of the Miami-Dade Public Libraries with her longtime friend Helen Muir, and served as its first president.\\"The Helen Muir Collection.\\" University of Miami Library Special Collections. Retrieved on November 30, 2014. Personal life =Religious views= Although Douglas grew up in an Episcopal household, she described herself as agnostic throughout her life, and forbade any religious ceremony at her memorial.Fichter, Margaria (May 14, 1998). \\"Pioneering environmentalist Marjory Stoneman Douglas dies at 108.\\" The Miami Herald; Domestic news. Douglas tied her agnosticism to her unanswered prayers when her mother was dying.Davis, Jack (Summer 2001). \\"Green Awakening: Social activism and the evolution of Marjory Stoneman Douglas's Environmental Consciousness.\\" The Florida Historical Quarterly, 80 (1), pp. 43‚Äì77. However, she credited the motivation for her support of women's suffrage to her Quaker paternal grandparents whose dedication to the abolition of slavery she admired, and proudly claimed Levi Coffin, an organizer of the Underground Railroad, was her great-great-uncle.Davis, Jack (January 2003). \\"'Conservation is now a dead word': Marjory Stoneman Douglas and the transformation of American environmentalism.\\" Environmental History 8 (1) pp. 53‚Äì76. She wrote that his wife was a friend of Harriet Beecher Stowe, and had provided Stowe with the story of Eliza in Uncle Tom's Cabin fleeing slavery because Douglas' great- great-aunt took care of Eliza and her infant after their escape.Douglas, p. 37. Frank Stoneman grew up in a Quaker colony, and Douglas maintained he kept touches of his upbringing throughout his life, even after converting to Episcopalianism. Writer Jack Davis and neighbor Helen Muir suggest this Quaker influence was behind Douglas' use of \\"Friends\\" in naming the organizations Friends of the Everglades and Friends of the Miami-Dade Public Libraries. =Mental health= As a child, Douglas was very close with her mother after her parents' separation. She witnessed her mother's emotional unraveling that caused her to be institutionalized, and even long after her mother returned to live with her, she exhibited bizarre, childlike behaviors.Douglas, pp. 56‚Äì57. Following her mother's death, her relocation to Miami, and her displeasure in working as the assistant editor at The Miami Herald, in the 1920s, she suffered the first of three nervous breakdowns.Byers, Stephen (January 3, 1999). \\"The Lives They Lived: Marjory Stoneman Douglas.\\" The New York Times; p. 46\\\\. Retrieved on May 2, 2008. Douglas suggested she had what she referred to as \\"blank periods\\" before and during her marriage, but they were brief. She connected these lapses to her mother's insanity.Douglas, p. 167. She eventually quit the newspaper, but after her father's death in 1941 she suffered a third and final breakdown, when her neighbors found her roaming the neighborhood one night screaming. She realized she had a \\"father complex\\", explaining it by saying, \\"Having been brought up without him all those years, and then coming back and finding him so sympathetic had a powerful effect\\".Douglas, p. 188. =Personal habits= Regardless of her dedication to the preservation of the Everglades, Douglas admitted the time she spent actually there was sporadic, driving there for occasional picnics. \\"To be a friend of the Everglades is not necessarily to spend time wandering around out there ... It's too buggy, too wet, too generally inhospitable\\", she wrote. Instead, she understood that the health of the environment indicated the general well-being of humanity. Despite Douglas' demure appearance‚Äîshe stood at and weighed , and was always immaculately dressed in pearls, a floppy straw hat and gloves‚Äîshe had an uncanny ability to get her point across. She was known for speaking in perfect, precise paragraphs, and was respected for her dedication and knowledge of her subjects; even her critics admitted her authority on the Everglades. Jeff Klinkenberg, a reporter for the St. Petersburg Times who interviewed and wrote several stories about Douglas, wrote of her, \\"She had a tongue like a switchblade and the moral authority to embarrass bureaucrats and politicians and make things happen.\\" Douglas was known for haughtily dismissing reporters who had not read her books and asked uninformed questions.Klinkenberg, Jeff. \\"Though expected, the loss of a hero still stings.\\" St. Petersburg Times (Florida); p. 6A. She enjoyed drinking Scotch and sherry; as friend and neighbor Helen Muir remembered her, \\"She would come up and have a sherry, and then I would walk her home, and then she'd walk me back, and we would have another sherry. What fun she was.\\" Novelist Hervey Allen called Marjory Stoneman Douglas and Muir \\"the Stewart Avenue Gang\\".Muir, Helen (2004). Baby Grace Sees the Cow: A Memoir. The Prologue Society (Miami). The two were fond of having sherry together and gossiping, but those moments were followed by serious talk of the future of libraries, and the role of women in South Florida. They were confidants, and often shared their work with one another. Douglas never learned to drive and never owned a car. Her house also had no air conditioning, electric stove, or dishwasher.Douglas, pp. 16, 17. She was attached to several men after her divorce, counting one of them as the reason she enlisted in the Red Cross, as he had already gone to France as a soldier. However, she said she did not believe in extramarital sex and would not have dishonored her father by being promiscuous. She told Klinkenberg in 1992, frankly, that she had not had sex since her divorce, saying \\"I wasn't a wild woman\\".Klinkenberg, Jeff (August 21, 2006). \\"Conserving the conservationist.\\" St. Petersburg Times (Florida); p. 1E. However, she was fond of saying she used the emotion and energy instead on her work.Douglas, p. 85. \\"People don't seem to realize that the energy that goes into sex, all the emotion that surrounds it, can be well employed in other ways\\", she wrote in her autobiography.Douglas, p. 128. Awards, death, and legacy Marjory Stoneman Douglas Building, Tallahassee, Florida, headquarters of Florida Department of Environmental Protection =Honors= Douglas began accruing honors in her early days writing for The Miami Herald. In the 1980s, the awards became more prestigious, and her reactions to them mixed. The Florida Department of Natural Resources (now the Florida Department of Environmental Protection) named its headquarters in Tallahassee after her in 1980, which she considered a dubious honor. She told a friend she would have rather seen the Everglades restored than her name on a building. During her polite acceptance speech, she railed against Ronald Reagan and the then- Secretary of the Interior James Watt for their lackluster approach to environmental conservation.Davis, pp. 553‚Äì554. In 1986 the National Parks Conservation Association established the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Award, which \\"honor(s) individuals who often must go to great lengths to advocate and fight for the protection of the National Park System\\".\\"Grand Canyon Advocate Receives National Parks Award\\" (Press release).

Despite blindness and diminished hearing, Douglas continued to be active into her second century, and was honored with a visit from Queen Elizabeth II, to whom Douglas gave a signed copy of The Everglades: River of Grass in 1991.Davis, p. 572. Instead of gifts and celebrations, Douglas asked that trees be planted on her birthday, resulting in over 100,000 planted trees across the state and a bald cypress on the lawn of the governor's mansion. The South Florida Water Management District began removing exotic plants that had taken hold in the Everglades when Douglas turned 102.Davis, pp. 572‚Äì574. In 1993, when she was 103, President Bill Clinton awarded Douglas the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor granted by the United States of America. The citation for the medal read, > Marjory Stoneman Douglas personifies passionate commitment. Her crusade to > preserve and restore the Everglades has enhanced our Nation's respect for > our precious environment, reminding all of us of nature's delicate balance. > Grateful Americans honor the 'Grandmother of the Glades' by following her > splendid example in safeguarding America's beauty and splendor for > generations to come. Douglas donated her medal to Wellesley College. Most of the others she received she stored at her home.

Retrieved on December 17, 2007. John Rothchild declared her a feminist before the word existed. Upon hearing that she was to be inducted, she questioned, \\"Why should they have a Women's Hall of Fame, as I heard they wanted to put me in the other day? Why not a Citizen's Hall of Fame?\\"Douglas, p. 23. Douglas was included in a tribute to pioneering women when television character Lisa Simpson made a papier-m√¢ch√© bust of her with Georgia O'Keeffe and Susan B. Anthony in an early episode of The Simpsons.Davis, p. 556. Some of Douglas's stories were collected by University of Florida professor Kevin McCarthy in two edited collections: Nine Florida Stories in 1990 and A River In Flood in 1998. McCarthy wrote that he collected Douglas's short stories because most people in the 1990s were well aware of her as an environmentalist but did not know about her career as a freelance writer. \\"Probably no other person has been as important to the environmental well-being of Florida than this little lady from Coconut Grove\\", McCarthy wrote in the introduction to A River in Flood.McCarthy, Kevin (1998). \\"Introduction\\".

Early life He was born in 1751 in Albany County, New York to Harmen Gansevoort (1712‚Äì1801) and Magdalena Douw Gansevoort (1718‚Äì1796), both from prominent Dutch families. He was the younger brother of Brig. Gen. Peter Gansevoort (1749‚Äì1812). Gansevoort's ancestors had been in Albany since 1660, when it was the Dutch colony of Fort Orange, and Harmen Harmense Gansevoort (ca. 1634‚Äì1709) owned a brewery and farms. His brother's son, Peter Gansevoort, Herman Gansevoort (1779‚Äì1862) built the Gansevoort Mansion in 1813 on his father's tract at Gansevoort in Saratoga County, New York. His father was the third of his family's generation in America, who were prominent brewers and merchants in Albany. His mother was descended from the Van Rensselaer family as her mother, Anna Van Rensselaer, was a daughter of Hendrick van Rensselaer (1667‚Äì1740), who had married Peter Douw. In addition, his first cousin, Leonard Gansevoort (1754‚Äì1834), an Albany lawyer and alderman, was married to Maria Van Rensselaer (1760‚Äì1841), the daughter of Col. Kiliaen van Rensselaer (1717‚Äì1781), the granddaughter of Hendrick van Rensselaer and the sister of Henry K. Van Rensselaer (1744‚Äì1816), Philip Kiliaen van Rensselaer (1747‚Äì1798), and Killian K. Van Rensselaer (1763‚Äì1845). Career After the outbreak of the Revolutionary War, he became a member of the Albany Committee of Correspondence serving as treasurer until November 1775. When the 2nd New York Provincial Congress convened in New York City on December 6, 1775, he was one of the twelve deputies elected by the Albany Committee. He wrote to his brother, Peter on October 31, 1775, stating: > \\"Dr Brother > I can hardly express my Distress upon receiving a Letter from Mr James Van > Rensselaer acquainting me with your indisposition and that you in > consequence thereof had been obliged to leave Chanblee and that you was then > in Coll: Biddels Camp on the North side of St John's; every thing seem'd to > consire to confirm me in the Opinion that you must have been very ill you > cannot be ignorant of the Emotions in my Breast when you consider that > Fraternal Affection which has always subsisted between us, and in what > Manner I must have also felt when prompted by Duty I communicated the > Contents of the Letter to our Joint Parents, I was oblig'd to meliorate the > News by telling them that your indisposition was the Fever Ague but do > assure you that upon reading the Letter from the same Gent. to Mr Philip Van > Rensselaer that tho' you was then yet pretty Weak you was greatly recovered, > I seem'd to be rais'd from the lowest Abyss of dispondence to the highest > pinnacle of Hope and I will leave you to reflect how industrious I was to > communicate it to the old people - I beg Dear Brother as you Love your > Friends who are under the greatest uneasiness yet that you will write us a > Line if you are able, and if not procure some one to write for you - and beg > further that if you are not recovered on receipt of this that you will apply > for leave to come down and write me before you set out that I may meet you > on your Way - I should have been up with you already If I could possibly > have obtained leave of Hetty > We are well I am Your loving Brother > Leonard Gansevoort > Albany Octr 31 1774 > To Peter Gansevoort Junr Esqr [Provincial Camp at St Johns]\\" He was also appointed to the 3rd and 4th Provincial Congresses in 1776 and 1777, where the Constitution of the State of New York was adopted on April 20, 1777. From April 18, 1777 to May 14, 1777, he was the president of the New York Provincial Congress committee of safety.Launitz-Schurer, Leopold, Loyal Whigs and Revolutionaries, The making of the revolution in New York, 1765-1776 Following the end of Revolution in 1789, he bought a country house and estate known as Whitehall, which was located a mile and a half from Albany, from John Bradstreet Schuyler, the son of Philip Schuyler. Gansevoort was known for his entertainment of many prominent state and national political figures. In 1778 and 1779, he served as a member of the New York State Assembly. Early in his political career he was aligned with the patrician group of the large estates owners and commercial interests, but later became involved with the early evolution of the Democratic Party in New York. He served in the State Assembly again from 1787‚Äì1788 and in the State Senate from 1791‚Äì1793 and 1796‚Äì1802, where he was chairman of the committee, as a Federalist. In 1794, he was appointed a colonel in the New York militia. From 1794 to 1797 he was a judge in Albany. From 1799 to 1810, he was a judge of the court of probates. Personal life On April 10, 1770, he married Hester Cuyler (1748‚Äì1826), the daughter of Abraham Cuyler, Jr. (1713‚Äì1749), a cousin of Abraham Cuyler, and Jannetje Beekman (1719‚Äì1798), a descendant of Wilhelmus Beekman (1623‚Äì1707). Together, they had: * Magdalena Gansevoort (b. 1771) * Catharina Gansevoort (b. 1772) * Abraham Cuyler Gansevoort (b. 1775) * Magdalena Gansevoort (1777‚Äì1863), who married Jacob Ten Eyck (1771‚Äì1862), on March 6, 1795, the son of Abraham Ten Eyck and grandson of Mayor Jacob Coenraedt Ten Eyck. * Catharine Cuyler Gansevoort (1789‚Äì1853), who married Teunis Van Vechten (1785‚Äì1859), nephew of Abraham Van Vechten He died in 1810 at home in Albany and was buried in Albany Rural Cemetery. =Descendants= Through his daughter, Magdalena, he was the grandfather of Hester Gansevoort Ten Eyck (1796‚Äì1861), Abraham Gansevoort Ten Eyck (1798‚Äì1830), Leonard Gansevoort Ten Eyck (1801‚Äì1881), Jacob L. Ten Eyck (1804‚Äì1875), and Herman Gansevoort Ten Eyck (1806‚Äì1881), and Peter Gansevoort Ten Eyck (1810‚Äì1891). Through his daughter, Catharine, he was the grandfather of Elizabeth Ann Van Vechten (1812‚Äì1812), Leonard Gansevoort Van Vechten (1813‚Äì1837), Hester Elizabeth Van Vechten Trotter (1815‚Äì1881), Teunis Van Vechten (1819‚Äì1859), Cuyler Van Vechten (1823‚Äì1825), and Cuyler Van Vechten (1830‚Äì1875).

History NeoModus was founded in November, 1999 by a high school student named Jonathan Hess. NeoModus operated between 2000 and 2005. Along with Napster, it was part of the first wave of peer-to-peer software. It was principally managed and developed by Jon Hess. At its peak, it shared 15 petabytes of information with 300,000 simultaneous users, and had triple the data of Kazaa, Morpheus, and Grokster combined. Software NeoModus Direct Connect was a community-driven type of network and client. Chat capabilities were a central part of the client, and the users of the client exerted a direct management of the network and the files they shared. Users often created smaller, specialized hubs catering to particular user groups or types of files, and these hubs were generally much smaller than other types of file-sharing networks. The hubs, at first, generally ranged from 0 - 300 users, but later on hubs with 2000 users were not uncommon. NeoModus Direct Connect inspired the creation of open- source versions of the client, such as Open Direct Connect and later DC++. DC++ itself has several specialized spin-off open-source versions as well, such as BCDC++ and StrongDC++, which are refined with features particular to user groups, such as filters, language packs, and search capabilities.

Generally, a honeypot consists of data (for example, in a network site) that appears to be a legitimate part of the site that seems to contain information or a resource of value to attackers, but actually, is isolated and monitored and enables blocking or analyzing the attackers. This is similar to police sting operations, colloquially known as \\"baiting\\" a suspect. Diagram of an information system honeypot Types Honeypots can be classified based on their deployment (use/action) and based on their level of involvement. Based on deployment, honeypots may be classified as * production honeypots * research honeypots Production honeypots are easy to use, capture only limited information, and are used primarily by corporations. Production honeypots are placed inside the production network with other production servers by an organization to improve their overall state of security. Normally, production honeypots are low-interaction honeypots, which are easier to deploy. They give less information about the attacks or attackers than research honeypots. Research honeypots are run to gather information about the motives and tactics of the black hat community targeting different networks. These honeypots do not add direct value to a specific organization; instead, they are used to research the threats that organizations face and to learn how to better protect against those threats. Research honeypots are complex to deploy and maintain, capture extensive information, and are used primarily by research, military, or government organizations. Based on design criteria, honeypots can be classified as: * pure honeypots * high-interaction honeypots * low-interaction honeypots Pure honeypots are full-fledged production systems. The activities of the attacker are monitored by using a bug tap that has been installed on the honeypot's link to the network. No other software needs to be installed. Even though a pure honeypot is useful, stealthiness of the defense mechanisms can be ensured by a more controlled mechanism. High- interaction honeypots imitate the activities of the production systems that host a variety of services and, therefore, an attacker may be allowed a lot of services to waste their time. By employing virtual machines, multiple honeypots can be hosted on a single physical machine. Therefore, even if the honeypot is compromised, it can be restored more quickly. In general, high- interaction honeypots provide more security by being difficult to detect, but they are expensive to maintain. If virtual machines are not available, one physical computer must be maintained for each honeypot, which can be exorbitantly expensive. Example: Honeynet. Low-interaction honeypots simulate only the services frequently requested by attackers. Since they consume relatively few resources, multiple virtual machines can easily be hosted on one physical system, the virtual systems have a short response time, and less code is required, reducing the complexity of the virtual system's security. Example: Honeyd. = Deception technology = Recently, a new market segment called deception technology has emerged using basic honeypot technology with the addition of advanced automation for scale. Deception technology addresses the automated deployment of honeypot resources over a large commercial enterprise or government institution. = Malware honeypots = Malware honeypots are used to detect malware by exploiting the known replication and attack vectors of malware. Replication vectors such as USB flash drives can easily be verified for evidence of modifications, either through manual means or utilizing special-purpose honeypots that emulate drives. Malware increasingly is used to search for and steal cryptocurrencies. = Spam versions = Spammers abuse vulnerable resources such as open mail relays and open proxies. These are servers which accept e-mail from anyone on the Internet‚Äîincluding spammers‚Äîand send it to its destination. Some system administrators have created honeypot programs that masquerade as these abusable resources to discover spammer activity. There are several capabilities such honeypots provide to these administrators, and the existence of such fake abusable systems makes abuse more difficult or risky. Honeypots can be a powerful countermeasure to abuse from those who rely on very high volume abuse (e.g., spammers). These honeypots can reveal the abuser's IP address and provide bulk spam capture (which enables operators to determine spammers' URLs and response mechanisms). As described by M. Edwards at ITPRo Today: The apparent source may be another abused system. Spammers and other abusers may use a chain of such abused systems to make detection of the original starting point of the abuse traffic difficult. This in itself is indicative of the power of honeypots as anti-spam tools. In the early days of anti-spam honeypots, spammers, with little concern for hiding their location, felt safe testing for vulnerabilities and sending spam directly from their own systems. Honeypots made the abuse riskier and more difficult. Spam still flows through open relays, but the volume is much smaller than in 2001-02. While most spam originates in the U.S., spammers hop through open relays across political boundaries to mask their origin. Honeypot operators may use intercepted relay tests to recognize and thwart attempts to relay spam through their honeypots. \\"Thwart\\" may mean \\"accept the relay spam but decline to deliver it.\\" Honeypot operators may discover other details concerning the spam and the spammer by examining the captured spam messages. Open relay honeypots include Jackpot, written in Java by Jack Cleaver; smtpot.py, written in Python by Karl A. Krueger; and spamhole, written in C. The Bubblegum Proxypot is an open source honeypot (or \\"proxypot\\"). = Email trap = An email address that is not used for any other purpose than to receive spam can also be considered a spam honeypot. Compared with the term \\"spamtrap\\", the term \\"honeypot\\" might be more suitable for systems and techniques that are used to detect or counterattack probes. With a spamtrap, spam arrives at its destination \\"legitimately\\"‚Äîexactly as non-spam email would arrive. An amalgam of these techniques is Project Honey Pot, a distributed, open source project that uses honeypot pages installed on websites around the world. These honeypot pages disseminate uniquely tagged spamtrap email addresses and spammers can then be tracked‚Äîthe corresponding spam mail is subsequently sent to these spamtrap e-mail addresses. = Database honeypot = Databases often get attacked by intruders using SQL injection. As such activities are not recognized by basic firewalls, companies often use database firewalls for protection. Some of the available SQL database firewalls provide/support honeypot architectures so that the intruder runs against a trap database while the web application remains functional.  Detection  Just as honeypots are weapons against spammers, honeypot detection systems are spammer-employed counter-weapons. As detection systems would likely use unique characteristics of specific honeypots to identify them, such as the property-value pairs of default honeypot configuration, many honeypots in-use utilise a set of unique characteristics larger and more daunting to those seeking to detect and thereby identify them. This is an unusual circumstance in software; a situation in which \\"versionitis\\" (a large number of versions of the same software, all differing slightly from each other) can be beneficial. There's also an advantage in having some easy-to-detect honeypots deployed. Fred Cohen, the inventor of the Deception Toolkit, argues that every system running his honeypot should have a deception port which adversaries can use to detect the honeypot. Cohen believes that this might deter adversaries.  Risk of Honeypot  The goal of honeypots is to attract and engage attackers for a sufficiently long period to obtain high-level Indicators of Compromise (IoC) such as attack tools and Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). Thus, a honeypot needs to emulate essential services in the production network and grant the attacker the freedom to perform adversarial activities to increase its attractiveness to the attacker. Although the honeypot provides a controlled and monitored environment by applying the honeywall, attackers may still be able to use some honeypots as pivot nodes to penetrate production systems. This tradeoff between the honeypot attractiveness and the penetration risk has been investigated both qualitatively and quantitatively. The second risk of honeypots is that they may attract legitimate users due to a lack of communication in large-scale enterprise networks. For example, the security team who applies and monitors the honeypot may not disclose the honeypot location to all users in time due to the lack of communication or the prevention of insider threats. A game-theoretical model has been proposed to simultaneously incentivize adversarial users and disincentivize legitimate users for the honeypot access by exploiting the utility difference between two types of users.  Honey nets  Two or more honeypots on a network form a honey net. Typically, a honey net is used for monitoring a larger and/or more diverse network in which one honeypot may not be sufficient. Honey nets and honeypots are usually implemented as parts of larger network intrusion detection systems. A honey farm is a centralized collection of honeypots and analysis tools. The concept of the honey net first began in 1999 when Lance Spitzner, founder of the Honeynet Project, published the paper \\"To Build a Honeypot\\".  History  The metaphor of a bear being attracted to and stealing honey is common in many traditions, including Germanic, Celtic, and Slavic. A common Slavic word for the bear is medved \\"honey eater\\". The tradition of bears stealing honey has been passed down through stories and folklore, especially the well known Winnie the Pooh. The Brazilian folk tale \\"Boneca de pixe\\" tells of a stealing monkey being trapped by a puppet made of pitch. The earliest honeypot techniques are described in Clifford Stoll's 1989 book The Cuckoo's Egg. In 2017, Dutch police used honeypot techniques to track down users of the darknet market Hansa.

It took place predominantly on and around Ganghwa Island. The reason for the presence of the American land and naval force in Korea was to support an American diplomatic delegation sent to establish trade and political relations with the peninsular nation, to ascertain the fate of the merchant ship General Sherman, and to establish a treaty assuring aid for shipwrecked sailors. When Korean shore batteries attacked two American warships on June 1, a punitive expedition was launched 10 days later after the commanding American admiral failed to receive an official apology from the Koreans. The isolationist nature of the Joseon dynasty government and the assertiveness of the Americans led to a misunderstanding between the two parties that changed a diplomatic expedition into an armed conflict. On June 10, about 650 Americans landed and captured several forts, killing over 200 Korean troops with a loss of only three American soldiers dead. Korea continued to refuse to negotiate with the United States until 1882. Initial contact The expedition consisted of about 650 men, over 500 sailors and 100 Marines, as well as five warships:The number of ships is confirmed by Lee (1984), p. 264. , , , , and . Embarked aboard Colorado was Rear Admiral John Rodgers, and Frederick F. Low, the United States Ambassador to China.Lee (1984), loc. cit.Colorado . Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships The Korean forces, known as \\"Tiger Hunters\\", were led by General Eo Jae-yeon (Hangul; Ïñ¥Ïû¨Ïó∞ Hanja; È≠öÂú®Ê∑µ). The Americans safely made contact with the Korean inhabitants, described as \\"people wearing white clothes\\". When they inquired about the General Sherman incident, the Koreans were initially reluctant to discuss the topic, ostensibly to avoid having to pay any recompense. The Americans consequently let the Koreans know that their fleet would be exploring the area, and that they meant no harm. This gesture was misinterpreted; Korean policy at the time prohibited foreign ships from sailing on the Han River, as it led directly to the capital city of Hanyang, modern-day Seoul. On June 1, the Korean fortress fired at the U.S. fleet as they sailed up the Ganghwa Straits, which leads to the river. The U.S. forces were not badly damaged due to \\"the bad gunnery of the [K]oreans, whose fire, although very hot for the fifteen minutes in which they maintained it, was ill-directed, and consequently without effect.\\"\\"Report of Rear Admiral John Rodgers\\". In Reports of the Secretary of the Navy and of the Postmaster General. Washington: Government Printing Office. 1871. p. 277.

Battle of Ganghwa American servicemen after capturing Fort D≈èkjin (Fort Monocacy) on June 10 by Felice Beato. On June 10, the Americans attacked the lightly defended Choji Garrison on Ganghwa, along the Salee River. The Koreans were armed with severely outdated weapons, such as matchlock muskets but with cannons. After they were quickly overrun, the Americans moved onto their next objective, the Deokjin Garrison. The poorly armed Korean forces were kept from effective range by American 12-pound howitzers. The American troops continued on towards the next objective, Deokjin Fort, which they found abandoned. The sailors and Marines quickly dismantled this fortress and continued to Gwangseong Garrison, a citadel. By this time, Korean forces had regrouped there. Along the way, some Korean units tried to flank the U.S. forces, but were beaten off again due to the strategic placement of artillery on two hills. Artillery fire from ground forces and Monocacy offshore pounded the citadel in preparation for an assault by U.S. forces. A force of 546 sailors and 105 Marines grouped on the hills west of the fortress (infantry troops were on the hill directly west of the fortress, while artillery troops on another hill both shelled the fortress and also covered the Americans' flanks and rear) keeping cover and returning fire. Once the bombardment stopped, the Americans charged the citadel, led by Lieutenant Hugh McKee. The slow reload time of the Korean matchlocks aided the Americans, who were armed with superior Remington rolling block carbines, in making it over the walls; the Koreans even ended up throwing rocks at the attackers. McKee was the first to make it into the citadel, and was fatally wounded by a shot to the groin. After him came Commander Winfield Scott Schley, who shot the Korean soldier who had killed McKee.Lexington Morning Herald November 28, 1897 The flag of the Korean commander, General Eo Jae-y≈èn, called the \\"Sujagi\\" by Koreans, was captured by Corporal Charles Brown of Colorados guard and Private Hugh Purvis of Alaskas guard.Report of Captain McLane Tilton to the Secretary of the Navy, Korea, June 16, 1871 General Eo was killed by Private James Dougherty.Report of Commander L.A.

In fact, these events led the regent Daewon-gun to strengthen his policy of isolation and issue a national proclamation against appeasing foreigners.Nahm (1986), p. 149-150; Lee (1984), p. 266. However, there were no further attacks on foreign ships. In 1876, Korea established a trade treaty with Japan after Japanese ships approached Ganghwa Island and threatened to fire on Seoul. Treaties with European countries and the U.S. soon followed. Nine sailors (Chief Quartermaster Grace, Quartermasters Troy, Franklin and Rogers, Boatswain's Mate McKenzie, Ordinary Seaman Andrews, Carpenter Hayden, and Landsmen Lukes and Merton) and six Marines (Corporal Brown and Privates Coleman, Dougherty, McNamara, Owens, and Purvis) were awarded the Medal of Honor, the first for actions in a foreign conflict.

It is a National Historic Landmark. Ellen Glasgow spent many summers at her family's Louisa County, Virginia estate, the historic Jerdone Castle plantation, which her father bought in 1879, and would later use that setting in her writings. Her paternal great-grandfather, Arthur Glasgow, had emigrated with his brothers in 1776 from Scotland to the then- large and frontier Augusta County, Virginia. Her father, Francis Thomas Glasgow, was raised in what had become Rockbridge County, Virginia, graduated from Washington College (now Washington and Lee University) in 1847, and would eventually manage the Tredegar Iron Works. Those had been bought in 1848 by Glasgow's maternal uncle, Joseph Reid Anderson, who had graduated fourth in his class of 49 from West Point in 1836 and would introduce the labor of skilled and enslaved Africans at the ironworks to accompany skilled white workers. Anderson was a major business and political figure in Richmond, who supported the Confederate States of America, joined the Army of Northern Virginia, and attained the rank of general. However, because the Tredegar Ironworks produced munitions crucial to the Confederate cause, General Robert E. Lee asked General Anderson to return and manage the ironworks rather than lead armies in the field. Her mother was Anne Jane Gholson (1831-1893), born to William Yates Gholson and Martha Anne Jane Taylor at Needham plantation in Cumberland County, Virginia. Her grandparents were Congressman Thomas Gholson, Jr. and Anne Yates, who descended from Rev. William Yates, the College of William & Mary's fifth president (1761‚Äì1764). Gholson was descended from William Randolph, a prominent colonist and land owner in the Commonwealth of Virginia. He and his wife, Mary Isham, were sometimes referred to as the \\"Adam and Eve\\" of Virginia. Career Portrait of Ellen Glasgow During more than four decades of literary work, Glasgow published 20 novels, a collection of poems, a book of short stories, and a book of literary criticism. Her first novel, The Descendant (1897) was written in secret and published anonymously when she was 24 years old. She destroyed part of the manuscript after her mother died in 1893. Publication was further delayed because her brother-in- law and intellectual mentor, George McCormack, died the following year. Thus Glasgow completed her novel in 1895.Publishers' Online, May 17, 2009 It features an emancipated heroine who seeks passion rather than marriage. Although it was published anonymously, her authorship became well known the following year, when her second novel, Phases of an Inferior Planet (1898), announced on its title page, \\"by Ellen Glasgow, author of The Descendant.\\" By the time The Descendant was in print, Glasgow had finished Phases of an Inferior Planet.Glasgow 129 The novel portrays the demise of a marriage and focuses on \\"the spirituality of female friendship.\\"Matthews 33, 36 Critics found the story to be \\"sodden with hopelessness all the way though,\\"Scura 21 but \\"excellently told.\\"Scura 31 Glasgow stated that her third novel, The Voice of People (1900) was an objective view of the poor-white farmer in politics.Glasgow 181 The hero is a young Southerner who, having a genius for politics, rises above the masses and falls in love with a higher class girl. Her next novel, The Battle-Ground (1902), sold over 21,000 copies in the first two weeks after publication.Goodman 89 It depicts the South before and during the Civil War and was hailed as \\"the first and best realistic treatment of the war from the southern point of view.\\"Raper 150 The Deliverance (1904) Much of her work was influenced by the romantic interests and human relationships that Glasgow developed throughout her life. The Deliverance (1904) and her previous novel, The Battle-Ground, were written during her affair with Gerald B. They \\"are the only early books in which Glasgow's heroine and hero are united\\" by the novels' ends.Wagner 31 The Deliverance, published in 1904, was the first Glasgow book to garner popular success.Auchinloss 13 The novel portrays a romance built on the dramatic relationship between the hero and the heroine due to traditional class constraints. The hero is an aristocrat turned into a common laborer after the events of the Civil War, and the heroine lacks the aristocratic lineage but obtains aristocratic qualities such as education and refinement.Godbold 64 The genuine affection and reconciliation of the romance of the two were attempts by Glasgow to prove that ‚Äútraditional class consciousness should be inconsequential to love affairs.‚Äù The Deliverance criticizes the institution of marriage because Glasgow herself faced social barriers that prevented her from marrying at that time. The Deliverance is notable for offering ‚Äúa naturalistic treatment of class conflicts‚Äù that emerge after Reconstruction, providing realistic views of social changes in Southern literature. Glasgow's next four novels were written in what she considered her \\"earlier manner\\" Raper 237 and received mixed reviews. The Wheel of Life (1906) sold moderately well based on the success of The Descendant. Despite its commercial success, however, reviewers found the book disappointing.Raper 227 Set in New York (the only novel not set in Virginia), the story tells of domestic unhappiness and tangled love affairs.Scura 102 It was unfavorably compared to Edith Wharton's House of Mirth, which was published that same year. Most critics recommended that Glasgow \\"stick to the South.\\"Raper 228 Glasgow regarded the novel as a failure.Wagner 37 The Ancient Law (1908) portrayed white factory workers in the Virginia textile industry,Raper 231 and analyzes the rise of industrial capitalism and its corresponding social ills.Goodman 107 Critics considered the book overly melodramatic.Scura 129, Wagner 36 With The Romance of a Plain Man (1909) and The Miller of Old Church (1911) Glasgow began concentrating on gender traditions; she contrasted the conventions of the Southern woman with the feminist viewpoint,Wagner 38 a direction which she continued in Virginia (1913). As the United States women's suffrage movement was developing in the early 1900s, Glasgow marched in the English suffrage parades in the spring of 1909. Later she spoke at the first suffrage meeting in Virginia and was an early member of the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia.Glasgow 185-6 Glasgow felt that the movement came \\"at the wrong moment\\" for her, and her participation and interest waned.Glasgow 186 Glasgow did not at first make women's roles her major theme, and she was slow to place heroines rather than heroes at the centers of her stories.Pannill 686 Some called her Virginia (1913; about a southern lady whose husband abandons her when he achieves success), Life and Gabriella (1916; about a woman abandoned by a weak-willed husband, but who becomes a self-sufficient, single mother who remarries well), and Barren Ground (1925); discussed below, her \\"women's trilogy.\\" Her later works have heroines who display many of the attributes of women involved in the political movement. Ellen Glasgow. Glasgow published two more novels, The Builders (1919) and One Man in His Time (1922), as well as a set of short stories (The Shadowy Third and Other Stories (1923)), before producing her novel of greatest personal importance, Barren Ground (1925). Written in response to the waning romantic relationship with Henry W. Anderson, Barren Ground is a story that chronicles the life events of the main heroine.Auchinloss 7 Due to a troubled childhood, the heroine looks for her escape in the form of companionship with the opposite sex. She meets a male companion and gets engaged, only for the companion to leave to New York and desert her. In the end, the heroine concludes that physical relationships with the opposite sex are meaningless and devotes herself to running her farm. Though she triumphs over the man that abandoned her, that victory is as bare and empty as the barren ground in the description of the introduction.Godbold 143 Glasgow wrote Barren Ground in retrospect to her own life, and the heroine's life mirrors hers almost exactly. Glasgow reverses the traditional seduction plot by producing a heroine completely freed from the southern patriarchal influence and pits women against their own biological natures. Though she created an unnatural and melodramatic story that did not sell well with the public, it was hailed as a literary accomplishment by critics of the time. The imagery, descriptive power, and length of the book conveys the ‚Äúunconquerable vastness‚Äù of the world. What endures in the novel is not the ideals of a cynical woman, but rather the landscape that is farmed by generations of humans who spend their brief time on earth on the land.Godbold 145 Glasgow portrays the insignificance of human relationships and romance by contrasting it directly to the vastness of nature itself. By writing Barren Ground, a \\"tragedy,\\" she believed that she freed herself for her comedies of manners The Romantic Comedians (1926), They Stooped to Folly (1929), and The Sheltered Life (1932). These late works are considered the most artful criticism of romantic illusion in her career.Pannill In 1923 a reviewer in Time characterized Glasgow: > She is of the South; but she is not by any manner of means provincial. She > was educated, being a delicate child, at home and at private schools. Yet > she is by no means a woman secluded from life. She has wide contacts and > interests. . . . Here is a really important figure in the history of > American letters; for she has preserved for us the quality and the beauty of > her real South.TIME, 26 Nov 1923 Artistic recognition of her work may have climaxed in 1931 when Glasgow presided over the Southern Writers Conference at the University of Virginia.Inge bio Glasgow produced two more \\"novels of character\\",Wagner 119 The Sheltered Life (1932) and Vein of Iron (1935), in which she continued to explore female independence. The latter and Barren Ground of the previous decade remain in print. In 1941 Glasgow published In This Our Life, the first of her writings to take a bold and progressive attitude towards black people.Godbold 250 Glasgow incorporated African Americans into the story as main characters of the narrative, and these characters become a theme within the novel itself. By portraying the blatant injustices that black people face in society, Glasgow provides a sense of realism in race relations that she had never done before. Due to the ambiguity of the ending, the novel received a mixed and confused response from the public.Godbold 279 There is also a distinct discontinuity between critics of the time and the reading public, as the critics, notably her friends, hailed the novel as a \\"masterpiece,‚Äù and the novel won the Pulitzer Prize for the Novel in 1942.Godbold 286 The novel was quickly bought by Warner Brothers and adapted as a movie by the same name, directed by John Huston and released in 1942. Her autobiography, The Woman Within, published in 1954, years after her death, details her progression as an author and the influences essential for her becoming an acclaimed Southern woman writer. Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings was gathering information for her commissioned biography of Ellen Glasgow prior to her death. Death and legacy Glasgow died in her sleep at home on November 21, 1945,Inge 884 and is buried in Hollywood Cemetery, Richmond, Virginia. The Albert and Shirley Small Special Collections Library at the University of Virginia maintains Glasgow's papers. Copies of Glasgow's correspondence may be found in the Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings papers at the George A. Smathers Libraries Special Collections at the University of Florida. The Library of Virginia honored Glasgow in 2000 as she became a member of the inaugural class of Virginia Women in History. By basing her novels on her own life, Glasgow accurately portrayed the changing nature of Southern society. She was the founder of the realism movement in Southern literature that was previously made up by writers such as William Faulkner, who considered Reconstruction as \\"the greatest humiliation in Southern history.\\"Holman 19 =Personal life and relationships= Glasgow had several love interests during her life. In The Woman Within (1954), an autobiography written for posthumous publication, Glasgow tells of a long, secret affair with a married man she had met in New York City in 1900, whom she called Gerald B.Glasgow, 156 Ellen believed that he was the \\"one great love of her life,\\" noting one particular visit with him in Switzerland: > A summer morning in the Alps. We were walking together over an emerald path. > I remember the moss, the ferny greenness. I remember the Alpine blue of the > sky. I remember, on my lips, the flushed air tasting like honey. The way was > through a thick wood, in a park, and the path wound on and upward, higher > and higher. We walked slowly, scarcely breathing in the brilliant light. On > and upward, higher, and still higher. Then, suddenly, the trees parted, the > woods thinned and disappeared. Earth and sky met and mingled. We stood, hand > in hand, alone in the solitude, alone with the radiant whiteness of the > Jungfrau. From the mountain we turned our eyes to each other. We were > silent, because it seemed to us that all had been said. But the thought > flashed through my mind, and was gone, ‚ÄúNever in all my life can I be > happier than I am, now, here at this moment!‚ÄùGlasgow 164 Since Gerald B.'s wife would not agree to a divorce, Ellen was unable to marry. In the end, nothing occurred but the short-lived meetings in New York and Switzerland; Glasgow wrote in her autobiography that Gerald B. died in 1905.Godbold 62 Ellen also maintained a close lifelong friendship with James Branch Cabell, another notable Richmond writer. She was engaged twice but did not marry. In 1916, Glasgow met Henry W. Anderson, a prominent attorney and Republican Party leader, who collaborated with Glasgow and provided copies of his speeches for her novel The Builders.John T. Kneebone et al., eds., Dictionary of Virginia Biography (Richmond: The Library of Virginia, 1998- ), 1:136-137. He eventually became her fiance in 1917. However, the engagement occurred during the First World War, and Anderson, placed in charge of the Red Cross Commission in order to keep Romania on the side of the Allies, left for the country. There he met Queen Marie of Romania, and Anderson became infatuated with her. These developments, paired with a lack of communication between the two, strained the relationship between Glasgow and Anderson, and the marriage fell through.Godbold 120 Based on her experiences, Glasgow felt her best work was done when love was over.Glasgow, 243-244 By the end of her life, Glasgow lived with her secretary, Anne V. Bennett, 10 years her junior, at her home at 1 West Main Street in Richmond.1940 U.S. Federal census for Richmond City.

Biography Born in Sonora, California, Prestia started playing electric guitar as an adolescent. When he auditioned for Emilio Castillo's band, Tower of Power, Castillo persuaded him to switch to electric bass. Prestia worked with the band for the next three decades, before he became seriously ill in 2001. His fans and friends created a foundation in order to help pay the artist's medical costs. On December 5, 2014, Prestia underwent successful liver transplant surgery. Rocco is survived by two children, Julian Francis Rocco Prestia (30) and Alicia-Lyn JoAnn Prestia (27). Technique and influences Prestia was a master of fingerstyle funk, a technique in which he lightly muted the strings with his left hand to get a percussive sound, with the pitch remaining clear and accurate. That characteristic sound, in combination with a highly rhythmic approach to bass lines, makes Prestia's sound unmistakable. Along with James Jamerson, Stanley Clarke, Anthony Jackson and Alphonso Johnson, Prestia belonged to a generation of musicians that fostered a revolution on the electric bass‚Äîinspiring the innovative work of Jaco Pastorius in the mid-1970s. Prestia's influential style can be heard on classic Tower of Power tracks such as the 1973 hit \\"What is Hip\\". Prestia cited James Jamerson and the different musicians who worked for James Brown (particularly Bootsy Collins) as his main influences. Equipment Prestia's primary instruments were his Fender Precision basses (a purple transparent American Deluxe and a natural ash-bodied short-lived signature model with a reverse split pickup and a 2-band EQ). He later maintained an association with the Conklin company that provided him a custom built four-string instrument, one of the few in the company's catalog. In January 2013, ESP Guitars announced that Prestia had joined their roster of endorsed artists. The company made reference to the introduction of their LTD RB series on May 22, 2014.

The Finnish version was originally published in 1952, with an English edition being published in Great Britain in 1953. Plot The narrator is Jean Ange, alias John Angelos, born in Avignon. Prior to the events of the novel, he had been a friend of Sultan Murad II and then also of his son, Mehmed II; but once Mehmed had begun his march to Constantinople, Ange fled there. The novel begins as Jean Ange meets Anna Notaras in Constantinople and they fall instantly in love. At first Ange is unaware of her identity, but later he realises she is the daughter of megas doux Lucas Notaras. Ange is committed to fight to the death on the side of the Christians against the Islamic Ottoman forces. Nevertheless, his prior relationship with Mehmed earns him constant distrust from both Latin and Greek Christians. Eventually Jean Ange is revealed as a rightful heir of Byzantine emperors, although he has no interest in power. Constantinople ultimately falls under Mehmed's attack, Anna dies while in the disguise of a soldier, and Jean is tortured to death by Mehmed. Research and writing The novel, written in a diary format, was inspired by a real diary by Niccol√≤ Barbaro describing the 1453 siege of Constantinople. The character of Angelos especially had his basis on a marginal note in red ink mentioning a Greek traitor for the Turks by the name of Angelo Zacaria. Scholar Panu Rajala visited Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana, which held both a copy and the original, and read from the checkout list that Mika Waltari was the fourth one to be allowed to examine the book, in 7 November 1952.

It is located on the eastern shore of the Owen Sound Bay, an inlet (sound) on the south shore of Georgian Bay on Lake Huron. Owen Sound Bay is a broad valley that cuts through the Niagara Escarpment. The valley preceded the last great Ice Age, but was broadened by the action of the glacial ice, then by the erosive forces of the Sydenham and Pottowatomi Rivers. During his preliminary survey of Lake Huron in 1815, Captain William Fitzwilliam Owen named it \\"Owen's Sound\\" for his brother, Admiral Sir Edward William Campbell Rich Owen. Located approximately 9 kilometres northeast of the city of Owen Sound in the municipality of Meaford, Leith was established in the mid 1800s on the Telfer Creek where it empties into the Sound. John Telfer, who was appointed the Crown Land Agent for this area in 1840, bought and moved to Leith in 1846 when the settling of Leith began. Leith was twice more sold, from Telfer to James Wilson of Galt in 1854, and from Wilson to Adam Ainslie in 1857. Leith is flanked by the larger Hibou Conservation Area to the west, and by the smaller Ainslie Wood Conservation area to the northeast [Grey- Sauble Conservation Authority]. Hibou boasts two natural sandy beaches, and 2.5 kilometres of nature trails across from the water. There are also many trails from the road to the water's edge, all in close proximity to Leith. A plan to incorporate Leith was created in the 19th century but was never executed. Today Leith is a quiet hamlet with many year-round residents and some summer cottagers. Leith residents enjoy easy access to the waters of Georgian Bay. When the wind blows from the northeast, the sound of the waves crashing along the shoreline is audible throughout the hamlet. At one time a pier capable of serving sailing ships and schooners existed on the northeast side of the mouth of Telfer Creek. \\"Ainslie Wharf\\" was Adam Ainslie's grand enterprise to make Leith a major Great Lakes port. Built in 1861 of cribbed stone and oak posts, the dock was further extended in 1870 to accommodate bigger ships. Grain and cattle, hogs and sheep, cords of maple beech and elm were shipped from this magnificent dock. However, exposure to the open Georgian Bay to the north-northeast eventually caused the destruction of the pier. November storms, winter ice and two ship disasters at the dock weakened it, eventually making it a dangerous structure which the townsfolk tore down after Ainslie's death. All that remains in the water are a collection of old wooden pilings, serving principally as perches for waterfowl and an obstacle to pleasure boaters. A superior harbour in the city of Owen Sound at the end of the inlet, eventually led to the demise of Leith as a commercial port. There is a small public gravel beach in Leith and public access to small craft boating from Telfer Creek. The mouth of Telfer Creek is now protected habitat for large schools of baby trout. Leith is renowned for the beauty of its landscape, both at the water's edge, and in the surrounding countryside. The old Leith Church is the site of the grave of Tom Thomson, a noted Canadian landscape painter who died in mysterious circumstances at Canoe Lake in Algonquin Park in 1917. Thomson was a friend of the Group of Seven, famous landscape painters many of whose works are on permanent display at the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. He grew up in Leith. Leith was also the favourite summer place for artist Carl Ahrens, [1862-1936], one of Canada's foremost landscape painters, whose works can still be viewed at the National Art Gallery in Ottawa, and other galleries throughout Canada and Britain. In the late 1850s and early 1860s there was a grist mill and a flour mill, an oatmeal mill at Keefer's Creek, a tannery, 3 stores, a distillery, a dock and several store houses, a church and cemetery, several frame houses, a hotel and stables, a tavern, both picnic and cricket grounds, as well as boot and shoe maker, blacksmith, 4 carpenters and shingle makers, a teacher and a postmaster. Mail began to arrive in Leith in 1853, and was delivered from Sydenham (Owen Sound) post office by steam boat bi-weekly to Ainslie Wharf. By 2004 only one of the stores remained and the post office had closed. Until 2013 the Bays River Restaurant operated in the building which was once the golf course club house and dance hall. On a clear day the view from the restaurant across the mouth of the Owen Sound inlet is spectacular. The scenic Bayshore Road cuts through the hamlet of Leith and continues along the shoreline for many miles, serving various small laneways for cottagers and shoreline residences. Leith is well known for sport fishing. In 1921 sea lamprey or Lamprey Eel (Petromyzon marinus) invaded the Great Lakes through the Welland Canal, though, significantly reducing the numbers of lake trout and whitefish. While the lake trout have largely vanished from Lake Huron, rainbow trout and salmon still exist in the lake. Since 1988 a species native to Asia, zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha), have invaded the Great Lakes and the Owen Sound area has not been spared. Swimmers at Leith have received cuts to their bare feet from the very sharp shells of these little molluscs.In the 1990s the Great Lakes were again invaded by the round goby, a small bottom-dwelling fish, which feasts on zebra mussels along with fish eggs and native baby trout. Round gobys can often be observed feeding in the shallow waters at the bridge over Telfer Creek in Leith. The zebra mussel population has been kept at bay. An area on the Georgian Bay water between Owen Sound and Leith, simply marked with a green buoy, is known by local salmon and trout anglers as \\"Thomson's Hole\\". The fishing hole has garnered some of the area's best fishing and is a popular fishing stop during the Owen Sound Salmon Spectacular Derby. The fishing hole is known for its extreme depth and its plentiful fishing but is also a popular sailing area. In 1997, a stained glass window designed by Ellen Simon entitled \\"Nativity Scene\\" circa 1954 in the United Church in Leith, Ontario was illustrated on the U.S.-rate Canada Postage stamp in the Christmas series.Canada Post The window remains in the Leith Church today and is viewable when the church is open. The old Leith Church closed in 1969, as did the old Leith Golf Course in the 1970s. The Leith congregation now worships at the United Church just up the hill in Annan. The Leith church building fell into disrepair for a number of years. However, since 1992 the church and nearby cemetery have been declared a designated heritage site under the Ontario Heritage Act. The church has been refurbished and is now maintained by a vigorous, energetic and strong community of volunteers known as the \\"Friends of Leith Church\\" [FOLC]. The church is occasionally opened for special events and regular fundraising continues to maintain the building. Due to the excellent acoustics, the church building is regularly used for musical concerts during the spring, summer and fall period [Leith Summer Festival]. It has a seating capacity of 180 and is particularly renowned for chamber music ensembles.

Uru-ka-gina, Uru-inim-gina, or Iri- ka-gina ( ; 24th century BC, short chronology) was King of the city-states of Lagash and Girsu in Mesopotamia, and the last ruler of the 1st Dynasty of Lagash. He assumed the title of king, claiming to have been divinely appointed, upon the downfall of his corrupt predecessor, Lugalanda. He is best known for his reforms to combat corruption, which are sometimes cited as the first example of a legal code in recorded history. Although the actual text has not been discovered, much of its content may be surmised from other references to it that have been found. In it, he exempted widows and orphans from taxes; compelled the city to pay funeral expenses (including the ritual food and drink libations for the journey of the dead into the lower world); and decreed that the rich must use silver when purchasing from the poor, and if the poor does not wish to sell, the powerful man (the rich man or the priest) cannot force him to do so. He also participated in several conflicts, notably a losing border conflict with Uruk. In the seventh year of his reign, Uruk fell under the leadership of Lugal-Zage-Si, √©nsi of Umma, who ultimately annexed most of the territory of Lagash and established the first reliably documented kingdom to encompass all of Sumer. The destruction of Lagash was described in a lament (possibly the earliest recorded example of what would become a prolific Sumerian literary genre), which stressed that \\"the men of Umma ... committed a sin against Ningirsu. ... Offence there was none in Urukagina, king of Girsu, but as for Lugal-Zage-Si, governor of Umma, may his goddess Nisaba make him carry his sin upon his neck\\" (alternatively ‚Äì \\"may she carry his sin upon her neck\\"). Lugal-Zage-Si himself was soon defeated and his kingdom was annexed by Sargon of Akkad. Reforms Urukagina's code has been widely hailed as the first recorded example of government reform, seeking to achieve a higher level of freedom and equality.\\"Social Reform in Mesopotamia\\", Benjamin R. Foster, in Social Justice in the Ancient World, K. Irani and M. Silver eds., 1995, p. 169. It limited the power of the priesthood and large property owners, and took measures against usury, burdensome controls, hunger, theft, murder, and seizure (of people's property and persons); as he states, \\"The widow and the orphan were no longer at the mercy of the powerful man\\". Here, the word \\"freedom\\" (\\"ama-gi\\"), appears for the first time in recorded history. Despite these apparent attempts to curb the excesses of the elite class, it seems elite or royal women enjoyed even greater influence and prestige in his reign than previously. Urukagina greatly expanded the royal \\"Household of Women\\" from about 50 persons to about 1500 persons, renamed it the \\"Household of goddess Bau\\", gave it ownership of vast amounts of land confiscated from the former priesthood, and placed it under the supervision of his wife, Shasha (or Shagshag).Katherine I. Wright, Archaeology and Women, 2007, p. 206. In his second year of reign, Shasha presided over the lavish funeral of his predecessor's queen, Baranamtarra, who had been an important personage in her own right. In addition to such changes, two of his other surviving decrees, first published and translated by Samuel Kramer in 1964, have attracted controversy in recent decades. First, he seems to have abolished the former custom of polyandry in his country, on pain of the woman taking multiple husbands being stoned with rocks upon which her crime is written.The Powers p. 40 by Walter Wink, 1992 Second is a statute stating that \\"if a woman says [text illegible...] to a man, her mouth is crushed with burnt bricks.\\" No comparable laws from Urukagina addressing penalties for adultery by men have survived. The discovery of these fragments has led some modern critics to assert that they provide \\"the first written evidence of the degradation of women\\".Marilyn French, From Eve to Dawn: A History of Women, 2008, p. 100. =Excerpt of some regulations from the Reform document= * From the border territory of Ningirsu to the sea, no person shall serve as officers. * For a corpse being brought to the grave, his beer shall be 3 jugs and his bread 80 loaves.

While the kings may not always live up to this praise they show the type of achievements that they wished to be remembered by. Extracts below praise Urukagina who appears as a social reformer, getting rid of gross abuses of power that had taken hold in Lagash. # Since time immemorial, since life began, in those days, the head boatman appropriated boats, the livestock official appropriated asses, the livestock official appropriated sheep, and the fisheries inspector appropriated.... The shepherds of wool sheep paid a duty in silver on account of white sheep, and the surveyor, chief lamentation-singer, supervisor, brewer and foremen paid a duty in silver on account of young lambs. . . These were the conventions of former times! # When Ningirsu, warrior of Enlil, granted the kingship of Lagash to Urukagina, selecting him from among the myriad people, he replaced the customs of former times, carrying out the command that Ningirsu, his master, had given him. # He removed the head boatman from control over the boats, he removed the livestock official from control over asses and sheep, he removed the fisheries inspector from control.... # He removed the silo supervisor from control over the grain taxes of the guda-priests, he removed the bureaucrat responsible for the paying of duties in silver on account of white sheep and young lambs, and he removed the bureaucrat responsible for the delivery of duties by the temple administrators to the palace. # The... administrators no longer plunder the orchards of the poor. When a high quality ass is born to a shublugal, and his foreman says to him, \\"I want to buy it from you\\"; whether he lets him buy it from him and says to him \\"Pay me the price I want!,\\" or whether he does not let him buy it from him, the foreman must not strike at him in anger. # When the house of an aristocrat adjoins the house of a shublugal, and the aristocrat says to him, \\"I want to buy it from you\\"; whether he lets him buy it from him, having said to him, \\"Pay me the price I want! My house is a large container‚Äîfill it with barley for me!,\\" or whether he does not let him buy it from him, that aristocrat must not strike at him in anger. # He cleared and cancelled obligations for those indentured families, citizens of Lagash living as debtors because of grain taxes, barley payments, theft or murder. # Urukagina solemnly promised Ningirsu that he would never subjugate the waif and the widow to the powerful.Praise of Urukagina Lament about the fall of Lagash to Umma Urukagina participated in several conflicts, notably a losing border conflict with Uruk.

He joined several journeys of the Westward Expansion to paint the scenes. He was not the first artist to record the sites, but he was the foremost painter of them for the remainder of the 19th century. Bierstadt was born in Prussia, but his family moved to the United States when he was one year old. He returned to study painting for several years in D√ºsseldorf. He became part of the second generation of the Hudson River School in New York, an informal group of like-minded painters who started painting along the Hudson River. Their style was based on carefully detailed paintings with romantic, almost glowing lighting, sometimes called luminism. Bierstadt was an important interpreter of the western landscape, and he is also grouped with the Rocky Mountain School. Early life and education Bierstadt was born in Solingen, Germany, the son of Christina M. (Tillmans) and Henry Bierstadt, a cooper. His brother was prominent photographer Edward Bierstadt. Albert was just a year old when his family immigrated to New Bedford, Massachusetts in 1831. He made clever crayon sketches in his youth and developed a taste for art. In 1851, Bierstadt began to paint in oils. He returned to Germany in 1853 and studied painting for several years in D√ºsseldorf with members of its informal school of painting. After returning to New Bedford in 1857, he taught drawing and painting briefly before devoting himself full-time to painting. Career Rocky Mountain Landscape, in the White House Among the Sierra Nevada, California (1868), Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC In 1858, Bierstadt exhibited a large painting of a Swiss landscape at the National Academy of Design, which gained him positive critical reception and honorary membership in the Academy. Bierstadt began painting scenes in New England and upstate New York, including in the Hudson River valley. He was part of a group of artists known as the Hudson River School. In 1859, Bierstadt traveled westward in the company of Frederick W. Lander, a land surveyor for the U.S. government, to see those western American landscapes for his work.Mount Corcoran National Gallery of Art, retrieved September 14, 2018 He returned to a studio he had taken at the Tenth Street Studio Building in New York with sketches for numerous paintings he then finished. In 1860, he was elected a member of the National Academy of Design; he received medals in Austria, Bavaria, Belgium, and Germany. In 1863, Bierstadt traveled West again, this time in the company of the author Fitz Hugh Ludlow, whose wife he later married. The pair spent seven weeks in the Yosemite Valley. Throughout the 1860s, Bierstadt used studies from this trip as the source for large-scale paintings for exhibition and he continued to visit the American West throughout his career. The immense canvases he produced after his trips with Lander and Ludlow established him as the preeminent painter of the western American landscape. Bierstadt's technical proficiency, earned through his study of European landscape, was crucial to his success as a painter of the American West and accounted for his popularity in disseminating views of the Rocky Mountains to those who had not seen them. During the American Civil War (1861 to 1865), Bierstadt was drafted in 1863 and paid for a substitute to serve in his place. By 1862, he had completed one Civil War painting Guerrilla Warfare, Civil War based on his brief experiences with soldiers stationed at Camp Cameron in 1861. That painting was based on a stereoscopic photograph taken by his brother Edward Bierstadt, who operated a photography studio at Langley's Tavern in Virginia. The painting received a positive review when it was exhibited at the Brooklyn Art Association at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in December 1861. Curator Eleanor Jones Harvey observed that the painting, created from photographs, \\"is quintessentially that of a voyeur, privy to the stories and unblemished by the violence and brutality of first-hand combat experience.\\" The Last of the Buffalo (1888), National Gallery of Art. Financial recognition confirmed his status: The Rocky Mountains, Lander's Peak, completed in 1863, was purchased for $25,000 in 1865, the equivalent of almost $400,000 in 2020. In 1867, Bierstadt traveled to London, where he exhibited two landscape paintings in a private reception with Queen Victoria.\\"Bierstadt, Albert\\", National Gallery of Art. Retrieved February 2, 2018. He traveled through Europe for two years, cultivating social and business contacts to sustain the market for his work overseas. His exhibition pieces were brilliant images, which glorified the American West as a land of promise and \\"fueled European emigration\\". He painted Among the Sierra Nevada, California in his Rome studio for example, showed it in Berlin and London before shipping it to the U.S. As a result of the publicity generated by his Yosemite Valley paintings in 1868, Bierstadt's presence was requested by every explorer considering a westward expedition, and he was commissioned by the Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad to visit the Grand Canyon for further subject matter.Barringer and Wilton, 250 Bierstadt's choice of grandiose subjects was matched by his entrepreneurial flair. His exhibitions of individual works were accompanied by promotion, ticket sales, and, in the words of one critic, a \\"vast machinery of advertisement and puffery.\\" Rosalie Bierstadt, unknown date Despite his popular success, Bierstadt was criticized by some contemporaries for the romanticism evident in his choices of subject and his use of light was felt to be excessive. Some critics objected to Bierstadt's paintings of Native Americans on the grounds that Indians \\"marred\\" the \\"impression of solitary grandeur.\\" In 1876, his wife was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and from then until her death in 1893, Bierstadt spent time with her in the warmer climate of Nassau in the Bahamas. He also continued to travel to the West and Canada. In later life, Bierstadt's work fell increasingly out of critical favor. It was attacked for its theatrical tone. In 1882, a fire destroyed Bierstadt's studio at Irvington, New York, and with it many of his paintings. By the time of his death on February 18, 1902, the taste for epic landscape painting had long since subsided. Bierstadt was then largely forgotten. He was buried at the Rural Cemetery in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Posthumous reception Interest in Bierstadt's work was renewed in the 1960s with the exhibition of his small oil studies. Modern opinions of Bierstadt have been divided. Some critics have regarded his work as gaudy, oversized, extravagant champions of Manifest Destiny. Others have noted that his landscapes helped create support for the conservation movement and the establishment of Yellowstone National Park. Subsequent reassessment of his work has placed it in a favorable context, as stated in 1987: Bierstadt was a prolific artist, having completed over 500 paintings during his lifetime.

Life and career Bouguereau's Gabrielle Cot, a portrait of Cot's daughter Girl with Basket of Oranges and Lemons Cot was born in B√©darieux, H√©rault, and initially studied at l'Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Toulouse before going to Paris. He studied under Leon Cogniet, Alexandre Cabanel and William-Adolphe Bouguereau. In 1863 he made a successful debut at the Salon, and from the 1870s, his popularity grew quickly. Cot enjoyed the patronage of the academic sculptor Francisque Duret, whose daughter he married, and of Bouguereau, with whom he had also worked. Bouguereau painted a portrait of Cot's daughter, Gabrielle. Bouguereau had dined with the Cot family to celebrate Gabrielle's marriage to an architect named Zilin. The artist made a gift of the painting to the wife of Duret, Gabrielle's grandmother.Sotheby's catalogue notes and provenance. The portrait has been known variously as T√™te de jeune fille (\\"Head of a Young Girl\\"), Portrait of Gabrielle Drienza, Portrait de Madame Z, and Head of [Mme] Ailin, Gabrielle Cot. Cot won various prizes and medals, and in 1874 was made Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. He died in Paris at the age of 46. He is buried at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. Works Spring, 1873 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City) He created several works of lasting popularity, including Le Printemps, featuring two young lovers sitting upon a swing, and The Storm. Both these paintings are on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City; The Storm belongs to the museum while Le Printemps is owned privately. Cot also was renowned for his portraits, which made up the majority of his work. The more enduring figurative work, such as The Storm, is comparatively rare. Shortly after his death at the age of forty- six (2 August 1883), a subscription was undertaken for a commemorative monument to the artist, which was erected at B√©darieux in 1892. =Selected works= * Dionysia (1870), Chi-Mei Museum, Taiwan * Ophelia (1870) * The Gypsy or La Boh√©mienne (1871) * Spring or Le Printemps (1873), Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City * The Storm or La Temp√™te (1880), Metropolitan Museum of Art * The Reading Light or La Liseuse (about 1880) * Portrait of Madame Mas (1882) * Mireille (1882), Mus√©e Fabre, Montpellier * Charity for My Sister, Wolverhampton Art Gallery Students *Ellen Day Hale (1855‚Äì1940) *Anna Elizabeth Klumpke (1856‚Äì1942) Notes External links Category:1837 births Category:1883 deaths Category:People from B√©darieux Category:19th- century French painters Category:French male painters Category:Academic art Category:Faculty of the Acad√©mie Julian Category:Chevaliers of the L√©gion d'honneur Category:Burials at P√®re Lachaise Cemetery ","title":"Pierre Auguste Cot"},{"id":"287997","text":"Nadine Blacklock (1953‚Äì1998) was a nature photographer best known for her detailed nature photography of the Lake Superior area.

Key later released versions of Kanon without the erotic content, and the game was ported to the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. The story follows the life of Yuichi Aizawa, a high school student who returns to a city he last visited seven years prior, and he has little recollection of the events from back then. He meets several girls and slowly regains his lost memories. The gameplay in Kanon follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters by the player character. The game once ranked as the second best-selling PC game sold in Japan, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. Kanon has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms. Following the game's release, Kanon made several transitions into other media. Two manga series were serialized in Dengeki Daioh and Dragon Age Pure. Comic anthologies, light novels and art books were also published, as were audio dramas and several music albums. Toei Animation produced a 13-episode anime television series in 2002 and an original video animation (OVA) episode in 2003. Kyoto Animation produced a 24-episode anime series in 2006. The 2006 anime was licensed and dubbed in English by ADV Films in 2008, but the license was given to Funimation after ADV's closure. The 2006 anime plays on the association between Kanon and the musical term canon by using Pachelbel's Kanon D-dur, or Canon in D major, as a background piece at certain instances throughout the series. Gameplay Typical dialogue and narrative in Kanon, depicting the main character Yuichi talking to Ayu. Kanon is a romance visual novel in which the player assumes the role of Yuichi Aizawa. Much of its gameplay is spent on reading the story's narrative and dialogue. Kanon follows a branching plot line with multiple endings, and depending on the decisions that the player makes during the game, the plot will progress in a specific direction. There are five main plot lines that the player will have the chance to experience, one for each of the heroines in the story. Throughout gameplay, the player is given multiple options to choose from, and text progression pauses at these points until a choice is made. To view all plot lines in their entirety, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and choose different choices to further the plot to an alternate direction. After Mai's scenario is completed, a replay of her route will offer an additional choice to play through Sayuri's back-story. Jun Maeda, who worked on the scenario for Kanon, commented in March 2001 that the Japanese public may have fallen under the impression that Key makes soothing games because of Kanon's influence, but Maeda affirmed that there was not one person who worked on Kanon who thought that. In the adult versions of the game, there are scenes with sexual CGs depicting Yuichi and a given heroine having sex. Later, Key released versions of Kanon without the erotic content. The versions that include the adult content have one explicit sex scene in each of the five main story routes, in addition to one fantasy scene. Outside of these, there are two scenes with nudity. Y≈´ichi Suzumoto, a scenario writer who worked on later Key titles, commented that the sex scenes in Kanon are very self-contained, and can be easily removed without altering the story. Maeda remarked that the sex scenes were not written with reproduction in mind. Plot =Setting and themes= There are several important locations featured in the Kanon story, though the location names are seldom mentioned explicitly in Key's works. The events of the story occur during winter, and since it often snows periodically over the course of the entire story, the city is always presented covered in a layer of snow. The shopping district is featured throughout the story when the characters go into town, and especially whenever Ayu appears in the early story. The high school where Yuichi and the other main characters attend, including the school grounds, is shown predominantly in Shiori's and Mai's stories, and is otherwise a general setting where Yuichi interacts with other characters. There are recurring themes that appear throughout the story. A music theme is present, as the episode titles from the 2006‚Äì2007 anime have parts in their titles related to music, such as overture and introit. Miracles play a large part in the story; Kanons plot line and characters are influenced by various instances where miracles occur.Untranslated quote: Ëµ∑„Åç„Å™„ÅÑ„Åã„Çâ„ÄÅÂ•áË∑°„Å£„Å¶Ë®Ä„ÅÜ„Çì„Åß„Åô„Çà Translated quote: \\"It's called a miracle because it doesn't happen.\\" The act of promising and keeping promises is found throughout the story.Untranslated quote: Á¥ÑÊùü„ÄÅ„Å†„Çà Translated quote: \\"It's a promise.\\" Yuichi eventually makes important promises to the five main girls while at the same time fulfilling past promises he had made with four of them when he used to visit the city as a kid. One of the motifs in the story is amnesia, or memory loss; three of the main characters‚ÄîYuichi, Ayu and Makoto‚Äîsuffer from amnesia in varying degrees; this is used as a plot device to advance the story. Another motif deals with the favorite foods of the five main heroines. Newtype USA stated in an article on Kanon that \\"it's when the characters are eating something really tasty that they seem most beautiful and alive\\", despite the somber setting and overall tone of the series. These five foods of choice are: taiyaki (Ayu), strawberries (Nayuki), nikuman (Makoto), ice cream (Shiori), and gyudon (Mai). =Principal characters= The player assumes the role of Yuichi Aizawa, the protagonist of Kanon. He is a cynical 17-year-old high school student, and is known to play jokes on the girls his age he knows and interacts with throughout the story. Despite this, Yuichi is very loyal and will go to great lengths to please others, even at the expense of his own time and money. He generally has a selfless personality and does not ask much from others in return for what he does for them. Ayu Tsukimiya, the main heroine of Kanon, is a short, strange, and mysterious girl immediately recognizable by her winged backpack, red hair band, and tendency to refer to herself with the masculine first-person pronoun . She has a fondness for eating taiyaki, and is notorious for her catchphrase, , which she mutters as an expression of various negative emotions such as frustration, pain, and fear. Yuichi's first cousin Nayuki Minase, another of Kanon's heroines, has been in love with him since childhood, and must learn how to deal with her feelings, especially with the threat that he may fall in love with one of the other girls. Nayuki talks noticeably slower than those around her, and has constant trouble waking up in the morning except on a few occasions when she is up before Yuichi, much to his surprise. Yuichi is accosted a few days after arriving in the city by Kanon's third heroine Makoto Sawatari, a young girl who has lost her memories, but despite this she is sure that she holds a grudge against Yuichi from when he last visited the city. Makoto has a mischievous side and constantly plays pranks on Yuichi. She has an affinity towards the spring and once wished that it would stay spring forever.Untranslated quote: Êò•„Åå„Åç„Å¶ÔΩ•ÔΩ•ÔΩ•„Åö„Å£„Å®Êò•„Å†„Å£„Åü„Çâ„ÅÑ„ÅÑ„ÅÆ„Å´ Translated quote: \\"If only spring would come and stay forever.\\" Yuichi coincidentally runs into Shiori Misaka, another heroine and first-year high school student suffering from an unexplained illness since birth. Her affliction has caused her to become very physically weak, and she is almost always absent from school because of it. She tries to be strong in the face of her condition, and gets along well with others, even though she does not know very many people her age due to her condition. The fifth and final heroine in Kanon is Mai Kawasumi, a third-year student of the same high school that Yuichi attends. She has a cold attitude towards almost everyone, but despite this, she is actually a very kind and caring person; she \\"punishes\\" someone who makes a playful joke about her by giving them a light karate chop to the head. =Story= Kanons story revolves around a group of five girls whose lives are connected to the same boy. Yuichi Aizawa is a second-year high school student who had visited the city where the story takes place seven years prior to Kanon's beginning. The story opens on Wednesday January 6, 1999 when Yuichi arrives in the city and is very detached from it and its inhabitants. Prior to his return, it is decided that he is to stay with his first cousin, Nayuki Minase, and her mother, Akiko. After his long absence, Yuichi has forgotten almost everything except minor details of what happened seven years before and is in need of being reminded of what he left behind. Nayuki initially tries repeatedly to jog his memory, but is unsuccessful. Throughout the story, as he learns about the supernatural undertones of the city, Yuichi is reminded of the events of seven years ago. On the day after Yuichi's return, he is out with Nayuki who is showing him around city. Nayuki remembers that she has to buy things for dinner, but Yuichi is reluctant to go into the store with her. Moments after Nayuki leaves him waiting on the sidewalk, a strange girl named Ayu Tsukimiya collides with him with little warning. Upon recovering, she drags him away to a nearby caf√© and confesses to inadvertently stealing a bag filled with taiyaki after being accidentally scared away by the salesman before she had a chance to pay. They decide to meet up again another day and Ayu scampers off. A few days after he has been in the city, Yuichi is accosted by a girl named Makoto Sawatari who has lost her memories, though still remembers that she has a grudge against him from when he last visited the city. After she collapses in the street, he takes her home and learns about her situation. Akiko gives her permission to live with them for the time being, which is against Yuichi's plan to hand her over to the police. Another girl who is connected to Yuichi's past is Mai Kawasumi who attends his high school as a third-year. She takes it upon herself to fight and defeat demons at night while the school is deserted.Untranslated quote: ÁßÅ„ÅØÈ≠îÁâ©„ÇíË®é„Å§ËÄÖ„Å†„Åã„Çâ Translated quote: \\"I'm a demon hunter.\\" Due to this, she is constantly blamed for accidents because she never denies them, being too sincere to say anything and knowing that no one will believe that there are demons in the school. Yuichi coincidentally meets a fifth girl named Shiori Misaka who he gets to know along with the other four heroines in the story. She has suffered from an unexplained affliction since birth which makes her weak to the point of missing school because of it. Yuichi starts to talk with her more after noticing her in the school courtyard one day. It turns out that Shiori stands outside on the school grounds nearly every day because she wants to meet someone dear to her. Development Most of Kanons development staff originally worked for the visual novel publisher Nexton under the brand Tactics. After the release of the brand's third game One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e, most of Tactics' staff left Nexton to pursue work in another publishing company where they could have the freedom to produce their next game. Itaru Hinoue, who had previously worked at Visual Arts once before, introduced Key's founding members to the president of Visual Arts, Takahiro Baba. Baba gave the developers the freedom they desired, and they officially transferred to Visual Arts where they formed Key on July 21, 1998 and started production on Kanon. The planning for the visual novel was headed by Naoki Hisaya who was also one of two scenario writers with Jun Maeda. Hisaya wrote the scenarios for Ayu, Nayuki and Shiori, while Maeda wrote the routes for Makoto and Mai. Art direction was headed by Key's artist Itaru Hinoue who worked on the character design and computer graphics. Further computer graphics were split between three people‚ÄîDinn, Miracle Mikipon, Shinory‚Äîand background art was provided by Torino. The music in the game was composed by OdiakeS, Shinji Orito and Jun Maeda. Kanon was the first and last visual novel developed by Key that two of the main staff‚ÄîNaoki Hisaya, and OdiakeS‚Äîworked on before pursuing a similar line of work in other visual novel studios. =Release history= Kanon was released as an adult game on June 4, 1999 in limited and regular editions, playable on a Windows PC as a CD-ROM.

The only exception was Yuichi, who was not voiced in either version. However, the PSP release features voice acting for Yuichi, provided by Tomokazu Sugita. Adaptations =Light novels= Five adult light novels written by Mariko Shimizu and published by Paradigm were released in Japan between October 1999 and August 2000. The cover art and internal illustrations were drawn by Itaru Hinoue, the artist who drew the artwork in the visual novel. The basis for each novel was one of each of the five heroines and had titles that were taken from the musical themes pertaining to each character in the original game. The first two released were and in December 1999. The third was released in April 2000 and the fourth novel was titled The Fox and the Grapes (Makoto), released two months later. The final novel titled was released in August 2000. Paradigm re-released the five novels in conjunction with Visual Arts under their VA Bunko imprint, which removed the erotic scenes, starting with Yuki no Sh≈çjo on June 27, 2009, and ending with Hidamari no Machi on December 26, 2009. To make up for the missing erotic content, Shimizu wrote additional content for each volume. A sixth novel titled for the supporting character Sayuri Kurata written by Shimizu and illustrated by Zen was released on March 31, 2011. =Drama CDs and radio shows= A set of five drama CDs were released between September 29, 2000 and April 27, 2001, with each volume focusing on a different heroine. A set of five anthology drama CDs were released between December 22, 2001 and May 25, 2002, with each volume again focusing on a different heroine. A radio show to promote the Dreamcast port of Kanon titled broadcast 13 episodes between October 6 and December 29, 2000. The show, produced by Movic, was hosted by Yukari Tamura and Tomoko Kawakami, the voices Mai Kawasumi and Sayuri Kurata, respectively. A radio drama titled broadcast 53 episodes between October 6, 2001 and October 5, 2002. The show, which was broadcast on TBS Radio and Radio Kansai, was hosted by Y≈´ko Minaguchi, the voice of Akiko Minase, and narrated by Atsushi Kisaichi. The voice actors from Kanon were also featured as guests. Five CD compilation volumes containing all of the show's broadcasts were released between August 30, 2002 and April 26, 2003. =Manga= The first Kanon manga illustrated by Petit Morishima was serialized in MediaWorks' manga magazine Dengeki Daioh between the February 2000 and July 2002 issues. The individual chapters were later collected into two separate tank≈çbon volumes published by MediaWorks under their Dengeki Comics imprint released in September 2000 and on July 27, 2002. There are six chapters in total, three in each volume. Aside from the prologue in volume one and the epilogue in volume two, the other four chapters concern four of the main heroines. From chapters one through four, the main heroines presented are: Shiori Misaka, Makoto Sawatari, Mai Kawasumi and Ayu Tsukimiya. To make up for Nayuki not getting a chapter of her own, the story is altered in that Nayuki is in most of the scenes Yuichi is in. The first manga is different from the visual novel in that Shiori's, Makoto's, and Mai's stories are not told in their entirety. Near the end of each of these girls' stories were originally intended to give the viewer the remaining answers, but the manga version ends these girls' stories prematurely. This was due to the manga putting more focus on Ayu's story. The second manga illustrated by Kinusa Shimotsuki, under the main title with the subtitle each regret of Kanon, was serialized between volumes two and seven of Fujimi Shobo's Dragon Age Pure magazine sold between June 29, 2006 and October 20, 2007, respectively. The first volume was released in Japan on April 1, 2007 and focused on Nayuki's story. The second volume was released on December 8, 2007 and focused on the other four heroines. There are nine chapters in total, five in volume one and four in volume two. There have also been many releases of manga anthologies produced by different companies and drawn by a multitude of different artists. The first volume of the earliest anthology series, released by Ichijinsha under the title Kanon Comic Anthology, was released in November 2000 under their DNA Media Comics label. Volumes for this series continued to be released for another two years, ending in December 2002 with the 14th volume; an additional 15th volume was released later in February 2007. Ichijinsha also released two more volumes of anthology collections of four-panel comic strips titled Kanon 4-koma Kings in April and June 2001. Softgarage released an anthology in a single volume in December 2002 titled Kanon Anthology Comic. In April 2004, Ohzora released an anthology composed of works based on both Kanon and Air titled Haru Urara: Kanon & Air. Between June and August 2004, Ohzora also released five separate volumes of manga based on Kanon drawn by five separate artists. Ohzora later collected some of the previously published manga anthologies into two volumes titled Kanon Anthology Comics Best Selection released in December 2006 and January 2007.

Thirteen episodes were produced and aired in Japan on Fuji TV between January 31 and March 28, 2002. The series also later aired on Kansai TV. Later, a single original video animation (OVA) episode titled \\"Kanon Kazahana\\" was released in March 2003. The anime series and OVA used the songs \\"Florescence\\" and \\"Flower\\" for the opening and ending themes, respectively. While it does not appear as the ending theme in the first 12 episodes or in the OVA, the game's ending theme \\"Where the Wind Reaches\\" is used as the ending theme for the series in episode 13. Additionally, the game's opening theme \\"Last regrets\\" is played near the end of episode 13 during the flashback scene. Starting in 2006, Kyoto Animation, the animators of another Key game- turned-anime, Air, decided to animate a new adaptation of Kanon. This version, directed by Tatsuya Ishihara and written by Fumihiko Shimo, aired between October 5, 2006 and March 15, 2007 on BS-i, containing 24 episodes. The series was later rebroadcast on TBS. ADV Films announced on September 21, 2007 at the Anime Weekend Atlanta anime convention that they have officially licensed the second Kanon anime series. ADV had previously posted a trailer for the series in August 2007, but was soon taken offline once the news had been spread on the Internet. The first English-dubbed episode was made available via streaming online at Anime News Network between December 23 and December 30, 2007. In July 2008, the licensing rights of the second Kanon anime were transferred from ADV to Funimation Entertainment who continued to produce the series in North America. The second TV Kanon animation features updated animation quality, and uses the same voice acting cast as the first anime, with the exception of Yuichi and Kuze. Unlike the first anime, the actual theme songs from the Kanon game are used for the second anime's opening theme, ending theme and soundtrack. There is one song featured as an insert song in episode 16 that did not come from the visual novel titled \\"Last regrets (X'mas floor style)\\" by Eiko Shimamiya from I've Sound's first album Regret. Other songs are used from the arrange albums released over the years, which include Anemoscope, Recollections, Re-feel, and Ma-Na. Music The visual novel has two main theme songs, the opening theme \\"Last regrets\\", and the ending theme , both sung by Ayana. The lyrics for both songs were written by Jun Maeda, and arranged by Kazuya Takase of I've Sound. The five heroines have leitmotifs. Ayu's theme is ; Nayuki's theme is ; Makoto's theme is \\"The Fox and the Grapes\\"; Shiori's theme is ; lastly, Mai's theme is . The first music album released was Anemoscope which came bundled with the original release of Kanon in June 1999. The next release was a single, \\"Last regrets/Place of wind which arrives\\", which contained the opening and ending themes plus arranged versions of three background music tracks and a male vocal version of the opening theme. A compilation album containing tracks from the two albums was released in December 2001 called Recollections. The game's original soundtrack was released in October 2002 containing 22 different tracks along with short versions of the two theme songs. A piano arrange album was released in December 2003 called Re-feel which contained five tracks from Kanon and five from Air. Excluding the first two albums, each of the albums released for the visual novel version were released on Key's record label Key Sounds Label; this is due to the first two albums being released before the label was formed. The first anime's first original soundtrack was released in May 2002, and a second followed in July 2002. The first anime's opening theme is \\"Florescence\\" and the ending theme is \\"Flower\\", both sung by Miho Fujiwara; the maxi single containing the anime's opening and ending themes was released in June 2002. An album containing music box arranged tracks of music from the first anime was released in July 2003 called Orgel de Kiku Sakuhin Sh≈´. The albums released for the first anime were produced by Frontier Works and Movic. A single was released in commemoration for the second anime called \\"Last regrets/Kaze no Tadoritsuku Basho\\" which contained the game's original opening and ending themes in original, short, and remixed versions; the album was produced by Key Sounds Label. Reception and legacy According to a national ranking of how well bish≈çjo games sold nationally in Japan, the original Kanon release for Windows achieved its highest rank at number two in the ranking. Three years later in June 2002, the original release ranked in again at 45, and then again at 46 the following two weeks. The original release also made the ranking after that at number 41 in early July 2002. The Kanon Standard Edition premiered at number 16 in the rankings. The Kanon Standard Edition remained on the top 50 list for the next two months, achieving the rankings of 47 and 35. The all ages version of the Kanon Standard Edition premiered at number 42 on the national ranking, went up to 35 the next month, and did not appear on the rankings after that. The Dreamcast port sold 42,379 units in the first week and was the fourth top selling console game in Japan for that week. Kanon has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms, not counting the PSP release. Five days before the first PS2 release for Kanon, a PS2 printer called Tapis MPR-505 went on sale which enabled the user to print out game screens. Kanon was one of the three games supported at launch, the other two being America ≈åden Ultra Quiz from DigiCube and Marle de Jigsaw from Nippon Ichi Software. The first PS2 release in 2002 was reviewed by the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu where the game received an overall score of 29/40 (out of the four individual review scores of 7, 8, 7, and 7). Y≈´ichi Suzumoto commented in an interview in March 2001 that he felt the end of Kanon's story could be summed up as \\"the prince and princess live happily ever after. The end,\\" resulting in an ending that does not expand on what could possibly happen afterwards. In the October 2007 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, poll results for the 50 best bish≈çjo games were released. Out of 249 titles, Kanon ranked fifth with 71 votes. Characters from Kanon have appeared in several d≈çjin games not directly based on the Kanon series such as the Eternal Fighter Zero game by Twilight Frontier where most of the playable characters either came from Kanon or from One: Kagayaku Kisetsu e. The d≈çjin game Glove on Fight featured at least two Kanon characters: Ayu Tsukimiya and Akiko Minase in a fighting style game along with various other characters taken from other media. The character Ayu Tsukimiya in particular is known to appear in works outside Kanon, such as in strip 67 of the webcomic Megatokyo where Ayu is shown eating taiyaki. The second Kanon anime series was reviewed at Anime News Network where Theron Martin commented how the series is a \\"formulaic moe haremfest\\", and how the moe aspects of the series may make viewers \\"feel like they're drowning in a vat of gooey cuteness\\". The series is described as being similar to the anime television adaptation of Air, saying \\"Like Air, the first four episodes can be simply summarized as 'male lead arrives in town and kills time interacting with cute girls.' Unlike Air, however, these interactions can occasionally be very funny.\\" Martin also compares Kanon to the anime adaptation of Shuffle! which is described as \\"bombing\\" where Kanon \\"works\\". The reviewer chalks this up to the characters \\"endear[ing] themselves to the viewer...far better than what Shuffle!'s do.\\" Martin cites the transition between humor and serious content as a defining feature of the series. However, Martin comments how one of the series' flaws is how it \\"overplays the mundane cutesiness and moe cards at times\\" causing little to happen with the plot. Yuichi is described as being \\"too erratic to be fully credible\\" or easily believable. Despite the series' drawbacks, Martin still describes the series as \\"one of the best moe-centric series to date\\" and lauds Kyoto Animation's production values making Kanon \\"one of the prettiest-looking anime series of the past year\\". Martin adds another series comparison, citing Kanon as the \\"polar opposite of Gurren Lagann\\", which deals primarily in its action- oriented content.

She has been described as \\"the pre-eminent British folk rock singer\\". After briefly working with the Strawbs, Denny joined Fairport Convention in 1968, remaining with them until 1969. She formed the short-lived band Fotheringay in 1970, before focusing on a solo career. Between 1971 and 1977, Denny released four solo albums: The North Star Grassman and the Ravens, Sandy, Like an Old Fashioned Waltz and Rendezvous. She also duetted with Robert Plant on \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" for Led Zeppelin's album Led Zeppelin IV in 1971. Denny died in 1978 at the age of 31 due to injuries and health issues related to alcohol abuse. Music publications Uncut and Mojo have called Denny Britain's finest female singer-songwriter.Nigel Williamson (November 2004), \\"Glittering Prize\\", Uncut, p. 134.Cliff Jones (September 1995); \\"Forensic dissection of the human heart\\", Mojo, p. 110. Her composition \\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\\" has been recorded by Judy Collins, Eva Cassidy, Nina Simone, 10,000 Maniacs and Cat Power. Her recorded work has been the subject of numerous reissues, along with a wealth of previously unreleased material which has appeared over the more than 40 years since her death, most notably including a 19-CD box set which was released in November 2010. Childhood Denny was born on 6 January 1947 at Nelson Hospital, Kingston Road, Merton Park, London, to Neil and Edna Denny. She studied classical piano as a child. Her paternal grandfather was from Dundee, Scotland and her paternal grandmother was a Scots Gaelic speaker and singer of traditional songs. At an early age Denny showed an interest in singing, although her strict parents were reluctant to believe there was a living to be made from it. Sandy Denny attended Coombe Girls' School in New Malden. After leaving school, she started training as a nurse at the Royal Brompton Hospital.Patrick Humphries (1982) Meet on the Ledge: A History of Fairport Convention, London: Eel Pie Publishing Ltd; Early career Her nursing career proved short- lived. In the meantime she had secured a place on a foundation course at Kingston College of Art, which she took up in September 1965, becoming involved with the folk club on campus. Her contemporaries at the college included guitarist and future member of Pentangle, John Renbourn. After her first public appearance at the Barge in Kingston upon Thames Denny started working the folk club circuit in the evenings with an American-influenced repertoire, including songs by Tom Paxton, together with traditional folk songs. Denny made the first of many appearances for the BBC at Cecil Sharp House on 2 December 1966 on the Folk Song Cellar programme where she accompanied herself on two traditional songs: \\"Fir a Bhata\\" and \\"Green Grow the Laurels\\". Her earliest professional recordings were made a few months later in mid-1967 for the Saga label, featuring traditional songs and covers of folk contemporaries including her boyfriend of this period, the American singer-songwriter Jackson C. Frank. They were released on the albums Alex Campbell and His Friends and Sandy and Johnny with Johnny Silvo. These songs were collected on the 1970 album It's Sandy Denny where the tracks from Sandy and Johnny had been re-recorded with more accomplished vocals and guitar playing. The complete Saga studio recordings were issued on the 2005 compilation Where The Time Goes. By this time she had abandoned her studies at art college and was devoting herself full-time to music. While she was performing at The Troubadour folk club, a member of the Strawbs heard her, and in 1967, she was invited to join the band. She recorded one album with them in Denmark which was released belatedly in 1973 credited to Sandy Denny and the Strawbs: All Our Own Work. The album includes an early solo version of her best-known (and widely recorded) composition, \\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\\" A demo of that song found its way into the hands of American singer Judy Collins, who chose to cover it as the title track of an album of her own, released in November 1968, thus giving Denny international exposure as a songwriter before she had become widely known as a singer. From Fairport to Fotheringay After making the Saga albums with Alex Campbell and Johnny Silvo, Denny looked for a band that would allow her to stretch herself as a vocalist, reach a wider audience, and have the opportunity to display her songwriting. She said, \\"I wanted to do something more with my voice.\\"Clinton Heylin. No More Sad Refrains ‚Äì The Life and Times of Sandy Denny. London, Helter Skelter, 2002, p. 64; After working briefly with the Strawbs, Denny remained unconvinced that they could provide that opportunity, and so she ended her relationship with the band. Fairport Convention conducted auditions in May 1968 for a replacement singer following the departure of Judy Dyble after their debut album, and Denny became the obvious choice. According to group member Simon Nicol, her personality and musicianship made her stand out from the other auditionees \\"like a clean glass in a sink full of dirty dishes\\". Beginning with What We Did on Our Holidays, the first of three albums she made with the band in the late 1960s, Denny is credited with encouraging Fairport Convention to explore the traditional British folk repertoire, and is thus regarded as a key figure in the development of British folk rock. She brought with her the traditional repertoire she had refined in the clubs, including \\"A Sailor's Life\\" featured on their second album together Unhalfbricking. Framing Denny's performance of this song with their own electric improvisations, her bandmates discovered what then proved to be the inspiration for an entire album, the influential Liege & Lief (1969).Brian Hinton and Geoff Wall, Ashley Hutchings: The Authorised Biography ‚Äì The Guv‚Äônor and the Rise of Folk-Rock, 1945‚Äì1973. London: Helter Skelter, 2002, p. 111. Denny left Fairport Convention in December 1969 to develop her own songwriting more fully. To this end, she formed her own band, Fotheringay, which included her future husband, Australian Trevor Lucas, formerly of the group Eclection. They created one self-titled album, which included an eight- minute version of the traditional \\"Banks of the Nile\\", and several Denny originals, among them \\"The Sea\\" and \\"Nothing More\\". The latter marked her first composition on the piano, which was to become her primary instrument from then on. Fotheringay started to record a second album in late 1970, but it remained unfinished after Denny announced that she was leaving the group and producer Joe Boyd left to take up a job at Warner Brothers in California. Denny would later blame Boyd's hostility towards the group for its demise. Solo career and final years She then turned to recording her first solo album, The North Star Grassman and the Ravens. Released in 1971, it is distinguished by its elusive lyrics and unconventional harmonies. Highlights included \\"Late November\\", inspired by a dream and the death of Fairport band member Martin Lamble, and \\"Next Time Around\\" a cryptogram about Jackson C. Frank, one of her many portraits in song.Philip Ward, Sandy Denny: Reflections on Her Music. Leicester: Troubador, 2011, pp. 175‚Äì6, 185. Sandy, with a cover photograph by David Bailey, followed in 1972 and was the first of her albums to be produced by Trevor Lucas. As well as introducing eight new original compositions, the album marked her last recording of a traditional song, \\"The Quiet Joys of Brotherhood\\" (words by Richard Fari√±a), with Denny's ambitious multi-tracked vocal arrangement inspired by the Ensemble of the Bulgarian Republic. Melody Maker readers twice voted her the \\"Best British Female Singer\\", in 1970 and 1971 and, together with contemporaries including Richard Thompson and Ashley Hutchings, she participated in a one-off project called the Bunch to record a collection of rock and roll era standards released under the title of Rock On. In 1971, Denny duetted with Robert Plant on \\"The Battle of Evermore\\", which was included on Led Zeppelin's 1971 album (Led Zeppelin IV); she was the only guest vocalist ever to appear on a Led Zeppelin album. In 1972 Denny had a small cameo on Lou Reizner's symphonic arrangement of the Who's rock opera Tommy. Her brief appearance was at the end of the track \\"It's a Boy\\", which also featured vocals from Pete Townshend. In 1973, she married long-term boyfriend and producer Trevor Lucas and recorded a third solo album, Like an Old Fashioned Waltz. The songs continued to detail many of her personal preoccupations: loss, loneliness, fear of the dark, the passing of time and the changing seasons. The album contained one of her best loved compositions, \\"Solo\\", and featured a cover image by Gered Mankowitz. A Moveable Feast, 26 October 1974 In 1974, she returned to Fairport Convention (of which her husband was by then a member) for a world tour (captured on the 1974 album Fairport Live Convention) and a studio album, Rising for the Moon in 1975. Although her development as a soloist and songwriter had taken her further away from the folk roots direction that the band had pursued since Liege & Lief, seven of the eleven tracks on Rising for the Moon were either written or co-written by her. Denny and Lucas left Fairport Convention at the end of 1975 and embarked on what was to become her final album Rendezvous. Released in 1977, the album sold poorly and Denny was subsequently dropped by Island Records. Having relocated to the village of Byfield in Northamptonshire in the mid-seventies, Denny gave birth to her only child, a daughter named Georgia, in July 1977. A UK tour to promote Rendezvous in autumn 1977 marked her final public appearances. The closing night at the Royalty Theatre in London on 27 November 1977 was recorded for a live album, Gold Dust, which, because of technical problems in the recording of the electric guitar, was belatedly released in 1998 after most of the guitars had been re-recorded by Jerry Donahue. Death Linda Thompson would later note that Denny \\"really started going downhill in 1976\\" and demonstrated increasing levels of both manic and depressive behaviour. Learning that she was pregnant did little to mellow Denny's reckless lifestyle, which was heightened by increasing depression, mood swings and the unravelling of her \\"tumultuous\\" marriage to Trevor Lucas.Mick Houghton. I've Always Kept a Unicorn ‚Äì The Biography of Sandy Denny. Faber & Faber, 2015, p. 393-397; She abused drugs and alcohol while pregnant with her daughter, Georgia, who was born prematurely in July 1977. Much like her moods, Denny's interest towards her daughter appeared to oscillate between obsessive and unconcerned; friends recalled both frantic, middle-of-the-night phone calls about teething, as well as Denny \\"crashing the car and leaving the baby in the pub and all sorts of stuff\\". Sandy Denny's grave at Putney Vale Cemetery, London, in 2014 Friends would later note that Denny had a history of purposefully throwing herself off bar stools and down flights of stairs in order to get a reaction. Several remembered this behaviour as \\"Sandy's party trick\\", while Dave Pegg's wife Chris stated, \\"She certainly did it in my house and it could be a very dramatic gesture, like self-harming. She could do it without hurting herself usually but I had a feeling there would be one time too many.\\"Mick Houghton. I've Always Kept a Unicorn ‚Äì The Biography of Sandy Denny. Faber & Faber, 2015, p. 401-403; Those who knew Denny said that her increasing level of alcohol abuse in the last years of her life led to an increasing number of falls (both accidental and on purpose), resulting in a growing number of injuries. A short piece about Sandy Denny's death has been published on the web by Veronica Jill Broun (nee Conway), a close friend of Sandy Denny. The extract is taken from her book Peregrine - A Pilgrimage to a Holy Place and discusses events surrounding the last days of Sandy's life. In late March 1978, while on holiday with her parents and baby Georgia in Cornwall, Denny was injured when she fell down a staircase and hit her head on concrete. Following the incident, she suffered from intense headaches; a doctor prescribed her the painkiller dextropropoxyphene, a drug known to have fatal side effects when mixed with alcohol. On 1 April, several days after the fall in Cornwall, Denny performed a charity concert at Byfield. The final song she performed was \\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\\" At some unknown point during the first half of April 1978, Denny suffered yet another major fall at her home in Byfield. On 13 April, concerned about his wife's erratic behaviour and fearing for his daughter's safety, Trevor Lucas left the UK and returned to his native Australia with their child, leaving Sandy without telling her.Clinton Heylin. No More Sad Refrains ‚Äì The Life and Times of Sandy Denny. London, Helter Skelter, 2002, pp. 6‚Äì7; He sold their Austin Princess car in order to raise funds for the journey. On discovering Lucas' departure, Denny went to stay at the home of her friend Miranda Ward. During this time, Denny apparently set up an appointment to speak with a doctor about her headaches, and also intended to get advice about her alcohol addiction.Mick Houghton. I've Always Kept a Unicorn ‚Äì The Biography of Sandy Denny. Faber & Faber, 2015, p. 405‚Äì409; At some point after 8 am on 17 April, Denny fell into a coma. Ward was out of the house at the time, and had asked her friend Jon Cole (of the band The Movies) to check in on Denny. Cole entered the home at 3 pm, and found Denny unconscious at the foot of the staircase which led to the second floor of the house. She was rushed by ambulance to Queen Mary's Hospital in nearby Roehampton. On 19 April, she was transferred to Atkinson Morley Hospital in Wimbledon. After receiving news that Denny was in a coma, Lucas returned from Australia. Upon his arrival at the hospital, doctors informed him that Denny was effectively brain-dead and her condition would not improve. He granted their recommendation to turn off life-support machines, and Sandy Denny died at 7:50 pm on 21 April 1978. Her death was ruled to be the result of a traumatic mid-brain haemorrhage and blunt force trauma to her head. Denny was 31 years old. The funeral took place on 27 April 1978 at Putney Vale Cemetery. After the vicar had read Denny's favourite psalm, Psalm 23, a piper played \\"Flowers of the Forest\\", a traditional song commemorating the fallen of Flodden Field and one which had appeared on the 1970 Fairport album Full House. The inscription on her headstone reads: Posthumous releases =Official releases= Although Denny had a devoted following in her lifetime, she did not achieve mass market success. In the years since her death, her reputation has grown. A four-album box set entitled Who Knows Where the Time Goes? (1985) was produced by her widower Trevor Lucas and Joe Boyd and included a number of rare and previously unreleased tracks by Denny, either solo or with Fairport Convention (1968, 1969, 1974) and Fotheringay (1970). This was the first public indication that a large cache of unreleased material existed. A one-disc subset of these recordings was subsequently issued on CD by Island in 1987 entitled The Best Of Sandy Denny. In 1987, a compilation of previously unreleased tracks recorded for the BBC by incarnations of Fairport including Denny was released on LP under the title Heyday, which was subsequently released on CD in 2001 and again, with extra tracks, in 2002; all tracks were later included, with others, on the 2007 4-CD box set Fairport Convention Live at the BBC (see below). The initial purpose of this compilation was to document the more \\"American\\" material performed live by the What We Did on Our Holidays lineup of the band that never made it to vinyl, while the re-releases added additional songs as performed by the Unhalfbricking and Liege and Lief lineups. Also in 1987, a VHS documentary, It All Comes 'Round Again, on Fairport Convention was released which contained excerpts of several audio recordings featuring Denny, plus a single poor- quality video recording of her singing her song \\"Solo\\" during her second stint with Fairport in 1974, as filmed by the University of Birmingham's \\"Guild TV\\" amateur organisation. The original tape of this recording has apparently been lost; however, \\"Like an Old Fashioned Waltz\\" does appear on the DVD documentary Sandy Denny Under Review (see below) and other tracks have been made available via YouTube in very poor quality. Over the period 1988‚Äì1994, the Australian \\"Friends of Fairport\\" issued a series of subscriber-only cassette compilations drawing in the main on previously unreleased tapes from Trevor Lucas' collection (as stored in his attic in fact). Attic Tracks (AT) 1 (1988) contained out-takes from Sandy as well as some Fairport material and a few bizarre extras; AT 2 (1989) contained only Trevor Lucas material, no Denny; AT 3 (1989) entitled First and Last Tracks comprised 1966‚Äì1967 home demos and rare radio tracks, as well as 9 \\"pre-overdub\\" songs from Dennys's last concert at the Royalty Theatre, London, on 27 November 1977 (a partial alternative to the later, overdubbed CD release Gold Dust), and AT 4 (1994): Together Again comprised one side of Lucas and the other of Denny in the form of more home demos, studio outtakes, and 4 tracks from a 1973 BBC radio concert. A cut-down version of these tracks (18 songs) was subsequently compiled for CD release by the Australian label Raven Records in 1995 called Sandy Denny, Trevor Lucas and Friends: The Attic Tracks 1972‚Äì1984. In 1991, Joe Boyd issued a new version of Denny's All Our Own Work album with the Strawbs, called Sandy Denny and the Strawbs, on his Hannibal Records label. The album had strings added to some tracks, including \\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\\" and further tracks with Denny on lead vocal. In 1997, a one-disc compilation of Denny's solo BBC recordings was released as The BBC Sessions 1971‚Äì1973 on Strange Fruit Records. Due to rights issues it was withdrawn on the day of release, thereby creating a highly collectible disc (up until the release of the comprehensive Live at the BBC box set in 2007). This release was followed in 1998 when Denny's final performance at the Royalty Theatre, entitled Gold Dust, was issued on CD, following a degree of re-recording and overdubbing of selected backing parts to replace reportedly unsatisfactory originals. In 1999, a single-disc compilation, Listen Listen ‚Äì An Introduction to Sandy Denny, was released on Island Records comprising 17 previously released tracks taken from her four Island solo albums. No More Sad Refrains: The Anthology was released by Universal Records in 2000. When first released, this compilation had several rare tracks, including \\"The Ballad of Easy Rider\\" from the Liege and Lief sessions, \\"Learning the Game\\" and \\"When Will I Be Loved\\" from the Bunch album Rock On, \\"Here in Silence\\" and \\"Man of Iron\\" from the Pass of Arms soundtrack, and a previously unissued demo of \\"Stranger to Himself\\". In 2002, a previously unreleased, 2-CD live US concert recording by Fairport Convention from 1974 featuring Denny was released on the Burning Airlines label. Entitled Before The Moon, it originated from a radio broadcast from Ebbets Field in Denver, Colorado, on 23/24 May 1974. The second disc was a limited release bonus with the original release comprising the second set from the same concert. This recording was re-released in shortened form as a single disc in 2011 on the It's About Music label entitled Fairport Convention with Sandy Denny: Ebbets Field 1974. Also in 2002, the American A&M; Records issued a budget-price \\"20th Century Masters\\" compilation called The Best of Sandy Denny with 10 tracks all available on Denny's studio albums. In 2004 a second comprehensive five-CD box set was released on the Fledg'ling record label called A Boxful of Treasures that included many unreleased recordings, in particular a whole disc of acoustic demos, many recorded at her home in Byfield that was highly prized amongst fans and critics alike, who had long asserted that her solo performances showed her work in its best light, revealing the true quality of her vocal style and compositions. Also in 2004, the Spectrum label issued a 16-track compilation of previously released material entitled The Collection: Chronological Covers & Concert Classics, including a mix of studio recordings and live excerpts from the Gold Dust Royalty concert. In 2005, remastered versions of all Denny's solo albums came out with bonus tracks. Also in 2005, a single CD compilation entitled Where the Time Goes: Sandy '67 was released on Castle Music containing all of Saga's Denny album tracks (including the alternative recordings on It's Sandy Denny), together with two self accompanied tracks from Denny's recordings with the Strawbs. A DVD documentary entitled Sandy Denny Under Review was released on the Sexy Intellectual label in 2006 which contained interviews with her contemporaries plus brief excerpts from her audio recordings, plus some short video clips including two of the poor quality video recordings with Fairport from Birmingham University (details given above), two with Fotheringay from German TV's Beat-Club (further details given below), and three solo excerpts from the only surviving BBC footage on One In Ten (details as given in the next item). A 4-disc box set, Sandy Denny Live at the BBC, came out in September 2007 containing (virtually) all of the known solo recordings made by Denny for that UK broadcaster including two complete concerts, one at the Paris Theatre in 1972 and one recorded for Sounds on Sunday in 1973, plus a range of other material spanning the years 1966‚Äì1973. It was praised by The Sun newspaper.'Sandy Denny Live at the BBC' \\"(Denny died) without ever knowing the affection and respect she came to be held in. So she'd no doubt be thrilled how fans clamour for albums like this ... (where) Denny's wonderful voice and astonishing songwriting ability shine through\\" review by SJC, 21 September 2007, The Sun, p. 6. Disc 3 of this set was a DVD containing surviving TV footage from a 1971 BBC One in Ten session comprising solo performances by Denny of \\"The North Star Grassman and the Ravens\\", \\"Crazy Lady Blues\\" and \\"Late November\\", along with digitised excerpts from her diaries, rare photos and a discography. A 1-disc subset of this box set entitled The Best of the BBC Recordings was subsequently released in 2008. A companion box set, Fairport Convention Live at the BBC, also came out in 2007 and covered equivalent live recordings by Fairport over the period 1968‚Äì1974, of which the first two discs (1968‚Äì1970) contain examples from Denny's time with that group. In 2008, Jerry Donahue completed the unfinished second Fotheringay album begun in the autumn of 1970. It was released to general acclaim as Fotheringay 2 and contained some notable Denny performances, in particular earlier versions of two Denny compositions, \\"Late November\\" and \\"John the Gun\\", and performances of the traditional songs \\"Gypsy Davey\\" and \\"Wild Mountain Thyme\\". Also in 2008, Island Remasters issued a double CD entitled The Music Weaver (Sandy Denny Remembered) which contained a mix of better known tracks and less well known demos and live recordings, previously released but not in companion with studio sessions. This compilation is also one of the very few to contain the Led Zeppelin track \\"The Battle Of Evermore\\" which features a rare guest appearance by Denny. In 2010, a large 19-CD retrospective box set, simply titled Sandy Denny, was released by Universal/Island Records in a limited edition of 3,000. It contained Denny's entire catalogue of studio recordings, including her work with the Strawbs, Fairport Convention, Fotheringay and as a solo artist. The compilation also included a large number of outtakes, demos, live recordings, radio sessions and interviews. The box set was released to good reviews, including a 5-star review in Uncut and a 4-star review in The Guardian among others. In late 2010, Thea Gilmore was commissioned by Denny's estate, in conjunction with Island Records, to write melodies to unrecorded lyrics found in Denny's papers. The resulting album, Don't Stop Singing, was released in November 2011 to generally good notices, including 4-star reviews in The Independent and The Guardian among others. On 21 April 2012, the single \\"London\\" was released as an exclusive Record Store Day 7‚Ä≥ single. Further recordings were released in 2011 including a German recording of Fotheringay in concert released as Essen 1970 on the Garden of Delights label. The performance was remastered by original band member Jerry Donahue. This release was followed by 19 Rupert Street, a home recording of a rehearsal featuring Sandy and Alex Campbell recorded at his flat in August 1967. This release is notable for the fact that Sandy performs a number of tracks that are not available in any other versions, including a cover of \\"Fairytale Lullaby\\" by John Martyn. This CD was put out by Sandy's former Strawbs bandmate Dave Cousins on his Witchwood label. 2-disc \\"Deluxe Editions\\" of Denny's album reissues appeared in 2011‚Äì2012 with additional tracks; the 2012 Deluxe Edition of Sandy included a previously unreleased 8-song solo set from her 1973 U.S. tour recorded at Ebbet's Field in Denver, Colorado. A similar 2-disc reissue of Fairport Convention's Rising for the Moon also included, for the first time, the complete 1974 L.A. Troubadour performance of Fairport with Denny back on board, prior to the official announcement of her re-joining the group. On account of unprecedented demand for, and exhaustion of supply of the limited edition 19-CD set cited above, in October 2012 a limited edition 4-CD version was released entitled The Notes and The Words: A Collection of Demos and Rarities, containing \\"75 songs that represent the cream of the rarities, demos and outtakes from the box set\\". Limited to 3,500 copies, this compilation is also now out-of-print. In 2013, Spectrum records issued a single-disc CD entitled The Lady ‚Äì The Essential Sandy Denny that comprised 15 previously issued tracks, generally from Denny's well known albums. 2014 saw the release of another Fairport live U.S. radio broadcast from their 1974 tour with Denny, on RockBeat Records, entitled Live 1974 (My Father's Place), comprising 11 live tracks, most featuring Denny, recorded at the New York rock club \\"My Father's Place\\". A four-disc Fotheringay retrospective, Nothing More: The Collected Fotheringay, was released on 30 March 2015. This is the most comprehensive compilation of the group‚Äôs recordings, and contains, in addition to all the tracks on Fotheringay and Fotheringay 2 as both final studio versions and demos/alternate takes, the complete live concert set from Rotterdam in 1970 (including several previously unreleased tracks), seven Fotheringay tracks recorded in session for BBC radio (which had previously circulated only as bootlegs), plus a DVD disc containing 4 performances by Fotheringay recorded for the German \\"Beat-Club\\" TV series in 1970, which considerably augment the otherwise sparse known TV footage of Denny in particular. May 2016 saw the release of a 2-CD compilation, I've Always Kept A Unicorn ‚Äì The Acoustic Sandy Denny which collected together many previously released, but dispersed, acoustic and/or demo versions of songs better known from their album counterparts, as well as three previously unreleased demos (with Linda Thompson, then Linda Peters) from 1972's Rock On sessions by one- off band The Bunch. A 7-CD box set by Fairport Convention entitled Come All Ye ‚Äì The First 10 Years was released in July 2017 and contains a small number of additional, previously unreleased demos and alternate takes featuring Denny during her first tenure with the band over the period 1968‚Äì1969. Tracks not previously available include versions of Joni Mitchell's Eastern Rain, an a capella version of Nottamun Town, alternative takes of Autopsy and Who Knows Where the Time Goes, and a rehearsal version of The Deserter. =Unofficial releases= In addition to the authorised material listed above, a number unofficial/unauthorised compilations exist plus a range of audience recordings of varying quality, none of which would likely see the light of day as commercial issues but are of interest to a sector of Denny's audience on either historic or aesthetic grounds, often providing alternative views of songs known otherwise only from their commercially released versions. The first available unauthorised/bootleg CDs available in the 1980s and 1990s comprised principally off-air and other obscure material under such titles as Borrowed Thyme, Poems from Alexandra, Dark the Night, Wild Mountain Thyme and One Last Sad Refrain; such compilations are now largely superseded by the subsequent availability of most of the off-air material in much better quality as official releases as described above. Of more enduring interest are audience tapes of shows of which no \\"official\\" tapes survive. These include a performance by Fotheringay at the 1970 Tenth National Jazz and Blues Festival, held at Plumpton Race Track, Streat, East Sussex, England; \\"solo\\" shows by Denny (on occasion with a small band including, among others, Richard Thompson) at the 1971 Lincoln Folk Festival and at the Eltham Well Hall Open Theatre in 1972; performances from York University and Guildhall, Newcastle upon Tyne, also in 1972; an early 1972 U.S. performance from The Bitter End in New York; and several sets (Birmingham and Croydon) from her final 1977 tour in addition to the officially released Gold Dust album. The majority of these can be fairly easily located via relevant internet searches and, in addition, can be readily downloaded from archival music servers such as Sugarmegs (Sandy Denny concerts listed under \\"S\\": SugarMegs Streaming Server, Fairport and Fotheringay under \\"F\\": SugarMegs Streaming Server). Legacy =Estate and family= After relocating to Australia and remarrying, Trevor Lucas died of a heart attack in 1989. Denny's estate is now managed by Lucas' widow, Elizabeth Hurtt-Lucas. A number of otherwise unreleased recordings of Sandy Denny from his collection have subsequently been the basis for posthumous releases of Denny's work including those on The Attic Tracks and elsewhere. Sandy Denny's daughter, Georgia, has rarely spoken about her mother in a public forum and in the mid-2000s declined an invitation to write the liner notes for Sandy Denny Live at the BBC. However, in 2006 she flew to Britain from Australia to accept on her mother's behalf the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards award for Most Influential Folk Album of All Time, which was given for Fairport Convention's Liege and Lief. Georgia gave birth to twin daughters on 29 April 1997, and a tribute album, Georgia on Our Mind, featuring many of Sandy Denny's former bandmates and friends, was compiled in the children's honour. She also administers a Facebook page \\"Sandy Denny and Family\\" dedicated to her mother's memory and more recently, under the name Georgia Katt, has released some of her own DJ- based music. =Tributes= Since her death, many tributes have been made to Denny, both in music and elsewhere. Dave Pegg of Fairport Convention recorded the tribute \\"Song for Sandy\\" on his 1983 solo album The Cocktail Cowboy Goes It Alone. Dave Cousins of the Strawbs wrote \\"Ringing Down the Years\\" in memory of Denny shortly after her death. Songs more specific to the death were Bert Jansch's \\"Where Did My Life Go\\" and Richard Thompson's \\"Did She Jump or Was She Pushed?\\" Fellow Brit folk pioneers Spriguns changed the title of their 1978 album to Magic Lady after hearing of Denny's death while recording.Sleeve notes from the CD release of Mandy Morton and Spriguns, Magic Lady (1994). In 1998, a variety of Daylily was named after her. Denny's songs have been covered by numerous artists in the years since her death. Some of the notable acts to have covered her music include Yo La Tengo, former Marillion frontman Fish, who covered \\"Solo\\" on his album Songs from the Mirror, Cat Power, Judy Collins, Nanci Griffith and Nina Simone. Kate Bush mentioned Denny in the lyric of \\"Blow Away (For Bill)\\", a track on her 1980 album Never for Ever. In 1984, Clann Eadair released the single \\"A tribute to Sandy Denny\\", featuring Phil Lynott on vocals. Several radio specials have been produced about Denny's life and music, including BBC Radio 2's The Sandy Denny Story: Who Knows Where the Time Goes. In 2007, Denny's song \\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\\" also received BBC Radio 2's 2007 Folk Award for \\"Favourite Folk Track of All Time.\\" In 2010, she was recognized by NPR in their 50 Great Voices special series. In April 2008, a tribute concert was held at The Troubadour in London, to mark the thirtieth anniversary of Denny's death. Those taking part included Martin Carthy, Linda Thompson and Joe Boyd. A more extensive tribute was given later that year in December at the Southbank in the Queen Elizabeth Hall called The Lady: A Tribute to Sandy Denny with a band composed of members of Bellowhead, the evening featured a mix of young folk acts like Jim Moray and Lisa Knapp alongside those that had known and worked with Denny such as Dave Swarbrick and Jerry Donahue. These acts were joined by performers from outside the world of folk like PP Arnold and Marc Almond. The concert, which primarily featured songs written by Denny, received a four-star review in The Guardian. In May 2012 the Southbank concert was expanded into an eight date UK tour called The Lady: A Homage to Sandy Denny. The tour showcased Sandy's entire songbook taking in her work with Fairport Convention, Fotheringay, her solo career and the new songs completed by Thea Gilmore on her album Don't Stop Singing. The band was once more composed of members of Bellowhead. Other acts performing included the aforementioned Thea Gilmore, up and coming folk acts Lavinia Blackwall of Trembling Bells, Blair Dunlop and Sam Carter, alongside more established folk stars Maddy Prior, Dave Swarbrick and Jerry Donahue. The line-up was completed with performers not normally associated with the folk scene; Green Gartside, Joan Wasser aka Joan As Police Woman and PP Arnold. The tour was well received, getting a four-star review in the Times. The London concert at the Barbican was filmed for BBC4 and broadcast in a 90-minute programme called 'The Songs of Sandy Denny' in November 2012. In the 2012 Irish film Silence (Harvest Films & South Wind Blows), \\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes\\" is used during the film and final credits. In April 2016 Denny was inducted into the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards Hall of Fame. Alela Diane recorded the tribute \\"Song for Sandy\\" on her album \\"Cusp\\" released in February 2018. The song reflects on Denny's final tragic days and her orphaned baby daughter.The Guardian's review of Alela Diane's album Cusp =Loss of material= On 25 June 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Sandy Denny among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire.

After the death of his father, he took over part of his father's role and became the chairman of Hyundai Asan, the company in charge of various business ventures between North and South Korea. He committed suicide in 2003. Professional career Chung Mong-hun joined Hyundai Heavy Industries in 1975, becoming president of the company's shipping interests by 1981. His father, Hyundai Group founder Chung Ju-yung, was impressed by his management style and put him in charge of the company's electronics division in 1982. In 1997, Chung Ju-yung appointed Mong-hun as the group's co-chairman. In 2000, after Ju-yung's eldest son, Mong-koo, attempted to oust Mong-hun, Ju-yung made Mong-hun the group's sole chairman. Later that year, Ju-yung announced that he and his sons would resign from all management positions at Hyundai companies, except Mong-hun would remain the chair of Hyundai Asan. However, Mong-koo remained the chairman of Hyundai Motors and Kia Motors. Chung Mong-hun was appointed by his father, who was born in Japan-controlled North Korea, to handle Hyundai business with the government of North Korea. He took pride in this position, and reportedly decorated his office with photographs of Hyundai officials meeting with Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang, as well as photos of himself showing Kim around a North Korean resort that Hyundai operated. Scandal and suicide In June 2003, Chung was for his role in the \\"cash-for-summit scandal\\", on charges of doctoring company books to hide the secret money transfers of millions of dollars by the Kim Dae-jung administration to North Korea to set up the 2000 inter-Korean summit. Facing up to three years in prison after he was forced to testify in court about the money transfer days earlier, he committed suicide on August 4, 2003 by leaping from his 12th floor office.

Career Bok's first album, self-titled, was produced by Noel Paul Stookey (Paul of Peter, Paul, and Mary) and released in 1965 on the Verve Records' Verve Folkways subsidiary. His second album, A Tune for November, was released on Sandy Paton's Connecticut-based Folk-Legacy label in 1970. His association with Folk-Legacy has continued since that time, though his more recent work (from the early 1990s on) has been released on his own label, Timberhead Music. Some of his most well-known work was done as part of a trio with Ed Trickett and Ann Mayo Muir, Trickett accompanying with the hammered dulcimer and guitar and Muir with the harp and flute. Bok sings in a baritone and plays six-string guitar (both the steel-string acoustic guitar and the nylon-string classical guitar) and 12-string guitar. He also plays a self-built instrument he calls the \\"cellamba,\\" a six-string, fretted cello. As a songwriter, Bok draws on his experience in and around the working boat culture of the Gulf of Maine. He lyrics include stories of fishermen and other sea-folk. At times (especially in the 1970s), he reaches into the wealth of sea myth of the North Atlantic. In addition to writing songs, he is also a folklorist and gatherer of songs. His repertoire encompasses contemporary songs written by his friends from all over North America, Australia, and the British Isles. As well, Bok sings, in the original languages, folksongs from Italy, Portugal, Mongolia, French Canada, Latin America, and the Gaelic Hebrides, among other places, and knows a huge body of old anglophone folklore. Bok is also an artist mainly dealing with sea themes done in wood carvings. Personal life Bok is the grandson of Edward Bok, the cousin of Derek Bok, and the uncle of Gideon Bok. He is married to Carol Rohl.

Day's obituary in The Guardian by Dick Taverne stated that he was \\"the most outstanding television journalist of his generation. He transformed the television interview, changed the relationship between politicians and television, and strove to assert balance and rationality into the medium's treatment of current affairs\\". Early life Day was born in Hampstead Garden Suburb, London, the youngest of four children, of a Post Office telephone engineer who became a GPO administrative manager. He received his early formal education at Brentwood School from 1934 to 1938, briefly attended the Crypt School, Gloucester, and later Bembridge School on the Isle of Wight. During World War II he received a commission into the British Army's Royal Artillery, with which he served from 1943, being deployed to East Africa, and thereby seeing little action. He was discharged from the British Army in 1947 with the rank of Lieutenant, and went up to St Edmund Hall, Oxford to read law. Whilst at Oxford University he was elected president of the Oxford Union debating society, and also took part in a debating tour of the United States of America, run by the English-Speaking Union. He was called to the Bar at Middle Temple in 1952, but practised law only briefly. Journalistic career Day spent almost his entire working life in journalism. He rose to prominence on the new Independent Television News (ITN) from 1955. According to Dick Taverne, Day first came to notice by interviewing Sir Kenneth Clark, then chairman of the regulator Independent Television Authority. The ITA had proposed to cut ITN's broadcasting hours and finances. His direct, non-deferential approach was then entirely new. Day was the first British journalist to interview Egypt's President Nasser after the Suez Crisis. In 1958, he interviewed Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, in what the Daily Express called: \\"the most vigorous cross-examination a prime minister has been subjected to in public\\". The interview turned Day into a television personality and was probably the first time that British television became a serious part of the political process. He was on the staff of ITN for four years, resigning to stand at the 1959 general election as a Liberal Party candidate for Hereford but was not elected. After a brief period at the News Chronicle, he moved to the BBC. He was a regular fixture on all BBC general election night programmes from the 1960s until 1987. On television, he presented Panorama and chaired Question Time (1979‚Äì89). His incisive and sometimes ‚Äì by the standards of the day ‚Äì abrasive interviewing style, together with his heavy-rimmed spectacles and trademark bow tie, made him an instantly recognisable and frequently impersonated figure over five decades. In the early 1970s, Day was involved on BBC Radio, where he proved an innovator with It's Your Line (1970‚Äì76). This was a national phone-in programme that enabled ordinary people, for the first time, to put questions directly to the Prime Minister and other politicians (it later spawned Election Call). He also presented The World at One from 1979 to 1987. In the 1981 New Year Honours, he was knighted for his services to broadcasting. He became known in British broadcasting as \\"the Grand Inquisitor\\" for his abrasive interviewing of politicians, a style out of keeping with the British media's habitual deference to authority in the early days of his career. In October 1982, during a Newsnight interview with the Conservative Secretary of State for Defence John Nott, pursuing cuts in defence expenditure, in particular Royal Navy, Day posed the question: \\"Why should the public on this issue believe you, a transient, here today and, if I may say so, gone tomorrow politician rather than a senior officer of many years' experience?\\" Nott, who had announced he was to retire at the next general election, removed his own microphone and walked off the set. Nott's autobiography in 2003 was called Here Today Gone Tomorrow: Recollections of an Errant Politician. After leaving Question Time, he moved to the new satellite service BSB where he presented the weekly political discussion programme Now Sir Robin. When BSB merged with Sky Television, the programme continued to be broadcast on Sky News for a while. On the night of the 1992 general election Day resumed his role as interviewer, this time on ITN's general election night coverage, broadcast on ITV. During the mid-1990s he regularly contributed to the lunchtime Channel Four political programme Around the House and also presented Central Lobby for Central, the ITV franchise in the Midlands. That show was sometimes broadcast at the same time as his old programme Question Time was being broadcast by the BBC. For 25 years he campaigned tirelessly, and eventually successfully, for the televising of parliament ‚Äì not in the interests of television, but of parliament itself. He claimed that he was the first to present the detailed arguments in favour, in a Hansard Society paper in 1963.Robin Day, (1963) The Case for Televising Parliament (London: Hansard Society for Parliamentary Government) Monty Python's Flying Circus often referred to Day - for example in the 'Eddie Baby' sketch, in which John Cleese turns to the camera and states: \\"Robin Day's got a hedgehog called Frank\\". In another sketch, Eric Idle said he was able to return his \\"Robin Day tie\\" to Harrods. He was also spoofed (as \\"Robin Yad\\") on The Goodies' episode \\"Saturday Night Grease\\". Day appeared as himself on an installment of the Morecambe & Wise show, in which he berates Ernie Wise in character. Then Eric Morecambe, acting as a TV presenter, says, \\"Sadly, we've come to the end of today's \\"Friendly Discussion with Robin Day\\". He was also frequently lampooned by the satirical TV programme Spitting Image. In this, he would frequently be shown interviewing then-Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher who would always give answers somewhat unrelated to the question. The breathing difficulties which affected him later in life were represented: \\"My name is Robin (deep breath) Day.\\" Day's two autobiographies were entitled Day by Day (1975) and Grand Inquisitor (1989). Death Day died from heart complications, aged 76, on the evening of 6 August 2000 at the Wellington Hospital in London. A funeral service was held at the chapel of Mortlake Crematorium, where his body was cremated. His ashes were buried in a grave near the south door of the Church of St Candida and Holy Cross, at Whitchurch Canonicorum in the county of Dorset. The grave's memorial stone bears the words: \\"In loving memory of Sir Robin Day - The Grand Inquisitor\\". Personal life In 1965, Day married Katherine Ainslie, an Australian law don at St Anne's College, Oxford; the couple had two sons. The marriage was dissolved in 1986. One of the tragedies of his life was that his elder son never fully recovered from the effects of multiple skull fractures he sustained in a childhood fall. In the 1980s, Day had a coronary bypass, and he suffered from breathing problems that were often evident when he was on the air. He had always fought against a tendency to put on weight. As an undergraduate, he weighed , and claimed that, in the course of his life, he had succeeded in losing more weight than any other person. The broadcaster Joan Bakewell recalled that whilst Day was professional when in the office, he possessed an acerbically doubtful view of the increasing tendency in the latter half of the 20th century in British television to use women to present news and current affairs broadcasts primarily upon the basis of their physical attractiveness: \\"Socially he was a menace. There was no subtlety in his manner: at office parties he would attack head on. 'Do the men you interview fancy you? Do they stare at your legs? Do they stare at your breasts? Do you sleep with many of them?' ... Whenever he loomed in sight, I made myself scarce\\".Joan Bakewell, The Centre of the Bed: An Autobiography, 2003, Sceptre, pp. 234-5, Publications * Television: A Personal Report (1961) * Day by Day: A Dose of My Own Hemlock (1975) (autobiography) * The Media and Political Violence, by Richard Clutterbuck (1983; Day wrote the foreword) * The Grand Inquisitor (1989) (autobiography) * ...

Early life and education  Ringenberg was born in Kewanee, Illinois and grew up in nearby Sheffield, Illinois, where his parents owned a family hog farm that bordered the Rock Island Railroad line. He started playing in rock, alternative rock, and country-bands while in school at Southern Illinois University Carbondale.  Career  In 1981, Ringenberg moved to Nashville, Tennessee, where he soon formed Jason and the Scorchers with Warner Hodges, Jeff Johnson, and Perry Baggs. Their potent mix of punk rock and country gained them fans around the world. In the words of Rolling Stone they \\"singlehandedly re-wrote the history of rock'n'roll in the South\\". They won critical approval with the release of successful albums and energetic live performances. Jason & the Scorchers had several hits, including \\"Golden Ball and Chain\\" and a rock version of Bob Dylan's \\"Absolutely Sweet Marie.\\" Ringenberg was influential in the early to mid 1980s when the indie country/rock movement was at its height. His music, along with similar bands, founded the emergence of the alternative country and Americana genres within indie rock music. In 2008, Jason and the Scorchers received the Americana Music Association's Lifetime Achievement Award in the Performance Category. Ringenberg has also seen success as a solo artist. He has released five solo records and toured as a solo artist. The Times (London) called him \\"one of the most exciting performers of his generation.\\" He now performs both solo as Jason Ringenberg and as his children's music character, Farmer Jason, often performing as both personas in the same day. Ringenberg created his children's music character, Farmer Jason, in 2002 to entertain his own daughters. He then released his first children's record on the Yep Roc Records label; A Day at the Farm with Farmer Jason, in 2003. The character remains popular and has become the most successful project of his career. As Farmer Jason, he sings songs about farm animals and the appreciation of nature. His PBS mini program called \\"It's a Farmer Jason\\" has earned four Emmy nominations and one Emmy win. He has recorded four records and a DVD as Farmer Jason. The fourth album, Christmas on the Farm with Farmer Jason, was released in December 2014. His newest album Stand Tall (2019) was written while he was Artist in Residence at Sequoia National Park. Recorded at his old college haunts in Southern Illinois and also in Nashville, the subjects of the songs range from John the Baptist to The Ramones to a disillusioned Confederate draftee. Personal life Ringenberg lives near Bon Aqua, Tennessee, with his wife Suzy; daughters Kelsey, Addie, and Camille; and a barnyard full of animals.

Faust (born 1955 in Fort Riley, Kansas) is a landscape photographer in St. Paul, Minnesota. He holds a degree in biology from St. Cloud State University and an MS in educational media from St. Cloud State University. He is best known for his panoramic photographs of landscapes. From 1990 to 1996 he created a series of black-and-white images of new suburban development, especially in Minnesota, USA. Many of these depict new structures and spaces not yet fully formed, and not yet inhabited by people. A frequent theme in these and other series is the intersection of human beings with nature, and places where the two interact in visually provocative ways. An example is \\"The Edge, Eden Prairie, MN\\" which is in the collection of the Walker Art Center. This photograph appears to be a split, double image, but is actually a single scene, depicting where a suburban development near Minneapolis, Minnesota runs up against prairie vegetation. The imported, landscaped vegetation, especially the central tree, conifers, and lawn grass balance the smaller native tree and prairie grass of the other half, as the condominiums loom from a corner. Other of his series include outdoor industrial scenes typical of the northern Midwest, like grain elevators and railcars, rural landscapes from Minnesota and Appalachia, and color photographs of natural scenes. Faust's work is exhibited regularly in galleries around Minnesota. His work appears in a number of institutions and is held by the permanent collections of the Walker Art Center, Minneapolis Institute of Arts, Weisman Art Museum, and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. thumb Twenty of Faust's photographs, many of them from his Suburban Documentation Project, illustrate the 1997 book Placing Nature: Culture and Landscape Ecology, edited by landscape architect Joan Iverson Nassauer, and including essays by novelist Jane Smiley and philosopher Marcia Muelder Eaton. Faust has been honored with McKnight Foundation Fellowships in 1989, 1992, and 1997. Faust is now a media teacher at Gordon Parks High School, St.Paul MN.. Faust takes a majority of his photographs using a specially designed Fuji G617.

Gagn√©, was originally published in 1965 by Holt, Rinehart and Winston and describes eight kinds of learning and nine events of instruction. This theory of learning involved two steps.Schunk, D. H. 2008. \\"Learning theories:An educational perspective\\", (5th Ed), pp.286-287 The theory stipulates that there are several different types or levels of learning. The significance of these classifications is that each different type requires different types of instruction. Gagn√© identifies five major categories of learning: verbal information, intellectual skills, cognitive strategies, motor skills and attitudes. Different internal and external conditions are necessary for each type of learning. For example, for cognitive strategies to be learned, there must be a chance to practice developing new solutions to problems; to learn attitudes, the learner must be exposed to a credible role model or persuasive arguments. Gagn√© suggests that learning tasks for intellectual skills can be organized in a hierarchy according to complexity: stimulus recognition, response generation, procedure following, use of terminology, discrimination, concept formation, rule application, and problem solving. The primary significance of the hierarchy is to identify prerequisites that should be completed to facilitate learning at each level. Prerequisites are identified by doing a task analysis of a learning/training task. Learning hierarchies provide a basis for the sequencing of instruction. In addition, the theory outlines nine instructional events and corresponding cognitive processes: # Gaining attention (reception) # Informing learners of the objective (expectancy) # Stimulating recall of prior learning (retrieval) # Presenting the stimulus (selective perception) # Providing learning guidance (semantic encoding) # Eliciting performance (responding) # Providing feedback (reinforcement) # Assessing performance (retrieval) # Enhancing retention and transfer (generalization) These events should satisfy or provide the necessary conditions for learning and serve as the basis for designing instruction and selecting appropriate media (Gagn√©, Briggs & Wager, 1992). Application While Gagn√©'s theoretical framework covers all aspects of learning, the focus of the theory is on intellectual skills. The theory has been applied to the design of instruction in all domains (Gagn√© & Driscoll, 1988). In its original formulation (Gagn√©, 1 962), special attention was given to military training settings. Gagn√© (1987) addresses the role of instructional technology in learning.

In Italy and France, it is often served at weddings, baptisms and first communions. Name The name comes from the French phrase croque en bouche, meaning \\"[something that] crunches in the mouth.\\"Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd edition, December 2005, s.v. Presentation A croquembouche is composed of (usually cream-filled) profiteroles piled into a cone and bound with spun sugar. It may also be decorated with other confectionery such as sugared almonds, chocolate, and edible flowers. Sometimes it is covered in macarons or ganache.Croquembouche Delicious Magazine History The invention of the croquembouche is often attributed to Antonin Car√™me, who includes it in his 1815 cookbook Le P√¢tissier royal parisien, but it is mentioned as early as 1806, in Andr√© Viard's culinary encyclopedia Le Cuisinier Imp√©rial, and in Antoine Beauvilliers' 1815 L'Art du Cuisinier. In Viard's encyclopedia and other early texts (e.g. Grimod de La Reyni√®re's, N√©o-physiologie du gout), it is included in lists of entremets‚Äîelaborate dishes, both savory and sweet, that were served between courses during large banquets.

When a material is exposed to an ion beam, atomic interactions occur that give off EM radiation of wavelengths in the x-ray part of the electromagnetic spectrum specific to an element. PIXE is a powerful yet non- destructive elemental analysis technique now used routinely by geologists, archaeologists, art conservators and others to help answer questions of provenance, dating and authenticity. The technique was first proposed in 1970 by Sven Johansson of Lund University, Sweden, and developed over the next few years with his colleagues Roland Akselsson and Thomas B Johansson.Roland Akselsson mini-CV- accessed 2008-01-29 Recent extensions of PIXE using tightly focused beams (down to 1 Œºm) gives the additional capability of microscopic analysis. This technique, called microPIXE, can be used to determine the distribution of trace elements in a wide range of samples. A related technique, particle-induced gamma-ray emission (PIGE) can be used to detect some light elements. Theory Three types of spectra can be collected from a PIXE experiment: # X-ray emission spectrum. # Rutherford backscattering spectrum. # Proton transmission spectrum. =X-ray emission= Quantum theory states that orbiting electrons of an atom must occupy discrete energy levels in order to be stable. Bombardment with ions of sufficient energy (usually MeV protons) produced by an ion accelerator, will cause inner shell ionization of atoms in a specimen. Outer shell electrons drop down to replace inner shell vacancies, however only certain transitions are allowed. X-rays of a characteristic energy of the element are emitted. An energy dispersive detector is used to record and measure these X-rays. Only elements heavier than fluorine can be detected. The lower detection limit for a PIXE beam is given by the ability of the X-rays to pass through the window between the chamber and the X-ray detector. The upper limit is given by the ionisation cross section, the probability of the K electron shell ionisation, this is maximal when the velocity of the proton matches the velocity of the electron (10% of the speed of light), therefore 3 MeV proton beams are optimal. =Proton backscattering= Protons can also interact with the nucleus of the atoms in the sample through elastic collisions, Rutherford backscattering, often repelling the proton at angles close to 180 degrees. The backscatter give information on the sample thickness and composition. The bulk sample properties allow for the correction of X-ray photon loss within the sample. =Proton transmission= The transmission of protons through a sample can also be used to get information about the sample. Channeling is one of processes that can be used to study crystals. Protein analysis Protein analysis using microPIXE allow for the determination of the elemental composition of liquid and crystalline proteins. microPIXE can quantify the metal content of protein molecules with a relative accuracy of between 10% and 20%. The advantage of microPIXE is that given a protein of known sequence, the X-ray emission from sulfur can be used as an internal standard to calculate the number of metal atoms per protein monomer. Because only relative concentrations are calculated there are only minimal systematic errors, and the results are totally internally consistent. The relative concentrations of DNA to protein (and metals) can also be measured using the phosphate groups of the bases as an internal calibration. =Data analysis= Analysis of the data collected can be performed by the programs Dan32,Geoffrey W Grime Dan32: recent developments in the windows interface to gupix. Tenth International Conference on Particle Induced X-ray Emission, Portoroz, Slovenia, 2004 the front end to gupix. =Limitations= In order to get a meaningful sulfur signal from the analysis, the buffer should not contain sulfur (i.e. no BES, DDT, HEPES, MES, MOPSO or PIPES compounds). Excessive amounts of chlorine in the buffer should also be avoided, since this will overlap with the sulfur peak; KBr and NaBr are suitable alternatives. =Advantages= There are many advantages to using a proton beam over an electron beam. There is less crystal charging from Bremsstrahlung radiation, although there is some from the emission of Auger electrons, and there is significantly less than if the primary beam was itself an electron beam. Because of the higher mass of protons relative to electrons, there is less lateral deflection of the beam; this is important for proton beam writing applications. =Scanning= Two- dimensional maps of elemental compositions can be generated by scanning the microPIXE beam across the target. Cell and tissue analysis Whole cell and tissue analysis is possible using a microPIXE beam, this method is also referred to as nuclear microscopy. Artifact analysis MicroPIXE is a useful technique for the non-destructive analysis of paintings and antiques. Although it provides only an elemental analysis, it can be used to distinguish and measure layers within the thickness of an artifact.Grassi, N., et al. Differential PIXE measurements for the stratigraphic analysis of the painting ‚ÄúMadonna dei fusi‚Äù 10th international PIXE conference (2004)- accessed 2008-01-29 Proton beam writing Proton beams can be used for writing (proton beam writing) through either the hardening of a polymer (by proton induced cross-linking), or through the degradation of a proton sensitive material. This may have important effects in the field of nanotechnology.

The ride tells the story of a band of pirates in the West Indies islands around the Caribbean Sea in the 17th and 18th centuries with the saga of their voyages, troubles, and exploits. The original version of the ride was opened at the original Disneyland, in Anaheim, California, near Los Angeles, in 1967, and was the last ride whose construction was envisioned and personally overseen by Walt Disney, who died three months before it opened. After immense popularity, the ride was replicated seven years later at the Magic Kingdom of Walt Disney World, near Orlando, Florida, soon after it opened, in 1973. Versions followed at Tokyo Disneyland in 1983, and at Disneyland Paris in 1992. Each of the initial four versions of the ride has a different fa√ßade but a similar ride experience. A reimagined version of the ride influenced by the visitors' familiarity with the worldwide success of the feature film series, Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure, opened at the Shanghai Disneyland Park in 2016. The ride gave rise to the song \\"Yo Ho (A Pirate's Life for Me)\\" written by George Bruns and Xavier Atencio, and performed on the ride's recording by The Mellomen. The ride became the basis for the Pirates of the Caribbean film series, which debuted in 2003. Since 2006, Disney has incorporated characters from the film series into the Disneyland, Magic Kingdom, Tokyo Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris versions of the rides. History Opening on March 18, 1967, the Disneyland version of Pirates of the Caribbean was the last ride that Walt Disney himself participated in designing, debuting three months after his death. It is located within the New Orleans Square portion of Disneyland, its facade evoking antebellum era New Orleans, topped by a 31-star United States flag (which would indicate the 1850s). It was originally envisioned as a walk- through wax museum; however, with the success of the boat ride concept of It's a Small World at the 1964 New York World's Fair, Disney decided to employ the same ride system on the Pirates of the Caribbean. The ornate initials of Walt Disney and Roy Disney (W.D. and R.D.) can be seen entwined in the wrought iron railings above the ride's entrance at Disneyland. An overhead sign at the boat dock names it for the famous pirate Jean Lafitte (although his name is spelled Laffite as the pirate himself originally spelled it, rather than with the English spelling which has now become standard), who fought alongside the U.S. Army at the Battle of New Orleans in the War of 1812. The second floor of the facade was originally designed to be a private Disney family apartment. However, it later opened in spring 1987 as an art-related retail/museum space called the Disney Gallery and was replaced in late 2007 by the Disneyland Dream Suite. The original installation at Disneyland was manufactured by Arrow Development and Arrow consulted on the next two installations. The ride's passenger carrying boats are very similar to those in a patent assigned to Walt Disney Productions, but filed by Edgar A. Morgan, one of the founders of Arrow Development. Arrow participated in the design and development of many rides at Disneyland from 1953. There are 630,000 gallons of water, 53 audio- animatronic animals and birds, and 75 audio-animatronic pirates and villagers in the ride, and it takes three days to empty and refill the \\"bayou\\" for renovations. Across from the boarding area within the ride is the Blue Bayou Restaurant, made to look like the backyard dinner party of a southern plantation. The restaurant opened the same day as the ride, and is considered one of the original theme restaurants. The debut of Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in 1971 brought many popular rides from Disneyland to the East Coast, but Pirates of the Caribbean was not among them. As the Caribbean region is geographically located near Florida, it was thought a Caribbean- themed ride would not hold the same mystique as it did in California. But Walt Disney World visitors were vocal in their disappointment at the missing ride, leading Disney to quickly announce a Florida version that opened on December 15, 1973. Additional iterations of Pirates of the Caribbean later opened at Disney parks in Tokyo, Paris, and Shanghai. The opening of the Disney Gallery in 1987 also coincided with the ride's outside queue area being completely redone to improve traffic flows. A bridge walkway was built in front of the entrance to allow crowds to pass through New Orleans Square without causing traffic jams with the guests waiting in line for the ride. Ride description = Disneyland = The ride begins amid glimmering fireflies during an evening in a Louisiana bayou. Riders board their boats at Laffite's Landing and are at once afloat in the heart of bayou country, after the safety rules given by Blackbeard. Once past several rickety houseboats, the soft strumming of banjo melodies (including \\"Oh! Susanna\\" and \\"Camptown Races\\") can be heard over the peaceful sounds of nature as guests pass by one houseboat on whose porch an old man calmly rocks back and forth in his rocking chair. Above a stone archway, a talking skull and crossbones provides words of warning. The guests' boat then takes a plunge down a waterfall into a dimly lit cavernous passage, where voices can be heard singing the theme song. After a second plunge further into the depths of an underground grotto known as Dead Man's Cove, guests behold the skeletal remains of an unfortunate band of pirates, guarding their loot and treasure with macabre delight. The boats glide gently past a violent thunderstorm tossing an old pirate ship about, though the ship's pilot is nothing more than a skeleton. The boats pass through the crew's quarters, complete with skeletal pirates frozen in time ‚Äì playing chess, one drinking a bottomless bottle of rum, the captain examining a treasure map, an old harpsichord playing the theme song, and a huge amount of treasure being guarded by another skeleton pirate. The Aztec chest from Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl sits in the corner of the Treasure Room and is the last thing guests see before entering a dark tunnel. In the dark tunnel the boats encounter another pirate skeleton, sitting in a booby trap and clutching a treasure chest, which appears to transform before the riders' eyes into a flesh-and-blood living pirate. Ominous voices boom from above warning of the cursed treasure and what lies ahead. Cannonballs whistle overhead and explosions throw water into the air ‚Äì a fierce battle between a marauding pirate galleon and a Caribbean fortress is in full swing. Captain Barbossa leads the assault from the deck of a pirate vessel named the Wicked Wench. A musical theme, \\"The Medallion Calls\\" from the Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl film plays. From the deck of the Wicked Wench, Barbossa yells: \\"Strike yer colors, ye bloomin cockroachers... They need a bit of persuasion mateys... Fire at will! Pound 'em lads! Pound 'em!\\" When a cannon is shot, guests may feel a powerful blast of air coming from the cannon, followed by a large splash and underwater lighting effects to simulate cannon fire. The village of Puerto Dorado on Isla Tesoro is overrun with pirates in search of treasure. The first sight is the town square, where some pirates have kidnapped the mayor, Carlos, and threaten to drown him in a well if he doesn't divulge the location of the treasure. Carlos' wife tells him to be brave and not talk; she is shot at as Carlos is repeatedly dunked in the water while several other captive city officials look on. Captain Jack Sparrow is seen hiding behind some dresses. An auction scene follows, where a pirate auctions off loot from the townspeople to other pirates. A redheaded female pirate is more interested in the town's rum supply, as are the bidders, who ignore the chickens that are currently offered for bidding. In the next scene, pirates run around chasing women holding trays of food, and two foolish buccaneers who have stolen snacks are chased by an angry woman holding a rolling pin. Just beyond is the \\"Pooped Pirate\\" drunkenly waving a map and key to a treasure vault, boasting that Captain Jack Sparrow will never see it. Jack is hiding in a barrel just behind him, popping out and getting a good look at the map over the pirate's shoulder. Off to the side, a pirate by the name of \\"Old Bill\\" wants to share rum with a group of terrified alley cats. Carefree, tipsy pirates succeed in ravaging the town and setting it aflame, filling the night air with an orange glow. Riders next float past a jail where imprisoned pirates are doing their best to escape as flames draw near. A small dog just out of the prisoners' reach holds the key to their escape in his teeth; he seems all but immune to the pleas of the pirates trying to coax him closer. One of the pirates holds a noose, hoping to trap the dog. Timbers are smoldering and cracking overhead as riders sail through a storage room filled with gunpowder, cannonballs, and rum-filled, gun-shooting pirates singing \\"Yo Ho, Yo Ho, A Pirate's Life For Me\\". A shootout between the inebriated crew and captain of the pirate ship in a flaming ammunition warehouse threatens to demolish the entire village. Finally, Jack Sparrow is seen in a room full of the hidden treasure (the treasure vault as mentioned by the Pooped Pirate). He is draped over a large throne-like chair and waves his new treasures around happily while chattering to himself and to passing guests. Every once in a while he sings, \\"Drink up, me hearties. Yo ho!\\". The boats proceed up a lift hill, and Davy Jones' and Blackbeard's voices are alternatively heard, encouraging riders to come back soon. The boats reach the top of the hill and spill back into the sleepy bayou where the journey began, passing by a parrot on a sandbar that can be seen from the queue. =Magic Kingdom= Magic Kingdom's Pirates of the Caribbean The ride, guarded by the Caribbean watchtower Torre del Sol, is housed in a golden Spanish fort called Castillo Del Morro, inspired by Castillo de San Felipe del Morro in the Old San Juan in Puerto Rico. \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" Disney Reporter ‚Äì Where the Magic Lives The queue winds through the fort, passing supplies and cannons, and a pair of pirate skeletons sit at a chessboard. The chess-playing skeletons gag was specifically designed for the Magic Kingdom by Imagineer Marc Davis, who was tasked with designing the ride. There are two queues designed to evoke a different atmosphere, one is the \\"Soldier\\" side (the left) and the other is the \\"Pirate\\" side (the right, which is now the Fastpass Plus queue). Both these queues converge with the loading area known as Pirate's Cove. Riders board their boats before entering a cavern that is similar to Dead Man's Cove in the Anaheim version. Guests pass through a mist waterfall with projections of Davy Jones and Blackbeard warning of the dangers ahead, before passing a pirate and mermaid skeleton on a beach. The same ship has run aground in a storm, with the pilot being nothing more than a skeleton. A talking skull takes a ride photo at this point, just before the boats slip into the darkness and down a waterfall. After this, the ride is almost identical to Anaheim. After passing the locked up pirates trying to coerce the keys from the dog, riders pass by Captain Jack Sparrow sitting in a room full of treasure, singing to himself cheerfully. Guests then exit their boat, and board a speed ramp back to ground level, which drops guests in the gift shop. =Disneyland Paris= Disneyland Paris version The Pirates of the Caribbean ride at Disneyland Paris is housed in a battle-scarred fortress at the back of the park. The queuing area winds through several courtyards outside before entering the fortress show building. Inside, the queue passes through the dungeons of the fort, offering glimpses of several skeleton pirates, along with a view of the crew's quarters scene from a balcony looking down. The queue then enters the Blue Lagoon area inside the show building, made to feel as though guests are outside at nighttime. The transport system was manufactured by Intamin. After boarding boats from a dock at the base of the fort, riders are sent under an archway and out into the Blue Lagoon, passing by the dining area on the left side and a jungle setting on the right. The boats pass through a shipwreck and enter an old fortress nearby. Inside the fort, gun noises and swordplay are heard in the back as the boats climb up a large lift hill used to haul cargo throughout the building. At the top, riders are given a brief view of the Wicked Wench pirate ship in the harbor below before entering into the depths of the fort. Inside, flames engulf the fort, and the shadows of fighting pirates and soldiers are seen. Up ahead, riders see the pirates in jail trying to coax the key from a guard dog. The boats go down a waterfall in the side of the fort caused by a cannonball and pass the 'bombarding the fort' scene, which riders have just previously seen from above, where the soldiers and the pirates fire at guests. Entering the relative safety of the town, riders see all the original scenes from the Disneyland version, as well as a new pair of sword-fighting men who duel for a girl in the chase scene, and a projection effect of two pirates chasing a girl around in an upstairs window. The main dialogue of the scenes is in French, with the minor parts in English. The boats then enter the burning town scene, where the original English vocal tracks are present, singing the theme song. The boats pass under an archway and enter the arsenal. The supplies are ignited by the fire and explode. Lights flash as an on-ride photo is taken, and the boats go down another drop into darkness. They emerge into the grotto scenes, passing all the skeleton pirate vintages seen at Disneyland, and a new shipwreck scene. Guests also encounter Captain Hector Barbossa, who transforms into a ghastly undead zombie, as he does as a result of his curse in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl; and Captain Jack Sparrow, sat in a room full of treasure and singing to himself. This part of the ride can be seen from the railroad as it passes through the show building (similar to Splash Mountain at the other parks). The skull and crossbones from the original are seen over an archway, issuing a bilingual safety spiel. The boats return to the dock, and riders exit into a themed gift shop where they can purchase their on-ride-photo. =Shanghai Disneyland= Unlike other versions of the ride, Pirates of the Caribbean: Battle for the Sunken Treasure uses a storyline based on the eponymous film series. It blends digital large-screen projection technology with traditional set pieces and audio animatronics. Walt Disney Imagineering designed the ride and Industrial Light & Magic created the computer-generated visual effects. Modifications The Old Bill scene was originally designed in 1972 for the Magic Kingdom version, but the scene was eventually brought to Disneyland, shortly after the Magic Kingdom version opened in 1973. The Barker Bird that guarded the entrance of the Magic Kingdom's version was originally installed in the unloading area when the ride opened in 1973. However, the issues with crowd control and congestion in the unloading area led to its placement outside of the entrance in 1975 and the 2006 refurbishment relocated the Barker Bird to the World of Disney Store until 2012. The loading area of the ride at Walt Disney World originally had a dual loading system with two channels to double the loading capacity. However, safety concerns over the underwater fin that would dispatch the boats resulted in the decision to use a single channel for both loading docks during a refurbishment made in the fall of 1991. As of 2017, both channels exist, but only one is used. In 1997, the chase scene of the Disneyland original and Magic Kingdom version, which depicted male pirates chasing women (except for the final scene, where the roles were reversed), was altered, now showing the pirates chasing the women in pursuit of food the women were carrying. The \\"Pooped Pirate\\" was recast as the \\"Gluttonous Pirate,\\" a rogue in search of food, while the woman hiding in the barrel was replaced by a cat.http://nightflight.com/a-galleon-with-a-load-of-treasure-revisiting- disneylands-pirates-of-the-caribbean-48-years-old-today/ In Jason Surrell's book Pirates of the Caribbean: From The Magic Kingdom to the Movies, showwriter Francis Xavier \\"X\\" Atencio referred to these \\"softening\\" touches as \\"Boy Scouts of the Caribbean\\". In 2006, the ride was refurbished again, in order to tie it in with the then-new Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl film. This refurbishment saw the addition of Jack Sparrow animatronics to three individual scenes, as well as Captain Barbossa replacing the pirate captain in the battle room and an added waterfall projection of Davy Jones' face in the cave. The \\"Pooped/Gluttonous Pirate\\" now held a treasure map in his lap and a magnifying glass in one hand, and other modifications were made to the ride's lighting, audio, dialogue and effects.https://disneydose.com/pirates-of-the-caribbean-history/ Blackbeard projection at the Magic Kingdom ride, which is no longer present. To coincide with the release of the 2011 film Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, a projection of Captain Blackbeard from the film (portrayed by original actor Ian McShane) temporarily replaced the 2006 waterfall mist projection of Davy Jones in both the Disneyland and Magic Kingdom versions of the ride, beginning on May 20, 2011.. In late 2012, projections of mermaids swimming alongside the boats and a mermaid skeleton were added to the ride at Disney World. . The mermaid projection effect was removed during a referb in 2015, as it reportedly didn't live up to the designer's expectations. On April 26, 2017, the Disneyland ride closed during the afternoon in order to temporarily remove the first Jack Sparrow animatronic hiding behind the dresses, with actor Johnny Depp taking its place, interacting with guests as they passed by. This was part of a promotion for Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. In June 2017, Disney announced that animatronics of Jack Sparrow would be added to two scenes in the Disneyland Paris version. It was also at this time that Disney reincorporated the talking skull at the Magic Kingdom version. Later that month, Disney announced a change to the auction scene at Disneyland Paris, Disneyland California, and Magic Kingdom, in which the town's women, including the scarlet-clothed redheaded damsel, are auctioned off to the pirates. Instead, the new scene depicts the redhead as a pirate helping the auctioneer sell off loot acquired from the townspeople. The Disneyland Paris version reopened on July 24, 2017 with the changes, while also incorporating the animatronic of Captain Barbossa and projected images of Davy Jones and Blackbeard. The Magic Kingdom version received the new auction scene in March 2018 and Disneyland's version received it in June 2018, after a scheduled refurbishment. The June 2018 refurbishment at Disneyland also included three changes to the tunnel scene following the treasure room: the mist waterfall (and Davy Jones/Blackbeard narration) was removed entirely, the original 1967 narration by Paul Frees was reinstated, and a scene was added at the end of the cave, depicting a skeleton transforming into a live pirate as the boat passes by.https://attractionsmagazine.com/disneylands-pirates-of-the- caribbean-reopens-with-new-scenes/  Adaptations  In 2003, Disney released Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, a feature film inspired by the ride starring Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow in an Oscar- nominated performance. It has been followed by four sequels: Dead Man's Chest (2006), At World's End (2007), On Stranger Tides (2011), and Dead Men Tell No Tales (2017), with the second installment winning an Oscar for Best Special Effects in 2007. The series has grossed over US$3.7 billion worldwide. These films included numerous allusions to the ride, most notably the attack on the fort, the famous jail scene, the namesake song, and a few lines from the characters. At Disneyland and the Magic Kingdom Park of Walt Disney World, the character of Captain Jack Sparrow is occasionally available for photos and autographs, and is further featured in the short show Captain Jack Sparrow's Pirate Tutorial based loosely on the film series. The show is presented in front of or adjacent to the respective park's Pirates of the Caribbean rides and features Captain Jack holding court and enlisting budding pirates to join his crew. Alongside Captain Jack is Mack, his faithful crewman; together they teach the audience how to be a pirate. A video game by Akella, loosely connected to the first movie's plot, was released to coincide with the film. Worlds based on the Pirates of the Caribbean films, appears in the Square Enix games Kingdom Hearts II and Kingdom Hearts III. In 2000, Pirates of the Caribbean II: Battle for Buccaneer Gold opened at DisneyQuest at Florida's Walt Disney World Resort. On this ride, up to five players board a virtual pirate ship to sail around a small 3-D world. Players may fire cannons at other virtual pirate ships; if opposing ships are sunk, their treasure will be \\"stolen\\". Video game developer Ron Gilbert has often said that the ambience for the Monkey Island video game series was partially inspired by the Disney ride. One obvious homage is the prison scene in Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge, in which the player needs to retrieve the cell key from a dog using a bone. Although the dog in the scene is named Walt, it is named after game artist Steve Purcell's dog and not after Walt Disney.

She plays soprano, tenor and baritone saxophone. Wood makes frequent appearances at Scandinavian jazz and blues festivals including Finland's Pori Jazz festival. Wood got her start in Milwaukee with the R&B; Cadets, and gained further exposure with Paul Cebar & the Milwaukeeans‚Äîwhich also featured vocalists Robyn Pluer, and Paul Cebar‚Äîwho toured between Milwaukee, Chicago, and Minneapolis. Wood plays baritone with organist Melvin Rhyne as a quintet on a self-published CD, Movin' and Groovin‚Ä≤. Her CD Blues for Earma Jean was released in November 2004 featuring Chicago pianist Earma Thompson. She plays with Milwaukee area jazz duo Mrs. Fun, and several of her contributions can be heard on The Best of Mrs. Fun (Daemon Records). Wood is a member of Valley of the Dolls, with Janet Planet, Connie Grauer and Kim Zick, who have released an album entitled High. Her 2015 recording Synkk√§ Mets√§ (Dark Forest) draws on material from her Finnish heritage.Dan McClenaghan, \\"Juli Wood Quartet: Synkka Metsa (Dark Forest)\\", AllAboutJazz, August 6, 2015. On one of her near-yearly trips to Finland she was listening to jazz trumpeter Art Farmer's recording of Swedish folk songs, To Sweden with Love (1964), and decided to record \\"simple and hauntingly beautiful Finnish folk songs, instrumentally and in a jazz style.\\" She was named the Finlandia Foundation Performer of the Year for 2018. The foundation awarded her two grants: the first to research and produce a follow up to Synkk√§ Mets√§; the other for traveling the USA performing the Finnish folk songs in jazz styles. She has \\"played many jazz clubs and festivals nationally and internationally; Chicago Jazz Fest, Hyde Park Jazz Fest, Milwaukee's Summerfest, Chicago's main jazz clubs - The Jazz Showcase, Green Mill Cocktail Lounge, Andy's and Katerina's. Skansen Jazz and Blues (Stockholm, Sweden), Pori Jazz Fest (Finland), Bent J's club (Aarhus, Denmark), Storyville (Helsinki, Finland), Arlandia Jazz Fest (√Öland Islands, Finland) to name a few\\". In 2018 she debuted Big Bari Band, with both her and fellow saxophonist Rajiv Halim On baritone saxophones.  Biography  Juli Wood's four grandparents immigrated from the Ostrobothnia region in Finland in the early 1900s to Minnesota‚Äôs Iron Range, and Duluth. She grew up in the Milwaukee, Wisconsin area, her parents instilling Finnish heritage. She became enamored by the saxophone while in grade school, \\"I remember watching Soul Train as a kid on T.V. in the 70‚Äôs and seeing Maceo Parker playing alto sax with James Brown. I thought that was the coolest looking and sounding instrument in the world! So the love affair with the saxophone started in the sixth grade and has been going strong ever since.\\" In high school she played in the schools concert orchestra, and marching, and jazz bands. After graduating high school in 1977, she visited Finland, and made return visits nearly every summer. She briefly attended University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee (UWM) but dropped out to focus on the city's music scene. She soon joined the R&B; Cadets, with singer Robyn Pluer, and John and Mike Sieger who later broke off to form Semi-Twang; a later version of the Cadets would include Paul Cebar who had a knack for unearthing obscure jazz songs that made for great cover songs. In 1983 she returned to UWM majoring in classical saxophone, she found training in the concert band, and jazz bands invaluable. Around this time until 1987 she gigged with jazz combos throughout Milwaukee. In 1987 she joined Paul Cebar & the Milwaukeeans reuniting with Cebar and Pluer playing danceable rhythm & blues. She had a side project with Pluer and a jazz duo Mrs. Fun called Rhythm Club; Wood was also teaching saxophone to up to forty students during the work week at several venues. The Milwaukeeans would rotate weekends between Chicago, their hometown, and Minneapolis/St. Paul Minnesota, commuting back after playing two or more clubs and events; Wood enjoyed the time but also found the live band was too loud to be sustained. From 1993, for a few years she turned back to jazz and worked to develop the Juli Wood Quartet. She trained in jazz at the Wisconsin Conservatory of Music, and has been mentored by jazz musicians she admires. In 1996 she moved to Chicago.

He pioneered the investigation of radio and microwave optics, made significant contributions to plant science, and laid the foundations of experimental science in the Indian subcontinent.Chatterjee, Santimay and Chatterjee, Enakshi, Satyendranath Bose, 2002 reprint, p. 5, National Book Trust, IEEE named him one of the fathers of radio science. Bose is considered the father of Bengali science fiction, and also invented the crescograph, a device for measuring the growth of plants. A crater on the moon has been named in his honour.Bose (crater) He founded Bose Institute, a premier research institute of India and also one of its oldest. Established in 1917, the Institute was the first interdisciplinary research centre in Asia. He served as the Director of Bose Institute from its inception until his death. Born in Munshiganj, Bengal Presidency, during British governance of India (now in Bangladesh), Bose graduated from St. Xavier's College, Calcutta (now Kolkata , West Bengal , India). He went to the University of London, England to study medicine, but could not pursue studies in medicine because of health problems. Instead, he conducted his research with the Nobel Laureate Lord Rayleigh at Cambridge and returned to India. He joined the Presidency College of the University of Calcutta as a professor of physics. There, despite racial discrimination and a lack of funding and equipment, Bose carried on his scientific research. He made remarkable progress in his research of remote wireless signalling and was the first to use semiconductor junctions to detect radio signals. However, instead of trying to gain commercial benefit from this invention, Bose made his inventions public in order to allow others to further develop his research. Bose subsequently made a number of pioneering discoveries in plant physiology. He used his own invention, the crescograph, to measure plant response to various stimuli, and thereby scientifically proved parallelism between animal and plant tissues. Although Bose filed for a patent for one of his inventions because of peer pressure, his objection to any form of patenting was well known. To facilitate his research, he constructed automatic recorders capable of registering extremely slight movements; these instruments produced some striking results, such as quivering of injured plants, which Bose interpreted as a power of feeling in plants. His books include Response in the Living and Non-Living (1902) and The Nervous Mechanism of Plants (1926). In a 2004 BBC poll, Bose was voted seventh Greatest Bengali of all time..  Early life and education  Jagadish Chandra Bose in Royal Institution, London, 1897 Jagadish Chandra Bose was born in a Bengali Kayastha family in Munsiganj (Bikrampur), Bengal Presidency (present-day Bangladesh) on 30 November 1858. His father, Bhagawan Chandra Bose, was a leading member of the Brahmo Samaj and worked as a deputy magistrate and assistant commissioner in Faridpur, Bardhaman and other places.Mukherji, pp. 3‚Äì10. Bose's education started in a vernacular school, because his father believed that one must know one's own mother tongue before beginning English, and that one should know also one's own people. Speaking at the Bikrampur Conference in 1915, Bose said: Bose joined the Hare School in 1869 and then St. Xavier's School at Kolkata. In 1875, he passed the Entrance Examination (equivalent to school graduation) of the University of Calcutta and was admitted to St. Xavier's College, Calcutta. At St. Xavier's, Bose came in contact with Jesuit Father Eugene Lafont, who played a significant role in developing his interest in natural sciences. He received a BA from the University of Calcutta in 1879. Bose wanted to go to England to compete for the Indian Civil Service. However, his father, a civil servant himself, cancelled the plan. He wished his son to be a scholar, who would ‚Äúrule nobody but himself.‚Äù Bose went to England to study Medicine at the University of London. However, he had to quit because of ill health. The odour in the dissection rooms is also said to have exacerbated his illness. Through the recommendation of Anandamohan Bose, his brother-in-law (sister's husband) and the first Indian Wrangler, he secured admission in Christ's College, Cambridge to study natural sciences. He received a BA (Natural Sciences Tripos) from the University of Cambridge and a BSc from the University College London affiliated under University of London in 1884, and a DSc from the University College London, University of London in 1896. Among Bose's teachers at Cambridge were Lord Rayleigh, Michael Foster, James Dewar, Francis Darwin, Francis Balfour, and Sidney Vines. At the time when Bose was a student at Cambridge, Prafulla Chandra Roy was a student at Edinburgh. They met in London and became intimate friends. Later he was married to Abala Bose, the renowned feminist and social worker.Sengupta, Subodh Chandra and Bose, Anjali (editors), 1976/1998, Sansad Bangali Charitabhidhan (Biographical dictionary) Vol I, , p23, One of the important influences on Bose was Sister Nivedita who supported him by organizing financial support and editing his manuscripts; she made sure that Bose was able to continue with and share his work.  Radio research  Bose's 60 GHz microwave apparatus at the Bose Institute, Kolkata, India. His receiver (left) used a galena crystal detector inside a horn antenna and galvanometer to detect microwaves. Bose invented the crystal radio detector, waveguide, horn antenna, and other apparatus used at microwave frequencies. The Scottish theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell mathematically predicted the existence of electromagnetic radiation of diverse wavelengths, but he died in 1879 before his prediction was experimentally verified. Between 1886 and 1888, German physicist Heinrich Hertz published the results of his experiments on electromagnetism, which showed the existence of electromagnetic waves in free space. Subsequently, British physicist Oliver Lodge, who had also been researching electromagnetism, conducted a commemorative lecture in August 1894 (after Hertz's death) on the quasi- optical nature of \\"Hertzian waves\\" (radio waves) and demonstrated their similarity to light and vision including reflection and transmission at distances up to 50 metres. Lodge's work was published in book form and caught the attention of scientists in different countries, including Bose in India.Mukherji, pp. 14‚Äì25 The first remarkable aspect of Bose's follow-up microwave research was that he reduced the waves to the millimetre level (about 5 mm wavelength). He realised the disadvantages of long waves for studying their light-like properties. During a November 1894 (or 1895) public demonstration at Town Hall of Kolkata, Bose ignited gunpowder and rang a bell at a distance using millimetre range wavelength microwaves. Lieutenant Governor Sir William Mackenzie witnessed Bose's demonstration in the Kolkata Town Hall. Bose wrote in a Bengali essay, Adrisya Alok (Invisible Light), \\"The invisible light can easily pass through brick walls, buildings etc. Therefore, messages can be transmitted by means of it without the mediation of wires.\\" Bose's first scientific paper, \\"On polarisation of electric rays by double- refracting crystals\\" was communicated to the Asiatic Society of Bengal in May 1895, within a year of Lodge's paper. His second paper was communicated to the Royal Society of London by Lord Rayleigh in October 1895. In December 1895, the London journal Electrician (Vol. 36) published Bose's paper, \\"On a new electro-polariscope\\". At that time, the word coherer, coined by Lodge, was used in the English-speaking world for Hertzian wave receivers or detectors. The Electrician readily commented on Bose's coherer. (December 1895). The Englishman (18 January 1896) quoted from the Electrician and commented as follows: Bose planned to \\"perfect his coherer\\" but never thought of patenting it. Diagram of microwave receiver and transmitter apparatus, from Bose's 1897 paper. Bose went to London on a lecture tour in 1896 and met Italian inventor Guglielmo Marconi, who had been developing a radio wave wireless telegraphy system for over a year and was trying to market it to the British post service. In an interview, Bose expressed his disinterest in commercial telegraphy and suggested others use his research work. In 1899, Bose announced the development of a \\"iron-mercury-iron coherer with telephone detector\\" in a paper presented at the Royal Society, London. =Place in radio development= Bose's work in radio microwave optics was specifically directed towards studying the nature of the phenomenon and was not an attempt to develop radio into a communication medium.Sungook Hong, Wireless: From Marconi's Black-box to the Audion, MIT Press ‚Äì 2001, page 199 His experiments took place during this same period (from late 1894 on) when Guglielmo Marconi was making breakthroughs on a radio system specifically designed for wireless telegraphySungook Hong, Wireless: From Marconi's Black-box to the Audion, MIT Press ‚Äì 2001, page 21 and others were finding practical applications for radio waves, such as Russian physicist Alexander Stepanovich Popov radio wave based lightning detector, also inspired by Lodge's experiment. Although Bose's work was not related to communication he, like Lodge and other laboratory experimenters, probably had an influence on other inventors trying to develop radio as communications medium. reprinted in Igor Grigorov, Ed., Antentop, Vol. 2, No.3, pp. 87‚Äì96.Sungook Hong, Wireless: From Marconi's Black-box to the Audion, MIT Press ‚Äì 2001, page 22Jagadish Chandra Bose: The Real Inventor of Marconi‚Äôs Wireless Receiver; Varun Aggarwal, NSIT, Delhi, India Bose was not interested in patenting his work and openly revealed the operation of his galena crystal detector in his lectures. A friend in the US persuaded him to take out a US patent on his detector but he did not actively pursue it and allowed it to lapse.\\" Bose was the first to use a semiconductor junction to detect radio waves, and he invented various now-commonplace microwave components. In 1954, Pearson and Brattain gave priority to Bose for the use of a semi-conducting crystal as a detector of radio waves. In fact, further work at millimetre wavelengths was almost non-existent for the following 50 years. In 1897, Bose described to the Royal Institution in London his research carried out in Kolkata at millimetre wavelengths. He used waveguides, horn antennas, dielectric lenses, various polarisers and even semiconductors at frequencies as high as 60 GHz;. Much of his original equipment is still in existence, especially at the Bose Institute in Kolkata. A 1.3 mm multi-beam receiver now in use on the NRAO 12 Metre Telescope, Arizona, US, incorporates concepts from his original 1897 papers. Sir Nevill Mott, Nobel Laureate in 1977 for his own contributions to solid-state electronics, remarked that \\"J.C. Bose was at least 60 years ahead of his time. In fact, he had anticipated the existence of P-type and N-type semiconductors.\\"  Plant research  Jagadish Chandra Bose with other prominent scientists from Calcutta University. Bose conducted most of his studies in plant research on Mimosa pudica and Desmodium gyrans plants. His major contribution in the field of biophysics was the demonstration of the electrical nature of the conduction of various stimuli (e.g., wounds, chemical agents) in plants, which were earlier thought to be of a chemical nature. In order to understand the heliotropic movements of plants (the movement of a plant towards a light source), Bose invented a torsional recorder. He found that light applied to one side of the sunflower caused turbot to increase on the opposite side. These claims were later proven experimentally. He was also the first to study the action of microwaves in plant tissues and corresponding changes in the cell membrane potential. He researched the mechanism of the seasonal effect on plants, the effect of chemical inhibitors on plant stimuli and the effect of temperature.  Study of metal fatigue and cell response  Bose performed a comparative study of the fatigue response of various metals and organic tissue in plants. He subjected metals to a combination of mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electrical stimuli and noted the similarities between metals and cells. Bose's experiments demonstrated a cyclical fatigue response in both stimulated cells and metals, as well as a distinctive cyclical fatigue and recovery response across multiple types of stimuli in both living cells and metals. Bose documented a characteristic electrical response curve of plant cells to electrical stimulus, as well as the decrease and eventual absence of this response in plants treated with anaesthetics or poison. The response was also absent in zinc treated with oxalic acid. He noted a similarity in reduction of elasticity between cooled metal wires and organic cells, as well as an impact on the recovery cycle period of the metal.Response in the Living and Non- Living by Sir Jagadis Chandra Bose ‚Äì Project Gutenberg. Gutenberg.org (3 August 2006). Retrieved 7 July 2012.  Science fiction  In 1896, Bose wrote Niruddesher Kahini (The Story of the Missing One), a short story that was later expanded and added to Abyakta (‡¶Ö‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§) collection in 1921 with the new title Palatak Tuphan (Runaway Cyclone). It was one of the first works of Bengali science fiction. It has been translated into English by Bodhisattva Chattopadhyay. Bose Institute  In 1917 Bose established the Bose Institute in Kolkata, West Bengal, India. Bose was its Director for the first twenty years till his demise. Today it is a public research institute of India and also one of its oldest. Bose in his inaugural address on November 30, 1917 dedicated the Institute to the nation saying:  Legacy and honors  Acharya Bhavan, the residence of J C Bose built in 1902, was turned into a museum.Acharya Bhavan Opens Its Doors to Visitors. The Times of India. 3 July 2011. Bose's place in history has now been re-evaluated. His work may have contributed to the development of radio communication. He is also credited with discovering millimetre length electromagnetic waves and being a pioneer in the field of biophysics. Many of his instruments are still on display and remain largely usable now, over 100 years later. They include various antennas, polarisers, and waveguides, which remain in use in modern forms today. To commemorate his birth centenary in 1958, the JBNSTS scholarship programme was started in West Bengal. In the same year, India issued a postage stamp bearing his portrait. On 14 September 2012, Bose's experimental work in millimetre-band radio was recognised as an IEEE Milestone in Electrical and Computer Engineering, the first such recognition of a discovery in India. On 30 November 2016, Bose was celebrated in a Google Doodle on the 158th anniversary of his birth. The Bank of England has decided to redesign the 50 UK Pound currency note with an eminent scientist.

The city is also the municipal seat of the surrounding municipality of the same name. The municipality's area is and its population at the census was 49,454 inhabitants. It includes Scorpion Reef with its five islets 130 km offshore (north) on the outer edge of Campeche Bank. Its largest other towns are Chicxulub, Campestre Flamboyanes, and Chelem. Progreso is a center for both the fishing industry and the container industry. All containers arrive in Progreso and are distributed to Yucat√°n, Campeche and Quintana Roo. Progreso also is one of the newest ports for large cruise ships and an emerging balneario resort destination. Passengers disembark on a very long pier, the Terminal Remota opened in 1989 that juts out into the Gulf of Mexico. Passengers are taken to shore to visit Progreso, M√©rida or the Maya civilization archaeological sites of Uxmal and Dzibilchaltun. During the months of July and August the beaches fill with thousands of mostly local tourists, as it is traditional in these months for residents of M√©rida to leave the city and spend the summer in the cooler seaside environment. History Progreso was founded in 1872, to create a sea port closer to M√©rida than the older port of Sisal, Yucat√°n. Climate Despite its coastal location and fairly humid climate (average humidity around 70‚Äì80%), Progreso has a semi-arid climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BSh). There is little variation in average temperatures though the winter months from December to March are noticeably more cool. Precipitation is scarce throughout the year but is more abundant from June to October. On average, there are 36 days with measureable rainfall.

Louvois and his father, Michel le Tellier, would increase the French Army to 400,000 soldiers, an army that would fight four wars between 1667 and 1713. He is commonly referred to as \\"Louvois\\". Early life Louvois was born in Paris on 18 January 1641, to Michel Le Tellier, and √âlisabeth Turpin. Louvois received instructions from his father in the management of state affairs. The young man won the king's confidence, and in 1666 he succeeded his father as war minister. His talents were perceived by Turenne in the War of Devolution (1667‚Äì68), who gave him instruction in the art of providing armies. After the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, Louvois devoted himself to organising the French army. The years between 1668 and 1672, says Camille Rousset, \\"were years of preparation, when Lionne was labouring with all his might to find allies, Colbert to find money, and Louvois soldiers for Louis\\". The Man in the Iron Mask, whose name was given as Eustache Dauger, is first mentioned in a letter written by Louvois, dated 19 July 1669. Work Portrait engraved from life in 1677 by Robert Nanteuil The work of Louvois in these years is bound up with the historical development of the French army and of armies in general. Here need only be mentioned Louvois's reorganization of the military orders of merit, his foundation of the H√¥tel des Invalides, and the almost forcible enrollment of the nobility and gentry of France, in which Louvois carried out part of Louis's measures for curbing the spirit of independence by service in the army or at court. The success of his measures is to be seen in the victories of the Franco-Dutch War of 1672‚Äì78. After the Peace of Nijmegen Louvois was high in favour, his father had been made chancellor, and the influence of Colbert was waning. The ten years of peace between 1678 and 1688 were distinguished in French history by the rise of Madame de Maintenon, the capture of Strasbourg and the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, in all of which Louvois bore a prominent part. The surprise of Strasbourg in 1681 in time of peace was not only planned but executed by Louvois and Monclar. A saving clause in the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, which provided for some liberty of conscience, if not of worship, Louvois sharply annulled with the phrase \\"Sa majest√© veut qu'on fasse sentir les derni√®res rigueurs a ceux qui ne voudront pas se faire de sa religion\\" (\\"His Majesty wishes the worst harshness on those who do not partake of his religion\\"). He claimed also the credit of inventing the dragonnades, and mitigated the depredations of the soldiery only insofar as the licence accorded was prejudicial to discipline. Discipline, indeed, and complete subjection to the royal authority was the political faith of Louvois. Later life Colbert died in 1683, and had been replaced by Le Pelletier, an adherent of Louvois, in the controller-generalship of finances, and by Louvois himself in his ministry for public buildings, which he took that he might be the minister able to gratify the king's two favourite pastimes, war and building. Louvois was able to superintend the successes of the first years of the war of the League of Augsburg and in 1688 initiated the collection of Plans-Reliefs of French strongholds that is now the Mus√©e des Plans-Reliefs. However, he died suddenly of apoplexy after leaving the king's cabinet on 16 July 1691, but Voltaire claims in \\"Le Siecle de Louis XIV\\" that Louvois died while he was taking waters in Balaruc. His sudden death caused a suspicion of poison. Legacy Louvois was one of the greatest of the rare class of great war ministers. French history can only point to Carnot as his equal. Both had to organize armies out of old material on a new system, both were admirable contrivers of campaigns, and both devoted themselves to the material well- being of the soldiers. In private life and in the means employed for gaining his ends, Louvois was unscrupulous and shameless. Family Portrait of Anne de Souvree, 1670s Louvois, through a marriage arranged by his father, wed an heiress, Anne de Souvr√©, Marquise de Courtenvaux. He had six children with Anne: * Michael Fran√ßois, Marquis of Courtanvaux, who married the daughter of Jean II d'Estr√©es * Madeleine Charlotte (1665‚Äì1735), who married Fran√ßois de La Rochefoucauld VIII, Duc de La Roche-Guyon (1663‚Äì1728) * Louis-Nicolas, Marquis de Souvr√© * Louis Fran√ßois Marie, Marquis Barbezieux * Camille de Louvois * Margaret (died 1711), married Louis Nicolas de Neufville de Villeroy, Marquis of Alincourt See also * French government ministers * List of Finance Ministers of France * Fort Louvois Notes References * ;Attribution * Endnotes: ** The principal authority for Louvois's life and times is Camille Rousset's Histoire de Louvois (Paris, 1872), a great work founded on the 900 volumes of his despatches at the Dep√¥t de la Guerre. Saint Simon from his class prejudices is hardly to be trusted, but Madame de Sevigne throws many side-lights on his times. Testament politique de Louvois (1695) is spurious.

The groundbreaking ceremony occurred on February 19, 1937, with United States Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes attending. The dam was a joint project by the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) and the United States Bureau of Reclamation, with partial funding provided by the Public Works Administration. Brown and Root, headed by James E. Walters, Sr., was the prime contractor. The dam was completed in 1941. Originally called Marshall Ford Dam, the name was changed in 1941 in honor of United States Representative J.J. Mansfield. The reservoir behind Mansfield Dam is named Lake Travis. The dam is owned and operated by the LCRA. Mansfield Dam is high, long, and thick at the base. The concrete gravity dam with embankment wings and saddle dikes was designed to control flooding; to store 1.4 km¬≥ (369 billion US gallons) of water; and to generate hydroelectric power (108 megawatts). The Spillway Elevation is 714 feet above Mean Sea Level (MSL). LCRA begins to open floods gates when water reaches 681 feet above MSL. At 681 feet above MSL, discharge capacity exceeds 130,000 cfs as the lake rises. A two-lane highway, RM 620, crossed the top of the dam, but traffic congestion brought on by the growth of the city of Austin and expanded popularity of recreation at Lake Travis forced the state to build a four-lane highway bridge on the downstream side of the dam, and RM 620 was rerouted over that bridge. Traffic is no longer allowed on the road across the dam, except for service vehicles.

beach house parties, with sketches by Marguerite Martyn of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and photographs of society women, 1909. The man in the center is carrying golf clubs, and there is a hammock in the lower drawing. A hammock (from Spanish , borrowed from Ta√≠no and Arawak ) is a sling made of fabric, rope, or netting, suspended between two or more points, used for swinging, sleeping, or resting. It normally consists of one or more cloth panels, or a woven network of twine or thin rope stretched with ropes between two firm anchor points such as trees or posts. Hammocks were developed by native inhabitants of the Caribbean, Central America, and South America for sleeping, as well as the English. Later, they were used aboard ships by sailors to enable comfort and maximize available space, and by explorers or soldiers travelling in wooded regions. Eventually, in the 1920s, parents throughout North America used fabric hammocks to contain babies just learning to crawl. Today they are popular around the world for relaxation; they are also used as a lightweight bed on camping trips. The hammock is often seen as a symbol of summer, leisure, relaxation and simple, easy living.  Etymology  The word hammock comes, via Spanish, from a Ta√≠no culture Arawakan word meaning \\"stretch of cloth\\" from the Arawak root . The Amerindian origin of the word was often obscured in English-language sources from the late 18th century onward. Samuel Johnson claimed that it was of Saxon origin,Samuel Johnson (1785) A Dictionary of the English Language but his etymology was soon debunked.Arthur Broughton (1797) The History, Civil and Commercial, of the British Colonies in the West Indies Hamaka was meaningfully transformed into modern German H√§ngematte, Swedish H√§ngmatta and Dutch Hangmat (all literally hanging mat).  History  = Europe = Hexateuch, 11th century) Hammock in the Luttrell Psalter (c. 1330) Some 19th-century authors attributed the invention of the hammock to the Athenian politician Alcibiades (d. 404 BC).Thomas Dudley Fosbroke (1825), Encyclop√¶dia of Antiquities, and Elements of Archaeology, Classical and Medieval, Vol. 1, London, p. 270 This was inferred from Plutarch, who wrote that Alcibiades had his galley bed hung from ropes, but did not specifically describe it as a net or sling.Plutarch, Life of Alcibiades, 16.1 Other ancient writers mention the use of hanging beds to improve sleep or health without giving details on their mode of suspension.Pliny the Elder, The Natural History, 26.8; Aulus Cornelius Celsus, De Medicina, 3.18 The 11th-century Old English Hexateuch shows the biblical Joseph, promoted to the \\"second chariot\\" of the pharaoh (that is second in command), in a simple type of vehicle, the body of which seems to be a cloth hammock. The piece is suspended on two hooks attached to two opposite posts rising from the chassis. The hammock motif is repeated in the manuscript in a series of increasingly abstract miniatures, leaving it open to interpretation whether the artist had in mind a wheeled hammock litter or a rudimentary coach with a flexible suspension. leans towards the identification as a proper hammock, argues for the latter. The hammock reappears in unequivocal form in another medieval English source, the Luttrell Psalter (dated to c. 1330), where it has developed to a regular hanging bed. The sling now ends in two rope beckets that anticipate the rings of the naval hammock. Like the earliest known naval specimen the fabric is canvas, not the netting the Spanish later encounter in the New World. The Dutch historian of technology Andr√© Sleeswyk argues that it may have been this English type that eventually spread through the European navies despite the word hammock later being adopted from the Americas: = New World = America herself: engraving by Theodor Galle after Stradanus, ca 1630 Spanish colonists noted the use of the hammock by Native Americans, particularly in the West Indies, at the time of the Spanish conquest.Bartolom√© de las Casas (1542) The Destruction of the Indies Columbus, in the narrative of his first voyage, says: ‚ÄúA great many Indians in canoes came to the ship to-day for the purpose of bartering their cotton, and hamacas, or nets, in which they sleep.‚Äù He observed the widespread use of hammocks during his travels among the Taino people in the Bahamas. clipper ship days Early hammocks were woven out of tree bark, and later this material was replaced by sisal fibers because it was more abundant. One of the reasons that hammocks became popular in Central and South America was their ability to provide safety from disease transmission, insect stings, or animal bites. By suspending their beds above ground, inhabitants were better protected from snakes, biting ants, and other harmful creatures.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (1823) The Dream, 1844, Gustave Courbet (1819‚Äì1877) school ship crew in their hammocks, 1951. = Naval hammocks = Around 1590, hammocks were adopted for use in sailing ships; the Royal Navy formally adopted the sling hammock in 1597 when it ordered three hundred bolts of canvas for \\"hanging cabbons or beddes\\". Aboard ship, hammocks were regularly employed for sailors sleeping on the gun decks of warships, where limited space prevented the installation of permanent bunks. Since a slung hammock moves in concert with the motion of the vessel, the occupant is not at a risk of being thrown onto the deck (which may be 5 or 6 feet below) during swells or rough seas. Likewise, a hammock provides more comfortable sleep than a bunk or a berth while at sea since the sleeper always stays well balanced, irrespective of the motion of the vessel. Prior to the adoption of naval hammocks, sailors would often be injured or even killed as they fell off their berths or rolled on the decks on heavy seas. The sides of traditional canvas naval hammocks wrap around the sleeper like a cocoon, making an inadvertent fall virtually impossible. If suitably packed, they could also be used as emergency flotation devices. Many sailors in the Royal Navy, during the 1950s at least, used a spreader ‚Äì a length of wood with a V cut in each end to engage the second hammock string on each side. The first string was set up more tightly than the others so that it raised a protective lip along each side to keep out drafts and prevent the sleeper being thrown out. A narrow mattress was also issued which protected the user from cold from below. In addition naval hammocks could be rolled tightly and stowed in an out of the way place or in nets along the gunwale as additional protection during battle (as was the case during the age of sail). Many sailors became so accustomed to this way of sleeping that they brought their hammocks ashore with them on leave. The naval use of hammocks continued into the 20th century. During World War II, troopships sometimes employed hammocks for both naval ratings and soldiers in order to increase available space and troop carrying capacity. Many leisure sailors even today prefer hammocks over bunks because of better comfort in sleep while on the high seas. Hammocks have also been employed on spacecraft in order to utilize available space when not sleeping or resting. During the Apollo program, from Apollo 12 onwards, the Lunar Module was equipped with hammocks for the commander and lunar module pilot to sleep in between moonwalks. = Mexican and Mayan hammocks = Hand weaving, Yucat√°n, Mexico In Mexico, hammocks are made in villages surrounding the capital city of the Yucat√°n, M√©rida, and are sold throughout the world as well as locally. They were not part of Classic era Maya civilization; they were said to have arrived in the Yucat√°n from the Caribbean fewer than two centuries before the Spanish conquest. In addition to bark and sisal, hammocks were constructed from various materials, including palm fronds. Quality of native and modern hammocks depends greatly on the quality of the material, thread, and the number of threads used. Mayan hammocks are made on a loom and are hand woven by men, women and children. Hammocks are so symbolically and culturally important for the Yucatecans that even the most humble of homes have hammock hooks in the walls. = El Salvador hammocks = Three Salvadoran synthetic-thread hammocks (hamacas) strung inside a living room in Moraz√°n Department, El Salvador. El Salvador is a large producer and exporter of hammocks . The valley in which San Salvador City sits is dubbed \\"The Valley of the Hammocks\\" because the Native Americans used hammocks to \\"repel\\" constant earthquakes. Later, the colonizing Spaniards used the term as an allusion to earthquakes constantly rocking the valley like a hammock. Hammocks are a big part of Salvadoran culture and are often used for afternoon naps. It is completely socially acceptable to lie in a hammock all day in this Central American country. Hammocks swing from doorways, inside living rooms, on porches, in outdoor courtyards, and from trees, in all social classes of Salvadoran homes from the most humble rural home to the most prestigious city hotel chains. In rural El Salvador, a family home may have multiple hammocks strung across the main room, for use as seating, as beds, or as sleep-swings for infants. The municipality of \\"Concepcion Quezaltepeque\\" celebrates its traditional Hammocks Festival, where artisans produce and sell hammocks, every year between the first and second weekend of November. = Venezuelan hammock = In Venezuela entire villages raised their families in hammocks. During the first part of the 20th century, many scientists, adventurers, geologists and other non-native visitors to Central and South American jungles soon adopted the Venezuelan hammock design, which gave protection against scorpions and venomous snakes such as the fer de lance. The difficult jungle environments of South America encountered by Western explorers soon stimulated further development of the Venezuelan hammock for use in other tropical environments. The Venezuelan hammock's panels were always made of breathable material, necessary to prevent the onset of fungal infections caused by constant rain and high humidity.Kearny, Cresson H. (Major), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 240‚Äì248 Fine-woven sandfly netting was eventually added to provide more complete protection from mosquitoes, flies, and crawling insects, especially in regions notorious for malaria or screwworm infestations. A waterproof top sheet or rainfly could be added to protect the occupant from drenching by heavy nighttime rains, along with drip strings ‚Äì short pieces of string tied to suspension lines ‚Äî to prevent rainwater running from the tree trunk down the hammock cords to the hammock itself. A breathable false cotton (later nylon) bottom panel was frequently added to these jungle hammocks, allowing air to pass through while still preventing mosquito stings to the occupant. =Jungle Hammock= The Venezuelan hammock, as modified, eventually became known as a jungle hammock. Simply by wetting the hammock suspension ropes with insecticides or insect repellent, the jungle hammock even gave protection against crawling insects with mandibles that could bite holes through the insect netting. The United States Army eventually adopted their own version of the jungle hammock, complete with rain proof fly and sandfly netting for use by U.S. and Allied forces in tropical jungle regions such as Burma during World War II. While at first reluctant to accept the idea of its men sleeping in hammocks, the United States Marine Corps later employed jungle hammocks in New BritainLeckie, Robert, Helmet For My Pillow, Bantam (1979), pp. 230, 237‚Äì238 and later Pacific island campaigns where heavy rain and insects were prevalent; concerns over injuries from machine gun and artillery fire were overcome by first digging a slit trench, then staking the hammock's support lines to suspend the hammock beneath ground level.Kearny, Cresson H. (Major), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 244‚Äì254, 261 Later U.S. Army hammocks issued during the Vietnam War, such as the M1966 Jungle Hammock, were mistakenly fitted with waterproof bottom panels, which often became filled with water overnight.Kearny, Cresson H. (Major), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 256‚Äì257 On the other side, North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and Viet Cong (VC) forces regularly employed jungle hammocks fabricated from scavenged or captured US parachute cloth and shroud lines. Hung well off jungle trails, the hammocks kept down the incidence of disease and illness, which NVA commanders generally regarded as a greater threat than shrapnel injuries caused by sleeping above ground.Kearny, Cresson H. (Major), Jungle Snafus...And Remedies, Oregon Institute (1996), pp. 252‚Äì253 =Indian hammock= Baby Sari-hammock in Tamil Nadu, India Ceiling mounted hammocks for babies are traditional to south India. The textile used is the woven 5 meter Sari, which is long enough to be hung high, yet reach low enough to be safe for toddlers. The light material allows perspiration and cooling in the hot climate native to this region.  Current  = Usage = There are currently a wide variety of hammocks available. There are hammocks that are designed specifically for backpacking and include mosquito netting along with pockets for nighttime storage. There are hammocks made out of thin and lightweight material which makes them ideal for taking on daytrips. Other hammocks include self-standing metal or wood structures that support the hammock. Given that hammocks are commonly similar lengths to accommodate for an average adult's height, most hammock stands are universal in design, typically featuring a spreader bar that runs along the ground, feet for stability at each end, and a diagonal arm at each end to provide two hanging points. Although they are usually bought premade, it is also possible to make your own hammock. =Current hammocks= File:Bridge_Hammock.jpgBridge hammock with bugnet File:HammockinYard.jpgHammock on a frame in a residential backyard File:Otavalo Artisan Market - Andes Mountains - South America - photograph 064.JPGTraditional hammocks, Otavalo Artisan Market, Andes Mountains, Ecuador.

File:Snowy hammock in √âtalle (DSCF6709).jpgHammock with tarp and underquilt File:Hammocks brazil.jpgHammocks, Amazon River island, Brazil. Hammocks are very popular in the Brazilian northeast region, but not only as sleeping devices: in the poorest areas of the sert√£o, if there is not a cemetery in a settlement, hammocks may be used to carry the dead to a locale where there is one; also, they frequently serve as a low-cost alternative to coffins. This custom inspired Candido Portinari's 1944 painting Enterro na Rede (\\"burial in the hammock\\"). Traditionally the sailors who have died at sea were buried at sea in their hammocks. Medical research suggests the gentle rocking motion of the hammock allows users to fall asleep faster and sleep more deeply compared to a traditional, stationary mattress. = Styles = Current popular hammock styles include the spreader-bar, Mayan, Brazilian, naval, Nicaraguan, Venezuelan (jungle), and travel hammocks. Each style is distinctive and has its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Many hammocks come in a variety of colors, patterns, and sizes ranging from a one-person (250 ‚Äì 350 lbs / 110 ‚Äì 160 kg) to two or three person (400 lbs ‚Äì 600 lbs / 180 ‚Äì 270 kg). Common dimensions for unslung hammocks fall in a range between 3'/0.9m to 14'/4.2m across and 6'/1.8m to 11'/3.3m long. The spreader-bar hammock is easily recognized by wooden or metal bars at the head and foot of the hammock, spreading its width and allowing for easy access for casual use, such as in a backyard. Unfortunately, the spreader bars also make the hammock unsteady since the metacenter of the hammock when sleeping is very high. This style is generally considered less stable and less comfortable for sleeping than other styles. A subset of this style is the single-spreader bar hammock, which uses a spreader bar on only one end and is much more stable. A variation of the single-spreader bar hammock has three attachment points, one at each corner of the spreader bar and one at the non-spreader bar end and is nearly untippable. While the various styles of hammocks available today are similar in form, they differ significantly in materials, purpose, and construction. Mayan and Nicaraguan hammocks are made from either cotton or nylon string that are woven to form a supportive net. Mayan Hammocks have a looser weave than Nicaraguan hammocks, and the supportiveness of the hammock \\"bed\\" depends on the number of strings and quality of the weave. Brazilian hammocks are made from cotton fabric and usually more durable than the string varieties. While Mayan and Nicaraguan hammocks are considered by some to have the potential to be more comfortable, the Brazilian hammock's comfort is less dependent on its construction and therefore less likely to vary as highly from manufacturer to manufacturer. Naval hammocks are usually made from canvas or strong cotton. They are intended to be durable and stand well the hardships of shipboard use. They usually are simple and undecorated but robust. Venezuelan or jungle hammocks made today are generally of breathable nylon or polyester, and use dacron or similar non-stretch suspension lines. They are \\"inline\\" hammocks; like the canvas naval hammocks of old, the occupant sleeps along the length of the hammock, rather than across it. With their breathable false bottoms, drip strings, sandfly netting, and optional rainfly, they are one of the most secure hammocks against not only water entry, but also insect stings or bites. Relaxing on a yacht in a nylon hammock. This shows a use with a diagonal positioning of the body. Travel or camping hammocks are popular among leave no trace and ultra light campers, hikers, and sailing enthusiasts for their reduced impact on the environment and their lightness and lack of bulk compared to tents. They are typically made of sturdy nylon parachute fabric which may use ripstop techniques to improve durability. Some hammocks feature a mosquito net and storage pockets. Some types offer a ridgeline to make set up easier, and may also include a slit for entry through the bottom of the hammock. Special webbing straps (called \\"treehuggers\\") are used to loop around trees in order to create attachment points for the hammock. = Set-up and use = For non spreader-bar styles, the way in which they are hung is critical for comfort. Generally, a higher attachment point is preferred as well as sufficient length between points, though these two dimensions can be adjusted to compensate for a lack in one or the other. The optimal angle of the attaching lines to the post / wall / tree is usually about 30 degrees.Derek Hansen: The ultimate hang, page 14, Hammocks can be attached to the anchor points using a variety of suspension systems, including ropes and webbing straps.Derek Hansen: The ultimate hang, page 291, Though one can lie in a hammock lengthwise or across its width, most hammocks are best used with a diagonal position, as it provides the most room and support. Users with back and joint pains often report some relief from these problems when sleeping in a hammock in this manner.

It was first published by Jonathan Cape in the United Kingdom on 26 March 1964 and sold out quickly. It was the last Fleming novel published in his lifetime. It is the concluding chapter in what is known as the \\"Blofeld Trilogy\\" after Thunderball and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. The story starts eight months after the murder of Tracy Bond, which occurred at the end of the previous novel, On Her Majesty's Secret Service. James Bond is drinking and gambling heavily and making mistakes on his assignments when, as a last resort, he is sent to Japan on a semi-diplomatic mission. Whilst there he is challenged by the head of the Japanese Secret Service to kill Dr. Guntram Shatterhand. Bond realises that Shatterhand is Ernst Stavro Blofeld and sets out on a revenge mission to kill him and his wife, Irma Bunt. The novel deals on a personal level with the change in Bond from a depressed man in mourning, to a man of action bent on revenge, to an amnesiac living as a Japanese fisherman. Through the mouths of his characters, Fleming also examines the decline of post-World WarII British power and influence, notably in relation to the United States. The book was popular with the public, with pre-orders in the UK totalling 62,000; critics were more muted in their reactions, generally delivering mixed reviews of the novel. The story was serialised in the Daily Express newspaper and Playboy magazine, and also adapted for comic strip format in the Daily Express. The fifth entry in the Eon Productions James Bond film series, released in 1967 starring Sean Connery as Bond, borrowed its name from this novel. The film‚Äôs plot had little in common with the novel however. The novel has also been adapted as a radio play and broadcast on the BBC. Plot After the wedding-day murder of his wife, Tracy (see On Her Majesty's Secret Service), Bond begins to let his life slide, drinking and gambling heavily, making mistakes and turning up late for work. His superior in the Secret Service, M, had been planning to dismiss Bond, but decides to give him a last-chance opportunity to redeem himself by assigning him to the diplomatic branch of the organisation. Bond is subsequently re-numbered 7777 and handed an \\"impossible\\" mission: convincing the head of Japan's secret intelligence service, Tiger Tanaka, to provide Britain with information from radio transmissions captured from the Soviet Union, codenamed Magic 44. In exchange, the Secret Service will allow the Japanese access to one of their own information sources. Blofeld's Samurai armour would have protected him from the poisonous plants. Bond is introduced to Tanaka‚Äîand to the Japanese lifestyle‚Äîby an Australian intelligence officer, Dikko Henderson. When Bond raises the purpose of his mission with Tanaka, it transpires that the Japanese have already penetrated the British information source and Bond has nothing left to bargain with. Instead, Tanaka asks Bond to kill Dr. Guntram Shatterhand, who operates a politically embarrassing \\"Garden of Death\\" in a rebuilt ancient castle on the island of Kyushu; people flock there to commit suicide. After examining photos of Shatterhand and his wife, Bond discovers that \\"Shatterhand\\" and his wife are Tracy's murderers, Ernst Stavro Blofeld and Irma Bunt. Bond gladly takes the mission, keeping his knowledge of Blofeld's identity a secret so that he can exact revenge for his wife's death. Made up and trained by Tanaka, and aided by former Japanese film star Kissy Suzuki, Bond attempts to live and think as a mute Japanese coal miner in order to penetrate Shatterhand's castle. Tanaka renames Bond \\"Taro Todoroki\\" (\\"First son of thunder\\") for the mission. After infiltrating the Garden of Death and the castle where Blofeld spends his time dressed in the costume of a Samurai warrior, Bond is captured and Bunt identifies him as a British secret agent and not a Japanese coal miner. After surviving a near execution, Bond exacts revenge on Blofeld in a duel, Blofeld armed with a sword and Bond with a wooden staff. Bond eventually kills Blofeld by strangling him with his bare hands in a fit of violent rage, then blows up the castle. Upon escaping, he suffers a head injury, leaving him an amnesiac living as a Japanese fisherman with Kissy, while the rest of the world believes him dead; his obituary appears in the newspapers. While Bond's health improves, Kissy conceals his true identity to keep him forever to herself. Kissy eventually sleeps with Bond and becomes pregnant, and hopes that Bond will propose marriage after she finds the right time to tell him about her pregnancy. Bond reads scraps of newspaper and fixates on a reference to Vladivostok, making him wonder if the far-off city is the key to his missing memory; he tells Kissy he must travel to Russia to find out. Characters and themes The central character in the novel is James Bond himself and the book's penultimate chapter contains his obituary, purportedly written for The Times by M. The obituary provides a number of biographical details of Bond's early life, including his parents' names and nationalities. Bond begins You Only Live Twice in a disturbed state, described by M as \\"going to pieces\\", following the death of his wife Tracy eight months previously. Academic Jeremy Black points out that it was a very different Bond to the character who lost Vesper Lynd at the end of Casino Royale. Given a final chance by M to redeem himself with a difficult mission, Bond's character changes under the ministrations of Dikko Henderson, Tiger Tanaka and Kissy Suzuki. The result, according to Benson, is a Bond with a sense of humour and a purpose in life. Benson finds the transformation of Bond's character to be the most important theme in the novel: that of rebirth. This is suggested in Bond's attempt at a Haiku, written in the style of Japanese poet Matsuo Bash≈ç: The rebirth in question is that of Bond, transformed from the heavy drinker mourning his wife at the beginning of the book to a man of action and then, after the death of Blofeld, becoming Taro Todoroki, the Japanese partner of Kissy Suzuki. While Bond is in his action phase, Benson sees Fleming's writing becoming allegorical and epic, using Bond as a symbol of good against the evil of Blofeld. As in Goldfinger and The Spy Who Loved Me, Bond is referred to as St George in his fight against the dragon, this time by Tiger Tanaka, who says that \\"it would make the subject for a most entertaining Japanese print.\\" According to the author of continuation Bond novels, Raymond Benson, Kissy Suzuki is \\"a most appealing heroine\\" and \\"apparently loves Bond very much.\\" Apart from being the mother of Bond's unborn child at the end of the book, Suzuki also acts as a \\"cultural translator\\" for Bond, helping explain the local traditions and customs; Quarrel had the same function in Live and Let Die and Dr. No. Academic Christoph Lindner identifies Tiger Tanaka as one of Fleming's characters with morals closer to those of traditional villains, but who act on the side of good in support of Bond; others of this type have included Darko Kerim (From Russia, with Love), Marc-Ange Draco (On Her Majesty's Secret Service) and Enrico Colombo (\\"Risico\\"). Blofeld makes his third appearance in the Bond series in You Only Live Twice and Benson notes that on this occasion he is quite mad and egocentric in his behaviour; Tanaka refers to him as \\"a devil who has taken human form\\". Comentale, Watt and Willman note that Fleming, through Bond, parallels Blofeld with Caligula, Nero and Hitler, and that this exemplifies Blofeld's actions as being on \\"a titanic scale\\", as much of the criminal action was throughout the Bond series. Lindner echoes this, noting that the crimes perpetrated are not against individuals per se, but entire nations or continents. Much in the novel concerns the state of Britain in world affairs. Black points out that the reason for Bond's mission to Japan is that the US did not want to share intelligence regarding the Pacific, which it saw as its \\"private preserve\\". As Black goes on to note, however, the defections of four members of MI6 to the Soviet Union had a major impact in US intelligence circles on how Britain was viewed. The last of the defections was that of Kim Philby in January 1963, while Fleming was still writing the first draft of the novel. Black contends that the conversation between M and Bond allows Fleming to discuss the decline of Britain, with the defections and the 1963 Profumo affair as a backdrop. The theme of Britain's declining position in the world is also dealt with in conversations between Bond and Tanaka, Tanaka voicing Fleming's own concerns about the state of Britain in the 1950s and early 60s. Tanaka accuses Britain of throwing away the empire \\"with both hands\\"; this would have been a contentious situation for Fleming, as he wrote the novel as the Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation was breaking out in December 1962, a direct challenge to British interests in the region. Fleming's increasingly jaundiced views on America appear in the novel too, through Bond's responses to Tiger's comments, and they reflect on the declining relationship between Britain and America: this is in sharp contrast to the warm, co-operative relationship between Bond and Leiter in the earlier books. Background You Only Live Twice is the twelfth book (the eleventh novel) of Fleming's Bond series and the last book completed by Fleming before his death. The story is the third part of the Blofeld trilogy, coming after Thunderball, where SPECTRE is introduced, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, where Blofeld is involved in the murder of Bond's wife. You Only Live Twice was the last book by Fleming that was published in his lifetime: he died five months after the UK release of the novel. It was written in January and February 1963 in Jamaica at Fleming's Goldeneye estate. The original manuscript was 170 pages long and the least revised of all Fleming's novels, with a mood that is dark and claustrophobic, reflecting Fleming's own increasing melancholia. The story was written after the film version of Dr. No was released in 1962, and Bond's personality was somewhat skewed towards the screen persona rather than simply to Fleming himself; Sean Connery's filmic depiction of Bond affected the book version, with You Only Live Twice giving Bond a sense of humour and Scottish antecedents that were not present in the previous stories, although Fleming himself was part Scottish. Correspondence dating back to 1960 shows that Fleming contacted a Scottish nobleman to help develop Bond's family history, in particular seeking a Scottish \\"Bond\\" family line. Fleming's first trip to Japan was as part of the Thrilling Cities trip undertaken for The Sunday Times in 1959, although his visit only lasted for three days. He returned in 1962 and was accompanied on his trip round the country by Australian friend Richard Hughes and Tiger Saito, both journalists. In You Only Live Twice, these two characters became Dikko Henderson and Tiger Tanaka, respectively. Hughes was also the model for \\"Old Craw\\" in John le Carr√©'s The Honourable Schoolboy. The novel contains a fictional obituary of Bond, purportedly published in The Times, which provided details of Bond's early life, although many of these were Fleming's own traits. These included Bond's expulsion from Eton College, which was part of Fleming's own history. As with a number of the previous Bond stories, You Only Live Twice used names of individuals and places that were from Fleming's past. Bond's mother, Monique Delacroix, was named after two women in Fleming's life: Monique Panchaud de Bottomes, a girl Fleming was engaged to in the early 1930s, with Delacroix taken from Fleming's own mother, whose maiden name was Ste Croix Rose. Bond's aunt was called Charmian Bond: Charmian was the name of Fleming's cousin who married Richard Fleming, Ian's brother. Charmian's sister was called \\"Pet\\" which, when combined with the Bottom from Monique Panchaud de Bottomes, gives Pett Bottom, where Charmian lives. Pett Bottom is also the name of a real place which amused Fleming when he stopped for lunch after a round of golf at Royal St George's Golf Club, Sandwich. Ernst Stavro Blofeld's name partially comes from Tom Blofeld, a Norfolk farmer and a fellow member of Fleming's club Boodle's, who was a contemporary of Fleming's at Eton. Tom Blofeld's son is Henry Blofeld, a sports journalist, best known as a cricket commentator for Test Match Special on BBC Radio. For Blofeld's pseudonym in the novel, Dr. Guntram Shatterhand, Fleming uses the name of an old caf√© he had seen in Hamburg in 1959 (\\"Old Shatterhand\\", a fictional character penned in a series of Western stories along with Winnetou by German writer Karl May). The characterisation of him dressed as a samurai was taken from the sketch Fleming had come up with thirty five years earlier for a character called Graf Schlick. Release and reception You Only Live Twice was published in the UK on 16 March 1964, by Jonathan Cape and cost sixteen shillings. There were 62,000 pre-orders for the book, a significant increase over the 42,000 advance orders for the hardback first edition of On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Richard Chopping, cover artist for The Spy Who Loved Me, was engaged for the design. On 17 July 1963, Michael Howard of Jonathan Cape had written to Chopping about the artwork, saying: \\"I have had a talk with Ian about the ideas for the ingredients of this design. He is very much in favour of the toad ... but with a suitable array of oriental embellishrangment, i.e. toad plus Japanese flower arrangements, which he thinks should be sitting in a suitable piece of Japanese pottery, perhaps ornamented with a dragon motif. If you could manage a pink dragonfly sitting on the flowers, and perhaps just one epicanthic eye peering through them he thinks that will be just splendid!\\" Chopping's fee rose to 300 guineas for the cover from the 250 guineas he received for The Spy Who Loved Me. You Only Live Twice was published in the United States by New American Library in August 1964; it was 240 pages long and cost $4.50. =Reviews= Cyril Connolly, reviewing You Only Live Twice in The Sunday Times, wrote that Fleming's latest book was \\"reactionary, sentimental, square, the Bond-image flails its way through the middle-brow masses, a relaxation to the great, a stimulus to the humble, the only common denominator between Kennedy and Oswald\\". The critic for The Times was largely unimpressed with You Only Live Twice, complaining that \\"as a moderate to middling travelogue what follows will just about do ... the plot with its concomitant sadism does not really get going until more than half way through\\". In contrast to the previous novels, The Times continued, \\"though Mr. Fleming's macabre imagination is as interesting as ever, some of the old snap seems to have gone\\". Dealing with the cliffhanger ending to the story, the reviewer wrote that \\"Mr. Fleming would keep us on tenterhooks, but at this rate of going even his most devoted admirers will free themselves before very long.\\" The critic for The Spectator felt that \\"Ian Fleming has taken a hint from films of his books and is now inclined to send himself up. I am not at all sure that he is wise\\", while The Belfast Telegraph considered that Fleming was \\"still in a class of his own.\\" The Bookman declared that You Only Live Twice \\"must rank among the best of the Bonds\\". Malcolm Muggeridge, writing in Esquire magazine, disagreed, writing that \\"You Only Live Twice has a decidedly perfunctory air. Bond can only manage to sleep with his Japanese girl with the aid of colour pornography. His drinking sessions seem somehow desperate, and the horrors are too absurd to horrify ... it's all rather a muddle and scarcely in the tradition of Secret Service fiction. Perhaps the earlier novels are better. If so, I shall never know, having no intention of reading them.\\" Maurice Richardson, in The Observer, thought You Only Live Twice \\"though far from the best Bond, is really almost as easy to read as any of them\\". He was critical of a number of aspects, saying that the \\"narrative is a bit weak, action long delayed and disappointing when it comes but the surround of local colour ... has been worked over with that unique combination of pubescent imagination and industry which is Mr. Fleming's speciality.\\" In The Guardian, Francis Iles wrote that \\"I think he [Fleming] must be getting tired of the ineffable James Bond and perhaps even of writing thrillers at all\\". Iles reasoned that \\"of the 260 pages of You Only Live Twice ... only 60 are concerned with the actual business of a thriller\\", and his enjoyment was further diminished by what he considered \\"the grossness of Bond's manners and his schoolboy obscenities\\". Peter Duval Smith, in the Financial Times, was in two minds about the book, believing on the one hand that \\"the background is excellent ... Mr. Fleming has caught the exact 'feel' of Japan\\", and on the other that You Only Live Twice \\"is not really a success and it's Bond's fault mainly. He just doesn't add up to a human being\\". Maggie Ross, in The Listener, was also a little dissatisfied, writing that the novel can be read as a thriller and, \\"if interest flags, as it may do, the book can be treated as a tourist guide to some of the more interesting parts of Japan.\\" She went on to say that \\"since not very much in the way of real excitement happens until the latter half of the book, perhaps it is better to ignore the whole thing\\". Robert Fulford, in the Toronto-based magazine Maclean's, noted that \\"the characteristic which makes Fleming appear so silly also helps make him so popular: his moral simplicity. When we read James Bond we know whose side we are on, why we are on that side and why we are certain to win. In the real world that is no longer possible.\\" Charles Poore, writing in The New York Times, noted that Bond's mission \\"is aimed at restoring Britain's pre-World War II place among the powers of the world. And on that subject, above all others, Ian Fleming's novels are endlessly, bitterly eloquent.\\" The Boston Globes Mary Castle opined that the agent's trip was \\"Bond's latest and grimmest mission\\", which she called \\"Escapism in the Grand Manner\\". Adaptations Sean Connery played Bond in the 1967 cinema adaptation ;Daily Express serialisation (1964) You Only Live Twice was adapted for serialisation in the Daily Express newspaper on a daily basis from 2 March 1964 onwards. ;Playboy serialisation (1964) You Only Live Twice was serialised in the April, May and June 1964 issues of Playboy magazine. ;Comic strip (1965‚Äì1966) Ian Fleming's novel was adapted as a daily comic strip published in the Daily Express newspaper, and syndicated worldwide.

A speaker or writer who produces a hypercorrection generally believes through a misunderstanding of such rules that the form is more \\"correct\\", standard, or otherwise preferable, often combined with a desire to appear formal or educated.Sociolinguistic Patterns, William Labov, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1972, p 126 Linguistic hypercorrection occurs when a real or imagined grammatical rule is applied in an inappropriate context, so that an attempt to be \\"correct\\" leads to an incorrect result. It does not occur when a speaker follows \\"a natural speech instinct\\", according to Otto Jespersen and Robert J. Menner. Hypercorrection can be found among speakers of less prestigious language varieties who attempt to produce forms associated with high-prestige varieties, even in situations where speakers of those varieties would not. Some commentators call such production hyperurbanism. Hypercorrection can occur in many languages and wherever multiple languages or language varieties are in contact. Types of over-applied rules Studies in sociolinguistics and applied linguistics have noted the over-application of rules of phonology, syntax, or morphology, resulting either from different rules in varieties of the same language or second-language learning. An example of a common hypercorrection based on application of the rules of a second (aka new, foreign) language is the use of octopi for the plural of octopus in English; this is based on the faulty assumption that octopus is a second declension word of Latin origin when in fact it is third declension and comes from Greek. Sociolinguists often note hypercorrection in terms of pronunciation (phonology). For example, William Labov noted that all of the English speakers he studied in New York City in the 1960s tended to pronounce words such as hard as rhotic (pronouncing the \\"R\\" as rather than ) more often when speaking carefully. Furthermore, middle class speakers had more rhotic pronunciation than working class speakers did. However, lower-middle class speakers had more rhotic pronunciation than upper-middle class speakers. Labov suggested that these lower-middle class speakers were attempting to emulate the pronunciation of upper-middle class speakers, but were actually over- producing the very noticeable R-sound. A common source of hypercorrection in English speakers' use of the language's morphology and syntax happens in the use of pronouns; see the section below. Hypercorrection can also occur when learners of a new-to-them (aka second, foreign) language try to avoid applying grammatical rules from their native language to the new language (a situation known as language transfer). The effect can occur, for example, when a student of a new language has learned that certain sounds of his or her original language must usually be replaced by another in the studied language, but has not learned when not to replace them.Interlanguage Phonology Sources of L2 Pronunciation \\"Errors\\", by Michael Carey English English has no authoritative body laying down and codifying norms for standard usage, unlike some other languages, such as Arabic (Academy of the Arabic Language in Damascus), French (Acad√©mie fran√ßaise) and Hebrew (Academy of the Hebrew Language). Nonetheless, within groups of users of English, certain usages are considered unduly elaborate adherences to \\"formal\\" rules. Such speech or writing is sometimes called hyperurbanism, defined by Kingsley Amis as an \\"indulged desire to be posher than posh.\\" =Personal pronouns= In 2004, Jack Lynch, assistant professor of English at Rutgers University, said on Voice of America that the correction of the subject-positioned \\"me and you\\" to \\"you and I\\" leads people to \\"internalize the rule that 'you and I' is somehow more proper, and they end up using it in places where they should not ‚Äì such as 'he gave it to you and I' when it should be 'he gave it to you and me.'\\"\\"March 11, 2004 ‚Äì Hypercorrection\\", www.voanews.com, 12 March 2004. On the other hand, the linguists Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey K. Pullum write that utterances such as \\"They invited Sandy and I\\" are \\"heard constantly in the conversation of people whose status as speakers of Standard English is clear\\" and that \\"Those who condemn it simply assume that the case of a pronoun in a coordination must be the same as when it stands alone. Actual usage is in conflict with this assumption.\\"Rodney Huddleston and Geoffrey K. Pullum, A Student's Introduction to English Grammar (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005; ), 107. =H-adding= Some British accents, such as Cockney, drop the initial \\"h\\" from words; e.g. have becomes ave. A hypercorrection associated with this is H-adding, adding an \\"h\\" to a word which would not normally have an initial \\"h\\". An example of this can be found in the speech of the character Parker in Thunderbirds, e.g. \\"We'll 'ave the h'aristocrats 'ere soon\\" (from the episode \\"Vault of Death\\"). Parker's speech was based on a real person the creators encountered at a restaurant in Cookham. =Hyperforeignism= Hyperforeignism arises from speakers misidentifying the distribution of a pattern found in loanwords and extending it to other environments. The result of this process does not reflect the rules of either language. For example, habanero is sometimes pronounced as though it were spelled , in imitation of other Spanish words like jalape√±o and pi√±ata.www.merriam-webster.com: habanero (variant spelling) Machismo is sometimes pronounced 'makizmo', apparently as if it were Italian, rather than the phonetic English pronunciation which resembles the original Spanish word. =English as a second language= Some English-Spanish cognates primarily differ by beginning with \\"s\\" vs. \\"es\\", such as the English word \\"spectacular\\" and the Spanish word \\"espectacular\\". A native Spanish speaker may conscientiously hypercorrect for the word \\"establish\\" by writing or saying \\"stablish\\", which is archaic, or an informal pronunciation in some dialects. Serbo-Croatian As the locative case is rarely found in vernacular usage in southern and eastern dialects of Serbia, and accusative is used instead, speakers tend to overcorrect when trying to deploy the standard variety of the language in more formal occasions, thus using locative even when accusative should be used (typically, when indicating direction rather than location): \\"Izlazim na kolovozu\\" instead of \\"izlazim na kolovoz\\". Hebrew and Yiddish Ghil'ad Zuckermann argues that the following hypercorrect pronunciations in Israeli Hebrew are snobbatives (from snob + -ative, modelled upon comparatives and superlatives):See p. 77 in Zuckermann, Ghil'ad (2003), Language Contact and Lexical Enrichment in Israeli Hebrew. Palgrave Macmillan. * the hypercorrect pronunciation khup√≠m instead of khof√≠m for \\"beaches\\". * the hypercorrect pronunciation tsorf√°t instead of tsarf√°t for \\"France\\". * the hypercorrect pronunciation am√°n instead of om√°n for \\"artist\\". The last two hypercorrection examples derive from a confusion related to the Qamatz Gadol Hebrew vowel, which in the accepted Sephardi Hebrew pronunciation is rendered as but which is pronounced in Ashkenazi Hebrew, and in Hebrew words that also occur in Yiddish. On the other hand, the Qamatz Qa·π≠an vowel, which is visually indistinguishable from the Qamatz Gadol vowel, is rendered as in both pronunciations. This leads to hypercorrections in both directions. #The consistent pronunciation of all forms of qamatz as , disregarding qatan and hataf forms, could be seen as a hypercorrection when Hebrew speakers of Ashkenazic origin attempt to pronounce Sephardic Hebrew, for example, , \\"midday\\" as \\"tzaharayim\\", rather than \\"tzohorayim\\" as in standard Israeli pronunciation; the traditional Sephardi pronunciation is \\"tzahorayim\\". This may, however, be an example of oversimplification rather than of hypercorrection. #Conversely, many older British Jews consider it more colloquial and \\"down-home\\" to say \\"Shobbes\\", \\"cholla\\" and \\"motza\\", though the vowel in these words is in fact a patach, which is rendered as in both Sephardi and Ashkenazi Hebrew. Other hypercorrections occur when speakers of Israeli Hebrew (which is based on Sephardic) attempt to pronounce Ashkenazi Hebrew, for example for religious purposes. The month of Shevat () is mistakenly pronounced \\"Shvas\\", as if it were spelled *. In an attempt to imitate Polish and Lithuanian dialects, qamatz (both gadol and qatan), which would normally be pronounced , is hypercorrected to the pronunciation of holam, , rendering (\\"large\\") as goydl and (\\"blessed\\") as boyrukh. Spanish In some Spanish dialects, the final intervocalic () is dropped, such as in pescado (fish), which would typically be pronounced but can be manifested as dialectically. Speakers sensitive to this variation may insert a intervocalically into a word without such a consonant, such as in the case of bacalao (cod), correctly pronounced but occasionally hypercorrected to . Swedish In Swedish, the word \\"att\\" is sometimes pronounced when used as an infinitive marker (its conjunction homograph is never pronounced that way, however). The conjunction \\"och\\" is also sometimes pronounced the same way. Both pronunciations can informally be spelled \\"√•\\". (\\"Jag √§lskar √• fiska √• jag tycker ocks√• om √• baka.\\") When spelled more formally, the infinitive marker is sometimes misspelled \\"och\\". (\\"F√• mig och hitta tillbaks.*\\") The third person plural pronoun, pronounced \\"dom\\" in many dialects, is formally spelled \\"de\\" in the subjective case and \\"dem\\" in the objective case. Informally it can be spelled \\"dom\\" (\\"Dom tycker om mig.\\") When spelled more formally, they are often confused with each other.

It is the second-largest city in Sindh and 8th largest in Pakistan. Founded in 1768 by Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro of the Kalhora Dynasty, Hyderabad served as a provincial capital until the British transferred the capital to Bombay presidency in 1847. Toponymy The city was named in honour of Ali, the fourth caliph and cousin of the Prophet Muhammad. Hyderabad's name translates literally as \\"Lion City\\" - from haydar, meaning \\"lion,\\" and ƒÅbƒÅd, which is a suffix indicating a settlement. \\"Lion\\" references Ali's valour in battle, and so he is often referred to as Ali Haydar, roughly meaning \\"Ali the Lionheart,\\" by South Asian Muslims. History =Founding= Pacco Qillo was built on a limestone outcropping known as Ganjo Takkar. The River Indus was changing course around 1757, resulting in periodic floods of the then capital of the Kalhora dynasty, Khudabad. Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro decided to shift the capital away from Khudabad, and founded Hyderabad in 1768 over a limestone ridge on the eastern bank of the Indus River known as Ganjo Takkar, or \\"Bald Hill.\\" The small hill is traditionally believed to have been the location of the ancient settlement of Neroon Kot, a town which had fallen to the armies of Muhammad Bin Qasim in 711 CE. When the foundations were laid, the city came to be known by the nickname Heart of the Mehran. Devotees of Imam Ali advised Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro to name the city in honour of their Imam. The Shah of Iran later gifted the city a stone which purportedly bears the imprint of Ali's feet. The stone was placed in the Qadamgah Maula Ali, which then became a place of pilgrimage. =Kalhora= The tomb of Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro Mian Sarfraz Kalhoro. In 1768, Mian Ghulam Shah Kalhoro ordered a fort to be built on one of the three hills of Hyderabad to house and defend his people. The fort was built using baked clay bricks, earning it the name Pacco Qillo, meaning Strong Fort in Sindhi. The fort was completed in 1769, and is spread over 36 acres. Mian Ghulam Shah also built the \\"Shah Makki Fort,\\" commonly known as Kacha Qila, to fortify the tomb of the Sufi saint Shah Makki. Hyderabad remained the Kalhora capital during the period in which Sindh was united under their rule. Attracted by the security of the city, Hyderabad began to attract artisans and traders from throughout Sindh, thereby resulting in the decline of other rival trading centres such as Khudabad. A portion of the population of Khudabad migrated to the new capital, including Sonaras, Amils and Bhaibands. Those groups retained the term \\"Khudabadi\\" in the names of their communities as a marker of origin. Mian Ghulam Shah died in 1772, and was succeeded by his son, Sarfraz Khan Kalhoro. In 1774, Sarfraz Khan built a \\"New\\" Khudabad north of Hala in memory of the old Kalhoro capital, and attempted to shift his capital there. The attempt failed, and Hyderabad continued to prosper while New Khudabad was abandoned by 1814. A formal plan for the city was laid out by Sarfraz Khan in 1782. =Talpur= The Tombs of Talpur Mirs date from the 18th century. Mir Fateh Ali Khan Talpur captured the city of Khudabad from the Kalhoros in 1773, and made the city his capital. He then captured Hyderabad in 1775, and shifted his capital there in 1789 after Khudabad once again flooded. Renovation and reconstruction of the city's fort began in 1789, and lasted for 3 years. Celebrations were held in 1792 to mark his formal entry in the Pacco Qillo fort, which he made his residence and held court. Talpur rule maintained Hyderabad's security, and the city continued to attract migrants from throughout Sindh, turning the city into a major regional center. Lohana Hindus from Afghanistan migrated to the city and set up ship as metalworkers. The city's goldsmiths, silversmiths, and leather tanners began to export their Hyderabadi wares abroad. The city's textile industry boomed with the arrival of Susi and Khes cotton cloth and handicrafts from towns in rural Sindh. The city's became renowned for its calligraphers and bookbinders, while its carpet dealers traded carpets from nearby Thatta. Henry Pottinger traveled up the Indus River in the early 1830s on behalf of the British. He claimed to have seen 341 ships over the course of 19 days at Hyderabad, indicating its importance as a major trading center by this time. Hyderabad's goods were mostly exported to markets in Khorasan, India, Turkestan, and Kashmir - though some Hyderabadi wares were displayed at The Great Exhibition of 1851 in London. In order to use the Indus River for commercial navigation to Punjab, the British signed a treaty with the rulers of Hyderabad and Khairpur that guaranteed the British free passage along the Indus and through Sindh. Mir Murad Ali was pressured into accepting an 1838 treaty which resulted in the stationing of a British Resident in the city. The British also signed a treaty of \\"eternal friendship\\" with the Talpur rulers of Hyderabad in the early 19th century, who promised not to allow the French to set up residency in Sindh. In 1839, they were pressured into forcing another treaty that guaranteed the British trade and security privileges. =British= Hyderabad's Badshahi Bungalow was built as the palace of Prince Mir Hassan Ali Khan Talpur in 1863. Hyderabad in the late 1800s. The triangular structures on the rooftops are wind catchers, funneling cool breezes into homes below. The British defeated the city's Talpur rulers at the Battle of Hyderabad on 24 March 1843. The provincial capital was then transferred to Bombay Presidency by the British general Sir Charles Napier. Being the last stronghold in Sindh, the conquered city was the final step in the British Conquest of Sindh. Following the success of the British, several of the city's Talpur Mirs rulers were exiled and died in Calcutta. Their bodies were eventually brought back to Hyderabad, and were buried in the Tombs of the Talpur Mirs located at the northern edge of the Ganjo Hill. Hyderabad's prosperity did not initially decline after the shifting of Sindh's capital to Bombay Presidency. Merchants there forged links with the commercial community in Hyderabad, and began exporting Hyderabadi wares to distant markets. Following Sindhi's assimilation into the Bombay Presidency in 1847, the city emerged as hub for a style of handicrafts known as Sindwork that was peddled in Bombay, and prized by its European residents for its perceived authenticity of style. The work was then shipped from Bombay to Egypt in order to be sold as souvenirs to tourists there. Hyderabadi traders also spread east towards Singapore and Japan as well. Unable to fulfill demand for its products, Hyderabad's traders began to import crafts from Kashmir, Varanasi, China, and Japan to ease demand. Sindwork handicrafts thus placed Hyderabad at the center of a new trading network that was almost entirely dominated by Hindus from the city's mercantile Bhaiband segment of the Lohana caste, although the artisans themselves were primarily Muslim. The city's jail was built in 1851, and the Municipality of Hyderabad was established in 1853. In the Pacco Qillo the British kept the arsenal of the province, transferred from Karachi in 1861, and the palaces of the ex-Amirs of Sind that they had taken over. In 1857, when the Indian mutiny raged across the South Asia, the British held most of their regiments and ammunition in this city. Though the city did not witness major fighting, the British demolished the large round tower that once stood outside of Pacco Qillo, deeming it a potential risk to their rule were it to fall into the hands of rebels. Hyderabad's Rani Bagh (\\"Queen's Garden\\") was established as Das Gardens in 1861, and was re-christened in honour of Queen Victoria. British- style schools were introduced in Hyderabad by the 1860s, while the St Joseph Missionary School was established in 1868. Further European schools were opened, while Hyderabad's Hindu and Muslim elite established schools for their respective communities throughout the British colonial period. A hospital, psychiatric institution, and quarters for officials were built in 1871. By 1872, 43,088 people lived in the city. The city by 1873 had 20 kilometers of metaled roads that were lit at night by kerosene lamps. The newly built urban quarters of Saddar and Soldier Bazaar further expanded the city. The British built a rail network throughout the western part of South Asia in the 1880s, and purchased the private Scinde Railway to connect the province to Kabul trade routes. The rail network would later be called the North-Western State Railway. The Kotri Bridge was completed in 1900 to traverse the Indus, and link Hyderabad to Karachi. Hyderabad's economy grew as a result of improved transportation. The city increasingly developed into a consumer market under British rule, and the city's exports began to decline, though increased transit trade allowed the city's economy to continue growing. In 1901, 69,378 people lived in the city. Hinduism was the most dominant religion with 43,499 followers, while 24,831 Muslims made up the largest religious minority. The city ranked seventh in the Bombay Presidency in terms of population. By 1907, the Gazetteer of Sindh claimed that 5,000 Hyderabadi merchants were to be found dispersed throughout the world. The city's Navalrai Clock Tower was built in 1914. Bengali poet Rabindranath Tagore remarked in the early 20th century that Hyderabad was the \\"most fashionable\\" city in all of India. =Modern= The City of Hyderabad served as the capital of Sindh province between 1947 and 1955. The Partition of British India resulted in the large- scale exodus of much of the city's Hindu population, though like much of Sindh, Hyderabad did not experience the widespread rioting that occurred in Punjab and Bengal. In all, less than 500 Hindu were killed in Sindh between 1947-48 as Sindhi Muslims largely resisted calls to turn against their Hindu neighbours. Hindus did not flee Hyderabad en masse until riots erupted in Karachi on 6 January 1948, which sowed fear in Sindhi Hindus despite the fact that the riots were local and regarded Sikh refugees from Punjab seeking refuge in Karachi. The Hindus who departed had played a major role in the city's economy, and formed the majority of the Hyderabad's population. The vacuum left by the departure of much of the city's Hindu population was quickly filled by newly arrived refugees from India, known as Muhajirs. By 1951, 66% of the city was made up of Muhajirs. Though Hyderabad became a majority Urdu-speaking city in the 1940s, the arrival of Pashtuns and Punjabis from northern Pakistan further diversified the city's ethnic composition over the next few decades. Animosity between Urdu and Sindhi speakers first arose in 1967, it intensified under the Pakistan People's Party government in the 1970s, which were widely perceived by Muhajirs to be a pro-Sindhi administration. Violence erupted between Urdu and Sindhi speakers during riots in 1971 when the provincial government wished to impose Sindhi-language requirements on Urdu speakers, and again in 1972 in reaction to the 1972 Sindhi Language Bill. The Khuda Ki Basti housing scheme was launched in Hyderabad 1981 as a way to provide housing to low-income residents by forming local cooperatives pool funds to gradually provide increased services that would in turn be managed by community members. Success of the project resulted in the programme being launched in Karachi as well. The late 1980s saw turbulent ethnic rioting between Sindhis and Muhajirs. On 30 September 1988, militants from the Sindh Progressive Party drove into Muhajir dominated areas in the city, and opened indiscriminate fire in busy crossroads. The so-called \\"Hyderabad Massacre\\" resulted in the deaths of over 60 people in a single day, and more than 250 deaths in total. In a backlash, more than 60 Sindhi speaking people were gunned down in Karachi. The city began to divide itself ethnically, and the Muhajir population migrated en masse from Qasimabad and the interior of Sindh into Latifabad. Similarly, Sindhis moved to Qasimabad from Hyderabad and Latifabad. Further ethnic disturbances occurred in May 1990, including a police-led siege of the Pacco Qillo fortress in the center of Hyderabad, in which Muhajir activists claim 150 were killed. 2 bombings on trains in Hyderabad killed 10 people in 2000. Much of Hyderabad's public spaces have been encroached upon by illegally-constructed homes and businesses. Much of the city's historic structures are badly neglected, with little preservation being undertaken by the provincial administration. Demographics =Population= Hyderabad is home to 1,732,693 people as per the 2017 Census of Pakistan. The city gained 565,799 residents since the 1998 Census, representing an increase of 48.5% - the lowest growth rate of the ten largest Pakistani cities. Sindhi woman on the banks of the River Indus in the outskirts of Hyderabad =Ethnicity= Hyderabad was a majority Sindhi Hindu city prior to 1948, when many migrated to India and elsewhere after the independence of Pakistan 1947. Hindus who departed had played a major role in the city's economy, and formed the majority of the Hyderabad's population. The vacuum left by the departure of much of the city's Hindu population was quickly filled by the newly arrived Urdu speaking Muslim refugees from India, known as Muhajirs. Following the arrival of Muhajirs, Hyderabad became a majority Urdu-speaking city, with Muhajirs making up 66% of the city's population. The arrival of Pashtuns and Punjabis from northern Pakistan further diversified the city's ethnic composition over the next few decades, and by 1998, the percentage of Urdu speakers had fallen to 58%. Most Punjabis and Pakhtuns are distinct and separately living near the railway station and its vicinity. The city therefore has cosmopolitan atmosphere with multiethnic and multicultural communities. The city is now a multi-ethnic and has a mix of Sindhi, Urdu speaking Muhajirs, Brahuis, Punjabis, Pashtuns, Memons and Baloch people. =Religion= Hyderabad is noteworthy in Sindh and Pakistan generally for its comparative tolerance towards religious and ethnic minorities. The spread of Islamist militancy and extremism has been stymied in large parts of Sindh by vibrant civil society, and Sindh's progressive politics. The city has a long association with Sufism. In the 18th Century Syeds from Multan migrated and settled in the city's Tando Jahania neighbourhood, making it a sacred place for Muslims. The Syeds came from Uch Sharif, via Jahanian, 42 km from Multan). They were mostly descendants of Jahaniyan Jahangasht - a Sufi saint who is popular in Sindh and southern Punjab. Hyderabad is near some of Sindh's most important Sufi shrines, being situated from the joint Muslim-Hindu Shrine at Odero Lal, from the Shrine of Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai, from the Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar.Google Maps Hindus once formed the majority in Hyderabad prior to 1948, and today account for the largest religious minority in Hyderabad - forming 5% of the total population of the city. Hyderabad's Amil Hindus clan of the Lohana caste had been employed previously the Talpur Mirs for their Persian language proficiency and skills in bureaucracy - this role continued under the British as the Amils were recruited into colonial administration. The Amils formed the Amil Colony, which was where some of Hyderabad's finest colonial architecture was found. The Bhaiband clan, also of the Lohana caste, dominated commerce in the city. While Christians account for 1% of the total population, Hyderabad is the seat of a Diocese of the Church of Pakistan and has five churches and a cathedral. Geography  Sunset over the Indus at Hyderabad. =Location= Located at 25.367 ¬∞N latitude and 68.367 ¬∞E longitude with an elevation of , Hyderabad is located on the east bank of the Indus River and is roughly away from Karachi, the provincial capital. Two of Pakistan's largest highways, the Indus Highway and the National Highway join at Hyderabad. Several towns surrounding the city include Kotri at , Jamshoro at , Hattri at and Husri at . =Climate= Hyderabad has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen BWh), with warm conditions year-round. The city is famous for its winds which moderate the otherwise hot climate. As a result, Hyderabadi homes traditionally feature \\"wind-catching\\" towers that funnel breezes down into living quarters in order to alleviate heat. The period from mid-April to late June (before the onset of the monsoon) is the hottest of the year, with highs peaking in May at . During this time, winds that blow usually bring along clouds of dust, and people prefer staying indoors in the daytime, while the breeze that flows at night is more pleasant. Winters are warm, with highs around , though lows can often drop below at night. The highest temperature of was recorded on 25 May 2018, while the lowest temperature of was recorded on 8 February 2012. In recent years, Hyderabad has seen great downpours. In February 2003, Hyderabad received of rain in 12 hours, leaving many dead. The years of 2006 and 2007 saw close contenders to this record rain with death tolls estimated in the hundreds. The highest single-day rain total of was recorded on 12 September 1962, while the wettest month was September 1962, at . =Topography= The city was initially founded on a limestone ridge on the eastern bank of the Indus River known as Ganjo Takkar, or \\"Bald Hill.\\" The limestone outcropping provided several scenic vistas in the city, as well as inclined routes. The most famous incline, the Tilak Incline, is named after the early 20th century independence activist Lokmanya Tilak. Economy The industrial sector contributes 25% to the GDP of Pakistan, with a major concentration of industry in an arc stretching from Karachi to Hyderabad. 75% of Sindh's industry is located in the Karachi-Hyderabad region. The Sindh Industrial Trading Estate, home to 439 industrial units, was established on the outskirts of Hyderabad in 1950 which prospered with until the urban violence of the 1980s. Much of the city's industrial base was weakened by ethnic violence in urban Sindh in the 1980s, although poor infrastructure and supply of electricity has also hampered growth. Hyderabad is an important commercial center where industries includes: textiles, sugar, cement, manufacturing of mirror, soap, ice, paper, pottery, plastics, tanneries, hosiery mills and film. There are hide tanneries and sawmills. Handicraft industries, including silver and gold work, lacquer ware, ornamented silks, and embroidered leather saddles, are also well established. Hyderabad produces almost all of the ornamental glass bangles in Pakistan, as well as layered glass inlay for jewelry. The glass industry employs an estimated 300,000-350,000 people in manufacturing units centered on the Churi Parah neighbourhood. The industry frequently uses recycled glass as material for its bangles. Hyderabad is surrounded by fertile alluvial plains, and is a major commercial center for the agricultural produce of the surrounding area, including millet, rice, wheat, cotton, and fruit. Cityscape =Local architecture= Hyderabad's local architectural patterns reflect the region's harsh climate and local customs. Walls of most traditional-style buildings were made of mud bricks, which helped keep the structure cool in summer and warm in winter. Hyderabad is famed for its heat-relieving winds, and so homes also featured wind-catchers that directed cool breezes into each homes' living quarters. Residential structures in Hyderabad's Old City, and in Hirabad typically have a small inward facing courtyard that afforded privacy from the city's streets. Walls facing the street are typically plain, though the home may display an elaborate entryway. Inner courtyards and doorways of more elaborate homes would be decorated with jharoka balconies, floral motifs, ornamented ceilings, and decorative arches. Most residential homes, however, were utilitarian in design. Homes built during the British colonial period contain introduced architectural elements like balconies and decorative columns as part of an elaborate outward-facing fa√ßade. Such examples can be found in the Saddar neighborhood of Hyderabad. Large decorated windows were featured as part of Hyderabad's colonial style in order to ventilate the building. Tall and multi-sectional windows with stained glass windows became a hallmark of Hyderabad's colonial-era architecture. Homes of wealthy residents, especially among the city's Bhaiband community, the presence of windows was a marker of status, and allowed wealthy Hindus to practice the custom of purdah. Balconies were sometimes affixed to the front of a building, and were typically made of wood or cast-iron. Such homes would also sometimes have painted facades. Civic administration Before the government of Abubaker Nizamani, the District Hyderabad included the present-day District of Badin. The longest-serving mayor of Hyderabad was Jamil Ahmed, who served from 1962 to 1971. In 2005/2006, General Pervaiz Musharraf again divided it into four more districts Matiyari, Tando Allahyar, Tando Mohammad Khan and Hyderabad. Hyderabad district was subdivided into four talukas # Hyderabad City Taluka # Hyderabad Taluka (rural) # Tando Jam # Latifabad # Qasimabad = Judiciary = Court of District & Sessions Judge Hyderabad was established in 1899 under the subordination of Judicial Commissioner of Sindh. Transportation =Road= The M-9 motorway is a 6 lane motorway that connects Hyderabad to Karachi, 136 kilometers away. The city will also be connected to Sukkur by the M-6 motorway, being built as part of the wider China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. From Sukkur, motorways will continue onward to Multan, Lahore, Islamabad, Faisalabad, and Peshawar. =Rail= Hyderabad Junction railway station serves as the city's main rail station. Hyderabad Junction railway station serves as the city's main rail station. Passenger services are provided exclusively by Pakistan Railways. The city's station is serviced by the Allama Iqbal Express to Sialkot, the Badin Express, and the Khyber Mail to Peshawar. Hyderabad has trains to Nawabshah, Badin, Tando Adam Junction, Karachi, and points in northern Pakistan. =Air= Hyderabad Airport is no longer served by commercial air traffic. The last services were suspended in 2013. Passengers must now instead rely entirely on Karachi's Jinnah International Airport. Education 75% of males and 65% of females over the age of 10 were literate in Hyderabad District in 2010, a region which includes rural areas around the city. In 2010-2011, 2.96 Billion Rupees were spent on public education in Hyderabad District, and number which increased to 3.99 Billion Rupees in 2011-2012. 26% of children in Hyderabad District were enrolled in paid private schools in 2010. The University of Sindh was founded in Karachi in 1947, before moving to Hyderabad in 1951. The Liaquat University of Medical and Health Sciences was founded in nearby Jamshoro in 1951. Sports The Niaz Stadium of Hyderabad, with a seating capacity of 15,000 is home to the Hyderabad cricket team since 1961. It is known for Pakistani bowler Jalal-ud- Din's hat-trick, which was the first ever hat-trick taken by a bowler in a one-day match in 1982. Hyderabad also has a hockey stadium. Landmarks * Pacco Qillo * Tombs of Talpur Mirs * Rani Bagh * Sindh Museum * Hyderabad Cantonment Media =Literature= As tradition goes, Sindh had always been a hub for Sufi poets. With a foothold on strong educational foundations, the city of Hyderabad was made into a refuge for thriving literary advocates. Of the few, Mirza Kalich Beg received education from the Government High School, Hyderabad and carried the banner of Sindhi literature across borders. Modern novelists, writers, columnists and researchers like Musharraf Ali Farooqi, Ghulam Mustafa Khan and Qabil Ajmeri also hail from Hyderabad. Hyderabad has served many Sindhi literary campaigns throughout the history of Pakistan as is evident from the daily newspapers and periodicals that are published in the city. A few worth mention dailies are the Kawish, Ibrat, and Daily Sindh. =Radio and television= With the inauguration of a new broadcasting house at Karachi in 1950, it was possible to lay the foundations for the Hyderabad radio station in 1951. The initial broadcast was made capable using 1 kW medium-wave transmitter. With the first successful transmissions on the FM 100 bandwidth in Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad in October 1998, the Government decided on opening transmissions to other cities where Radio Pakistan had found success. This made available the FM 101 bandwidth transmissions to Hyderabad and other cities in Sindh. A relief from the regular broadcasts in other cities, entertainment content on the Hyderabad radio gave birth to many a star whose names became an attribute to Hyderabad's richer media content. Among them were actor Shafi Mohammad, a young man who had recently finished his postgraduate degree from the University of Sindh. Such fresh and young talent became a trademark to entertainment in Hyderabad. Pakistan Television had only had half-a-decade broadcast success from 1963 to 1969 that people in the radio entertainment business felt destined to make a mark on the television circuits. Prominent radio personalities from the Hyderabad radio station like Shafi Muhammad Shah and Mohammad Ali left the airwaves to hone their acting skills on the television. Television shows and content enriched with the inclusion of Hyderabadi names however PTV never opened a television station in Hyderabad. While the year 2005 saw new FM regular stations set up at Gawadar, Mianwali, Sargodha, Kohat, Bannu and Mithi, private radio channels began airing in and around Hyderabad. Of late, stations like Sachal FM 105 and some others have gained popularity. But the unavailability of an up-to-date news and current affairs platform renders the services of such stations of not much value to the masses but nonetheless appealing to youngsters. As the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (abbreviated as PEMRA) gave licenses to private radio channels, so were television channels owned privately given a right to broadcast from the year 2002, and Daily Kawish, a prominent Sindhi newspaper published from Hyderabad opened a one-of-its-kind private Sindhi channel Kawish Television Network. Many followed in its path namely Sindh TV, Dhoom TV and Kashish TV premiering Sindhi content.

Bussard ( - ) was an American physicist who worked primarily in nuclear fusion energy research. He was the recipient of the Schreiber-Spence Achievement Award for STAIF-2004.STAIF-2004 Archives He was also a fellow of the International Academy of Astronautics and held a Ph.D. from Princeton University.  Kiwi (Rover-A)  In June, 1955 Bussard moved to Los Alamos and joined the Nuclear Propulsion Division's Project Rover designing nuclear thermal rocket engines.Bussard, Robert. \\"Nuclear Rocketry - The First Bright Hopes\\", Astronautics, Vol. 7, No. 12, Dec. 1962, pp. 32-35 Bussard and R.D. DeLauer wrote two important monographs on nuclear propulsion, Nuclear Rocket Propulsion and Fundamentals of Nuclear Flight. Bussard ramjet In 1960, BussardBussard, R.W., ‚ÄúGalactic Matter and Interstellar Flight‚Äù, Acta Astronatica, VI, pp. 179-195, 1960. conceived of the Bussard ramjet, an interstellar space drive powered by hydrogen fusion using hydrogen collected with a magnetic field from the interstellar gas. Due to the presence of high- energy particles throughout space, much of the interstellar hydrogen exists in an ionized state (H II regions) that can be manipulated by magnetic or electric fields. Bussard proposed to \\"scoop\\" up ionized hydrogen and funnel it into a fusion reactor, using the exhaust from the reactor as a rocket engine.R.W.Bussard, \\"Fusion as Electric Propulsion\\", \\"Journal of Propulsion and Power\\" v6 no 5 September‚ÄìOctober 1990, pp 567-574 It appears the energy gain in the reactor must be extremely high for the ramjet to work at all; any hydrogen picked up by the scoop must be sped up to the same speed as the ship in order to provide thrust, and the energy required to do so increases with the ship's speed. Hydrogen itself does not fuse very well (unlike deuterium, which is rare in the interstellar medium), and so cannot be used directly to produce energy, a fact which accounts for the billion-year scale of stellar lifetimes. This problem was solved, in principle, according to Bussard by use of the stellar CNO cycle in which carbon is used as a catalyst to burn hydrogen via the strong nuclear reaction.Whitmire, D. \\"Relativistic spaceflight and the catalytic nuclear ramjet\\", Acta Astronautica, 2, 497-509, 1975. =In science fiction= Bussard Ramjets are common plot devices in science fiction. Larry Niven uses them in his Known Space setting to propel interstellar flight. Following a standard hi-tech faster/cheaper/better learning curve, he started with robot probes during the early stages of interstellar colonization and eventually plotted them as affordable to wealthy individuals relocating their families off a too-crowded Earth (in \\"The Ethics of Madness\\"). Niven also employed Bussard Ramjets as the propulsion / stabilizing engine of the Ringworld (four novels), which were also set in Known Space. In the Star Trek universe, a variation called the Bussard Hydrogen Collector or Bussard Ramscoop appears as part of the matter/antimatter propulsion system that allows Starfleet ships to travel faster than the speed of light. The ramscoops attach to the front of the warp nacelles, and when the ship's internal supply of deuterium runs low, they collect interstellar hydrogen and convert it to deuterium and anti-deuterium for use as the primary fuel in a starship's warp drive.  Atomic Energy Commission  In the early 1970s Bussard became Assistant Director under Director Robert Hirsch at the Controlled Thermonuclear Reaction Division of what was then known as the Atomic Energy Commission. They founded the mainline fusion program for the United States: the Tokamak. In June 1995, Bussard claimed in a letter to all fusion laboratories, as well as to key members of the US Congress, that he and the other founders of the program supported the Tokamak not out of conviction that it was the best technical approach but rather as a vehicle for generating political support, thereby allowing them to pursue \\"all the hopeful new things the mainline labs would not try\\". Bussard's Letter In a 1998 Analog magazine article, fellow fusion researcher Tom Ligon described an easily built demonstration fusor system along with some of Bussard's ideas for fusion reactors and incredibly powerful spacecraft propulsion systems, with which spacecraft could swiftly move throughout the solar system. = The Polywell = Bussard worked on a promising new type of inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC) fusor, called the Polywell, that has a magnetically shielded grid (MaGrid). He founded Energy/Matter Conversion Corporation, Inc. (EMC2) in 1985 to validate his theory, and tested several (15) experimental devices from 1994 through 2006. The U.S. Navy contract funding that supported the work expired while experiments were still small. However, the final tests of the last device, WB-6, reputedly solved the last remaining physics problem just as the funding expired and the EMC2 labs had to be shut down. Further funding was eventually found, the work continued and the WB-7 prototype was constructed and tested, and the research is ongoing.Should Google Go Nuclear? = Appeal for funding = During 2006 and 2007, Bussard sought the large-scale funding necessary to design and construct a full-scale Polywell fusion power plant. His fusor design is feasible enough, he asserted, to render unnecessary the construction of larger and larger test models still too small to achieve break-even. Also, the scaling of power with size goes as the seventh power of the machine radius, while the gain scales as the fifth power, so there is little incentive to build half-scale systems; one might as well build the real thing. On March 29, 2006, Bussard claimed on the fusor.net internet forum that EMC¬≤ had developed an inertial electrostatic confinement fusion process that was 100,000 times more efficient than previous designs, but that the US Navy budget line item that supported the work was zero-funded in FY2006. Bussard provided more details of his breakthrough and the circumstances surrounding the end of his Navy funding in a letter to the James Randi Educational Foundation internet forum on June 23. From October 2, 2006 to October 6, 2006, Bussard presented an informal overview of the previous decade of his work at the 57th International Astronautical Congress.The Advent of Clean Nuclear Fusion: Super-performance Space Power and Propulsion, Robert W. Bussard, Ph. D., 57th International Astronautical Congress, October 2‚Äì6, 2006. This was the first publication of this work in 11 years, as the U.S. Navy had put an embargo on publications of the research, in 1994. Bussard presented further details of his IEC fusion research at a Google Tech Talk on November 9, 2006, of which a video was widely circulated. Bussard presented more of his thoughts on the potential world impact of fusion power at a Yahoo! Tech Talk on April 10, 2007.Askmar summary of IEC fusion (The video is only available internally for Yahoo employees.) He also spoke on the internet talk radio show The Space Show, Broadcast 709, on May 7, 2007.

Clifford, was an English novelist and journalist, and the wife of the philosopher William Kingdon Clifford. Biography Lucy Clifford was born Lucy Lane in London, the daughter of John Lane of Barbados. She married the mathematician and philosopher William Kingdon Clifford in 1875. After his death in 1879, she earned a prominent place in English literary life as a novelist, and later as a dramatist. Her best-known story, Mrs Keith's Crime (1885), centres on euthanasia.XIX Century Fiction. Part I: A‚ÄìK. Jarndyce Bloomsbury, 2019. It was followed by several other volumes, such as Aunt Anne (1892). She also wrote The Last Touches and Other Stories (1892) and Mere Stories (1896), and several plays between 1898 and 1925. She is perhaps most often remembered as the author of The Anyhow Stories, Moral and Otherwise (1882), a collection of stories she had written for her own children. Lucy Clifford also wrote cinematic adaptations of her short stories and plays. At least two films were produced from these: The Likeness of the Night (1922), directed by Percy Nash, and Eve's Lover (1925), directed by Roy Del Ruth. Her wide circle of literary friends included Henry James. Her daughter Ethel Clifford (died 1959), later Lady Dilke as the wife of Sir Fisher Wentworth Dilke, 4th Baronet (1877‚Äì1944), was a published poet. Lucy Clifford died in 1929, and was buried alongside her husband in Highgate Cemetery, London. In 2004 Gowan Dawson described Lucy's efforts to uphold the reputation of Clifford after his death: :...Clifford's disconsolate widow and two young daughters had been left totally unprovided for, and, notwithstanding a subsequent Testimonial Fund and Civil List pension, it was necessary for Lucy Clifford, who now owned the copyright of her late husband's works, to maximise the potential sales of his posthumous publications, not only by keeping Clifford in the public eye, but by ensuring that it was a generally positive (and thus marketable) portrayal of him that was presented.

He was the first known aboriginal Oxford scholar; a successful CEO of a multinational financial institution; a native statesman; an athlete of international standing; and an outspoken champion of the rights of women, children, and minorities. Once thought to be the first Native M.D. in Canada, a recent book on Dr. Peter Edmund Jones, an Ojibwa from New Credit, has shown Jones to have graduated few months before Dr. Oronhyatekha. While all this would be remarkable in any age, that he achieved it during the Victorian era, when racism and assimilation were commonplace, has made him a figure approaching legend in some aboriginal circles. Biography Born 10 August 1841 on the Six Nations of the Grand River near Brantford, Ontario, he was the sixth son of Peter Martin and Lydia Loft (from Tyendinaga), and one of up to eighteen children. He first attended the Mohawk Institute residential school and learned the shoemaker trade. He attended the Wilbraham Wesleyan Academy in Wilbraham, Massachusetts. After graduating, he taught for a year among the Indians and then entered Kenyon College for three years. Oronhyatekha was selected at the age of twenty by the Six Nations Iroquois Confederacy (consisting of the Mohawk, Oneida, Onondaga, Cayuga, Seneca, and Tuscarora Nations) to give the welcoming address to the Prince of Wales during his visit to the New World. Legend has it that Prince Edward was sufficiently impressed that he urged the young Oronhyatekha to attend the University of Oxford, where he himself had attended, but correspondence between Oronhyatekha and the Prince's physician Henry Acland suggests it was really Acland's idea. Acland taught at Oxford and became Oronhyatekha's mentor and friend for the rest of their lives. Oronhyatekha matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford in May 1862, and was befriended by Outram Marshall, who took him under his wing.Keith Jamieson, Michelle A. Hamilton, Dr Oronhyatekha: Security, Justice, and Equality (Dundurn, 2016), p. 77 However, he returned home shortly afterwards, in June of that year, to clear his name of charges made by the Six Nations missionary Abraham Nelles. Returning to Canada, he married Ellen Hill or Karakwineh (meaning ‚Äúmoving sun‚Äù), and enrolled in the Toronto School of Medicine in 1863. He graduated with his B.M. in 1865 and his M.D. in 1866. In 1866, he also served in the Queen's Own Rifles during the Battle of Ridgeway, one of the armed conflicts of the Fenian Raids of that year. After graduation, he practiced at Frankford, Stratford, Napanee, Buffalo, NY, and London, Ontario. As his medical practice grew, he also became a figure of increasing importance in Victorian Canada. In 1871, he became a member of Canada's National Rifle Team which competed at Wimbledon, and in 1874, was elected the President of the Grand Council of Indian Chiefs, a provincial organization largely made up of Anishinabe and Iroquoian communities in southwestern Ontario. In 1878, while living in London, he applied to become a member of the Independent Order of Foresters, a fraternal and financial institution. The Foresters' statutes explicitly limited its membership to white men and Orangemen, but Oronhyatekha was an Orangeman. By 1881 he had become Supreme Chief Ranger of Foresters, the organisation's international CEO, a position that he held for a record 26 years. In 1889, he moved to Toronto, where the IOF headquarters had relocated. During his tenure as SCR, he transformed the order into one of the wealthiest fraternal financial institutions in the Victorian world; today, it counts more than one-million members in North America and the European Union. Oronhyatekha was an active Orangeman and served as County Grand Master of Middlesex Country Orange Lodge.Beyond the Banners: The Story of the Orange Order, pg. 102 While heading the Foresters, he built one of the first North American museums created by a Native individual.Michelle A Hamilton, Collections and Objections: Aboriginal Material Culture in Southern Ontario. Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, 2010; Trudy Nicks, \\"Dr. Oronhyatekha's History Lessons: Reading Museum Collections as Texts,\\" Reading Beyond Words. Contexts for Native History. Ed. Jennifer S.H. Brown and Elizabeth Vibert. Peterborough: Broadview Press, 2003, 459-489. It was housed in the Foresters' Temple which once stood at the corner of Bay and Richmond in Toronto, until shortly after his death, and contained natural history artifacts, items from Canadian Native groups, and from cultures around the world. The artifacts were transferred to the Royal Ontario Museum in 1911. For its time, the Temple was the tallest office building in the British empire and incorporated the latest technology such as electric elevators and lights, both of which were powered by an electrical plant in the basement, a chilled drinking water system, and extensive fireproofing. The Temple also featured many amenities for its staff, including its own newsstand, cafe and dining room, smoking room, meeting rooms, and bicycle storage. He belonged to the International Order of Good Templars, several branches of the Masonic Order, the Ancient Order of United Workmen, the Knights of the Maccabees, and the Orange Order. He was the Worshipful Master of Richardson Masonic Lodge in Stouffville, Ontario in 1894. In the 1890s, he purchased an island across from Deseronto which he renamed Foresters' Island. Here, he built a second family home, an IOF meeting and dining hall, a bandstand, the Isle Hotel and cottages for guests, and a wharf at which boats from the mainland could dock. While the hotel seems to have been open for all guests, not just IOF members, he hosted huge IOF gatherings each summer to celebrate its anniversaries. Colour postcard of \\"Orphans' Home, Foresters Island near Deseronto, Ont.\\", published by Valentine & Sons Co. Ltd.Ironically, the one achievement of which Oronhyatekha was most proud was the enterprise his contemporaries regarded as his only significant failure. In 1904, he created an orphanage on the Bay of Quinte, Ontario, It opened for operations in 1906, and Oronhyatekha described it as his life's crowning achievement. He did not live to see it be sold in 1908 due to his death after stopping off to visit President Theodore Roosevelt in Savannah, Georgia a year earlier. He and Ellen had six children, only two of whom survived to adulthood. Three of his children died very early. One son, Henry, drowned at the age of 10 during the sinking of the Victoria on the Thames River in London, Ontario, on Victoria Day of 1881. His eldest child, Catherine, married Percy John Johnson, an Australian, and his son Acland, also a medical doctor married twice. Neither had any children. Acland died a few months after his father. Oronhyatekha has been commemorated with several designations, including a plaque erected by the Toronto Historical Board in Allan Gardens in Cabbagetown where he lived in Toronto. His house at 209 Carlton is listed in the Cabbagetown heritage inventory and is part of the Cabbagetown Heritage District. A nearby lane has been named Dr. O Lane. His former home in London, Ontario, at 172 Central (formerly Litchfield) Avenue, is currently under consideration for local designation. The Temple building which would have easily qualified for historic status, was demolished in the 1970s, but his sculpture by Walter Seymour Allward moved to the IOF new headquarters at 789 Don Mills Road. Parks Canada designated him as a national historic person in 2001, erecting a plaque at Tyendinaga. In 2002, the Royal Ontario Museum and the Woodland Cultural Centre curated an exhibit called Mohawk Ideals, Victorian Values which featured his museum collection, once displayed at the IOF Temple building.

Although it was established in 1987, the music company was formed as RCA/Ariola International in 1985 as a joint venture to combine the music label activities of RCA Corporation's RCA Records division and Bertelsmann's Ariola Records and its associated labels which include Arista Records. It consisted of the BMG Music Publishing company, the world's third largest music publisher and the world's largest independent music publisher, and (since August 2004) the 50% share of the joint venture with Sony Music, which established the German American Sony BMG from 2004 to 2008. Acquisition The joint venture with Sony Music was set up in August 2004. It reduced the Big Five record companies to the Big Four record companies. At that time, the company had a 21.5% share in the global music market. Sony Music and BMG remained separate in Japan, although BMG Music Japan was wholly owned by Sony BMG. On 27 March 2006, The New York Times reported that Bertelsmann was looking to raise money by leveraging some of its media assets, and that executives from both companies were in talks about possibly altering the current venture. Bertelsmann sold its 50% share of Sony BMG to Sony Corporation of America for a total of $1.5 billion, and the company was renamed back to Sony Music Entertainment Inc. While officially withdrawing from the business of recorded music, Bertelsmann continued its strong presence in other areas of the music industry by establishing BMG Rights Management, which specializes in music rights management and by representing artists and authors. It is focused mainly in BMG's European stronghold markets. The basis of the company was formed through BMG's decision to withhold selected European music catalogues from the former Sony BMG joint venture and the BMG Publishing businesses. Also kept separate from the acquisition by Sony Corporation of America was Sony BMG's wholly owned and operated BMG Japan. Sony Music Japan remained independent from the Sony BMG joint venture, therefore BMG and Sony labelling were kept separate in Japan under the venture. During Sony BMG's buyout, BMG Japan was instead picked up by Sony Music Entertainment Japan. It briefly continued to operate as a distinct entity until a reorganization in early 2009 folded the company into Sony Music Japan.

Brentwood- Benson Music Publishing is BMG Music Publishing's Christian publisher and owns over 60,000 copyrights. BMG Music Publishing and its assets have now been completely absorbed and folded into Universal Music Publishing Group. BMG Rights Management After Sony bought out Bertelsmann's share in Sony BMG, Bertelsmann was allowed to keep the rights to several recordings from the former joint venture and rights to BMG trademark. These songs served as the foundation to BMG Rights Management. The company was originally founded with capital support of KKR, and later became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann. It now serves as a division within Bertelsmann and as a replacement to the defunct Bertelsmann Music Group. Criticism = CD price fixing = Between 1995 and 2000 music companies were found to have used illegal marketing agreements such as minimum advertised pricing to artificially inflate prices of compact discs in order to end price wars by discounters such as Best Buy and Target in the early 1990s. A settlement in 2002 included the music publishers and distributors; Sony Music, Warner Music, Bertelsmann Music Group, EMI Music and Universal Music. In restitution for price fixing they agreed to pay a $67.4 million fine and distribute $75.7 million in CDs to public and non-profit groups but admitted no wrongdoing. It is estimated customers were overcharged by nearly $500 million and up to $5 per album.

He is known for a fingerpicking style that draws on blues, jazz, and folk music, and for syncopated, polyphonic melodies. He overcame a series of personal obstacles, including partial loss of hearing and a nearly career-ending bout with tendon damage in his right hand, to emerge as a widely recognized master of his instrument. He currently resides in the Minneapolis area with his family. Focusing primarily on instrumental composition and playing, Kottke also sings sporadically, in an unconventional yet expressive baritone described by himself as sounding like \\"geese farts on a muggy day\\".1994 James Jensen interview with Kottke , solidairrecords.com; accessed April 29, 2008. In concert, Kottke intersperses humorous and often bizarre monologues with vocal and instrumental selections from throughout his career, played solo on 6- and 12-string guitars. Biography =Early life and career= Born in Athens, Georgia, Kottke moved with his parents so frequently that he was raised in twelve different states.Ankeny, Jason; accessed September 27, 2008 [ All Music Review] As a youth living in Muskogee, Oklahoma, he was influenced by folk and delta blues music, notably that of Mississippi John Hurt. Kottke learned to play trombone and violin before trying the guitar and developing his own unconventional picking style. A mishap with a firecracker permanently damaged the hearing in his left ear, a condition that would be exacerbated by exposure to loud noise during firing practice while he served in the United States Navy Reserve, when the hearing in his other ear was also damaged.Life in Northern Colorado interview, May 2007 ; accessed May 30, 2008. After being discharged from the Naval Reserve because of his partial loss of hearing, Kottke attended St. Cloud State College (now St. Cloud State University), in Minnesota, but left before completing his studies, choosing instead to hitchhike around the country, busking for a living, before finally settling in the Twin Cities. He arrived at the Scholar Coffeehouse in the Cedar-Riverside area of Minneapolis in the autumn of 1966 and soon was a regular performer. There, he recorded his debut album, 12-String Blues, which was released on the independent Oblivion record label in 1969. He recorded 6- and 12-String Guitar (also known as the \\"Armadillo album\\", after the animal pictured on its cover) for John Fahey's Takoma Records later the same year. It remains one of the works most closely associated with Kottke and has been re-released many times on various record labels. Fahey's agent Denny Bruce signed Kottke to Capitol Records, and in 1971 Capitol released Kottke's first major label record, Mudlark. Kottke in concert, Kansas City, 2008 In the early 1970s, he recorded with vocals and backing musicians on albums. In 1972, he released Greenhouse and, in 1973, the live My Feet Are Smiling and Ice Water. Kottke closed out his contract with Capitol with his seventh album, Chewing Pine, in 1975. By then, he had gained an international following largely due to his performances at folk festivals. With his 1976 eponymous release, he moved to Chrysalis Records. =Injury and new playing style= In the early 1980s, Kottke began to suffer from painful tendinitis and related nerve damage caused by his vigorous and aggressive picking style (particularly on the 12-string guitar).James Jensen Interview with \\"Mr. Natural\\" ; accessed April 29, 2008. As a result, he changed his picking style to a classical style, using the flesh of his fingertips and increasingly small amounts of fingernail rather than fingerpicks, and changing the positioning of the right hand to place less stress on the tendons. He studied more classical and jazz-oriented compositional and playing techniques. He took a long break from recording and performing and simultaneously moved from his relationship with major labels to the smaller Private Music label. Private Music was considered a new-age music label in the Windham Hill style, and Kottke often found his music categorized as such during this period. After the reflective A Shout Toward Noon, in 1986, he took a brief break from recording before returning with Regards from Chuck Pink in 1988. =Later career= Kottke released an album annually from 1989 to 1991: My Father's Face, followed by That's What and then Great Big Boy, which featured guest appearances by Lyle Lovett and Margo Timmins. Two years later, he returned with Peculiaroso, produced by Rickie Lee Jones. The solo album One Guitar, No Vocals was released in 1999. In 2004, Kottke released another solo album, Try and Stop Me (2004). In 2002, Kottke and Mike Gordon (the bassist from the band Phish, which was on an extended hiatus) collaborated on Clone, an album featuring instrumental work and vocals from both musicians. A second album from the pair, Sixty Six Steps, followed in 2005. The duo toured in support of both albums.\\"Kottke and Gordon: Calypso-Brushed Guitars\\" (interview and performance) by David Dye, from NPR's World Cafe, November 24, 2005. In August 2020, Kottke and Gordon announced a new collaborative album, Noon, released that month on Megaplum/ATO Records. It was their first collaboration since Sixty Six Steps and Kottke's first studio album since 2005. Kottke received an honorary Doctorate in Music Performance from the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMilwaukee on May 18, 2008, where he gave the commencement address.Guitarist Kottke receiving UWM honorary degree, onmilwaukee.com, May 30, 2008; accessed August 8, 2014. Kottke at City Winery, New York City, March 2014 Tunings Kottke's guitars are often tuned unconventionally; early in his career he heavily used open tuning, while in recent years he has used more traditional settings but often tunes his guitars as many as two full steps below standard tuning.Leo Kottke Anthology: liner notesMonterey County Weekly: Neo Leo, March 2013; accessed February 5, 2015.; accessed February 5, 2015. Orchestral works, re-recordings, and other collaborations In 1976, Kottke collaborated with arranger Jack Nitzsche on the release Leo Kottke, which featured Kottke backed by a small orchestral section on a number of tracks. In the later part of his career, he has begun reworking and re-recording tunes he wrote and recorded in the early 1970s. For example, 1999's One Guitar No Vocals offered a new instrumental version of 1974's \\"Morning Is the Long Way Home\\", with the countermelody opened up from behind the vocal line, stripped of its original trippy lyrics.; accessed April 29, 2008. Kottke combined previously recorded tunes into new compositions, notably the mini-suite \\"Bigger Situation\\", also released on One Guitar No Vocals. In 1990, he and composer Stephen Paulus created Ice Fields, a work for amplified acoustic guitar and orchestra in a concerto format. Ice Fields featured five movements, each based on an existing Kottke composition, with orchestral backing and interlude sections.Stropes, John. \\"In Search of the Great American Guitar Concerto\\", Acoustic Guitar Magazine, March 1991; accessed August 8, 2014. It was premiered by Paulus's Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and has been performed occasionally since but has not been released on record, partly because of the high cost of producing a recording with a full orchestra.

Kellermann and his research have been strongly disputed by gun rights organizations, in particular by the National Rifle Association, although Kellermann's findings have been supported by a large body of peer-reviewed research finding that increasing gun ownership is associated with increased rates of homicide and violence. Education Kellermann received a Bachelor of Science with distinction in biology from Rhodes College (1976), an M.D. from the Emory University School of Medicine (1980), and an M.P.H. from the University of Washington School of Public Health (1985). Career Kellermann was a professor of emergency medicine and public health at Emory School of Medicine from 1999 to 2010. He co-chaired the Institute's Committee on the Consequences of Uninsurance, which produced six reports on \\"America's uninsured crisis: Consequences for health and health care\\" from 2001 to 2004.

Kellermann is a fellow of the American College of Emergency Physicians and an elected member of the US National Academy of Sciences in the Institute of Medicine. In a recent article published in Health Affairs, he advocated a number of changes to the military health system, including using medically-trained enlisted members such as medics and corpsmen as \\"primary care technicians\\" in the stateside care system. He argued that their skills are currently under-utilized while not deployed, and that increasing the number of primary care providers would improve health outcomes and reduce costs.Rethinking The United States‚Äô Military Health System. Arthur Kellermann, Health Affairs. 27 April 2017 =Research= Kellermann's work includes more than 200 scientific and lay publications on various aspects of advanced cardiac life support, health services research, injury prevention and the role of emergency departments in providing health care to the poor. Kellermann is known for his research on the epidemiology of firearm-related injuries and deaths in the US. In a 1995 interview, Kellermann said he saw firearm injuries not as random, unavoidable acts but as preventable public health priority. Kellermann's studies, which indicate an increased risk of mortality associated with gun ownership, have been disputed by gun rights organizations, in particular by the National Rifle Association; although Kellermann's findings have been supported by a large body of peer-reviewed research finding that increasing gun ownership is associated with increased rates of homicide and violence. Kellermann published several high-profile studies on the topic of gun-related injuries. In 1986, he coauthored a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine finding that for every self-defense homicide via firearm, there were 43 suicides, criminal homicides, or accidental gunshot deaths. He coauthored additional studies published in the New England Journal of Medicine identifying firearm ownership as a risk factor for both homicide and suicide in the home. Gary Kleck argued that most of the homicides in the 1993 study were not committed with the same gun kept in the household the decedent lived in. Kellermann responded that the mechanism behind the observed effect needed not result from the same gun kept in the household, but by the decedents having used these guns in failed self-defense. Kellermann has published extensively in the areas of emergency medicine and public health, including studies of emergency cardiac care, use of diagnostic technologies in the emergency department, and on the use of progesterone as a treatment for traumatic brain injury. He has also published research on the role of emergency departments in providing health care to the poor, the role of insurance, and the situation of the uninsured. In recent years, he has written about domestic preparedness to respond to different forms of terrorism. Kellermann was instrumental in the planning and implementation of the American Heart Association's \\"Racing the Clock to Restart Atlanta's Hearts\\" initiative. He also played a role in the Institute of Medicine‚Äôs three-volume report on the Future of Emergency Care in the United States.

Founded in 1865 in Worcester, WPI was one of the United States' first engineering and technology universities and now has 14 academic departments with over 50 undergraduate and graduate degree programs in science, engineering, technology, management, the social sciences, and the humanities and arts, leading to bachelor's, master's and PhD degrees. WPI's faculty works with students in a number of research areas, including biotechnology, fuel cells, information security, surface metrology, materials processing, and nanotechnology. It is classified among \\"R2: Doctoral Universities ‚Äì High research activity\\".  History  Worcester Polytechnic Institute was founded by self-made tinware manufacturer, John Boynton, and Ichabod Washburn, owner of the world's largest wire mill. Boynton envisioned science schooling that would elevate the social position of the mechanic and manufacturer, but not necessarily teach the skills needed to become either. Washburn, on the other hand, wanted to teach technical skills through a sophisticated apprenticeship approach. Boynton consulted Seth Sweetser, a pastor, for ways to realize his vision. By chance it happened that Ichabod Washburn had previously consulted Sweetser about the proper way to actualize his own vision. URL accessed on July 8, 2012 John Boynton (left) and Ichabod Washburn (right). Washburn was disappointed to learn of Boynton's offer to create a college, although Washburn claimed, \\"I prefer to be imposed upon by others rather than by myself in withholding where I ought to give,\\" with the help of Sweetser's diplomacy and wisdom, he agreed to build, furnish, and endow a \\"Department of Practical Mechanics\\" at Boynton's school. He specified, however, that every student should blend theory learned in the classroom with practice in the shops. Sweetser drafted a letter expressing Boynton's and Washburn's wish to other significant men within Worcester County. The document was sent to 30 Worcester businessmen. It told of a \\"liberal proposal to found a Free School for Industrial Science\\" in Worcester and called for a meeting later in the month. After that meeting the following notice appeared in the Worcester Palladium: \\"A Gentleman, who for the present withholds his name from the public, offers a fund of $100,000 for the establishment of a scientific school in Worcester, upon the condition that our citizens shall furnish the necessary land and buildings.\\" Further funding and land grants for the university were given by Stephen Salisbury II, who was an influential merchant and later served as the first president of the Institute's board of directors.WPI's Founding Fathers: Stephen Salisbury II Retrieved July 23, 2006 In response to this anonymous request, more than 225 Worcester citizens and the workers at 20 of the city's factories and machine shops contributed to the construction of the original building. On May 10, 1865, after House and Senate approval, the secretary of the commonwealth recorded the Institute as a legal corporation, and it came into formal existence. Boynton Hall, WPI's main administrative building Both Boynton and Washburn died before the opening of the college on November 11, 1868. On that day, Charles O. Thompson, the first president of the Institute stood before WPI's first two buildings named Boynton Hall and Washburn Shops in honor of their respective donors, with their distinctive towers that even then symbolized the institution's two educational objectives of theory and practice, and inaugurated the Worcester County Free Institute of Industrial Science.WPI's Founding Fathers: John Boynton Retrieved July 23, 2006WPI's Founding Fathers: Ichabod Washburn Retrieved July 23, 2006 Washburn Shops, where WPI's first hands-on classrooms and laboratories were built in the 19th century. WPI was led in its early years by president and professor of chemistry Charles O. Thompson.Two Towers: The Story of Worcester Tech 1865‚Äì1965 Retrieved July 23, 2006 Early graduates of WPI went on to become mechanical and civil engineers, as well as artisans, bankers, and enter other prominent occupations. WPI continuously expanded its campus and programs throughout the early twentieth century, eventually including graduate studies and a program in electrical engineering. During World War II, WPI offered defense engineering courses and was selected as one of the colleges to direct the V-12 Navy College Training Program.Two Towers: The Story of Worcester Tech 1865‚Äì1965 Retrieved July 23, 2006 During this time, WPI suffered from the lack of a unified library system, well-maintained buildings, and national recognition. This changed under the leadership of president Harry P. Storke from 1962 to 1969. Storke brought significant change to the school in what would be known as the WPI Plan. The Plan called for the creation of three projects and drastically redesigned the curriculum to address how a student learns. The Storke administration also launched a capital campaign that resulted in the creation of the George C. Gordon Library, added residence halls, an auditorium, and a modern chemistry building. Furthermore, women were first allowed to enter WPI in February 1968.The Miracle at Worcester: The Story of the WPI Plan Retrieved July 23, 2006 The WPI Plan is the guiding principle behind undergraduate education at the Institute today, and is arguably the most notable contribution WPI has made towards science and engineering education. In 2016, the National Academy of Engineering awarded their prestigious Bernard M. Gordon Prize for Innovation in Engineering and Technology Innovation to WPI, recognizing the Institute's groundbreaking approach to engineering education.The National Academy of Engineering Recognizes WPI Retrieved October 3, 2018 Today, WPI is primarily an undergraduate focused institution, though expansion of graduate and research programs is a long-term goal. The WPI Bioengineering Institute is a significant contributor to Worcester's growing biotechnology industry. Significant research in other fields such as robotics, metallurgy, untethered health care, fuel cells, the learning sciences, applied mathematics and fire protection currently help establish WPI as an important, specialized research university. Campus Sanford Riley Hall, the first residence hall built on campus (1927) The Beech Tree stands at almost 100 feet tall Earle Bridge Set in an urban context in New England's second largest city, WPI's main campus is entirely privately owned, ungated, and uninterrupted by public roads. The campus sits on Boynton Hill, apart from the adjacent neighborhood, which includes restaurants and stores on Highland Street. Once a laboratory for electromagnetic research, the \\"Skull Tomb\\" was built entirely without ferrous metals. Several years after its construction, electrified trolley tracks were built in Worcester which led to the building's disuse. It served for a time as a site for Robert Goddard's rocket fuel research as the building is relatively isolated from other buildings on campus and Dr. Goddard's research had previously led to explosions on campus. Subsequent to the building earning its present nickname, \\"Skull\\", a secret honor society, inherited the building. The building was reconditioned in 2004. The 'Two Towers' shown in old WPI logos show the clock tower of Boynton Hall and the arm and hammer weathervane of the Washburn Shops. The original weathervane was stolen in October 1975 and never recovered. Boynton and Washburn were the university's first buildings, housing the classrooms and laboratories, respectively. The Two Towers symbolize Theory and Practice, which are the foundation of the university and still the approach used today. Boynton was completed in 1868 and Washburn followed shortly after that same year. Higgins House WPI's school colors, Crimson and Gray, were inspired by the natural pigmentation of the beech tree next to the bush sitting near the entrance of Boynton Hill. The tree was planted in 1945 and presently stands at over 60 feet tall.Worcester Polytechnic Institute Self-Guided Tour , Retrieved on May 3, 2012 Near the edge of the WPI campus is a large Tudor-style mansion built in 1923 by WPI alumnus Aldus Chapin Higgins and later bequeathed to his alma mater.

Academics Kaven Hall is home to the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering Goddard Hall, named for alum Robert H. Goddard Higgins Laboratories WPI offers a variety of majors in engineering, science, management, liberal arts, and social science at the undergraduate and graduate level. It is most well-known for its engineering disciplines and is one of the top-ranked schools to attend for engineering in North America and the world over. Unlike many peer universities, WPI does not combine related departments into colleges or schools. WPI's undergrad schedule is also unusual compared to most universities. Instead of a normal semester, WPI has 7-week terms, labeled A through D, with optional E Terms 1 and 2 in the summer. It is normal to take three courses during each term, which allows students to complete a year's worth of Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, etc. in only one semester. This faster pace allows for students to take more courses to substantiate their diploma. The graduate student calendar follows a conventional two semester schedule. WPI's student performance evaluation system uses grades A, B, or C. If a student were to not satisfactorily complete the course or elect to drop the course, they would receive a No Record (NR). The NR designation is used since there is no differentiation between a dropped course or an unsuccessful attempt to complete it. WPI Corporate and Professional Education (CPE) also offers academic opportunities to individuals and companies. Programs can be offered online, onsite, on campus, or in a blended format. CPE has graduate programs, online degrees and professional development workshops. Among its recent program additions, CPE launched the first online Graduate Certificate in Program Protection Planning, and a new Graduate Certificate focused on Cyber Security for Power Systems. =Project-based learning system= WPI's curriculum is focused on project-based learning, an emphasis established in 1970 as part of what was called the WPI Plan. This allows for a student to learn theory and practices concurrently. This approach includes an Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP) to study the social effects of technology collaboratively with students from other disciplines and a Major Qualifying Project (MQP) that falls within the student's discipline. though they were introduced in the last 40 years. Usually the IQP, and MQP are completed in the junior and senior years, respectively. The MQP is similar to other schools' \\"senior thesis,\\" while the IQP is a bit more unique. Global Projects Program At WPI, the opportunity to complete significant project work off campus is an integral element of an academic program that emphasizes the practical application of knowledge to meaningful technical and societal problems. As of the class of 2022, all first-year students receive a global project scholarship of up to $5,000 for this work. Through the Global Projects Program, over 60% of WPI students complete at least one of their required projects at an off-campus Project Center. Typically, students work under faculty guidance in small teams at Project Centers to address problems posed by external agencies and organizations. Through the Global Projects Program, WPI sends more engineering students abroad than any US college or university. As of the 2019-2020 academic year, the program included established over 50 Project Centers spanning 6 continents. Between 1974, when the first WPI Project Center was established in Washington, DC, and 2014, over 7,000 students had completed over 2,000 projects in locations around the globe. The Global Projects Program was cited by the Association of American Colleges and Universities in 2000, when it named WPI one of its 16 Greater Expectations Leadership Institutions to serve as models for the future of undergraduate education in the United States. Alden Memorial is the main building for the performing arts at WPI, consisting of a performance hall, music rooms, and a computer music lab. The Fountain at WPI. An anemometer adjusts the height of the water based on the wind velocity. Interactive Qualifying Project The Interactive Qualifying Project (IQP) is described as a \\"project which relates technology and science to society or human needs.\\"WPI Projects Program Retrieved July 28, 2006 This project is very broad in scope, encompassing a wide variety of topics and actions. Generally, IQPs are designed to solve a societal problem using technology. This can range from improving high school science education to redesigning an irrigation system in Thailand. This project is often done off-campus through WPI's Global Projects Program. From an educational perspective, the IQP serves to emphasize team-based work and introduces a real-world responsibility absent from courses. Many IQPs have made a significant impact on the community in which they are done. Major Qualifying Project The Major Qualifying Project (MQP) assesses knowledge in a student's field of study. As mentioned above, this project is similar to a senior thesis, with students doing independent research or design. MQPs are often funded by either WPI or external corporations. Topics of MQPs done in the recent past include the design of the MIR 2 space station life support system module, a study of the effects of stress and nicotine on ADHD, the design of a research rocket, a mathematical viscoelastic cell motility model, experimental research of liquid crystals using atomic force microscopy, and the design of polymers for medicine delivery.

The beef brisket is one of the nine beef primal cuts, though the definition of the cut differs internationally. The brisket muscles include the superficial and deep pectorals. As cattle do not have collar bones, these muscles support about 60% of the body weight of standing or moving cattle. This requires a significant amount of connective tissue, so the resulting meat must be cooked correctly to tenderise it. According to the Random House Dictionary of the English Language, Second Edition, the term derives from the Middle English brusket which comes from the earlier Old Norse brj√≥sk, meaning cartilage. The cut overlies the sternum, ribs, and connecting costal cartilages.  Method of cooking  American cuts of beef including the brisket British cuts of beef including the brisket Brisket can be cooked many ways, including baking, boiling and roasting. Basting of the meat is often done during the cooking. This normally tough cut of meat, due to the collagen fibers that make up the significant connective tissue in the cut, is tenderised when the collagen gelatinises, resulting in more tender brisket. The fat cap, which is often left attached to the brisket, helps to keep the meat from drying during the prolonged cooking necessary to break down the connective tissue in the meat. Water is necessary for the conversion of collagen to gelatine, which is the hydrolysis product of collagen. Popular methods in the United States include rubbing with a spice rub or marinating the meat, and then cooking slowly over indirect heat from charcoal or wood. This is a form of smoking the meat. A hardwood, such as oak, pecan, hickory or mesquite is sometimes added, alone or in combination with other hardwoods, to the main heat source. Sometimes, they make up all of the heat source, with chefs often prizing characteristics of certain woods. The smoke from the woods and from burnt dripping juices further enhances the flavor. The finished meat is a variety of barbecue. Smoked brisket done this way is popular in Texas barbecue. Once finished, pieces of brisket can be returned to the smoker to make burnt ends. Burnt ends are most popular in Kansas City-style barbecue, where they are traditionally served open-faced on white bread. The traditional New England boiled dinner features brisket as a main-course option. In the United States, the whole boneless brisket, based on the Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications (IMPS), as promulgated by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), has the meat-cutting classification IMPS 120. The North American Meat Processors Association publishes a photographic version of IMPS called the Meat Buyer's Guide. The brisket muscles are sometimes separated for retail cutting: the lean \\"first cut\\" or \\"flat cut\\" is the deep pectoral, while the fattier \\"second cut\\", \\"point\\", \\"fat end\\", or \\"triangular cut\\" is the superficial pectoral. For food service use, they are IMPS 120A and 120B, respectively. =Other variations= Brisket has a long history in the United States. Brisket is the meat of choice for slow smoking barbecue in Texas, and is often considered the \\"National Dish of Texas\\". In Britain, it is generally not smoked, but is one of a number of low-cost cuts normally boiled with root vegetables and mild spices or cooked very slowly in a lidded casserole dish with gravy. The dish, known as a pot roast in the United States, but more commonly as braised or stewed beef in Britain, is often accompanied by root and tuber vegetables - for example, boiled beef and carrots (as mentioned in the song of the same name) is a well-known dish emblematic of working class cockney culture. Good results may also be achieved in a slow cooker. Cooked brisket, being boneless, carves well after refrigeration, and is a versatile, cheaper cut. In Germany, brisket is braised in dark German beer and cooked with celery, carrots, onions, bay leaves, and a small bundle of thyme. In traditional Jewish cooking, brisket is most often braised as a pot roast, especially as a holiday main course, usually served at Rosh Hashanah, Passover, and on the Sabbath. For reasons of economics and kashrut, it was historically one of the more popular cuts of beef among Ashkenazi Jews. Brisket is also the most popular cut for corned beef, which can be further spiced and smoked to make pastrami. The Jewish community in Montreal also makes Montreal-style smoked meat, a close relative of pastrami, from brisket. Kansas City-style Angus beef brisket and burnt ends dinner from the Q39 restaurant Beef brisket noodles (Philippines) In Hong Kong, it is cooked with spices over low heat until tender, and is commonly served with noodles in soup or curry. In Korean cuisine, traditionally it is first boiled at low temperature with aromatic vegetables, then pressed with a heavy object in a container full of a soy sauce-based marinade. The ensuing preserved meat is served in match-length strips as an accompaniment (banchan) to a meal. This is called jang jorim. Brisket is also the main ingredient in a spicy soup called yuk ke jang, part of the class of soups that are complete meals in Korean cuisine. Nowadays, it is also popular to cook thin slices of it quickly over a hot plate. In Thai cuisine, it is used to prepare suea rong hai, a popular grilled dish originally from Isan in northeastern Thailand. In New Zealand cuisine, it is used in a boil-up. Boiled in seasoned water with green vegetables and potatoes, it is popular amongst Maori people. It is a common cut of meat used in Vietnamese ph·ªü soup. In Italian cuisine, brisket is used to prepare bollito misto, a typical Northern Italy recipe. In Pakistan it is used in nihari, a national dish.

It is the second largest city of the krai (after Barnaul, the administrative center of the krai). Population: Geography The city is called \\"the gates to the Altai Mountains\\", because of its position comparatively not far from this range. Chuysky Highway begins in Biysk and then goes through the Altai Republic to Russia's border with Mongolia. Climate Biysk has a humid continental climate of the (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfb) with very cold, rather dry winters and very warm, damp summers. History The fortress of Bikatunskaya (), or Bikatunsky Ostrog (), was founded in 1708-1709: it was constructed near the confluence of Biya and Katun Rivers (hence the name) in 1709 by the order the Russian Tsar Peter the Great signed in 1708.–û—Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –ë–∏–π—Å–∫–æ–π –∫—Ä–µ–ø–æ—Å—Ç–∏ Yet, in 1710, after a three-day battle, the ostrog was destroyed by the Dzungar people. The Bikatunskaya fortress was re-built at a new place ( up the Biya, on the right bank of the river) in 1718 and renamed Biyskaya () in 1732.

He has written numerous horror and supernatural fiction novels, including Julia and Ghost Story, as well as The Talisman, which he co-wrote with Stephen King. Straub has received such literary honors as the Bram Stoker Award, World Fantasy Award, and International Horror Guild Award. Early life Straub was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, the son of Elvena (Nilsestuen) and Gordon Anthony Straub.Roberts, James P. Famous Wisconsin Authors, Badger Books Inc., 2002, pp. 167‚Äì173. . At the age of seven, Straub was struck by a car, sustaining serious injuries. He was hospitalized for several months, and temporarily used a wheelchair after being released until he had re-learned how to walk. Straub has said that the accident made him prematurely aware of his own mortality.Morgan, John. \\"Stephen King scares up support for fallen friend\\", USA Today, Health section, published February 1, 2002. Retrieved April 29, 2008. Straub read voraciously from an early age, but his literary interests did not please his parents; his father hoped that he would grow up to be a professional athlete, while his mother wanted him to be a Lutheran minister.Roberts, p. 168. He attended Milwaukee Country Day School on a scholarship, and, during his time there, began writing. Straub earned an honors B.A. in English at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison in 1965, and an MA at Columbia University a year later. He briefly taught English at Milwaukee Country Day, then moved to Dublin, Ireland, in 1969 to work on a Ph.D., and to start writing professionally. Career After mixed success with two attempts at literary mainstream novels in the mid-1970s (Marriages and Under Venus), Straub dabbled in the supernatural for the first time with Julia (1975). He then wrote If You Could See Me Now (1977), and came to widespread public attention with his fifth novel, Ghost Story (1979), which was a critical success and was later loosely adapted into a 1981 film starring Fred Astaire. Several horror novels followed, with growing success, including The Talisman and Black House, two fantasy-horror collaborations with Straub's long-time friend and fellow author Stephen King. Straub at the 2010 Brooklyn Book Festival for a panel on how far a writer can go between reality and fantasy.After a fallow period, Straub re-emerged in 1988 with Koko, a nonsupernatural (though horrific) Vietnam novel. Koko was followed in the early '90s by the related novels Mystery and The Throat, which together with Koko make up the \\"Blue Rose Trilogy\\". These complex and intertwined novels extended Straub's explorations into metafiction and unreliable narrators. The ambitious mainstream thriller The Hellfire Club was published in 1996; the novel applied the lessons learned in the Blue Rose period to a more overtly gothic plot. Mr. X followed in 1999 with a doppelg√§nger theme. In 2001, Straub and King reteamed for Black House, a loose sequel to The Talisman tying that book in with King's Dark Tower Series. 2003 saw the publication of a new Straub novel Lost Boy, Lost Girl followed by the related In the Night Room (2004). Both of these novels won Stoker awards. Straub also edited the Library of America volume H. P. Lovecraft: Tales (2005). His novel Mr. X had paid tribute to Lovecraft, as the eponymous Mr. X wrote in a similar style. Straub has also published several books of poetry. My Life in Pictures appeared in 1971 as part of a series of six poetry pamphlets Straub published with his friend Thomas Tessier under the Seafront Press imprint while living in Dublin. In 1972 the more substantial chapbook Ishmael was published by Turret Books in London. Straub's third book of poetry, Open Air, appeared later that same year from Irish University Press. The collection Leeson Park and Belsize Square: Poems 1970 ‚Äì 1975 was published by Underwood-Miller in October 1983. This collection reprints much of Ishmael along with previously uncollected poems, but none of the poems from Open Air. A critical essay on Straub's horror work can be found in S. T. Joshi's book The Modern Weird Tale (2001). At the Foot of the Story Tree by Bill Sheehan discusses Straub's work before 2000. Straub also sits on the contributing editorial board of the literary journal Conjunctions, and he guest-edited Conjunctions: 39, an issue on New Wave Fabulism.Conjunctions:39 ‚Äì The New Wave Fabulists. Fall 2002, edited by Bradford Morrow and Peter Straub. Straub (right) with Rob Hood in 2007 In 2007, Straub's personal papers were acquired by the Fales Library at New York University. February 2010 saw the release of his latest thriller, A Dark Matter.Contest and Trailer for Peter Straub's A Dark Matter In 2016, co-author Stephen King said that he and Straub have plans to write a third Talisman book in the future. King says that the collaboration for the series was ‚Äúnatural,‚Äù and that the two were excited to work together. On Straub‚Äôs contribution to horror fiction, King says, ‚Äúhe brought a poet‚Äôs sensibility to the field, creating a synthesis of horror and beauty‚Äù and ‚Äúhe writes a beautiful prose line that features narrative clarity, sterling characterization, and surprising bursts of humor.‚ÄùTibbetts, John C.

It evolved from an existing band, White Heart. Since 1973 the vocalists for Heart have been the sisters Ann Wilson (lead vocals, flute, guitar) (born June 19, 1950) and Nancy Wilson (vocals, guitar, mandolin) (born March 16, 1954). Over Heart's history, it has consisted of three primary lineups. Heart initially found success when its members moved to Canada, in part to avoid the draft then later in the United States and ultimately worldwide. Heart rose to fame in the mid-1970s with music influenced by hard rock and heavy metal, as well as folk music. The band's popularity declined in the early 1980s but they began a successful comeback in 1985 which continued into the mid-1990s, releasing several hard-rock songs and ballads. Heart disbanded in 1998 then resumed performing in 2002. In the summer of 2019, Heart ended their acrimonious 2016 break-up by launching their \\"Love Alive\\" tour. To date, Heart has sold over 35 million records worldwide, including about 22.5 million of album sales in the U.S. They have placed top 10 albums on the Billboard 200 in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990 and 2010s. Heart was ranked number 57 on VH1's \\"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\\". In 2006, Ann Wilson was listed as one of the \\"Top Heavy Metal Vocalists of All Time\\" by Hit Parader magazine. In 2013, Heart was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. History =1967‚Äì1972: Formation= White Heart/Heart promotional photo (1970); from left: Gary Ziegelman, Ron Rudge, Ken Hansen, Roger Fisher, Steve Fossen, James Cirrello In 1967, bassist Steve Fossen formed a band, The Army, along with Roger Fisher on guitar, Don Wilhelm on guitar, keyboards and lead vocals, and Ray Schaefer on drums.Fossen, Steve They played for several years in and around the Bothell, Washington, area, northeast of Seattle. They frequently played Bothell High School, Inglemoor High School, and Shorecrest High School, as well as many taverns and club venues. In 1969, the band went through line-up changes‚ÄîGary Ziegelman (former lead singer of Buffalo Clancy) on lead vocals, Roger on guitar, Steve on bass, James Cirrello on guitar, Ron Rudge on drums, Ken Hansen on percussion,‚Äîand a new name, White Heart. The name White Heart came from a discussion Roger Fisher's brother Mike Fisher had with Michael Munro, who had come up with the name White Hart (without the \\"e\\", a reference to Arthur C. Clarke's Tales from the White Hart) for a band with Toby Cyr on lead guitar. Fisher asked and received permission to use the name for The Army, added the \\"e\\", and The Army became White Heart. For a brief time in 1970, this line-up shortened its name to Heart and dropped \\"White\\". Founding member Roger Fisher's birthday is Valentine's Day (and the band would release their debut album in the US on that day, as well). The band subsequently went through more personnel changes. In 1971, Heart consisted of Steve Fossen, Roger Fisher, David Belzer (keys), and Jeff Johnson (drums). After Ann Wilson joined (in 1970 or 1972Refer to discussion on talk page.), the band was renamed Hocus Pocus. Mike Fisher, Roger's brother, was set to be drafted into the military. Nancy Wilson has stated that when he did not report for duty, his home was raided, but he slipped out a rear window, escaped to Canada, and became a Vietnam War \\"draft dodger\\".Kelly, Maura. \\"Interview with Nancy Wilson\\", The Believer, August 2007. Retrieved October 1, 2008. One day in 1972 (or 1971), Mike crossed the border to visit family, and by chance met Ann at a Hocus Pocus (or White Heart) show. According to Nancy, that meeting was \\"when she and Michael fell in love\\" and Ann decided to follow Mike back to Canada. Steve Fossen finished his college education before he also decided to move to Canada in late 1972,Bebe Le Strange Epic Records Press Kit. 1980. \\"Steve Fossen was a founding member of Heart in 1972 and 1973 after completing his music major in college\\". and Roger followed in late 1972 or early 1973. Along with Ann, Brian Johnstone (drums), and John Hannah (keyboards), the band Heart was officially formed. Ann's sister Nancy Wilson joined in 1974, and soon after became romantically involved with Roger. =1975‚Äì1976: Commercial breakthrough= The group played numerous shows around their new home in Vancouver, and they recorded a demo tape with the assistance of producer Mike Flicker and session-guitarist and keyboard player, Howard Leese. Hannah and Johnstone had left by this time, and soon after Leese became a full-time member. Flicker produced the band's first five albums. This team recorded the debut album, Dreamboat Annie, at Can-Base Studios in Vancouver (later known as Mushroom Studios). Mike Derosier eventually joined Heart as full-time drummer. Some of the same Canadian investors who had backed the studio also backed a separate company Mushroom Records, which was managed by Shelly Siegel. Drummers Duris Maxwell, Dave Wilson, Kat Hendrikse, and Michael Derosier, keyboardist Rob Deans, and bassist Brian Newcombe were among those who also played on the sessions for the album. The album was picked up by Siegel and sold 30,000 copies in Canada in its first few months. Siegel soon released the album in the US, where, helped by two hit singles in 1976 (\\"Crazy on You\\" and \\"Magic Man\\", which reached numbers 35 and nine, respectively, on the Billboard Hot 100), it reached number seven in the Billboard 200. It eventually sold over one million copies. =1977‚Äì1979: Mainstream success and band split= In 1977, Mushroom Records ran a full-page advertisement showing the bare- shouldered Wilson sisters (as on the Dreamboat Annie album cover) with the suggestive caption, \\"It was only our first time!\\" This event was cited by the Wilson sisters in a July 28, 1977, interview with Rolling Stone as a key part of their decision to leave Mushroom Records. Heart broke its contract with Mushroom and signed a contract with CBS subsidiary Portrait Records, resulting in a prolonged legal battle with Siegel. Mushroom released the partly completed Magazine in early 1977, just before Portrait released Little Queen. Both sides attempted to prevent the other from releasing any Heart music. A Seattle court forced Mushroom Records to recall the album so that Heart could remix tracks and add new vocals, and the album was re-released in 1978. It peaked at number 17 in the US, generating the single \\"Heartless\\", which reached number 24 in the chart, and eventually achieved platinum status. Nancy Wilson (left) and Roger Fisher on stage, 1978 Little Queen became Heart's second million-seller and featured the hit \\"Barracuda\\" (number 11). The song's lyrics were written by an infuriated Ann Wilson in her hotel room after a reporter, while backstage after a live appearance, had suggested that the sisters were lesbian lovers. Ann and Nancy appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone on July 28, 1977 (issue no. 244). Heart performed at the second California Jam on March 18, 1978 at the Ontario Motor Speedway in Ontario, California. Also performing before the 350,000 in attendance were Aerosmith, Ted Nugent, Foreigner, Santana, Bob Welch, Mahogany Rush and Dave Mason. Heart performed at the first Texxas Jam on July 1, 1978 at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas in front of 100,000 people, along with Aerosmith, Van Halen, Ted Nugent, Journey, Frank Marino, Atlanta Rhythm Section, Head East and Walter Egan. Heart also performed at the Texxas Jam in 1979 and 1981. In late 1978, the double-platinum Dog & Butterfly peaked at 17 on the Billboard 200 and produced hits with its title song (number 34) and \\"Straight On\\" (number 15). In 1979, the Wilson-Fisher liaisons ended--Roger Fisher was voted out of the band by the other members, and his brother Mike left the orbit of the group within a month. Nancy Wilson and Howard Leese shared the guitar role, and childhood friend Sue Ennis helped with song collaborations. =1980‚Äì1984: Album success, hit single weakness, strong live performances= Heart released Bebe le Strange in 1980. It became the band's third top-10 album, peaking at number five, and yielded the top-40 hit \\"Even It Up\\". The band embarked on a 77-city tour to promote the album. By the end of the year, the band scored its highest-charted single at the time, a version of the ballad \\"Tell It Like It Is\\", which peaked at number eight. In November 1980, the double album Greatest Hits/Live was released and reached number twelve on the US chart, eventually achieving double-platinum status. The two-disc set featured studio versions of most of Heart's singles to date, plus a few new studio tracks and six live tracks, among which were versions of \\"Unchained Melody\\", Led Zeppelin's \\"Rock and Roll\\" and the Beatles' \\"I'm Down\\". With a total of only two hit singles in 1980 (five singles were actually released) and a hiatus of almost two years until the next studio album, sales following this greatest hits package were weaker than previous efforts. Heart was the first band of the day to appear at the sold-out concert headlined by Queen at Elland Road on May 29, 1982. Their next album, Private Audition (1982), provided the minor hit \\"This Man Is Mine\\" (number 33) and was the first not produced by Mike Flicker. Initially, the band turned to Jimmy Iovine, one of the leading producers of the time, who suggested that the material lacked potential hits, but eventually, the Wilson sisters produced the album themselves. The track \\"Perfect Stranger\\" foreshadowed the power ballads that would dominate the band's mid-1980s sound. At the end of recording, Derosier and Fossen were fired from the band. They were replaced by Denny Carmassi on drums and Mark Andes on bass for Passionworks (1983), while at the record company's insistence, the band turned to established producer Keith Olsen. Both Private Audition and Passionworks had relatively poor sales, failing to reach gold status. Despite the albums' sales, the single \\"How Can I Refuse\\" was a success, reaching number one on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart. In 1984, Ann Wilson recorded a duet with Mike Reno of Loverboy, the pop ballad \\"Almost Paradise\\", which was featured on the soundtrack of the movie Footloose. The song reached number seven on the US pop chart, and strongly influenced the band to use other songwriters and to change their sound. Nancy Wilson made cameo appearances in the films Fast Times at Ridgemont High (1982) and The Wild Life (1984), both written by journalist, screenwriter and director Cameron Crowe, whom she married in June 1986. =1985‚Äì1990: Comeback= The band moved to Capitol Records, and their first album for the label was simply titled Heart (1985). The move to Capitol coincided with a glam metal makeover that included minimizing the acoustic and folk sounds characteristic of their early work. The album reached number one, sold five million copies, and launched four top-10 hits: \\"What About Love\\" (number 10, 1985), \\"Never\\" (number four, composed with Greg Bloch 1985), the chart-topping \\"These Dreams\\" (1986) and \\"Nothin' at All\\" (number 10, 1986). A fifth single, \\"If Looks Could Kill\\", also charted, giving the band five hit singles from the same album for the first time. Heart's next album, Bad Animals (1987), named after reactions to the band when they entered an upmarket Charlotte, NC hotel, continued the move away from the band's folk and acoustic leanings towards a glossier arena rock sound. It contained the hit singles \\"Alone\\" (1987), which reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100, \\"Who Will You Run To\\" (1987), which reached number seven and \\"There's the Girl\\" (1987), which reached number 12. Bad Animals also became the band's first top-10 album success in the UK, peaking at number seven on the UK Album Chart. In 1990, Brigade became the band's sixth multi-platinum LP and added three more top-25 Billboard Hot 100 hits. \\"Stranded\\" reached number 13 and \\"I Didn't Want to Need You\\" peaked at number 23. \\"All I Wanna Do Is Make Love to You\\" reached number twoand was the band‚Äôs only single to reach gold in the RIAA. the but created controversy over whether the song encouraged women to endanger themselves by picking up hitchhikers. Two other album cuts, \\"Wild Child\\" (number 3) and \\"Tall, Dark Handsome Stranger\\" (number 24), were Billboard Mainstream Rock Chart hits. Brigade was the band's highest-charting album in the UK, reaching number three. =1991‚Äì2001: The Lovemongers, Desire Walks On, and Nancy Wilson hiatus= Heart released its first complete live album in the autumn of 1991. Rock the House Live! largely featured tracks from the Brigade album rather than more familiar hits in an effort to capture the harder rock side of the band. The album's single, a version of John Farnham's \\"You're the Voice\\", received moderate airplay on rock stations and hit number 20 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The Wilson sisters then put together an informal acoustic group called the Lovemongers with Sue Ennis and Frank Cox. Their first show was a Red Cross benefit for troops in Seattle. A four-song EP, which included a live version of Led Zeppelin's \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" and an updated version of the Heart standard \\"Crazy On You\\", came out in late 1992. A cover of \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" also appeared on the original soundtrack for the 1992 film Singles. Heart returned in 1993 with Desire Walks On, on which drummer Carmassi was replaced with Denny Fongheiser and bass player Andes was replaced with Fernando Saunders. The album peaked at number 48 on the Billboard 200, eventually being certified gold. The lead track, \\"Black on Black II\\", was an AOR hit peaking at number four on Billboard's Mainstream Rock chart, while the single \\"Will You Be There (In the Morning)\\" was a moderate pop hit, reaching number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100. A third single, \\"The Woman In Me\\", hit number 24 on the Adult Contemporary chart, but missed the Hot 100. An interactive CD-ROM, Heart: 20 Years of Rock & Roll, with five hours of audio footage, was released in 1994. The next album, The Road Home (1995), offered live acoustic versions of the group's best-known songs and was produced by Led Zeppelin's John Paul Jones. In 1995, Nancy Wilson decided to take a break from music to concentrate on raising a family. Ann toured that year with a band that was alternately called the Ann Wilson Band or Ann Wilson and the Ricola Brothers. The Lovemongers released a full- length album titled Whirlygig in 1997, and a collection of mostly self-penned Christmas songs titled Here is Christmas in 1998. This was re-released as a Heart album with the title Heart Presents a Lovemongers' Christmas in 2001. In 1998, the band maintained its profile by being the subject of an episode of VH1's Behind the Music. The band released a Greatest Hits boxed set covering their early work (a second volume focusing on the later part of their career followed in 2000). Also in 1998, Ann toured without Nancy, billed as \\"Ann Wilson and Heart\\". The lineup was the same as it had been in 1995, but without Scott Adams. This was longtime band member Leese's last tour with Heart; he left the band later in the year. Nancy kept busy scoring her husband's movies Jerry Maguire (1996), Almost Famous (2000), Vanilla Sky (2001) and Elizabethtown (2005). In 1999, Nancy released a solo album, Live at McCabe's Guitar Shop. Also in 1999, Nancy and Ann undertook their first tour without a backing band. In 2001, Ann participated in the A Walk Down Abbey Road Beatles tribute tour, which also featured Todd Rundgren, John Entwistle of the Who and Alan Parsons. The sisters also appeared at benefits and special events, including the tribute to Brian Wilson at New York's Radio City Music Hall in March 2001. =2002‚Äì2006: Resumption= In 2002, Ann and Nancy returned to the road with a brand-new Heart lineup that included Scott Olson, Ben Smith, Alice in Chains bassist Mike Inez and keyboardist Tom Kellock. In 2003, Heart released a DVD of the band's last stop in the tour as Alive in Seattle. Also in 2003, Gilby Clarke (ex-Guns N' Roses) and Darian Sahanaja replaced Olson and Kellock for an American tour. In 2004, with the new lineup, Heart released Jupiters Darling, the first studio album since 1993. It featured a variety of songs that included a return to Heart's original hard-rock sound, as well as a blend of vintage pop and new textures. Standout tracks included the singles \\"The Perfect Goodbye\\", \\"Oldest Story in the World\\" (number 22 Billboard Rock Airplay, 2004) and \\"Lost Angel\\". In 2005, the Wilsons appeared on the CMT Music Awards as a special guest of country singer Gretchen Wilson (no relation) and performed the Heart classic \\"Crazy on You\\" with her. Heart also performed with Gretchen Wilson on VH-1's March 10, 2006, tribute to the band, \\"Decades Rock Live!\\". The special also featured Alice in Chains, Phil Anselmo, Dave Navarro, Rufus Wainwright and Carrie Underwood. The concert was released on LP, CD, DVD and Blu-ray on January 25, 2019 with the title Live in Atlantic City. Later in the year, bass player Inez left Heart to rejoin the reformed Alice in Chains. =2007‚Äì2009: VH1 Rock Honors to touring with Journey= Nancy and Ann Wilson in 2007 Heart was honored at the second annual VH1 Rock Honors (May 24, 2007), and also performed along with Ozzy Osbourne, Genesis and ZZ Top. Gretchen Wilson and Alice in Chains honored the group by performing \\"Barracuda\\". In September 2007, Ann Wilson released her first solo album, Hope & Glory, which featured sister Nancy, Elton John, Alison Krauss, k.d. lang, Wynonna Judd, Gretchen Wilson, Rufus Wainwright, Shawn Colvin and Deana Carter. On April 9, 2008, the band appeared on Idol Gives Back with Stacy \\"Fergie\\" Ferguson, who sang \\"Barracuda\\" in harmony with Ann.Idol Gives Back, Americanidol.com In mid-2008, Heart undertook a U.S. tour with Journey and Cheap Trick. In 2008, the band performed in a benefit for music education in public schools, appearing live with Jackson Browne on \\"Something Fine,\\" with Venice on \\"Crazy on You\\" and with over 70 members of the Santa Monica High School orchestra and girls' choir on \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" =2010‚Äì2012: Red Velvet Car to Kennedy Center Honors= A new studio album, Red Velvet Car, was released in 2010. It marked a stylistic return to Heart's melodic hard rock and folk sound of their early albums. The album peaked at number 10 on the Billboard 200, becoming the group's first top-10 album in 20 years. It also reached number three on Billboard's Rock Albums Chart. Red Velvet Car spawned two singles. The folky \\"Hey You\\" peaked at number 26 on Billboard's AC chart, while the hard rocker \\"WTF\\" peaked at number 19 on Billboard's Hot Rock Songs chart. The album release was accompanied by a North American tour, which commenced in January and ran until December 2010.Tour heart-music.com On November 4, 2010, Heart announced it would do its first cross-Canada tour in 30 years, beginning on January 28, 2011, in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. A live DVD and Blu-ray disc, A Night at Sky Church, recorded before the tour at the Experience Music Project in Seattle, was released in 2011. Ann and Nancy Wilson played as part of the 2010 VH1 Divas Support the Troops, along with acts including Katy Perry and Paramore; they performed \\"Crazy on You\\" with Grace Potter and the Nocturnals. In May 2010, a reunion of former male members of the band, including Roger Fisher and Steve Fossen, performed at the Synergia Northwest concert in Tacoma, Washington. Heart embarked on a 2011 summer tour co-headlining with Def Leppard. A career-spanning box-set titled Strange Euphoria was released in June 2012, containing many of the band's biggest hits, unreleased demos and rare live cuts. On September 18, 2012, the Wilson sisters released their autobiography, Kicking and Dreaming: A Story of Heart, Soul, and Rock and Roll, which was co-written with Charles R. Cross (Heavier Than Heaven: A Biography of Kurt Cobain). On September 25, 2012, Ann and Nancy received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their contributions to music. The band released its 14th studio album, Fanatic, on October 2, 2012, which became the group's 12th top-25 album (number 24, 2012) and was supported by a tour of the US and Canada. On December 26, 2012, Ann and Nancy performed at the CBS-televised Kennedy Center Honors in a tribute to Led Zeppelin. Along with an orchestra, two choirs and Jason Bonham (son of late Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham), they performed a version of Led Zeppelin's signature song \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\" Their rendition of \\"Stairway\\" earned a standing ovation from the crowd and tears of joy from Robert Plant. The video went viral on YouTube, with over four million views in the first five days after the show, and prompted the Kennedy Center to issue a limited- edition iTunes single of the performance. Although the single was only available for two weeks, it immediately went to number one on the iTunes Rock Singles chart and reached number 20 on Billboard's Hot Rock Songs chart. =2013‚Äì2016: Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Beautiful Broken= At the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony on April 18, 2013, the original members of Heart (the Wilson Sisters, Howard Leese, Michael Derosier, Steve Fossen, and Roger Fisher) reunited for the first time in 34 years to play \\"Crazy on You\\". The band was inducted by Chris Cornell, who emotionally talked about what heroes and role models Ann and Nancy Wilson had been to him and other musicians in Seattle. \\"For me, and for countless other men and women, they have earned, at long last, their rightful place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\\", Cornell said. In 2014, the band released another live album, Fanatic Live from Caesar's Colosseum which peaked at number 13 on Billboard's Top Hard Rock Albums chart. In January 2016, Ann Wilson announced that Heart was working on a new album that should be completed by June, and released sometime in 2016. Wilson indicated that the new album would be different from 2012's Fanatic which focused primarily on the band's heavier rock side, and would \\"have more contours\\". The new album would follow a tour of Canada (with Joan Jett) and potentially coincide with an early-summer tour of the UK. On June 29, 2016, Heart performed at the Royal Albert Hall with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, and a DVD and CD of this performance were released in November 2016. The album Beautiful Broken was released on July 8, 2016. The hard- rocking title cut featuring Metallicas James Hetfield trading vocals with Ann Wilson was the first single. Beautiful Broken reached number 9 on Billboard's Rock Album Chart and number 30 on Billboard's Top Selling Albums Chart. Immediately following the new album's release, the band embarked on the Rock Hall Three for All, a 30-date headlining tour of the US with Joan Jett and Cheap Trick supporting. = 2016‚Äìpresent: Tour and side projects to reunion = On the morning of August 27, 2016, Ann's husband Dean Wetter was arrested and subsequently pleaded guilty to assaulting Nancy's 16-year-old twin sons after the boys had left the door to his RV open. The incident took place during a Heart performance at the White River Amphitheater in Auburn, Washington, the previous night. Although the band played the remaining 2016 tour dates that were already booked, the Wilson sisters only spoke to one another through third parties for the remainder of the tour. The pair's relationship was strained by the incident; an April 2017 article in Rolling Stone reported that although they remained on amicable terms, they had not spoken to one another since the 2016 tour ended, and only sporadically contacted one another through text messaging. Following the end of the tour in October 2016, the sisters opted to tour with their own side-project bands. In January 2017, Nancy formed a new band, Roadcase Royale, with singer Liv Warfield and Heart members Ben Smith (drummer), Dan Rothchild (bass), and Chris Joyner (keyboards). Later that month, Ann announced a solo tour, which included Heart guitarist Craig Bartock along with some other non-Heart musicians. In April 2017, Ann described Heart as being on hiatus, although both sisters claimed the band had not permanently disbanded. In February 2019, Heart announced their hiatus had ended and that they would embark on the Love Alive tour in the summer. In March 2019, both sisters reunited on stage for the first time since the band went on hiatus, at the Love Rock NYC benefit concert. Although Ann and Nancy were reuniting, the former Heart members who had joined Nancy's solo effort were not invited back and the new lineup consisted of Ann's touring band, replacing Ben Smith on drums, Dan Rothchild on bass, and Chris Joyner on keyboards. In June 2019, the band announced that the Love Alive tour had been extended through October 2019. Style Heart's music crosses multiple genres (see \\"Legacy\\"), has been described as covering everything from \\"folk rock to glossy AOR\\" and has charted singles on Billboard's Hot 100, Mainstream Rock Tracks and Adult Contemporary charts. Legacy Heart has sold over 35 million records worldwide, had 20 top forty singles and seven top-10 albums, and earned four Grammy nominations. The band charted singles and top ten albums on the Billboard charts in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2010s: a four-decade span of top ten albums that is a record for a female-fronted band. Heart was ranked in 2008 as number 57 on VH1's \\"100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock\\", and Ann and Nancy Wilson ranked number 40 (in 1999) on VH1's \\"100 Greatest women in rock and roll\\". Ann Wilson was ranked in Hit Parader's 2006 \\"Greatest Heavy Metal Vocalists of All Time\\" at number 78. In 2009, the Wilson sisters were awarded ASCAP's Founders Award in recognition of their songwriting careers. In 2011, Heart earned its first nomination for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for the 2012 class. After being passed over, the band was nominated again the following year announced as inductees to the 2013 class on December 11, 2012. Their Hall of Fame page describes the Wilson sisters as the first women to front a hard-rock band, and \\"pioneers ... inspir[ing] women to pick up an electric guitar or start a band\\". In his book Heart: In the Studio, Jake Brown described the band as beginning \\"a revolution for women in music ... breaking genre barriers and garnering critical acclaim\\". \\"Heart were the first female-fronted band I heard and was influenced by,\\" recalled Lzzy Hale of Halestorm. \\"I heard Heart and was like, 'Oh, singing like that as a girl is actually a thing!'\\" The Wilson sisters have been active in the Seattle music scene for decades and influenced many musicians from the region, including bands of the grunge era. Artists that have used their Bad Animals Studio include Neil Young, R.E.M., Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains.

Hohokam practiced a specific culture, sometimes referred to as Hohokam culture, which has been distinguished by archeologists. People who practiced the culture can be called Hohokam as well, but more often, they are distinguished as Hohokam people to avoid confusion. Most archaeologists agree that the Hohokam culture existed between 300 and 1500 AD, but cultural precursors may have been in the area as early as 300 BC. Whether Hohokam culture was unified politically remains under controversy. Hohokam culture may have just given unrelated neighboring communities common ground to help them to work together to survive their harsh desert environment. According to the National Park Service website, the word Hohokam is borrowed from the O'odham language and is used by archaeologists to identify a group of people who lived in the Sonoran Desert. Other archaeologists prefer to identify ancient Arizona as part of the Oasisamerica tradition and instead call Hohokam the Oasisamericans. Nevertheless, the Hohokam are one of the four major cultures of the American Southwest and northern Mexico, according to Southwestern archaeology. The origin of Hohokam society is also under controversy. Most archaeologists support either an indigenous or Mesoamerican origin, but Pueblo influences from the northern culture are also present. Hohokam settlements were located on regional trade routes that extended past Hohokam range, from as far east as the Great Plains and as far west as the Pacific coast. Therefore, Hohokam societies received a relatively-high amount of immigration. Some communities established significant markets, such as the one in Snaketown. The harshness of the Sonoran Desert may have been the most influential factor on the society, however. Despite the cultural exchanges that occurred at trade centers, self-sufficiency and local resources were emphasized in communities. Now in Phoenix, the Hohokam are known for their large-scale irrigation networks. Their canal network in the Phoenix metropolitan area was the most complex in ancient North America. A portion of the ancient canals has been renovated for the Salt River Project and now helps to supply the city's water. The original canals were dirt ditches and required routine maintenance, but the ones now in use have been lined with concrete for easier upkeep. When Hohokam society collapsed, the dirt canals fell into disrepair. Some European-American settlers later filled in the canals since they were found to be burdensome. Others rebuilt them, as did the Mormon pioneers who settled the Lehi area of Mesa near Red Mountain. There are several, official spelling variants for the term Hohokam. They include Hobokam, Huhugam, and Huhukam. The spellings are commonly thought to be interchangeable, but they have different meanings. The Hohokam culture was differentiated from others in the region in the 1930s by the archaeologist Harold S. Gladwin. He applied the existing O'odham term for the culture, huhu- kam, in its common mistranslation as \\"all used up\\" or \\"those who are gone\\", to classify the remains that he was excavating in the Lower Gila Valley. Later, in the 1970s, archaeologist Hardy similarly translated the O'odham word Huhugam to mean \\"that which has perished.\\" However, Huhugam refers to past human life and is improperly used if referring to objects such as ruins. Hohokam is therefore an archaeological term referring to a culture and people from a specific period in time and is not to be confused with Huhugam, which refers to reverence for ancestors and descendants. Nevertheless, according to local oral tradition, the Hohokam may be the ancestors of the historic Pima and Tohono O'odham peoples in Southern Arizona.  Overview  Map of Hohokam and neighboring cultures, circa 1350 Hohokam society is primarily associated with the Gila and lower Salt River drainages-wni hohokam in the Phoenix basin. The Phoenix Basin was the Hohokam Core Area, and the Hohokam Periphery were adjacent areas where the Hohokam culture extended. Collectively, the Core and Peripheries formed the greater Hohokam Regional System, which occupied the northern or Upper Sonoran Desert in Arizona. The Hohokam also extended into the Mogollon Rim. The Hohokam Core was located along rivers, and as such inhabited a prime trade position. Trade occurred between the Patayan, who were situated along the Lower Colorado River and in southern California; the Trincheras of Sonora, Mexico; the Mogollon culture in eastern Arizona; southwest New Mexico; northwest Chihuahua, Mexico; and the Ancestral Puebloans in northern Arizona. From 900 to 1150 CE, neighboring Chaco society encouraged trade throughout northern Arizona and into southwest Colorado and southern Utah. These trade networks increased hand-to-hand trade throughout the region, with goods traveling throughout the Colorado Plateau, northern Arizona, and the Phoenix area. Hohokam irrigation systems supported the largest population in the Southwest by 1300 CE. Archaeologists working at a major archaeological dig in the 1990s in the Tucson Basin, along the Santa Cruz River, identified a culture and people that may have been the ancestors of the Hohokam.2007-036 General COP Treatment Plan; Pueblo Grande Museum Project 2007‚Äì95; City of Phoenix Project No. ST87350010; p. 9 Cultural Context This prehistoric group may have occupied southern Arizona as early as 2000 BCE, and in the Early Agricultural Period grew corn, lived year-round in sedentary villages, and developed sophisticated irrigation canals. The Hohokam used the waters of the Salt and Gila Rivers to construct an assortment of simple canals, combined with weirs, in their various agricultural pursuits. From 800 to 1400 CE,Haury, Emil W Snaketown: 1964‚Äì1965, Kiva Vol. 31, No. 1. Maney Publishing on behalf of the Arizona Archaeological and Historical Society, Oct. 1965, p. 8. they used extensive irrigation networks that rivaled the complexity of those used in the ancient Near East, Egypt, and China. These were constructed using relatively simple excavation tools, without the benefit of advanced engineering technologies, and achieved drops of a few feet per mile, balancing erosion and siltation. Over 70 years of archaeological research has revealed that the Hohokam cultivated varieties of cotton, tobacco, maize, beans, and squash, as well as harvested a vast assortment of wild plants. Late in the Hohokam Chronological Sequence, they also used extensive dry-farming systems, primarily to grow agave for food and fiber. Their reliance on agricultural strategies was vital in their less than hospitable desert environment, and these would provide the basis for the aggregation of rural populations into complex urban centers. Overall, Hohokam villages and smaller settlements can be classified within the rancher√≠a-tradition. Rancheria are typically found near water, located on arable land, and residential areas that are clustered together. These clustered residential areas are what archaeologists call compounds. Related nuclear families would build their homes very close or joined together, surrounding a central, outdoor courtyard. The courtyard was an area designated for cooking, gathering, and other tasks, since chores were often shared among the compound residents. Many features of earlier Hohokam domestic architecture, such as squared or rectangular pithouses, seem to have been transplanted relatively intact from the Tucson basin during the early Formative Period. Throughout the Hohokam Chronological Sequence, individual residential structures were normally excavated approximately below ground level, with plastered or compacted floors that covered between 12 and 35 m2, and featured a circular, bowl-shaped, clay-lined hearth situated near the wall-entry. By 600 CE, a distinct Hohokam architectural tradition emerged that had similarities with Mesoamerica, such as ballcourts that also served as neighborhood gathering and trade spaces. By 1150 CE, pithouses were replaced by above ground structures in the compound style with central courtyards. By 1200 CE, rectangular platforms mounds were being constructed. Hohokam burial practices varied over time, but cremation was a defining cultural characteristic of the Hohokam Core. Cremation has been used by archaeologists to suggest cultural interaction through trade, or even immigration, from the Hohokam Core into neighboring communities. An example is the Mogollan, at the Continental site in Tucson. Initially, the primary method employed was flexed inhumation, similar to the tradition used by the southern Mogollon culture, located immediately to the east. In the late Formative and Preclassic periods, the Hohokam cremated their dead, strikingly similar to the traditions documented among the historic Patayan culture situated to the west along the Lower Colorado River. Although the particulars of the practice changed somewhat, the Hohokam cremation tradition remained dominant until around 1300 CE.  Hohokam chronological sequence  As an archaeological construct, the Hohokam chronological sequence (HCS) uses a culture history-based period/phase scheme designed to provide a narrative of what has been perceived as a sequence of significant cultural change. Overall, the reason the HCS is confusing is that two primary methods of expressing this information are used, and within this context, a vast plethora of theoretical variants have been posited. Only the two primary schemes will be addressed, referred to as the Gladwinian and Cultural Horizon expressions. The latter is an adaptation of the chronological scheme used in Mesoamerica applied to avoid the interpretive bias inherent in the Gladwinian scheme (i.e. Pioneer, Colonial, Sedentary periods). The HCS and the methods used to establish its calendrical reference are applied only to the Hohokam Core Area, which is the Gila-Salt River basin associated with Phoenix, Arizona, as opposed to what has come to be known as the Hohokam Peripheries. The Hohokam Peripheries are regions located outside the core area. Within these regions, the basic period designations are retained; however, local phases are often used to note significant differences. The cause of these differences and the range of cultural variability within the Hohokam Culture will be addressed below; to some extent, it represents communities influenced by their Ancestral Puebloan and Mogollon neighbors. = Pioneer/Formative period (AD 1‚Äì750) = Hiking trail leading to Indian Mesa (in the background): The hiking trail is located on a portion of a canal which the Hohokam built in AD 700. The canal is now filled with soil.\\"Lake Pleasant (Images of America)\\", Author: Gerard Giordano; Page: 13; Arcadia Publishing; Living as farmers raising corn and beans, these early Hohokam founded a series of small villages along the middle Gila River. The communities were located near good, arable land, with dry farming common in the earlier years of this period. Water wells, usually less than deep, were dug for domestic water supplies. Early Hohokam homes were constructed of branches bent in a semicircular fashion and covered with twigs, reeds, and heavily applied mud and other items at hand. Crop, agricultural skill, and cultural refinements increased between AD 300 and 500 as the Hohokam acquired a new group of cultivated plants, presumably from trade with peoples in the area of modern Mexico. These new acquisitions included cotton, tepary bean, sieva and jack beans, cushaw and warty squash, and southwestern pigweed. Agave species had been gathered for food and fiber for thousands of years by southwestern peoples, but around 600, the Hohokam began cultivating agave, particularly Agave murpheyi (\\"Hohokam agave\\"), on large areas of rocky, dry ground. Agave became a major food source for the Hohokam to augment the food grown in irrigated areas.Fish, Suzanne K. \\"Hohokam Impacts on Sonoran Desert Environment\\" in Imperfect Balance: Landscape Transformations in the Precolumbian Americas. ed by David L. Lentz. New York: Columbia U Press, 2000, pp.251‚Äì280 Engineering improved access to river water and the inhabitants excavated canals for irrigation. Evidence of trade networks include turquoise, shells from the Gulf of California, and parrot bones from central Mexico. Seeds and grains were prepared on stone manos and metates. Ceramics appeared shortly before AD 300, with pots of unembellished brown used for storage and cooking, and as containers for cremated remains. Materials produced for ritual use included fired clay human and animal figures and incense burners. = Colonial/Preclassic period (750‚Äì1050/1150) = Sears-Kay Ruin Fort Mystery Room before circa 1050 AD: This room had rounded corners. Sears-Kay Ruin Fort rooms with square corners, circa 1050 AD Growth is the major characteristic of the Colonial period. Villages grew larger, with clusters of houses opening on a common courtyard. Some evidence exists of social stratification in larger homes and more ornate grave goods. Area and canal systems expanded, and tobacco and agave production began. Mexican influence increased. In larger communities, the first Hohokam ball courts were constructed and served as focal points for games and ceremonies. Pottery was embellished by the addition of an iron-stained slip, which produced a distinctive red-on-buff ware. Sedentary period/Sacaton phase (950‚Äì1050/1150) Further population increase brought significant changes during this period. Irrigation canals and structures became larger and required more maintenance. More land came under cultivation, and Southwestern pigweed was grown. House design evolved into post-reinforced pit-houses, covered with caliche adobe. Rancheria-like villages grew up around common courtyards, with evidence of increased communal activity. Large common ovens were used to cook bread and meats. Crafts were dramatically refined. By about AD 1000, the Hohokam are credited with being the first culture to master acid etching. Artisans produced jewelry from shell, stone, and bone, and began to carve stone figures. Cotton textile work flourished. Red-on-buff pottery was widely produced. This growth brought a need for increased organization, and perhaps authority. The regional culture spread widely, extending from near the Mexican border to the Verde River in the north. There appears to have been an elite class, as well as an increase in social stature for the craftsman. Platform mounds similar to those in central Mexico appear, and may be associated with an upper class and have some religious function. Trade items from the Mexican heartland included copper bells, mosaics, stone mirrors, and ornate birds such as macaws. = Classic period (AD 1050/1150‚Äì1450) = Hohokam turquoise mosaic jewelry This period can generally be considered a time of both growth and social change. The community of Snaketown, once central to the culture, was suddenly abandoned. Parts of this large village seem to have burned, and thereafter it was never reoccupied. This period also had the construction of large and prestigious structures in the Salt-Gila Basin. These included large, rectangular, adobe- walled compounds with platform mounds and great houses, such as the example found at the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument. Additionally, evidence of Hohokam influence in a broader context decreased significantly. Santan phase (AD 1050‚Äì1150) This phase was initially proposed as part of the Gladwinian scheme, but recently has fallen out of favor with many Hohokam archaeologists. The primary reason for this view is that the Hohokam buff ware type once classified as Santan red-on-buff is now listed as either a late form of Sacaton or Casa Grande red-on-buffs. The wide range of vessel forms used for decorated pottery was discarded for globular jars with necks, while overall a significant decrease in production and use of Hohokam buff wares occurred, as well as a radical decline in the procurement and trade of raw shell from northern Mexico and its manufacture into jewelry. Another trait of this phase was the transition from pithouses to pitrooms and the introduction of spherical spindle whorls similar to examples used in northern Mexico. Conceptually, this episode had the relatively sudden and widespread abandonment or relocation of many Hohokam villages and a short-lived population decline. Vast internal changes, the rejection of the Hohokam ballcourt system, and the peripheries' displaying overt indications of belligerence towards the core area, followed by their cultural realignment, suggests that this was a very important episode. Soho phase (AD 1050/1150‚Äì1300) The diagnostic ceramic type for this phase was Casa Grande red-on-buff. This Hohokam buff ware was characterized exclusively by jars with necks, decorated with a limited variety of geometric and textual designs. This pottery type appears to have been manufactured at several locales situated in the Gila River basin between Florence and Sacaton, Arizona. In general, this phase represents a major cultural retraction in terms of territory, and two significant episodes of reorganization. The first reorganization occurred around AD 1150 and was typified by a modest increase in population and near- universal adoption of pitroom architecture. These early pitrooms were built of perishable material covered with a thick adobe plaster, and the basal portion of the interior walls was often lined with upright slabs. Similar to the Preclassic period villages, these early Classic period habitation structures were clustered around open courtyards. These courtyard groups were clustered near a large central locus, which often included small platform mounds. These platform mounds were rectangular, faced by post-reinforced adobe walls, and were filled with either sterile soil or refuse from Preclassic trash mounds. In the largest villages, the central locus included small platform mounds. The number of small and medium-sized settlements seem to have declined as the larger communities became increasingly more densely occupied. Civano phase (AD 1300‚Äì1350/1375) Although Casa Grande red-on-buff continued to be produced, the pottery type that characterized this phase was Salado polychrome, primarily Gila polychrome. This ceramic type was either manufactured locally or procured as a trade ware. This phase also had the introduction the comal, similar to examples found in northern Mexico, and the production of bird-shaped effigy vessels. Examples of exotic stone and shell artifacts associated with high-status individuals ‚Äì such as nose plugs, pendants, ear rings, bracelets, necklaces, and sophisticated shell inlays ‚Äì indicate that the design and manufacture of jewelry reached its zenith during this phase. Other important developments were the significant increased procurement and manufacture of red ware, and the near-universal use of inhumation burial in the area north of the Gila River, both similar to the practices and traditions used by the historic O'odham. Immediately after AD 1300, Hohokam villages were reorganized along the lines experienced in the Lower Verde, Tonto Basin, and Safford Basin, in the 13th century. These compounds were composed of a large, rectangular exterior wall that either completely or more typically partially enclosed a series of contiguous courtyards and plazas delineated by interior partition walls. In turn, each courtyard may have contained one to as many as four large, rectangular, adobe- walled pitrooms, possibly associated with several utility structures. Overall, these communities were characterized by relatively compact clusters of between five and 25 adobe-walled compounds, which tended to be grouped around a single very large and well-built compound that often had some form of large community structure, such as a platform mound or great house. Great house structures, as with the one preserved at Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, were built only at the largest communities. These stone or adobe buildings had up to four stories, and were probably used by the managerial or religious elites. They may have also been constructed to align with astronomical observations. Trade with Mexico appears to have declined, but an increased number of trade goods arrived from Pueblo peoples in the north and the east. Between AD 1350 and 1375, the Hohokam tradition lost vitality and stability, and many of the largest settlements were abandoned. Rapidly changing climatic conditions apparently substantially affected the Hohokam agricultural base and subsequently prevented the cohesion of their large communities. Repeated floods in the middle 14th century significantly deepened the Salt River bed while destroying canal heads, which required their continuous extension upstream. Soon, additional flooding removed irreplaceable segments of these extensions, which effectively rendered hundreds of miles of canals virtually useless. Because of differences in hydrology and geomorphology, these processes had a lesser impact on the irrigation systems used by the Hohokam in the Gila River basin, yet these were abandoned, as well. However, the population decline of the Hohokam is estimated to be much less dramatic than formerly believed, at a peak of 20 per 1,000 people between AD 1350 and 1400, and is overestimated simply because Hohokam split into smaller, harder to identify groups. This is further supported by analyzing populations of prey animals that would have been hunted in the area during this period, and finding no major changes in their population, and thus, the number of people hunting them. Polvoron phase (AD 1350/1375‚Äì1450) This phase is characterized by the widespread use and manufacture of Salado polychrome, with both Gila and Tonto polychromes. After AD 1375, the Hohokam abandoned the villages and canal systems within the lower Salt River basin. This area continued to be occupied, albeit on a far smaller scale. Meanwhile, the very few villages that remained were quite small, and were concentrated along the Gila River, with the notable exception of the lower Queen Creek drainage. Conceptually, this episode is extremely relevant and of great historic importance, as it represents the immediate aftermath of the Hohokam cultural collapse. It represents a critical stage in the ethnogenesis of the modern O'odham.  Ceramic tradition  Hohokam pottery from Casa Grande The earliest sedentary agricultural settlements in central Arizona date from 1000 to 500 BCE, yet the first ceramics appear just before the Hohokam rise in 300 CE. Some archaeologists interpret the sudden appearance of pottery as new trade or immigration into the Phoenix area, resulting in the rise of the Hohokam. Other archaeologists classify many of the defining, cultural characteristics as already within the indigenous farming communities by Hohokam rise. Hence, pottery helps to fuel the controversy over Hohokam origins. It was once thought that Hohokam pottery material varied by location, since communities used local resources. Recently, studies on the temper revealed a variety of origins where pottery was manufactured and traded. Several different pallettes, from different time periods, were found in the Gila Bend Region. This helps support the fact that the Hohokam stayed in one area for a long period of time. Hohokam ceramics are defined by a distinct Plain, Red, and Decorated buffware tradition, and were made using a technique called coiling. Aa small, fine clay base was connected to a series of coils. These coils were then thinned and shaped using the paddle and anvil technique. Hohokam Plain and Red wares were primarily tempered with a variety of materials including micaceous, phyllite, or Squaw Peak schist, as well as granite, quartz, quartzite, and arkosic sands. Analytically, based on the type of temper used, these are classified as to the geographic setting of their manufacture, and are referred to as Gila (Gila River basin), Wingfield (Agua Fria basin, the Northern Periphery, or Lower Verde area), Piestewa Peak (Phoenix metro area north of the Salt River), South Mountain (Phoenix metro area south of the Salt River), or Salt (Salt or Verde River basins) Plain and Red wares. The surfaces of Plain wares were smoothed to some extent and many were polished, or slipped, with other minerals or clays. After the vessels were fired, these sometimes turned a color that ranged from light or dark brown, gray, to orange. Later, the interiors of bowls were slipped with a black carbonous material. Hohokam Red wares were slipped with an iron-based pigment that turned red after the vessel was fired. The manufacture of decorated Hohokam pottery was similar to that of the Plain wares. However, the clays tended to be of a finer quality and were tempered with caliche and limited amounts of very finely ground micaceous schist and small particles of vegetative material.  Cultural divisions  Cultural labels such as Hohokam, Ancient Pueblo (Anasazi), Mogollon, or Patayan are used by archaeologists to define cultural differences among prehistoric peoples. Culture names and divisions have been assigned by individuals separated from the cultures by both time and space. Cultural divisions are by nature arbitrary, and are based solely on data available at the time of scholarly analysis and publication. They are subject to change, not only on the basis of new information and discoveries, but also as attitudes and perspectives change within the scientific community. An archaeological division cannot be assumed to correspond to a particular language group or to a political entity such as a \\"tribe\\". When making use of modern cultural divisions in the Southwest, three specific limitations in the current conventions exist: * Archaeological research focuses on physical remains, the items left behind during people's activities. Scientists are able to examine fragments of pottery vessels, human remains, stone tools. or evidence left from the construction of buildings, but many other aspects of the cultures of prehistoric peoples are not tangible. Languages spoken by these people and their beliefs and behavior are difficult to decipher from the physical materials. Cultural divisions are tools of the modern scientist, so should not be considered similar to divisions or relationships the ancient residents may have recognized. Modern cultures in this region, many of whom claim some of these ancient people as ancestors, contain a striking range of diversity in lifestyle, language, and religious belief. This suggests the ancient people were also more diverse than their material remains may suggest. * The modern term \\"style\\" has a bearing on how material items such as pottery or architecture can be interpreted. Within a people, different ways to accomplish the same goal can be adopted by subsets of the larger group. For example, in modern Western cultures, alternative styles of clothing characterize older and younger generations. Some cultural differences may be based on linear traditions, on teaching from one generation or \\"school\\" to another. Varieties in style may define arbitrary groups within a culture, perhaps identifying social status, gender, clan or guild affiliation, religious belief, or cultural alliances. Variations may also simply reflect the different resources available in given time or area. * Designating culture groups, such as the Hohokam, tends to create an image of group territories separated by clear-cut boundaries, like modern nation states. These simply did not exist. \\"Prehistoric people traded, worshipped, and collaborated most often with other nearby groups. Cultural differences should therefore be understood as 'clinal', 'increasing gradually as the distance separating groups also increases.(Plog, p. 72) Departures from the expected pattern may occur because of unidentifiable social or political situations or because of geographical barriers. In the Southwest, mountain ranges, rivers, and most obviously, the Grand Canyon, can be significant geographic barriers for human communities, likely reducing the frequency of contact with other groups. Current opinion holds that the closer cultural similarity between the Mogollon and Anasazi and their greater differences from the Hohokam culture is due to both the geography and the variety of climate zones in the Southwest.  Major core area villages  The true measure of the Hohokam can only be derived from the sum of their material culture. This is best gleaned from a review of their principal population centers, or more appropriately, major villages. Although sharing a common cultural expression, each of these major villages has its own unique history of emergence, growth, and eventual abandonment. Including outlines of archaeological exploration, provided below are brief descriptions of the largest and most important prehistoric villages found within the so- called Hohokam core area. =Snaketown= Snaketown was the archetypical Preclassic period settlement and preeminent community centered within the core of the Hohokam culture area. Today, Snaketown is situated within the Hohokam Pima National Monument, located near Santan, Arizona, which was authorized by Congress on October 21, 1972. Excavations conducted in the 1930s and again in the 1960s revealed that the site was inhabited from about 300 BC to AD 1050. At its height in the early 11th century, Snaketown was the center of both the Hohokam culture and the production of the distinctive Hohokam buff ware. Following the last excavations conducted by Emil Haury, the site was completely recovered with earth, leaving nothing visible above ground. Overall, Snaketown boasted two ball courts, numerous trash mounds, a small ceremonial mound, a large central plaza, several large community houses, and hundreds of residential pithouses, and may have been home to at least several thousand people. After Snaketown was abandoned, several minor settlements were founded within the general vicinity and continued to be occupied until the early 14th century AD. The Hohokam Pima National Monument is located on Gila River Indian Community (GRIC) land and is under tribal ownership. It covers nearly (6.9 km¬≤). The GRIC has decided not to open this extremely sensitive prehistoric site to the public. =Grewe-Casa Grande= The distinctively modern-looking roof was built in 1932, to protect the Great House or Casa Grande, at the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument. Altogether, the greater Grewe-Casa Grande Site represented the largest Hohokam community located within the middle Gila River valley. Situated between two primary canals (on the north, Canal Casa Grande and to the south Canal Coolidge), over time, this community was recorded as several separate archaeological sites. These include the Casa Grande, Grewe, Vahki Inn Village, and Horvath sites. Occupied in the Preclassic and Classic periods, each of these sites was composed of between two and 20 large residential areas. Overall, the greater Grewe-Casa Grande archaeological site covered about , centered on State Route 87 and immediately north of the modern city of Coolidge, Arizona. Most observers are attracted to the four-story great house found near the center of the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument. Akimel O'odham oral tradition records that prior to the arrival of the Sto'am O'odham, or \\"Coyote People\\", this massive structure was built by an important personage called Sial Teu-utak Sivan, (Morning-Green Leader) or \\"Chief Turquoise\\". In the O'odham language, the great house and the associated prehistoric ruins found north of Coolidge were collectively referred to as Sivan Vah'Ki, literally meaning the \\"Abandoned House\\", or \\"Village of the Ruler\\", respectively. As Frank Russell recorded in the early 20th century, several O'odham oral traditions note that Sial Teu-utak was an important leader of the Casa Grande community, before the overthrow of the Suwu'Ki O'odham, or \\"Vulture People\\". Eusebio Francesco Chini (Father Kino) arrived in the middle Gila River valley in 1694 to find the monumental great house abandoned and already in a state of decay and decomposition. Despite its condition, later Jesuit missionaries and he used the great house to hold Mass, between the late 17th and 18th centuries. Adolph Bandelier provided one of the first detailed archaeological maps and descriptions of Classic period architecture at the central locus, or Compound A, of the Casa Grande site, in 1884. Jesse Walter Fewkes and Cosmos Mindeleff made further descriptions of this area. Between 1906 and 1912, Fewkes conducted excavations and stabilization of this portion of the site. In 1927, Harold Gladwin excavated stratified tests of several trash mounds at both the Grewe and Casa Grande sites. He also defined and excavated portions of Sacaton 9:6 (GP), an adobe- walled compound situated on the extreme edge of the Casa Grande site, east of State Route 87, near the current entrance to the monument. Relatively large- scale excavations were carried out between 1930 and 1931, by Van Bergen-Los Angeles Museum Expedition under the direction of Arthur Woodward and Irwin Hayden. This project concentrated on a parcel at the Grewe site, and Compound F located within the northeast corner of the Casa Grande National Monument. Overall, including the recovery of 172 burials and hundreds of thousands of artifacts, about 60 pithouses, numerous pits, 27 adobe pitrooms, and a ballcourt were excavated or tested during the course of this project. Additional excavations were performed in the southeast corner of the monument by the Civil Works Administration directed by Russell Hastings in 1933 and 1934. The excavation of 15 pithouses, three pits, 32 burials, and portions of four trash mounds demonstrated the presence of significantly large late Preclassic and early Classic period components within the area covered by the monument. Yet, by far the largest and most comprehensive archaeological endeavor was conducted by Northland Research Inc., from 1995 to 1997, on a parcel within portions of the Casa Grande, Grewe, and Horvath sites that paralleled State Routes 87 and 287. This project was directed by Douglass Craig, and resulted in the identification and/or excavation of 247 pithouses, 24 pitrooms, 866 pits, 11 canal alignments, a ballcourt, and portions of four adobe-walled compounds, as well as the recovery of 158 burials and over 400,000 artifacts. Based on the results of these projects, the history of the greater Grewe-Casa Grande site can be reconstructed with at least some degree of precision. The genesis of this important village appears to have been associated with several groups of pithouses organized around a series of relatively small, circular plazas. These appear to date to the sixth century AD and were located along and immediately upslope of the Coolidge Canal system. By the eighth century AD, this dispersed hamlet had expanded nearly a kilometer south and developed into a full-fledged village. At this point, the settlement consisted of densely packed yet discrete groups of pithouses clustered around small open courtyards. In turn these structures delineated a large central plaza. Adjoining the plaza was a medium-sized ballcourt, and overall, the village was affiliated with several smaller outlying settlements. In the 10th century, at least two large secondary villages and about a dozen new hamlets were founded to the west of the main settlement. With the abandonment of Snaketown and the transition from the Preclassic to Classic periods, the greater Grewe-Casa Grande community became one of the largest and most important Hohokam population centers. At its height, the Grewe-Casa Grande village boosted about 100 trash mounds, several hundred residential pithouses, and four or five ballcourts. Regardless of its size, complexity, and significance along the middle Gila River, this settlement never seemed to have attained the status enjoyed by Snaketown, as it pertained to the Hohokam culture, per se. As the western portion of this settlement grew, large sections of the eastern half declined and were abandoned. By AD 1300, the village was composed of about 19 adobe-walled residential compounds, several pitroom clusters, a platform mound, a great house, and numerous trash mounds. With most of the village contained within what is now the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, after the middle of the 14th century, it began a rapid decline. Around AD 1400 or 1450, the entire settlement was abandoned, except for a low-scale occupation associated with the Polvoron phase. Today, about 60% of the Grewe-Casa Grande site has been either destroyed due to agricultural and commercial development, excavated, or remains relatively intact buried under fields used to grow cotton. About 40% of this once huge settlement can be found within the Casa Grande Ruins National Monument, which was established as the nation's first archeological reserve in 1892, and declared a national monument in 1918. Visitors can enjoy an interpretative center, walk among the stabilized ruins of Compound A, and closely view the great house, which has been protected since 1932 from the elements by a distinctively modern-looking roof. =Pueblo Grande= Pueblo Grande Museum Archeological Park near central Phoenix contains preserved ruins and artifact exhibits. Archaeological finds have been recorded along the track of the adjacent Valley Metro light-rail construction. football field and is 27 feet high. =Mesa Grande= The Mesa Grande ruin, located in Mesa, Arizona, represents another large Hohokam village that was occupied both in the Preclassic and Classic periods, from around AD 200 to 1450. Although this settlement appears to have been very important, it has had little archaeological work, other than the mapping and stabilization projects conducted by the Southwest Archaeology Team (SWAT). The SWAT's indispensable volunteer work at the Mesa Grande ruin began in the middle 1990s and continues today. At its peak in the late Preclassic and early Classic periods, this settlement may have consisted of as many as 20 discrete residential areas and covered several hundred acres. Today, due to massive urban development, the surface remains of the village have been reduced to a 6.4 acre parcel situated immediately west of the old Mesa Hospital. Within this plot are the ruins of a large adobe compound and a nine-meters-high, relatively intact, platform mound. This is only one of the last three remaining Hohokam platform mounds in the greater Phoenix metro area. This parcel was transferred into public ownership in the mid-1980s, therefore the compound and mound were not destroyed and a full visitor center exists on the enclosed site that is open October‚ÄìMay annually. =Las Colinas and Los Hornos= Located within the modern city of Tempe, Arizona, the Hohokam settlement of Los Hornos (from the Spanish los hornos, meaning 'the ovens') was initially investigated by Frank Cushing in 1887. With urban expansion, additional excavations were conducted in the 1970s, late 1980s, and throughout the 1990s. The results of these comprehensive archaeological projects have documented both a large Preclassic- and Classic-period village organized much the same as Snaketown and Pueblo Grande, respectively, yet on a somewhat smaller scale. Los Hornos appears to have started around AD 400, as a small cluster of rectangular pithouses situated on the extreme western edge of the site, west of Priest Dr and south of US 60. Over time, the Los Hornos settlement expanded along a series of large secondary canals to the east and southeast. At the height of the Preclassic occupation in the Sacaton phase, which was contemporary with the zenith of Snaketown, this settlement had one large ball court, a large central plaza, several formal cremation cemeteries, numerous trash mounds, and several hundred residential pithouses. The detailed excavation of 50 Preclassic period pithouses in the area located immediately south of US 60 and east of Priest Dr, provided invaluable information concerning residential architecture and the functional use of interior space. Additional information concerning the Archaeological Consulting Services Ltd. excavation of a Preclassic occupation at Los Hornos can be found at the following site. After a short period of population loss and community reorganization in the late 11th and early 12th centuries AD, Los Hornos continued to shift east and south in the Classic period. This large village appears to have recovered somewhat and again became an important settlement late in the Soho or early in the Civano phases, from AD 1277 to 1325. At this time, Los Hornos, now centered on Hardy Dr south of US 60 and north of Baseline Road, consisted of about 15 residential compounds, a large central plaza, a large rectangular platform mound with an associated compound, several large trash mounds, and numerous borrow pits and inhumation and cremation cemeteries. Prior to the middle of the 14th century AD, with the rise of Los Muertos located several miles to the southeast, the Los Hornos community appears to have spiraled into a precipitous decline. Although greatly reduced in scale and importance, the settlement continued to be occupied until it was effectively abandoned between AD 1400 and 1450, as was much of the Lower Salt River basin. Today, much of the Los Hornos village has been destroyed due to modern transportation, residential, and commercial development, or has been excavated. The only surface vestiges of this once significant Hohokam settlement are the remains of several low trash mounds found in the Old Guadalupe Village Cemetery.

She published seven autobiographies, three books of essays, several books of poetry, and is credited with a list of plays, movies, and television shows spanning over 50 years. She received dozens of awards and more than 50 honorary degrees. Angelou is best known for her series of seven autobiographies, which focus on her childhood and early adult experiences. The first, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969), tells of her life up to the age of 17 and brought her international recognition and acclaim. She became a poet and writer after a string of odd jobs during her young adulthood. These included fry cook, sex worker, nightclub performer, Porgy and Bess cast member, Southern Christian Leadership Conference coordinator, and correspondent in Egypt and Ghana during the decolonization of Africa. She was also an actress, writer, director, and producer of plays, movies, and public television programs. In 1982, she was named the first Reynolds Professor of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. She was active in the Civil Rights Movement and worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Beginning in the 1990s, she made approximately 80 appearances a year on the lecture circuit, something she continued into her eighties. In 1993, Angelou recited her poem \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" (1993) at the first inauguration of Bill Clinton, making her the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at the inauguration of John F. Kennedy in 1961. With the publication of I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou publicly discussed aspects of her personal life. She was respected as a spokesperson for black people and women, and her works have been considered a defense of black culture. Her works are widely used in schools and universities worldwide, although attempts have been made to ban her books from some U.S. libraries. Angelou's most celebrated works have been labeled as autobiographical fiction, but many critics consider them to be autobiographies. She made a deliberate attempt to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing and expanding the genre. Her books center on themes such as racism, identity, family and travel. Early life Marguerite Annie Johnson was born in St. Louis, Missouri, on April 4, 1928, the second child of Bailey Johnson, a doorman and navy dietitian, and Vivian (Baxter) Johnson, a nurse and card dealer.Lupton, p. 4. Angelou's older brother, Bailey Jr., nicknamed Marguerite \\"Maya\\", derived from \\"My\\" or \\"Mya Sister\\".Angelou (1969), p. 67. When Angelou was three and her brother four, their parents' \\"calamitous marriage\\"Angelou (1969), p. 6. ended, and their father sent them to Stamps, Arkansas, alone by train, to live with their paternal grandmother, Annie Henderson. In \\"an astonishing exception\\" to the harsh economics of African Americans of the time, Angelou's grandmother prospered financially during the Great Depression and World War II because the general store she owned sold needed basic commodities and because \\"she made wise and honest investments\\". Four years later, when Angelou was seven and her brother eight, the children's father \\"came to Stamps without warning\\"Angelou (1969), p. 52. and returned them to their mother's care in St. Louis. At the age of eight, while living with her mother, Angelou was sexually abused and raped by her mother's boyfriend, a man named Freeman. She told her brother, who told the rest of their family. Freeman was found guilty but was jailed for only one day. Four days after his release, he was murdered, probably by Angelou's uncles. Angelou became mute for almost five years,Lupton, p. 5. believing, as she stated, \\"I thought, my voice killed him; I killed that man, because I told his name. And then I thought I would never speak again, because my voice would kill anyone.\\" According to Marcia Ann Gillespie and her colleagues, who wrote a biography about Angelou, it was during this period of silence when Angelou developed her extraordinary memory, her love for books and literature, and her ability to listen and observe the world around her.Gillespie et al., p. 22. Shortly after Freeman's murder, when Angelou was eight and her brother nine, Angelou and her brother were sent back to their grandmother.Gillespie et al., pp. 21‚Äì22. Angelou credits a teacher and friend of her family, Mrs. Bertha Flowers, with helping her speak again. Flowers introduced her to authors such as Charles Dickens, William Shakespeare, Edgar Allan Poe, Georgia Douglas Johnson, and James Weldon Johnson, authors who would affect her life and career, as well as black female artists like Frances Harper, Anne Spencer, and Jessie Fauset.Angelou (1969), p. 13.Gillespie et al., p. 23.Lupton, p. 15. When Angelou was fourteen and her brother fifteen, she and her brother moved in with their mother once again, who had since moved to Oakland, California. During World War II, Angelou attended the California Labor School. At the age of 16, she became the first black female cable car conductor in San Francisco.Gillespie et al., p. 28. She wanted the job badly, admiring the uniforms of the operators ‚Äî so much so that her mother referred to it as her \\"dream job.\\" Her mother encouraged her to pursue the position, but warned her that she would need to arrive early and work harder than others. In 2014, Angelou received a lifetime achievement award from the Conference of Minority Transportation Officials as part of a session billed ‚ÄúWomen Who Move the Nation.‚Äù Three weeks after completing school, at the age of seventeen, she gave birth to her son, Clyde (who later changed his name to Guy Johnson).Angelou (1969), p. 279. Career = Adulthood and early career: 1951‚Äì61 = In 1951, Angelou married Tosh Angelos, a Greek electrician, former sailor, and aspiring musician, despite the condemnation of interracial relationships at the time and the disapproval of her mother.Hagen, p. xvi.Gillespie et al., pp. 29, 31. She took modern dance classes during this time, and met dancers and choreographers Alvin Ailey and Ruth Beckford. Ailey and Angelou formed a dance team, calling themselves \\"Al and Rita\\", and performed modern dance at fraternal black organizations throughout San Francisco but never became successful.Angelou (1993), p. 95. Angelou, her new husband, and her son moved to New York City so she could study African dance with Trinidadian dancer Pearl Primus, but they returned to San Francisco a year later.Gillespie et al., pp. 36‚Äì37. After Angelou's marriage ended in 1954, she danced professionally in clubs around San Francisco, including the nightclub The Purple Onion, where she sang and danced to calypso music.Gillespie et al., p. 38. Up to that point, she went by the name of \\"Marguerite Johnson\\", or \\"Rita\\", but at the strong suggestion of her managers and supporters at The Purple Onion, she changed her professional name to \\"Maya Angelou\\" (her nickname and former married surname). It was a \\"distinctive name\\"Gillespie et al., p. 41. that set her apart and captured the feel of her calypso dance performances. During 1954 and 1955, Angelou toured Europe with a production of the opera Porgy and Bess. She began her practice of learning the language of every country she visited, and in a few years she gained proficiency in several languages.Hagen, pp. 91‚Äì92. In 1957, riding on the popularity of calypso, Angelou recorded her first album, Miss Calypso, which was reissued as a CD in 1996.Gillespie et al., p. 48. She appeared in an off- Broadway review that inspired the 1957 film Calypso Heat Wave, in which Angelou sang and performed her own compositions. Angelou met novelist John Oliver Killens in 1959 and, at his urging, moved to New York to concentrate on her writing career. She joined the Harlem Writers Guild, where she met several major African-American authors, including John Henrik Clarke, Rosa Guy, Paule Marshall, and Julian Mayfield, and was published for the first time.Gillespie et al., pp. 49‚Äì51. In 1960, after meeting civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. and hearing him speak, she and Killens organized \\"the legendary\\" Cabaret for Freedom to benefit the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and she was named SCLC's Northern Coordinator. According to scholar Lyman B. Hagen, her contributions to civil rights as a fundraiser and SCLC organizer were successful and \\"eminently effective\\".Hagen, p. 103. Angelou also began her pro-Castro and anti-apartheid activism during this time.Gillespie et al., p. 57. = Africa to Caged Bird: 1961‚Äì69 = Most of Angelou's time in Africa was spent in alt=View of Accra, Ghana from above. In 1961, Angelou performed in Jean Genet's play The Blacks, along with Abbey Lincoln, Roscoe Lee Brown, James Earl Jones, Louis Gossett, Godfrey Cambridge, and Cicely Tyson.Gillespie et al., p. 64. Also in 1961, she met South African freedom fighter Vusumzi Make; they never officially married.Gillespie et al., p. 59. She and her son Guy moved with Make to Cairo, where Angelou worked as an associate editor at the weekly English-language newspaper The Arab Observer.Gillespie et al., p. 65.Gillespie et al., p. 71. In 1962, her relationship with Make ended, and she and Guy moved to Accra, Ghana so he could attend college, but he was seriously injured in an automobile accident. Angelou remained in Accra for his recovery and ended up staying there until 1965. She became an administrator at the University of Ghana, and was active in the African-American expatriate community.Gillespie et al., pp. 74, 75. She was a feature editor for The African Review,Braxton, p. 3. a freelance writer for the Ghanaian Times, wrote and broadcast for Radio Ghana, and worked and performed for Ghana's National Theatre. She performed in a revival of The Blacks in Geneva and Berlin.Gillespie et al., pp. 79‚Äì80. In Accra, she became close friends with Malcolm X during his visit in the early 1960s. Angelou returned to the U.S. in 1965 to help him build a new civil rights organization, the Organization of Afro-American Unity; he was assassinated shortly afterward. Devastated and adrift, she joined her brother in Hawaii, where she resumed her singing career. She moved back to Los Angeles to focus on her writing career. Working as a market researcher in Watts, Angelou witnessed the riots in the summer of 1965. She acted in and wrote plays, and returned to New York in 1967. She met her lifelong friend Rosa Guy and renewed her friendship with James Baldwin, whom she had met in Paris in the 1950s and called \\"my brother\\", during this time. Her friend Jerry Purcell provided Angelou with a stipend to support her writing.Gillespie et al., pp. 85‚Äì96. In 1968, Martin Luther King Jr. asked Angelou to organize a march. She agreed, but \\"postpones again\\", and in what Gillespie calls \\"a macabre twist of fate\\",Gillespie et al., p. 98. he was assassinated on her 40th birthday (April 4). Devastated again, she was encouraged out of her depression by her friend James Baldwin. As Gillespie states, \\"If 1968 was a year of great pain, loss, and sadness, it was also the year when America first witnessed the breadth and depth of Maya Angelou's spirit and creative genius\\". Despite having almost no experience, she wrote, produced, and narrated Blacks, Blues, Black!,All 10 episodes of Blacks, Blues, Black! can be viewed online Bay Area Television Archive, diva.sfsu.edu, accessed December 23, 2019 a ten-part series of documentaries about the connection between blues music and black Americans' African heritage, and what Angelou called the \\"Africanisms still current in the U.S.\\" for National Educational Television, the precursor of PBS. Also in 1968, inspired at a dinner party she attended with Baldwin, cartoonist Jules Feiffer, and his wife Judy, and challenged by Random House editor Robert Loomis, she wrote her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, published in 1969. This brought her international recognition and acclaim. = Later career = Released in 1972, Angelou's Georgia, Georgia, produced by a Swedish film company and filmed in Sweden, was the first screenplay written by a black woman. She also wrote the film's soundtrack, despite having very little additional input in the filming of the movie.Gillespie et al., p. 105. Angelou married Paul du Feu, a Welsh carpenter and ex-husband of writer Germaine Greer, in San Francisco in 1973. Over the next ten years, as Gillespie has stated, \\"She [Angelou] had accomplished more than many artists hope to achieve in a lifetime.\\"Gillespie et al., p. 119. Angelou worked as a composer, writing for singer Roberta Flack, and composing movie scores. She wrote articles, short stories, TV scripts, documentaries, autobiographies, and poetry. She produced plays and was named visiting professor at several colleges and universities. She was \\"a reluctant actor\\",Gillespie et al., p. 110. and was nominated for a Tony Award in 1973 for her role in Look Away. As a theater director, in 1988 she undertook a revival of Errol John's play Moon on a Rainbow Shawl at the Almeida Theatre in London. In 1977, Angelou appeared in a supporting role in the television mini-series Roots. She was given a multitude of awards during this period, including more than thirty honorary degrees from colleges and universities from all over the world. In the late 1970s, Angelou met Oprah Winfrey when Winfrey was a TV anchor in Baltimore, Maryland; Angelou would later become Winfrey's close friend and mentor. In 1981, Angelou and du Feu divorced. She returned to the southern United States in 1981 because she felt she had to come to terms with her past there and, despite having no bachelor's degree, accepted the lifetime Reynolds Professorship of American Studies at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, where she was one of a few full-time African-American professors. From that point on, she considered herself \\"a teacher who writes\\". Angelou taught a variety of subjects that reflected her interests, including philosophy, ethics, theology, science, theater, and writing.Gillespie et al., p. 126. The Winston-Salem Journal reported that even though she made many friends on campus, \\"she never quite lived down all of the criticism from people who thought she was more of a celebrity than an intellect...[and] an overpaid figurehead\\". The last course she taught at Wake Forest was in 2011, but she was planning to teach another course in late 2014. Her final speaking engagement at the university was in late 2013. Beginning in the 1990s, Angelou actively participated in the lecture circuit in a customized tour bus, something she continued into her eighties.Gillespie et al., p. 9. Maya Angelou speaking at a rally for Barack Obama, 2008 In 1993, Angelou recited her poem \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" at the presidential inauguration of Bill Clinton, becoming the first poet to make an inaugural recitation since Robert Frost at John F. Kennedy's inauguration in 1961. Her recitation resulted in more fame and recognition for her previous works, and broadened her appeal \\"across racial, economic, and educational boundaries\\". The recording of the poem won a Grammy Award.Gillespie et al., p. 142. In June 1995, she delivered what Richard Long called her \\"second 'public' poem\\",Long, p. 84. entitled \\"A Brave and Startling Truth\\", which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the United Nations. Angelou achieved her goal of directing a feature film in 1996, Down in the Delta, which featured actors such as Alfre Woodard and Wesley Snipes.Gillespie et al., p. 144. Also in 1996, she collaborated with R&B; artists Ashford & Simpson on seven of the eleven tracks of their album Been Found. The album was responsible for three of Angelou's only Billboard chart appearances. In 2000, she created a successful collection of products for Hallmark, including greeting cards and decorative household items.Gillespie et al., p. 10. She responded to critics who charged her with being too commercial by stating that \\"the enterprise was perfectly in keeping with her role as 'the people's poet'\\". More than thirty years after Angelou began writing her life story, she completed her sixth autobiography A Song Flung Up to Heaven, in 2002.Gillespie et al., p. 175. Angelou and Hillary Clinton at an event in North Carolina in 2008 Angelou campaigned for the Democratic Party in the 2008 presidential primaries, giving her public support to Hillary Clinton. In the run-up to the January Democratic primary in South Carolina, the Clinton campaign ran ads featuring Angelou's endorsement. The ads were part of the campaign's efforts to rally support in the Black community; but Barack Obama won the South Carolina primary, finishing 29 points ahead of Clinton and taking 80% of the Black vote. When Clinton's campaign ended, Angelou put her support behind Obama, who went on to win the presidential election and became the first African-American president of the United States. After Obama's inauguration, she stated, \\"We are growing up beyond the idiocies of racism and sexism.\\" In late 2010, Angelou donated her personal papers and career memorabilia to the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture in Harlem. They consisted of more than 340 boxes of documents that featured her handwritten notes on yellow legal pads for I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, a 1982 telegram from Coretta Scott King, fan mail, and personal and professional correspondence from colleagues such as her editor Robert Loomis. In 2011, Angelou served as a consultant for the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial in Washington, D.C. She spoke out in opposition to a paraphrase of a quotation by King that appeared on the memorial, saying, \\"The quote makes Dr. Martin Luther King look like an arrogant twit\\", and demanded that it be changed. Eventually, the paraphrase was removed. In 2013, at the age of 85, Angelou published the seventh volume of autobiography in her series, entitled Mom & Me & Mom, which focuses on her relationship with her mother. Personal life Evidence suggests that Angelou was partially descended from the Mende people of West Africa. In 2008, a DNA test revealed that among all of her African ancestors, 45 percent were from the Congo-Angola region and 55 percent were from West Africa. A 2008 PBS documentary found that Angelou's maternal great-grandmother Mary Lee, who had been emancipated after the Civil War, became pregnant by her white former owner, John Savin. Savin forced Lee to sign a false statement accusing another man of being the father of her child. After Savin was indicted for forcing Lee to commit perjury, and despite the discovery that Savin was the father, a jury found him not guilty. Lee was sent to the Clinton County poorhouse in Missouri with her daughter, Marguerite Baxter, who became Angelou's grandmother. Angelou described Lee as \\"that poor little Black girl, physically and mentally bruised\\". The details of Angelou's life described in her seven autobiographies and in numerous interviews, speeches, and articles tended to be inconsistent. Critic Mary Jane Lupton has explained that when Angelou spoke about her life, she did so eloquently but informally and \\"with no time chart in front of her\\".Lupton, p. 2. For example, she was married at least twice, but never clarified the number of times she had been married, \\"for fear of sounding frivolous\\"; according to her autobiographies and to Gillespie, she married Tosh Angelos in 1951 and Paul du Feu in 1974, and began her relationship with Vusumzi Make in 1961, but never formally married him. Angelou held many jobs, including some in the sex trade, working as a prostitute and madam for lesbians, as she described in her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name. In a 1995 interview, Angelou said, Angelou had one son, Guy, whose birth she described in her first autobiography; one grandson, two great-grandchildren,Gillespie et al., p. 156. and, according to Gillespie, a large group of friends and extended family. Angelou's mother Vivian Baxter died in 1991 and her brother Bailey Johnson Jr., died in 2000 after a series of strokes; both were important figures in her life and her books.Gillespie et al., p. 155. In 1981, the mother of her grandson disappeared with him; finding him took four years. In 2009, the gossip website TMZ erroneously reported that Angelou had been hospitalized in Los Angeles when she was alive and well in St. Louis, which resulted in rumors of her death and, according to Angelou, concern among her friends and family worldwide. In 2013, Angelou told her friend Oprah Winfrey that she had studied courses offered by the Unity Church, which were spiritually significant to her. She did not earn a university degree, but according to Gillespie it was Angelou's preference to be called \\"Dr. Angelou\\" by people outside of her family and close friends. She owned two homes in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and a \\"lordly brownstone\\" in Harlem, which was purchased in 2004 and was full of her \\"growing library\\"Gillespie et al., p. 150. of books she collected throughout her life, artwork collected over the span of many decades, and well-stocked kitchens. Guardian writer Gary Younge reported that in Angelou's Harlem home were several African wall hangings and her collection of paintings, including ones of several jazz trumpeters, a watercolor of Rosa Parks, and a Faith Ringgold work entitled \\"Maya's Quilt Of Life\\". According to Gillespie, she hosted several celebrations per year at her main residence in Winston-Salem; \\"her skill in the kitchen is the stuff of legend‚Äîfrom haute cuisine to down-home comfort food\\". The Winston-Salem Journal stated: \\"Securing an invitation to one of Angelou's Thanksgiving dinners, Christmas tree decorating parties or birthday parties was among the most coveted invitations in town.\\" The New York Times, describing Angelou's residence history in New York City, stated that she regularly hosted elaborate New Year's Day parties. She combined her cooking and writing skills in her 2004 book Hallelujah! The Welcome Table, which featured 73 recipes, many of which she learned from her grandmother and mother, accompanied by 28 vignettes. She followed up in 2010 with her second cookbook, Great Food, All Day Long: Cook Splendidly, Eat Smart, which focused on weight loss and portion control. Beginning with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, Angelou used the same \\"writing ritual\\" for many years. She would wake early in the morning and check into a hotel room, where the staff was instructed to remove any pictures from the walls. She would write on legal pads while lying on the bed, with only a bottle of sherry, a deck of cards to play solitaire, Roget's Thesaurus, and the Bible, and would leave by the early afternoon. She would average 10‚Äì12 pages of written material a day, which she edited down to three or four pages in the evening. She went through this process to \\"enchant\\" herself, and as she said in a 1989 interview with the British Broadcasting Corporation, \\"relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang\\". She placed herself back in the time she wrote about, even traumatic experiences such as her rape in Caged Bird, in order to \\"tell the human truth\\" about her life. Angelou stated that she played cards in order to get to that place of enchantment and in order to access her memories more effectively. She said, \\"It may take an hour to get into it, but once I'm in it‚Äîha! It's so delicious!\\" She did not find the process cathartic; rather, she found relief in \\"telling the truth\\". Death Angelou died on the morning of May 28, 2014 at the age 86. She was found by her nurse. Although Angelou had reportedly been in poor health and had canceled recent scheduled appearances, she was working on another book, an autobiography about her experiences with national and world leaders. During her memorial service at Wake Forest University, her son Guy Johnson stated that despite being in constant pain due to her dancing career and respiratory failure, she wrote four books during the last ten years of her life. He said, \\"She left this mortal plane with no loss of acuity and no loss in comprehension.\\" Tributes to Angelou and condolences were paid by artists, entertainers, and world leaders, including Obama, whose sister was named after Angelou, and Bill Clinton. Harold Augenbraum, from the National Book Foundation, said that Angelou's \\"legacy is one that all writers and readers across the world can admire and aspire to.\\" The week after Angelou's death, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings rose to number 1 on Amazon.com's bestseller list. On May 29, 2014, Mount Zion Baptist Church in Winston-Salem, of which Angelou was a member for 30 years, held a public memorial service to honor her. On June 7, a private memorial service was held at Wait Chapel on the campus of Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem. The memorial was shown live on local stations in the Winston-Salem/Triad area and streamed live on the university web site with speeches from her son, Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama, and Bill Clinton. On June 15, a memorial was held at Glide Memorial Church in San Francisco, where Angelou was a member for many years. Rev. Cecil Williams, Mayor Ed Lee, and former mayor Willie Brown spoke.  Works  Angelou wrote a total of seven autobiographies. According to scholar Mary Jane Lupton, Angelou's third autobiography Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas marked the first time a well-known African-American autobiographer had written a third volume about her life.Lupton, p. 98. Her books \\"stretch over time and place\\", from Arkansas to Africa and back to the U.S., and take place from the beginnings of World War II to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.Lupton, p. 1. In her fifth autobiography ‚ÄúAll God‚Äôs Children Need Travelling Shoes‚Äù (1986) Angelou tells about her return to Ghana searching for the past of her tribe. She published her seventh autobiography Mom & Me & Mom in 2013, at the age of 85. Critics have tended to judge Angelou's subsequent autobiographies \\"in light of the first\\", with Caged Bird receiving the highest praise. Angelou wrote five collections of essays, which writer Hilton Als called her \\"wisdom books\\" and \\"homilies strung together with autobiographical texts\\". Angelou used the same editor throughout her writing career, Robert Loomis, an executive editor at Random House; he retired in 2011 and has been called \\"one of publishing's hall of fame editors.\\" Angelou said regarding Loomis: \\"We have a relationship that's kind of famous among publishers.\\"Tate, p. 155. Angelou's long and extensive career also included poetry, plays, screenplays for television and film, directing, acting, and public speaking. She was a prolific writer of poetry; her volume Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971) was nominated for the Pulitzer Prize, and she was chosen by U.S. President Bill Clinton to recite her poem \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" during his inauguration in 1993. Angelou's successful acting career included roles in numerous plays, films, and television programs, including her appearance in the television mini-series Roots in 1977. Her screenplay, Georgia, Georgia (1972), was the first original script by a black woman to be produced, and she was the first African-American woman to direct a major motion picture, Down in the Delta, in 1998. = Chronology of autobiographies = * I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings (1969): Up to 1944 (age 17) * Gather Together in My Name (1974): 1944‚Äì48 * Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas (1976): 1949‚Äì55 * The Heart of a Woman (1981): 1957‚Äì62 * All God's Children Need Traveling Shoes (1986): 1962‚Äì65 * A Song Flung Up to Heaven (2002): 1965‚Äì68 * Mom & Me & Mom (2013): overview  Reception and legacy  = Influence = US President Barack Obama presenting Angelou with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, 2011 When I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings was published in 1969, Angelou was hailed as a new kind of memoirist, one of the first African-American women who were able to publicly discuss their personal lives. According to scholar Hilton Als, up to that point, black female writers were marginalized to the point that they were unable to present themselves as central characters in the literature they wrote. Linguist John McWhorter agreed, seeing Angelou's works, which he called \\"tracts\\", as \\"apologetic writing\\". He placed Angelou in the tradition of African-American literature as a defense of black culture, which he called \\"a literary manifestation of the imperative that reigned in the black scholarship of the period\\".McWhorter, p. 40. Writer Julian Mayfield, who called Caged Bird \\"a work of art that eludes description\\", argued that Angelou's autobiographies set a precedent for not only other black women writers, but also African- American autobiography as a whole. Als said that Caged Bird marked one of the first times that a black autobiographer could, as he put it, \\"write about blackness from the inside, without apology or defense\\". Through the writing of her autobiography, Angelou became recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for blacks and women.Braxton, p. 4. It made her \\"without a doubt, ... America's most visible black woman autobiographer\\", and \\"a major autobiographical voice of the time\\".Long, p. 85. As writer Gary Younge said, \\"Probably more than almost any other writer alive, Angelou's life literally is her work.\\" Als said that Caged Bird helped increase black feminist writings in the 1970s, less through its originality than \\"its resonance in the prevailing Zeitgeist\\", or the time in which it was written, at the end of the American Civil Rights Movement. Als also claimed that Angelou's writings, more interested in self-revelation than in politics or feminism, have freed other female writers to \\"open themselves up without shame to the eyes of the world\\". Angelou critic Joanne M. Braxton stated that Caged Bird was \\"perhaps the most aesthetically pleasing\\" autobiography written by an African-American woman in its era. Angelou's poetry has influenced the modern hip-hop music community, including artists such as Kanye West, Common, Tupac Shakur, and Nicki Minaj. = Critical reception = Reviewer Elsie B. Washington, most likely due to President Clinton's choice of Angelou to recite her poem \\"On the Pulse of Morning\\" at his 1993 inauguration, called her \\"the black woman's poet laureate\\". Sales of the paperback version of her books and poetry rose by 300‚Äì600% the week after Angelou's recitation. Random House, which published the poem later that year, had to reprint 400,000 copies of all her books to keep up with the demand. They sold more of her books in January 1993 than they did in all of 1992, accounting for a 1200% increase. Angelou famously said, in response to criticism regarding using the details of her life in her work, \\"I agree with Balzac and 19th-century writers, black and white, who say, 'I write for money'.\\" Younge, speaking after the publication of Angelou's third book of essays, Letter to My Daughter (2008), has said, \\"For the last couple of decades she has merged her various talents into a kind of performance art‚Äîissuing a message of personal and social uplift by blending poetry, song and conversation.\\" Angelou's books, especially I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, have been criticized by many parents, causing their removal from school curricula and library shelves. According to the National Coalition Against Censorship, parents and schools have objected to Caged Birds depictions of lesbianism, premarital cohabitation, pornography, and violence. Some have been critical of the book's sexually explicit scenes, use of language, and irreverent depictions of religion. Caged Bird appeared third on the American Library Association (ALA) list of the 100 Most Frequently Challenged Books of 1990‚Äì2000 and sixth on the ALA's 2000‚Äì2009 list. = Awards and honors = Angelou was honored by universities, literary organizations, government agencies, and special interest groups. Her honors included a Pulitzer Prize nomination for her book of poetry, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie, a Tony Award nomination for her role in the 1973 play Look Away, and three Grammys for her spoken word albums. She served on two presidential committees, and was awarded the Spingarn Medal in 1994, the National Medal of Arts in 2000, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2011. Angelou was awarded more than fifty honorary degrees. = Uses in education = Angelou's autobiographies have been used in narrative and multicultural approaches in teacher education. Jocelyn A. Glazier, a professor at George Washington University, has trained teachers how to \\"talk about race\\" in their classrooms with I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings and Gather Together in My Name. According to Glazier, Angelou's use of understatement, self-mockery, humor, and irony have left readers of Angelou's autobiographies unsure of what she left out and how they should respond to the events she described. Angelou's depictions of her experiences of racism have forced white readers to either explore their feelings about race and their own \\"privileged status\\", or to avoid the discussion as a means of keeping their privilege. Glazier found that critics have focused on the way Angelou fits within the genre of African-American autobiography and on her literary techniques, but readers have tended to react to her storytelling with \\"surprise, particularly when [they] enter the text with certain expectations about the genre of autobiography\\". Educator Daniel Challener, in his 1997 book Stories of Resilience in Childhood, analyzed the events in Caged Bird to illustrate resiliency in children. He argued that Angelou's book has provided a \\"useful framework\\" for exploring the obstacles many children like Maya have faced and how their communities have helped them succeed. Psychologist Chris Boyatzis has reported using Caged Bird to supplement scientific theory and research in the instruction of child development topics such as the development of self-concept and self-esteem, ego resilience, industry versus inferiority, effects of abuse, parenting styles, sibling and friendship relations, gender issues, cognitive development, puberty, and identity formation in adolescence. He found Caged Bird a \\"highly effective\\" tool for providing real-life examples of these psychological concepts.  Poetry  Angelou is best known for her seven autobiographies, but she was also a prolific and successful poet. She was called \\"the black woman's poet laureate\\", and her poems have been called the anthems of African Americans. Angelou studied and began writing poetry at a young age, and used poetry and other great literature to cope with her rape as a young girl, as described in Caged Bird. According to scholar Yasmin Y. DeGout, literature also affected Angelou's sensibilities as the poet and writer she became, especially the \\"liberating discourse that would evolve in her own poetic canon\\".DeGout, p. 122. Many critics consider Angelou's autobiographies more important than her poetry. Although all her books have been best-sellers, her poetry has not been perceived to be as serious as her prose and has been understudied. Her poems were more interesting when she recited and performed them, and many critics emphasized the public aspect of her poetry.Burr, p. 181. Angelou's lack of critical acclaim has been attributed to both the public nature of many of her poems and to Angelou's popular success, and to critics' preferences for poetry as a written form rather than a verbal, performed one. Zofia Burr has countered Angelou's critics by condemning them for not taking into account Angelou's larger purposes in her writing: \\"to be representative rather than individual, authoritative rather than confessional\\".Burr, p. 183.  Style and genre in autobiographies  Angelou's use of fiction-writing techniques such as dialogue, characterization, and development of theme, setting, plot, and language has often resulted in the placement of her books into the genre of autobiographical fiction.Lupton, p. 29‚Äì30. Angelou made a deliberate attempt in her books to challenge the common structure of the autobiography by critiquing, changing, and expanding the genre.Lauret, p. 98. Scholar Mary Jane Lupton argues that all of Angelou's autobiographies conform to the genre's standard structure: they are written by a single author, they are chronological, and they contain elements of character, technique, and theme.Lupton, p. 32. Angelou recognizes that there are fictional aspects to her books; Lupton agrees, stating that Angelou tended to \\"diverge from the conventional notion of autobiography as truth\\",Lupton, p. 34. which parallels the conventions of much of African-American autobiography written during the abolitionist period of U.S. history, when as both Lupton and African-American scholar Crispin Sartwell put it, the truth was censored out of the need for self-protection. Scholar Lyman B. Hagen places Angelou in the long tradition of African-American autobiography, but claims that Angelou created a unique interpretation of the autobiographical form.Hagen, pp. 6‚Äì7. York College in February 2013 According to African-American literature scholar Pierre A. Walker, the challenge for much of the history of African-American literature was that its authors have had to confirm its status as literature before they could accomplish their political goals, which was why Angelou's editor Robert Loomis was able to dare her into writing Caged Bird by challenging her to write an autobiography that could be considered \\"high art\\".Walker, p. 92. Angelou acknowledged that she followed the slave narrative tradition of \\"speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'\\". Scholar John McWhorter calls Angelou's books \\"tracts\\" that defend African-American culture and fight negative stereotypes. According to McWhorter, Angelou structured her books, which to him seem to be written more for children than for adults, to support her defense of black culture. McWhorter sees Angelou as she depicts herself in her autobiographies \\"as a kind of stand-in figure for the black American in Troubled Times\\". McWhorter views Angelou's works as dated, but recognizes that \\"she has helped to pave the way for contemporary black writers who are able to enjoy the luxury of being merely individuals, no longer representatives of the race, only themselves\\".McWhorter, p. 41. Scholar Lynn Z. Bloom compares Angelou's works to the writings of Frederick Douglass, stating that both fulfilled the same purpose: to describe black culture and to interpret it for their wider, white audiences. According to scholar Sondra O'Neale, Angelou's poetry can be placed within the African-American oral tradition, and her prose \\"follows classic technique in nonpoetic Western forms\\".O'Neale, p. 32. O'Neale states that Angelou avoided using a \\"monolithic black language\\",O'Neale, p. 34. and accomplished, through direct dialogue, what O'Neale calls a \\"more expected ghetto expressiveness\\". McWhorter finds both the language Angelou used in her autobiographies and the people she depicted unrealistic, resulting in a separation between her and her audience. As McWhorter states, \\"I have never read autobiographical writing where I had such a hard time summoning a sense of how the subject talks, or a sense of who the subject really is\\".McWhorter, p. 39. McWhorter asserts, for example, that key figures in Angelou's books, like herself, her son Guy, and mother Vivian do not speak as one would expect, and that their speech is \\"cleaned up\\" for her readers.McWhorter, p. 38. Guy, for example, represents the young black male, while Vivian represents the idealized mother figure, and the stiff language they use, as well as the language in Angelou's text, is intended to prove that blacks can use standard English competently.McWhorter, pp. 40‚Äì41. McWhorter recognizes that much of the reason for Angelou's style was the \\"apologetic\\" nature of her writing. When Angelou wrote Caged Bird at the end of the 1960s, one of the necessary and accepted features of literature at the time was \\"organic unity\\", and one of her goals was to create a book that satisfied that criterion. The events in her books were episodic and crafted like a series of short stories, but their arrangements did not follow a strict chronology. Instead, they were placed to emphasize the themes of her books, which include racism, identity, family, and travel. English literature scholar Valerie Sayers has asserted that \\"Angelou's poetry and prose are similar\\". They both rely on her \\"direct voice\\", which alternates steady rhythms with syncopated patterns and uses similes and metaphors (e.g., the caged bird). According to Hagen, Angelou's works were influenced by both conventional literary and the oral traditions of the African-American community. For example, she referenced more than 100 literary characters throughout her books and poetry.Hagen, p. 63. In addition, she used the elements of blues music, including the act of testimony when speaking of one's life and struggles, ironic understatement, and the use of natural metaphors, rhythms, and intonations.Hagen, p. 61. Angelou, instead of depending upon plot, used personal and historical events to shape her books.Lupton, p. 142.

It is one of the highest peaks in the east of the Taurus Mountains. Location and description Some of the statues near the peak of Mount Nemrut The mountain lies north of Kahta, near Adƒ±yaman. In 62 BCE, King Antiochus I Theos of Commagene built on the mountain top a tomb-sanctuary flanked by huge statues of himself, two lions, two eagles and various Greek and Iranian gods, such as Heracles-Artagnes-Ares, Zeus- Oromasdes, and Apollo-Mithras-Helios-Hermes. These statues were once seated, with names of each god inscribed on them. The heads of the statues at some stage have been removed from their bodies, and they are now scattered throughout the site. The pattern of damage to the heads (notably to noses) suggests that they were deliberately damaged as a result of iconoclasm. The statues have not been restored to their original positions. The site also preserves stone slabs with bas-relief figures that are thought to have formed a large frieze. These slabs display the ancestors of Antiochus, who included Greeks and Persians. The same statues and ancestors found throughout the site can also be found on the tumulus at the site, which is and in diameter. It is possible that the tumulus of loose rock was built to protect a tomb from robbers, since any excavation would quickly fill in. The statues appear to have Greek-style facial features, but Persian clothing and hair-styling. The Lion with the Stars The western terrace contains a large slab with a lion, showing an arrangement of stars and the planets Jupiter, Mercury and Mars. The composition was taken to be a chart of the sky on 7 July 62 BCE. The authors chose that date in preference to 23 July 49 BCE which other researchers prefer, see This may be an indication of when construction began on this monument. The eastern portion is well preserved, being composed of several layers of rock, and a path following the base of the mountain is evidence of a walled passageway linking the eastern and western terraces. Possible uses for this site are thought to have included religious ceremonies, owing to the astronomical and religious nature of the monument. The arrangement of such statues is known by the term hierothesion. Similar arrangements have been found at Arsameia on Nymphaios at the hierothesion of Mithridates I Callinicus, the father of Antiochus.  Ancient history  When the Seleucid Empire was defeated by the Romans in 190 BC at the Battle of Magnesia it began to fall apart and new kingdoms were established on its territory by local authorities. Commagene, one of the Seleucid successor states, occupied a land between the Taurus mountains and the Euphrates. The state of Commagene had a wide range of cultures which left its leader from 62 BC ‚Äì 38 BC Antiochus I Theos to carry on a peculiar dynastic religious program, which included not only Greek and Iranian deities but Antiochus and his family as well. This religious program was very possibly an attempt by Antiochus to unify his multiethnic kingdom and secure his dynasty's authority. Antiochus supported the cult as a propagator of happiness and salvation. Many of the ruins on Mount Nemrud are monuments of the imperial cult of Commagene. The most important area to the cult was the tomb of Antiochus I, which was decorated with colossal statues made of limestone. Although the imperial cult did not last long after Antiochus, several of his successors had their own tombs built on Mount Nemrud. For around half of the year, Mount Nemrud is covered in snow, the effect of which increases weathering, which has in part caused the statues to fall in ruin. Modern history The site was excavated in 1881 by , a German engineer assessing transport routes for the Ottomans. After her first visit in 1947, Theresa Goell dedicated her life to the site, starting campaigns in 1954. Subsequent excavations have failed to reveal the tomb of Antiochus. This is nevertheless still believed to be the site of his burial. The statues, all of them \\"beheaded\\", have not been restored to their original condition. World Heritage Site In 1987, Mount Nemrut was made a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. Tourists typically visit Nemrut during April through October. The nearby town of Adƒ±yaman is a popular place for car and bus trips to the site, and one can also travel from there by helicopter. There are also overnight tours running out of Malatya or Kahta.

They are generally soft to the touch, movable, and painless. They usually occur just under the skin, but occasionally may be deeper. Most are less than 5 cm in size. Common locations include upper back, shoulders, and abdomen. A few people have a number of lipomas. The cause is generally unclear. Risk factors include family history, obesity, and lack of exercise. Diagnosis is typically based on a physical exam. Occasionally medical imaging or tissue biopsy is used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is typically by observation or surgical removal. Rarely, the condition may recur following removal, but this can generally be managed with repeat surgery. They are not generally associated with a future risk of cancer. About 2% of people are affected. Lipomas typically occur in adults between 40 and 60 years of age. Males are more often affected than females. They are the most common noncancerous soft-tissue tumor. The first use of the term \\"lipoma\\" to describe these tumors was in 1709.  Types  The many subtypes of lipomas include: * Adenolipomas are lipomas associated with eccrine sweat glands. * Angiolipoleiomyomas are acquired, solitary, asymptomatic acral nodules, characterized histologically by well-circumscribed subcutaneous tumors composed of smooth muscle cells, blood vessels, connective tissue, and fat. * Angiolipomas are painful subcutaneous nodules having all other features of a typical lipoma. * Cerebellar pontine angle and internal auditory canal lipomas * Chondroid lipomas are deep-seated, firm, yellow tumors that characteristically occur on the legs of women. * Corpus callosum lipoma is a rare congenital brain condition that may or may not present with symptoms. This occurs in the corpus callosum, also known as the calossal commissure, which is a wide, flat bundle of neural fibers beneath the cortex in the human brain. * Hibernomas are lipomas of brown fat. * Intradermal spindle cell lipomas are distinct in that they most commonly affect women and have a wide distribution, occurring with relatively equal frequency on the head and neck, trunk, and upper and lower extremities. Fibrolipoma: Large amounts of fibrous tissue. *A fibrolipoma is a lipoma with focal areas of large amounts of fibrous tissue. A sclerotic lipoma is a predominantly fibrous lesion with focal areas of fat. :* Neural fibrolipomas are overgrowths of fibro-fatty tissue along a nerve trunk, which often leads to nerve compression. * Pleomorphic lipomas, like spindle-cell lipomas, occur for the most part on the backs and necks of elderly men and are characterized by floret giant cells with overlapping nuclei. * Spindle-cell lipomas are asymptomatic, slow-growing, subcutaneous tumors that have a predilection for the posterior back, neck, and shoulders of older men. * Superficial subcutaneous lipomas, the most common type of lipoma, lie just below the surface of the skin. Most occur on the trunk, thigh, and forearm, although they may be found anywhere in the body where fat is located.  Causes  The tendency to develop a lipoma is not necessarily hereditary, although hereditary conditions such as familial multiple lipomatosis might include lipoma development. Genetic studies in mice have shown a correlation between the HMG I-C gene (previously identified as a gene related to obesity) and lipoma development. These studies support prior epidemiologic data in humans showing a correlation between HMG I-C and mesenchymal tumors. Cases have been reported where minor injuries are alleged to have triggered the growth of a lipoma, called a \\"post-traumatic lipoma\\". However, the link between trauma and the development of lipomas is controversial. = Other conditions = Lipomatosis is believed to be a hereditary condition in which multiple lipomas are present on the body. Adiposis dolorosa (Dercum disease) is a rare condition involving multiple painful lipomas, swelling, and fatigue. Early studies mentioned prevalence in obese postmenopausal women. However, current literature demonstrates that Dercum disease is present in more women than men of all body types; the average age for diagnosis is 35 years. Benign symmetric lipomatosis (Madelung disease) is another condition involving lipomatosis. It nearly always appears in middle-aged males after many years of alcoholism, but nonalcoholic males and females can also be affected.  Diagnosis  A physical exam is typically the easiest way to diagnose it. Rarely, a tissue biopsy or imaging may be required. The imaging modality of choice is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), because it has superior sensitivity of distinguishing it from liposarcoma as well as mapping the surrounding anatomy. File:Lipoma 05.jpgX-ray of a lipoma File:Ultrasonography of a lipoma.jpgMedical ultrasonography of a lipoma in the thenar eminence: It is hyperechoic compared to adjacent muscle, and relatively well-defined, with miniature hyperechoic lines.

Treatment  Usually, treatment of lipomas is not necessary, unless they become painful or restrict movement. They are usually removed for cosmetic reasons if they grow very large or for histopathology to verify that they are not a more dangerous type of tumor such as a liposarcoma. This last point can be important, as the characteristics of a tumor are not known until after it is removed and medically examined. Lipomas are normally removed by simple excision. The removal can often be done under local anesthetic and takes less than 30 minutes. This cures the great majority of cases, with about 1‚Äì2% of lipomas recurring after excision. Liposuction is another option if the lipoma is soft and has a small connective tissue component. Liposuction typically results in less scarring; however, with large lipomas, it may fail to remove the entire tumor, which can lead to regrowth. New methods under development are supposed to remove the lipomas without scarring. One is removal by injecting compounds that trigger lipolysis, such as steroids or phosphatidylcholine. Other potential methods based on tissue- targeted heating include cauterization, electrosurgery, and harmonic scalpel. File:Lipoma 03.jpgIntraoperative photo.

It measured about 10 cm in diameter at the time of removal. In the center is a section of skin which was removed with the lipoma.  Prognosis  Lipomas are rarely life-threatening, and the common subcutaneous lipomas are not a serious condition. Lipomas growing in internal organs can be more dangerous; for example, lipomas in the gastrointestinal tract can cause bleeding, ulceration, and painful obstructions (so-called \\"malignant by location\\", despite being a benign growth histologically). Malignant transformation of lipomas into liposarcomas is very rare, and most liposarcomas are not produced from pre-existing benign lesions. A few cases of malignant transformation have been described for bone and kidney lipomas, but it is possible that these few reported cases were well-differentiated liposarcomas in which the subtle malignant characteristics were missed when the tumor was first examined. Deep lipomas have a greater tendency to recur than superficial lipomas because complete surgical removal of deep lipomas is not always possible. The presence of multiple lipomas, lipomatosis, is more commonly encountered in men. Some superficial lipomas can extend into deep fascia and may complicate excision. Liposarcoma is found in 1% of lipomas and is more likely to occur in lesions of the lower extremities, shoulders, and retroperitoneal areas. Other risk factors for liposarcoma include large size (>5 cm), associated with calcification, rapid growth, and/or invasion into nearby structures or through fascia into muscle tissue.E.J. Mayeaux Jr. (2009). The Essential Guide to Primary Care Procedures, p.386, Wolters Kluwer Health. .  Epidemiology  Around 2% of the general population has a lipoma. These tumors can occur at any age, but are most common in middle age, often appearing in people from 40 to 60 years old. Cutaneous lipomas are rare in children, but these tumors can occur as part of the inherited disease Bannayan-Zonana syndrome. Lipomas are usually relatively small with diameters of about 1‚Äì3 cm,Lipoma‚Äîtopic overview at webmd.com but in rare cases they can grow over several years into \\"giant lipomas\\" that are 10‚Äì20 cm across and weigh up to 4‚Äì5 kg.  Other animals  Lipomas occur in many animals, but are most common in older dogs, particularly older Labrador Retrievers, Doberman Pinschers, and Miniature Schnauzers. Overweight female dogs are especially prone to developing these tumors, and most older or overweight dogs have at least one lipoma.Lipomas Veterinary & Aquatic Services Department, PurinaLipoma Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University In dogs, lipomas usually occur in the trunk or upper limbs.Adipose Tissue Tumors The Merck Veterinary Manual, (9th ed.) They are also found less commonly in cattle and horses, and rarely in cats and pigs.Lipomas (Fatty Tumors) Veterinary Q & A However, a pedunculated lipoma can cause entrapment and torsion of the intestine in horses, causing necrosis, colic, and possibly death. The intestine becomes wound around the stalk of the lipoma and loses blood supply.

He has been the bassist for B√©la Fleck and the Flecktones since the group's formation in 1988 and a member of the band SMV with two other bassists, Stanley Clarke and Marcus Miller. Since 2017 he has played bass for the metal band Nitro. He owns Vix Records which releases his albums. He wrote the novel The Music Lesson: A Spiritual Search for Growth Through Music.Salina Journal (2010) Wooten has won the Bass Player of the Year award from Bass Player magazine three times and is the first person to win the award more than once. In 2011, he was ranked No. 10 in the Top 10 Bassists of All Time by Rolling Stone magazine. Early life and career Wooten plays his headless bass guitar known as his \\"Sitar Bass\\" at the Belly Up in San Diego 2006. Born to Dorothy and Elijah Wooten, Victor is the youngest of the five Wooten brothers; Regi, Roy, Rudy, and Joseph Wooten are all musicians. Regi began to teach Victor to play bass when he was two, and by the age of six, he was performing with his brothers in their family band, The Wooten Brothers Band. As a United States Air Force family, they moved often when Wooten was young. The family settled in Newport News, Virginia in 1972. Wooten graduated from Denbigh High School in 1982. While in high school, he and his brothers played in the country music venue at Busch Gardens theme park in Williamsburg, Virginia. In 1987, he traveled to Nashville, Tennessee, to visit friends that he made at the theme park. One of them was a studio engineer who introduced him to B√©la Fleck, with whom he has often collaborated.McDonald, Sam (February 21, 2000) \\"High Profile: Victor Wooten\\", Daily Press, Retrieved 2016-03-04 In 2000 Wooten created a music program called Bass/Nature camp that was expanded into Victor Wooten's Center for Music and Nature and includes all instruments. His camps are at Wooten Woods, a 147-acre retreat in Only, Tennessee, near Nashville. Wooten co-leads the \\"Victor Wooten/Berklee Summer Bass Workshop\\" at Berklee College of Music in Boston. At Berklee and his own camps, he collaborates with Berklee Bass Department chair, Steve Bailey. The two bassists have been teaching together since the early 1990s. He was featured on the May/June 2014 cover of Making Music Magazine to discuss the camps. Instruments Wooten is most often seen playing Fodera basses, of which he has a signature model. His most famous Fodera, a 1983 Monarch Deluxe he refers to as \\"number 1,\\" sports a Kahler Tremolo System model 2400 bridge. Fodera's \\"Yin Yang\\" basses (co-designed by and created for Wooten) incorporates the Yin Yang symbol‚Äîwhich Wooten uses in various media‚Äîas a focal point of the top's design and construction. The symbol is created from two pieces of naturally finished wood (Ebony and Holly, for example), fitted together to create the Yin-Yang pattern. As well as playing electric bass (both fretted and fretless) and the double bass, he played cello in high school. He still plays cello occasionally with the Flecktones as well as in the 2012 Sword and Stone/Words and Tones tour. Discography =Solo albums= * A Show of Hands (Compass, 1996) * What Did He Say?

Drawing of the inscription of the hymn text (1908 publication). The Great Hymn to the Aten is the longest of a number of hymn-poems written to the sun-disk deity Aten. Composed in the middle of the 14th century BC, it is varyingly attributed to the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Akhenaten or his courtiers, depending on the version, who radically changed traditional forms of Egyptian religion by replacing them with Atenism. The hymn-poem provides a glimpse of the religious artistry of the Amarna period expressed in multiple forms encompassing literature, new temples, and in the building of a whole new city at the site of present-day Amarna as the capital of Egypt. Egyptologist Toby Wilkinson said that \\"It has been called 'one of the most significant and splendid pieces of poetry to survive from the pre-Homeric world.'\\" Egyptologist John Darnell asserts that the hymn was sung. Various courtiers' rock tombs at Amarna (ancient Akhet-Aten, the city Akhenaten founded) have similar prayers or hymns to the deity Aten or to the Aten and Akhenaten jointly. One of these, found in almost identical form in five tombs, is known as The Short Hymn to the Aten. The long version discussed in this article was found in the tomb of the courtier (and later Pharaoh) Ay. The 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Akhenaten forbade the worship of other gods, a radical departure from the centuries of Egyptian religious practice. Akhenaton's religious reforms (later regarded heretical and reversed under his successor Pharaoh Tutankhamun) have been described by some scholars as monotheistic, though others consider them to be henotheistic. Excerpts of the hymn-poem to Aten These particular excerpts are not attributed to Aten himself, this long version was found in the tomb of the courtier Ay. From the middle of the text: :How manifold it is, what thou hast made! :They are hidden from the face (of man). :O sole god, like whom there is no other! :Thou didst create the world according to thy desire, :Whilst thou wert alone: All men, cattle, and wild beasts, :Whatever is on Earth, going upon (its) feet, :And what is on high, flying with its wings. :The countries of Syria and Nubia, the land of Egypt, :Thou settest every man in his place, :Thou suppliest their necessities: :Everyone has his food, and his time of life is reckoned. :Their tongues are separate in speech, :And their natures as well; :Their skins are distinguished, :As thou distinguishest the foreign peoples. :Thou makest a Nile in the underworld, :Thou bringest forth as thou desirest :To maintain the people (of Egypt) :According as thou madest them for thyself, :The lord of all of them, wearying (himself) with them, :The lord of every land, rising for them, :The Aton of the day, great of majesty.Pritchard, James B., ed., The Ancient Near East ‚Äì Volume 1: An Anthology of Texts and Pictures, Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1958, pp. 227-230. From the last part of the text, translated by Miriam Lichtheim: :You are in my heart, :There is no other who knows you, :Only your son, Neferkheprure, Sole-one-of-Re [Akhenaten], :Whom you have taught your ways and your might. :[Those on] Earth come from your hand as you made them. :When you have dawned they live. :When you set they die; :You yourself are lifetime, one lives by you. :All eyes are on [your] beauty until you set. :All labor ceases when you rest in the west; :When you rise you stir [everyone] for the King, :Every leg is on the move since you founded the Earth. :You rouse them for your son who came from your body. :The King who lives by Maat, the Lord of the Two Lands, :Neferkheprure, Sole-one-of-Re, :The Son of Re who lives by Maat. the Lord of crowns, :Akhenaten, great in his lifetime; :(And) the great Queen whom he loves, the Lady of the Two Lands, :Nefer-nefru-Aten Nefertiti, living forever. Analysis Analyses of the poem are divided between those considering it as a work of literature, and those considering its political and socio-religious intentions. James Henry Breasted considered Akhenaten to be the first monotheist and scientist in history.

Miriam Lichtheim describes the hymn as \\"a beautiful statement of the doctrine of the One God.\\". In 1913, Henry Hall contended that the pharaoh was the \\"first example of the scientific mind.\\"H. R. Hall, Ancient History of the Near East (1913), p. 599. In his book Reflections on the Psalms, C.S. Lewis compared the Hymn to the Psalms of the Judaeo-Christian canon, as did Breasted (who broke them up into stanzas to resemble Western poems). Miriam Lichtheim commented about an alleged resemblance with Psalm 104 saying that \\"The resemblances are, however, more likely to be the result of the generic similarity between Egyptian hymns and biblical psalms. A specific literary interdependence is not probable.\\" Biblical scholar Mark S. Smith has commented that \\"Despite enduring support for the comparison of the two texts, enthusiasm for even indirect influence has been tempered in recent decades. In some quarters, the argument for any form of influence is simply rejected outright. Still some Egyptologists, such as Jan Assmann and Donald Redford, argue for Egyptian influence on both the Amarna correspondence (especially in EA 147) and on Psalm 104.\\" Egyptologist Dominic Montserrat discusses the terminology used to describe these texts, describing them as formal poems or royal eulogies. He views the word 'hymn' as suggesting \\"outpourings of emotion\\" while he sees them as \\"eulogies, formal and rhetorical statements of praise\\" honoring Aten and the royal couple. He credits James Henry Breasted with the popularisation of them as hymns saying that Breasted (erroneously) saw them as \\"a gospel of the beauty and beneficence of the natural order, a recognition of the message of nature to the soul of man\\"(quote from Breasted). Montserrat argues that all the versions of the hymns focus on the king and suggests that the real innovation is to redefine the relationship of god and king in a way that benefited Akhenaten, quoting the statement of Egyptologist John Baines that \\"Amarna religion was a religion of god and king, or even of king first and then god.\\" Donald B. Redford argued that while Akhenaten called himself the son of the Sun-Disc and acted as the chief mediator between god and creation, kings for thousands of years before Akhenaten's time had claimed the same relationship and priestly role. However Akhenaten's case may be different through the emphasis placed on the heavenly father and son relationship. Akhenaten described himself as \\"thy son who came forth from thy limbs\\", \\"thy child\\", \\"the eternal son that came forth from the Sun-Disc\\", and \\"thine only son that came forth from thy body\\". The close relationship between father and son is such that only the king truly knows the heart of \\"his father\\", and in return his father listens to his son's prayers. He is his father's image on earth and as Akhenaten is king on earth his father is king in heaven. As high priest, prophet, king and divine he claimed the central position in the new religious system. Since only he knew his father's mind and will, Akhenaten alone could interpret that will for all mankind with true teaching coming only from him.\\"The Monotheism of the Heretic Pharaoh: Precursor of Mosaic monotheism or Egyptian anomaly?\\", Donald B.

The plot centers on a pandemic of a weaponized strain of influenza that kills almost the entire world population. The few survivors, united in groups, establish a new social system and engage in confrontation with each other. In writing the book, King sought to create an epic in the spirit of The Lord of the Rings that was set in contemporary America. The book was difficult for King to write because of the large number of characters and storylines. In 1990, The Stand was reprinted as a Complete and Uncut Edition. King restored some fragments of texts that were initially reduced, revised the order of the chapters, shifted the novel's setting from 1980 to 10 years forward, and accordingly corrected a number of cultural references. The Complete and Uncut Edition of The Stand is considered to be King's longest stand-alone work with its 1,152 pages, surpassing King's 1,138-page novel It. The book has sold 4.5 million copies. The Stand was highly appreciated by reviewers and is considered one of King's best novels. It has been included in lists of the best books of all time by Rolling Stone, Time, the Modern Library, Amazon and the BBC. Reviewers praised the believability of the story, the relevance of the issues raised and the liveliness of the characters, but criticized the protractedness of individual episodes, the plot dualism and the deliberate denouement. A self-titled miniseries based on the novel was broadcast on ABC in 1994. From 2008 to 2012, Marvel Comics published a series of comics written by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa and illustrated by Mike Perkins. A miniseries to air on CBS All Access completed production in March 2020. Plot An extremely contagious and lethal strain of influenza is developed as a biological weapon in a secret U.S. Department of Defense laboratory. It is estimated to be 99.4% fatal. The Complete and Uncut Edition includes a prologue detailing the development of the virus and the security breach that causes its accidental release. Security guard Charles Campion manages to escape before the facility is locked down and takes his family out of the state. After a couple of days, his car crashes at a gas station in Arnette, Texas. Bystanders and ambulance workers become infected by the dying Campion and his dead wife and child. The United States Army attempts to isolate Arnette, going so far as to execute civilians attempting to flee, but in vain; the virus, christened the \\"superflu\\" or \\"Captain Trips\\", spreads across the country. The government then has its agents (unknowingly) release the virus in the USSR, its satellite countries and China to avoid blame and retaliation. When martial law fails to contain the virus, a global pandemic of apocalyptic proportions kills nearly the entire world population within a month. Society collapses with the near- extinction of humanity. Some of the few who are immune also die, unable either to accept the loss of their loved ones or to survive in a world where they must fend for themselves. Stuart \\"Stu\\" Redman, one of the Arnette residents who encountered Campion, proves immune to the virus. He is forcibly held in a research center in Stovington, Vermont, in the hope that a treatment can be found. Stu escapes after the staff become infected, killing one man in self- defense. He meets sociology professor Glen Bateman and his dog Kojak, pregnant college student Frances \\"Frannie\\" Goldsmith, and overweight teenage nerd Harold Lauder. Stuart and Frannie are drawn to each other and eventually fall in love, then enter a marital relationship. This enrages Harold, who has an unhealthy limerence towards Frannie. He then becomes sociopathic and schemes to harm the couple. Most of the survivors experience essentially the same two dreams. In one, a friendly 108-year-old black woman living in Hemingford Home, Nebraska, \\"Mother Abagail\\" Freemantle, invites them to her farm.King used Hemingford for the novel It as well. The Denver Post, USA Weekend, March 19‚Äì20, 2010, usaweekend.com, page 2. They also dream of a terrifying \\"dark man\\" who calls himself Randall Flagg, among other things. People seek out one or the other. Stu and his group eventually meet Mother Abagail, who is convinced God has chosen her to do His will. The group travels to Boulder, Colorado, along with other survivors. These include Larry Underwood, a disillusioned pop singer; Nick Andros, a deaf-mute; Tom Cullen, a kind- hearted, mentally disabled man; Nadine Cross, a teacher in her 30s who is still a virgin; and Ralph Brentner, a good-natured farmer. As survivors continue to trickle in, the group starts organizing the hundreds of residents. They establish their community as the \\"Boulder Free Zone\\", a democratic city- state modeled after the United States' former ideals. Meanwhile, Randall Flagg, who possesses supernatural abilities, creates his own totalitarian society in Las Vegas with psychopaths as his lieutenants. His people worship (and fear) him as a messiah and submit to his iron-fisted dictatorship. He has drug addicts and others who incur his displeasure crucified. Flagg rescues Lloyd Henreid, a mass murderer, from his prison cell and makes him his right- hand man. A pyromaniac nicknamed \\"the Trashcan Man\\" blows up oil tanks in Gary, Indiana, and travels to Las Vegas with a homicidal madman named \\"the Kid\\". The Trashcan Man finds stockpiles of weapons for Flagg, as Flagg prepares for war with the Free Zone. Mother Abagail, believing that she has sinned by being proud, goes into the wilderness on a spiritual journey without consulting anyone. In her absence, the Free Zone's leadership committee decides to secretly send three people to spy on Flagg, but Flagg already knows who two of them are. One dies in a shootout and the other is captured, but manages to kill herself to avoid revealing who the third (Tom Cullen) is. Harold and Nadine secretly give their allegiance to Flagg. In fact, Flagg wants Nadine to be his wife and the mother of his child. Harold plants a bomb in the house where the committee is to meet. The explosion kills seven or eight people, including Nick Andros and Susan Stern, but the other committee members are saved by the commotion caused by Mother Abagail's unexpected return and Frannie's too-late warning. Before dying, the extremely emaciated Mother Abagail reports God's will: Stu, Glen, Larry and Ralph (all of the surviving committee members except for the pregnant Frannie) must go to Las Vegas on foot to destroy Flagg. She also states that only three of them will get there. Harold and Nadine also set out for Las Vegas, but Harold suffers a broken leg in a motorcycle accident (caused by Flagg with his powers) on the way, and Nadine leaves him to die. Flagg comes to Nadine in the desert near Las Vegas and impregnates her; the horrifying experience (his face changes into that of a demon) causes her to lose her mind. Flagg brings her back to Las Vegas as his bride, but she manages to goad him into killing her and their unborn child. Stu breaks his leg en route to Las Vegas and persuades the others to go on without him. The remaining three are quickly taken prisoner. Glen refuses to grovel before Flagg, and when he taunts Flagg, Lloyd kills him under Flagg's orders. Flagg gathers his people to witness Larry and Ralph's executions. Moments before they are about to be torn apart via dismemberment, the Trashcan Man drags in a nuclear warhead (to try to atone for having blown up all of Flagg's experienced pilots), and an act of God detonates the bomb, destroying Las Vegas, as well as Larry and Ralph. The inhabitants of Boulder anxiously await the birth of Frannie's baby. They fear that the child will succumb to the superflu. Soon after her son is born, Stu returns, having been rescued by Tom. The baby contracts the superflu, but manages to recover. Once Frannie is again pregnant, she and Stu decide to leave Boulder and move back to Frannie's hometown of Ogunquit, Maine, where they will found an eastern settlement, and raise their children in peace. The Complete and Uncut Edition includes an epilogue in which Flagg wakes up with memory loss on a beach. From the jungle emerge a dozen dark-skinned men with spears who eventually bow down and worship him. Characters  Background  In Danse Macabre, King writes about the origins of The Stand at some length. One source was Patty Hearst's case. The original idea was to create a novel about the episode because \\"it seemed that only a novel might really succeed in explaining all the contradictions\\". The author also mentions George R. Stewart's novel Earth Abides, which describes the odyssey of one of the last human survivors after the population is nearly annihilated by a plague, as one of the main inspirations: > With my Patty Hearst book, I never found the right way in... and during that > entire six-week period, something else was nagging very quietly at the back > of my mind. It was a news story I had read about an accidental spill in > Utah. (...) This article called up memories of a novel called Earth Abides, > by George R. Stewart. > (...) and one day while sitting at my typewriter, (...) I wrote‚Äîjust to > write something: The world comes to an end but everybody in the SLA is > somehow immune. Snake bit them. I looked at that for a while and then typed: > No more gas shortages. That was sort of cheerful, in a horrible sort of way. The Stand was also planned by King as an epic The Lord of the Rings‚Äìtype story in a contemporary American setting: > For a long time‚Äîten years, at least‚ÄîI had wanted to write a fantasy epic > like The Lord of the Rings, only with an American setting. I just couldn't > figure out how to do it. Then . . . after my wife and kids and I moved to > Boulder, Colorado, I saw a 60 Minutes segment on CBW (chemical-biological > warfare). I never forgot the gruesome footage of the test mice shuddering, > convulsing, and dying, all in twenty seconds or less. That got me > remembering a chemical spill in Utah, that killed a bunch of sheep (these > were canisters on their way to some burial ground; they fell off the truck > and ruptured). I remembered a news reporter saying, 'If the winds had been > blowing the other way, there was Salt Lake City.' This incident later served > as the basis of a movie called Rage, starring George C. Scott, but before it > was released, I was deep into The Stand, finally writing my American fantasy > epic, set in a plague-decimated USA. Only instead of a hobbit, my hero was a > Texan named Stu Redman, and instead of a Dark Lord, my villain was a > ruthless drifter and supernatural madman named Randall Flagg. The land of > Mordor ('where the shadows lie,' according to Tolkien) was played by Las > Vegas. While writing The Stand, King nearly stopped because of writer's block.On Writing, Stephen King, 2000. Eventually, he reached the conclusion that the heroes were becoming too complacent, and were beginning to repeat all the same mistakes of their old society. In an attempt to resolve this, he added the part of the storyline where Harold and Nadine construct a bomb, which explodes in a Free Zone committee meeting, killing Nick Andros, Chad Norris, and Susan Stern. Later, Mother Abagail explains on her deathbed that God permitted the bombing because He was dissatisfied with the heroes' focus on petty politics, and not on the ultimate quest of destroying Flagg. When telling this story, King sardonically observed that the bomb saved the book, and that he only had to kill half of the core cast to do this.  Publication history  The novel was originally published in 1978 in hardcover, with a setting date of 1980, in abridged form. The first paperback release in 1980 changed the setting date to 1985. The novel marks the first appearance of Randall Flagg, King's recurring antagonist, whom King would bring back several times in his later writings. In 1990, an unabridged edition of The Stand was published, billed as The Complete and Uncut Edition. Published in hardcover by Doubleday in May 1990, this became the longest book published by King at 1,152 pages. When the novel was originally published in 1978, Doubleday warned King that the book's size would make it too expensive for the market to bear. As a result, he cut about 400 pages (around 150,000 words) from the original manuscript. This edition reinstates most of the deletions (as selected by King) and updates the setting from the 1980s to the 1990s. This new edition features a new preface by King and illustrations by Bernie Wrightson. Additionally, Doubleday published a deluxe edition of The Stand: The Complete and Uncut Edition, limited to 1,250 numbered copies and 52 lettered copies. This edition, known as the \\"Coffin Box\\" edition due to the book being housed in a wooden case, was signed by King and Wrightson.  Reception  The Stand received critical acclaim; it was nominated for the World Fantasy Award for Best Novel in 1979, and was adapted into both a television miniseries for ABC and a graphic novel published by Marvel Comics. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 53 on the BBC's The Big Read poll. Adaptations = Television = A film adaptation of The Stand was in development hell for over 10 years. During the 1980s, Stephen King had planned a theatrical film, with George A. Romero directing and himself writing, not trusting anybody else with the project. However, writing a workable screenplay proved difficult, due to the novel's length. King talked about adapting it for television, but was informed that the television networks did not \\"want to see the end of the world, particularly in prime time.\\" Eventually King allowed screenwriter Rospo Pallenberg, who was a fan of The Stand, to write his own adaptation of the novel. Pallenberg's script would clock the film in at close to three hours, while still staying true to the novel. Everyone liked the script; however, just as it was about to finally come together, Warner Bros. backed out of the project. ABC eventually offered Stephen King the chance to make The Stand into an eight-hour miniseries. King wrote a new screenplay (toned down slightly for television). The miniseries was broadcast in 1994, directed by Mick Garris, and starred such actors as Gary Sinise, Adam Storke, Molly Ringwald, Rob Lowe, Miguel Ferrer, Laura San Giacomo, Jamey Sheridan, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Bill Fagerbakke, and Shawnee Smith, with notable cameos including John Landis, Ed Harris, Kathy Bates, Sam Raimi, and King himself. Parts of the miniseries were shot in Salt Lake City, Utah State Prison, Sundance, Orem, Provo Canyon, and Salina in Utah. Between 2011 and 2016, Warner Bros. Pictures and CBS Films were developing a feature- length film adaptation of The Stand. In August 2011, director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves, known for their collaboration on the Harry Potter films, were hired to direct/write a multimovie version of The Stand, but left the project in October 2011, as Yates felt it would work better as a miniseries. Both Ben Affleck and Scott Cooper dropped out over creative differences with the studio. On February 25, 2014, Josh Boone was hired to write and direct the adaptation. He later revealed that he wanted Christian Bale to play Randall Flagg and Matthew McConaughey for the role of Stu Redman. By September 10, 2014, the script had been completed and pre-production was underway./ In November, Boone planned to split his adaptation into four full- length feature films in an effort to remain true to the breadth of King's sprawling novel.Fleming Jr., Mike (November 21, 2014). \\"Josh Boone Says Warner Bros Will Turn Stephen King‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Stand‚Äô Into Four Films.\\" Deadline. In June 2015, Warner Bros. proposed an eight-part Showtime miniseries to set up the story, which would culminate in Josh Boone's film. However, in February 2016, The Stand project was put on hold and the rights reverted to CBS Films. In September 2017, King talked of doing an extended TV series on Showtime or CBS All Access. In January 2019, a 10-hour limited series was ordered by CBS Television Studios to be broadcast on CBS All Access. James Marsden, Amber Heard, Whoopi Goldberg, Greg Kinnear, Odessa Young, and Henry Zaga were all in consideration for the roles of Stu Redman, Nadine Cross, Mother Abagail, Glen Bateman, Frannie Goldsmith, and Nick Andros, respectively. The production filmed in British Columbia, Canada from September 2019 to March 2020. The production completed filming a few days before it would have been shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic.https://www.slashfilm.com/the-stand-miniseries- update/?fbclid=IwAR3imo4ST08T6V0BZQEptVDB9ItArBO6tOP8MocJBU1ZrbXUN0bMfWl9EGE.

In the 1970s, a number of fans began travelling to see the band in as many shows or festival venues as they could. With large numbers of people thus attending strings of shows, a community developed. Deadheads developed their own idioms and slang. Much Deadhead-related historical material received or collected by the band over the years is housed in the Grateful Dead Archive of UC Santa Cruz. Archive founding curator Nicholas Meriwether, who has also written extensively about the culture and its impact on society, predicted, \\"The Grateful Dead archive is going to end up being a critical way for us to approach and understand the 1960s and the counterculture of the era... It's also going to tell us a lot about the growth and development of modern rock theater, and it's helping us understand fan culture.\\" Overview By the late 1970s, some Deadheads began to sell tie-dye T-shirts, veggie burritos, or other items at Grateful Dead concerts. This allowed many Deadheads a way to follow the band on its tours. During the early 1980s, the number of Deadheads taping shows increased, and the band created a special section for fans who wished to record the show. These tapes are still shared and circulated today via websites such as the Live Music Archive and bt.etree.org. In the earlier days of the Grateful Dead, there were questions as to whether or not it was in the best interest of the band for fans to tape concerts. In 1982, Garcia himself was asked what he thought about it, and he replied, \\"When we are done with it [the concerts], they can have it.\\" The practice of taping has evolved with the digital age, and the rise of the Internet has made it extremely easy to share concerts through unofficial channels. Origins The term \\"Deadhead\\" first appeared in print at the suggestion of Hank Harrison, author of The Dead Trilogy, on the sleeve of Grateful Dead (also known as Skull & Roses), the band's second live album, released in 1971.Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip edited by Jake Woodward, et al. Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2003, pg. 138. It read: This phenomenon was first touched on in print by Village Voice music critic Robert Christgau at a Felt Forum show in 1971, noting \\"how many 'regulars' seemed to be in attendance, and how, from the way they compared notes, they'd obviously made a determined effort to see as many shows as possible.\\" Eileen Law, a long time friend of the band, was put in charge of the mailing list and maintained the Dead Heads newsletter. It is estimated that by the end of 1971, the band had received about 350 letters, but this number swelled greatly over the next few years to as many as 40,000. In total, 25 mailings/newsletters reached Dead Heads between October 1971 and February 1980. After this time, the Grateful Dead Almanac would succeed it, with this eventually being abandoned for Dead.net. Those who did receive the newsletter in the 1970s often found pleasant surprises sent along. One example is from May 1974 when Heads received a sample EP of Robert Hunter's upcoming album Tales of the Great Rum Runners as well as selections from Jerry Garcia's second album, Compliments of Garcia, and some cuts that were from bandmembers Keith and Donna Godchaux's eponymous solo album, Keith & Donna, both on Round Records. This sample was titled Anton Round, which was an alias used by Ron Rakow.Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip edited by Jake Woodward, et al. Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2003, pg. 168. Impact on shows Fans attending a Grateful Dead concert at Red Rocks, Colorado, 1987. The Grateful Dead's appeal to fans was supported by the way the band structured their concerts. * From the early 1970s (Actually, from the very beginning) on, night-to-night song selection changed over subsequent shows. * Also from the early 1970s on, it could be expected that the band would play (at least) two sets in a show, often with an encore. * From the 1980s on, the second set usually contained a prolonged drum solo, called \\"Drums\\", by Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann (also known as the \\"Rhythm Devils\\") followed by an extended improvisational \\"space\\" jam played by the rest of the band (as featured on the album Infrared Roses). The varied song selection allowed the band to create a \\"rotation\\" of songs that was roughly repeated every 3 to 5 performances (\\"shows\\"). The rotation created two phenomena. The first was that the desire of Deadheads to hear their favorite song or attend a good show led many of them to begin following the band on its tour. The second was that the large number of traveling fans empowered the band to perform multiple shows in each venue with the assurance that the performances would be mostly sold out, as almost all were from the mid 1980s on. In this way, the Deadheads were one of the main driving forces keeping the band going. With large numbers of people thus attending strings of shows, a community developed out of the familiarity. As generations turned from the Acid Tests to the 1970s (and onward), tours became a time to revel with friends at concerts, old and new, who never knew the psychedelic age that spawned the band they loved.Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip edited by Jake Woodward, et al. Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2003, pg. 174. As with any large community, Deadheads developed their own idioms and slang which is amply illustrated in books about the Grateful Dead such as the Skeleton Key. \\"The Vibe\\" Some Deadheads use the term \\"X Factor\\" to describe the intangible element that elevates mere performance into something higher.Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip edited by Jake Woodward, et al. Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2003, pg. 113. Publicist and Jerry Garcia biographer Blair Jackson stated that \\"shows were the sacrament ... rich and full of blissful, transcendent musical moments that moved the body and enriched the soul.\\"Garcia: An American Life by Blair Jackson, Penguin Books, 1999, pg. 219. Phil Lesh himself comments on this phenomenon in his autobiography by saying \\"The unique organicity of our music reflects the fact that each of us consciously personalized his playing: to fit with what others were playing and to fit with who each man was as an individual, allowing us to meld our consciousnesses together in the unity of a group mind.\\"Searching for the Sound: My Life with the Grateful Dead by Phil Lesh, Little, Brown, April 2005 Jackson takes this further, citing drummer Mickey Hart as saying \\"The Grateful Dead weren't in the music business, they were in the transportation business.\\" Jackson relates this to the Deadhead phenomenon directly by saying \\"for many Deadheads, the band was a medium that facilitated experiencing other planes of consciousness and tapping into deep, spiritual wells that were usually the province of organized religion ... [they] got people high whether those people were on drugs or not.\\" (For more on the spiritual aspect, see Spinners in the section below). It was times like these that the band and the audience would become one; The Grateful Dead and the Deadheads were all in the same state of mind.Garcia: An American Life by Blair Jackson, Penguin Books, 1999, pg. 319. Rock producer Bill Graham summarized much of the band's effect when he created a sign for the Grateful Dead when the group played the closing of the Winterland Ballroom on December 31, 1978 that read:Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip edited by Jake Woodward, et al. Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2003, pg. 227. The \\"Vibe\\" of the Grateful Dead is kept alive today by the many festivals that celebrate their traditions. Through the years * 1960s ‚Äì Before the term was invented, The Grateful Dead became one of the first cult acts in music. Although not as mainstream as other psychedelic bands, they were the leaders of the Haight-Ashbury music scene and had an intense following that started in San Francisco and eventually spread. Fans gathered at their jam concerts throughout the sixties. * 1970s ‚Äì essentially known as the \\"second generation of Deadheads\\", the new Deadheads of this time can either be traced to \\"an older sibling who had turned them on by spinning Workingman's Dead or Europe '72\\" or through college and university dorm rooms. * 1980s ‚Äì The early 1980s brought about what would later become known as \\"Shakedown Street\\" (in reference to the Grateful Dead album of the same name). Starting during the New Year's Eve shows at the Oakland Auditorium in California from 1979 to 1982, Deadheads began to realize they could sell their wares (anything from tie-dye T-shirts to veggie burritos) in order to follow the band around more. Also during the early 1980s, Deadhead tapers grew exponentially, resulting in the band designating a taping section in October 1984.Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip edited by Jake Woodward, et al. Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2003, pg. 263. With the success of their album In the Dark (and the single \\"Touch of Grey\\"), 1988 started the \\"Mega-Dead\\" period.Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip edited by Jake Woodward, et al. Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2003, pg. 315. ** In the Darkers ‚Äì also known as \\"Touchheads\\" (a reference of the album for the former and the single for the latter), these fans \\"dissed the fragile ecosystem\\" of a Grateful Dead show, in the words of Jackson. This led to \\"wiser\\" Deadheads, with the backing of the band, to mail SOSs and hand out show flyers telling people to \\"cool out.\\" ** Minglewood Town Council ‚Äì this group was a direct result of the Touchheads and were a \\"tribal council\\" consisting of Deadheads and the Hog Farmers Calico and Goose. They handed out garbage bags at shows for people to pick up trash afterwards and tried to keep the masses mellow. * 1990s ‚Äì The Deadheads of this time \\"tended to be young, white, male, and from middle-class backgrounds ‚Äì in short, they were drawn from much the same demographic base as most rock fans.\\" The band also tended to attract a large percentage of fans from high- income families. The main draw for these Deadheads to travel to shows seemed to be the sense of community and adventure. During the mid-1990s there were a series of small \\"Deadhead Riots\\" peaking with a large scale riot at the Deer Creek Music Center near Indianapolis in July 1995. The riot was triggered by several gatecrashing incidents, and resulted in the fence at the venue being torn down by rioting Deadheads and the subsequent cancellation of the next day's show. The riot received national attention and is immortalized by Keller Williams in his song \\"Gatecrashers Suck\\", in which he calls the rioters \\"cock- sucking motherfuckers.\\"Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip edited by Jake Woodward, et al. Dorling Kindersley Limited, 2003, pg. 415. * 21st century ‚Äì Many Deadheads of all ages continue to follow Grateful Dead musical incarnations such as The Donna Jean Godchaux Band, RatDog, Phil and Friends, 7 Walkers, The Rhythm Devils, The Dead, Furthur, Dark Star Orchestra, Joe Russo's Almost Dead and Dead & Company. * The Spinners ‚Äì also known as \\"The Family\\" or Church of Unlimited Devotion. These people \\"used the band's music in worship services and were a constant presence at shows.\\" They were called \\"spinners\\" because of their twirling dance style. John Perry Barlow stated at the 'So Many Roads Conference' that the Dead family hadn't realized at the time that the Spinners were a Cult. Observers have reported seeing them spinning only to Jerry songs and sitting down at the songs Bobby performed. Allegations of abuse have circulated widely in Deadhead groups. * Wharf Rats ‚Äì Deadheads who helped each other remain drug and alcohol free while staying in the Dead scene. The Wharf Rats were named from the song of same title. They were allowed to set up a table at every concert to support Dead Heads who believed in enjoying the Grateful Dead sober or needed more efforts to remain straight. * Retread Heads - Enthusiastic fans who were generally too young to have seen the Grateful Dead, but passionately follow the many current Grateful Dead cover bands and spin off bands like Dead & Company. Deadheads are often involved in social and environmental activism. Recordings of shows Bob Weir and Mickey Hart of the Grateful Dead performing on January 20, 2009 at the Mid-Atlantic Inaugural Ball during President Barack Obama's Inaugural At almost every Grateful Dead show, it was common to see fans openly recording the music for later enjoyment. This can be traced to shows in the late 1960s, with the number of tapers increasing yearly. In 1971, Les Kippel, from Brooklyn, New York, started the First Free Underground Grateful Dead Tape Exchange. The purpose of \\"The First Free Underground Grateful Dead Tape Exchange\\" was to preserve the heritage of the Grateful Dead's concert history by exchanging copies of recorded tapes made from audience members. This started a new era in recording, collecting, and trading Grateful Dead tapes. Often referred to as the \\"Original Napster\\", the tape exchange grew into an international movement that continues today. The \\"Tape Exchange\\" evolved into Dead Relix magazine, co-founded by Kippel and its first editor, Jerry Moore (1953‚Äì2009), a native of The Bronx, New York. First fliers were handed out at concerts in 1973, followed by a first issue in 1974. In 1974, Dead Relix evolved into Relix magazine and kept the Grateful Dead in the news while they took a year off in 1975. In 1980, Toni Brown became owner and publisher of Relix. In 2000, it was sold to Steve Bernstein. Relix is the second-oldest continuously published rock magazine in the world, after Rolling Stone. Relix is still the only publication that supports the heritage of the Grateful Dead. There were other Deadhead magazines that came about in the 1970s, notably, Dead in Words and In Concert. The 1980s saw the production of Terrapin Flyer, Dupree's Diamond News, Golden Road, and Acid. Dupree's Diamond News was distributed as an in-concert newsletter at several hundred Grateful Dead concerts, where it averaged 10,000 copies per run. Dupree's Diamond News was also distributed on a quarterly basis as a full-color, 72-page magazine to approximately 35,000 international subscriptions. In 1998, Grateful Dead scholar Johnny Dwork, the founder of Terrapin Flyer and Dupree's Diamond News, published the award-winning, three-volume The Deadhead's Taping Compendium: A Guide to the Music of the Grateful Dead on Tape. Fans were also known to record the many FM radio broadcast shows. Garcia looked kindly on tapers (he himself had been on several cross-country treks to record bluegrass music prior to the Grateful Dead), stating: \\"There's something to be said for being able to record an experience you've liked, or being to obtain a recording of it ... my responsibility to the notes is over after I've played them.\\" In this respect, the Dead are considered by many to be the first \\"taper-friendly\\" band.Garcia: An American Life by Blair Jackson, Penguin Books, 1999, pg. 277. It is a matter of strict custom among Deadheads that these recordings are freely shared and circulated, with no money ever changing hands. Some bootleg recordings from unscrupulous bootleggers have turned up on the black market, but a general \\"code of honor specifically prohibited the buying and selling of Dead tapes.\\" These recordings, sometimes called \\"liberated bootlegs\\", are still frowned upon by the community and that feeling \\"has spread into non- Grateful Dead taping circles.\\" Many Deadheads now freely distribute digital recordings of the band's music, and there are several websites that provide and promote legal access of lossless music. Archives Much Deadhead-related historical material received or collected by the band over the years is housed in the Grateful Dead Archive of UC-Santa Cruz. Archive curator Nicholas Meriwether, who has also written extensively about the culture and its impact on society, states \\"The Grateful Dead archive is going to end up being a critical way for us to approach and understand the 1960s and the counterculture of the era...It's also going to tell us a lot about the growth and development of modern rock theater, and it's helping us understand fan culture.\\" Celebrities The following celebrities have claimed to be Deadheads or have had media reported on them saying they are Deadheads: * Trey Anastasio ‚Äì saw his first Grateful Dead concert in 1980, and the band is a significant influence on his group Phish. * Will Arnett * Steve Bannon * John Belushi like many of the original SNL cast, Belushi went from fan to friend of the band; The Blues Brothers even opened for the Dead and Belushi joined the group in singing \\"U.S. Blues\\". * Tony Blair ‚Äì played in \\"Mars Hotel\\"-inspired student bandturn Mars Hotel upside down & look at it in a Mirror to see name of Blair's band\\" * Jimmy Buffett ‚Äì recorded a version of \\"Scarlet Begonias\\" on the 2004 album \\"License to Chill\\" * Joseph Campbell ‚Äì proclaimed Deadheads as \\"the world's newest tribe.\\"Grateful Dead: The Illustrated Trip edited by Jake Woodward, et al.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) from 1977 to 1989 and 1992 to 2002. He was a Senator for the Administrative Panel from 1989 to 1992. Background Born and raised in Cootehall near Boyle, County Roscommon, he was educated at national level in County Leitrim and then at University College Dublin and King's Inns. In 1965, Doherty became a member of the Garda S√≠och√°na and served as a Detective in Sligo before joining the Special Branch in Dublin in the early 1970s. Doherty came from a family which had a long tradition of public service and political involvement in County Roscommon. In 1973 Doherty took a seat on Roscommon County Council, which was vacant after the death of his father. Doherty married Maura Nangle, who is the sister of Irish musician Carmel Gunning. Together they had four daughters, Rachel Doherty was a councillor on Roscommon County Council. Political career After serving for four years as a local representative on Roscommon County Council, Doherty was elected as a Fianna F√°il TD for the Roscommon‚ÄìLeitrim constituency at the 1977 general election. =Support of Charles Haughey= In 1979, Doherty was a key member of the so-called \\"gang of five\\" which supported Charles Haughey's attempt to take over the leadership of the party. The other members were Albert Reynolds, Mark Killilea Jnr, Tom McEllistrim and Jackie Fahey. Haughey was successful in the leadership contest and Doherty was rewarded by being appointed Minister of State at the Department of Justice from 1979 to 1981. In the short-lived 1982 Fianna F√°il government Doherty entered the Cabinet as Minister for Justice. In this post he became involved in a series of controversies. =Dowra affair= The brother of Se√°n Doherty's wife Maura, Garda Thomas Nangle, was charged with assaulting James McGovern, a native of County Fermanagh, in a public house in December 1981. On 27 September 1982, hours before the case was due to be heard in the District Court in Dowra, a small village in northwest County Cavan, McGovern was arrested by the Special Branch of the RUC on the basis of entirely false Garda intelligence that he was involved in terrorism. The case against Nangle was dismissed because the principal witness, McGovern, failed to appear in court. The solicitor representing Nangle was Kevin Doherty, Se√°n Doherty's brother. This 'questionable' use of Garda/RUC Special Branch liaison, set up under the 1985 Hillsborough Anglo-Irish Agreement, prevented meetings between the Garda commissioner and the RUC chief constable for almost three years. =Phone tapping= After Doherty left office it was revealed in The Irish Times that he ordered the tapping of three journalists' home telephones. The newspaper also disclosed that he had been interfering in the workings of the Garda and the administration of justice for both political and personal reasons. He immediately resigned from the party; however, he rejoined in 1984. At the 1989 general election his lost his seat in D√°il √âireann to the independent candidate Tom Foxe. =Seanad √âireann= He was also an unsuccessful candidate in the elections on the same day to the European Parliament, but he was later elected instead to the Seanad on the Administrative Panel and became the Cathaoirleach (Chairman) of the 19th Seanad. =End of Haughey term= Plaque at the Hells Kitchen Railway Museum (Castlerea). In January 1992 the phone tapping scandal returned to haunt Fianna F√°il. Doherty announced in a television interview that he had shown transcripts of the conversations to Charles Haughey while Haughey was Taoiseach in 1982. Doherty had previously denied this. Haughey denied the claim also, but was forced to resign from the government, and then resigned as leader of Fianna F√°il. Doherty then regained his seat at the 1992 general election and held it until his retirement at the 2002 general election. Death Se√°n Doherty died at Letterkenny General Hospital of a brain haemorrhage on 7 June 2005 while on a family holiday in County Donegal.

Although opposed to the Union blockade of Southern ports, he duly carried out his part of the Anaconda Plan, largely sealing off the Confederate coastline and preventing the exchange of cotton for war supplies. This is viewed as a major cause of Union victory in the Civil War, and his achievement in expanding the Navy almost tenfold was widely praised. Welles was also instrumental in the Navy's creation of the Medal of Honor. Early political career Gideon Welles, the son of Samuel Welles and Ann Hale, was born on July 1, 1802, in Glastonbury, Connecticut. His father was a shipping merchant and fervent Jeffersonian; he was a member of the Convention, which formed the first state Connecticut Constitution in 1818 that abolished the colonial charter and officially severed the pre-American Revolution political ties to England. In contrast to the Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, the successor constitution of 1818 provided for freedom of religion. He was a member of the seventh generation of his family in America. His original immigrant ancestor was Thomas Welles, who arrived in 1635 and was the only man in Connecticut's history to hold all four top offices: governor, deputy governor, treasurer, and secretary. He was also the transcriber of the Fundamental Orders. Welles was the second great grandson of Capt. Samuel Welles and Ruth (Rice) Welles, the daughter of Edmund Rice, a 1638 immigrant to Sudbury and founder of Marlborough, Massachusetts. He married on June 16, 1835, at Lewiston, Mifflin County, Pennsylvania, Mary Jane Hale, who was born on June 18, 1817, in Glastonbury, Connecticut, the daughter of Elias White Hale and Jane Mullhallan. Her father, Elias, graduated from Yale College in 1794 and practiced law in Mifflin and Centre Counties, Pennsylvania. She died on February 28, 1886, in Hartford, Connecticut, and was buried next to her husband in Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford. Gideon and Mary Jane were the parents of six children. He was educated at the Episcopal Academy at Cheshire, Connecticut, and earned a degree at the American Literary, Scientific, and Military Academy at Norwich, Vt. (later Norwich University). He became a lawyer through the then-common practice of reading the law, but soon shifted to journalism and became the founder and editor of the Hartford Times in 1826. After successfully gaining admission, from 1827 to 1835, he participated in the Connecticut House of Representatives as a Democrat. Following his service in the Connecticut General Assembly, he served in various posts, including State Controller of Public Accounts in 1835, Postmaster of Hartford (1836‚Äì41), and Chief of the Bureau of Provisions and Clothing for the Navy (1846‚Äì49). Welles was a Jacksonian Democrat who worked very closely with Martin Van Buren and John Milton Niles. His chief rival in the Connecticut Democratic Party was Isaac Toucey, whom Welles would later replace at the Navy Department. While Welles dutifully supported James K. Polk in the 1844 election, he would abandon the Democrats in 1848 to support Van Buren's Free Soil campaign. Mainly because of his strong anti-slavery views, Welles shifted allegiance in 1854 to the newly established Republican Party and founded a newspaper in 1856 (the Hartford Evening Press) that would espouse Republican ideals for decades thereafter.

Fessenden, Edwin M. Stanton, Abraham Lincoln and William H. Seward takes a swing at the Lincoln administration. Welles' strong support of Abraham Lincoln in the 1860 presidential election made him the logical candidate from New England for Lincoln's cabinet. In March 1861, Lincoln named Welles his Secretary of the Navy. Welles found the Naval Department in disarray, with Southern officers resigning en masse. His first major action was to dispatch the Navy's most powerful warship, the USS Powhatan, to relieve Fort Sumter on Lincoln's instructions. Unfortunately, Secretary of State Seward had just ordered the Powhatan to Fort Pickens, Florida on his own authority, ruining whatever chance Major Robert Anderson had of withstanding the assault. Several weeks later, when Seward argued for a blockade of Southern ports, Welles argued vociferously against the action but was eventually overruled by Lincoln. Despite his misgivings, Welles' efforts to rebuild the Navy and implement the blockade proved extraordinarily effective. From 76 ships and 7,600 sailors in 1861, the Navy expanded almost tenfold by 1865. His implementation of the Naval portion of the Anaconda Plan strongly weakened the Confederacy's ability to finance the war by limiting the cotton trade, and while never completely effective in sealing off all 3,500 miles of Southern coastline, it was a major contribution towards Northern victory. Lincoln nicknamed Welles his \\"Neptune.\\" At the start of the war, David Dixon Porter wrote Welles that \\"the present allowance of crews . . . is for peace establishment and is not suited at all to times of war.\\" On another occasion, Porter told Welles that his own vessel lacked coal and that small steamers of shallow draft were required to make the blockade effective. From Mobile to the Mississippi River, numerous inlets allowed small Confederate craft to slip through the Federal blockade. Despite his successes, Welles was never at ease in the Cabinet. His anti-English sentiments caused him to clash with Seward, and Welles's conservative stances led to arguments with Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase and War Secretary Edwin M. Stanton. After Lincoln's assassination, Welles was retained by President Andrew Johnson as Secretary of the Navy. In 1866, Welles, along with Seward, was instrumental in launching the National Union Party as a third party alternative supportive of Johnson's reconciliation policies. Welles also played a prominent part in Johnson's ill-fated \\"Swing Around the Circle\\" campaign that autumn. Although Welles admitted in his diary that he was dismayed by Johnson's behavior on the trip, particularly the president's penchant for invective and engaging directly with hecklers, Welles remained loyal to Johnson, and supported him during his impeachment.Connecticut History Later life and death Gideon Welles After leaving politics, Welles returned to Connecticut and to writing, editing his journals, and authoring several books before his death, including a biography, Lincoln and Seward, published in 1874. He was a Third Class Companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States. While the Loyal Legion did consist predominantly of Union officers who had served in the American Civil War the Order's constitution provided for honorary members (i.e. Third Class Companions) who were civilians who had made significant contributions to the war effort. Welles was also instrumental in the Navy's creation of the Medal of Honor. Towards the end of 1877, his health began to wane. A streptococcal infection of the throat killed Gideon Welles at the age of seventy-five on February 12, 1878. His body was interred at Cedar Hill Cemetery in Hartford, Connecticut.Gideon Welles at Find A Grave Legacy Two ships have been named USS Welles in his honor. The Dining Commons at Cheshire Academy and the Gideon Welles School in Glastonbury, Connecticut, are also named after him. In the Lincoln Square neighborhood of Chicago, Welles Park was dedicated in honor of Gideon Welles in 1910,Welles Park  Chicago Park District and more recently, an adjacent restaurant, opened in 2014, has also been named after Gideon Welles.

Active throughout the 1990s and up until 2005, the band re-formed in 2011. The Tea Party released eight albums on EMI Music Canada, selling over two million records worldwide, including four double-platinum awards, one platinum and four gold albums in Canada. Between 1996 and 2016, The Tea Party was the 35th best-selling Canadian artist in Canada. The Tea Party toured Canada on 21 occasions and Australia on twelve. In November 2002, the band toured Canada with symphony orchestras reinterpreting a decade's worth of shared songwriting. Breaking up in 2005 due to creative differences, band members nevertheless re-united in 2011 to play several Canadian tour dates during the summer. The band decided to continue after the tour and has now re- formed. The band has since released a double live album, recorded on their 2012 tour of Australia. Video shot during this tour was released as a Live DVD/Blu-ray, The Tea Party: Live from Australia in 2013. In September 2014, The Tea Party released their album, The Ocean at the End, and the following year a deluxe version of their album, The Edges of Twilight. Their 2019 Black River EP is the band's first recording since 2014. The release kicked off a year-long celebration as the band is embarked on their 30th year together. History =Early years (1990‚Äì1995)= The Tea Party was formed in 1990 by Jeff Martin, Stuart Chatwood and Jeff Burrows after a marathon jam session at the Cherry Beach Rehearsal Studios in Toronto. Each member had previously played together during their teenage years in a number of different bands in Windsor, Ontario, where they were originally from. They had decided to name their new group The Tea Party after the infamous hash sessions of famous Beat generation poets Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac and William Burroughs. The Tea Party released their eponymous debut album in 1991, distributing it through their own label Eternal Discs. The album drew influences from psychedelic rock and blues, and was produced by Martin; album production was something Martin would continue with for all of The Tea Party's albums, as a way of giving the band complete artistic control. In 1993 The Tea Party signed to EMI Music Canada and released their first major label recording, Splendor Solis. The band employed open tunings and goblet drums (Dumbek) to create Indian-style sounds, something they continued to employ throughout their career, while continuing in a blues influenced style. In 1994 the album released in Australia, with the single \\"Save Me\\" launching the band's career in the country. The band gained the support of national radio station Triple J, enabling the band's first tour, with \\"Save Me\\" becoming a staple of their setlists.Stuart Chatwood, In Tangents The Tea Party Collection 2000, CD, EMI Music Canada, Mississauga. =Success (1995‚Äì2000)= Further developing The Tea Party's sound in 1995, The Edges of Twilight was recorded with an array of Indian and Middle-eastern instrumentation. \\"Sister Awake\\", the third single from the album, defines what the band set out to do, combining three-piece rock compositions with music from the world. \\"Sister Awake\\" is an acoustically based arrangement on 12-string guitar, sitar, sarod, harmonium and goblet drums. The Edges of Twilight is The Tea Party's most commercially successful album; with sales exceeding 270,000 units, the album is certified double platinum in Canada and platinum in Australia. In 1996, The Tea Party became the first Canadian band to play the main stage at Lollapalooza. Upon returning from successful tours in Canada, Europe and Australia in 1996, The Tea Party recorded Alhambra, an enhanced CD which features acoustic re-recordings of songs from The Edges of Twilight, and followed its release with a brief tour of Canada called \\"Alhambra Acoustic and Eclectic\\". English folk musician Roy Harper appeared on The Edges of Twilight reciting a poem and on Alhambra providing vocals for the song \\"Time\\". Transmission released in 1997 saw The Tea Party's first foray into electronica with a sampled world music foundation and thrust. Transmission is a collection of aggressive songs influenced by upheavals around the band; the firing of their management and the feeling of a lack of support from their record company. Epitomising the feelings were the first single \\"Temptation\\" and the album's title song. Triptych followed in 1999, the first single \\"Heaven Coming Down\\" rose to No. 1 on Canadian radio. The Tea Party's music took on a more orchestral sound, maturing from the blues base. Live at the Enmore Theatre, the band's first live album was released through Australian radio station Triple J during the band's tour for Triptych. In the fall The Tea Party toured in western Canada with Edwin. =Later years (2000‚Äì2005)= The band released a singles compilation called Tangents: The Tea Party Collection in 2000; that year the band was nominated for a Juno award for best musical group. They released a DVD compilation of music videos (which Martin remixed in surround sound) called Illuminations in 2001. It was recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario. The Tea Party released The Interzone Mantras later in 2001,\\"CD REVIEWS: Hayden, Ozzy Osbourne, Sloan, The Tea Party and many more\\". Chart Attack, October 16, 2001, by Debbie Bento and in November 2002 joined symphony orchestras across Canada in adapting their live show. The Interzone Mantras was recorded at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario. Seven Circles was released in 2004. Both The Interzone Mantras and Seven Circles saw the band return to their earlier sound with maturity. In October 2005, The Tea Party disbanded due to creative differences, with Martin abruptly announcing he was beginning a solo career. Afterward Chatwood stated on the band's forum \\"that Jeff Burrows and myself are sincerely sorry for the way this was handled. As far as Jeff Burrows and myself were concerned, the band was taking an extended break.\\"Chatwood, S. 2005, Stuart Chatwood statement. The Tea Party official forum Accessed 15 January 2007. =Post-breakup (2006‚Äì2011)= In 2006 Chatwood continued to compose the Prince of Persia video game soundtracks for Ubisoft Montreal. Burrows joined Rush's Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson, and other Canadian musicians as drummer in the one-off project the Big Dirty Band as well as presenting the midday shift on The Rock, a radio station in Windsor. In 2008 Burrows announced that he, Edwin, Mike Turner and Amir Epstein would form the band Crash Karma, recording their debut album in early 2009.Morano, J 2008, Edwin Forms Band With Ex-Members Of The Tea Party And Our Lady Peace, Chartattack.

In August 2008, Martin announced the formation of his new band, The Armada. In 2010, The Armada broke up. Jeff Martin founded a new band called Jeff Martin 777 with Jay Cortez on bass and Malcolm Clark on drums. Their debut album The Ground Cries Out was released on March 1 in Canada and made it to No. 51 in the Canadian Albums Chart. =Reunion= The Tea Party performing at the Sound of Music Festival in Burlington, ON On 12 April 2011, an official Facebook page was launched with a biography section that closed with \\"The band is scheduled to play a select number of dates in 2011. No other info was available at this time.\\" The following day, the local radio station K106.3 announced the Sarnia Bayfest lineup including The Tea Party, which was later confirmed by drummer Jeff Burrows on his radio show on 13 April. Burrows further stated that a Canadian summer tour was in the works. The band played several shows in Canada over that summer. On 6 August 2011, during a show in L√©vis, the band had implied that they were going to be back together permanently. Martin said \\"We are the Tea Party and we're here to stay. And we're never going away again.\\" In December of that year, during a show at the M√©tropolis in Montreal, the band announced that they would hopefully record a new album in 2012 and that there would be no more break up; Martin confirmed earlier implications by stating that \\"The Tea Party is back for good\\". On 22 February 2013 The Tea Party announced on its website that \\"The band have convened in Australia to write and record the next chapter in the Tea Party saga. Stay tuned for more updates.\\" On 19 March 2014 The Tea Party announced via its Facebook page that the title of their forthcoming album will be The Ocean at the End. It was officially released in Canada on 8 September 2014. In October 2016, the band announced they would be going on a 30 date anniversary tour for their 4th studio album Transmission that was released 20 years ago. The tour began February 3. They performed the album in its entirety along with some of their greatest hits. The Tea Party promoted their Black River EP with two singles, releasing title track \\"Black River\\" in November 2018, followed by \\"Way Way Down\\" in June 2019. The EP released on November 29, 2019 contains both songs along with three new tracks and a Led Zeppelin cover. On April 26, 2020 The Tea Party published a newly recorded cover of Joy Division's \\"Isolation\\" to their YouTube account. It coincided with COVID-19 pandemic isolation orders that much of the world was under to stop the spread of the virus. July 6, 2020 it was made available for digital download on the band's web site. It was followed by a second cover, Everyday Is Like Sunday by Morrissey, made available on streaming music services May 29, 2020. The Tea Party scheduled a cross-country Saints and Sinners Tour 2020 for June and July, featuring Canadian co-headliners Big Wreck, Headstones and Moist. With the COVID-19 pandemic forcing live venues to temporarily close, the tour was rescheduled for the beginning of 2021. Domain name In September 2011, Yahoo! reported that political groups associated with the Tea Party movement were trying to purchase the band's domain name. Stuart Chatwood stated \\"So much damage has been done to our name by the political movement that we're considering selling (The domain)\\" It is estimated the band could sell the domain for over $1M U.S. The band purchased the domain in 1993, and has since added the phrase \\"No politics... Just Rock and Roll\\" to their site in order to distance themselves from the political movement. On October 15, 2011, Sedo announced that they will be exclusively listing the domain for sale on their online marketplace. In February 2012, however, a post appeared on the website's news section that said: \\"The band has not sold teaparty.com.\\" Members * Jeff Martin ‚Äì vocals, guitar, sitar, sarod, oud, banjo, mandolin, dumbek, hurdy-gurdy, esraj, percussion, theremin (1990‚Äì2005, 2011‚Äìpresent) * Stuart Chatwood ‚Äì bass guitar, guitar, keyboard instruments, harmonium, percussion, mandolin, tambura, cello, lap steel guitar, bass pedals (1990‚Äì2005, 2011‚Äìpresent) * Jeff Burrows ‚Äì drum kit, percussion, djembe, goblet drums, tabla (1990‚Äì2005, 2011‚Äìpresent) Discography * The Tea Party (1991) * Splendor Solis (1993) * The Edges of Twilight (1995) * Alhambra (EP) (1996) * Transmission (1997) * Triptych (1999) * The Interzone Mantras (2001) * Seven Circles (2004) * The Ocean at the End (2014) * Black River EP (2019) Awards and Nominations The Tea Party were nominated for 22 MuchMusic Video Awards, and were awarded three People's Choice Awards for Favourite Music Video: two for \\"The River\\" and one for \\"The Bazaar\\". \\"Sister Awake\\" director Curtis Wehrfritz was nominated at the 1996 Juno Awards for Best Director; \\"Release\\" director Ulf Buddensieck won the Best Cinematography Award at the 1998 Juno Awards.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) from 1969 to 1997. Early life and education Barry was born in Blackrock, Cork, in 1928. He was the son of Anthony Barry, a Fine Gael TD and well-known businessman. He was educated at Christian Brothers College, Cork and then became the major shareholder in the family company, Barry's Tea. Political career He was first elected to D√°il √âireann as a Fine Gael TD for the Cork City South-East constituency at the 1969 general election. He would go on to win a D√°il seat at eight successive further general elections, changing constituency to Cork City in 1977 and Cork South-Central in 1981. When Fine Gael came to power following the 1973 general election, he was appointed Minister for Transport and Power. In 1976, he became Minister for Education. In 1979, after Garret FitzGerald had become leader of Fine Gael, Barry was elected deputy leader. From June 1981 to March 1982, he served as Minister for the Environment. From December 1982 to 1987, he was Minister for Foreign Affairs. In this capacity he was heavily involved in the negotiations which resulted in the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement. He also became the first joint chairman of the Anglo-Irish Inter-Governmental Conference, established under the Agreement by the Irish and British governments. Following the Labour Party's withdrawal from the coalition government in 1987, Barry became T√°naiste, for a brief period. He was the first member of Fine Gael to hold the office of T√°naiste. When FitzGerald resigned as Fine Gael leader after the 1987 general election, Barry was one of three candidates (along with Alan Dukes and John Bruton) who contested the party leadership.

The term temazcal comes from the Nahuatl word (\\"house of heat\\"), or possibly from the Nahua words (to bathe) and (house).Aaland, Mikkel. \\"Origin of the Temescal\\". Overview Pictogram of an Aztec temazcal in the Codex Magliabechiano In ancient Mesoamerica it was used as part of a curative ceremony thought to purify the body after exertion such as after a battle or a ceremonial ball game. It was also used for healing the sick, improving health, and for women to give birth. It continues to be used today in Indigenous cultures of Mexico and Central America that were part of the ancient Mesoamerican region for spiritual healing and health enrichment reasons. It is currently being recovered by all sectors of society in Mexico, Central America and the world as a cleansing and restorative balancing of mind, body and spirit. The temazcal is usually a permanent structure, unlike sweat lodges of other regions. It has various construction styles differing by region; from volcanic rock and cement adobe mid bricks even wood mud and cloth can be utilized. It may be a circular dome made to represent the uterus, although rectangular ones have been found at certain archeological sites and this shape is also used. To produce the heat, volcanic stones are heated. Volcanic stones are safe because they do not explode from the temperature. They may be heated with fire from an outside port or placed in a pit located in the center or near a wall of the temazcal.

Named Mount Bachelor because it \\"stands apart\\" from the nearby Three Sisters, it lies in the eastern segment of the central portion of the High Cascades, the eastern segment of the Cascade Range. The volcano lies at the northern end of the long Mount Bachelor Volcanic Chain, which underwent four major eruptive episodes during the Pleistocene and the Holocene. The United States Geological Survey considers Mount Bachelor a moderate threat, but Bachelor poses little threat of becoming an active volcano in the near future. It remains unclear whether the volcano is extinct or just inactive. The Mount Bachelor ski area has operated on the mountain since 1958, and the volcano's summit hosts the Mount Bachelor Observatory. A center of winter recreation, the area offers snowshoeing, snow skiing, snow tubing, and dog sledding, among other activities. The summit can be reached by a climbing trail that travels over lava from the volcano.  Geography  Mount Bachelor lies in the Cascade Range, within Deschutes County, in the U. S. state of Oregon. It is located south of the Three Sisters complex volcano, and reaches an elevation of . It rises above its base, with a proximal relief of . The volcano has a volume of . Mount Bachelor stands southeast of the Tumalo Mountain volcano and to the southwest of the city of Bend, in the Deschutes National Forest. Weather varies greatly in the area due to the rain shadow caused by the Cascade Range. Air from the Pacific Ocean rises over the western slopes, which causes it to cool and dump its moisture as rain (or snow in the winter). Precipitation increases with elevation. Once the moisture is wrung from the air, it descends on the eastern side of the crest, which causes the air to be warmer and drier. On the western slopes, precipitation ranges from annually, while precipitation over the eastern slopes varies from in the east. Temperature extremes reach in summers and during the winters.  Geology  Topographic map of area Mount Bachelor joins several other volcanoes in the eastern segment of the Cascade Range known as the High Cascades, which trends north‚Äìsouth. Constructed towards the end of the Pleistocene Epoch, these mountains are underlain by more ancient volcanoes that subsided due to parallel north‚Äìsouth faulting in the surrounding region. Bachelor lies in the eastern segment of the central portion of the High Cascades. Mount Bachelor is the youngest prominent volcano in the Three Sisters area of Oregon, a group of closely grouped volcanic peaks, in contrast to the typical spacing between volcanoes elsewhere in the Cascades. Among the most active volcanic areas in the Cascades and one of the most densely populated volcanic centers in the world, the Three Sisters region includes peaks such as Belknap Crater, Mount Washington, Black Butte, and Three Fingered Jack to the north, and Broken Top and Mount Bachelor to the south. Most of the surrounding volcanoes consist of mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) lavas; only South and Middle Sister have an abundance of silicic rocks such as andesite, dacite, and rhyodacite. Mafic magma is less viscous; it produces lava flows and is less prone to explosive eruptions than silicic magma. The Mount Bachelor volcanic chain, southeast of South Sister, consists of Mount Bachelor, which is the largest and northernmost volcano of the group, and a series of cinder cones, lava flows, and three shield volcanoes. The chain runs for and encompasses an area of about , trending from north to south. Its volcanoes show significant variation in size and shape, ranging from steep cones produced by mild explosive activity to the gently sloping profiles of shield volcanoes. Volcanic vents within the locale show north‚Äìnorthwest‚Äìnorth‚Äìnortheast-trending trends, which correspond to normal faults (where one side of the fault moves downward relative to the other) in the region, including one at the Bachelor chain's southern end. The Bachelor chain shows that much of the Quaternary Cascades in Oregon were produced in short bursts of eruptive activity and that mafic shield volcanoes can erupt at equal rates to stratovolcanoes. The volcanoes within the field are fed by shallow, compartmentalized magma chambers. A stratovolcano (atop a shield volcano with a symmetrical shape), Mount Bachelor formed between 18,000 and 8,000 years ago. Bachelor is composed of basalt and basaltic andesite, and though its upper volcanic cone formed after its base shield, the two edifices show similar eruptive composition. The mountain has withstood very little alteration as a result of glacial erosion besides a small cirque (an amphitheatre-like valley formed by glacial erosion) on the northern side of the volcano. Despite the small scale of this erosion, it has extensively altered the northern face of Mount Bachelor, breaking down its lava into fine powder, particularly at the glacier terminus, where the terminal moraine resembles dust. However, the volcano's glacier has shrunk in recent decades and may vanish as a result of the warming climate. The volcano's summit has a number of clustered, northwest‚Äìsoutheast-trending vents, which erupted block lava flows made of basalt and andesite and only exhibited minor explosive eruptions, as little tephra can be found near the vents at the summit; there is also little pyroclastic rock. There is no summit crater. Lava flows from Mount Bachelor's summit feature phenocrysts including clinopyroxene, olivine (more rare), and plagioclase, with two phases for the clinopyroxene featuring augite and pigeonite. Textures for these eruptive products vary from intersectal to intergranular, seriate to glomeroporphyritic to subophitic, and trachytic to non-aligned. Bachelor last erupted between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago, and is entirely covered with Mazama Ash from the catastrophic eruption of Mount Mazama about 6,845 years ago. There is no geothermal activity at present, though some areas popularly thought to be fumaroles are caused by air movement through the porous structure. Several are near the top of the Pine Marten chairlift and occasionally present a hazard to skiers and snowboarders where the snow is undermined. = Subfeatures = Mount Bachelor is associated with a number of pyroclastic cones and shield volcanoes. Nearby cones include Dry Butte, Klak Butte, Lolah Butte, Lolo Butte, Lumrun Butte, Pistol Butte, Red Crater, Siah Butte, Sitkum Butte, Three Trappers, Tot Mountain, and Wake Butte. Shield volcanoes within the vicinity of Bachelor include Sheridan Mountain, Lookout Mountain, and Kwohl Butte.  Eruptive history  The Mount Bachelor Chain has shown activity during the Pleistocene and the Holocene, mostly consisting of effusive eruptions with a small number of explosive eruptions yielding agglutinate spatter cones, volcanic bombs, and scoria. Within the Bachelor chain, mafic (rich in magnesium and iron) eruptive activity consisting mostly of lava flows and tephra fall took place over four discrete periods, beginning approximately 18,000 to 15,000 years ago as a Pleistocene glacier in the area began to retreat. During this first eruptive episode, the majority of activity occurred in the center of the chain, forming the Sheridan Mountain shield volcano. The first vents to erupt, subglacial volcanoes beneath an ice sheet west of Sparks Lake in the northwestern segment of the chain, interacted with water to produce violent explosive eruptions that ejected pyroclastic rock, which was deposited into the lakebed. Hyaloclastite deposits and thick lava flows with ice also formed in this area, along with the Talapus and Katsuk Buttes from scoria produced by later, milder Strombolian eruptions (which eject incandescent cinder, lapilli, and volcanic bombs). The second eruptive period consisted of explosive eruptions, which constructed scoria cones and lava flows to the south of Sheridan Mountain, known as the Siah Butte vents. These extend to the south end of the chain. The third period produced the shield volcano beneath Mount Bachelor out of basaltic andesite, later constructing its summit, in addition to a shield volcano that is topped by the Kwohl Butte.  ªA ªƒÅ lava erupted from Mount Bachelor during this third period coursed down its northern and northwestern sides. By 12,000 years ago, Mount Bachelor was close to its current size, as the oldest moraines from glaciers on the mountain (which are covered by lava flows from this third eruptive episode) can be dated to this time period. The current edifice at Mount Bachelor had been finished by about 10,000 years ago, followed by a gap in eruptive activity that lasted for 2,000 years. The latest eruptive activity within the chain yielded scoria cones and lava flows, including the Egan cone, which can be observed on Mount Bachelor's lower northern flank. Due to the presence of Mazama Ash on the northern side of the volcano, no eruptive activity is likely to have happened since 7,700 years ago. In total, the Mount Bachelor chain has produced of eruptive material, including Mount Bachelor's volume at . Stratigraphic and paleomagnetic studies suggest that Bachelor's volume was produced in as little as 1,500 years. = Potential hazards = Listed at a \\"moderate\\" threat level by the United States Geological Survey, Mount Bachelor poses little threat of becoming an active volcano in the near future. It may be part of a monogenetic volcanic field, meaning that the volcano only underwent one long series of eruptions before stopping activity altogether, but it may just be inactive, and it could erupt in the future. It remains unclear whether Mount Bachelor is merely dormant or whether it is completely extinct. The Bachelor volcanic chain lies within a lava flow hazard zone that exists in central Oregon, and eruptions from this field of mafic volcanoes may produce eruptions of tephra and lava flows extending for from their source vents. Within areas of the vents, tephra may form deposits with thicknesses of up to , though they only reach thicknesses of at further distances beyond . Because lava flows move slowly, they can be outmaneuvered by animals and humans, though they do pose a threat to streams and rivers, which they may dam or divert, leading to potential flood risks. If Mount Bachelor were to erupt, it would significantly affect the ski industry on the volcano, endangering visitors. An eruption from Mount Bachelor, the Three Sisters to the north, or another nearby vent in the Mount Bachelor Chain may be unlikely, but any would pose threats to the ski area.  Human history  Mount Bachelor is so called because it \\"stands apart\\" from the Three Sisters, a group of three volcanic mountains that are northwest of Mount Bachelor. In early days Bachelor Butte was frequently called \\"Brother Jonathan\\", or \\"Mount Brother\\", but both eventually fell out of use. Around the time of World War II, 90,000 soldiers were stationed to train at Camp Abbot near Bend. During the war, Bend's community depended on sawmills and agriculture, with a small ski area opening at Mount Bachelor in 1941. In 1950, the Shevlin-Hixon mill closed, leaving hundreds unemployed before it was re- expanded several years later. By 1958, the ski hill had grown into a ski resort, after the fundraising of start-up costs by the Bend Skyliners Mountaineering Club, with the installation of the first chair lift in 1962 and the attainment of a 30-year special use permit from the United States Forest Service. Expansion continued into the 1970s, with the ski area receiving 257,000 visitors between 1974 and 1975, and more than 500,000 between 1982 and 1983. The resort developers were concerned that skiing on a butte might be perceived by consumers as \\"small-time\\" and so named their resort Mount Bachelor. Over time the popularity of the ski area led to the name Mount Bachelor coming into popular usage, and in a divided decision, the Oregon Geographic Names Board voted to change the name from Bachelor Butte to Mount Bachelor. In the 1980s, struggles of the homebuilding and lumber industries meant that Deschutes County saw a 15 percent unemployment rate, but construction of a local mall, a chair to the top of Mount Bachelor, and the High Desert Museum helped the economy improve with time. In 2013, the United States Forest Service approved a new master plan for further development of the resort, including a mountain bike park, more chair lifts, more trails, a zip line, and improved lodge amenities. The volcano's summit hosts the Mount Bachelor Observatory, located at an elevation of above sea level, and maintained by a research group at the University of Washington Bothell and the ski resort. Research at the observatory investigates long-range transport of pollution from the Asian continent, measuring chemical features of plumes that reach the Pacific Northwest.  Recreation  The chair lift to Mount Bachelor's summit, as seen in 1986 Mount Bachelor ski area operates a chairlift during the summer as well as during the ski season (weather permitting), making it the only major Cascade volcano with a chairlift to the summit. Nationally known, the resort is one of the largest in the Pacific Northwest with a skiable area of and a vertical drop of , in addition to six terrain parks. The resort represents a center of winter recreational activities within Deschutes County, operating within the Deschutes National Forest and partnering with the United States Forest Service to offer activities while preserving the Oregon Cascades and the forest area. The resort offers interpretive tours with a naturalist on local flora and fauna, in addition to snowshoeing, snowboarding, snow tubing, dog sledding, and department stores. During the summer, fishing is a popular activity in the local lakes and streams, as is hiking and camping. Climbing to the top of Mount Bachelor follows a trail that begins at an elevation of and gains to reach the summit. A single-track trail, it traverses over lava from the volcano, which appears in jagged formations. The volcano's summit offers views of the rest of the Mount Bachelor chain to the south, in addition to Lookout Mountain, the Three Sisters, Mount Jefferson, Mount Hood, and Mount Adams in Washington state.

The 83rd edition of the World Series, it was a best-of- seven playoff played between the National League (NL) champion New York Mets and the American League (AL) champion Boston Red Sox. The Mets won the Series in the seventh game, after overcoming a deficit of two runs with two outs and no one on base in the bottom of the 10th inning of Game 6\\\\. This was a game in which the Red Sox were twice one strike away from victory, and known for the famous error by Boston's first baseman Bill Buckner after their lead had already been blown. Game 6 has been cited in the legend of the \\"Curse of the Bambino\\" to explain the major comeback. The 1986 World Series marked the second time in which that team lost the first two games of the series at home (it had first happened in the previous year's World Series). It was also the first World Series to use the designated hitter only in games played at the American League representative's stadium, a policy which has continued since (prior to this, since 1976, the DH would be used in all parks in the World Series for even-numbered years, but in odd-numbered years, the DH rule would not be in effect). Background =New York Mets= The New York Mets finished the regular season with a franchise-best record of 108‚Äì54, winning the National League East division by games over the division rival Philadelphia Phillies. They then won a tightly contested 1986 National League Championship Series against the Houston Astros, 4 games to 2, clinching the series with a 7-6, 16-inning win in Game 6\\\\. On July 19, Mets' infielder Tim Teufel and pitchers Rick Aguilera, Bobby Ojeda, and Ron Darling were arrested after fighting with policemen outside a bar in Houston. Just three days later, the Mets played a game in Cincinnati that saw Ray Knight, Darryl Strawberry, and Kevin Mitchell get ejected, forcing starting catcher Gary Carter to play third base and the Mets to play a pitcher in the outfield, with lefty Jesse Orosco and right-hander Roger McDowell alternating between the pitcher's mound and the outfield as needed. Despite the adversity, the Mets won the game, 6-3 in 14 innings, on a three-run homer by Howard Johnson. =Boston Red Sox= Boston went 95‚Äì66 during the season, winning the American League East division by games over their biggest nemesis, the New York Yankees. The gritty play of eventual ALCS MVP Marty Barrett and Rich Gedman; clutch hitting from veterans Jim Rice, Wade Boggs, Don Baylor, Dwight Evans and Dave Henderson; and quality starting pitching, especially from 1986 American League MVP and Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens, Bruce Hurst and Oil Can Boyd, pushed the Red Sox to the World Series. The team's defining moment occurred in Game 5 of the 1986 American League Championship Series against the California Angels. With the Angels leading three games to one in the best-of-seven series and their top reliever Donnie Moore on the mound, the Sox needed a last-out miracle home run from Henderson to survive Game 5; they later loaded the bases and got the go- ahead run on a sacrifice fly from Henderson off Moore in the 11th. The Angels never recovered from this blow, and with Boston capitalizing on some defensive miscues by the Angels, and clutch performances by some of their big name players (namely Rice and Clemens in the deciding game), the Red Sox clinched the pennant with a seven-game series win. Summary ‚Ä†: postponed from October 26 due to rain Matchups =Game 1= Calvin Schiraldi Just as they did against Houston in the National League Championship Series, the Mets opened the World Series by taking a 1‚Äì0 defeat. Boston's Bruce Hurst dominated the Mets with his forkball and looping curve, allowing only four hits over eight innings to get the win. In the bottom of the sixth, Hurst got Ray Knight to ground into an inning-ending double play and thwart a scoring opportunity for the Mets. New York's Ron Darling was equally effective, yielding only one unearned run in the seventh inning when second baseman Tim Teufel committed an error by letting a ground ball from Rich Gedman go through his legs, allowing Jim Rice to score from second. Red Sox closer (and former Met) Calvin Schiraldi walked Darryl Strawberry to lead off the bottom of the ninth inning. However, Schiraldi got Knight to force out Strawberry at second base and then got Wally Backman to fly out to left field. With two outs, Danny Heep pinch hit for Rafael Santana. Schiraldi worked Heep to a 2‚Äì2 count and then struck him out swinging to solidify the victory. Mets' legend Tom Seaver, now a member of the Red Sox, received a standing ovation from the Shea Stadium fans during the Game 1 introductions. Seaver did not pitch in the series because of a knee injury. =Game 2= Wade Boggs Game 2 figured to be a classic pitching matchup, between the Mets' young phenom Dwight Gooden and Boston's own young pitching sensation Roger Clemens, but neither pitcher went beyond five innings. The Red Sox scored first in the top of the third inning, following a leadoff walk to Spike Owen, when Keith Hernandez fielded a Clemens bunt, but threw it away trying to catch Owen at second base. Wade Boggs then drove in Owen with a double, Marty Barrett drove in Clemens with a single, and Bill Buckner drove in Boggs with a single to give the Sox a 3‚Äì0 lead. In the bottom half of the inning, the Mets had on second and third base for Wally Backman, who grounded up the middle, plating Rafael Santana. Hernandez then grounded out, allowing Gooden to score and bring the Mets within one run. In the top of the fourth inning, Dave Henderson, the hero of the ALCS, drove the second pitch from Gooden to left-center field for a home run. Dwight Evans followed with a two-run home run in the top of the fifth inning, bringing the score to 6‚Äì2. Although Clemens had a comfortable lead going into the bottom of the fifth, he was pulled in favor of Steve Crawford after facing three batters, leaving runners on first and third. Crawford promptly gave up a single to Gary Carter that scored Backman, cutting the deficit to three runs. Crawford struck out Darryl Strawberry and got Danny Heep to ground out, but this left Clemens with a no decision. Gooden was relieved by Rick Aguilera in the sixth inning. Aguilera loaded the bases in the seventh, and after consecutive RBI singles by Henderson and Owen, was pulled in favor of Jesse Orosco, who shut down the Red Sox over the next two innings. The Red Sox were not done, however. Facing Sid Fernandez, pitching in relief with runners on first and second base in the ninth inning, Boggs drove in Henderson with a double to make the score 9‚Äì3. The Mets were unable to recover from this deficit, and took the loss, giving Boston a 2‚Äì0 advantage heading to Fenway Park. =Game 3= Bob Ojeda The Mets started well when Lenny Dykstra led off the game with a home run. After two singles, Gary Carter followed with an RBI double, and Danny Heep drove in two runners with a single to give the Mets a 4‚Äì0 lead in the first inning. After the rocky start, Red Sox starter Oil Can Boyd settled down, but Bob Ojeda pitched well and Boston was unable to overcome their early deficit. In his first at bat of the World Series, Boston's Don Baylor almost homered in the second inning but hit the Green Monster, resulting in a double. Ojeda gave up an RBI single to Marty Barrett in the bottom of the third inning, but this would be the only Boston run of the game. Carter drove in two runners with a bases-loaded single in the seventh inning, and Ray Knight drove in Darryl Strawberry, who had singled and moved to third on two wild pitches, with a double in the eighth inning off of Joe Sambito. Roger McDowell pitched the final two frames to seal a 7‚Äì1 Mets victory. =Game 4= Gary Carter Ron Darling faced off against Boston's Al Nipper, as the Mets looked to tie the Series. Neither starter allowed a run until the top of the fourth inning, when Gary Carter ripped a two-run home run over the Green Monster and Ray Knight drove in Darryl Strawberry, who had doubled after the home run, with a single. Lenny Dykstra hit a two-run home run of his own in the top of the seventh inning, and Carter hit a shot in the top of the eighth inning, both off of Steve Crawford. In the eighth inning, the Red Sox scored two runs on a Dwight Evans single and a Dave Henderson sacrifice fly off of Roger McDowell, but it was not enough, and the Mets evened the series at two games apiece to ensure a return to New York. =Game 5= Marty Barrett The Red Sox struck first in the second when Dave Henderson tripled with one out off of Dwight Gooden and scored on Spike Owen's sacrifice fly. Dwight Evans's RBI single next inning with two on made it 2‚Äì0 Red Sox. In the fifth, Jim Rice hit a leadoff triple and scored on Don Baylor's single. After Evans singled, Sid Fernandez relieved Gooden and allowed an RBI double to Henderson. Bruce Hurst pitched shutout innings before Tim Teufel's home run in the eighth put the Mets on the board. In the ninth, Mookie Wilson doubled with two outs and scored on Rafael Santana's single before Hurst struck out Lenny Dykstra to end the game as the Red Sox's 4‚Äì2 gave them a 3‚Äì2 series lead heading back to New York. =Game 6= In Game 6, Boston took a quick 2‚Äì0 lead on RBI base hits from Dwight Evans and Marty Barrett. The Mets tied the score in the fifth inning on a single from Ray Knight and a run-scoring double play by Danny Heep, in his last at-bat as a Met. In the sixth inning, the Mets had a chance to take the lead, but back-to-back hits by Wally Backman and Keith Hernandez were to no avail, when Gary Carter struck out with Backman on third and only one out and Darryl Strawberry grounded out. Instead, it was the Red Sox who would go ahead, when an error by Knight led to Barrett scoring in the seventh to give Boston a 3-2 lead. This go-ahead run for the Red Sox scored on a groundout by Dwight Evans to second, which could have resulted in an inning-ending double play with the game still tied 2-2. However, Red Sox manager John McNamara had put a hit-and-run play on, which led to Jim Rice being safe at second. Thus, the relay throw from Kevin Elster (who had entered the game at shortstop after Rafael Santana had been pinch-hit for) to first was only the second out of the inning and allowed the Red Sox‚Äô go-ahead run to score. Boston then came close to extending its lead, when the next batter, catcher Rich Gedman, singled. However, Rice (the runner who had been safe at second on the previous play) was thrown out at the plate by Mets left fielder Mookie Wilson to keep the score at 3-2 Boston. In the top of the eighth, the Red Sox had Dave Henderson on second with one out. Manager John McNamara sent rookie Mike Greenwell to pinch hit for Roger Clemens in an effort to match Greenwell, a left-handed batter, against the Mets' dominant short-relief man Roger McDowell even as righty slugger Don Baylor sat on the bench; Greenwell struck out and the Sox scored no runs that inning, after loading the bases with two two-out walks (one intentional) and a flyout to center by Bill Buckner on the first pitch of his at-bat. It was initially said that Clemens was removed from the game due to a blister forming on one of his fingers, but both he and McNamara dispute this. Clemens said to Bob Costas on an MLB Network program concerning the 1986 postseason that McNamara decided to pull him despite Clemens wanting to pitch. McNamara said to Costas that Clemens \\"begged out\\" of the game.^ 1986: A Postseason To Remember, MLB Network, 2011 Bob Stanley Bill Buckner Regardless of who was telling the truth, McNamara had been warming closer Calvin Schiraldi in the bullpen for some time and brought him in the bottom of the eighth inning for a potential two-inning save. Lee Mazzilli, pinch hitting for Jesse Orosco, who had recorded the final out of the eighth, led off the inning with a single. Lenny Dykstra then reached on an attempted sacrifice to put two runners on. Wally Backman followed with another bunt to move Mazzilli and Dykstra into scoring position, and Schiraldi intentionally walked Keith Hernandez to load the bases for Gary Carter. Schiraldi ran up a 3-0 count on Carter, but Carter swung at the next pitch and flied to left, deep enough to score Mazzilli and tie the game. With Dykstra now on third, Darryl Strawberry stood in with a chance to drive in the go-ahead run, but flied out to end the inning. After the Red Sox failed to score against Rick Aguilera in the top of the ninth, the Mets came up with a chance to win the game. Ray Knight started the inning by drawing a walk off Schiraldi. Mookie Wilson was then asked to lay down a bunt to try to move the runner up to second. The bunt landed directly in front of home plate and Red Sox catcher Rich Gedman saw he had a play at second and threw there to try and get the lead runner. His throw was high, however, and pulled shortstop Spike Owen off the base long enough for Knight to slide in safely. Owen, Barrett, and McNamara argued that second base umpire Jim Evans made the wrong call, with McNamara saying he could not have seen Owen's foot land back on the bag, but television replays showed that Knight's hand touched just before Owen got his foot back down. With a runner now in scoring position and still nobody out, Howard Johnson came on to pinch hit for Kevin Elster. Boston again expected a bunt attempt, but manager Davey Johnson did not call for one and Johnson would eventually strike out. Schiraldi then got Mazzilli, who stayed in the game as a defensive replacement for Strawberry, and Dykstra on back to back flyouts to Jim Rice to end the inning. In the visiting tenth, Henderson hit Aguilera's second pitch of the inning out of the park for a 4-3 Boston lead. After getting Owen to strike out, the first of two opportunities for McNamara to utilize his bench, where he had several pinch-hitting options including Baylor still available, came up with the pitcher's spot now due. McNamara, however, sent Schiraldi to the plate despite having both Joe Sambito and Bob Stanley, the latter having not recorded a single earned run in the postseason to that point, in the bullpen ready to go. Aguilera would retire Schiraldi on a strikeout for the second out. Wade Boggs then followed with a double, and Barrett drove him in with a single to give the Red Sox an insurance run and a 5-3 lead. The second chance for McNamara to use his bench followed. Bill Buckner was the next batter, and in many cases where Boston would be leading late in games McNamara would take Buckner out and replace him with Dave Stapleton at first base, as he had done in all three previous Red Sox victories in this series. This time, he did not, even after Aguilera drilled the veteran first baseman in the hip with a pitch. Rice, the next batter, ended the inning with a flyout to Mazzilli. When asked later about his decision to leave Buckner in the game, McNamara initially said that he felt that he deserved to stay on the field for the potential final out to preserve the victory and the championship. Buckner, after all, was the third-oldest Red Sox player behind Baylor and Tom Seaver, who was not on the postseason roster, and was an 18-year veteran who had only seen action in one prior World Series, which came when he was a member of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1974 World Series. Years later, McNamara changed his story and said that the reason why had nothing to do with sentimentality and instead said that Stapleton, who said McNamara's decision cost the Red Sox the series, was not a reliable defender and that his teammates had taken to calling him \\"Shaky\\" as a result;^ 1986: A Postseason To Remember, MLB Network, 2011 in spite of McNamara's assertion, Stapleton had only committed one error at first base since Buckner joined the Red Sox in 1984 and, in his last two full seasons at first base, had recorded fielding percentages of .991 and .992 respectively.https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/staplda01.shtml Needing to rally for the second time in three innings, and now having to overcome a two-run deficit, the Mets' first two batters in the tenth went quietly against Schiraldi. Backman flew out to left, and Keith Hernandez flew out to center. With Carter now New York's last hope, the words \\"Congratulations Boston Red Sox, 1986 World Champions\\" briefly and accidentally flashed on the scoreboard.Deane, Bill, Baseball Myths: Debating, Debunking, and Disproving Tales from the Diamond 174 (2012). The celebration would be put on hold as Carter singled to bring the tying run to the plate. Had he not come out in the ninth inning, Strawberry would have been the next batter. Because of the double switch, the pitcher took his spot in the lineup and Aguilera was due up. Johnson had decided to send rookie utility man Kevin Mitchell up to pinch hit for the young reliever, who was at the moment the pitcher of record. Mitchell, however, was not in the dugout. It has been said (and later denied by Mitchell) that since he believed the game was over after Hernandez flew out, the rookie went back into the clubhouse and took his uniform off, deciding to get a head start on booking a flight back home. Someone had to be sent into the clubhouse to get him, and Mitchell had to rush to get his uniform back on to come and take his at bat. Despite the rush, the rookie utility man came through with a single of his own, advancing Carter to second and putting the tying runs on base with Knight, now the potential winning run, coming up. Schiraldi got two quick strikes on the Mets' third baseman, who had already driven in one run so far. However, with his team within one strike of that elusive championship, he could not finish the job as Knight singled to left-center. Carter scored from second standing up and the speedy Mitchell advanced to third. Finally, McNamara decided his closer had seen enough and called for the veteran Stanley to try to close out the game. Some later speculated as to why Stanley, who had been warmed up by the time the tenth inning began, had not been called upon earlier instead of McNamara asking for a third inning out of Schiraldi, who had already blown the save. The Mets' next batter was Wilson, who had recorded one hit and reached on a fielder's choice after the bad throw by Gedman in the ninth. Six pitches into the at-bat, with the count even at two balls and two strikes, Stanley threw a breaking ball that broke sharply inside and bounced in front of Wilson, who fell down trying to avoid it. Gedman tried to field the ball but could not, and it rolled to the backstop. From his knees, Wilson signaled to Mitchell to come down from third and he scored easily, tying the score at five. Knight advanced to second on the wild pitch. Several times during the ensuing series of pitches, second baseman Barrett realized that Knight was straying too far from the base and that if he could get Stanley to turn and throw to him, he would have an easy pickoff play and the inning could have ended there. Despite his best attempts, Barrett never was able to get Stanley to hear him as the sellout crowd at Shea Stadium was drowning him out, and Stanley instead chose to focus on getting Wilson out. On the tenth pitch of the at-bat, Stanley finally got Wilson to put the ball in play, forcing a ground ball to first base. Veteran first baseman Bill Buckner, who was playing on the lip of the infield to protect against a hit through the first-second base hole, moved over to the foul line to try to field the ball, but it rolled between his legs and into right field. Knight rounded third and scored without a play, and the Mets tied the series at three with their 6-5 victory. In the 2011 ESPN Films documentary Catching Hell, Buckner explained how, years after the event, he realized from watching a television replay how he had missed the ball. He said, when he played in the field, he liked to wear a very loose glove ‚Äî i.e., one that was floppy. When he moved to his left to try to field Wilson's grounder and then stopped, the momentum of the leftward-moving loose glove caused the glove to close. The ball then went just past the right side of the glove.Catching Hell. From YouTube. The pertinent part is at the 1:28:58 to 1:30:33 of the video. Retrieved on October 31, 2015. After the top of the tenth, NBC began setting up in the visiting clubhouse for what they believed was the inevitable postgame victory celebration. The Commissioner's Trophy had been brought into the Red Sox clubhouse along with several bottles of champagne, and Bob Costas was to preside over the presentation. However, after Stanley's wild pitch in the bottom of the tenth, everything was quickly struck and removed from the room before the Red Sox returned. Costas later recalled the removal of all the equipment for the postgame celebration as being \\"like a scene change in a Broadway musical. In, out, gone, not a trace.\\" In 2011, MLB Network ranked this as the third greatest game of the preceding 50 years. =Game 7= In the hours that followed the end of Game 6, a rainstorm passed over the New York metropolitan area. The field at Shea Stadium was inundated with water and, thus, Major League Baseball was forced to reschedule Game 7 for the next night, October 27. Ron Darling was the scheduled starter for the Mets, who were employing a three-man rotation for the series consisting of him, Dwight Gooden, and Bob Ojeda. In his two starts so far in the series, Darling had a 1-1 record with an earned-run average of 0.00; the only run he had given up, which resulted in his Game 1 loss against Bruce Hurst, was unearned. The rainout gave him an extra day off, so he would be pitching on his normal four-day rest. Oil Can Boyd, the #3 starter for the Red Sox, was originally scheduled to start Game 7. The Mets had gotten to him early in Game 3, which they won 7-1 to record their first win of the series. Boyd gave up four runs in the first inning of Game 3 and six overall despite pitching into the seventh, getting only one run of support in the loss. The unscheduled day off, however, allowed Red Sox manager John McNamara to reconsider his pitching matchup for the deciding game of the series. Hurst, who was set to be awarded the Most Valuable Player award had the Red Sox been able to close out Game 6 with a victory, had gotten a third day of rest with the rainout; with this in mind, and considering that the Mets had only scored twice off of Hurst in his seventeen total innings of work in Games 1 and 5, McNamara decided to gamble on his postseason hero and gave Hurst the Game 7 nod. After Boyd received word he was not starting the final game of the series, he went down into the visitors' clubhouse and remained in there alone for some time. McNamara dispatched pitching coach Bill Fischer to find Boyd, and Fischer discovered that the Oil Can had consumed a great deal of alcohol and was in no condition to function much less play. Fischer moved Boyd into the manager's office where he locked the door and left him for the entire game. Boston got to Darling early, recording three runs in the second inning. Dwight Evans and Rich Gedman hit back to back home runs to lead the inning off and with two out, Wade Boggs drove in Dave Henderson with a single for a 3‚Äì0 Red Sox lead. Gedman‚Äôs home run was noteworthy for several reasons: It occurred on the first pitch after a delay of just over three minutes during which portable stands down the first base line had to be restored after several fans reaching for a foul ball had caused them to collapse. The subsequent pitch by Darling, which came on a two- strike count (1-2), led to Gedman‚Äôs home run. However, the ball was almost caught by Darryl Strawberry, who was reaching over the right-field wall. Fortunately for the Red Sox, the ball would not stay in the webbing of Strawberry‚Äôs glove and cleared the fence for a 2-0 Boston lead. If Strawberry had recorded the out, the inning may have ended with only one Boston run instead of three, as three batters later, Red Sox pitcher Bruce Hurst would have stepped to the plate to bat with two outs instead of in a sacrifice situation, which he successfully converted to set up Boggs‚Äô run-scoring hit. The Mets, meanwhile, could not muster much against Hurst and through three innings had only recorded one hit. In the fourth Henderson reached after Darling hit him with a pitch. After Spike Owen flew out, Hurst laid down a bunt that moved Henderson into scoring position. Mets manager Davey Johnson then lifted Darling from the game and brought in Sid Fernandez to face Boggs and the leading hitter of the series, Marty Barrett. Boggs managed to draw a walk, but Fernandez retired Barrett on a fly ball to right field to end the inning. The Mets still did not have an answer for Hurst through the fourth and fifth innings, going down in order in both frames. The Red Sox, conversely, went down in order against Fernandez in the fifth and sixth, which kept the deficit at three. In the bottom of the inning, the Mets were finally able to break through against their series nemesis and turn the tide in their favor. After Hurst got the first out when Rafael Santana grounded out, Lee Mazzilli came up to pinch-hit for Fernandez and singled. Mookie Wilson followed with a single of his own, and second baseman Tim Teufel drew a walk to load the bases. Keith Hernandez then drove the lead runners in with a single, and Wally Backman came in to run for Teufel representing the tying run. Gary Carter was the next batter and he lifted a fly ball to Evans in right. The veteran outfielder had to dive in order to catch it, and was unable to come up with the catch. Right field umpire Dale Ford did not immediately rule that there was no catch, which crossed up Hernandez on the basepath; since the ball was ruled to be in play, he had to attempt to advance to second base. Since there was a delay in the ruling, Evans was able to throw back into the infield and force out Hernandez at second. Beckman managed to score on the play to tie the game, but the Mets lost a chance to have Darryl Strawberry come up with a chance to drive in the go ahead run; instead, Hurst got him to fly out and escaped further damage. Hurst would be lifted for a pinch hitter after this inning. Ray Knight Roger McDowell entered the game for the Mets in the seventh and retired pinch-hitter Tony Armas, Boggs, and Barrett in order. McNamara called upon Game 6 loser Calvin Schiraldi to pitch the home half of the inning, despite his struggles in the extended outing he had two nights earlier. The day of rest did not help, as he immediately surrendered a home run to Ray Knight leading off. Lenny Dykstra came up as a pinch-hitter and singled, then advanced to second on a wild pitch and scored on a single by Santana. After McDowell successfully moved Santana into scoring position, McNamara decided to take the ball from Schiraldi and brought in Joe Sambito. After putting Wilson on intentionally, Sambito walked Backman to load the bases and Hernandez followed with a sacrifice fly to score Santana and give the Mets a three-run advantage. Bob Stanley recorded the final out by getting Carter to ground out to Owen at shortstop. Down to their last six outs, Boston had not had a runner reach base since Boggs' walk in the fourth inning. Jim Rice had recorded the last Red Sox hit, a single in the third, but had been thrown out trying to stretch it into a double. They tried to rally against McDowell in the eighth and Bill Buckner led the inning off with a single. Rice followed with another single, and Evans doubled after that to make the score 6-5 and bring Gedman to the plate with the potential go-ahead run. Needing to stop the rally, Johnson pulled McDowell in favor of his closer Jesse Orosco to face the Red Sox catcher. After inducing a line drive to second that Backman caught for the first out, Orosco struck out Henderson for the second out and then got Don Baylor, batting for Owen, to ground out and end the Boston rally. In the bottom of the eighth, the Mets finally were able to put the game away at the expense of Game 4 loser Al Nipper. Strawberry led the inning off with a solo home run, and Knight singled and advanced to second on a groundout by Dykstra. Santana was intentionally walked to get to the pitcher's spot, but Orosco not only came to bat but also managed to drive Knight in as he swung away on a fake bunt attempt to extend the lead back to three. Steve Crawford then came in to face Wilson and hit him, loading the bases. Backman then grounded into a force retiring Santana, and Hernandez grounded out and ended the inning. Staked to an 8-5 lead, Orosco faced Ed Romero, who took over at shortstop for Owen in the eighth, to start the top of the ninth and retired him on a foul pop. Boggs then grounded out to Backman at second, leaving Barrett as the last hope for the Red Sox. Orosco worked a 2-2 count before getting Barrett to swing and miss, then tossed his glove high into the air and dropped to his knees as the Mets all converged on the mound to celebrate their world championship victory. McDowell was awarded the victory, with Orosco garnering his second save of the series. Schiraldi was saddled with the loss for the second consecutive game, having been charged with all three runs the Mets scored in the seventh in one-third of an inning. He gave up seven runs in his final two outings of the series. Awards & Statistical summary The World Series MVP was awarded to Ray Knight, who led the Mets' regulars with nine hits and a .393 average in the series. He also recorded five runs batted in, second to Gary Carter's nine. The naming of Knight as MVP instead of Hurst assured that Bobby Richardson of the 1960 New York Yankees would be the only World Series MVP from a losing team, as he remains as of 2020. Marty Barrett, in a losing effort, recorded 13 hits ‚Äî tying the single World Series recordBarrett tied the mark set by Bobby Richardson (Yankees) in 1964 and Lou Brock (Cardinals) in 1968. https://www.infoplease.com/people/baseball- players/world-series-single-game-and-single-series-records ‚Äî and a .433 average. Dave Henderson recorded ten hits and a .400 average, while Jim Rice and Wade Boggs each had nine hits. Despite the struggles both pitchers faced in Game 7, both Bruce Hurst and Ron Darling were the best starting pitchers on their respective staffs during the World Series. Both finished with 2-0 records and sub-2.00 ERAs, with Darling's 1.35 ERA topping Hurst's 1.96 although Hurst issued fewer walks and struck out more batters. The only other starter to win a decision was Bob Ojeda. Steve Crawford won Game 2 for the Red Sox while Rick Aguilera and Roger McDowell won Games 6 and 7 for the Mets. In fact, the record for the starting pitchers for both teams outside of Darling and Hurst was 1-4, with two of those losses recorded by Mets ace Dwight Gooden. His counterpart on the Red Sox, eventual Cy Young Award winner Roger Clemens, did not record a decision in either of his starts. Postscript Both the Mets and Red Sox would go without reaching the World Series for some time. The Red Sox would not return until 2004, where they would finally break through and win their first title since 1918. They have gone on to win three additional world championships, most recently in 2018. The Mets have returned to the World Series twice since 1986. In 2000, the first time since 1956 that two teams from the same city faced each other in the World Series, the Mets lost to the New York Yankees. The Mets returned in 2015, only to lose again to the Kansas City Royals. Neither Davey Johnson nor John McNamara would manage in another World Series. Johnson stayed on with the Mets until 1990, leading them to another postseason berth in 1988 that ended with a loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League Championship Series. He was fired early in the 1990 season. Johnson would later lead the Cincinnati Reds to the playoffs in 1995, then followed that with two more playoff runs with the Baltimore Orioles in 1996 and 1997. He finished his managerial career in 2013 with the Washington Nationals, where he led the team to its second ever playoff berth. McNamara returned for 1987 with the Red Sox but the team regressed significantly, finishing with only 78 wins. He would be fired the next year with the Red Sox barely above .500 at the All-Star break, and his successor Joe Morgan led the team to a comeback and division title. He would take over the Cleveland Indians in 1990, but was fired midway through 1991 with the team at 25-52. He would only manage once more after that, an interim position with the California Angels in 1996, before retiring. He died in July 2020 at the age of 88. Bill Buckner never did win that elusive World Series ring. He would be released by the Red Sox during the 1987 season, then spend the rest of the year with the California Angels. In 1988, he signed with the Kansas City Royals and played more of a reserve role for the last three years of his career, which ended in 1990 after a second stint with the Red Sox. Buckner's error made him a scapegoat in Red Sox fans' eyes for some time afterward, but following their world championship victory in 2004 the fanbase began to embrace him again. In his later years Buckner developed Lewy body dementia and he died from complications at the age of 69 in May 2019. Composite line score 1986 World Series (4‚Äì3): New York Mets (N.L.) beat Boston Red Sox (A.L.) Broadcast Game 6 did not end until 12:32 a.m. Eastern, causing the first and only cancellation of an episode of NBC's Saturday Night Live in the show's history. The episode, featuring Rosanna Arquette and scheduled to air live at 11:30 p.m. Eastern, was instead recorded for the studio audience beginning at 1:30 a.m., and aired November 8 with a comedic apology from Ron Darling. (NBC generally no longer schedules first-run SNL episodes on the same night as sports coverage.) NBC's broadcast of Game 7 (which went up against a Monday Night Football game between the Washington Redskins and New York Giants on ABC) garnered a Nielsen rating of 38.9 and a 55 share, making it the highest-rated single World Series game to date.

The collapse of the Boston Red Sox in Game 6 and Game 7 prompted a series of articles by George Vecsey of The New York Times, in which he mentions a \\"Babe Ruth Curse.\\" Although it had long been noted that the selling of Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees had marked the beginning of a down period in the Red Sox's fortunes, this was one of the first instances, if not the first, in which mention of a \\"curse\\" was made. The term \\"Curse of the Bambino\\" was not in common use by the press during the 1920s, nor can it be found through the 1970s, as a search of historical newspapers will illustrate. In fact, even though Vecsey's articles mention a \\"Babe Ruth Curse\\", the New York Times did not use the phrase \\"Curse of the Bambino\\" until 1990, the year that Dan Shaughnessy's book of the same name and a Boston Globe article about it were published. Shaughnessy's book The Curse of the Bambino helped that phrase become a key part of the Red Sox lore in the media thereafter. The dramatic sixth game was the subject of Game 6, a 2005 independent film starring Michael Keaton, based on a 1991 screenplay by novelist Don DeLillo. Village Voice film critic J. Hoberman included Game 6 in his list of the top ten films of 1986. In his song \\"Faith and Fear in Flushing Meadows\\", twee/folk artist Harry Breitner makes mention of Ray Knight and Mookie Wilson. The game, or more specifically an infamous jeer that was issued in the game against Darryl Strawberry, was referenced in The Simpsons episode Homer at the Bat where Bart and Lisa jeer Strawberry the exact same way due to being sore over his forcing Homer to remain on the bench. NBC's telecast of the Series ended with the song \\"Limelight\\" from Stereotomy, a penultimate album of The Alan Parsons Project. The Series, and especially Game 6, were referenced in the Seinfeld episode \\"The Boyfriend\\", which also guest starred former Mets player Keith Hernandez. Hernandez being referred to Game 6 in the episode suggested that he was part of the winning rally, even though he was the 2nd (and final) out of the inning. In a 1999 episode of The King of Queens, Doug Heffernan promises Richie Ianucci that they will watch the Series that is being rerun on TV, only to abandon him for Ray Barone, who invites him to play golf (with Arthur Spooner tagging along) until a rainstorm ends their plans. In another episode from the same year, Doug and his cousin Danny bring up the Series while revisiting their high school years. In the Curb Your Enthusiasm episode \\"Mister Softee\\", Bill Buckner appears as a guest star and mocks his famous 1986 mishap by missing a crucial catch of a Mookie Wilson-signed baseball. As the episode concludes, he redeems himself by catching a baby thrown from a burning building. In 2001, playwright David Kruh had his play Curse of the Bambino premiere at the Boston Lyric Stage.http://www.bambinomusical.com/DavidKruh.htm After the 2004 World Series it was rewritten with a happier ending. In Ron Darling's book, 108 Stitches, he claims that during Game 3. Lenny Dykstra used racial epithets toward Oil Can Boyd. Dykstra sued Darling over this.https://www.northjersey.com/story/sports/mlb/mets/2019/04/09/mets-lenny- dykstra-sues-ron-darling-over-book-claiming-racist-tirade/3417619002/ The case was later dismissed. In the 2005 film Bewitched starring Will Ferrell and Nicole Kidman, there's scene in which Jack (Ferrell) asks Isabel (Kidman) if her parents were in the witch business, Isabel answered that both her parents are and that her mother fixed the 1986 World Series.

The states of Germany are not allowed to maintain armed forces of their own, since the German Constitution states that matters of defense fall into the sole responsibility of the federal government. The Bundeswehr is divided into a military part (armed forces or Streitkr√§fte) and a civil part with the armed forces administration (Wehrverwaltung). The military part of the federal defense force consists of the German Army, the German Navy, the German Air Force, the Joint Support Service, the Joint Medical Service, and the Cyber and Information Domain Service. , the Bundeswehr has a strength of 184,258 active- duty military personnel and 79,973 civilians, placing it among the 30 largest military forces in the world and making it the second largest in the European Union behind France in terms of personnel. In addition the Bundeswehr has approximately 29,200 reserve personnel (2019). With German military expenditures at $49.3 billion, the Bundeswehr is the seventh or ninth best- funded military in the world, even if in terms of share of German GDP, military expenditures remain average at 1.3% well below the (non-binding) NATO target of 2%. Germany aims to expand the Bundeswehr to around 203,000 soldiers by 2025 to better cope with increasing responsibilities.  History  = Founding principles = The name Bundeswehr was first proposed by former Wehrmacht general and Liberal politician Hasso von Manteuffel. The Iron Cross (Eisernes Kreuz) is its official emblem. It is a symbol that has a long association with the military of Germany. The Schwarzes Kreuz is derived from the black cross insignia of the medieval Teutonic knights; since 1813 the symbol has been used to denote a military decoration for all ranks. When the Bundeswehr was established in 1955, its founding principles were based on developing a completely new military force for the defence of West Germany. In this respect the Bundeswehr did not consider itself to be a successor to either the Reichswehr (1921‚Äì1935) of the Weimar Republic or Hitler's Wehrmacht (1935‚Äì1946). Neither does it adhere to the traditions of any former German military organization. Its official ethos is based on three major themes: *the aims of the military reformers at the beginning of the 19th century such as Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, and Clausewitz *the conduct displayed by members of the military resistance against Adolf Hitler, especially the attempt of Claus von Stauffenberg and Henning von Tresckow to assassinate him. *its own tradition since 1955. A Gro√üer Zapfenstreich at the Federal Ministry of Defense in Bonn in 2002 Generals Adolf Heusinger and Hans Speidel being sworn into the newly founded Bundeswehr by Theodor Blank on 12 November 1955 One of the most visible traditions of the modern Bundeswehr is the Gro√üer Zapfenstreich; this is a form of military tattoo that has its origins in the landsknecht era. The FRG reinstated this formal military ceremony in 1952, three years before the foundation of the Bundeswehr. Today it is performed by a military band with 4 fanfare trumpeters and timpani, a corps of drums, up to two escort companies of the Bundeswehr's Wachbataillon (or another deputized unit) and Torchbearers. The Zapfenstreich is only performed during national celebrations or solemn public commemorations. It can honour distinguished persons present such as the German federal president or provide the conclusion to large military exercises. Another important tradition in the modern German armed forces is the Gel√∂bnis; the solemn oath made by conscripts (until 2011) now recruits during basic training and serving professional soldiers. There are two kinds of oath: for conscripts/recruits it is a pledge but it's a solemn vow for full-time personnel. The pledge is made annually on 20 July, the date on which a group of Wehrmacht officers attempted to assassinate Adolf Hitler in 1944. Recruits from the Bundeswehr's Wachbataillon make their vow (Gel√∂bnis) at the Bendlerblock in Berlin. This was the headquarters of the resistance but also where the officers were summarily executed following its failure. National commemorations are held nearby within the grounds of the Reichstag. Similar events also take place across the German Republic. Since 2011 (when conscription was suspended), the wording of the ceremonial vow for full-time recruits and volunteer personnel is: ::\\"Ich gelobe, der Bundesrepublik Deutschland treu zu dienen und das Recht und die Freiheit des deutschen Volkes tapfer zu verteidigen.\\" ::: Serving Bundeswehr personnel replace \\"Ich gelobe, ...\\" with \\"Ich schw√∂re, ...\\" (\\"I vow to...\\"). = Cold War 1955‚Äì1990 = The Federal Republic of Germany joined NATO in 1955. After World War II the responsibility for the security of Germany as a whole rested with the four Allied Powers: the United States, the United Kingdom, France and the Soviet Union. Germany had been without armed forces since the Wehrmacht was dissolved following World War II. When the Federal Republic of Germany was founded in 1949, it was without a military. Germany remained completely demilitarized and any plans for a German military were forbidden by Allied regulations. Some naval mine-sweeping units continued to exist, but they remained unarmed and under Allied control and did not serve as a national defence force. The Federal Border Protection Force, a mobile, lightly armed police force of 10,000 men, was formed on 14 March 1951 and expanded to 20,000 men on 19 June 1953. A proposal to integrate West German troops with soldiers of France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy in a European Defence Community was proposed but never implemented. There was a discussion among the United States, the United Kingdom and France over the issue of a revived (West) German military. In particular, France was reluctant to allow Germany to rearm in light of recent history (Germany had invaded France twice in living memory, in World War I and World War II, and also defeated France in the Franco-German War of 1870/71; (see also French‚ÄìGerman enmity). However, after the project for a European Defence Community failed in the French National Assembly in 1954, France agreed to West German accession to NATO and rearmament. Leopard 2 tanks With growing tensions between the Soviet Union and the West, especially after the Korean War, this policy was to be revised. While the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) was already secretly rearming, the seeds of a new West German force started in 1950 when former high-ranking German officers were tasked by Chancellor Konrad Adenauer to discuss the options for West German rearmament. The results of a meeting in the monastery of Himmerod formed the conceptual base to build the new armed forces in West Germany. The Amt Blank (Blank Agency, named after its director Theodor Blank), the predecessor of the later Federal Ministry of Defence, was formed the same year to prepare the establishment of the future forces. Hasso von Manteuffel, a former general of the Wehrmacht and liberal politician, submitted the name Bundeswehr for the new forces. This name was later confirmed by the West German Bundestag. The Bundeswehr was officially established on the 200th birthday of Scharnhorst on 12 November 1955. In personnel and education terms, the most important initial feature of the new German armed forces was to be their orientation as citizen defenders of a democratic state, fully subordinate to the political leadership of the country.Fritz Erler, 'Politik und nicht Prestige,' in Erler and Jaeger, Sicherheit und Rustung, 1962, p.82-3, cited in Julian Lider, Origins and Development of West German Military Thought, Vol. I, 1949‚Äì1966, Gower Publishing Company Ltd, Aldershot/Brookfield VT, 1986, p.125 A personnel screening committee was created to make sure that the future colonels and generals of the armed forces were those whose political attitude and experience would be acceptable to the new democratic state.Aberheim, 'The Citizen in Uniform: Reform and its Critics in the Bundeswehr,‚Äô in Szabo, (ed.), The Bundeswehr and Western Security, St. Martin‚Äôs Press, New York, 1990, p.39. There were a few key reformers, such as General Ulrich de Maiziere, General Graf von Kielmansegg, and Graf von Baudissin,Donald Aberheim, 1990, p.37; Donald Aberheim, ‚ÄòGerman Soldiers and German Unity: Political Foundations of the German Armed Forces,‚Äô California Naval Postgraduate School, 1991, p.14, cited in Artur A Bogowicz, ‚ÄòPolish Armed Forces of 2000: Demands and Changes ,' NPGS Thesis, March 2000, and Obituary for General Ulrich de Maizi√®re, The Times, 13 September 2006 who reemphasised some of the more democratic parts of Germany's armed forces history in order to establish a solid civil-military basis to build upon. The Bundeswehr was the first NATO member to use the Soviet-built MiG 29 jet, taken over from the former East German Air Force after reunification. After an amendment of the Basic Law in 1955, West Germany became a member of NATO. The first public military review took place at Andernach, in January 1956.Large, David Clay Germans to the Front West German rearmament in the Adenauer era University of North Carolina Press 1996 pp244-5 A US Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) helped with the introduction of the Bundeswehr's initial equipment and war material, predominantly of American origin. In 1956, conscription for all men between the ages of 18 and 45 was reintroduced, later augmented by a civil alternative with longer duration (see Conscription in Germany). In response, East Germany formed its own military force, the Nationale Volksarmee (NVA), in 1956, with conscription being established only in 1962. The Nationale Volksarmee was eventually dissolved with the reunification of Germany in 1990. Compulsory conscription was suspended ‚Äì but not completely abolished as an alternative ‚Äì in January 2011. During the Cold War the Bundeswehr was the backbone of NATO's conventional defence in Central Europe. It had a strength of 495,000 military and 170,000 civilian personnel. Although Germany had smaller armed forces than France and the United States, Cold War Historian John Lewis Gaddis assesses the Bundeswehr as \\"perhaps world's best army\\".John Lewis Gaddis, 'The Cold War ‚Äì a New History', Penguin Books, London, 2005, p.220 The Army consisted of three corps with 12 divisions, most of them heavily armed with tanks and APCs. The Luftwaffe owned significant numbers of tactical combat aircraft and took part in NATO's integrated air defence (NATINAD). The Navy was tasked and equipped to defend the Baltic Approaches, to provide escort reinforcement and resupply shipping in the North Sea and to contain the Soviet Baltic Fleet. During this time the Bundeswehr did not take part in combat operations. However, there were a number of large-scale training and operational casualties. The first such incident was in June 1957, when 15 paratroop recruits were drowned in the Iller river, Bavaria.Large op.cit. pp263-4 = German Reunification 1990 = At the time of reunification, the German military boasted a manpower of some 585,000 soldiers. As part of the German reunification process, under the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany (Two-Plus Four Treaty), which paved the way for reunification, the Bundeswehr was to be reduced to 370,000 personnel, of whom no more than 345,000 were to be in the Army and Air Force. This would be Germany's contribution to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe, and the restrictions would enter into force at the time the CFE treaty would. As a result, the Bundeswehr was significantly reduced, and the former East German Nationale Volksarmee (NVA) was disbanded, with a portion of its personnel and material being absorbed into the Bundeswehr. A Eurofighter Typhoon of the Luftwaffe About 50,000 Volksarmee personnel were integrated into the Bundeswehr on 2 October 1990. This figure was rapidly reduced as conscripts and short-term volunteers completed their service. A number of senior officers (but no generals or admirals) received limited contracts for up to two years to continue daily operations. Personnel remaining in the Bundeswehr were awarded new contracts and new ranks, dependent on their individual qualification and experience. Many were granted and accepted a lower rank than previously held in the Volksarmee. In general, the unification process of the two militaries ‚Äì under the slogan \\"Armee der Einheit\\" (or \\"Army of Unity\\") ‚Äì has been seen publicly as a major success and an example for other parts of the society. With the reduction, a large amount of the military hardware of the Bundeswehr, as well as of the Volksarmee, had to be disposed of. Most of the armoured vehicles and fighter jet aircraft (the Bundesluftwaffe ‚Äì due to reunification ‚Äì was the only air force in the world that flew both Phantoms and MIGs) were dismantled under international disarmament procedures. Many ships were scrapped or sold, often to the Baltic states or Indonesia (the latter received 39 former Volksmarine vessels of various types). With reunification, all restrictions on the manufacture and possession of conventional arms that had been imposed on the Bundeswehr as a condition for West German rearmament were lifted.Duffield, John: World Power Forsaken: Political Culture, International Institutions, and German Security Policy After Unification, p. 32 Since 1996, Germany also has its own special forces, the Kommando Spezialkr√§fte (Special Forces Command). It was formed after German citizens had to be rescued in Rwanda by Belgian Para-Commandos as the Special Commands of the Federal Police were not capable of operating in a war zone. = Reorientation = A major event for the German military was the suspension of the compulsory conscription for men in 2011. In 2011/12, a major reform of the Bundeswehr was announced, further limiting the number of military bases and soldiers. The last reform set a required strength of 185,000 soldiers.Madeline Chambers (3 December 2015), More assertive Germany considers bigger army as Syria vote looms Reuters. , the number of active military personnel in the Bundeswehr was down to 184,258, corresponding to a ratio of 2.2 active soldiers per 1,000 inhabitants. Military expenditure in Germany was at $49.3 billion in 2019. German military expenditures are lower than comparable countries of the European Union such as France and the United Kingdom, especially when taking into account Germany's larger population and economy. This discrepancy is often criticized by Germany's military allies, especially the United States. In September 2014, the Bundeswehr acknowledged chronic equipment problems that rendered its armed forces \\"unable to deliver its defensive NATO promises\\". Among the problems cited were dysfunctional weapons systems, armored vehicles, aircraft, and naval vessels unfit for immediate service due to a neglect of maintenance, and serious equipment and spare parts shortages. The situation was so dire that it was acknowledged that most of Germany's fighter aircraft and combat helicopters were not in deployable condition. In 2015, as a result of serious NATO-Russian tensions in Europe, Germany announced a major increase in defense spending. In May 2015, the German government approved an increase in defense spending, at the time 1.3% of GDP, by 6.2% over the following five years, allowing the Ministry of Defense to fully modernize the army. Plans were also announced to significantly expand the tank fleet to a potential number of 328, order 131 more Boxer armored personnel carriers, increase the submarine fleet, and to develop a new fighter jet to replace the Tornado. Germany considered increasing the size of the army, and in May 2016 it announced it would spend ‚Ç¨130 billion on new equipment by 2030 and add nearly 7,000 soldiers by 2023 in the first German military expansion since the end of the Cold War. In February 2017, the German government announced another expansion, which would increase the number of its professional soldiers by 20,000 by 2024. = Coordination with European Partners = The Bundeswehr is to play a greater role as \\"anchor army\\" for smaller NATO states, by improving coordination between its divisions and smaller members' Brigades. A further proposal, by Minister of Defence von der Leyen, to allow non-German EU nationals to join the Bundeswehr, has been met by strong opposition, even from her own party. As a consequence of improved Dutch-German cooperation, 2 of 3 Royal Netherlands Army Brigades are now under German Command. In 2014, the 11th Airmobile Brigade was integrated into the German Division of fast forces (DSK). The Dutch 43rd Mechanized Brigade will be assigned to the 1st Panzer Division of the German army, with the integration starting at the beginning of 2016, and the unit becoming operational at the end of 2019. Also, the Seebatallion of the German Navy will start operating under Royal Dutch Navy command until 2018. The Dutch-German military cooperation is seen as an example for setting up a European defense union. Also the Czech Republic's 4th Rapid Deployment Brigade, and Romania's 81st Mechanized Brigade, will be integrated into Germany's 10 Armoured Division and Rapid Response Forces Division.  Command organisation  Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Minister of Defence With the growing number of missions abroad it was recognized that the Bundeswehr required a new command structure. A reform commission under the chairmanship of the former President Richard von Weizs√§cker presented its recommendations in spring 2000. In October 2000 the Joint Support Service, the Streitkr√§ftebasis, was established to concentrate logistics and other supporting functions such as military police, supply and communications under one command. Medical support was reorganised with the establishment of the Joint Medical Service. In 2016, the Bundeswehr created its youngest branch the Cyber and Information Space Command. The combat forces of the Army are organised into three combat divisions and participate in multi-national command structures at the corps level. The Air Force maintains three divisions and the Navy is structured into two flotillas. The Joint Support Service and the Joint Medical Service are both organized in four regional commands of identical structure. All of these services also have general commands for training, procurement, and other general issues. A German Navy Sachsen-class frigate The minister of defence or the chancellor is supported by the Chief of Defense (CHOD, Generalinspekteur) and the service chiefs (Inspekteure: Inspector of the Army, Inspector of the Air Force, Inspector of the Navy) and their respective staffs in his or her function as commander-in-chief. The CHOD and the service chiefs form the Military Command Council (Milit√§rischer F√ºhrungsrat) with functions similar to those of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the United States. Subordinate to the CHOD is the Armed Forces Operational Command (Einsatzf√ºhrungskommando). For smaller missions one of the service HQs (e.g. the Fleet Command) may exercise command and control of forces in missions abroad. The Bundestag must approve any foreign deployment by a simple majority. This has led to some discontent with Germany's allies about troop deployments e.g. in Afghanistan since parliamentary consent over such issues is relatively hard to achieve in Germany. = Mission = German Army soldiers in Afghanistan in front of Dingo infantry mobility vehicles, 2009 The role of the Bundeswehr is described in the Constitution of Germany (Art. 87a) as absolutely defensive only. Its only active role before 1990 was the Katastropheneinsatz (disaster control). Within the Bundeswehr, it helped after natural disasters both in Germany and abroad. After 1990, the international situation changed from East-West confrontation to one of general uncertainty and instability. Today, after a ruling of the Federal Constitutional Court in 1994 the term \\"defence\\" has been defined to not only include protection of the borders of Germany, but also crisis reaction and conflict prevention, or more broadly as guarding the security of Germany anywhere in the world. According to the definition given by former Defence Minister Struck, it may be necessary to defend Germany even at the Hindu Kush. This requires the Bundeswehr to take part in operations outside of the borders of Germany, as part of NATO or the European Union and mandated by the UN.  Operations  Since the early 1990s the Bundeswehr has become more and more engaged in international operations in and around the former Yugoslavia, and also in other parts of the world like Cambodia or Somalia. After the 11 September 2001 attacks, German forces were employed in most related theaters except Iraq. Current international operations of the Bundeswehr (7 August 2017) Frigate Karlsruhe of the German Navy rescuing shipwrecked people off the coast of Somalia where it is patrolling Currently (12 October 2020) there are 3,303 Bundeswehr soldiers deployed in: * **Resolute Support Mission *** 1,135 personnel * **KFOR *** 71 personnel * **UNMISS *** 7 personnel * ** UNAMID *** 1 personnel * **UNIFIL *** 116 personnel * **EUTM Mali *** 79 personnel ** MINUSMA *** 994 personnel * Horn of Africa / Indian Ocean **Operation Atalanta *** 74 personnel * Mediterranean Sea ** Operation Sea Guardian *** 270 personnel * Mediterranean Sea ** Operation Irini *** 232 personnel * / ** Operation Counter Daesh *** 269 personnel * Western Sahara ** Minurso *** 1 personnel * ** UNMHA *** 3 personnel In addition to the numbers above, 51 soldiers are on permanent stand-by for medical evacuation operations around the world in assistance of ongoing German or coalition operations (STRATAIRMEDEVAC). In support of Allied stabilization efforts in Iraq, the Bundeswehr is also training the new Iraqi forces in locations outside Iraq, such as the United Arab Emirates and Germany. Since 1994, the Bundeswehr has lost about 100 troops in foreign deployments. See also: German Armed Forces casualties in Afghanistan. = Equipment = According to the new threat scenario facing Germany and its NATO allies, the Bundeswehr is currently reorganising itself. To realise growth in mobility and the enlargement of the air force's capabilities, the Bundeswehr is going to buy 53 Airbus A400M transports as well as 136 Eurofighter Typhoon:de:Liste von Luftfahrzeugen der Bundeswehr fighters and also several unmanned aerial vehicle models. 57 Eurocopter Tiger, 100 NH90 (18 of them in the naval version) and 15 special forces helicopters are being delivered. For the ground forces it plans to produce 560 Puma infantry fighting vehicles, at least 403 Boxer MRAV, started to introduce a novel land soldier system and a new generation of transportation vehicles and light vehicles, such as the Fennek, and KMW Grizzly. Further, the German Navy is going to build 4 new F125 class frigates, 6 new multi-role combat ships (dubbed ) and 6 Type 212 submarines.

The army's service uniform consists of a light gray, single-breasted coat and darker grey trousers, worn with a light blue shirt, black tie, and black shoes. The peaked, visored cap has been replaced by the beret as the most common form of headgear. Dress uniforms featuring dinner jackets or double- breasted coats are worn by officers for various social occasions. The battle and work uniform consists of Flecktarn camouflage fatigues, which are also worn on field duty. In practice, they are also used for general duty and off- post at least at barracks where there is also field duty even by others, and for the way home or to the post, and generally regarded as the Heer uniform.A soldier's joke about this situation runs thus: ‚ÄúThe service uniform is called service uniform because it's not worn on service, while the field uniform is called field uniform because it's not worn in the field.‚Äù (In the field they wear the battle uniform (‚ÄúGefechtsanzug‚Äù), an extended version of the field uniform.) In all three services, light sand-coloured uniforms are available for duty in warmer climates. In 2016 a new Multitarn pattern was launched, similar to the MultiCam uniforms of the British Army or US Army.Bei jedem Wetter, zu jeder Zeit: Neue Tarnung f√ºr die Truppe bundeswehr.de. Erding, Bayern, 9 February 2016. A different, traditional variety of the service uniform is worn by the Gebirgsj√§ger (mountain infantry), consisting of ski jacket, stretch trousers, and ski boots. Instead of the beret, they wear the grey \\"mountain cap\\". (see here for details.) The field uniform is the same, except for the (optional) metal Edelweiss worn on the forage cap. A German infantryman stands at the ready with his Heckler & Koch G36 during a practice exercise in 2004 as U.S. troops watch in the background. All rifles in the photo are equipped with blank firing adapters. The traditional arm-of-service colours appear as lapel facings and as piping on shoulder straps. Generals wear an inner piping of gold braid; other officers wear silver piping. Lapel facings and piping are maroon for general staff, green for infantry, red for artillery, pink for armour, black for engineers, yellow for communications, dark yellow for reconnaissance and various other colors for the remaining branches. Combat troops wear green (infantry), black (armour), or maroon (airborne) berets. Logistics troops and combat support troops, such as artillery or engineers, wear red berets. A gold or silver badge on the beret denotes the individual branch of service. The naval forces wear the traditional navy blue, double-breasted coat and trousers; enlisted personnel wear either a white shirt or a navy blue shirt with the traditional navy collar. White uniforms provide an alternative for summer. The officer's dress cap is mounted with a gold anchor surrounded by a wreath. The visor of the admiral's cap bears a double row of oak leaves. The air force service uniform consists of a blue jacket and trousers with a light blue shirt, dark blue tie, and black shoes. Olive battle dress similar to the army fatigue uniform is worn in basic training and during other field duty. Flying personnel wear wings on their right breast. Other air force personnel wear a modified wing device with a symbol in its centre denoting service specialisation. These T√§tigkeitsabzeichen come in bronze, silver, or gold, depending on one's length of service in the specialty. Wings, superimposed over a wreath, in gold, silver, or bronze, depending on rank, are also worn on the service or field cap. = Ranks = Service uniform of the German Army (Heer)Service uniform of the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) In general, officer ranks are those used in the Prussian and pre-1945 German armies. Officer rank insignia are worn on shoulder straps or shoulder boards. Army (Heer) and air force (Luftwaffe) junior officers' insignia are four pointed silver stars while field grade officers wear silver (black or white on camouflage uniforms) stars and an oak wreath around the lowest star. The stars and wreath are gold for general officers. In the case of naval (Marine) officers, rank is indicated by gold stripes on the lower sleeve of the blue service jacket and on shoulder boards of the white uniform. Soldier and NCO ranks are similar to those of the Prussian and pre-1945 German armies. In the army and air force, a Gefreiter corresponds to the NATO rank OR-2 and Obergefreiter as well as Hauptgefreiter to OR-3, while OR-4 stands for Stabsgefreiter and Oberstabsgefreiter. An Unteroffizier is the lowest-ranking sergeant (OR-5), followed by Stabsunteroffizier (also OR-5), Feldwebel and Oberfeldwebel (OR-6), Hauptfeldwebel (OR-7/8), Stabsfeldwebel (OR-8) and Oberstabsfeldwebel (OR-9). Ranks of army and air force enlisted personnel are designated by stripes, chevrons, and \\"sword knots\\" worn on rank slides. Naval enlisted rank designations are worn on the upper (OR 1‚Äì5) or lower (OR-6 and above) sleeve along with a symbol based on an anchor for the service specialization (rating). Army and air force officer candidates hold the separate ranks of Fahnenjunker (OR-5), F√§hnrich (OR-6) and Oberf√§hnrich (OR-7/8), and wear the appropriate rank insignia plus a silver cord bound around it. Officers candidates in the navy Seekadett (sea cadet; equivalent to OR-5) and F√§hnrich zur See (midshipman second class; OR-6) wear the rank insignia of the respective enlisted ranks but with a gold star instead of the rating symbol, while an Oberf√§hnrich zur See (midshipman first class; OR-7/8) wears an officer type thin rank stripe. Medical personnel of all three services wear a version of the traditional caduceus (staff with entwined serpents) on their shoulder straps or sleeve. The officers' ranks have own designations differing from the line officers, the rank insignias however are basically the same. = Women = Ulrike Flender, the first female combat pilot in the unified German military Women have served in the medical service since 1975. From 1993 they were also allowed to serve as enlisted personnel and non-commissioned officers in the medical service and the army bands. In 2000, in a lawsuit brought up by Tanja Kreil, the European Court of Justice issued a ruling allowing women to serve in more roles than previously allowed. Since 2001 they can serve in all functions of service without restriction, but they are not subject to conscription. There are presently around 19,064 women on active duty and a number of female reservists who take part in all duties including peacekeeping missions and other operations. In 1994, Verena von Weymarn became Generalarzt der Luftwaffe (Surgeon General of the Air Force), the first woman ever to reach the rank of general in the armed forces of Germany. For women, lower physical performance requirements are required in the basic fitness test, which must be completed at the time of recruitment and later on annually. The sex surcharge for the sprint test and the 1,000m run is 15%, for chin-up 40%. = Rank structure = ;Officers { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background-color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\\" } ;NCOs and enlisted { style=\\"border:1px solid #8888aa; background- color:#f7f8ff; padding:5px; font-size:95%; margin: 0px 12px 12px 0px;\\" }  Awards  * Badge of Honour of the Bundeswehr * Combat Action Medal of the Bundeswehr * German Armed Forces Badge of Marksmanship * German Armed Forces Badge for Military Proficiency * German Armed Forces Service Medal * German Flood Service Medal (2002) * German Flood Service Medal (2013) * German Parachutist Badge  See also  * Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany * Defence Force * United Nations Training Center of the Bundeswehr * Day X plot, alleged conspiracy of Bundeswehr soldiers to murder left-leaning politicians * Controversy over Erwin Rommel as Bundeswehr's role model References * Further reading * External links * Bundeswehr official site (in German) * Federal Ministry of Defence official site (in German, English and French) * Bundesamt f√ºr Wehrtechnik und Beschaffung official site (in German) * Bundesamt f√ºr Informationsmanagement und Informationstechnik der Bundeswehr official site (in German) * Territoriale Wehrverwaltung official site (in German) * Y ‚Äì Magazine of the Federal Defence Forces (in German) * Zeitschrift f√ºr Innere F√ºhrung (in German) * Reader Sicherheitspolitik (in German) Category:Military history of Germany Category:Articles containing video clips Category:Permanent Structured Cooperation ","title":"Bundeswehr"},{"id":"288189","text":"Julie Taymor (born December 15, 1952) is an American director and writer of theater, opera and film. Since her stage adaptation of The Lion King debuted in 1997, 24 global productions have been seen by more than 90 million people in over 100 cities in 19 countries, earning it the highest worldwide gross of any entertainment title in box office history. Lion King also received 11 Tony Award nominations, earning Taymor Tony Awards for Best Director and Costume Designer, and was honored with more than 70 major arts awards worldwide. In 1998, she became the first woman to win the Tony Award for Direction of a Musical with her staging of the theatre adaptation of The Lion King . Her film Frida about revered Mexican artist Frida Kahlo was nominated for five Academy Awards (including a Best Original Song nod for her composition \\"Burn It Blue\\"), and her \\"1960s Beatles jukebox musical\\" Across the Universe won approval from both Yoko Ono and Paul McCartney. These films developed her reputation for respectful handling of the sensitive legacy of artists amongst their fans. Taymor created the Taymor World Theater Fellowship in 2016 to provide opportunities for enterprising young theater directors to push their boundaries through travel, exposure to new experiences and experimentation. Early life Photograph of Taymor's mother, Elizabeth Bernstein Taymor, circa 1965 Taymor was born in Newton, Massachusetts, the daughter of Elizabeth (n√©e Bernstein), a political science professor and Democratic activist, and Melvin Lester Taymor, a gynecologist.\\"Julie Taymor Biography\\" Film Reference.com, accessed August 28, 2011 Taymor's interest in theatre took root early in her life. By age ten, she had joined the Boston Children's Theatre and starred in a number of productions. Being the youngest member of theatre groups became common. By 13, she was taking trips to Boston by herself every weekend, where she discovered Julie Portman's Theatre Workshop. At the age of 15, her parents sent her to both Sri Lanka and India with the Experiment in International Living. After graduating High School at 16, Taymor went to Paris to study with L'√âcole Internationale de Th√©√¢tre Jacques Lecoq. Her studies there exposed her to mime, which helped develop her physical sensibilities. While in Paris, Taymor worked with masks for the first time and immersed herself in film, especially the work of Fellini and Kurosawa. In 1970 Taymor was enrolled in Oberlin College in Ohio. During her second year, she interned with Joseph Chaikin's Open Theatre and other companies in New York City. Hearing that director Herbert Blau was moving to Oberlin, she returned there and auditioned successfully, becoming, once again, the youngest member of a troupe. In 1973, Taymor attended a summer program of the American Society for Eastern Arts in Seattle. The instructors were masters of Indonesian topeng masked dance-drama and wayang kulit shadow puppetry. This would prove to have a great effect on Taymor in later years. Taymor graduated from Oberlin College with a major in mythology and folklore and with Phi Beta Kappa honors in 1974. As a college senior, Taymor won a year long Thomas J. Watson Fellowship that began after graduation. The Watson allowed her to travel to Japan and Indonesia which she continued independently from 1975 until 1979. In Indonesia, she developed a mask/dance company, Teatr Loh, consisting of Japanese, Balinese, Sundanese, French, German and American actors, musicians, dancers and puppeteers. The company toured throughout Indonesia with two original productions, Way of Snow and Tirai, which were subsequently performed in the United States. She met her long-time collaborator, Elliot Goldenthal, in 1980. Taymor was the 2010 commencement speaker for her alma mater, Oberlin College in Oberlin, Ohio. Career =Theatre= Back in New York from Indonesia, Taymor remounted Tirai at La MaMa in 1980. Her next project, The Haggadah, came from the desire of The Public Theater director Joseph Papp to create an annual Passover pageant that would be culturally inclusive. In 1984, Taymor worked in collaboration with Theatre for a New Audience on a 60-minute version of A Midsummer Night's Dream presented at The Public Theater. Two years later, she directed her first Shakespeare play, The Tempest, for Theatre for a New Audience. She went on to direct three other productions at that theatre, including The Taming of the Shrew, Titus Andronicus and The Green Bird by Gozzi. She later adapted Tempest and Titus into major motion pictures. Taymor is known for a distinct visual style, with extensive use of puppets and masks, developed largely from her time in Indonesia working with Teatr Loh. Taymor is most widely recognized for her production of The Lion King, which opened on Broadway in 1997. Taymor's production is the highest grossing Broadway production of all time and among the longest running, and continues to play nightly and has been presented in 63 cities in over a dozen countries, having been seen by more than 45 million people worldwide.> Taymor has the distinction of being the first woman to receive the Tony Award for Best Direction of a Musical, which she won for The Lion King. She also received a Tony Award for her original costume designs for the production. Taymor co- designed the masks and puppets, and wrote additional lyrics for the show. In 2007, The Lion King was performed in Johannesburg, and had its first French language production in Paris. In 2008, Le Roi Lion was awarded Best Costume Design, Best Lighting Design, and Best Musical at the Moli√®re Awards, the national theatre awards of France. In 2000, Taymor directed Carlo Gozzi's The Green Bird on Broadway. The work was first produced in 1996 by Theatre for a New Audience at the New Victory Theater and presented at the La Jolla Playhouse. Taymor's stage production of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus was produced off-Broadway by Theatre for a New Audience in 1994. Other directing credits include The Tempest, The Taming of the Shrew, The Transposed Heads, based on the novella by Thomas Mann, co-produced by the American Musical Theater Festival and The Lincoln Center; and Liberty's Taken, an original musical co-created with David Suehsdorf and Elliot Goldenthal. Her original music-theatre work, Juan Dari√©n: A Carnival Mass, presented at Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater in 1996, received five Tony Award nominations including Best Director. Originally produced by Music Theater Group in 1988, Juan Dari√©n: A Carnival Mass was directed by Taymor, and co-written with Elliot Goldenthal. The recipient of two Obies and numerous other awards, the piece was performed at The Edinburgh International Festival, as well as festivals in France, Jerusalem and Montreal, and had an extended run in San Francisco. In April 2007, it was announced that a musical adaptation of Spider-Man was being prepared for Broadway. Taymor was selected to direct the show and write the book with Glen Berger. The production features music and lyrics by Bono and The Edge. The musical, Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark, was scheduled to begin previews on November 28, 2010, at the Foxwoods Theatre. The play was delayed for several months due to numerous injuries, and Taymor was fired and replaced by Philip William McKinley. The play officially opened on June 14, 2011, having set the record for the longest preview period in the history of Broadway at 182 performances. The production also set the record for most expensive Broadway production at an estimated $75 million.Pennacchio, George. \\"Spider-Man musical opens: What critics said\\" . ABClocal-KABC, June 14, 2011 Taymor was a 2015 inductee into the Theater Hall of Fame for Lifetime Achievement in the American Theater. Taymor directed a Broadway revival of David Henry Hwang's M. Butterfly, starring Clive Owen, which opened on October 26, 2017, at the Cort Theatre, with previews beginning on October 7. David Henry Hwang made changes to the original text for the revival, mostly centering around the issue of intersectional identities. =Stage production history= *Way of Snow (1974‚Äì75, 1980) ‚Äì writer, director, and designer in Java and Bali and The Ark Theater, New York City *Tirai (1978‚Äì79, 1981) ‚Äì writer, director, and designer in Java and Bali and La MaMa, New York City *The Haggadah (1980) ‚Äì sets, costumes, masks, and puppetry produced for the NY Shakespeare Festival/Public Theater, New York City *Black Elk Lives (1981) ‚Äì sets, masks, and puppetry produced at Intermedia Theater, New York City *The King Stag (1984) ‚Äì costumes, masks, puppetry and choreography produced at ART, Cambridge, MA *Liberty's Taken (1985) ‚Äì director, masks, and puppetry produced at the Castle Hill Festival, MA *The Transposed Heads (1984, 1986) ‚Äì director, masks, and puppetry produced at The Ark Theater, NYC and Lincoln Center *The Tempest (1986, by Shakespeare, abridged) ‚Äì director, puppetry. produced for Theatre for a New Audience at Classic Stage Company (NYC) *The Taming of the Shrew (1988, by Shakespeare) ‚Äì director, produced by Theatre For a New Audience *Juan Dari√©n: A Carnival Mass (1988, 1990, 1996) ‚Äì director, co- bookwriter, co-scenic designer, co-costume designer, mask designer, puppet designer ‚Äì Tony Award co-nomination for Best Scenic Design, Tony Award nomination for Best Direction of a Musical *Oedipus Rex (1992, by Igor Stravinsky) ‚Äì director, puppetry. at Sito Kinen Festival in Matsumoto (taped for TV, released 1993 / released DVD) *The Magic Flute (1993, by Mozart ‚Äì director, costume designer, masks and puppetry designer by Taymor and Michael Curry *Titus Andronicus (1994, by Shakespeare) ‚Äì director, produced by Theatre For a New Audience *The Flying Dutchman (1996, by Richard Wagner) ‚Äì director *Salome (1995 premiere at Passionstheater, Oberammergau, Germany) directed and choreographed by Taymor and Andreas Liyepa *The Lion King (1997) ‚Äì director, lyricist for the song \\"Endless Night\\", costume designer, co-mask designer, co- puppet designer ‚Äì Tony Award winner for Best Direction of a Musical, Tony Award co-nomination for Best Original Score, Tony Award winner for Best Costume Design *The Green Bird (2000) ‚Äì director, mask designer, puppet designer produced by Theatre for a New Audience at the New Victory Theater, La Jolla, and on Broadway at the Cort Theatre *The Magic Flute (premiered 2005, opera by Mozart) ‚Äì director, Metropolitan Opera (NY), live broadcast *The Magic Flute (2006), newly translated and abridged version, Metropolitan Opera, Opera Australia (2012) *Grendel (2007, opera by Elliot Goldenthal) ‚Äì librettist, director, co- commissioned and performed at The LA Opera and The Lincoln Center Festival *Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark (2010, musical adaptation of Spider-Man) ‚Äì director, co-author, mask designer, Broadway at the Foxwoods Theatre *A Midsummer Night's Dream (2013) ‚Äì director, TFANA, Polonsky Shakespeare Center *Grounded (2015) ‚Äì director, The Public Theater *M.

The hour-long film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and aired on PBS in March 1992. In the film, all characters except the titular character Hop-Frog are either elaborate puppets or masks, not unlike Taymor‚Äôs stage work. The film won the Best Drama award at the Tokyo International Electronic Cinema Festival. Taymor also directed a film adaptation of opera Oedipus Rex after directing a stage production of the same opera. The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival and won the Jury Award at the Montreal Festival of Film on Art. Broadcast internationally in 1993, the film garnered an Emmy Award and the 1994 International Classical Music Award for Best Opera Production. Taymor's feature film debut, Titus (1999), starring Anthony Hopkins, Jessica Lange, Alan Cumming and Jonathan Rhys Meyers, was an adaptation of Shakespeare's play Titus Andronicus. Taymor adapted the screenplay and produced the film, which received an Academy Award nomination for costume design. Taymor received critical acclaim for her direction of Salma Hayek and Alfred Molina in Frida, the true story of the Mexican artist Frida Kahlo. Frida garnered six Academy Award nominations, including a Best Actress nomination for Hayek, and won two Academy Awards for make-up and original score. Frida was honored with four BAFTA nominations and one win, including nominations for Hayek and Molina, as well as two Golden Globe nominations, winning the Golden Globe for Best Original Score. In addition, the film received two Screen Actors Guild nominations. The film premiered at the Venice Film Festival where it won the festival's Mimmo Rotella Foundation Award. Her next film was jukebox musical Across the Universe (2008), which received a Golden Globe nomination for Best Musical/Comedy as well as an Academy Award for Costume Design. With a collection of 33 Beatles songs, the film stars Evan Rachel Wood and Jim Sturgess in a 1960s love story set to the music of The Beatles, and featured performances by Bono, Joe Cocker, Eddie Izzard and Salma Hayek. Taymor both directed and co-wrote the story for the film. In November 2008, Taymor directed a film version of Shakespeare's The Tempest, released in December 2010 starring Helen Mirren, Alfred Molina, Djimon Hounsou and Ben Whishaw. Working behind the camera with Taymor on The Tempest were the Academy Award winners Elliot Goldenthal for music, Sandy Powell for costumes, and Fran√ßoise Bonnot. Taymor produced the feature and adapted the screenplay based on Shakespeare's play. She also completed a cinematic version of William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, starring David Harewood, Max Casella and Kathryn Hunter, and filmed during her critically acclaimed, sold-out stage production that ran at Theatre for a New Audience's new home in downtown Brooklyn. The film was shown at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival as part of the Mavericks in Film Programme. Taymor is set to direct The Glorias, an upcoming biopic of feminist icon Gloria Steinem starring Julianne Moore and Alicia Vikander. =Filmography= *Fool's Fire (1992) (TV) *Oedipus rex (1993) (opera) *Titus (1999) *Frida (2002) *Across the Universe (2007) *The Tempest (2010) *A Midsummer Night's Dream (2014) *The Glorias (2020) =Opera= Taymor's first opera direction was of Stravinsky's Oedipus rex, for the Saito Kinen Orchestra in Japan, under the baton of Seiji Ozawa in 1992. The opera featured Philip Langridge as Oedipus and Jessye Norman as Jocasta. Taymor went on to direct the film adaptation of the opera Oedipus Rex. She went on to direct Wagner's The Flying Dutchman for the Los Angeles Opera in a co-production with the Houston Grand Opera. She directed Richard Strauss' Salome for the Kirov Opera in Russia, Germany, and Israel under the baton of Valery Gergiev. Taymor's first direction of The Magic Flute (), was for the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino in Florence, with Zubin Mehta conducting in 1993. Over a decade later, Taymor premiered The Magic Flute at the Metropolitan Opera in 2004. The show is now in repertoire there. A newly translated and abridged English version of the opera premiered at the Met in December 2006, and inaugurated a new series on PBS in 2010 entitled, Great Performances at the Met as well as launched the Metropolitan Opera Live in HD series of movie-theater transmissions. In June 2006, Taymor directed the premiere of Elliot Goldenthal's opera Grendel for the Los Angeles Opera, starring Eric Owens, which was also presented as part of the Summer 2006 Lincoln Center Festival in New York City. A darkly comic retelling of the Beowulf tale based on the novel by John Gardner, the opera was co-commissioned by the Los Angeles Opera and the Lincoln Center Festival. The opera was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2007. For the Metropolitan Opera 2005/06 season, Taymor directed a successful production of The Magic Flute. It was revised for the 2006/07 season and, in addition to full-length performances, was adapted for a 100-minute version over the holiday season to appeal to children. That version of the opera was the first of a series of NCM Fathom Live on the Big Screen presentations of MET operas downloaded via satellite to movie theaters across North America and parts of Europe for the 2006/07 season. In 2012, Opera Australia produced this version with locally built scenery and props at the Sydney Opera House, the Arts Centre Melbourne, and the Queensland Performing Arts Centre in Brisbane. =Books= *The Lion King: Pride Rock on Broadway (1998) ‚Äì author.

Winners epitomize great ability combined with diligence, perseverance, and hard work. It is presented by the Heisman Trophy Trust in early December before the postseason bowl games. The award was created by the Downtown Athletic Club in 1935 to recognize \\"the most valuable college football player east of the Mississippi,\\" and was first awarded to University of Chicago halfback Jay Berwanger. After the death in October 1936 of the Club's athletic director, John Heisman, the award was named in his honor and broadened to include players west of the Mississippi. Heisman had been active in college athletics as a football player; a head football, basketball, and baseball coach; and an athletic director. It is the oldest of several overall awards in college football, including the Maxwell Award, Walter Camp Award, and the AP Player of the Year. The Heisman and the AP Player of the Year honor the outstanding player, while the Maxwell and the Walter Camp award recognizes the best player, and the Archie Griffin Award recognizes the most valuable player. The most recent winner of the Heisman Trophy is Louisiana State University quarterback Joe Burrow. Trophy design The trophy itself, designed by sculptor Frank Eliscu, is modeled after Ed Smith, a leading player in 1934 for the now-defunct New York University football team. The trophy is made out of cast bronze, is 13.5 inches (34.3 cm) tall, 14 inches long, 16 inches in width and 45 pounds (20.4 kg).https://www.heisman.com/about-the- heisman/heisman-trophy-design/ Eliscu had asked Smith, his former George Washington High School classmate, to pose for a commissioned sculpture of a football player. Smith did not realize until 1982 that the sculpture had become the Heisman Trophy. The Downtown Athletic Club presented Smith with a Heisman Trophy of his own in 1985. From its inception in 1935, the statue was cast by Dieges & Clust in New York (and later Providence, Rhode Island) until 1980, when Dieges and Clust was sold to Herff Jones. For a time until at least 2008, the statues were cast by Roman Bronze Works in New York. Since 2005 the trophy has been made by MTM Recognition in Del City, Oklahoma. Selection Originally only players east of the Mississippi were eligible, but since 1936 all football players playing in all divisions of college football nationwide are eligible for the award, though winners usually represent Division I Football Bowl Subdivision schools. There are three categories of eligible voters for the award winner: * Sports journalists: Heisman.com states that sports journalists are to be the determinants of the award since they are \\"informed, competent, and impartial.\\" There are 870 media voters: 145 voters from each of six regions. * Previous Heisman winners (and in cases where an underclassman wins the award and remains in school to play, a prior winner may also be a current candidate). According to Heisman.com there are currently 57 prior winners eligible to vote and, thus, 57 potential votes (a prior winner is not required to vote and does not lose his voting privileges by not voting). * Fans: As the Premier Partner of the Heisman Trophy, Nissan has a vote and gives this to the fans. Fan voting done through a survey collected by ESPN on NissanHeismanHouse.com. This constitutes one Heisman vote. Except for the one vote based on the fan voting, the balloting is based on positional voting, whereby each voter identifies three selections, ranking them in order. Each first-place selection is awarded three points, each second-place selection is awarded two points, and each third-place selection is awarded one point. Voters must make three selections and cannot duplicate a selection, else the ballot is invalid and none of the selections count. The accounting firm Deloitte is responsible for the tabulation of votes, which has moved almost exclusively to online voting since 2007. Notable achievements *Larry Kelley and Clint Frank of Yale were the first teammates to win the Heisman Trophy, in 1936 and 1937. *Nile Kinnick of Iowa was the only Heisman Trophy winner (1939) to have a stadium named after him. In 1972, the University of Iowa renamed its football complex Kinnick Stadium. Kinnick is also the only winner to die in military service of the United States; he went down piloting an F4F Wildcat from the deck of USS Lexington (CV-16). His death in 1943 made him the first Heisman Trophy winner to die. *Doc Blanchard was the first junior to win the Heisman Trophy when he led Army to the national title in 1945. *In 1946, Army played Notre Dame in the Game of the Century. The game is notable in that it had four players who won or would go on to win the Heisman Trophy: Army‚Äôs Doc Blanchard (1945 winner), Glenn Davis (1946 winner), Notre Dame‚Äôs Johnny Lujack (1947 winner), and Leon Hart (1949 winner). *Paul Hornung was the only player to win the Heisman Trophy as a player for a losing team. He took the award at Notre Dame 1956, when the Irish finished 2‚Äì8 on the year. *Ernie Davis was the first African American player to win the Heisman Trophy. He attended Syracuse University was drafted first overall in 1962, yet never played a game in the NFL as he was diagnosed with leukemia and died in 1963. *Terry Baker was the only player to win the Heisman Trophy and play in the Final Four in the NCAA Basketball Tournament in the same school year (1962‚Äì63). *Archie Griffin of Ohio State is the only player to receive the award twice, winning it as a junior in 1974 and a senior in 1975. *Steve Spurrier, the 1966 recipient as a Florida Gator, became the first Heisman Trophy winner to coach a winner in 1996 (Danny Wuerffel, also of the University of Florida). *Charles Woodson of the University of Michigan is the only primarily defensive player to win the award, beating out favorite Peyton Manning, quarterback for the University of Tennessee, in 1997. He was a standout cornerback, but also occasionally played as a wide receiver and punt returner. *In 2007, Tim Tebow became the first sophomore to win the Heisman. He also became the first major college quarterback to rush for 20 touchdowns and pass for 20 touchdowns in a season. *In 2012, Johnny Manziel became the first redshirt freshman to win the award. *In 2016, Lamar Jackson became the youngest player to win the Heisman, at old. *In 2017, Baker Mayfield became the first former walk-on player to win the Heisman. *In 2018, Kyler Murray helped give the University of Oklahoma back-to-back Heisman winners, since Mayfield also played at Oklahoma. Murray and Mayfield are also the first quarterbacks from the same school to win the Heisman in back-to-back years in history. *2019 Heisman Trophy winner, senior quarterback Joe Burrow of LSU, broke numerous voting records. In the more than eight decades of the award‚Äôs history, Burrow received the highest percentage of first place votes ever with 90.7% of the ballots listing Burrow as the winner. In addition, Burrow‚Äôs win was the largest margin of victory ever, beating second place finalist Jalen Hurts from the University of Oklahoma by 1,846 points. Burrow finished with 841 first-place votes, while runner-up Hurts finished with 20 first-place votes. Burrow also received the highest percentage ever of possible points with 93.8% and the highest ever percentage of ballots with 95.5%. Ohio State, Oklahoma, and Notre Dame have the most number of Heisman trophies won, each with seven; Ohio State has had six different players win the award. The player who received the most votes (by percentage) was Joe Burrow of LSU in 2019, with 93.8% of possible points. Burrow also won by the largest margin of votes, with 1,846 votes over second place. USC running back O. J. Simpson received the most total first place votes, in 1968, with 855, at a time when there were more total voters. The closest margin of votes was in 2009 between winner Mark Ingram of Alabama and Toby Gerhart of Stanford. Eleven of the Heisman Trophy winners are in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and four winners have also been named Most Valuable Player in a Super Bowl. Some winners have gone on to play in other professional sports, including Bo Jackson in baseball and Charlie Ward in basketball. Pete Dawkins and Dick Kazmaier are the only winners not to pursue a professional sports career: Dawkins had a career with the United States Army where he achieved the rank of Brigadier General; Kazmaier attended Harvard Business School, founded a consulting company specializing in sports marketing, and chaired the President's Council on Fitness, Sports, and Nutrition during 1988‚Äì89. University success In addition to personal statistics, team achievements play a heavy role in the voting ‚Äì a typical Heisman winner represents a team that had an outstanding season and was most likely in contention for the national championship or a major conference championship at some point in that season. The closest that a player outside the modern Division I FBS came to winning the Heisman is third place; in both cases, the players involved played for schools in what was at the time Division I-AA, now Division I FCS. The first was Gordie Lockbaum from Holy Cross in 1987, followed by Steve McNair, from Alcorn State in 1993. Armanti Edwards, from Appalachian State University, was also briefly mentioned as a candidate for the award following Appalachian's upset of No. 5-ranked Michigan in 2007. Besides Griffin winning consecutive Heismans at Ohio State, four other programs had two different players win the Heisman Trophy in consecutive years: Yale (1936‚Äì37), Army (1945‚Äì46), Southern California (USC) (2004‚Äì05, though Reggie Bush voluntarily forfeited his 2005 award in September 2010 and sent the trophy back to the Heisman Trust), and Oklahoma (2017-2018). With an earlier win in 2002, the USC program actually had three different winners within four years. Only three high schools have produced multiple Heisman trophy winners. The first was Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas, Texas (Davey O'Brien in 1938 and Tim Brown in 1987) (Woodrow remains the only public high school to be so recognized). Thereafter, two private high schools also achieved this distinction: Fork Union Military Academy in Fork Union, Virginia (Vinny Testaverde as a Postgraduate in 1982, and Eddie George in 1996) and Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, California (John Huarte in 1964 and Matt Leinart in 2004). Of the colleges where trophy namesake John Heisman coached, only Auburn University has produced Heisman winners, with Pat Sullivan in 1971, Bo Jackson in 1985, and Cam Newton in 2010. Class and age For most of its history, most winners of the Heisman have been seniors. Texas A&M; quarterback Johnny Manziel became the first freshman to win the Heisman in 2012. The following year, at old, Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston became the youngest Heisman Trophy winner at that time as a freshman. Both, however, were in their second year of college, having been redshirted during their first year of attendance, meaning that no true freshman has yet won the award. No sophomore won the Heisman in its first 72 years, at which point there were three consecutive sophomore winners ‚Äî Tim Tebow in 2007, followed by Sam Bradford and Mark Ingram Jr. ‚Äî with Lamar Jackson, who also surpassed Winston's record as the youngest Heisman winner, becoming the fourth in 2016. Of the four sophomores to have won the award, only Bradford had been redshirted; the others all won during their second year of college attendance. Only a few juniors have won the award, starting with the eleventh winner in 1945, Doc Blanchard. Five players have finished in the top three of the Heisman voting as freshmen or sophomores before later winning the award: Angelo Bertelli, Glenn Davis, Doc Blanchard, Doak Walker, and Herschel Walker. Eight players have finished in the top three as freshmen or sophomores but never won a Heisman: Clint Castleberry, Marshall Faulk, Michael Vick, Rex Grossman, Larry Fitzgerald, Adrian Peterson, Deshaun Watson, and Christian McCaffrey. Four players have specifically finished second in consecutive years: Glenn Davis (second in 1944 and 1945, winner in 1946), Charlie Justice (second 1948 and 1949), Darren McFadden (second 2006 and 2007), and Andrew Luck (second 2010 and 2011). The oldest and youngest Heisman winners ever both played for Atlantic Coast Conference schools. The oldest, Chris Weinke, was 28 years old when he won in 2000; he spent six years in minor league baseball before enrolling at Florida State. The youngest winner is 2016 recipient Lamar Jackson of Louisville at the age of , four days younger than Jameis Winston was when he won in 2013. Position The Heisman is usually awarded either to a running back or a quarterback; very few players have won the trophy playing a position other than those two aforementioned. Two tight ends have won the trophy, Larry Kelley and Leon Hart. Also, Desmond Howard and Tim Brown won as wide receivers. Charles Woodson is the only primarily defensive player to win the award, doing so as a defensive back, kick returner, and occasional wide receiver for Michigan in 1997. Legendary linebacker Dick Butkus only placed sixth in 1963 and third in 1964 and could qualify as an interior lineman, as he played center on offense during his era when two-way players were still common. The highest finish ever for any individual who played exclusively on defense is second, by defensive end Hugh Green of Pittsburgh in 1980 and linebacker Manti Te'o of Notre Dame in 2012. Although the Heisman is named in honor of an interior lineman, no interior lineman on either side of the ball has ever won the award. Offensive guard Tom Brown of Minnesota and the offensive tackle John Hicks of Ohio State placed second in 1960 and 1973, respectively. Rich Glover, a defensive lineman from Nebraska, finished 3rd in the 1972 vote‚Äîwhich was won by his Cornhusker teammate Johnny Rodgers. Washington's DT Steve Emtman finished 4th in voting in 1991. Ndamukong Suh of Nebraska finished fourth in 2009 as a defensive tackle. Also, Kurt Burris, a center for the Oklahoma Sooners football team, was a runner-up for the award in 1954 and Orlando Pace finished fourth in 1996 as an offensive tackle for Ohio State. Venue Due to the neighborhood housing the Downtown Athletic Club's facilities becoming blockaded after the attacks on 9/11, the 2001 award ceremony was moved to the New York Marriott Marquis in Times Square. After the DAC declared bankruptcy in 2002, the Yale Club hosted the presentation at its facility in 2002 and 2003. The ceremony moved to the Hilton New York for 2004 and has been presented annually at the PlayStation Theater, formerly known as the Best Buy Theater and the Nokia Theatre Times Square, since 2005. In 2017, the 83rd edition of the Heisman Trophy presentation returned to the Marquis Theatre. The 2008 Heisman press conference was held at the Sports Museum of America at 26 Broadway near the old Downtown Club building. There was an entire gallery with the museum-attraction dedicated to the Trophy, including the making of the Trophy, the history of the DAC, and information on John Heisman and all the Trophy's winners. There was also a dedicated area celebrating the most recent winner, and the opportunity for visitors to cast their vote for next winner (with the top vote-winner receiving 1 official vote on their behalf). The Sports Museum of America closed permanently in February 2009. History The award was first presented in 1935 by the Downtown Athletic Club (DAC) in New York City, a privately owned recreation facility located on the lower west side near the later World Trade Center site. It was first known simply as the DAC Trophy. The first winner, Jay Berwanger, was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles but declined to sign for them. He never played professional football for any team. In 1936, John Heisman died and the trophy was renamed in his honor. Larry Kelley, the second winner of the award, was the first man to win it as the \\"Heisman Trophy\\". The first African American player to win the Heisman was Syracuse's Ernie Davis, who never played a snap in the NFL. He was diagnosed with leukemia shortly after winning the award and died in 1963. In 1966, former Florida Gators quarterback Steve Spurrier gave his Heisman trophy to the university president, Dr. J. Wayne Reitz, so that the award could be shared by Florida students and faculty. The gesture caused Florida's student government to raise funds to purchase a replacement trophy for Spurrier. Since then, the Downtown Athletic Club has issued two trophies to winners, one to the individual and a replica to his college. Several Heisman trophies have been sold over the years; although there is a ban on the sale of all trophies awarded since 1999, trophies awarded in previous years can be sold. O. J. Simpson's 1968 trophy was sold in February 1999 for $230,000 as part of the settlement of the civil trial in the O. J. Simpson murder case. Yale end Larry Kelley sold his 1936 Heisman in December 1999 for $328,110 to settle his estate and to provide a bequest for his family. Charles White's 1979 trophy first sold for $184,000 and then for nearly $300,000 in December 2006 to help pay back federal income taxes. The current record price for a Heisman belongs to the trophy won by Minnesota halfback Bruce Smith in 1941 at $395,240. Paul Hornung sold his Heisman for $250,000 to endow student scholarships for University of Notre Dame students from his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. Eliscu's original plaster cast sold at Sotheby's for $228,000 in December 2005. Television coverage The presentation of the Heisman trophy was not broadcast on television until 1977. Before 1977, the presentation of the award was not televised as a stand-alone special, but rather as a quick in-game feature. The ceremony usually aired on ABC as a feature at halftime of the last major national telecast (generally a rivalry game) of the college football season. ABC essentially showed highlights since the award was handed out as part of an annual weeknight dinner at the Heisman Club. At the time, the event had usually been scheduled for the week following the Army‚ÄìNavy Game. The most watched Heisman ceremony ever was in 2009 when Mark Ingram won over Toby Gerhart and Colt McCoy. On December 8, 1977, CBS (who paid $200,000 for the rights) aired a one-hour (at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time) special to celebrate the presentation of the Heisman trophy to Earl Campbell of the University of Texas. Elliott Gould and O. J. Simpson were the co-hosts, with Connie Stevens and Leslie Uggams providing musical entertainment and Robert Klein providing some comic relief. Since then, a number of companies have provided television coverage of the event: * CBS (1977‚Äì1980, 1986‚Äì1990) * ABC (1981‚Äì1984) ‚Äì owned-and-operated stations only * Syndication (1981‚Äì1985) * NBC (1985) ‚Äì owned-and-operated stations only * NBC (1991‚Äì1993) * ESPN (1994‚Äìpresent) Controversy and politics =Regional bias controversy= A number of critics have expressed concern about the unwritten rules regarding player position and age, as noted above. Over the years, there has been substantial criticism of a regional bias, suggesting that the Heisman balloting process has ignored West Coast players. At present, the Pac-12 Conference (formerly Pac-10 and Pac-8) represents 12 of the 65 teams (roughly 18.5%) in the Power Five conferences. The Heisman can be, and has been, presented to players from other conferences, but a random sample over a long period of time might suggest that Pac-10/12 players might win somewhere close to 18% of the Heisman awards. In the 20 seasons between 1981 (Marcus Allen) and 2002 (Carson Palmer), not a single Pacific-10 Conference or other West Coast player won the Heisman Trophy. Three Southern California (USC) players have won the trophy in the early years of the 21st century and two won it subsequent to Palmer. Although Terry Baker, quarterback from Oregon State, won the trophy in 1962, and Gary Beban from UCLA won in 1967, no non-USC player from the West Coast had won between Stanford's Jim Plunkett in 1970 and Oregon's Marcus Mariota in 2014. Other than Mariota's win, the closest since Plunkett's wins have been John Elway, Toby Gerhart, Andrew Luck, Christian McCaffrey, and Bryce Love. All five were Stanford players who finished second in the Heisman balloting 1982, each year from 2009 to 2011, 2015, and 2017. The West Coast bias discussion usually centers on the idea that East Coast voters see few West Coast games, because of television coverage contracts, time zone differences, or cultural interest. At Heisman- projection website StiffArmTrophy.com, commentator Kari Chisholm claims that the Heisman balloting process itself is inherently biased: > \\"For Heisman voting purposes, the nation is divided into six regions‚Äîeach of > which get 145 votes. Put another way, each region gets exactly 16.67 percent > of the votes. However, each region does not constitute an even one-sixth of > the population. Three regions (Far West, Midwest, and Mid-Atlantic) have > larger populations than 16.67% of the national population; and three have > less (Northeast, South, and Southwest). In fact, the Far West has the > greatest population at 21.2% of the country and the Northeast has the least > at 11.9%.\\" =Nullification of 2005 award= In 2010 University of Southern California athletic director Pat Haden announced the university would return its replica of the 2005 Heisman Trophy due to NCAA sanctions requiring the university to dissociate itself from Reggie Bush. The NCAA found that Bush had received gifts from an agent while at USC. On September 14, 2010, Bush voluntarily forfeited his title as a Heisman winner. The next day, the Heisman Trust announced the 2005 award would remain vacated and removed all mention of the 2005 award from its official website. Bush eventually returned the trophy itself to the Heisman Trust in 2012. Critical responses from the national media were strident and varied. CBSSports.com producer J. Darin Darst opined that Bush \\"should never have been pressured to return the award.\\" Kalani Simpson of Fox Sports wrote, \\"Nice try Heisman Trust...It's a slick move to try to wipe the slate clean.\\" Former Football Writers Association of America president Dennis Dodd, on the other hand, decided to fictitiously award Bush's vacated 2005 award to Vince Young, the original runner-up that year. He wrote, \\"Since the Heisman folks won't re-vote, we did. Vince Young is the new winner of the 2005 Heisman.\\" A Los Angeles Times piece argued that Bush's Heisman was \\"tainted\\" but lamented that the decision came five years after Bush was awarded the trophy and, therefore, four years after the expiration of Bush's term as current holder of the Heisman title. = Elections involving notable controversy= * 2013 ** Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston won the 2013 Heisman Trophy amidst a sexual assault investigation. * 2010 ** Auburn quarterback Cam Newton won the 2010 Heisman Trophy amidst an NCAA eligibility inquiry. *1967 **Despite his team's beating the Bruins during the hours before the ceremony, USC's O.J.

In the Instructions of Amenemhat the king describes, from beyond the grave, how he was the victim of an assassination.(\\"Religion in ancient Egypt\\" Byron Esely Shafer, John b., Leonard H. Lesko, David P. Silverman, p160, Taylor & Francis, 1991 ) Due to the universal nature of the themes explored in Sinuhe, including divine providence and mercy, its anonymous author has been described as the \\"Egyptian Shakespeare\\" whose ideas have parallels in biblical texts. Sinuhe is considered to be a work written in verse and it may also have been performed.Edmund S. Meltzer, In search of Sinuhe: \\"What's in a Name?\\" Paper presented at The 58th Annual Meeting of the American Research Center in Egypt, Wyndham Toledo Hotel, Toledo, Ohio, Apr 20, 2007 The great popularity of the work is witnessed by the numerous surviving fragments.M. Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, Volume I: The Old and Middle Kingdoms, 1973, p.222, Sources There are a number of sources telling the Story of Sinuhe. A limestone ostracon (a pottery or stone fragment) in the Egyptian Museum is over a yard long, and is possibly the largest ostracon in existence. It tells the beginning of the Story of Sinuhe, and is inscribed in Hieratic. The story dates from the 12th Dynasty and the fragment was found in the tomb of Sennutem.A Guide to the Egyptian Museum, Cairo. Egyptian Museum, and al- Mathaf al-Misri. A Brief Description of the Principal Monuments = A Guide to the Egyptian Museum Cairo. 1968. Revised, enlarged by the General Egyptian Book Organization, 1982. Pages 93-94. Story of Sinuhe  Sinuhe is an official who accompanies prince Senwosret I to Libya. He overhears a conversation connected with the death of King Amenemhet I and as a result flees to Upper Retjenu (Canaan), leaving Egypt behind. He becomes the son-in- law of Chief Ammunenshi and in time his sons grow to become chiefs in their own right. Sinuhe fights rebellious tribes on behalf of Ammunenshi. As an old man, in the aftermath of defeating a powerful opponent in single combat, he prays for a return to his homeland: \\"May god pity me...may he hearken to the prayer of one far away!...may the King have mercy on me...may I be conducted to the city of eternity!\\" He then receives an invitation from King Senwosret I of Egypt to return, which he accepts in highly moving terms. Living out the rest of his life in royal favour, he is finally laid to rest in the necropolis in a beautiful tomb. Interpretations The Story of Sinuhe has spawned a great deal of literature which explores the themes contained in the work from many perspectives. The scope and variety of this material has been likened to the analysis of Hamlet and other notable works of literature. Scholars debate the reason why Sinuhe flees Egypt, with the majority ascribing panic over a perceived threat. The tale is full of symbolic allusions. Sinuhe's name (=\\"Son of the Sycamore\\") is seen as providing an important link in understanding the story. The sycamore is an ancient Egyptian Tree of Life,\\"Death and salvation in ancient Egypt\\", Jan Assmann, David Lorton, Translated by David Lorton, p171, Cornell University Press, 2005, associated with Hathor (the Goddess of fertility and rebirth and patroness of foreign countries), who features throughout the work. Sinuhe comes under the protective orbit of divine powers, in the form of the King, from whom he first tries to run away, and that of the Queen, a manifestation of Hathor. On fleeing Egypt, Sinuhe crosses a waterway associated with the Goddess Maat, the ancient Egyptian principle of truth, order and justice, in the vicinity of a sycamore tree. The ancient Egyptians believed in free will, implicit in the code of Maat, but this still allowed divine grace to work in and through the individual, and an overarching divine providence is seen in Sinuhe's flight and return to his homeland. Unable to escape the orbit of the gods' power and mercy, Sinuhe exclaims: \\"Whether I am in the Residence, or whether I am in this place, it is you who cover this horizon\\". Parallels have been made between the biblical narrative of Joseph and the Story of Sinuhe. In what is seen as divine providence, Sinuhe the Egyptian flees to Syro-Canaan and becomes a member of the ruling elite, acquires a wife and family, before being reunited with his Egyptian family. In what is seen as divine providence, the Syro-Canaanite Joseph is taken to Egypt where he becomes part of the ruling elite, acquires a wife and family, before being reunited with his Syro-Canaanite family. Parallels have also been drawn from other biblical texts: the Hebrew prophet Jonah's frustrated flight from the orbit of God's power is likened to Sinuhe's similar flight from the King.\\"God's Word for Our World: Theological and cultural studies in honor of Simon John De Vries\\", Simon John De Vries, Edmund S.

The story is based directly on the Story of Sinuhe, although adding details of a lovers' triangle romance that does not appear in the original. The story also formed part of the inspiration for the 1945 novel by Mika Waltari, and the 1954 Hollywood film epic, both titled The Egyptian, which although set during the reign of 18th Dynasty pharaoh Akhenaten, features a lead character named Sinuhe (played by Edmund Purdom) who flees Egypt in disgrace, to return after achieving material success and personal redemption in foreign lands. Elizabeth Peters made reference to the tale in her novel The Falcon at the Portal. Cuban songwriter and singer Silvio Rodriguez composed a song title \\"Sinuhe\\" (2003) included in his album A Date with the Angels (Cita con los Angeles original Spanish). The lyrics used the figure of Sinuhe as a metaphor of the past intellectual greatness of the Middle East and portrays a contrast with the contemporary conflicts and wars in the region.

Connective tissue is a broad term that includes bone, cartilage, fat, vascular, or hematopoietic tissues, and sarcomas can arise in any of these types of tissues. As a result, there are many subtypes of sarcoma, which are classified based on the specific tissue and type of cell from which the tumor originates. Sarcomas are primary connective tissue tumors, meaning that they arise in connective tissues. This is in contrast to secondary (or \\"metastatic\\") connective tissue tumors, which occur when a cancer from elsewhere in the body (such as the lungs, breast tissue or prostate) spreads to the connective tissue. The word sarcoma is derived from the Greek œÉŒ¨œÅŒ∫œâŒºŒ± sark≈çma \\"fleshy excrescence or substance\\", itself from œÉŒ¨œÅŒæ sarx meaning \\"flesh\\"., .  Classification  Sarcomas are typically divided into two major groups: bone sarcomas and soft-tissue sarcomas, each of which has multiple subtypes. In the United States, the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) publishes guidelines that classify the subtypes of sarcoma. These subtypes are as follows: =Subtypes of bone sarcoma= * Osteosarcoma * Chondrosarcoma * Poorly differentiated round/spindle cell tumors (includes Ewing sarcoma) * Hemangioendothelioma * Angiosarcoma * Fibrosarcoma/myofibrosarcoma * Chordoma * Adamantinoma * Other: ** Liposarcoma ** Leiomyosarcoma ** Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor ** Rhabdomyosarcoma ** Synovial sarcoma ** Malignant solitary fibrous tumor. =Subtypes of soft tissue sarcoma= * Liposarcoma (includes the following varieties: well-differentiated, not otherwise specified, de-differentiated, myxoid/round cell, and pleomorphic) * Atypical lipomatous tumor * Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (includes fibrosarcomatous and pigmented varieties) * Malignant solitary fibrous tumor * Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor * Low-grade myofibroblastic sarcoma * Fibrosarcoma (includes adult and sclerosing epithelioid varieties) * Myxofibrosarcoma (formerly myxoid malignant fibrous histiocytoma) * Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma * Giant cell tumor of soft tissues * Leiomyosarcoma * Malignant glomus tumor * Rhabdomyosarcoma (includes the following varieties: embryonal, alveolar, pleomorphic, and spindle cell/sclerosing) * Hemangioendothelioma (includes the following varieties: retiform, pseudomyogenic, and epithelioid) * Angiosarcoma of soft tissue * Extraskeletal osteosarcoma * Gastrointestinal stromal tumor, malignant (GIST) * Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (includes epithelioid variety) * Malignant Triton tumor * Malignant granular cell tumor * Malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor * Stromal sarcoma not otherwise specified * Myoepithelial carcinoma * Malignant phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor * Synovial sarcoma (includes the following varieties: spindle cell, biphasic, and not otherwise specified) * Epithelioid sarcoma * Alveolar soft part sarcoma * Clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue * Extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma * Extraskeletal Ewing sarcoma * Desmoplastic small round cell tumor * Extrarenal rhabdoid tumor * Perivascular epithelioid cell tumor, not otherwise specified * Intimal sarcoma * Undifferentiated spindle cell sarcoma * Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma * Undifferentiated round cell sarcoma * Undifferentiated epithelioid sarcoma * Undifferentiated sarcoma, not otherwise specified.  Signs and symptoms  Symptoms of bone sarcomas typically include bone pain, especially at night, and swelling around the site of the tumor. Symptoms of soft-tissue sarcomas vary, but they often present as firm, painless lumps or nodules. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (a subtype of soft tissue sarcoma) often are asymptomatic, but can be associated with vague complaints of abdominal pain, a feeling of fullness, or other signs of intestinal obstruction.  Cause = Causes and risk factors = The cause of most bone sarcomas is not known, but several factors are associated with an increased risk of developing bone sarcoma. Previous exposure to ionizing radiation (such as prior radiation therapy) is one such risk factor. Exposure to alkylating agents, such as those found in certain cancer chemotherapeutic medicines, also increases the risk of bone sarcoma. Certain inherited genetic syndromes, including Li-Fraumeni syndrome, heritable RB1 gene mutations, and Paget's disease of bone, are associated with an increased risk of developing bone sarcomas. Most soft tissue sarcomas arise from what doctors call \\"sporadic\\" (or random) genetic mutations within an affected person's cells. Nevertheless, there are certain risk factors associated with an increased risk of developing soft tissue sarcoma. Previous exposure to ionizing radiation is one such risk factor. Exposure to vinyl chloride (e.g., such as the fumes encountered in the production of polyethylene vinyl chloride (PVC)), arsenic and thorotrast all are associated with an increased risk of angiosarcoma. Lymphedema, such as that resulting from certain types of breast cancer treatment, also is a risk factor for development of angiosarcoma. As with bone sarcomas, certain inherited genetic syndromes also are associated with an increased risk of developing soft tissue sarcoma, including Li-Fraumeni syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, neurofibromatosis type 1, and heritable RB1 gene mutations.  Mechanisms  The mechanisms by which healthy cells transform into cancer cells are described in detail elsewhere (see Cancer main page; Carcinogenesis main page). The precise molecular changes that result in sarcoma are not always known, but certain types of sarcomas are associated with particular genetic mutations. Examples include: * Most cases of Ewing sarcoma are associated with a chromosomal translocation in which part of chromosome 11 fuses with part of chromosome 22. This results in the EWS gene becoming fused to other genes, including the FLI1 gene in 90% of Ewing cases and ERG gene in 5-10% of cases. These fusions result in the production of abnormal proteins, although how these abnormal proteins result in cancer is not fully known. * Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans often is associated with a chromosomal translocation in which the COL1A1 gene becomes fused to the PDGFRB gene. This results in over-active PDGF signaling, which is thought to promote cell division and ultimately lead to tumor development. * Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor often is associated with rearrangements of the ALK gene, and occasionally with rearrangements of the HMGA2 gene. * Giant cell tumor of soft tissue frequently is associated with a chromosomal translocation between chromosome 1 and chromosome 2, in which the CSF1 gene becomes fused with the COL6A3 gene. This results in increased CSF1 protein production, which is thought to play a role in cancer development. * Many liposarcomas are associated with duplication of part of chromosome 12, which results in extra copies of known cancer-promoting genes (\\"oncogenes\\") such as the CDK4 gene, the MDM2 gene and the HMGA2 gene. Diagnosis =Bone sarcomas= Diagnosis of bone sarcomas begins with a thorough history and physical examination which may reveal characteristic signs and symptoms (see Signs and Symptoms above). Laboratory studies are not particularly useful in diagnosis, although some bone sarcomas (such as osteosarcoma) may be associated with elevated alkaline phosphatase levels, while others (such as Ewing Sarcoma) can be associated with elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Importantly, however, none of these laboratory findings are specific to bone sarcomas, meaning that elevations in these lab values are associated with many other conditions as well as sarcoma, and thus cannot be relied upon to conclusively diagnose sarcoma. Imaging studies are critically important in diagnosis, and most clinicians will order a plain radiograph (X-ray) initially. Other imaging studies commonly used in diagnosis include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and radioisotope bone scans. Computed tomography (CT) imaging typically is not used in diagnosis of most types of bone sarcoma, although it is an important tool for staging (see below). Definitive diagnosis requires biopsy of the tumor and careful review of the biopsy specimen by an experienced pathologist. =Soft tissue sarcomas= Diagnosis of soft-tissue sarcomas also begins with a thorough history and physical examination. Imaging studies can include either CT or MRI, although CT tends to be preferred for soft tissue sarcomas located in the thorax, abdomen, or retroperitoneum. Positron emission tomography (PET) also may be useful in diagnosis, although its most common use is for staging (see below). As with bone sarcomas, definitive diagnosis requires biopsy of the tumor with evaluation of histology by a trained pathologist. = Staging = In general, cancer staging refers to how advanced a cancer is, and usually it is based upon factors such as tumor size and whether it has spread to other parts of the body. Staging is important because the stage affects the prognosis (likely outcome), as well as the types of treatments that are likely to be effective against the cancer. With sarcomas, staging requires a determination of whether the tumor has grown into surrounding tissues (\\"local invasion\\"), as well as imaging to determine whether it has spread (a process known as \\"metastasis\\") to lymph nodes (forming \\"nodal metastases\\") or to other tissues or organs in the body (forming \\"distant metastases\\"). The most common imaging tools used for staging bone sarcomas are MRI or CT to evaluate the primary tumor, contrast-enhanced CT of the chest to evaluate whether the cancer has spread (i.e., metastasized) to the lungs, and radioisotope bone scan to evaluate whether the cancer has spread to other bones. Staging for soft tissue sarcomas typically includes imaging of the primary tumor by MRI or CT to determine tumor size, as well as contrast-enhanced CT of the chest to evaluate for metastatic tumors in the lungs. =Grade= Like some other cancers, sarcomas are assigned a grade (low, intermediate, or high) based on the appearance of the tumor cells under a microscope. In general, grade refers to how aggressive the cancer is and how likely it is to spread to other parts of the body (\\"metastasize\\"). Low-grade sarcomas have a better prognosis than higher-grade sarcomas, and are usually treated surgically, although sometimes radiation therapy or chemotherapy are used. Intermediate- and high-grade sarcomas are more frequently treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. Since high-grade tumors are more likely to undergo metastasis (invasion and spread to locoregional and distant sites), they are treated more aggressively. The recognition that many sarcomas are sensitive to chemotherapy has dramatically improved the survival of patients. For example, in the era before chemotherapy, long-term survival for pediatric patients with localized osteosarcoma was only about 20%, but now has risen to 60‚Äì70%.  Prevention and screening  In the US, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) publishes guidelines recommending preventive screening for certain types of common cancers and other diseases. As of March 2019, the USPSTF does not recommend screening for sarcoma, possibly because it is a very rare type of cancer (see Epidemiology below). The American Cancer Society (ACS) also publishes guidelines recommending preventive screening for certain types of common cancers. Like the USPSTF, as of March 2019 ACS does not recommend preventive screening for sarcoma.  Treatment  Surgery is the most common form of the treatment for most sarcomas that have not spread to other parts of the body. Limb-sparing surgery, as opposed to amputation, can now be used to save the limbs of patients in at least 90% of extremity (arm or leg) sarcoma cases. Additional treatments, including chemotherapy, radiation therapy (also called \\"radiotherapy\\") and proton therapy, may be administered before surgery (called \\"neoadjuvant\\" chemotherapy or radiotherapy) or after surgery (called \\"adjuvant\\" chemotherapy or radiotherapy). The use of neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy significantly improves the prognosis for many sarcoma patients. Treatment can be a long and arduous process, lasting about a year for many patients. *Liposarcoma treatment consists of surgical resection, with chemotherapy not being used outside of the investigative setting. Adjuvant radiotherapy may also be used after surgical excision for liposarcoma. *Rhabdomyosarcoma is treated with surgery, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy. The majority of rhabdomyosarcoma patients have a 50‚Äì85% survival rate. *Osteosarcoma is a tumor of the bone that is treated with surgical resection of as much of the cancer as possible, often along with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Radiotherapy is a second alternative although not as successful. Expression of receptor B7-H3 provides a promising target for new immunotherapeutic strategies. In childhood sarcomas, the cytotoxic agent cyclophosphamide is widely used and has shown good anti-tumour efficacy. It is believed that higher doses of chemotherapy might improve survival. However, high doses of chemotherapy stop the production of blood cells in the bone marrow and can be harmful. Stem cells collected from people before high‚Äêdose chemotherapy can be transplanted back to the person if the blood cell count gets too low; this is called autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Research to investigate if using high‚Äêdose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was more favourable then standard‚Äêdose chemotherapy found only one RCT and this did not favour either of the two treatment arms with respect to overall survival. Further evidence is needed through well‚Äêdesigned clinical trials.  Prognosis  = Factors that affect prognosis = The AJCC has identified several factors that affect prognosis of bone sarcomas: * Size of the tumor: larger tumors tend to have a worse prognosis compared to smaller tumors. * Spread of tumor to surrounding tissues: tumors that have spread locally to surrounding tissues tend to have a worse prognosis compared to tumors that have not spread beyond their place of origin. * Stage and presence of metastases: tumors that have spread (\\"metastasized\\") to the lymph nodes (which is rare for bone sarcomas) or other organs or tissues (for example, to the lungs) have a worse prognosis compared to tumors that have not metastasized. * Tumor grade: higher grade tumors (grades 2 and 3) tend to have a worse prognosis compared to low grade (grade 1) tumors. * Skeletal location: tumors originating in the spine or pelvic bones tend to have a worse prognosis compared to tumors originating in arm or leg bones. For soft tissue sarcomas other than GISTs, factors that affect prognosis include: * Stage: as with bone sarcomas, tumors that have metastasized have a worse prognosis compared to tumors that have not metastasized. * Grade: the AJCC recommends using a grading system called the French Federation of Cancer Centers Sarcoma Group (FNCLCC) Grade for soft tissue sarcomas, with high-grade tumors having a worse prognosis compared to low-grade tumors. For GISTs, the key factor that affects prognosis is: * Mitotic rate: mitotic rate refers to the fraction of cells that are actively dividing within the tumor; GISTs that have a high mitotic rate have a worse prognosis compared to GISTs that have a low mitotic rate. = Outcome data = According to data published by the US National Cancer Institute (NCI), the overall 5-year survival for bone sarcomas is 66.9%. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that 1,660 people in the US will die in 2019 from bone sarcomas, accounting for 0.3% of all cancer deaths. The median age at death is 61 years old, although death can occur in any age group. Thus, 12.3% of bone sarcoma deaths occur in people under 20 years old, 13.8% occur in people 20‚Äì34 years old, 5.5% occur in people 35‚Äì44 years old, 9.3% occur in people 45‚Äì54 years old, 13.5% occur in people 55‚Äì64 years old, 16.2% occur in people 65‚Äì74 years old, 16.4% occur in people 75‚Äì84 years old, and 13.1% occur in people 85 years or older. For soft tissue sarcomas, the overall 5-year survival (irrespective of stage) is 64.5%, but survival is affected by many factors, including stage. Thus, the 5-year survival is 80.8% for soft tissue sarcomas that have not spread beyond the primary tumor (\\"localized\\" tumors), 58.0% for soft tissue sarcomas that have spread only to nearby lymph nodes, and 16.4% for soft tissue sarcomas that have spread to distant organs. The ACS estimates that 5,270 people will die from soft tissue sarcoma in 2019, accounting for 0.9% of all cancer deaths. Epidemiology Sarcomas are quite rare. The risk of a previously healthy person receiving a new diagnosis of bone cancer is less than 0.001%, while the risk of receiving a new diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma is between 0.0014-0.005%. The American Cancer Society estimates that in the United States there will be 3,500 new cases of bone sarcoma in 2019, and 12,750 new cases of soft tissue sarcoma. Considering that the total estimated number of new cancer diagnoses (all types of cancer) is 1,762,450, this means bone sarcomas represent only 0.2% of all new cancer diagnoses (making them the 30th most common type of cancer) and soft tissue sarcomas represent only 0.7% (making them the 22nd most common type of cancer) of all new cancer diagnoses in the US in 2019. These estimates are similar to previously reported data. Sarcomas affect people of all ages. Around 50% of bone sarcomas and 20% of soft-tissue sarcomas are diagnosed in people under the age of 35. Some sarcomas, such as leiomyosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), are more common in adults than in children. Most high-grade bone sarcomas, including Ewing's sarcoma and osteosarcoma, are much more common in children and young adults.  In fossils  In 2016, scientists reported the discovery of an osteosarcoma tumor in a 1.6-1.8 million-year-old fossil from the skeleton of now-extinct hominin species, making it the earliest-known case of human cancer.  Research  Treatment of sarcoma, especially when the sarcoma has spread, or \\"metastasized\\", often requires chemotherapy but existing chemotherapeutic medicines are associated with significant toxicities and are not highly effective in killing cancer cells. Therefore, research to identify new medications to treat sarcoma is being conducted . One possibility is the use of cancer immunotherapy (e.g., immune checkpoint inhibitors like anti-PD1, anti-PDL1, and anti-CTLA4 agents) to treat sarcomas. This is not yet an established treatment tool. Other strategies, such as small-molecule targeted therapy, biologic agents (e.g., small interfering RNA molecules), and nanoparticle-directed therapy, also are being investigated. Research to understand the specific genetic and molecular factors that cause sarcoma to develop is underway. This could allow for the design of new targeted therapies and allow physicians to more accurately predict a patient's prognosis. Presence of the H3-B3 immunoregulatory checkpoint receptor in the tumor cells provides the opportunity for clinical trial testing of new drugs and targeted agents and immunotherapies in development. Awareness In the US, July is widely recognized as Sarcoma Awareness Month. The UK has a Sarcoma Awareness Week in July led by Sarcoma UK, the bone and soft-tissue cancer charity.

It is homologous to the tympanic bone in mammals, due to the incorporation of several jaw bones into the mammalian middle ear early in mammal evolution. In therapsids (mammal ancestors and their kin), the lower jaw is made up of the dentary (the mandible in mammals) and a group of smaller \\"postdentary\\" bones near the jaw joint. As the dentary increased in size over million of years, two of these postdentary bones, the articular and angular, became increasingly reduced and the dentary eventually made direct contact with the upper jaw. These postdentary bones, even before their articular function was lost, probably transmitted sound vibrations to the stapes and, in some therapsids, a bent plate that might have supported a membrane capable of detecting vibrations developed on the angular. Eventually, it developed into the ectotympanic ring which supports the tympanic membrane in the ears of modern mammals.

Component video is a video signal that has been split into two or more component channels. In popular use, it refers to a type of component analog video (CAV) information that is transmitted or stored as three separate signals. Component video can be contrasted with composite video in which all the video information is combined into a single line level signal that is used in analog television. Like composite, component-video cables do not carry audio and are often paired with audio cables. When used without any other qualifications the term component video usually refers to analog component video with sync on luma. Analog component video Reproducing a video signal on a display device (for example, a cathode ray tube; CRT) is a straightforward process complicated by the multitude of signal sources. DVD, VHS, computers and video game consoles all store, process and transmit video signals using different methods, and often each will provide more than one signal option. One way of maintaining signal clarity is by separating the components of a video signal so that they do not interfere with each other. A signal separated in this way is called \\"component video\\". S-Video, RGB and signals comprise two or more separate signals, and thus are all component- video signals. For most consumer-level video applications, the common three- cable system using BNC or RCA connectors analog component video was used. Typical resolutions (in lines) are 480i (visible, 525 full for NTSC)This is 720√ó480 display format. and 576i (visible, 625 full for PAL). For personal computer displays the 15 pin DIN connector (IBM VGA) provided screen resolutions including 640√ó480, 800√ó600, 1024√ó768, 1152√ó864, 1280√ó1024 and much larger. =RGB analog component video= A 15-pin VGA connector for a personal computer A 21-pin SCART or JP21 connector The various RGB (red, green, blue) analog component video standards (e.g., RGBS, RGBHV, RGsB) use no compression and impose no real limit on color depth or resolution, but require large bandwidth to carry the signal and contain a lot of redundant data since each channel typically includes much of the same black-and-white image. At one time computers offered this signal via a VGA port. Many televisions, especially in Europe, utilize RGB via the SCART connector. All arcade video games, other than early vector and black-and-white games, use RGB monitors. In addition to the red, green and blue color signals, RGB requires two additional signals to synchronize the video display. Several methods are used: * composite sync, where the horizontal and vertical signals are mixed together on a separate wire (the S in RGBS) * separate sync, where the horizontal and vertical are each on their own wire (the H and V in RGBHV; also the acronym HD/VD, meaning horizontal deflection/vertical deflection, is used) * sync on green, where a composite sync signal is overlaid on the wire used to transport the green signal (SoG, Sync on G, or RGsB). * sync on red or sync on blue, where a composite sync signal is overlaid on either the red or blue wire * sync on composite (not to be confused with composite sync), where the signal normally used for composite video is used alongside the RGB signal only for the purposes of sync. * sync on luma, where the Y signal from S-Video is used alongside the RGB signal only for the purposes of sync. Composite sync is common in the European SCART connection scheme (using pins 17 [ground] and 19 [composite-out] or 20 [composite-in]). RGBS requires four wires ‚Äì red, green, blue and sync. If separate cables are used, the sync cable is usually colored yellow (as is the standard for composite video) or white. Separate sync is most common with VGA, used worldwide for analog computer monitors. This is sometimes known as RGBHV, as the horizontal and vertical synchronization pulses are sent in separate channels. This mode requires five conductors. If separate cables are used, the sync lines are usually yellow (H) and white (V), yellow (H) and black (V), or gray (H) and black (V). Sync on Green (SoG) is less common, and while some VGA monitors support it, most do not. Sony is a big proponent of SoG, and most of their monitors (and their PlayStation line of video game consoles) use it. Like devices that use composite video or S-video, SoG devices require additional circuitry to remove the sync signal from the green line. A monitor that is not equipped to handle SoG will display an image with an extreme green tint, if any image at all, when given a SoG input. Sync on red and sync on blue are even rarer than sync on green, and are typically used only in certain specialized equipment. Sync on composite, not to be confused with composite sync, is commonly used on devices that output both composite video and RGB over SCART. The RGB signal is used for color information, while the composite video signal is only used to extract the sync information. This is generally an inferior sync method, as this often causes checkerboards to appear on an image, but the image quality is still much sharper than standalone composite video. Sync on luma is much similar to sync on composite, but uses the Y signal from S-Video instead of a composite video signal. This is sometimes used on SCART, since both composite video and S-Video luma ride along the same pins. This generally does not suffer from the same checkerboard issue as sync on composite, and is generally acceptable on devices that do not feature composite sync, such as the Sony PlayStation and some modded Nintendo 64 models. = Luma-based analog component video = component video out on a consumer electronics device Further types of component analog video signals do not use separate red, green and blue components but rather a colorless component, termed luma, which provides brightness information (as in black-and-white video). This combines with one or more color-carrying components, termed chroma, that give only color information. Both the S-Video component video output (two separate signals) and the component video output (three separate signals) seen on DVD players are examples of this method. Converting video into luma and chroma allows for chroma subsampling, a method used by JPEG and MPEG compression schemes to reduce the storage requirements for images and video (respectively). Many consumer TVs, DVD players, monitors, video projectors and other video devices at one time used output or input. When used for connecting a video source to a video display where both support 4:3 and 16:9 display formats, the PAL television standard provides for signaling pulses that will automatically switch the display from one format to the other. Connectors used *D-Terminal: Used mostly on Japanese electronics. *Three BNC (professional) or RCA connectors (consumer): Typically colored green (Y), blue (PB) and red (PR). *SCART used in Europe. *Video In Video Out (VIVO): 9-pin Mini-DIN- connectors called \\"TV Out\\" in computer video cards, which usually include an adaptor for component RCA, composite RCA and 4-pin S-Video-Mini-DIN. Digital component video: DVI and HDMI Digital component video makes use of single cables with signal lines/connector pins dedicated to digital signals, transmitting digital color space values allowing higher resolutions such as 480p, 480i, 576i, 576p, 720p, 1080i, and 1080p. RGB component video has largely been replaced by modern digital formats, such as DisplayPort or Digital Visual Interface (DVI) digital connections, while home theater systems increasingly favor High-Definition Multimedia Interface (HDMI), which support higher resolutions, higher dynamic range, and can be made to support digital rights management. The demise of analog is largely due to screens moving to large flat digital panels as well as the desire for having a single cable for both audio and video, but also due to a slight loss of clarity when converting from a digital media source to analog and back again for a flat digital display, particularly when used at higher resolutions where analog signals are highly susceptible to noise.  International standards  Examples of international component video standards are: *RS-170 RGB (525 lines, based on NTSC timings, now EIA/TIA-343) *RS-343 RGB (525, 625 or 875 lines) *STANAG 3350 Analogue Video Standard (NATO military version of RS-343 RGB, now EIA-343A) *CEA-770.3 High Definition TV Analog Component Video Interface Consumer Electronics Association Component versus composite In a composite signal, such as NTSC, PAL or SECAM, the luminance, Brightness (Y) signal and the chrominance, Color (C) signals are encoded together into one signal. When the color components are kept as separate signals, the video is called component analog video (CAV), which requires three separate signals: the luminance signal (Y) and the color difference signals (R-Y and B-Y). Since component video does not undergo the encoding process, the color quality is noticeably better than composite video. Component video connectors are not unique in that the same connectors are used for several different standards; hence, making a component video connection often does not lead to a satisfactory video signal being transferred. Many DVD players and TVs may need to be set to indicate the type of input/output being used, and if set incorrectly the image may not be properly displayed. Progressive scan, for example, is often not enabled by default, even when component video output is selected.

It started in 1966 as a national holiday and was held on every September 15. Since 2003, Respect for the Aged Day is held on the third Monday of September due to the Happy Monday System. This national holiday traces its origins to 1947, when Nomadani-mura (later Yachiyo-cho, currently Taka-cho), Hy≈çgo Prefecture, proclaimed September 15 Old Folks' Day (Toshiyori no Hi). Its popularity spread nationwide, and in 1966 it took its present name and status. Annually, Japanese media take the opportunity to feature the elderly, reporting on the population and highlighting the oldest people in the country. Commemorative silver sake cups Since 1963, the Japanese government has given a commemorative silver sake cup to Japanese who reach the age of 100. In 1963 the number was 153, but with numbers increasing, the government decided to reduce the size of the cup to cut costs in 2009. In 2014 29,357 received a cup. In 2017, Japan honored 32,097 people (27,461 women and 4,636 men) who turned 100-years old; they each received congratulatory letter and souvenir sake cup from the Prime Minister. According to this report the solid sterling silver cups were replaced with nickel alloy silver plated design which halved per unit cost saving $1-million annual budget.  Celebration  On this holiday, people return home to visit and pay respect to the elders. Some people volunteer in neighborhoods by making and distributing free lunch boxes to older citizens. Entertainments are sometimes provided by teenagers and children with various keirokai performances. Special television programs are also featured by Japanese media on this holiday.

In the standard Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram, these stars lie above and to the right of the main sequence. The term applies to a variety of stars in different phases of development, all evolved stars that have moved from the main sequence but have little else in common, so blue giant simply refers to stars in a particular region of the HR diagram rather than a specific type of star. They are much rarer than red giants, because they only develop from more massive and less common stars, and because they have short lives in the blue giant stage. The name blue giant is sometimes misapplied to other high-mass luminous stars, such as main-sequence stars, simply because they are large and hot. Properties Blue giant Bellatrix compared to Algol B, the Sun, a red dwarf, and some planets. Blue giant is not a strictly defined term and it is applied to a wide variety of different types of stars. What they have in common is: a moderate increase in size and luminosity compared to main-sequence stars of the same mass or temperature, and are hot enough to be called blue, meaning spectral class O, B, and sometimes early A. They have temperatures from around 10,000 K upwards, zero age main sequence (ZAMS) masses greater than about twice the Sun (), and absolute magnitudes around 0 or brighter. These stars are only 5‚Äì10 times the radius of the Sun (), compared to red giants which are up to . The coolest and least luminous stars referred to as blue giants are on the horizontal branch, intermediate-mass stars that have passed through a red giant phase and are now burning helium in their cores. Depending on mass and chemical composition these stars gradually move blue wards until they exhaust the helium in their cores and then they return redwards to the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). The RR Lyrae variable stars, usually with spectral types of A, lie across the middle of the horizontal branch. Horizontal-branch stars hotter than the RR Lyrae gap are generally considered to be blue giants, and sometimes the RR Lyrae stars themselves are called blue giants despite some of them being F class. The hottest stars, blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars, are called extreme horizontal branch (EHB) stars and can be hotter than main-sequence stars of the same luminosity. In these cases they are called blue subdwarf (sdB) stars rather than blue giants, named for their position to the left of the main sequence on the HR diagram rather than for their increased luminosity and temperature compared to when they were themselves main-sequence stars. There are no strict upper limits for giant stars, but early O types become increasingly difficult to classify separately from main sequence and supergiant stars, have almost identical sizes and temperatures to the main- sequence stars from which they develop, and very short lifetimes. A good example is Plaskett's star, a close binary consisting of two O type giants both over , temperatures over 30,000 K, and more than 100,000 times the luminosity of the Sun (). Astronomers still differ over whether to classify at least one of the stars as a supergiant, based on subtle differences in the spectral lines. Evolution Stars found in the blue giant region of the HR diagram can be in very different stages of their lives, but all are evolved stars that have largely exhausted their core hydrogen supplies. In the simplest case, a hot luminous star begins to expand as its core hydrogen is exhausted, and first becomes a blue subgiant then a blue giant, becoming both cooler and more luminous. Intermediate-mass stars will continue to expand and cool until they become red giants. Massive stars also continue to expand as hydrogen shell burning progresses, but they do so at approximately constant luminosity and move horizontally across the HR diagram. In this way they can quickly pass through blue giant, bright blue giant, blue supergiant, and yellow supergiant classes, until they become red supergiants. The luminosity class for such stars is determined from spectral lines that are sensitive to the surface gravity of the star, with more expanded and luminous stars being given I (supergiant) classifications while somewhat less expanded and more luminous stars are given luminosity II or III. Because they are massive stars with short lives, many blue giants are found in O-B associations, that are large collections of loosely bound young stars. BHB stars are more evolved and have helium burning cores, although they still have an extensive hydrogen envelope. They also have moderate masses around so they are often much older than more massive blue giants. The BHB takes its name from the prominent horizontal grouping of stars seen on colour-magnitude diagrams for older clusters, where core helium burning stars of the same age are found at a variety of temperatures with roughly the same luminosity. These stars also evolve through the core helium burning stage at constant luminosity, first increasing in temperature then decreasing again as they move toward the AGB. However, at the blue end of the horizontal branch, it forms a \\"blue tail\\" of stars with lower luminosity, and occasionally a \\"blue hook\\" of even hotter stars. There are other highly evolved hot stars not generally referred to as blue giants: Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars, highly luminous and distinguished by their extreme temperatures and prominent helium and nitrogen emission lines; post- AGB stars forming planetary nebulae, similar to Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars but smaller and less massive; blue stragglers, uncommon luminous blue stars observed apparently on the main sequence in clusters where main-sequence stars of their luminosity should have evolved into giants or supergiants; and the true blue supergiants, the most massive stars evolved beyond blue giants and identified by the effects of greater expansion on their spectra. A purely theoretical group of stars could be formed when red dwarfs finally exhaust their core hydrogen trillions of years into the future. These stars are convective through their depth and are expected to very slowly increase both their temperature and luminosity as they accumulate more and more helium until eventually they cannot sustain fusion and they quickly collapse to white dwarfs. Although these stars can become hotter than the Sun they will never become more luminous, so are hardly blue giants as we see them today. The name blue dwarf has been coined although that name could easily be confusing.

They have luminosity class I and spectral class B9 or earlier. Blue supergiants are found towards the top left of the Hertzsprung‚ÄìRussell diagram, above and to the right of the main sequence. They are larger than the Sun but smaller than a red supergiant, with surface temperatures of 10,000‚Äì50,000 K and luminosities from about 10,000 to a million times that of the Sun. Formation Rigel and the IC 2118 nebula which it illuminates. Supergiants are evolved high-mass stars, larger and more luminous than main- sequence stars. O class and early B class stars with initial masses around evolve away from the main sequence in just a few million years as their hydrogen is consumed and heavy elements start to appear near the surface of the star. These stars usually become blue supergiants, although it is possible that some of them evolve directly to Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars. Expansion into the supergiant stage occurs when hydrogen in the core of the star is depleted and hydrogen shell burning starts, but it may also be caused as heavy elements are dredged up to the surface by convection and mass loss due to radiation pressure increase. Blue supergiants are newly evolved from the main sequence, have extremely high luminosities, high mass loss rates, and are generally unstable. Many of them become luminous blue variables (LBVs) with episodes of extreme mass loss. Lower mass blue supergiants continue to expand until they become red supergiants. In the process they must spend some time as yellow supergiants or yellow hypergiants, but this expansion occurs in just a few thousand years and so these stars are rare. Higher mass red supergiants blow away their outer atmospheres and evolve back to blue supergiants, and possibly onwards to Wolf‚ÄìRayet stars. Depending on the exact mass and composition of a red supergiant, it can execute a number of blue loops before either exploding as a type II supernova or finally dumping enough of its outer layers to become a blue supergiant again, less luminous than the first time but more unstable. If such a star can pass through the yellow evolutionary void it is expected that it becomes one of the lower luminosity LBVs. The most massive blue supergiants are too luminous to retain an extensive atmosphere and they never expand into a red supergiant. The dividing line is approximately , although the coolest and largest red supergiants develop from stars with initial masses of . It is not clear whether more massive blue supergiants can lose enough mass to evolve safely into old age as a Wolf Rayet star and finally a white dwarf, or they reach the Wolf Rayet stage and explode as supernovae, or they explode as supernovae while blue supergiants. Supernova progenitors are most commonly red supergiants and it was believed that only red supergiants could explode as supernovae. SN 1987A, however, forced astronomers to re-examine this theory, as its progenitor, Sanduleak -69¬∞ 202, was a B3 blue supergiant. Now it is known from observation that almost any class of evolved high-mass star, including blue and yellow supergiants, can explode as a supernova although theory still struggles to explain how in detail. While most supernovae are of the relatively homogeneous type II-P and are produced by red supergiants, blue supergiants are observed to produce supernovae with a wide range of luminosities, durations, and spectral types, sometimes sub-luminous like SN 1987A, sometimes super-luminous such as many type IIn supernovae. Properties Spectrum of a B2 star. Because of their extreme masses they have relatively short lifespans and are mainly observed in young cosmic structures such as open clusters, the arms of spiral galaxies, and in irregular galaxies. They are rarely observed in spiral galaxy cores, elliptical galaxies, or globular clusters, most of which are believed to be composed of older stars, although the core of the Milky Way has recently been found to be home to several massive open clusters and associated young hot stars. The best known example is Rigel, the brightest star in the constellation of Orion. Its mass is about 20 times that of the Sun, and its luminosity is around 117,000 times greater. Despite their rarity and their short lives they are heavily represented among the stars visible to the naked eye; their immense brightness is more than enough to compensate for their scarcity. Blue supergiants have fast stellar winds and the most luminous, called hypergiants, have spectra dominated by emission lines that indicate strong continuum driven mass loss. Blue supergiants show varying quantities of heavy elements in their spectra, depending on their age and the efficiency with which the products of nucleosynthesis in the core are convected up to the surface. Quickly rotating supergiants can be highly mixed and show high proportions of helium and even heavier elements while still burning hydrogen at the core; these stars show spectra very similar to a Wolf Rayet star. While the stellar wind from a red supergiant is dense and slow, the wind from a blue supergiant is fast but sparse. When a red supergiant becomes a blue supergiant, the faster wind it produces impacts the already emitted slow wind and causes the outflowing material to condense into a thin shell. In some cases several concentric faint shells can be seen from successive episodes of mass loss, either previous blue loops from the red supergiant stage, or eruptions such as LBV outbursts.

This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. Burbeck (1992): \\"... the user input, the modeling of the external world, and the visual feedback to the user are explicitly separated and handled by three types of object.\\" Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this pattern has become popular for designing web applications. Popular programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java, C#, and Swift have MVC frameworks that are used for web or mobile application development straight out of the box. __TOC__ Components ;Model :The central component of the pattern.

It receives user input from the controller. * The view means presentation of the model in a particular format. * The controller responds to the user input and performs interactions on the data model objects.

As with other software patterns, MVC expresses the \\"core of the solution\\" to a problem while allowing it to be adapted for each system.Gamma, Erich et al. (1994) Design Patterns Particular MVC designs can vary significantly from the traditional description here.Moore, Dana et al. (2007) Professional Rich Internet Applications: Ajax and Beyond: \\"Since the origin of MVC, there have been many interpretations of the pattern. The concept has been adapted and applied in very different ways to a wide variety of systems and architectures.\\" History One of the seminal insights in the early development of graphical user interfaces, MVC became one of the first approaches to describe and implement software constructs in terms of their responsibilities.Model‚ÄìView‚ÄìController History.

Trygve Reenskaug introduced MVC into Smalltalk-79 while visiting the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC)Notes and Historical documents from Trygve Reenskaug, inventor of MVC.\\"A note on DynaBook requirements\\", Trygve Reenskaug, 22 March 1979, SysReq.pdf. in the 1970s. In the 1980s, Jim Althoff and others implemented a version of MVC for the Smalltalk-80 class library.

The use of the MVC pattern in web applications exploded in popularity after the introduction of NeXT's WebObjects in 1996, which was originally written in Objective-C (that borrowed heavily from Smalltalk) and helped enforce MVC principles. Later, the MVC pattern became popular with Java developers when WebObjects was ported to Java. Later frameworks for Java, such as Spring (released in October 2002), continued the strong bond between Java and MVC. The introduction of the frameworks Django (July 2005, for Python) and Rails (December 2005, for Ruby), both of which had a strong emphasis on rapid deployment, increased MVC's popularity outside the traditional enterprise environment in which it has long been popular. MVC web frameworks now hold large market-shares relative to non-MVC web toolkits. Use in web applications Although originally developed for desktop computing, MVC has been widely adopted as a design for World Wide Web applications in major programming languages. Several web frameworks have been created that enforce the pattern. These software frameworks vary in their interpretations, mainly in the way that the MVC responsibilities are divided between the client and server. Some web MVC frameworks take a thin client approach that places almost the entire model, view and controller logic on the server. This is reflected in frameworks such as Django, Rails and ASP.NET MVC. In this approach, the client sends either hyperlink requests or form submissions to the controller and then receives a complete and updated web page (or other document) from the view; the model exists entirely on the server. Other frameworks such as AngularJS, EmberJS, JavaScriptMVC and Backbone allow the MVC components to execute partly on the client (also see Ajax).

The term 'union station' is used in North America and 'joint station' is used in Europe. In the U.S., union stations are typically used by all the passenger trains serving a city, although exceptions exist. For example, in Chicago, the Illinois Central and Chicago & North Western depots coexisted with Union Station, and although most Metra commuter trains (and all Amtrak services) continue to use Union Station today, some lines depart from other terminals, such as Ogilvie Transportation Center or Millennium Station. The busiest station to be named \\"Union Station\\" is Toronto Union Station, which serves over 72 million passengers annually. https://web.archive.org/web/20150811073230/https://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=5e05962c8c3f0410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD The first union station building was Columbus Union Station in 1851, though Indianapolis Union Station, planned in 1848 and built in 1853, had more elements of a cooperative union station.  Europe  In most countries in Europe, throughout much of the 20th century, railways have been owned and operated by state enterprises. Where only one railway company exists, there is no need for a \\"joint station\\". However, before nationalisation many companies existed and sometimes they had \\"joint stations\\". In some cases this persists today. \\"Joint stations\\" are often found near borders where two state-owned railway companies meet. = Austria, Germany, and Switzerland = In German- speaking countries, the similar term Gemeinschaftsbahnhof is used in administrative language only; it applies for stations with joint facilities as well as for stations with side-by-side facilities; some border stations also fall under that term. The general public often call them \\"Hauptbahnhof\\" (main station), but this is a misnomer, as stations administratively classified as \\"Hauptbahnhof\\" need not be served by multiple operators. Many major stations in Germany are served by various trains operated by incumbent Deutsche Bahn and other railways that operate local passenger trains, sometimes also by railway companies of neighbor states that operate trans-border connections; a special term like union station is usually not used. The stations are generally owned and operated by DB Station&Service.; As another example, Leipzig Hauptbahnhof, the main station of Leipzig, originally consisted of side-by-side parts that were used by the Prussian and Saxonian Railways until the federal Deutsche Reichsbahn was founded in 1920, but were essentially two stations operated separately by the two neighbors. = Bohemia and Moravia = In Bohemia (part of the territory of the Czech Republic today) some stations were called the \\"spoleƒçn√© n√°dra≈æ√≠\\" (the common station) before the state took over the private railway companies. \\"Praha-Sm√≠chov spoleƒçn√© n√°dra≈æ√≠\\" is to this day the functional name of the second station built in 1872 by the same investor near the first station Sm√≠chov of the Pra≈æsk√° z√°padn√≠ dr√°ha (Prague Western Railroad). The new station served as the main marshalling yard of Prague. Three routes flowed into it: Pra≈æsk√° spojovac√≠ dr√°ha (the Prague Connecting Railroad, 1872), the extension of Bu≈°tƒõhradsk√° dr√°ha from Hostivice (1872) and Pra≈æsko-duchcovsk√° dr√°ha (the Railroad Prague ‚Äì Duchcov, 1873). Nowadays the \\"spoleƒçn√© n√°dra≈æ√≠\\" forms an unremarkable separate platform of the station Praha-Sm√≠chov, known in timetables as \\"Praha-Sm√≠chov severn√≠ n√°stupi≈°tƒõ\\" (the northern platform). \\"Spoleƒçn√© n√°dra≈æ√≠\\" was built 1845‚Äì1848 at Brno. \\"Spoleƒçn√© n√°dra≈æ√≠\\" was at ≈Ωelezn√° Ruda as well, station at border Bavaria ‚Äì Austro-Hungarian Empire. It was in operation 1878‚Äì1938. Nowadays the largest stations are called \\"hlavn√≠ n√°dra≈æ√≠\\" (main station). = United Kingdom = In the United Kingdom, before the railways were nationalised in 1948, stations shared by multiple operators were referred to as \\"joint stations\\". This term has occasionally been revived since the railways were returned to the private sector in the 1990s, but is not as familiar or as well understood as \\"union station\\" is in the United States.  North America  In North America, a union station is usually owned by a separate corporation whose shares are owned by the different railways which use it, so that the costs and benefits of its operations are shared proportionately among them. This contrasts with the system of trackage rights or running rights, where one railway company owns a line or facility, but allows another company to share it under a contractual agreement.

Biography Born in Pachino, Syracuse, Brancati studied in Catania, where he graduated in letters and where he spent the most part of his life. While he started writing at young age and at 25 years old he was already the author of six books, which were largely influenced by fascist ideals and which were later rejected by the same Brancati, critics tend to set the starting point of his career in 1935, when he released the collection of short stories In search of a cause. Brancati got his first and probably major success in 1941, with the novel Don Giovanni in Sicilia, a vibrant and humorous portrait of the Sicilian temperament. In 1944 he wrote the novel Gli anni perduti (\\"The Lost Years\\"), a bold satire of Benito Mussolini's megalomania, and in 1946 Vecchio con gli stivali (\\"Old Man in Boots\\"), a satirical short story inspired by the vicissitudes of the Italian fascism which won the Vendemmia Award and which was adapted into a successful film, Difficult Years by Luigi Zampa. In 1950 he won the Bagutta Prize with one another well-known novel, Il bell'Antonio (\\"The Handsome Antonio\\"). He died in a clinic in Turin after a major surgery.

In particular it implies that every Riemann surface admits a Riemannian metric of constant curvature. For compact Riemann surfaces, those with universal cover the unit disk are precisely the hyperbolic surfaces of genus greater than 1, all with non-abelian fundamental group; those with universal cover the complex plane are the Riemann surfaces of genus 1, namely the complex tori or elliptic curves with fundamental group ; and those with universal cover the Riemann sphere are those of genus zero, namely the Riemann sphere itself, with trivial fundamental group. The uniformization theorem is a generalization of the Riemann mapping theorem from proper simply connected open subsets of the plane to arbitrary simply connected Riemann surfaces. The uniformization theorem also has an equivalent statement in terms of closed Riemannian 2-manifolds: each such manifold has a conformally equivalent Riemannian metric with constant curvature. Many classical proofs of the uniformization theorem rely on constructing a real-valued harmonic function on the simply connected Riemann surface, possibly with a singularity at one or two points and often corresponding to a form of Green's function. Four methods of constructing the harmonic function are widely employed: the Perron method; the Schwarz alternating method; Dirichlet's principle; and Weyl's method of orthogonal projection. In the context of closed Riemannian 2-manifolds, several modern proofs invoke nonlinear differential equations on the space of conformally equivalent metrics. These include the Beltrami equation from Teichm√ºller theory and an equivalent formulation in terms of harmonic maps; Liouville's equation, already studied by Poincar√©; and Ricci flow along with other nonlinear flows. History Felix and Henri conjectured the uniformization theorem for (the Riemann surfaces of) algebraic curves. extended this to arbitrary multivalued analytic functions and gave informal arguments in its favor. The first rigorous proofs of the general uniformization theorem were given by and . Paul Koebe later gave several more proofs and generalizations. The history is described in ; a complete account of uniformization up to the 1907 papers of Koebe and Poincar√© is given with detailed proofs in (the Bourbaki-type pseudonym of the group of fifteen mathematicians who jointly produced this publication). Classification of connected Riemann surfaces Every Riemann surface is the quotient of free, proper and holomorphic action of a discrete group on its universal covering and this universal covering is holomorphically isomorphic (one also says: \\"conformally equivalent\\" or \\"biholomorphic\\") to one of the following: #the Riemann sphere #the complex plane #the unit disk in the complex plane. Rado's theorem shows that every Riemann surface is automatically second-countable. Although Rado's theorem is often used in proofs of the uniformization theorem, some proofs have been formulated so that Rado's theorem becomes a consequence. Second countability is automatic for compact Riemann surfaces. Classification of closed oriented Riemannian 2-manifolds On an oriented 2-manifold, a Riemannian metric induces a complex structure using the passage to isothermal coordinates. If the Riemannian metric is given locally as : ds^2 = E \\\\, dx^2 + 2F \\\\, dx \\\\, dy + G \\\\, dy^2, then in the complex coordinate z = x + iy, it takes the form : ds^2 = \\\\lambdadz +\\\\mu \\\\, d\\\\overline{z}^2, where : \\\\lambda={1\\\\over 4} \\\\left( E + G +2\\\\sqrt{EG -F^2} \\\\right), \\\\,\\\\,\\\\, \\\\mu=(E - G + 2iF)/4\\\\lambda, so that Œª and Œº are smooth with Œª > 0 and Œº < 1\\\\. In isothermal coordinates (u, v) the metric should take the form : ds^2 = \\\\rho (du^2 + dv^2) with œÅ > 0 smooth. The complex coordinate w = u + i v satisfies :\\\\rho \\\\, dw^2 = \\\\rho w_z^2 \\\\left dz + {w_{\\\\overline {z}}\\\\over w_z} \\\\, d\\\\overline{z}\\\\right^2, so that the coordinates (u, v) will be isothermal locally provided the Beltrami equation : {\\\\partial w\\\\over \\\\partial \\\\overline{z}} = \\\\mu {\\\\partial w\\\\over \\\\partial z} has a locally diffeomorphic solution, i.e. a solution with non-vanishing Jacobian. These conditions can be phrased equivalently in terms of the exterior derivative and the Hodge star operator .; and will be isothermal coordinates if , where is defined on differentials by . Let be the Laplace-Beltrami operator. By standard elliptic theory, can be chosen to be harmonic near a given point, i.e. , with non-vanishing. By the Poincar√© lemma has a local solution exactly when . This condition is equivalent to , so can always be solved locally. Since is non-zero and the square of the Hodge star operator is ‚àí1 on 1-forms, and must be linearly independent, so that and give local isothermal coordinates. The existence of isothermal coordinates can be proved by other methods, for example using the general theory of the Beltrami equation, as in , or by direct elementary methods, as in and . From this correspondence with compact Riemann surfaces, a classification of closed orientable Riemannian 2-manifolds follows. Each such is conformally equivalent to a unique closed 2-manifold of constant curvature, so a quotient of one of the following by a free action of a discrete subgroup of an isometry group: #the sphere (curvature +1) #the Euclidean plane (curvature 0) #the hyperbolic plane (curvature ‚àí1). File:Orange Sphere.pnggenus 0 File:Orange Torus.pnggenus 1 File:Orange Genus 2 Surface.pnggenus 2 File:Orange Genus 3 Surface.pnggenus 3 The first case gives the 2-sphere, the unique 2-manifold with constant positive curvature and hence positive Euler characteristic (equal to 2). The second gives all flat 2-manifolds, i.e. the tori, which have Euler characteristic 0. The third case covers all 2-manifolds of constant negative curvature, i.e. the hyperbolic 2-manifolds all of which have negative Euler characteristic. The classification is consistent with the Gauss‚ÄìBonnet theorem, which implies that for a closed surface with constant curvature, the sign of that curvature must match the sign of the Euler characteristic. The Euler characteristic is equal to 2 ‚Äì 2g, where g is the genus of the 2-manifold, i.e. the number of \\"holes\\". Methods of proof =Hilbert space methods= In 1913 Hermann Weyl published his classic textbook \\"Die Idee der Riemannschen Fl√§che\\" based on his G√∂ttingen lectures from 1911 to 1912. It was the first book to present the theory of Riemann surfaces in a modern setting and through its three editions has remained influential. Dedicated to Felix Klein, the first edition incorporated Hilbert's treatment of the Dirichlet problem using Hilbert space techniques; Brouwer's contributions to topology; and Koebe's proof of the uniformization theorem and its subsequent improvements. Much later developed his method of orthogonal projection which gave a streamlined approach to the Dirichlet problem, also based on Hilbert space; that theory, which included Weyl's lemma on elliptic regularity, was related to Hodge's theory of harmonic integrals; and both theories were subsumed into the modern theory of elliptic operators and Sobolev spaces. In the third edition of his book from 1955, translated into English in , Weyl adopted the modern definition of differential manifold, in preference to triangulations, but decided not to make use of his method of orthogonal projection. followed Weyl's account of the uniformisation theorem, but used the method of orthogonal projection to treat the Dirichlet problem. This approach will be outlined below. describes the approach in Weyl's book and also how to shorten it using the method of orthogonal projection. A related account can be found in . =Nonlinear flows= In introducing the Ricci flow, Richard S. Hamilton showed that the Ricci flow on a closed surface uniformizes the metric (i.e., the flow converges to a constant curvature metric). However, his proof relied on the uniformization theorem. The missing step involved Ricci flow on the 2-sphere: a method for avoiding an appeal to the uniformization theorem (for genus 0) was provided by ; a short self-contained account of Ricci flow on the 2-sphere was given in . Generalizations Koebe proved the general uniformization theorem that if a Riemann surface is homeomorphic to an open subset of the complex sphere (or equivalently if every Jordan curve separates it), then it is conformally equivalent to an open subset of the complex sphere. In 3 dimensions, there are 8 geometries, called the eight Thurston geometries. Not every 3-manifold admits a geometry, but Thurston's geometrization conjecture proved by Grigori Perelman states that every 3-manifold can be cut into pieces that are geometrizable. The simultaneous uniformization theorem of Lipman Bers shows that it is possible to simultaneously uniformize two compact Riemann surfaces of the same genus >1 with the same quasi-Fuchsian group. The measurable Riemann mapping theorem shows more generally that the map to an open subset of the complex sphere in the uniformization theorem can be chosen to be a quasiconformal map with any given bounded measurable Beltrami coefficient.

The idea of astral travel is ancient and occurs in multiple cultures. The modern terminology of \\"astral projection\\" was coined and promoted by 19th-century Theosophists. It is sometimes reported in association with dreams, and forms of meditation. Some individuals have reported perceptions similar to descriptions of astral projection that were induced through various hallucinogenic and hypnotic means (including self-hypnosis). There is no scientific evidence that there is a consciousness or soul which is separate from normal neural activity or that one can consciously leave the body and make observations,Brian Regal. (2009). Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia. Greenwood. p. 29. \\"Other than anecdotal eyewitness accounts, there is no known evidence of the ability to astral project, the existence of other planes, or of the Akashic Record.\\" and astral projection has been characterized as a pseudoscience.Terence Hines. (2003). Pseudoscience and the Paranormal. Prometheus Books. pp. 103-106. Robert L. Park. (2008). Superstition: Belief in the Age of Sciences. Princeton University Press. pp. 90-91. . Accounts =Western= According to classical, medieval and renaissance Hermeticism, Neoplatonism, and later Theosophist and Rosicrucian thought the astral body is an intermediate body of light linking the rational soul to the physical body while the astral plane is an intermediate world of light between Heaven and Earth, composed of the spheres of the planets and stars. These astral spheres were held to be populated by angels, demons and spirits.Dodds, E.R. Proclus: The Elements of Theology. A revised text with translation, introduction, and commentary, 2nd edition 1963, Appendix. The subtle bodies, and their associated planes of existence, form an essential part of the esoteric systems that deal with astral phenomena. In the neo-platonism of Plotinus, for example, the individual is a microcosm (\\"small world\\") of the universe (the macrocosm or \\"great world\\"). \\"The rational soul...is akin to the great Soul of the World\\" while \\"the material universe, like the body, is made as a faded image of the Intelligible\\". Each succeeding plane of manifestation is causal to the next, a world-view known as emanationism; \\"from the One proceeds Intellect, from Intellect Soul, and from Soul - in its lower phase, or that of Nature - the material universe\\".John Gregory, The Neoplatonists, Kyle Cathie 1991 pp15‚Äì16 Often these bodies and their planes of existence are depicted as a series of concentric circles or nested spheres, with a separate body traversing each realm. The idea of the astral figured prominently in the work of the nineteenth-century French occultist Eliphas Levi, whence it was adopted and developed further by Theosophy, and used afterwards by other esoteric movements. =Biblical= Carrington, Muldoon, Peterson, and Williams claim that the subtle body is attached to the physical body by means of a psychic silver cord.Projection of the Astral Body by Carrington and MuldoonOut of Body Experiences: How to have them and what to expect by Robert Peterson (chapters 5, 17, 22) The final chapter of the Book of Ecclesiastes is often cited in this respect: \\"Before the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be broken, or the pitcher be shattered at the fountain, or the wheel be broken at the cistern.\\" Scherman, however, contends that the context points to this being merely a metaphor, comparing the body to a machine, with the silver cord referring to the spine. Paul's Second Epistle to the Corinthians is more generally agreed to refer to the astral planes: \\"I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know‚ÄîGod knows.\\" This statement gave rise to the Visio Pauli, a tract that offers a vision of heaven and hell, a forerunner of visions attributed to Adomnan and Tnugdalus as well as of Dante's Divine Comedy. =Ancient Egypt= The ba hovering above the body. This image is based on an original found in The Book of the Dead.Similar concepts of soul travel appear in various other religious traditions. For example, ancient Egyptian teachings present the soul (ba) as having the ability to hover outside the physical body via the ka, or subtle body. =China= Taoist alchemical practice involves creation of an energy body by breathing meditations, drawing energy into a 'pearl' that is then \\"circulated\\". \\"Xiangzi ... with a drum as his pillow fell fast asleep, snoring and motionless. His primordial spirit, however, went straight into the banquet room and said, \\"My lords, here I am again.\\" When Tuizhi walked with the officials to take a look, there really was a Taoist sleeping on the ground and snoring like thunder. Yet inside, in the side room, there was another Taoist beating a fisher drum and singing Taoist songs. The officials all said, \\"Although there are two different people, their faces and clothes are exactly alike. Clearly he is a divine immortal who can divide his body and appear in several places at once. ...\\" At that moment, the Taoist in the side room came walking out, and the Taoist sleeping on the ground woke up. The two merged into one.\\" =Hinduism= Similar ideas such as the Li·πÖga ≈öarƒ´ra are found in ancient Hindu scriptures such as, the YogaVashishta-Maharamayana of Valmiki. Modern Indians who have vouched for astral projection include Paramahansa Yogananda who witnessed Swami Pranabananda doing a miracle through a possible astral projection.Wikisource:Autobiography of a Yogi/Chapter 3 The Indian spiritual teacher Meher Baba described one's use of astral projection: > In the advancing stages leading to the beginning of the path, the aspirant > becomes spiritually prepared for being entrusted with free use of the forces > of the inner world of the astral bodies. He may then undertake astral > journeys in his astral body, leaving the physical body in sleep or > wakefulness.

This implies conscious use of the astral body. > Conscious separation of the astral body from the outer vehicle of the gross > body has its own value in making the soul feel its distinction from the > gross body and in arriving at fuller control of the gross body.

Astral projection is one of the Siddhis considered achievable by yoga practitioners through self-disciplined practice. In the epic The Mahabharata, Drona leaves his physical body to see if his son is alive. =Japan= The 'ikiry≈ç' as illustrated by Toriyama Sekien. In Japanese mythology, an (also read sh≈çry≈ç, seirei, or ikisudama) is a manifestation of the soul of a living person separately from their body. Traditionally, if someone holds a sufficient grudge against another person, it is believed that a part or the whole of their soul can temporarily leave their body and appear before the target of their hate in order to curse or otherwise harm them, similar to an evil eye. Souls are also believed to leave a living body when the body is extremely sick or comatose; such ikiry≈ç are not malevolent.Ramesh Chopra Academic Dictionary Of Mythology 2005, p. 144Patrick Drazen A Gathering of Spirits: Japan's Ghost Story Tradition: from Folklore and Kabuki to Anime and Manga 2011, p. 131 = Inuit Nunangat = In some Inuit groups, people with special capabilities are said to travel to (mythological) remote places, and report their experiences and things important to their fellows or the entire community; how to stop bad luck in hunting, cure a sick person etc.,Kleivan & Sonne 1985: 7‚Äì8, 12, 23‚Äì24,26, 27‚Äì29, 30, 31Merkur 1985: 4‚Äì6 things unavailable to people with normal capabilities.Hopp√°l 1975: 228 =Amazon= The yaskomo of the Waiwai is believed to be able to perform a \\"soul flight\\" that can serve several functions such as healing, flying to the sky to consult cosmological beings (the moon or the brother of the moon) to get a name for a new-born baby, flying to the cave of peccaries' mountains to ask the father of peccaries for abundance of game or flying deep down in a river to get the help of other beings.Fock 1963: 16 \\"Astral\\" and \\"etheric\\" The expression \\"astral projection\\" came to be used in two different ways.

Ralph Mannheim, Bollingen XCI, Princeton U.P., 1969 landscapes, but outside these circles the term was increasingly applied to non-physical travel around the physical world.e.g. William Judge, The Ocean of Theosophy 2nd Ed. TPH, 1893, Chapter 5, book online June 2008 at http://www.theosociety.org/pasadena/ocean/oce-hp.htm Though this usage continues to be widespread, the term, \\"etheric travel\\", used by some later Theosophists, offers a useful distinction. Some experients say they visit different times and/or places:Astral-Projections.com\\"Secret Guide To Instant Astral Projection \\" \\"etheric\\", then, is used to represent the sense of being \\"out of the body\\" in the physical world, whereas \\"astral\\" may connote some alteration in time-perception. Robert Monroe describes the former type of projection as \\"Locale I\\" or the \\"Here-Now\\", involving people and places that actually exist: Robert Bruce calls it the \\"Real Time Zone\\" (RTZ) and describes it as the non-physical dimension-level closest to the physical.Astral Dynamics by Robert Bruce Hampton Roads Publishing Company, Inc, 1999. p 25-27, 30-31 This etheric body is usually, though not always, invisible but is often perceived by the experient as connected to the physical body during separation by a \\"silver cord\\". Some link \\"falling\\" dreams with projection.Astral Dynamics by Robert Bruce. Hampton Roads Publishing Company, Inc, 1999 According to Max Heindel, the etheric \\"double\\" serves as a medium between the astral and physical realms. In his system the ether, also called prana, is the \\"vital force\\" that empowers the physical forms to change. From his descriptions it can be inferred that, to him, when one views the physical during an out-of- body experience, one is not technically \\"in\\" the astral realm at all.Heindel, Max, The Rosicrucian Mysteries (Chapter IV, The Constitution of Man: Vital Body - Desire Body - Mind), 1911, Other experiments may describe a domain that has no parallel to any known physical setting. Environments may be populated or unpopulated, artificial, natural or abstract, and the experience may be beatific, horrific or neutral. A common Theosophical belief is that one may access a compendium of mystical knowledge called the Akashic records. In many accounts the experiencer correlates the astral world with the world of dreams. Some even report seeing other dreamers enacting dream scenarios unaware of their wider environment. The astral environment may also be divided into levels or sub-planes by theorists, but there are many different views in various traditions concerning the overall structure of the astral planes: they may include heavens and hells and other after-death spheres, transcendent environments, or other less-easily characterized states.Journeys Out of the Body by Robert A. Monroe, p 60. Anchor Press, 1977.Monroe, Robert. Far Journeys.  Notable practitioners  Carrington and Muldoon, 1929 Emanuel Swedenborg was one of the first practitioners to write extensively about the out-of-body experience, in his Spiritual Diary (1747‚Äì65). French philosopher and novelist Honor√© de Balzac's fictional work \\"Louis Lambert\\" suggests he may have had some astral or out-of-body experiences.Frederick Lawton Balzac The Echo Library, 2007, p. 18 There are many twentieth-century publications on astral projection, although only a few authors remain widely cited. These include Robert Monroe, Oliver Fox, Sylvan Muldoon, and Hereward Carrington, and Yram. Robert Monroe's accounts of journeys to other realms (1971‚Äì1994) popularized the term \\"OBE\\" and were translated into a large number of languages. Though his books themselves only placed secondary importance on descriptions of method, Monroe also founded an institute dedicated to research, exploration and non-profit dissemination of auditory technology for assisting others in achieving projection and related altered states of consciousness. Robert Bruce, William Buhlman, Marilynn Hughes, and Albert Taylor have discussed their theories and findings on the syndicated show Coast to Coast AM several times. Michael Crichton gives lengthy and detailed explanations and experience of astral projection in his non-fiction book Travels. In her book, My Religion, Helen Keller tells of her beliefs in Swedenborgianism and how she once \\"traveled\\" to Athens: The soul's ability to leave the body at will or while sleeping and visit the various planes of heaven is also known as \\"soul travel\\". The practice is taught in Surat Shabd Yoga, where the experience is achieved mostly by meditation techniques and mantra repetition. All Sant Mat Gurus widely spoke about this kind of out of body experience, such as Kirpal Singh.See chapter V of the book Crown of Life by Kirpal Singh available online at Eckankar describes Soul Travel broadly as movement of the true, spiritual self (Soul) closer to the heart of God. While the contemplative may perceive the experience as travel, Soul itself is said not to move but to \\"come into an agreement with fixed states and conditions that already exist in some world of time and space\\". American Harold Klemp, the current Spiritual Leader of Eckankar practices and teaches Soul Travel, as did his predecessors, through contemplative techniques known as the Spiritual Exercises of ECK (Divine Spirit). Edgar Cayce from the US, was popularly known as the ‚ÄúSleeping Prophet‚Äù. He had been practicing astral travel at Washington DC for many years. In occult traditions, practices range from inducing trance states to the mental construction of a second body, called the Body of Light in Aleister Crowley's writings, through visualization and controlled breathing, followed by the transfer of consciousness to the secondary body by a mental act of will. Scientific reception There is no known scientific evidence that astral projection as an objective phenomenon exists. There are cases of patients having experiences suggestive of astral projection from brain stimulation treatments and hallucinogenic drugs, such as ketamine, phencyclidine, and DMT. Robert Todd Carroll writes that the main evidence to support claims of astral travel is anecdotal and comes \\"in the form of testimonials of those who claim to have experienced being out of their bodies when they may have been out of their minds.\\" Subjects in parapsychological experiments have attempted to project their astral bodies to distant rooms and see what was happening. However, such experiments haven't produced clear results. According to Bob Bruce of the Queensland Skeptics Association, astral projection is \\"just imagining\\", or \\"a dream state\\". Bruce writes that the existence of an astral plane is contrary to the limits of science. \\"We know how many possibilities there are for dimensions and we know what the dimensions do. None of it correlates with things like astral projection.\\" Bruce attributes astral experiences such as \\"meetings\\" alleged by practitioners to confirmation bias and coincidences. Psychologist Donovan Rawcliffe has written that astral projection can be explained by delusion, hallucination and vivid dreams.Rawcliffe, Donovan. (1988). Occult and Supernatural phenomena. Dover Publications. p. 123 Arthur W. Wiggins, writing in Quantum Leaps in the Wrong Direction: Where Real Science Ends...and Pseudoscience Begins, said that purported evidence of the ability to astral travel great distances and give descriptions of places visited is predominantly anecdotal. In 1978, Ingo Swann provided a test of his alleged ability to astral travel to Jupiter and observe details of the planet. Actual findings and information were later compared to Swann's claimed observations; according to an evaluation by James Randi, Swann's accuracy was \\"unconvincing and unimpressive\\" with an overall score of 37 percent. Wiggins considers astral travel an illusion, and looks to neuroanatomy, human belief, imagination and prior knowledge to provide prosaic explanations for those claiming to experience it.

His research on seat allocation methods (published in 1910) led to one being named after him, the Sainte-Lagu√´ method. Also named after him is the Sainte-Lagu√´ Index for measuring the proportionality of an electoral outcome. He is also notable for his informal calculation that supposedly demonstrated that a bumblebee could not fly, referred to in the introduction of 'Le Vol des Insectes' (Hermann and Cle, Paris, 1934) by the entomologist Antoine Magnan. This casual calculation was based on a comparison between an aeroplane and a bee, making the wrong assumption that bees' wings were smooth and flat. He, and others, soon corrected this assumption, but the story of the scientist who demonstrated that bee flight was impossible persists to this day.Known math: Bees He published several popular math texts, including \\"From the known to the unknown\\" (foreword by biologist Jean Rostand) which has been translated into several languages. Biography Born in Casteljaloux (Lot-et-Garonne) in 1882, Sainte-Lague was admitted at once, at the age of 20 years at the Ecole Polytechnique and Ecole Normale Superieure. He chose the latter and became a professor in the provinces, then in Paris. During World War I, having been wounded three times, he was attached to the Department of Inventions of the Normal School from 1917 to 1919, studied long-range artillery shells, and thereafter, the flight of birds and matters relating to aviation (theory test fish). After the First World War, as a professor in the schools of Paris, he became a lecturer in mathematics at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers. Then he received in 1938, the Chair of Applied Mathematics. He trained generations of engineers and technicians. He was the organizer and host of the Mathematics Section of the Palace of Discovery, where his encyclopedic mind is still present. Besides his academic career, he led a life of an activist, especially the Confederation of Intellectual Workers, of which he was president in 1929. From the earliest days of the occupation, he took an important part in the resistance and was even imprisoned for a while. He resumed his duties at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Metiers after the Liberation and had a growing number of students.

In the mathematical field of differential geometry, the Ricci flow (, ), sometimes also referred to as Hamilton's Ricci flow, is a certain partial differential equation for a Riemannian metric. It is often said to be analogous to the diffusion of heat and the heat equation, due to formal similarities in the mathematical structure of the equation; however, it exhibits many phenomena not present in the study of the heat equation. Many results for Ricci flow have also been shown for the mean curvature flow of hypersurfaces. The Ricci flow, so named for the presence of the Ricci tensor in its definition, was introduced by Richard S. Hamilton, who used it to prove a three-dimensional sphere theorem (). Following Shing-Tung Yau's suggestion that the singularities of solutions of the Ricci flow could identify the topological data predicted by William Thurston's geometrization conjecture, Hamilton produced a number of results in the 1990s which were directed towards its resolution. In 2002 and 2003, Grigori Perelman presented a number of new results about the Ricci flow, including a novel variant of some technical aspects of Hamilton's method (, ). He was awarded a Fields medal in 2006 for his contributions to the Ricci flow, which he declined to accept. Hamilton and Perelman's works are now widely regarded as forming a proof of the Thurston conjecture, including as a special case the Poincar√© conjecture, which had been a well-known open problem in the field of geometric topology since 1904. However, many of Perelman's methods rely on a number of highly technical results from a number of disparate subfields within differential geometry, so that the full proof of the Thurston conjecture remains understood by only a very small number of mathematicians. The proof of the Poincar√© conjecture, for which there are shortcut arguments due to Perelman and to Tobias Colding and William Minicozzi, is much more widely understood (, ). It is regarded as one of the major successes of the mathematical field of geometric analysis. Simon Brendle and Richard Schoen later extended Hamilton's sphere theorem to higher dimensions, proving as a particular case the differentiable sphere conjecture from Riemannian geometry, which had been open for over fifty years ().  Mathematical definition  On a smooth manifold M, a smooth Riemannian metric g automatically determines the Ricci tensor Ricg. For each element p of M, gp is (by definition) a positive- definite inner product on TpM; if given a one-parameter family of Riemannian metrics gt, one may then consider the derivative gt, evaluated at a particular value of t, to assign to each p a symmetric bilinear form on TpM. Since the Ricci tensor of a Riemannian metric also assigns to each p a symmetric bilinear form on TpM, the following definition is meaningful. * Given a smooth manifold M and an open real interval (a,b), a \\"Ricci flow\\" assigns to each t‚àà(a,b) a Riemannian metric gt on M such that ::\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}g_t=-2\\\\operatorname{Ric}^{g_t}. The Ricci tensor is often thought of as an average value of the sectional curvatures, or as an algebraic trace of the Riemann curvature tensor. However, for the analysis of the Ricci flow, it is extremely significant that the Ricci tensor can be defined, in local coordinates, by an algebraic formula involving the first and second derivatives of the metric tensor. The specific character of this formula provides the foundation for the existence of Ricci flows; see the following section for the corresponding result. Let k be a nonzero number. Given a Ricci flow gt on an interval (a,b), consider Gt=gkt for t between and . Then :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}G_t=-2k\\\\operatorname{Ric}^{G_t}. So, with this very trivial change of parameters, the number ‚àí2 appearing in the definition of the Ricci flow could be replaced by any other nonzero number. For this reason, the use of ‚àí2 can be regarded as an arbitrary convention, albeit one which essentially every paper and exposition on Ricci flow follows. The only significant difference is that if ‚àí2 were replaced by a positive number, then the existence theorem discussed in the following section would become a theorem which produces a Ricci flow that moves backwards (rather than forwards) in parameter values from initial data. The parameter t is usually called \\"time,\\" although this is as part of standard terminology in the mathematical field of partial differential equations, rather than as physically meaningful terminology. In fact, in the standard quantum field theoretic interpretation of the Ricci flow in terms of the renormalization group, the parameter t corresponds to length or energy rather than time. =Normalized Ricci flow= Suppose that M is a compact smooth manifold, and let gt be a Ricci flow for t‚àà(a,b). Define Œ®:(a,b)‚Üí(0,‚àû) so that each of the Riemannian metrics Œ®(t)gt has volume 1; this is possible since M is compact. (More generally, it would be possible if each Riemannian metric gt had finite volume.) Then define F:(a,b)‚Üí(0,‚àû) by :F(t)=\\\\int_a^t\\\\Psi(\\\\sigma)\\\\,d\\\\sigma. Since Œ® is positive-valued, F is a bijection onto its image (0,S). Now the Riemannian metrics Gs=Œ®(F‚àí1(s))gF‚àí1(s), defined for parameters s‚àà(0,S), satisfy :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial s}G_s=-2\\\\operatorname{Ric}^{G_s} +\\\\frac{2}{n}\\\\frac{\\\\int_M R^{G_s}\\\\,d\\\\mu_{G_s}}{\\\\int_M d\\\\mu_{G_s}} G_s. This is called the \\"normalized Ricci flow\\" equation. Thus, with an explicitly defined change of scale Œ® and a reparametrization of the parameter values, a Ricci flow can be converted into a normalized Ricci flow. The reason for doing this is that the major convergence theorems for Ricci flow can be conveniently expressed in terms of the normalized Ricci flow. However, it is not essential to do so, and for virtually all purposes it suffices to consider Ricci flow in its standard form. Existence and uniqueness Let M be a smooth closed manifold, and let g0 be any smooth Riemannian metric on M. Making use of the Nash‚ÄìMoser implicit function theorem, showed the following existence theorem: * There exists a positive number T and a Ricci flow gt parametrized by t‚àà(0,T) such that gt converges to g0 in the C‚àû topology as t decreases to 0. He showed the following uniqueness theorem: * If \\\\\\\\{g_t:t\\\\in(0,T)\\\\\\\\} and \\\\\\\\{\\\\widetilde{g}_t:t\\\\in(0,\\\\widetilde{T})\\\\\\\\} are two Ricci flows as in the above existence theorem, then g_t=\\\\widetilde{g}_t for all t\\\\in(0,\\\\min\\\\\\\\{T,\\\\widetilde{T}\\\\\\\\}). The existence theorem provides a one- parameter family of smooth Riemannian metrics. In fact, any such one-parameter family also depends smoothly on the parameter. Precisely, this says that relative to any smooth coordinate chart (U,œÜ) on M, the function g_{ij}:U\\\\times(0,T)\\\\to\\\\mathbb{R} is smooth for any i,j=1,...,n. Dennis DeTurck subsequently gave a proof of the above results which uses the Banach implicit function theorem instead. His work is essentially a simpler Riemannian version of Yvonne Choquet-Bruhat's well-known proof and interpretation of well- posedness for the Einstein equations in Lorentzian geometry. As a consequence of Hamilton's existence and uniqueness theorem, when given the data (M,g0), one may speak unambiguously of the Ricci flow on M with initial data g0, and one may select T to take on its maximal possible value, which could be infinite. The principle behind virtually all major applications of Ricci flow, in particular in the proof of the Poincar√© conjecture and geometrization conjecture, is that, as t approaches this maximal value, the behavior of the metrics gt can reveal and reflect deep information about M. Convergence theorems Complete expositions of the following convergence theorems are given in and . The three-dimensional result is due to . Hamilton's proof, inspired by and loosely modeled upon James Eells and Joseph Sampson's epochal 1964 paper on convergence of the harmonic map heat flow, included many novel features, such as an extension of the maximum principle to the setting of symmetric 2-tensors. His paper (together with that of Eells‚àíSampson) is among the most widely cited in the field of differential geometry. There is an exposition of his result in . In terms of the proof, the two-dimensional case is properly viewed as a collection of three different results, one for each of the cases in which the Euler characteristic of is positive, zero, or negative. As demonstrated by , the negative case is handled by the maximum principle, while the zero case is handled by integral estimates; the positive case is more subtle, and Hamilton dealt with the subcase in which has positive curvature by combining a straightforward adaptation of Peter Li and Shing-Tung Yau's gradient estimate to the Ricci flow together with an innovative \\"entropy estimate\\". The full positive case was demonstrated by Bennett , in an extension of Hamilton's techniques. Since any Ricci flow on a two-dimensional manifold is confined to a single conformal class, it can be recast as a partial differential equation for a scalar function on the fixed Riemannian manifold . As such, the Ricci flow in this setting can also be studied by purely analytic methods; correspondingly, there are alternative non-geometric proofs of the two-dimensional convergence theorem. The higher-dimensional case has a longer history. Soon after Hamilton's breakthrough result, Gerhard Huisken extended his methods to higher dimensions, showing that if almost has constant positive curvature (in the sense of smallness of certain components of the Ricci decomposition), then the normalized Ricci flow converges smoothly to constant curvature. found a novel formulation of the maximum principle in terms of trapping by convex sets, which led to a general criterion relating convergence of the Ricci flow of positively curved metrics to the existence of \\"pinching sets\\" for a certain multidimensional ordinary differential equation. As a consequence, he was able to settle the case in which is four-dimensional and has positive curvature operator. Twenty years later, Christoph B√∂hm and Burkhard Wilking found a new algebraic method of constructing \\"pinching sets,\\" thereby removing the assumption of four-dimensionality from Hamilton's result (). Simon Brendle and Richard Schoen showed that positivity of the isotropic curvature is preserved by the Ricci flow on a closed manifold; by applying B√∂hm and Wilking's method, they were able to derive a new Ricci flow convergence theorem (). Their convergence theorem included as a special case the resolution of the differentiable sphere theorem, which at the time had been a long-standing conjecture. The convergence theorem given above is due to , which subsumes the earlier higher-dimensional convergence results of Huisken, Hamilton, B√∂hm & Wilking, and Brendle & Schoen. =Corollaries= The results in dimensions three and higher show that any smooth closed manifold which admits a metric of the given type must be a space form of positive curvature. Since these space forms are largely understood by work of √âlie Cartan and others, one may draw corollaries such as * Suppose that is a smooth closed 3-dimensional manifold which admits a smooth Riemannian metric of positive Ricci curvature. If is simply-connected then it must be diffeomorphic to the 3-sphere. So if one could show directly that any smooth closed simply- connected 3-dimensional manifold admits a smooth Riemannian metric of positive Ricci curvature, then the Poincar√© conjecture would immediately follow. However, as matters are understood at present, this result is only known as a (trivial) corollary of the Poincar√© conjecture, rather than vice versa. =Possible extensions= Given any larger than two, there exist many closed -dimensional smooth manifolds which do not have any smooth Riemannian metrics of constant curvature. So one cannot hope to be able to simply drop the curvature conditions from the above convergence theorems. It could be possible to replace the curvature conditions by some alternatives, but the existence of compact manifolds such as complex projective space, which has a metric of nonnegative curvature operator (the Fubini-Study metric) but no metric of constant curvature, makes it unclear how much these conditions could be pushed. Likewise, the possibility of formulating analogous convergence results for negatively curved Riemannian metrics is complicated by the existence of closed Riemannian manifolds whose curvature is arbitrarily close to constant and yet admit no metrics of constant curvature. Li‚ÄìYau inequalities Making use of a technique pioneered by Peter Li and Shing-Tung Yau for parabolic differential equations on Riemannian manifolds, proved the following \\"Li‚ÄìYau inequality.\\" * Let M be a smooth manifold, and let gt be a solution of the Ricci flow with t‚àà(0,T) such that each gt is complete with bounded curvature. Furthermore, suppose that each gt has nonnegative curvature operator. Then, for any curve Œ≥:[t1,t2]‚ÜíM with [t1,t2]‚äÇ(0,T), one has ::\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\big(R^{g(t)}(\\\\gamma(t))\\\\big)+\\\\frac{R^{g(t)}(\\\\gamma(t))}{t}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\operatorname{Ric}^{g(t)}(\\\\gamma'(t),\\\\gamma'(t))\\\\geq 0. showed the following alternative Li‚ÄìYau inequality. * Let M be a smooth closed n-manifold, and let gt be a solution of the Ricci flow. Consider the backwards heat equation for n-forms, i.e. œâ+Œîg(t)œâ=0; given p‚ààM and t0‚àà(0,T), consider the particular solution which, upon integration, converges weakly to the Dirac delta measure as t increases to t0. Then, for any curve Œ≥:[t1,t2]‚ÜíM with [t1,t2]‚äÇ(0,T), one has ::\\\\frac{d}{dt}\\\\big(f(\\\\gamma(t),t)\\\\big)+\\\\frac{f\\\\big(\\\\gamma(t),t\\\\big)}{2(t_0-t)}\\\\leq\\\\frac{R^{g(t)}(\\\\gamma(t))+\\\\gamma'(t)_{g(t)}^2}{2}. :where œâ=(4œÄ(t0-t))-n/2e‚àíf dŒºg(t). Both of these remarkable inequalities are of profound importance for the proof of the Poincar√© conjecture and geometrization conjecture. The terms on the right hand side of Perelman's Li- Yau inequality motivates the definition of his \\"reduced length\\" functional, the analysis of which leads to his \\"noncollapsing theorem.\\" The noncollapsing theorem allows application of Hamilton's compactness theorem (Hamilton 1995) to construct \\"singularity models,\\" which are Ricci flows on new three- dimensional manifolds. Owing to the Hamilton‚ÄìIvey estimate, these new Ricci flows have nonnegative curvature. Hamilton's Li‚ÄìYau inequality can then be applied to see that the scalar curvature is, at each point, a nondecreasing (nonnegative) function of time. This is a powerful result that allows many further arguments to go through. In the end, Perelman shows that any of his singularity models is asymptotically like a complete gradient shrinking Ricci soliton, which are completely classified; see the previous section. See for details on Hamilton's Li‚ÄìYau inequality; the books and contain expositions of both inequalities above. Examples =Constant-curvature and Einstein metrics= Let (M,g) be a Riemannian manifold which is Einstein, meaning that there is a number Œª such that Ricg=Œªg. Then gt=(1-2Œªt)g is a Ricci flow with g0=g, since then :\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}g_t=-2\\\\lambda g=-2\\\\operatorname{Ric}^g=-2\\\\operatorname{Ric}^{g_t}. If M is closed, then according to Hamilton's uniqueness theorem above, this is the only Ricci flow with initial data g. One sees, in particular, that: * if Œª is positive, then the Ricci flow \\"contracts\\" g since the scale factor 1-2Œªt is less than 1 for positive t; furthermore, one sees that t can only be less than 1/2Œª, in order that gt is a Riemannian metric. This is the simplest examples of a \\"finite- time singularity.\\" * if Œª is zero, which is synonymous with g being Ricci- flat, then gt is independent of time, and so the maximal interval of existence is the entire real line. * if Œª is negative, then the Ricci flow \\"expands\\" g since the scale factor 1-2Œªt is greater than 1 for all positive t; furthermore one sees that t can be taken arbitrarily large. One says that the Ricci flow, for this initial metric, is \\"immortal.\\" In each case, since the Riemannian metrics assigned to different values of t differ only by a constant scale factor, one can see that the normalized Ricci flow Gs exists for all time and is constant in s; in particular, it converges smoothly (to its constant value) as s‚Üí‚àû. The Einstein condition has as a special case that of constant curvature; hence the particular examples of the sphere (with its standard metric) and hyperbolic space appear as special cases of the above. =Ricci solitons= Ricci solitons are Ricci flows that may change their size but not their shape up to diffeomorphisms. * Cylinders Sk √ó Rl (for k ‚â• 2) shrink self similarly under the Ricci flow up to diffeomorphisms *A significant 2-dimensional example is the cigar soliton, which is given by the metric (dx2 + dy2)/(e4t + x2 + y2) on the Euclidean plane. Although this metric shrinks under the Ricci flow, its geometry remains the same. Such solutions are called steady Ricci solitons. * An example of a 3-dimensional steady Ricci soliton is the Bryant soliton, which is rotationally symmetric, has positive curvature, and is obtained by solving a system of ordinary differential equations. A similar construction works in arbitrary dimension. * There exist numerous families of K√§hler manifolds, invariant under a U(n) action and birational to Cn, which are Ricci solitons. These examples were constructed by Cao and Feldman-Ilmanen-Knopf. (Chow-Knopf 2004) A gradient shrinking Ricci soliton consists of a smooth Riemannian manifold (M,g) and f‚ààC‚àû(M) such that :\\\\operatorname{Ric}^g+\\\\operatorname{Hess}^gf=\\\\frac{1}{2}g. One of the major achievements of was to show that, if M is a closed three-dimensional smooth manifold, then finite-time singularities of the Ricci flow on M are modeled on complete gradient shrinking Ricci solitons (possibly on underlying manifolds distinct from M). In 2008, Huai-Dong Cao, Bing-Long Chen, and Xi-Ping Zhu completed the classification of these solitons, showing: * Suppose (M,g,f) is a complete gradient shrinking Ricci soliton with dim(M)=3. If M is simply- connected then the Riemannian manifold (M,g) is isometric to \\\\mathbb{R}^3, S^3, or S^2\\\\times\\\\mathbb{R}, each with their standard Riemannian metrics. This was originally shown by with some extra conditional assumptions. Note that if M is not simply-connected, then one may consider the universal cover \\\\pi:M'\\\\to M, and then the above theorem applies to (M',\\\\pi^\\\\ast g,f\\\\circ\\\\pi). There is not yet a good understanding of gradient shrinking Ricci solitons in any higher dimensions.  Relationship to uniformization and geometrization  The Ricci flow was utilized by Richard S. Hamilton (1981) to gain insight into the geometrization conjecture of William Thurston, which concerns the topological classification of three-dimensional smooth manifolds.. A popular book that explains the background for the Thurston classification program. Hamilton's idea was to define a kind of nonlinear diffusion equation which would tend to smooth out irregularities in the metric. Then, by placing an arbitrary metric g on a given smooth manifold M and evolving the metric by the Ricci flow, the metric should approach a particularly nice metric, which might constitute a canonical form for M. Suitable canonical forms had already been identified by Thurston; the possibilities, called Thurston model geometries, include the three-sphere S3, three-dimensional Euclidean space E3, three-dimensional hyperbolic space H3, which are homogeneous and isotropic, and five slightly more exotic Riemannian manifolds, which are homogeneous but not isotropic. (This list is closely related to, but not identical with, the Bianchi classification of the three-dimensional real Lie algebras into nine classes.) Hamilton's idea was that these special metrics should behave like fixed points of the Ricci flow, and that if, for a given manifold, globally only one Thurston geometry was admissible, this might even act like an attractor under the flow. Hamilton succeeded in proving that any smooth closed three-manifold which admits a metric of positive Ricci curvature also admits a unique Thurston geometry, namely a spherical metric, which does indeed act like an attracting fixed point under the Ricci flow, renormalized to preserve volume. (Under the unrenormalized Ricci flow, the manifold collapses to a point in finite time.) This doesn't prove the full geometrization conjecture, because the most difficult case turns out to concern manifolds with negative Ricci curvature and more specifically those with negative sectional curvature. Indeed, a triumph of nineteenth-century geometry was the proof of the uniformization theorem, the analogous topological classification of smooth two-manifolds, where Hamilton showed that the Ricci flow does indeed evolve a negatively curved two-manifold into a two-dimensional multi-holed torus which is locally isometric to the hyperbolic plane. This topic is closely related to important topics in analysis, number theory, dynamical systems, mathematical physics, and even cosmology. Note that the term \\"uniformization\\" suggests a kind of smoothing away of irregularities in the geometry, while the term \\"geometrization\\" suggests placing a geometry on a smooth manifold. Geometry is being used here in a precise manner akin to Klein's notion of geometry (see Geometrization conjecture for further details). In particular, the result of geometrization may be a geometry that is not isotropic. In most cases including the cases of constant curvature, the geometry is unique. An important theme in this area is the interplay between real and complex formulations. In particular, many discussions of uniformization speak of complex curves rather than real two-manifolds. The Ricci flow does not preserve volume, so to be more careful, in applying the Ricci flow to uniformization and geometrization one needs to normalize the Ricci flow to obtain a flow which preserves volume. If one fails to do this, the problem is that (for example) instead of evolving a given three-dimensional manifold into one of Thurston's canonical forms, we might just shrink its size. It is possible to construct a kind of moduli space of n-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, and then the Ricci flow really does give a geometric flow (in the intuitive sense of particles flowing along flowlines) in this moduli space. Singularities Hamilton showed that a compact Riemannian manifold always admits a short-time Ricci flow solution. Later Shi generalized the short-time existence result to complete manifolds of bounded curvature. In general, however, due to the highly non-linear nature of the Ricci flow equation, singularities form in finite time. These singularities are curvature singularities, which means that as one approaches the singular time the norm of the curvature tensor \\\\operatorname{Rm} blows up to infinity in the region of the singularity. A fundamental problem in Ricci flow is to understand all the possible geometries of singularities. When successful, this can lead to insights into the topology of manifolds. For instance, analyzing the geometry of singular regions that may develop in 3d Ricci flow, is the crucial ingredient in Perelman's proof the Poincare and Geometrization Conjectures. =Blow-up limits of singularities= To study the formation of singularities it is useful, as in the study of other non-linear differential equations, to consider blow-ups limits. Intuitively speaking, one zooms into the singular region of the Ricci flow by rescaling time and space. Under certain assumptions, the zoomed in flow tends to a limiting Ricci flow (M_\\\\infty, g_\\\\infty(t)), t \\\\in (-\\\\infty, 0] , called a singularity model. Singularity models are ancient Ricci flows, i.e. they can be extended infinitely into the past. Understanding the possible singularity models in Ricci flow is an active research endeavor. Below, we sketch the blow-up procedure in more detail: Let (M, g_t), \\\\, t \\\\in [0,T), be a Ricci flow that develops a singularity as t \\\\rightarrow T. Let (p_i, t_i) \\\\in M \\\\times [0,T) be a sequence of points in spacetime such that :K_i := \\\\operatorname{Rm}(g_{t_i})(p_i) \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty as i \\\\rightarrow \\\\infty. Then one considers the parabolically rescaled metrics :g_i(t) = K_i g\\\\left(t_i + \\\\frac{t}{K_i}\\\\right), \\\\quad t\\\\in[-K_i t_i, 0] Due to the symmetry of the Ricci flow equation under parabolic dilations, the metrics g_i(t) are also solutions to the Ricci flow equation. In the case that : Rm \\\\leq K_i \\\\text{ on } M \\\\times [0,t_i], i.e. up to time t_i the maximum of the curvature is attained at p_i, then the pointed sequence of Ricci flows (M, g_i(t), p_i) subsequentially converges smoothly to a limiting ancient Ricci flow (M_{\\\\infty}, g_{\\\\infty}(t), p_{\\\\infty}). Note that in general M_\\\\infty is not diffeomorphic to M. =Type I and Type II singularities= Hamilton distinguishes between Type I and Type II singularities in Ricci flow. In particular, one says a Ricci flow (M, g_t), \\\\, t \\\\in [0,T) , encountering a singularity a time T is of Type I if : \\\\sup_{t < T} (T-t)Rm < \\\\infty . Otherwise the singularity is of Type II. It is known that the blow-up limits of Type I singularities are gradient shrinking Ricci solitons. In the Type II case it is an open question whether the singularity model must be a steady Ricci soliton‚Äîso far all known examples are. =Singularities in 3d Ricci flow= In 3d the possible blow-up limits of Ricci flow singularities are well-understood. By Hamilton, Perelman and recent work by Brendle, blowing up at points of maximum curvature leads to one of the following three singularity models: * The shrinking round spherical space form S^3/\\\\Gamma * The shrinking round cylinder S^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R} * The Bryant soliton The first two singularity models arise from Type I singularities, whereas the last one arises from a Type II singularity. =Singularities in 4d Ricci flow= In four dimensions very little is known about the possible singularities, other than that the possibilities are far more numerous than in three dimensions. To date the following singularity models are known *S^3 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R} *S^2 \\\\times \\\\mathbb{R}^2 *The 4d Bryant soliton *Compact Einstein manifold of positive scalar curvature *Compact gradient Kahler-Ricci shrinking soliton *The FIK shrinker *The Eguchi‚ÄìHanson space Note that the first three examples are generalizations of 3d singularity models. The FIK shrinker models the collapse of an embedded sphere with self-intersection number -1.  Relation to diffusion  To see why the evolution equation defining the Ricci flow is indeed a kind of nonlinear diffusion equation, we can consider the special case of (real) two- manifolds in more detail. Any metric tensor on a two-manifold can be written with respect to an exponential isothermal coordinate chart in the form : ds^2 = \\\\exp(2 \\\\, p(x,y)) \\\\, \\\\left( dx^2 + dy^2 \\\\right). (These coordinates provide an example of a conformal coordinate chart, because angles, but not distances, are correctly represented.) The easiest way to compute the Ricci tensor and Laplace-Beltrami operator for our Riemannian two-manifold is to use the differential forms method of √âlie Cartan. Take the coframe field : \\\\sigma^1 = \\\\exp (p) \\\\, dx, \\\\; \\\\; \\\\sigma^2 = \\\\exp (p) \\\\, dy so that metric tensor becomes : \\\\sigma^1 \\\\otimes \\\\sigma^1 + \\\\sigma^2 \\\\otimes \\\\sigma^2 = \\\\exp(2 p) \\\\, \\\\left( dx \\\\otimes dx + dy \\\\otimes dy \\\\right). Next, given an arbitrary smooth function h(x,y), compute the exterior derivative : d h = h_x dx + h_y dy = \\\\exp(-p) h_x \\\\, \\\\sigma^1 + \\\\exp(-p) h_y \\\\, \\\\sigma^2. Take the Hodge dual : \\\\star d h = -\\\\exp(-p) h_y \\\\, \\\\sigma^1 + \\\\exp(-p) h_x \\\\, \\\\sigma^2 = -h_y \\\\, dx + h_x \\\\, dy. Take another exterior derivative : d \\\\star d h = -h_{yy} \\\\, dy \\\\wedge dx + h_{xx} \\\\, dx \\\\wedge dy = \\\\left( h_{xx} + h_{yy} \\\\right) \\\\, dx \\\\wedge dy (where we used the anti-commutative property of the exterior product). That is, : d \\\\star d h = \\\\exp(-2 p) \\\\, \\\\left( h_{xx} + h_{yy} \\\\right) \\\\, \\\\sigma^1 \\\\wedge \\\\sigma^2. Taking another Hodge dual gives : \\\\Delta h = \\\\star d \\\\star d h = \\\\exp(-2 p) \\\\, \\\\left( h_{xx} + h_{yy} \\\\right) which gives the desired expression for the Laplace/Beltrami operator : \\\\Delta = \\\\exp(-2 \\\\, p(x,y)) \\\\left( D_x^2 + D_y^2 \\\\right). To compute the curvature tensor, we take the exterior derivative of the covector fields making up our coframe: : d \\\\sigma^1 = p_y \\\\exp(p) dy \\\\wedge dx = -\\\\left( p_y dx \\\\right) \\\\wedge \\\\sigma^2 = -{\\\\omega^1}_2 \\\\wedge \\\\sigma^2 : d \\\\sigma^2 = p_x \\\\exp(p) dx \\\\wedge dy = -\\\\left( p_x dy \\\\right) \\\\wedge \\\\sigma^1 = -{\\\\omega^2}_1 \\\\wedge \\\\sigma^1. From these expressions, we can read off the only independent Spin connection one-form : {\\\\omega^1}_2 = p_y dx - p_x dy, where we have taken advantage of the anti-symmetric property of the connection ({\\\\omega^2}_1=-{\\\\omega^1}_2). Take another exterior derivative : d {\\\\omega^1}_2 = p_{yy} dy \\\\wedge dx - p_{xx} dx \\\\wedge dy = -\\\\left( p_{xx} + p_{yy} \\\\right) \\\\, dx \\\\wedge dy. This gives the curvature two-form : {\\\\Omega^1}_2 = -\\\\exp(-2p) \\\\left( p_{xx} + p_{yy} \\\\right) \\\\, \\\\sigma^1 \\\\wedge \\\\sigma^2 = -\\\\Delta p \\\\, \\\\sigma^1 \\\\wedge \\\\sigma^2 from which we can read off the only linearly independent component of the Riemann tensor using : {\\\\Omega^1}_2 = {R^1}_{212} \\\\, \\\\sigma^1 \\\\wedge \\\\sigma^2. Namely : {R^1}_{212} = -\\\\Delta p from which the only nonzero components of the Ricci tensor are : R_{22} = R_{11} = -\\\\Delta p. From this, we find components with respect to the coordinate cobasis, namely : R_{xx} = R_{yy} = -\\\\left( p_{xx} + p_{yy} \\\\right). But the metric tensor is also diagonal, with : g_{xx} = g_{yy} = \\\\exp (2 p) and after some elementary manipulation, we obtain an elegant expression for the Ricci flow: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial p}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\Delta p. This is manifestly analogous to the best known of all diffusion equations, the heat equation : \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\Delta u where now \\\\Delta = D_x^2 + D_y^2 is the usual Laplacian on the Euclidean plane. The reader may object that the heat equation is of course a linear partial differential equation‚Äîwhere is the promised nonlinearity in the p.d.e. defining the Ricci flow? The answer is that nonlinearity enters because the Laplace-Beltrami operator depends upon the same function p which we used to define the metric. But notice that the flat Euclidean plane is given by taking p(x,y) = 0. So if p is small in magnitude, we can consider it to define small deviations from the geometry of a flat plane, and if we retain only first order terms in computing the exponential, the Ricci flow on our two-dimensional almost flat Riemannian manifold becomes the usual two dimensional heat equation. This computation suggests that, just as (according to the heat equation) an irregular temperature distribution in a hot plate tends to become more homogeneous over time, so too (according to the Ricci flow) an almost flat Riemannian manifold will tend to flatten out the same way that heat can be carried off \\"to infinity\\" in an infinite flat plate. But if our hot plate is finite in size, and has no boundary where heat can be carried off, we can expect to homogenize the temperature, but clearly we cannot expect to reduce it to zero. In the same way, we expect that the Ricci flow, applied to a distorted round sphere, will tend to round out the geometry over time, but not to turn it into a flat Euclidean geometry. Recent developments The Ricci flow has been intensively studied since 1981. Some recent work has focused on the question of precisely how higher-dimensional Riemannian manifolds evolve under the Ricci flow, and in particular, what types of parametric singularities may form. For instance, a certain class of solutions to the Ricci flow demonstrates that neckpinch singularities will form on an evolving n-dimensional metric Riemannian manifold having a certain topological property (positive Euler characteristic), as the flow approaches some characteristic time t_{0}. In certain cases, such neckpinches will produce manifolds called Ricci solitons. For a 3-dimensional manifold, Perelman showed how to continue past the singularities using surgery on the manifold. K√§hler metrics remain K√§hler under Ricci flow, and so Ricci flow has also been studied in this setting, where it is called \\"K√§hler-Ricci flow.\\"  See also  =Applications= * Uniformization theorem * Geometrization conjecture * Solution of the Poincar√© conjecture * Differentiable sphere theorem =General context= * Ricci curvature * Calculus of variations * Geometric flow  Notes   References  Articles for a popular mathematical audience.  * Research articles.  * Erratum. ** Revised version:      Textbooks     * * External links * Category:Geometric flow Category:Partial differential equations Category:3-manifolds Category:1981 introductions ","title":"Ricci flow"},{"id":"288292","text":"Neuropsychology is a branch of psychology that is concerned with how the brain and the rest of the nervous system influence a person's cognition and behaviors. More importantly, professionals in this branch of psychology often focus on how injuries or illnesses of the brain affect cognitive functions and behaviors. It is both an experimental and clinical field of psychology that aims to understand how behavior and cognition are influenced by brain functioning and is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of behavioral and cognitive effects of neurological disorders. Whereas classical neurology focuses on the pathology of the nervous system and classical psychology is largely divorced from it, neuropsychology seeks to discover how the brain correlates with the mind through the study of neurological patients. It thus shares concepts and concerns with neuropsychiatry and with behavioral neurology in general. The term neuropsychology has been applied to lesion studies in humans and animals. It has also been applied in efforts to record electrical activity from individual cells (or groups of cells) in higher primates (including some studies of human patients). In practice, neuropsychologists tend to work in research settings (universities, laboratories or research institutions), clinical settings (medical hospitals or rehabilitation settings, often involved in assessing or treating patients with neuropsychological problems), or forensic settings or industry (often as clinical-trial consultants where CNS function is a concern).  History  Neuropsychology is a relatively new discipline within the field of psychology. The first textbook defining the field, Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology, was initially published by Kolb and Whishaw in 1980. However, the history of its development can be traced back to the Third Dynasty in ancient Egypt, perhaps even earlier. There is much debate as to when societies started considering the functions of different organs. For many centuries, the brain was thought useless and was often discarded during burial processes and autopsies. As the field of medicine developed its understanding of human anatomy and physiology, different theories were developed as to why the body functioned the way it did. Many times, bodily functions were approached from a religious point of view and abnormalities were blamed on bad spirits and the gods. The brain has not always been considered the center of the functioning body. It has taken hundreds of years to develop our understanding of the brain and how it affects our behaviors. = Ancient Egypt = In ancient Egypt, writings on medicine date from the time of the priest Imhotep. They took a more scientific approach to medicine and disease, describing the brain, trauma, abnormalities, and remedies for reference for future physicians. Despite this, Egyptians saw the heart, not the brain, as the seat of the soul. = Aristotle = Senses, perception, memory, dreams, action in Aristotle's biology. Impressions are stored in the seat of perception, linked by his Laws of Association (similarity, contrast, and contiguity).Aristotle reinforced this focus on the heart which originated in Egypt. He believed the heart to be in control of mental processes, and looked on the brain, due to its inert nature, as a mechanism for cooling the heat generated by the heart. He drew his conclusions based on the empirical study of animals. He found that while their brains were cold to the touch and that such contact did not trigger any movements, the heart was warm and active, accelerating and slowing dependent on mood. Such beliefs were upheld by many for years to come, persisting through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance period until they began to falter in the 17th century due to further research. The influence of Aristotle in the development of neuropsychology is evident within language used in modern day, since we \\"follow our hearts\\" and \\"learn by the heart.\\" = Hippocrates = Hippocrates viewed the brain as the seat of the soul. He drew a connection between the brain and behaviors of the body, writing: \\"The brain exercises the greatest power in the man.\\" Apart from moving the focus from the heart as the \\"seat of the soul\\" to the brain, Hippocrates did not go into much detail about its actual functioning. However, by switching the attention of the medical community to the brain, his theory led to more scientific discovery of the organ responsible for our behaviors. For years to come, scientists were inspired to explore the functions of the body and to find concrete explanations for both normal and abnormal behaviors. Scientific discovery led them to believe that there were natural and organically occurring reasons to explain various functions of the body, and it could all be traced back to the brain. Hippocrates introduced the concept of the mind ‚Äì which was widely seen as a separate function apart from the actual brain organ. = Ren√© Descartes = Philosopher Ren√© Descartes expanded upon this idea and is most widely known for his work on the mind-body problem. Often Descartes's ideas were looked upon as overly philosophical and lacking in sufficient scientific foundation. Descartes focused much of his anatomical experimentation on the brain, paying special attention to the pineal gland ‚Äì which he argued was the actual \\"seat of the soul.\\" Still deeply rooted in a spiritual outlook towards the scientific world, the body was said to be mortal, and the soul immortal. The pineal gland was then thought to be the very place at which the mind would interact with the mortal and machine-like body. At the time, Descartes was convinced the mind had control over the behaviors of the body (controlling the person) ‚Äì but also that the body could have influence over the mind, which is referred to as dualism. This idea that the mind essentially had control over the body, but the body could resist or even influence other behaviors, was a major turning point in the way many physiologists would look at the brain. The capabilities of the mind were observed to do much more than simply react, but also to be rational and function in organized, thoughtful ways ‚Äì much more complex than he thought the animal world to be. These ideas, although disregarded by many and cast aside for years led the medical community to expand their own ideas of the brain and begin to understand in new ways just how intricate the workings of the brain really were, and the complete effects it had on daily life, as well as which treatments would be the most beneficial to helping those people living with a dysfunctional mind. The mind-body problem, spurred by Ren√© Descartes, continues to this day with many philosophical arguments both for and against his ideas. However controversial they were and remain today, the fresh and well-thought-out perspective Descartes presented has had long-lasting effects on the various disciplines of medicine, psychology and much more, especially in putting an emphasis on separating the mind from the body in order to explain observable behaviors. = Thomas Willis = Thomas Willis It was in the mid-17th century that another major contributor to the field of neuropsychology emerged. Thomas Willis studied at Oxford University and took a physiological approach to the brain and behavior. It was Willis who coined the words 'hemisphere' and 'lobe' when referring to the brain. He was one of the earliest to use the words 'neurology' and 'psychology'. Rejecting the idea that humans were the only beings capable of rational thought, Willis looked at specialized structures of the brain. He theorized that higher structures accounted for complex functions, whereas lower structures were responsible for functions similar to those seen in other animals, consisting mostly of reactions and automatic responses. He was particularly interested in people who suffered from manic disorders and hysteria. His research constituted some of the first times that psychiatry and neurology came together to study individuals. Through his in- depth study of the brain and behavior, Willis concluded that automated responses such as breathing, heartbeats and other various motor activities were carried out within the lower region of the brain. Although much of his work has been made obsolete, his ideas presented the brain as more complex than previously imagined, and led the way for future pioneers to understand and build upon his theories, especially when it came to looking at disorders and dysfunctions in the brain. = Franz Joseph Gall = Neuroanatomist and physiologist Franz Joseph Gall made major progress in understanding the brain. He theorized that personality was directly related to features and structures within the brain. However, Gall's major contribution within the field of neuroscience is his invention of phrenology. This new discipline looked at the brain as an organ of the mind, where the shape of the skull could ultimately determine one's intelligence and personality. This theory was like many circulating at the time, as many scientists were taking into account physical features of the face and body, head size, anatomical structure, and levels of intelligence; only Gall looked primarily at the brain. There was much debate over the validity of Gall's claims however, because he was often found to be wrong in his predictions. He was once sent a cast of Ren√© Descartes' skull, and through his method of phrenology claimed the subject must have had a limited capacity for reasoning and higher cognition. As controversial and false as many of Gall's claims were, his contributions to understanding cortical regions of the brain and localized activity continued to advance understanding of the brain, personality, and behavior. His work is considered crucial to having laid a firm foundation in the field of neuropsychology, which would flourish over the next few decades. = Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud = Jean-Baptiste Bouillaud Towards the late 19th century, the belief that the size of ones skull could determine their level of intelligence was discarded as science and medicine moved forward. A physician by the name of Jean- Baptiste Bouillaud expanded upon the ideas of Gall and took a closer look at the idea of distinct cortical regions of the brain each having their own independent function. Bouillaud was specifically interested in speech and wrote many publications on the anterior region of the brain being responsible for carrying out the act of ones speech, a discovery that had stemmed from the research of Gall. He was also one of the first to use larger samples for research although it took many years for that method to be accepted. By looking at over a hundred different case studies, Bouillaud came to discover that it was through different areas of the brain that speech is completed and understood. By observing people with brain damage, his theory was made more concrete. Bouillaud, along with many other pioneers of the time made great advances within the field of neurology, especially when it came to localization of function. There are many arguable debates as to who deserves the most credit for such discoveries, and often, people remain unmentioned, but Paul Broca is perhaps one of the most famous and well known contributors to neuropsychology ‚Äì often referred to as \\"the father\\" of the discipline. = Paul Broca = Inspired by the advances being made in the area of localized function within the brain, Paul Broca committed much of his study to the phenomena of how speech is understood and produced. Through his study, it was discovered and expanded upon that we articulate via the left hemisphere. Broca's observations and methods are widely considered to be where neuropsychology really takes form as a recognizable and respected discipline. Armed with the understanding that specific, independent areas of the brain are responsible for articulation and understanding of speech, the brains abilities were finally being acknowledged as the complex and highly intricate organ that it is. Broca was essentially the first to fully break away from the ideas of phrenology and delve deeper into a more scientific and psychological view of the brain. = Karl Spencer Lashley = Lashley's works and theories that follow are summarized in his book Brain Mechanisms and Intelligence. Lashley's theory of the Engram was the driving force for much of his research. An engram was believed to be a part of the brain where a specific memory was stored. He continued to use the training/ablation method that Franz had taught him. He would train a rat to learn a maze and then use systematic lesions and removed sections of cortical tissue to see if the rat forgot what it had learned. Through his research with the rats, he learned that forgetting was dependent on the amount of tissue removed and not where it was removed from. He called this mass action and he believed that it was a general rule that governed how brain tissue would respond, independent of the type of learning. But we know now that mass action was a misinterpretation of his empirical results, because in order to run a maze the rats required multiple cortical areas. Cutting into small individual parts alone will not impair the rats' brains much, but taking large sections removes multiple cortical areas at one time, affecting various functions such as sight, motor coordination and memory, making the animal unable to run a maze properly. Lashley also proposed that a portion of a functional area could carry out the role of the entire area, even when the rest of the area has been removed. He called this phenomenon equipotentiality. We know now that he was seeing evidence of plasticity in the brain: within certain constraints the brain has the ability for certain areas to take over the functions of other areas if those areas should fail or be removed - although not to the extent initially argued by Lashley.  Approaches  Experimental neuropsychology is an approach that uses methods from experimental psychology to uncover the relationship between the nervous system and cognitive function. The majority of work involves studying healthy humans in a laboratory setting, although a minority of researchers may conduct animal experiments. Human work in this area often takes advantage of specific features of our nervous system (for example that visual information presented to a specific visual field is preferentially processed by the cortical hemisphere on the opposite side) to make links between neuroanatomy and psychological function. Clinical neuropsychology is the application of neuropsychological knowledge to the assessment (see neuropsychological test and neuropsychological assessment), management, and rehabilitation of people who have suffered illness or injury (particularly to the brain) which has caused neurocognitive problems. In particular they bring a psychological viewpoint to treatment, to understand how such illness and injury may affect and be affected by psychological factors. They also can offer an opinion as to whether a person is demonstrating difficulties due to brain pathology or as a consequence of an emotional or another (potentially) reversible cause or both. For example, a test might show that both patients X and Y are unable to name items that they have been previously exposed to within the past 20 minutes (indicating possible dementia). If patient Y can name some of them with further prompting (e.g. given a categorical clue such as being told that the item they could not name is a fruit), this allows a more specific diagnosis than simply dementia (Y appears to have the vascular type which is due to brain pathology but is usually at least somewhat reversible). Clinical neuropsychologists often work in hospital settings in an interdisciplinary medical team; others work in private practice and may provide expert input into medico-legal proceedings. Cognitive neuropsychology is a relatively new development and has emerged as a distillation of the complementary approaches of both experimental and clinical neuropsychology. It seeks to understand the mind and brain by studying people who have suffered brain injury or neurological illness. One model of neuropsychological functioning is known as functional localization. This is based on the principle that if a specific cognitive problem can be found after an injury to a specific area of the brain, it is possible that this part of the brain is in some way involved. However, there may be reason to believe that the link between mental functions and neural regions is not so simple. An alternative model of the link between mind and brain, such as parallel processing, may have more explanatory power for the workings and dysfunction of the human brain. Yet another approach investigates how the pattern of errors produced by brain-damaged individuals can constrain our understanding of mental representations and processes without reference to the underlying neural structure. A more recent but related approach is cognitive neuropsychiatry which seeks to understand the normal function of mind and brain by studying psychiatric or mental illness. Connectionism is the use of artificial neural networks to model specific cognitive processes using what are considered to be simplified but plausible models of how neurons operate. Once trained to perform a specific cognitive task these networks are often damaged or 'lesioned' to simulate brain injury or impairment in an attempt to understand and compare the results to the effects of brain injury in humans. Functional neuroimaging uses specific neuroimaging technologies to take readings from the brain, usually when a person is doing a particular task, in an attempt to understand how the activation of particular brain areas is related to the task. In particular, the growth of methodologies to employ cognitive testing within established functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques to study brain- behavior relations is having a notable influence on neuropsychological research. In practice these approaches are not mutually exclusive and most neuropsychologists select the best approach or approaches for the task to be completed.  Methods and tools  ; Standardized neuropsychological tests : These tasks have been designed so the performance on the task can be linked to specific neurocognitive processes.Boyle, G.J., Saklofske, D.H., & Matthews, G. (2012). (Eds.), SAGE Benchmarks in Psychology: Psychological Assessment, Vol. 3: Clinical Neuropsychological Assessment. London: SAGE. These tests are typically standardized, meaning that they have been administered to a specific group (or groups) of individuals before being used in individual clinical cases. The data resulting from standardization are known as normative data. After these data have been collected and analyzed, they are used as the comparative standard against which individual performances can be compared. Examples of neuropsychological tests include: the Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS), the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (WAIS), Boston Naming Test, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test, the Benton Visual Retention Test, and the Controlled Oral Word Association. ; Brain scans : The use of brain scans to investigate the structure or function of the brain is common, either as simply a way of better assessing brain injury with high resolution pictures, or by examining the relative activations of different brain areas. Such technologies may include fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) and positron emission tomography (PET), which yields data related to functioning, as well as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and computed axial tomography (CAT or CT), which yields structural data. ; Global Brain Project : Brain models based on mouse and monkey have been developed based on theoretical neuroscience involving working memory and attention, while mapping brain activity based on time constants validated by measurements of neuronal activity in various layers of the brain. These methods also map to decision states of behavior in simple tasks that involve binary outcomes. ; Electrophysiology : The use of electrophysiological measures designed to measure the activation of the brain by measuring the electrical or magnetic field produced by the nervous system. This may include electroencephalography (EEG) or magneto-encephalography (MEG). ; Experimental tasks : The use of designed experimental tasks, often controlled by computer and typically measuring reaction time and accuracy on a particular tasks thought to be related to a specific neurocognitive process. An example of this is the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) or CNS Vital Signs (CNSVS).

The film is based on the X-Men superhero team appearing in Marvel Comics. It is the sequel to X-Men (2000), as well as the second installment in the X-Men film series, and features an ensemble cast including Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Brian Cox, Alan Cumming, Bruce Davison, and Anna Paquin. Its plot, inspired by the graphic novel God Loves, Man Kills, concerns the genocidal Colonel William Stryker leading an assault on Professor Xavier's school to build his own version of Xavier's mutant-tracking computer Cerebro, in order to destroy every mutant on Earth and to \\"save\\" the human race from them, forcing the X-Men to team up with the Brotherhood of Mutants, their former enemies, to stop Stryker and save the mutant race. Development on the sequel began shortly after the first film was released in 2000. David Hayter and Zak Penn wrote separate scripts, combining what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay. Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris were eventually hired to rewrite the work, and changed the characterizations of Beast, Angel, and Lady Deathstrike. Sentinels and the Danger Room were set to appear before being deleted because of budget concerns. The film's premise was influenced by the Marvel Comics storylines Return to Weapon X and God Loves, Man Kills. Filming began in June 2002 and ended that November, mostly taking place at Vancouver Film Studios, the largest North American production facility outside of Los Angeles. Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas adapted similar designs by John Myhre from the previous film. X2 was released in the United States on May 2, 2003 by 20th Century Fox, and received positive reviews for its storyline, action sequences, and performances. The film grossed $407million worldwide, and received eight Saturn Awards nominations. A sequel, X-Men: The Last Stand, was released on May 26, 2006. Plot At the White House, brainwashed teleporting mutant Nightcrawler attacks the President of the United States. He is shot and retreats. Meanwhile, Logan explores an abandoned military installation at Alkali Lake in Alberta for clues to his past, but finds nothing. Jean Grey has been having premonitions and struggles to concentrate as her powers become increasingly difficult to control. Later, Logan returns to Professor Xavier's school for mutants, and Xavier tracks Nightcrawler using Cerebro. Xavier and Cyclops go to question the imprisoned Magneto about the attack, while X-Men Storm and Jean Grey retrieve Nightcrawler. Military scientist Colonel William Stryker approaches the president and receives approval to investigate Xavier's mansion for their ties to mutants in the wake of the recent attack. Stryker's forces invade the school and abduct some of the students. Colossus leads the remaining students to safety while Logan, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro escape, and Stryker's assistant Yuriko Oyama captures Cyclops and Xavier. During the attack, Logan confronts Stryker, who addresses him as Wolverine and seems to know about his past. The shape-shifting Mystique gains information about Magneto's prison and helps him escape while also discovering schematics for a second Cerebro. Logan, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro visit Iceman's parents in Boston and meet up with Storm, Jean, and Nightcrawler. The X-Jet is attacked by fighter jets while flying back to the mansion and is shot down, but Magneto saves them from crashing. Magneto explains to the group that Stryker has built the second Cerebro to use it and Xavier to telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. Stryker's son, Jason, is a mutant with mind-controlling powers, whom Stryker will use to force Xavier to do this. Stryker had also previously used Jason's powers to orchestrate Nightcrawler's attack as a pretense to gain approval to invade Xavier's mansion. Magneto also tells Wolverine that Stryker was the man who grafted his adamantium skeleton onto his bones and is responsible for his amnesia. Jean reads Nightcrawler's mind and determines that Stryker's base is underground in a dam at Alkali Lake. Disguised as Logan, Mystique infiltrates Stryker's base. She lets the rest of the mutants in and Magneto and Mystique go to disable Cerebro before the brainwashed Xavier can activate it. Storm and Nightcrawler rescue the captured students, and Jean fights a mind-controlled Cyclops; their battle frees Cyclops but damages the dam, which begins to rupture. Logan finds Stryker in an adamantium smelting lab and remembers it as where he received his adamantium skeleton. Logan fights and kills Yuriko, then chases Stryker to a helicopter pad and chains him to the helicopter's wheel. Magneto stops Cerebro and, using Mystique impersonating Stryker to command Jason, has Xavier redirect its powers on normal humans. The two subsequently use Stryker's helicopter to escape, accompanied by Pyro, who has been swayed to Magneto's views. Nightcrawler teleports Storm inside Cerebro, where she creates a snowstorm to break Jason's concentration and free Xavier from his control. The X-Men flee the dam as water engulfs it, killing Stryker, but the X-Jet loses all power and struggles to take flight as the flood water rushes towards them. Jean sneaks off the jet and telepathically wishes the team goodbye. She holds back the water and raises the jet above it as flames erupt from her body, until she lets go and allows the flood to crash down upon her, presumably killing her. The X-Men give the president Stryker's files, and Xavier warns him that humans and mutants must work together to build peace. Back at the school, Xavier, Cyclops, and Logan remember Jean, and Xavier begins to hold a class. Meanwhile, a Phoenix-like shape rises from the flooded Alkali Lake. Cast * Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier / Professor X: A powerful telepathic mutant confined to a wheelchair who founded a School for \\"Gifted Youngsters\\", Xavier is a pacifist who believes humans and mutants can live together in harmony. He uses the Cerebro device, designed by Magneto and himself, to track and locate mutants across the world. A natural genius, Xavier is regarded as an authority on genetic mutation. * Hugh Jackman as Logan / Wolverine: A mysterious mutant who suffers from amnesia and has little to no recollection of his past life before he was grafted with an indestructible adamantium skeleton. Wolverine is a gruff loner, but is in love with Jean Grey and acts as a father figure to Rogue. He wields three highly durable adamantium blades that come out of each of his fists, has keen animal-like senses, the ability to heal rapidly from virtually any injury, and is a ruthless and aggressive fighter. * Ian McKellen as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto: Once Xavier's ally, Magneto now believes mutants are superior to humans and that a genetic war is coming. Magneto wields the ability to manipulate metal magnetically, as well as the power to create magnetic fields and fly. He wears a helmet that renders him immune to Xavier's powers and all related telepathic powers. Imprisoned after his scheme in the first film, he is drugged by William Stryker for information over Cerebro and the Xavier Institute, before making his escape and forming an alliance with the X-Men to stop Stryker. He has demonstrated sophisticated knowledge in matters of genetic manipulation and engineering. The character's helmet was slightly redesigned as McKellen found wearing it uncomfortable in X-Men.Louise Mingenbach, United Colors of X2, 2003, 20th Century Fox * Halle Berry as Ororo Munroe / Storm: An African mutant and teacher at Xavier's School who can control the weather with her mind. Storm befriends Nightcrawler. Berry dropped out of Jennifer Lopez's role in Gigli to reprise the role. * Famke Janssen as Dr. Jean Grey: A teacher at Xavier's school and the X-Mansion's doctor, Jean has begun to experience a growth in her telepathy and telekinetic powers since the X-Men's battle with Magneto. She is Cyclops' fianc√©, even though she is attracted to Wolverine. * James Marsden as Scott Summers / Cyclops: The field leader of the X-Men, and a teacher at Xavier's Institute, he shoots uncontrollable beams of concussive force from his eyes and wears a visor to control them. He is engaged to Jean. Cyclops is taken prisoner and brainwashed by Stryker. * Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Raven Darkh√∂lme / Mystique: Magneto's shapeshifting henchwoman, Mystique is blue, covered in scales, and acts as a spy. She injects a prison guard with metal, with which Magneto makes his escape, and also sexually tempts Wolverine. Romijn's makeup previously took nine hours to apply during the filming of X-Men, but the make-up department was able to bring it down to six hours for X2. * Brian Cox as Colonel William Stryker: A human military scientist who plans a worldwide genocide of mutants using Xavier and Cerebro. Stryker has experimented on mutants in the past, including Wolverine, and uses a serum to control them. Singer opted to cast Cox in the role as he was a fan of his performance as Hannibal Lecter in Manhunter.Singer, Bryan, Sigel, Newton Thomas, DVD audio commentary, 2003, 20th Century Fox * Alan Cumming as Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler: A kindly German mutant with a strong Catholic faith, yet ironically he has the appearance of a blue demon. Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X-Men. He is capable of teleporting himself (and others) instantly from one location to another. On his body are many tattoos, one for every sin. Cumming had always been Singer's choice for the role, but Cumming could not accept the part due to scheduling conflicts. Ethan Embry had been reported to be in contention for the role, but the film labored in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part. Singer also felt comfortable in casting Cumming since he is fluent in German. The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler's makeup design, which took four hours to apply. For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off, Cumming went through nine hours.Alan Cumming, Introducing the Incredible Nightcrawler, 2003, 20th Century Fox To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character. * Bruce Davison as Senator Robert Kelly: Although Kelly was killed in the first film, Davison reprised the role for scenes where Mystique uses his persona to infiltrate the government. * Anna Paquin as Marie / Rogue: A girl who can absorb any person's memories and abilities by touching them. As she cannot control this power, Rogue can easily kill anyone and thus is unable to be close to people. * Shawn Ashmore as Bobby Drake / Iceman: Rogue's boyfriend, he can freeze objects and create ice. His family is unaware that he is a mutant and simply believe he is at a boarding school. After returning home, Bobby reveals to them what he actually is, much to his brother's derision. * Aaron Stanford as John Allerdyce / Pyro: A friend of Bobby and Rogue, Pyro has anti-social tendencies and has the ability to control (although not create) fire. Magneto tells him that \\"You are a God amongst insects; never let anyone tell you different.\\" The filmmakers cast Stanford in the role after they were impressed with his performance in Tadpole. * Kelly Hu as Yuriko Oyama / Deathstrike: A female mutant who has a healing ability like Wolverine's and is controlled by Stryker. She wields long adamantium fingernails. Only her first name is mentioned in dialogue. * Daniel Cudmore as Peter Rasputin / Colossus: a mutant with the ability to turn his body into metal, the character's importance was reduced to a cameo. Additionally, Michael Reid MacKay portrayed Jason Stryker / Mutant 143, William Stryker's son who had the ability to create illusions. Keely Purvis portrayed the little girl whom Jason used as an avatar when controlling Xavier. Cotter Smith portrayed US President McKenna. Cameo appearances include Katie Stuart as Kitty Pryde, Bryce Hodgson as Artie, Kea Wong as Jubilation Lee / Jubilee, Steve Bacic as Dr. Hank McCoy and Shauna Kain as Theresa Rourke / Siryn. Gambit's cameo was shot, but the footage was not used in the final cut. Also in the final scene with Xavier, a girl is seen dressed in a Native American style jacket, as well as a blond haired boy dressed in blue, played by Layke Anderson. These were confirmed to be Danielle Moonstar and Douglas Ramsey.Michael Dougherty, Dan Harris, David Hayter, Lauren Shuler Donner, Ralph Winter, DVD audio commentary, 2003, 20th Century Fox Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris, the film's writers, cameo in scenes of Wolverine's Weapon X flashbacks as surgeons. Development =Writing= The financial and critical success of X-Men persuaded 20th Century Fox to immediately commission a sequel. Starting in November 2000,The Second Uncanny Issue of X-Men: Making X2 Documentary, 2003, 20th Century Fox Bryan Singer researched various storylines (one of them being the Legacy Virus) of the X-Men comic book series. Singer wanted to study, \\"the human perspective, the kind of blind rage that feeds into warmongering and terrorism,\\" citing a need for a \\"human villain\\". Bryan and producer Tom DeSanto envisioned X2 as the film series' equivalent to The Empire Strikes Back, in that the characters are \\"all split apart, and then dissected, and revelations occur that are significant... the romance comes to fruition and a lot of things happen.\\" Producer Avi Arad announced a planned November 2002 theatrical release date, while David Hayter and Zak Penn were hired to write separate scripts. Hayter and Penn combined what they felt to be the best elements of both scripts into one screenplay. Singer and Hayter worked on another script, finishing in October 2001. Concept art of the Danger Room before the setpiece was stored due to budgetary concerns Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris were hired to rewrite Hayter and Penn's script in February 2002, turning down the opportunity to write Urban Legends: Bloody Mary. Angel and Beast appeared in early drafts, but were deleted because there were too many characters. Dr. Hank McCoy can be seen on a television interview in one scene. Beast's appearance was to resemble Jim Lee's 1991 artwork of the character in the series X-Men: Legacy. Angel was to have been a mutant experiment by William Stryker, transforming into Archangel. A reference to Dougherty's and Harris's efforts to include Angel remains in the form of an X-ray on display in one of Stryker's labs. Tyler Mane was to reprise as Sabretooth before the character was deleted. In Hayter's script, the role eventually filled by Lady Deathstrike was Anne Reynolds, a character who appeared in God Loves, Man Kills as Stryker's personal assistant/assassin. Singer changed her to Deathstrike, citing a need for \\"another kick-ass mutant\\". There was to be more development on Cyclops and Professor X being brainwashed by Stryker. The scenes were shot, but Fox cut them out because of time length and story complications. Hayter was disappointed, feeling that James Marsden deserved more screentime. Rewrites were commissioned once more, specifically to give Halle Berry more screen time. This was because of her recent popularity in Monster's Ball, earning her the Academy Award for Best Actress. A budget cut meant that the Sentinels and the Danger Room were dropped. Guy Hendrix Dyas and a production crew had already constructed the Danger Room set. In the words of Dyas, \\"The control room [of the Danger Room] was a large propeller that actually rotated around the room so that you can sit up [in that control room] and travel around the subject who is in the middle of the control room. The idea for the traveling is that if it's a mutant has some kind of mind control powers they can't connect.\\" =Production= Producer Lauren Shuler Donner had hoped to start filming in March 2002, but production did not begin until June 17, 2002 in Vancouver and ended by November. Over sixty-four sets were used in thirty-eight different locations. The film crew encountered problems when there was insufficient snow in Kananaskis, Alberta for them to use for some scenes. A large amount of fake snow was then applied. The idea to have Jean Grey sacrifice herself at the end and to be resurrected in a third installment was highly secretive. Singer did not tell Famke Janssen until midway through filming. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel and two stunt drivers nearly died when filming the scene in which Pyro has a dispute with police officers. John Ottman composed the score. Ottman established a new title theme, as well as themes specifically for Magneto, Jean Grey, Nightcrawler, Mystique, and Pyro. =Design and effects= Nightcrawler's tail was mainly computer-generated, although Alan Cumming sometimes used one made of rubber. Singer and Sigel credited Road to Perdition as a visual influence. Though Sigel shot the first X-Men in anamorphic format, he opted to shoot X2 in Super 35. Sigel felt the recent improvements in film stocks and optics increased the advantages of using spherical lenses, even if the blowup to anamorphic must be accomplished optically instead of digitally. Sigel noted, \\"If you think about it, every anamorphic lens is simply a spherical lens with an anamorphizer on it. They'll never be as good as the spherical lenses that they emulate.\\" Cameras that were used during filming included two Panaflex Millenniums and a Millennium XL, as well as an Aaton 35mm. Singer also used zoom lenses more often than he did in his previous films, while Sigel used a Frazier lens specifically for dramatic moments. The Blackbird was redesigned and increased in virtual size from 60 feet to 85 feet. John Myhre served as the production designer on the first film, but Singer hired Guy Hendrix Dyas for X2, which was his first film as a production designer.Dyas, Guy, Evolution in the Details: Designing X2 (Documentary), 2003, 20th Century Fox For scenes involving Stryker's Alkali Base, Vancouver Film Studios, the largest sound stage in North America, was reserved. Visual effects supervisor Mike Fink was not satisfied with his work on the previous film, despite the fact it nearly received an Academy Award nomination.Mike Fink ‚Äì Interview. Sci-Fi Online. Retrieved August 24, 2015. Up to 520 shots were created for X-Men, while X2 commissioned roughly 800. A new computer program was created by Rhythm and Hues for the dogfight tornado scene. Cinesite was in charge of scenes concerning Cerebro, enlisting a 20-man crew. The Alkali Lake Dam miniature was high and wide.FX2 Visual Effects, 2003, 20th Century Fox Cinesite created 300 visual effects shots, focusing on character animation, while Rhythm and Hues created over 100. =Post-production= The first cut of X2 was rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America, due to violent shots with Logan when Stryker's army storms the X-Mansion. A few seconds were cut to secure a PG-13 rating. Release The film premiered in London on April 24, 2003, and then had the widest release ever, opening on May 2, 2003, in 93 markets, on 7,316 screens overseas and in 3,741 theaters in the United States and Canada. Reception =Box office= X2 opened May 2, 2003, accumulating $85,558,731 on its opening weekend in 3,749 theaters in the United States and Canada. Overseas it grossed $69.27million in its first five days, including previews. The film grossed $214,949,694 in the United States and Canada, the sixth- highest-grossing film of 2003, earning $192,761,855 overseas, for a worldwide total of $407,711,549, the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2003. It earned $107million in its first five days of DVD release. =Critical response= X2 received positive reviews, with praise aimed at the acting, action, and story. The review-aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 85% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 244 reviews with an average score of 7.5/10. The website's consensus states: \\"Tightly scripted, solidly acted, and impressively ambitious, X2: X-Men United is bigger and better than its predecessor‚Äîand a benchmark for comic sequels in general.\\" Metacritic calculated a weighted average score of 68/100 based on reviews from 37 critics, indicating generally favorable reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A on scale of A to F. Roger Ebert was impressed by how Singer was able to handle so many characters in one film, but felt \\"the storyline did not live up to its potential\\". In addition, Ebert wrote that the film's closing was perfect for a future installment, giving X2 three out of four stars. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times wrote that it was rare for a sequel to be better than its predecessor. Turan observed that the film carried emotional themes that are present in the world today and commented that \\"the acting was better than usual [for a superhero film]\\". Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote that Hugh Jackman heavily improved his performance, concluding \\"X2 is a summer firecracker. It's also a tribute to outcasts, teens, gays, minorities, even Dixie Chicks.\\" Empire called X2 the best comic book movie of all time in 2006, while Wizard named the film's ending as the 22nd greatest cliffhanger of all time. In May 2007, Rotten Tomatoes listed X2 as the fifth greatest comic book film of all time. The film won the Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film. In addition, Bryan Singer (Direction), Dan Harris and Michael Dougherty (Writing), and John Ottman (Music) all received nominations. It also received nominations for its costumes, makeup, special effects and DVD release, amounting to a total of eight nominations. The Political Film Society honored X2 in the categories of Human Rights and Peace, while the film was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation (Long Form). Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle was critical of the storyline, special effects and action scenes. Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal specifically referred to the film as \\"fast-paced, slow-witted\\". Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post wrote \\"Of the many comic book superhero movies, this is by far the lamest, the loudest, the longest\\". Richard Corliss of Time argued that Singer depended too much on seriousness and that he did not have enough sensibilities to communicate to an audience. Music The film's score was composed by John Ottman, a regular collaborator with film director Bryan Singer. The soundtrack album X2: Original Motion Picture Score was released on April 29, 2003. Ottman used a sample of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's Requiem as the basis for the music in scenes featuring Nightcrawler. As well as the music on the album, tracks by Conjure One and 'N Sync also featured in the film.X2: X-Men United. Soundtrack.net. Retrieved August 24, 2015.

The technique involves pressing a velveteen-covered disk, and then imprinting secondary plates with cells in colonies removed from the original plate by the material. Generally, large numbers of colonies (roughly 30-300) are replica plated due to the difficulty in streaking each out individually onto a separate plate. A sterile velvet on a plastic block for replica plating The purpose of replica plating is to be able to compare the master plate and any secondary plates, typically to screen for a desired phenotype. For example, when a colony that was present on the primary plate (or master dish), fails to appear on a secondary plate, it shows that the colony was sensitive to a substance on that particular secondary plate. Common screenable phenotypes include auxotrophy and antibiotic resistance. Replica plating is especially useful for \\"negative selection\\". However, it is more correct to refer to \\"negative screening\\" instead of using the term 'selection'. For example, if one wanted to select colonies that were sensitive to ampicillin, the primary plate could be replica plated on a secondary Amp+ agar plate. The sensitive colonies on the secondary plate would die but the colonies could still be deduced from the primary plate since the two have the same spatial patterns from ampicillin resistant colonies. The sensitive colonies could then be picked off from the primary plate. Frequently the last plate will be non- selective. In the figure, a nonselective plate will be replica plated after the Amp+ plate to confirm that the absence of growth on the selective plate is due to the selection itself and not a problem with transferring cells. If one sees growth on the third (nonselective) plate but not the second one, the selective agent is responsible for the lack of growth. If the non-selective plate shows no growth, one cannot say whether viable cells were transferred at all, and no conclusions can be made about the presence or absence of growth on selective media. This is particularly useful if there are questions about the age or viability of the cells on the original plate. By increasing the variety of secondary plates with different selective growth media, it is possible to rapidly screen a large number of individual isolated colonies for as many phenotypes as there are secondary plates. The development of replica plating required two steps. The first step was to define the problem: a method of identifiably duplicating colonies. The second step was to devise a means to reliably implement the first step. Replica plating was first described by Esther Lederberg and Joshua Lederberg in 1952.Lederberg, J and Lederberg, EM (1952) Replica plating and indirect selection of bacterial mutants.

A web application (or web app) is application software that runs on a web server, unlike computer-based software programs that are stored locally on the Operating System (OS) of the device. Web applications are accessed by the user through a web browser with an active internet connection. These applications are programmed using a client‚Äìserver modeled structure‚Äîthe user (\\"client\\") is provided services through an off-site server that is hosted by a third-party. Examples of commonly-used web applications include: web-mail, online retail sales, online banking, and online auctions. Definition and similar terms The general distinction between a dynamic web page of any kind and a \\"web app\\" is unclear. Web sites most likely to be referred to as \\"web applications\\" are those which have similar functionality to a desktop software application, or to a mobile app. HTML5 introduced explicit language support for making applications that are loaded as web pages, but can store data locally and continue to function while offline. Single-page applications are more application-like because they reject the more typical web paradigm of moving between distinct pages with different URLs. Single-page frameworks might be used to speed development of such a web app for a mobile platform. = Mobile web application = There are several ways of targeting mobile devices when making a web application: * Responsive web design can be used to make a web application - whether a conventional website or a single-page application viewable on small screens that works well with touchscreens. * Progressive Web Apps (PWA) are web applications that load like regular web pages or websites but can offer the user functionality such as working offline and device hardware access traditionally available only to native mobile applications. * Native apps or \\"mobile apps\\" run directly on a mobile device, just as a conventional software application runs directly on a desktop computer, without a web browser (and potentially without the need for Internet connectivity); these are typically written in Java (for Android devices) or Objective-C or Swift (for iOS devices). Recently, frameworks allow the development of native apps for all platforms using languages other than each standard native language. * Hybrid apps embed a web site inside a native app, possibly using a hybrid framework. This allows development using web technologies (and possibly directly copying code from an existing mobile web site) while also retaining certain advantages of native apps (e.g. direct access to device hardware, offline operation, app store visibility). Hybrid app frameworks include Apache Cordova, Electron, Haxe, React Native and Xamarin. History In earlier computing models like client‚Äìserver, the processing load for the application was shared between code on the server and code installed on each client locally. In other words, an application had its own precompiled client program which served as its user interface and had to be separately installed on each user's personal computer. An upgrade to the server-side code of the application would typically also require an upgrade to the client-side code installed on each user workstation, adding to the support cost and decreasing productivity. In addition, both the client and server components of the application were usually tightly bound to a particular computer architecture and operating system and porting them to others was often prohibitively expensive for all but the largest applications (Nowadays, native apps for mobile devices are also hobbled by some or all of the foregoing issues). In contrast, web applications use web documents written in a standard format such as HTML and JavaScript, which are supported by a variety of web browsers. Web applications can be considered as a specific variant of client‚Äìserver software where the client software is downloaded to the client machine when visiting the relevant web page, using standard procedures such as HTTP. Client web software updates may happen each time the web page is visited. During the session, the web browser interprets and displays the pages, and acts as the universal client for any web application. In the early days of the Web, each individual web page was delivered to the client as a static document, but the sequence of pages could still provide an interactive experience, as user input was returned through web form elements embedded in the page markup. However, every significant change to the web page required a round trip back to the server to refresh the entire page. In 1995, Netscape introduced a client-side scripting language called JavaScript allowing programmers to add some dynamic elements to the user interface that ran on the client side. So instead of sending data to the server in order to generate an entire web page, the embedded scripts of the downloaded page can perform various tasks such as input validation or showing/hiding parts of the page. In 1996, Macromedia introduced Flash, a vector animation player that could be added to browsers as a plug-in to embed animations on the web pages. It allowed the use of a scripting language to program interactions on the client side with no need to communicate with the server. In 1999, the \\"web application\\" concept was introduced in the Java language in the Servlet Specification version 2.2. [2.1?]. At that time both JavaScript and XML had already been developed, but Ajax had still not yet been coined and the XMLHttpRequest object had only been recently introduced on Internet Explorer 5 as an ActiveX object. In 2005, the term Ajax was coined, and applications like Gmail started to make their client sides more and more interactive. A web page script is able to contact the server for storing/retrieving data without downloading an entire web page. In 2014, HTML5 was finalized, which provides graphic and multimedia capabilities without the need of client side plug-ins. HTML5 also enriched the semantic content of documents. The APIs and document object model (DOM) are no longer afterthoughts, but are fundamental parts of the HTML5 specification. WebGL API paved the way for advanced 3D graphics based on HTML5 canvas and JavaScript language. These have significant importance in creating truly platform and browser independent rich web applications. Interface Through Java, JavaScript, DHTML, Flash, Silverlight and other technologies, application-specific methods such as drawing on the screen, playing audio, and access to the keyboard and mouse are all possible. Many services have worked to combine all of these into a more familiar interface that adopts the appearance of an operating system. General purpose techniques such as drag and drop are also supported by these technologies. Web developers often use client-side scripting to add functionality, especially to create an interactive experience that does not require page reloading. Recently, technologies have been developed to coordinate client-side scripting with server-side technologies such as ASP.NET, J2EE, Perl/Plack and PHP. Ajax, a web development technique using a combination of various technologies, is an example of technology which creates a more interactive experience. Structure Applications are usually broken into logical chunks called \\"tiers\\", where every tier is assigned a role. Traditional applications consist only of 1 tier, which resides on the client machine, but web applications lend themselves to an n-tiered approach by nature. Though many variations are possible, the most common structure is the three-tiered application. In its most common form, the three tiers are called presentation, application and storage, in this order. A web browser is the first tier (presentation), an engine using some dynamic Web content technology (such as ASP, CGI, ColdFusion, Dart, JSP/Java, Node.js, PHP, Python or Ruby on Rails) is the middle tier (application logic), and a database is the third tier (storage). The web browser sends requests to the middle tier, which services them by making queries and updates against the database and generates a user interface. For more complex applications, a 3-tier solution may fall short, and it may be beneficial to use an n-tiered approach, where the greatest benefit is breaking the business logic, which resides on the application tier, into a more fine-grained model. Another benefit may be adding an integration tier that separates the data tier from the rest of tiers by providing an easy-to-use interface to access the data. For example, the client data would be accessed by calling a \\"list_clients()\\" function instead of making an SQL query directly against the client table on the database. This allows the underlying database to be replaced without making any change to the other tiers. There are some who view a web application as a two-tier architecture. This can be a \\"smart\\" client that performs all the work and queries a \\"dumb\\" server, or a \\"dumb\\" client that relies on a \\"smart\\" server. The client would handle the presentation tier, the server would have the database (storage tier), and the business logic (application tier) would be on one of them or on both. While this increases the scalability of the applications and separates the display and the database, it still doesn't allow for true specialization of layers, so most applications will outgrow this model. Business use An emerging strategy for application software companies is to provide web access to software previously distributed as local applications. Depending on the type of application, it may require the development of an entirely different browser-based interface, or merely adapting an existing application to use different presentation technology. These programs allow the user to pay a monthly or yearly fee for use of a software application without having to install it on a local hard drive. A company which follows this strategy is known as an application service provider (ASP), and ASPs are currently receiving much attention in the software industry. Security breaches on these kinds of applications are a major concern because it can involve both enterprise information and private customer data. Protecting these assets is an important part of any web application and there are some key operational areas that must be included in the development process. This includes processes for authentication, authorization, asset handling, input, and logging and auditing. Building security into the applications from the beginning can be more effective and less disruptive in the long run. Cloud computing model web applications are software as a service (SaaS). There are business applications provided as SaaS for enterprises for a fixed or usage-dependent fee. Other web applications are offered free of charge, often generating income from advertisements shown in web application interface. Development Writing web applications is often simplified by the use of web application framework. These frameworks facilitate rapid application development by allowing a development team to focus on the parts of their application which are unique to their goals without having to resolve common development issues such as user management. Many of the frameworks in use are open-source software. The use of web application frameworks can often reduce the number of errors in a program, both by making the code simpler, and by allowing one team to concentrate on the framework while another focuses on a specified use case. In applications which are exposed to constant hacking attempts on the Internet, security- related problems can be caused by errors in the program. Frameworks can also promote the use of best practices such as GET after POST. In addition, there is potential for the development of applications on Internet operating systems, although currently there are not many viable platforms that fit this model. Applications Examples of browser applications are simple office software (word processors, online spreadsheets, and presentation tools), but can also include more advanced applications such as project management, computer-aided design, video editing, and point-of-sale.

The simplest example of an instinctive behavior is a fixed action pattern (FAP), in which a very short to medium length sequence of actions, without variation, are carried out in response to a corresponding clearly defined stimulus. A baby leatherback turtle makes its way to the open ocean. Any behavior is instinctive if it is performed without being based upon prior experience (that is, in the absence of learning), and is therefore an expression of innate biological factors. Sea turtles, newly hatched on a beach, will automatically move toward the ocean. A marsupial climbs into its mother's pouch upon being born. Honeybees communicate by dancing in the direction of a food source without formal instruction. Other examples include animal fighting, animal courtship behavior, internal escape functions, and the building of nests. Though an instinct is defined by its invariant innate characteristics, details of its performance can be changed by experience; for example, a dog can improve its fighting skills by practice.An instinctive behavior of shaking water from wet fur Instincts are inborn complex patterns of behavior that exist in most members of the species, and should be distinguished from reflexes, which are simple responses of an organism to a specific stimulus, such as the contraction of the pupil in response to bright light or the spasmodic movement of the lower leg when the knee is tapped. The absence of volitional capacity must not be confused with an inability to modify fixed action patterns. For example, people may be able to modify a stimulated fixed action pattern by consciously recognizing the point of its activation and simply stop doing it, whereas animals without a sufficiently strong volitional capacity may not be able to disengage from their fixed action patterns, once activated. Instinctual behaviour in humans has been studied, and is a controversial topic. History Primitive reflexes =In animal biology= Jean Henri Fabre (1823-1915), an entomologist, considered instinct to be any behavior which did not require cognition or consciousness to perform. Fabre's inspiration was his intense study of insects, some of whose behaviors he wrongly considered fixed and not subject to environmental influence. Instinct as a concept fell out of favor in the 1920s with the rise of behaviorism and such thinkers as B. F. Skinner, which held that most significant behavior is learned. An interest in innate behaviors arose again in the 1950s with Konrad Lorenz and Nikolaas Tinbergen, who made the distinction between instinct and learned behaviors. Our modern understanding of instinctual behavior in animals owes much to their work. For instance, there exists a sensitive period for a bird in which it learns the identity of its mother. Konrad Lorenz famously had a goose imprint on his boots. Thereafter the goose would follow whoever wore the boots. This suggests that the identity of the goose's mother was learned, but the goose's behavior towards what it perceived as its mother was instinctive. =In psychology= The term \\"instinct\\" in psychology was first used in the 1870s by Wilhelm Wundt. By the close of the 19th century, most repeated behavior was considered instinctual. In a survey of the literature at that time, one researcher chronicled 4,000 human \\"instincts,\\" having applied this label to any behavior that was repetitive. In the early twentieth century, there was recognized a \\"union of instinct and emotion\\".James Rowland Angell, J.R. (1906). \\"The Important Human Instincts\\", Chapter 16 in Psychology: An Introductory Study of the Structure and Function of Human Consciousness, Third edition, revised. New York: Henry Holt and Company. https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Angell/Angell_1906/Angell_1906_p.html William McDougall held that many instincts have their respective associated specific emotions.McDougall, W. (1928). An Introduction to Social Psychology, 21st edition, Methuen & Co. Ltd, London, p. vii. As research became more rigorous and terms better defined, instinct as an explanation for human behavior became less common. In 1932, McDougall argued that the word 'instinct' is more suitable for describing animal behaviour, while he recommended the word 'propensity' for goal directed combinations of the many innate human abilities, which are loosely and variably linked, in a way that shows strong plasticity.McDougall, W. (1932). The Energies of Men: a Study of the Fundamentals of Dynamic Psychology, second edition, Methuen & Co. Ltd, London, p. 99. In a conference in 1960, chaired by Frank Beach, a pioneer in comparative psychology, and attended by luminaries in the field, the term 'instinct' was restricted in its application. During the 1960s and 1970s, textbooks still contained some discussion of instincts in reference to human behavior. By the year 2000, a survey of the 12 best selling textbooks in Introductory Psychology revealed only one reference to instincts, and that was in regard to Sigmund Freud's referral to the \\"id\\" instincts. In this sense, the term 'instinct' appeared to have become outmoded for introductory textbooks on human psychology. Sigmund Freud considered that mental images of bodily needs, expressed in the form of desires, are called instincts. In the 1950s, the psychologist Abraham Maslow argued that humans no longer have instincts because we have the ability to override them in certain situations. He felt that what is called instinct is often imprecisely defined, and really amounts to strong drives. For Maslow, an instinct is something which cannot be overridden, and therefore while the term may have applied to humans in the past, it no longer does. The book Instinct: an enduring problem in psychology (1961)Birney, R.C., Teevan, R.C. (1961). Instinct: an enduring problem in psychology, Van Nostrand, Princeton NJ. selected a range of writings about the topic. In a classic paper published in 1972, the psychologist Richard Herrnstein wrote: \\"A comparison of McDougall's theory of instinct and Skinner's reinforcement theory ‚Äî representing nature and nurture ‚Äî shows remarkable, and largely unrecognized, similarities between the contending sides in the nature-nurture dispute as applied to the analysis of behavior.\\" F.B. Mandal proposed a set of criteria by which a behavior might be considered instinctual: a) be automatic, b) be irresistible, c) occur at some point in development, d) be triggered by some event in the environment, e) occur in every member of the species, f) be unmodifiable, and g) govern behavior for which the organism needs no training (although the organism may profit from experience and to that degree the behavior is modifiable). In Information behavior: An Evolutionary Instinct (2010, pp. 35‚Äì42), Amanda Spink notes that \\"currently in the behavioral sciences instinct is generally understood as the innate part of behavior that emerges without any training or education in humans.\\" She claims that the viewpoint that information behavior has an instinctive basis is grounded in the latest thinking on human behavior. Furthermore, she notes that \\"behaviors such as cooperation, sexual behavior, child rearing and aesthetics are [also] seen as 'evolved psychological mechanisms' with an instinctive basis.\\" Spink adds that Steven Pinker similarly asserts that language acquisition is instinctive in humans in his book The Language Instinct (1994). In 1908, William McDougall wrote about the \\"instinct of curiosity\\" and its associated \\"emotion of wonder\\",McDougall, W. (1928). An Introduction to Social Psychology, 21st edition, Methuen & Co. Ltd, London, p. xxii. though Spink's book does not mention this. M.S. Blumberg in 2017 examined the use of the word instinct, and found it varied significantly. In humans The existence of simplest instincts in humans is a widely debated topic. #Congenital fear of snakes and spiders was found in six-month- old babies. #Infant cry is a manifestation of instinct. The infant cannot otherwise protect itself for survival during its long period of maturation. The maternal instinct, manifest particularly in response to the infant cry, has long been respected as one of the most powerful. Its mechanism has been partly elucidated by observations with functional MRI of the mother‚Äôs brain. #The herd instinct is found in human children and chimpanzee cubs, but is apparently absent in the young orangutans. #Testosterone (main male sex hormone) primes several instincts, especially sexuality; also dominance, manifest in self-affirmation, the urge to win over rivals (see competitiveness), to dominate a hierarchy (see dominance hierarchy), and to respond to violent signals in men (see aggression), with weakening of empathy. In men, a decrease in testosterone level after the birth of a child in the family was found, so that the father's energies are more directed to nurturing, protecting and caring for the child. Unduly high levels of this hormone are often associated in a person with aggressiveness, illegal behavior, violence against others, such phenomena as banditry, etc. This is confirmed by studies conducted in prisons. The amount of testosterone in men may increase dramatically in response to any competition. #Squeamishness and disgust in humans is an instinct developed during evolution to protect the body and avoid infection by various diseases. Reflexes A real gecko hunts the pointer of a mouse, confused with prey. Examples of behaviors that do not require conscious will include many reflexes. The stimulus in a reflex may not require brain activity but instead may travel to the spinal cord as a message that is then transmitted back through the body, tracing a path called the reflex arc. Reflexes are similar to fixed action patterns in that most reflexes meet the criteria of a FAP. However, a fixed action pattern can be processed in the brain as well; a male stickleback's instinctive aggression towards anything red during his mating season is such an example. Examples of instinctive behaviors in humans include many of the primitive reflexes, such as rooting and suckling, behaviors which are present in mammals. In rats, it has been observed that innate responses are related to specific chemicals, and these chemicals are detected by two organs located in the nose: the vomeronasal organ (VNO) and the main olfactory epithelium (MOE). Maturational Some instinctive behaviors depend on maturational processes to appear. For instance, we commonly refer to birds \\"learning\\" to fly. However, young birds have been experimentally reared in devices that prevent them from moving their wings until they reached the age at which their cohorts were flying. These birds flew immediately and normally when released, showing that their improvement resulted from neuromuscular maturation and not true learning. In evolution Imprinting provides one example of instinct. This complex response may involve visual, auditory, and olfactory cues in the environment surrounding an organism. In some cases, imprinting attaches an offspring to its parent, which is a reproductive benefit to offspring survival. If an offspring has attachment to a parent, it is more likely to stay nearby under parental protection. Attached offspring are also more likely to learn from a parental figure when interacting closely. (Reproductive benefits are a driving force behind natural selection.) Environment is an important factor in how innate behavior has evolved. A hypothesis of Michael McCollough, a positive psychologist, explains that environment plays a key role in human behaviors such as forgiveness and revenge. This hypothesis theorizes that various social environments cause either forgiveness or revenge to prevail. McCollough relates his theory to game theory. In a tit-for-tat strategy, cooperation and retaliation are comparable to forgiveness and revenge. The choice between the two can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on what the partner-organism chooses. Though this psychological example of game theory does not have such directly measurable results, it provides an interesting theory of unique thought. From a more biological standpoint, the brain's limbic system operates as the main control-area for response to certain stimuli, including a variety of instinctual behavior. The limbic system processes external stimuli related to emotions, social activity, and motivation, which propagates a behavioral response. Some behaviors include maternal care, aggression, defense, and social hierarchy. These behaviors are influenced by sensory input ‚Äî sight, sound, touch, and smell. Within the circuitry of the limbic system, there are various places where evolution could have taken place, or could take place in the future. For example, many rodents have receptors in the vomeronasal organ that respond explicitly to predator stimuli that specifically relate to that individual species of rodent. The reception of a predatory stimulus usually creates a response of defense or fear. Mating in rats follows a similar mechanism. The vomeronasal organ and the main olfactory epithelium, together called the olfactory system, detect pheromones from the opposite sex. These signals then travel to the medial amygdala, which disperses the signal to a variety of brain parts. The pathways involved with innate circuitry are extremely specialized and specific. Various organs and sensory receptors play parts in this complex process. Instinct is a phenomenon that can be investigated from a multitude of angles: genetics, limbic system, nervous pathways, and environment. Researchers can study levels of instincts, from molecular to groups of individuals. Extremely specialized systems have evolved, resulting in individuals which exhibit behaviors without learning them.

It may affect a small and localized group or impact upon thousands of people across an entire continent. Four linked cases of a rare infectious disease may be sufficient to constitute an outbreak. Outbreaks include epidemics, which term is normally only used for infectious diseases, as well as diseases with an environmental origin, such as a water or foodborne disease. They may affect a region in a country or a group of countries. Pandemics are near-global disease outbreaks when multiple countries across the world are infected. Definition The terms \\"outbreak\\" and \\"epidemic\\" have often been used interchangeably. Researchers Manfred S. Green and colleagues propose that the latter term be restricted to larger events, pointing out that Chambers Concise Dictionary and Stedman's Medical Dictionary acknowledge this distinction. Outbreak investigation Epidemic curves When investigating disease outbreaks, the epidemiology profession has developed a number of widely accepted steps. As described by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these include the following:Steps of an Outbreak Investigation, EXCITE  Epidemiology in the Classroom  Outbreak Steps * Identify the existence of the outbreak (Is the group of ill persons normal for the time of year, geographic area, etc.?) * Verify the diagnosis related to the outbreak * Create a case definition to define who/what is included as a case * Map the spread of the outbreak using Information technology as diagnosis is reported to insurance * Develop a hypothesis (What appears to be causing the outbreak?) * Study hypotheses (collect data and perform analysis) * Refine hypothesis and carry out further study * Develop and implement control and prevention systems * Release findings to greater communities The order of the above steps and relative amount of effort and resources used in each varies from outbreak to outbreak. For example, prevention and control measures are usually implemented very early in the investigation, often before the causative agent is known. In many situations, promoting good hygiene and hand-washing is one of the first things recommended. Other interventions may be added as the investigation moves forward and more information is obtained. Waiting until the end of an investigation to implement prevention and control measures is a sure way to lose ones job. In outbreaks identified through notifiable disease surveillance, reports are often linked to laboratory results and verifying the diagnosis is straight forward. In outbreaks of unknown etiology, determining and verifying the diagnosis can be a significant part of the investigation with respect to time and resources. Several steps are usually going on at any point in time during the investigation. Steps may be repeated. For example, initial case definitions are often established to be intentionally broad but later refined as more is learned about the outbreak. The above list has 9 steps, others have more. Implementing active surveillance to identify additional cases is often added. Outbreak debriefing and review has also been recognized as an additional final step and iterative process by the Public Health Agency of Canada. Types There are several outbreak patterns, which can be useful in identifying the transmission method or source, and predicting the future rate of infection. Each has a distinctive epidemic curve, or histogram of case infections and deaths. * Common source ‚Äì All victims acquire the infection from the same source (e.g. a contaminated water supply).Glossary of Epidemiology Terms, Cdc.gov (2007-04-25).

Christian denomination in the form of a national church in the Philippines. Its schism from the Roman Catholic Church was proclaimed in 1902 by the members of the Uni√≥n Obrera Democr√°tica Filipina, due to the mistreatment of the Filipinos by Spanish priests and the execution of Jos√© Rizal during Spanish colonial rule.

Members commonly believe in the rejection of the exclusivity right to apostolic succession by the Petrine papacy, the allowing of priestly ordination of women, optional clerical celibacy, tolerance of Freemasonry, and support for contraception and same-sex civil rights, however the members of the Church still believe in transubstantiation and the Real presence of Christ in the Eucharist. Many saints canonized by Rome after the 1902 schism are not recognized by the Aglipayan church and its members. the Supreme Bishop was Rhee Timbang, whose central office is located at the National Cathedral of the Holy Child in Ermita, Manila. Name The church's official name is Iglesia Filipina Independiente, or, in English, the Philippine Independent Church. The church or its members are referred to by the acronym IFI as well as by a variety of names in the various languages of the Philippines, such as ; ; and . History President Emilio Aguinaldo and Obispo M√°ximo Gregorio Aglipay, with some Cabinet officials of the First Philippine Republic, December 1904. =Philippine Revolution and Gregorio Aglipay= Gregorio Aglipay in his youth before excommunication. Gregorio Aglipay was an activist and a Roman Catholic priest from Ilocos Norte who would later be excommunicated by then Archbishop of Manila Bernardino Nozaleda y Villa for fomenting schism with the Pope. During the Philippine Revolution, Isabelo de los Reyes (also known as Don Belong) and Aglipay acted to reform the Filipino Catholic clergy. Aglipay was the convener of the Filipino Ecclesiastical Council (Paniqui Assembly), in response to Mabini's manifesto urging the Filipino clergy to organize a Filipino national Church. He was a member of the Malolos Congress, the lone member coming from the religious sector, although he also represented Ilocos Norte. He was a guerilla leader of Ilocos Norte during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War with the rank of lieutenant general. Following the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War, Aglipay and De los Reyes founded the Philippine Independent Church in 1902. The new church rejected the spiritual authority of the Pope (then Pope Leo XIII) and abolished the celibacy requirement for priests, allowing them to marry. At that time, all of its clergy were former Catholic priests. Aglipay drew upon the Masons for some concepts of theology and worship. He was supported by Miguel Morayta, the Grand Master of the Spanish Orient Lodge of Freemasonry in Madrid.Schumacher, John N., Revolutionary Clergy: The Filipino Clergy and the Nationalist Movement, 1850-1903, p. 224, Ateneo de Manila U Press, , Aglipay became a Mason in 1918.Denslow, William R., 10,000 Famous Freemasons, Part One, p. 7 (Kessinger Publishing, 2004) , The historian John N. Schumacher contends that Morayta and other non-Filipino laymen pushed Aglipay toward schism with the Catholic Church because of their resentment of the activities of Catholic religious orders in the Philippines rather than Filipino nationalism. The new Iglesia Filipina Independiente reformed the Latin Tridentine liturgy, adopting the vernacular in worship, and modeling its liturgy on the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. Mass in the IFI has been said in Spanish since the earliest days of its independence, but it is also said in Tagalog. Visiting other churches while traveling abroad, Aglipay developed his theology, coming to reject the divinity of Jesus and the concept of the Trinity and becoming theologically Unitarian. Other IFI officials refused to accept this revised theology. Aglipay's unitarian, rationalist, and progressive theological ideas were evident in the church's Catecismo (1905) Digitized by the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa√±a. and Oficio Divino (1906), Digitized by the Biblioteca Nacional de Espa√±a. and in his novena, Pagsisiyam sa Birhen sa Balintawak, 1925Aglipay, Gregorio, Pagsisiyam sa Birhen sa Balintawak , 1925 and its English translation, Novenary of the Motherland (1926). Aglipay, Gregorio, Novenary of the Motherland , 1926 Winning large numbers of adherents in its early years because of its nationalist roots, Aglipayan numbers decreased due to factionalism and doctrinal disagreements. The American government of occupation, after the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War ended in July 1902, decided to return to the Catholic Church those parish buildings that had become Aglipayan during the Philippine Revolution and this further limited church growth. There were tensions within the church from the beginning between Aglipay's liberal followers and more traditional members. Eventually there would be a schism: after Aglipay's death in 1940 the courts awarded the name and assets to the Trinitarian faction. Some factions formally joined other denominations including the Episcopal Church and the American Unitarians. In 1961, the IFI joined the Anglican Communion and its bishops were re-consecrated into the historic succession of the Anglican line. =Present= Today, Aglipayans in the Philippines claim to number at least 6 to 8 million members, with most from the northern part of Luzon, especially in the Ilocos Region, the province of Zambales, the Southern Luzon province of Cavite, parts of Visayas like the provinces of Antique, Iloilo and Guimaras, and in the Northern Mindanaon province of Misamis Occidental. Congregations are also found throughout the Philippine diaspora in North America, Europe, Middle East and Asia. The church is the second-largest single Christian denomination in the country after the Roman Catholic Church (some 80.2% of the population), comprising about 6.7% of the total population of the Philippines. By contrast, the 2010 Philippine census recorded only 916,639 members in the country, or about 1% of the population. Some of the members of the church, like the founders Aglipay and De los Reyes, are political activists, often involved in progressive groups and advocating nationalism, anti-imperialism, democracy, as well as opposing extrajudicial killings. They have often been victims of forced disappearances and been branded as leftist by the government for being aligned with progressive groups, specifically after Obispo M√°ximo IX Alberto Ramento was killed in 2006 for being an anti-government critic Doctrine and practice =Priesthood= The Iglesia Filipina Independiente maintains the historic threefold ministry of bishops, priests, and deacons. Bishops of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente derive their apostolic succession from the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, which was first bestowed on April 7, 1948. The Iglesia Filipina Independiente ordains women. The Church allows its priests to marry, rejecting mandatory clerical celibacy. In May 2019 Emelyn Dacuycuy became the first woman to be ordained bishop in the Iglesia Filipina Independiente. =Worship and liturgy= The main Sunday liturgy is the Eucharist or the Holy Mass, which is said in the vernacular. The Eucharistic liturgy of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente resembles that of the Roman Missal, with elements taken from the Anglican Book of Common Prayer, such as the Collect for Purity, the positioning of the Peace before the Offertory, the Eucharistic Prayers, and the Prayer of Humble Access. Orders of service and ceremonies are contained in the Filipino Ritual and Filipino Missal. Aglipayans believe in the Real Presence of Christ in the Eucharist, and Communion is distributed under both kinds. Being a nationalist church, Aglipayans employ Filipino national symbols in their liturgical practices, such as the use of national colors and motifs, as well as the singing of the national anthem, and the displaying of the Philippine Flag in the sanctuary. =Contraception= Aglipayan bishops joined public demonstrations in support of the Reproductive Health Bill, a law advocating for contraception and sex education that the Catholic Church and several other Christian denominations objected to on moral grounds. =LGBT rights= The Philippine Independent Church has had a history of violence against members of the LGBT community. However, in the early 21st century, the church position changed dramatically to an extent where the church leadership apologized through an official statement to the LGBT community. The church recognized that it has \\"shown indifference, and have made the LGBT people feel less human, discriminated against and stigmatized\\". The statement ‚Äì dubbed \\"Our Common Humanity, Our Shared Dignity\\" ‚Äì stresses the church's position that it \\"must openly embrace God's people of all sexes, sexual orientations, gender identities and expressions\\". The apology statement's groundwork first came up in 2014, when a gay man articulated during the church plenary his query about the church's plans for sexual minorities. This led to discussions among the newly elected set of national youth officers, led by an openly gay president and a lesbian executive vice president, which would later be succeeded by another openly gay president. The church position on LGBT persons was officially adopted by the entire church in February 2017. Executive Commission The General Assembly is the highest governing body that meets every three years. The Executive Commission is mandated by the General Assembly to act on its behalf, when not in session, on matters ordinarily within its jurisdiction. The Executive Commission meets regularly during the ad interim period. The Obispo Maximo presides as ex-officio Chairperson of the Executive Commission. Other members include the Chairperson of the National Lay Council, as ex-officio vice-chairperson; the General Secretary, as ex- officio secretary; the chairpersons of the Commission on Programs and Projects and the Commission on Business and Finance; five bishops elected by the Supreme Council of Bishops, five priests elected by the Council of Priests; and the three presidents of the national sectoral organizations of the men, women and youth of the Church. Two other elected officers of the Church, the General Treasurer and General Auditor, are given permanent invitation by the Executive Commission to join during regular meetings. They are permitted to deliberate but not granted with the right to vote. * Obispo Maximo * General Secretary * General Treasurer * Auditor General * Chairperson, Supreme Council of Bishops [SCB] * Chairperson, Mindanao Bishops' Conference [MinBisCon] * Chairperson, North-Central Luzon Bishops Conference [NC-LBC] * Chairperson, South-Central Luzon Bishops Conference [SC-LBC] * Bishop, Visayas Bishops Conference [ViBisCon] * Bishop, USA and Canada Conference [Abroad (later North America) Conference] * Chairperson, Council of Priests * Governor General, National Priests Organization * Representative, COP Visayas * Representative, COP North-Central Luzon * Representative, COP Mindanao * Chairperson, National Lay Council * National President, Laymen of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente * National President, Women of the Philippine Independent Church * National President, Youth of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente * Chairperson, Commission on Business and Finance * Chairperson, Commission on Programs and Projects { class=\\"sites-layout-hbox\\"  } Organization The Church has 47 dioceses, including the Diocese of the Eastern and Western United States and Canada. However, a lack of priests means that many parishes in the United States must depend on lay leaders. The church is led by the Obispo M√°ximo or Supreme Bishop, similar to a presiding bishop in other denominations. The current Obispo M√°ximo is The Most Rev Rhee XIII Timbang y Millena, who was elected on May 14, 2017. The Supreme Council of Bishops (SCB) consists of all serving and retired bishops. Its main tasks include maintaining and defining doctrinal orthodoxy, the adoption and prescription of liturgy.and the overall pastoral and moral guidance to the faithful. There are also regional episcopal conferences, North Central Luzon Bishops Conference, South Central Luzon Bishops Conference, Visayas Bishops Conference, and Mindanao Bishops Conference. The Council of Priests (COP) is the group of delegates to the General Assembly that are entirely priests. It elects a chairperson, a vice- chairperson and a secretary that have each terms of three years. The Council of Priests promotes the welfare of the clergy and represents their concerns to the General Assembly. The National Lay Council is composed of the men, women and youth delegates of every diocese represented in the General Assembly. It works to promote and enhance the participation of the laity in the governance and general affairs of the Church. There are also several sectoral groups, such as the Women of the Philippine Independent Church (WOPIC), Youth of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (YIFI), and Laymen of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (LIFI). =General Assembly= The Iglesia Filipina Independiente has a strong tradition of authority belonging to the entire people of God. This conciliar nature of authority in the Church is expressed in the General Assembly where the clergy and laity are both represented. The Iglesia Filipina Independiente is a Church that is governed synodically. It has the General Assembly as the highest governing and policy-making body that regularly convenes every three years. It consists of all bishops, two priests in active duty, and three and three delegates representing the men, women, and youth from every diocese elected in a convention, as provided in Sections 1 and 2, Article II, of its Constitution. The General Assembly operates as a synod through which the ordained and non-ordained share the responsibility of witnessing to the apostolic faith by virtue of their common baptism. It serves as the governing body of the Church in fulfilling the mission entrusted by God, in safeguarding the unity and continuity of the apostolic faith, and in guiding the faithful in the fulfillment of their baptismal covenant. It is thus the final authority in all matters affecting the life, order and discipline of the Church. In the spirit of consultation, the General Assembly tackles complex and contentious issues and matters that touch on the institutional components of the Church that have to do with governance, policies, and programs. On the whole, the General Assembly: * receives the address of the Obispo Maximo * acts upon the decisions of the Executive Commission * receives report of the General Treasurer * receives reports of the Commission on Business and Finance (CBF) and the Commission on Programs and Projects (COPP) * receives reports of the Supreme Council of Bishops, Council of Priests and National Lay Council * approves the program of the Church * approve the triennial budget * elects the Executive Commission and the national officers of the Standing Commission =Commission= There are six commissions that promote the enduring concerns in the various aspects of the life of the Church, with each composed of people with expertise in the particular areas. The Commissions are primarily recommendatory in nature in terms of formulation of policies, which are subject to the final approval of the Executive Commission and the General Assembly of the Church. * Commission on Business and Finance * Commission on Programs and Projects * Commission on Education and Ministry * Commission on Liturgy and Music * Commission on Mission and Evangelism * Commission on Ecumenical Relations and International Affairs = Councils = The church has three important councils that are represented in the General Assembly. These are the Supreme Council of Bishops, the Council of Priests and the National Lay Council. These play important leadership roles in setting the direction of the church and in pursuing institutional development for the work of mission. * Supreme Council of Bishops The Supreme Council of Bishops (SCB), which consists of all serving and retired bishops, defines the doctrines of the Church, adopts and prescribes official liturgical rites, and gives pastoral and moral guidance to the faithful. * Council of Priests The Council of Priests is composed of all priest-delegates to the General Assembly. It elects a Chairperson, a Vice Chairperson and a Secretary for an office of three years. The Council of Priests promotes the welfare of priests and represents their concerns to the General Assembly. * National Lay Council The National Lay Council is composed of the men, women and youth delegates of every diocese represented in the General Assembly. It works to promote and enhance the participation of the laity in the governance and general affairs of the Church. = Lay organizations = Youth of Iglesia Filipina Independiente Logo There are three sectoral organizations of the laity in the Church. These are the Youth of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (YIFI), the Women of the Philippine Independent Church (WOPIC) and the Laymen of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente (LIFI). The sectoral organizations are each governed by their respective constitution and by-laws, have their own sets of elected officers, and are organized at the national, diocesan and parish levels. The youth, women, and men of the sectoral organizations are represented to the General Assembly through the National Lay Council.  Notable churches  Interior of the Cathedral of the Holy Child Owing to its roots in the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines, the church buildings of the Philippine Independent Church do not differ significantly from Catholic church buildings. Some of its notable churches are listed here. = Cathedral of the Holy Child (National Cathedral) = The Cathedral of the Holy Child in Ermita, Manila is the National Cathedral of the Philippine Independent Church, and the seat of the Obispo M√°ximo. Designed by architect Carlos Arguelles, construction of the church began in 1964 and was inaugurated on May 8, 1969, on the occasion of the 109th birth anniversary of its first Obispo M√°ximo, Gregorio Aglipay. The church is made largely of bare concrete and wood and has been noted for having a suspended block with sloping trapezoidal walls and textured with horizontal grooves all throughout, suspended with a triangular block. = Mar√≠a Clara Church = The Mar√≠a Clara Church in Santa Cruz, Manila, was originally built as a wooden structure in 1923 before it was expanded and becoming concrete structure in the 1950s. When the original cathedral of the Iglesia Filipina Independiente in Tondo was destroyed during World War II, the Mar√≠a Clara Church became the temporary office of the Obispo M√°ximo before relocating in 1969 to the present Cathedral of the Holy Child. It was the also home parish of the fourth Obispo M√°ximo, Isabelo de los Reyes, Jr., where he was ordained as a priest in 1923, and elected Supreme Bishop in 1946.

ACTS offers a Bachelor of Theology and Divinity Programs for those who aspire to enter the ordained ministry in the Church. It is a four-year study program with a curriculum focused on biblical, theological, historical and pastoral studies with reference to parish management and development and wider cultural and social context. St. Paul's Theological Seminary (SPTS) is the regional seminary of the church dedicated to serve the Visayas and Mindanao Dioceses. St. Andrew's Theological Seminary (SATS) is run by the Episcopal Church in the Philippines, but serves both that church and the Iglesia Filipina Independiente. St John the Divine School of Theology is soon to be established in Mindanao to cater strong demand of aspirants for the ordained ministry in Conference. Churches in full communion The church enjoys full communion with the Anglican Communion, and the churches of the Union of Utrecht - although it is not a formal member of either. By virtue of its concordat relations with the Anglican churches, the Philippine Independent Church is given the privilege to send delegates to the Council of Churches of East Asia (CCEA) as organized by the Anglican provinces in East Asia in 1962. Since 1964, IFI bishops have also been regular participants of the Lambeth Conferences. The IFI also has a concordat with the Church of Sweden. Relation with the Anglican realignment The Philippine Independent Church endorsed a concordat with the Anglican Church in North America, in January 2020, in a meeting held in Melbourne, Florida, which will be presented for approval at the ACNA's Provincial Council in June.College of Bishops Communiqu√©, ACNA Official Website, January 2020 Notable members Isabelo de los Reyes, Sr Felipe Buencamino *The Most Rev.

The company also produces Puffins cereal and Snackimals snacks through their Barbara's Bakery division. History :See History of Weet-Bix The food product was originally invented in Australia in the 1920s by Bennison Osborne. Osborne and his friend Malcolm MacFarlane successfully launched Weet-Bix in Australia and New Zealand under the sponsorship of the owner of Grain Products Ltd., who soon sold the Australasian rights to the Australasian Conference Association Limited Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company. Osborne and MacFarlane decided to expand into South Africa and while there, they began the establishment of the British & African Cereal Company, Ltd., a Private Company, to start a venture in England under the Companies, Act,1929, (Company No. 267687), where they became joint Managing Directors until MacFarlane left the Company in 1932/1933, after which Osborne became the sole managing director until 1936, when he left the Company for the United States of America. The first Directors of the Company were Bennison Osborne, Malcolm MacFarlane, Alfred Richard Upton and Arthur Stanley Scrutton. Frank George, who had offered them the use of a disused flour mill in Burton Latimer, Northamptonshire, subsequently requested and was granted shares in the Company and was offered a place on the Board. The company holds a Royal Warrant from Queen Elizabeth II. For the purpose of differentiating between the various countries, it was decided that the product, when introduced into the United Kingdom, should be known as \\"Weetabix\\". On 13 August 1936, with the approval of the Board of Trade, the Company name was changed to Weetabix Limited . Alpen was invented in 1971, when a company executive was on holiday in Switzerland and tasted a local delicacy. In November 2003, the company was bought from Weetabix Limited, by the American private equity firm HM Capital of Dallas. From 29 January 2004, it was owned by Lion Capital LLP, until 3 May 2012 when the Chinese company Bright Food bought a 60% controlling stake, valuing the company at ¬£1.2bn ($1.9bn). In 2012 the company was bought by the Chinese Government through the state-run Bright Food, and the equity firm Baring Private Equity Asia, with Bright Food having the controlling interest. In July 2017, the American company Post Holdings bought the company for ¬£1.4 billion. The company does not have the rights to the product in Australia, New Zealand or South Africa. In these countries, the brand is still known as Weet- Bix and is still made by Sanitarium Health Food Company. =Awards= It has won three Queen's Awards for Export, lastly in 2004. Company structure The company is headquartered in Burton Latimer, Kettering, Northamptonshire, England, and its site is next to the A14 junction with the A6. It also has factories in Corby and Ashton-under-Lyne. The company produces 3 billion Weetabix breakfast biscuits every year from its Kettering site. Weetabix is also one of the major manufacturers of generic cereals for the major supermarkets. Weetabix has factories in Europe, East Africa and North America. It is the largest producer of breakfast cereals in the UK. It exports to eighty countries. As of 2012 it employed around 2000 people.Financial Times 22 April, 2012 5:23 pm Lion Capital explores Weetabix sale Brands =Alpen= =Barbara's Bakery= The California-based natural-foods company was purchased by Weetabix in 1986, eventually moving operations to Marlborough, Massachusetts. They are particularly well known for their Puffins Cereal, whose box features a puffin defying the laws of gravity by standing sideways relative to a photo of cereal. In 2019-2020 the packaging for Barbara's Bakery cereals was revamped , and on the new packaging all references to \\"The Weetabix Company, Inc.\\" have been replaced with references to \\"Three Sisters Cereal\\". =Crunchy Bran= =GrainShop= Sold primarily in the North American market, the GrainShop brand has two cereals, High Fibre Crisp and Honey Almond Crunch. High Fibre Crisp is a blend of four grains, wheat and corn, bran and oats, while Honey Almond Crunch is a combination of crunchy oats, flakes, almonds and honey. =Oatibix= Products in the Oatibix range are made from oats, as opposed to the company's preference to wheat-based food. The original Oatibix cereal is physically very similar to the company's flagship Weetabix but made of whole grain oats. Oatibix Bitesize is a variant of Oatibix with smaller biscuits and is available as Oatibix Bitesize Sultana & Apple or Oatibix Bitesize Chocolate & Raisin in addition to the original flavour. =Oatibix Flakes= =Ready Brek= Ready Brek is an oat-based breakfast cereal that is intended to be served hot, and comes in three varieties; 'Original', 'Chocolate' and 'Seriously Oaty'. A butterscotch flavour was marketed during the 1970s. =Weetabix= Weetabix is a whole grain wheat breakfast cereal that comes in the form of palm-sized biscuits. It is Weetabix Food Company's flagship product, introduced in 1932 and is officially the top-selling breakfast cereal in the United Kingdom, accounting for 8% of the country's total cereal sales. The cereal, which is manufactured in facilities in Kettering, England and Canada, is exported to 80 countries and has annual sales worth over ¬£95 million. Weetabix Bitesize is essentially a smaller \\"bite-sized\\" version of Weetabix that can be easily poured into a bowl, more like a traditional breakfast cereal. Weetabix Minis are sweeter variant of the Weetabix Bitesize, with various additions depending upon the variety; Chocolate Crisp, Banana Crisp, Fruit & Nut Crisp, and Honey & Nut Crisp. Outside of the UK, Weetabix Minis has been re-launched and renamed at least twice in a relatively short period of time following their launch. Previously, they were known as Fruitibix, Bananabix, and Chocobix (depending upon the additions), then as Minibix. =Weetaflakes= =Weetos= Sponsorship Weetabix was the title sponsor of the Women's British Open between 1987 and 2006.

It has also been used in alcohol dependence. For epilepsy this includes treatment for generalized or focal seizures. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include tingling, loss of appetite, feeling tired, abdominal pain, hair loss, and trouble concentrating. Serious side effects may include suicide, increased ammonia levels resulting in encephalopathy, and kidney stones. Use in pregnancy may result in harm to the baby and use during breastfeeding is not recommended. How it works is unclear. Topiramate was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. A month supply in the United Kingdom costs the NHS about ¬£1.40 per month as of 2019. In the United States, the wholesale cost of this amount is about US$4.00. In 2017, it was the 77th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than ten million prescriptions. Medical uses A package of topiramate 25mg from Norway Topiramate is used to treat epilepsy in children and adults, and it was originally used as an anticonvulsant. In children, it is indicated for the treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a disorder that causes seizures and developmental delay. It is most frequently prescribed for the prevention of migraines as it decreases the frequency of attacks. Topirimate is used to treat medication overuse headache and is recommended by the European Federation of Neurological Societies as one of the few medications showing effectiveness for this indication. =Pain= A 2018 review found topiramate of no use in chronic low back pain. Topiramate has not been shown to work as a pain medicine in diabetic neuropathy, the only neuropathic condition in which it has been adequately tested. =Other= One common off-label use for topiramate is in the treatment of bipolar disorder. A review published in 2010 suggested a benefit of topiramate in the treatment of symptoms of borderline personality disorder, however the authors noted that this was based only on one randomized controlled trial and requires replication. Topiramate has been used as a treatment for alcoholism. The VA/DoD 2015 guideline on substance use disorders lists topiramate as a \\"strong for\\" in its recommendations for alcohol use disorder. Other uses include treatment of obesity and antipsychotic-induced weight gain. It is being studied to treat post traumatic stress disorder. In 2012, the combination phentermine/topiramate was approved in the United States for weight loss. Adverse effects People taking topiramate should be aware of the following risks: *Avoid activities requiring mental alertness and coordination until drug effects are realized. *Topiramate may impair heat regulation, especially in children. Use caution with activities leading to an increased core temperature, such as strenuous exercise, exposure to extreme heat, or dehydration. *Topiramate may cause visual field defects. *Topiramate may decrease effectiveness of oestrogen- containing oral contraceptives. *Taking topiramate in the first trimester of pregnancy may increase risk of cleft lip/cleft palate in infant. *As is the case for all antiepileptic drugs, it is advisable not to suddenly discontinue topiramate as there is a theoretical risk of rebound seizures. =Frequency= Adverse effects by incidence: Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects include: Uncommon (1-10% incidence) adverse effects include: * Weight gain * Anaemia * Disturbance in attention * Memory impairment * Amnesia * Cognitive disorder * Mental impairment * Psychomotor skills impaired * Convulsion * Coordination abnormal * Tremor * Lethargy * Hypoaesthesia (reduced sense of touch) * Nystagmus * Dysgeusia * Balance disorder * Dysarthria * Intention tremor * Sedation * Blurred vision * Diplopia (double vision) * Visual disturbance * Vertigo * Tinnitus * Ear pain * Dyspnoea * Epistaxis * Nasal congestion * Rhinorrhoea * Vomiting * Constipation * Abdominal pain upper * Dyspepsia * Abdominal pain * Dry mouth * Stomach discomfort * Paraesthesia oral * Gastritis * Abdominal discomfort * Nephrolithiasis * Pollakisuria * Dysuria * Alopecia (hair loss) * Rash * Pruritus * Arthralgia * Muscle spasms * Myalgia * Muscle twitching * Muscular weakness * Musculoskeletal chest pain * Decreased appetite * Pyrexia * Asthenia * Irritability * Gait disturbance * Feeling abnormal * Malaise * Hypersensitivity * Bradyphrenia (slowness of thought) * Insomnia * Expressive language disorder * Anxiety * Confusional state * Disorientation * Aggression * Mood altered * Agitation * Mood swings * Anger * Abnormal behaviour Rarely, the inhibition of carbonic anhydrase may be strong enough to cause metabolic acidosis of clinical importance. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has notified prescribers that topiramate can cause acute myopia and secondary angle closure glaucoma in a small subset of people who take topiramate regularly. The symptoms, which typically begin in the first month of use, include blurred vision and eye pain. Discontinuation of topiramate may halt the progression of the ocular damage and may reverse the visual impairment. Preliminary data suggests that, as with several other anti-epileptic drugs, topiramate carries an increased risk of congenital malformations. This might be particularly important for women who take topiramate to prevent migraine attacks. In March 2011, the FDA notified healthcare professionals and patients of an increased risk of development of cleft lip and/or cleft palate (oral clefts) in infants born to women treated with Topamax (topiramate) during pregnancy and placed it in Pregnancy Category D. Topiramate has been associated with a statistically significant increase in suicidality, and \\"suicidal thoughts or actions\\" is now listed as one of the possible side effects of the drug \\"in a very small number of people, about 1 in 500.\\" Overdose Symptoms of acute and acute on chronic exposure to topiramate range from asymptomatic to status epilepticus, including in patients with no seizure history. In children, overdose may also result in hallucinations. Topiramate has been deemed the primary substance that led to fatal overdoses in cases that were complicated by polydrug exposure. The most common signs of overdose are dilated pupils, somnolence, dizziness, psychomotor agitation, and abnormal, uncoordinated body movements. Symptoms of overdose may include but are not limited to: A specific antidote is not available. Treatment is entirely supportive. Interactions Topiramate has many drug-drug interactions. Some of the most common are listed below: * As topiramate inhibits carbonic anhydrase, use with other inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase (e.g. acetazolamide) increases the risk of kidney stones. * Enzyme inducers (e.g. carbamazepine) can increase the elimination of topiramate, possibly necessitating dose escalations of topiramate. * Topiramate may increase the plasma-levels of phenytoin. * Topiramate itself is a weak inhibitor of CYP2C19 and induces CYP3A4; a decrease in plasma levels of estrogens and digoxin has been noted during topiramate therapy. This can reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives (birth control pills); use of alternative birth control methods is recommended. Neither intrauterine devices (IUDs) nor Depo-Provera are affected by topiramate. * Alcohol may cause increased sedation or drowsiness, and increase the risk of having a seizure. * As topiramate may result in acidosis other treatments that also do so may worsen this effect.FDA.gov * Oligohidrosis and hyperthermia were reported in post-marketing reports about topiramate; antimuscarinic drugs (like trospium) can aggravate these disorders. Pharmacology Chemically, topiramate is a sulfamate modified fructose diacetonide - a rather unusual chemical structure for a pharmaceutical. Topiramate is quickly absorbed after oral use. Most of the drug (70%) is excreted in the urine unchanged. The remainder is extensively metabolized by hydroxylation, hydrolysis, and glucuronidation. Six metabolites have been identified in humans, none of which constitutes more than 5% of an administered dose. Several cellular targets have been proposed to be relevant to the therapeutic activity of topiramate. These include (1) voltage-gated sodium channels; (2) high-voltage-activated calcium channels; (3) GABA-A receptors; (4) AMPA/kainate receptors; and (5) carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes. There is evidence that topiramate may alter the activity of its targets by modifying their phosphorylation state instead of by a direct action. The effect on sodium channels could be of particular relevance for seizure protection. Although topiramate does inhibit high-voltage-activated calcium channels, the relevance to clinical activity is uncertain. Effects on specific GABA-A receptor isoforms could also contribute to the antiseizure activity of the drug. Topiramate selectively inhibits cytosolic (type II) and membrane associated (type IV) forms of carbonic anhydrase. The action on carbonic anhydrase isoenzymes may contribute to the drug's side-effects, including its propensity to cause metabolic acidosis and calcium phosphate kidney stones. Topiramate inhibits maximal electroshock and pentylenetetrazol- induced seizures as well as partial and secondarily generalized tonic-clonic seizures in the kindling model, findings predictive of a broad spectrum of activities clinically. Its action on mitochondrial permeability transition pores has been proposed as a mechanism. While many anticonvulsants have been associated with apoptosis in young animals, animal experiments have found that topiramate is one of the very few anticonvulsants [see: levetiracetam, carbamazepine, lamotrigine] that do not induce apoptosis in young animals at doses needed to produce an anticonvulsant effect. =Detection in body fluids= Blood, serum, or plasma topiramate concentrations may be measured using immunoassay or chromatographic methods to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation. Plasma levels are usually less than 10 mg/L during therapeutic administration, but can range from 10‚Äì150 mg/L in overdose victims.Goswami D, Kumar A, Khuroo AH, et al.

Baselt, Disposition of Toxic Drugs and Chemicals in Man, 8th edition, Biomedical Publications, Foster City, CA, 2008, pp. 1567-1569. History Topiramate was discovered in 1979 by Bruce E. Maryanoff and Joseph F. Gardocki during their research work at McNeil Pharmaceuticals. The commercial usage of Topiramate began in 1996. Mylan Pharmaceuticals was granted final approval by the FDA for the sale of generic topiramate in the United States and the generic version was made available in September 2006. The last patent for topiramate in the U.S. was for use in children and expired on February 28, 2009.

He was educated in ≈Å√≥d≈∫ and in Warsaw where he studied law and philosophy at Warsaw University. After Poland's return to independence in 1918, Tuwim co-founded the Skamander group of experimental poets with Antoni S≈Çonimski and Jaros≈Çaw Iwaszkiewicz. He was a major figure in Polish literature, admired also for his contribution to children's literature. He was a recipient of the prestigious Golden Laurel of the Polish Academy of Literature in 1935. Julian Tuwim (1894-1953), Qlturka.pl. Europejski Fundusz Rozwoju Regionalnego. Retrieved December 12, 2011. Life and work Tuwim was born into a family of assimilated Jews. The surname comes from the Hebrew tovim () meaning \\"good ones\\". His parents, Izydor and Adela, provided Julian with a comfortable middle class upbringing. He was not a particularly diligent student and had to repeat the sixth grade. In 1905 the family had to flee from ≈Å√≥d≈∫ to Wroc≈Çaw (Breslau) in order to escape possible repercussions following Izydor's involvement in the Revolution of 1905. Initially Tuwim's poetry, even more than that of the other \\"Skamandrites\\", represented a decisive break with turn-of-the-20th-century mannerism. It was characterized by an expression of vitality, optimism, in praise of urban life. His poems celebrated everyday life in the city, with its triviality and vulgarity. Tuwim often used vernacular language in his work, along with slang as well as poetic dialogue. Witkacy. His collections \\"Czyhanie na Boga\\" (In Lurking for God (1918)), \\"Sokrates ta≈ÑczƒÖcy\\" (Dancing Socrates (1920)), \\"Si√≥dma jesie≈Ñ\\" (Seventh Autumn (1922)), and \\"Wierszy tom czwarty\\" (Poems, Volume Four (1923)) are typical of his early work. In his later collections ‚Äî \\"S≈Çowa we krwi\\" (Words in the Blood, 1926)), \\"Rzecz Czarnoleska\\" (The Czarnolas affair) (1929), \\"Biblia cyga≈Ñska\\" (The Gypsy Bible (1933)) and \\"Tre≈õƒá gorejƒÖca\\" (A Burning Matter (1933)) Tuwim became restless and bitter, and wrote with fervour and vehemence about the emptiness of urban existence. He also drew more heavily from the romantic and classicist traditions, while perfecting his form and style, and becoming a virtuoso wordsmith. Julian Tuwim Monument by sculptor Wojciech Gryniewicz From the very beginning and throughout his artistic career, Tuwim was satirically inclined. He supplied sketches and monologues to numerous cabarets. In his poetry and articles, he derided obscurantism and bureaucracy as well as militaristic and nationalistic trends in politics. His burlesque, \\"Bal w Operze\\" (The Ball at the Opera, 1936) is regarded as his best satirical poem. In 1918 Tuwim co-founded the cabaret, \\"Picador\\", and worked as a writer or artistic director with many other cabarets such as \\"Czarny kot\\" (Black Cat 1917‚Äì1919), \\"Quid pro Quo\\" (1919‚Äì1932), \\"Banda\\" The Gang and \\"Stara Banda\\" The Old Gang (1932‚Äì1935) and finally \\"Cyrulik Warszawski\\" (Barber of Warsaw 1935‚Äì1939). Since 1924 Tuwim was a staff writer at \\"Wiadomo≈õci Literackie\\" (Literary News) where he wrote a weekly column, \\"Camera Obscura\\". He also wrote for the satirical magazine, \\"Szpilki\\" (Pins). Tuwim displayed his caustic sense of humour and unyielding individuality in works such as \\"Poem in which the author politely but firmly implores the vast hosts of his brethren to kiss his arse.\\" Here, Tuwim systematically enumerates and caricatures various personalities of the European social scene of the mid-1930s -- 'perfumed caf√© intellectuals', 'drab socialists', 'fascist jocks', 'Zionist doctors', 'repressed Catholics' and so on, and ends every stanza by asking each to perform the action indicated in the title. The poem ends with a note to the would-be censor who would surely be tempted to expunge all mention of this piece for its breach of 'public standards.' His poem \\"Do prostego cz≈Çowieka\\" (To the Common Man), first published on October 7, 1929 in \\"Robotnik\\" (Workman), provoked a storm of personal attacks on Tuwim, mostly from anti-Semitic right wing circles criticizing Tuwim's pacifist views. Julian's aunt was married to Adam Czerniak√≥w, and his uncle from his mother's side was Arthur Rubinstein. World War II and after In 1939, at the beginning of World War II and the Nazi occupation of Poland, Tuwim emigrated through Romania first to France, and after France's capitulation, to Brazil, by way of Portugal, and finally to the US, where he settled in 1942. In 1939-41 he collaborated with the √©migr√© weekly \\"Wiadomosci Polskie\\", but broke off the collaboration due to differences in views on the attitude towards the Soviet Union. In 1942-46 he worked with the monthly \\"Nowa Polska\\" published in London, and with leftist Polish-American newspapers. He was affiliated with the Polish section of the International Workers Organization from 1942. He was also a member of the Association of Writers From Poland (a member of the board in 1943). Tuwim's grave in Warsaw's PowƒÖzki Cemetery. Tuwim St. in Chrzan√≥w During this time he wrote \\"Kwiaty Polskie\\" (Polish Flowers), an epic poem in which he remembers with nostalgia his early childhood in ≈Å√≥d≈∫. In April 1944 he published a manifesto, entitled \\"My, ≈ªydzi Polscy\\" (We, Polish Jews). Tuwim returned to Poland after the war in 1946, but did not produce much in Stalinist Poland. He died in 1953 at the age of 59 in Zakopane. Although Tuwim was well known for serious poetry he also wrote satirical works and poetry for children, for example \\"Lokomotywa\\" (The Locomotive) (1938, tr. 1940) translated into many languages.\\"Locomotive\\" poem, French. He also wrote well-regarded translations of Pushkin and other Russian poets. Russian Soviet poet Yelizaveta Tarakhovskaya translated most of Tuwim's children's poetry into Russian.

The town is located in the northeast of the state, about south of the resort city of Canc√∫n, and about north of the city of Playa del Carmen. Puerto Morelos merged with the village of Leona Vicario on December 6, 2015, to become the 11th municipality in Quintana Roo, separating from its former municipality of Benito Juarez. History It has historically been the main port between the mainland of Yucat√°n and the Island of Cozumel, and an automobile ferry used to run from Puerto Morelos to Cozumel. The town is named after Independence leader Jos√© Mar√≠a Morelos. Resorts are abundant in the Puerto Morelos region along the Riviera Maya and attractions, such as the Crococun Crocodile Zoo, the Botanical Garden, and a host of cenotes are also increasing in number. Recently new smaller inns have been built which offers an evening programs of Talks on local history, marine biology, and healthy living practices. One hundred meters off shore lies the Puerto Morelos portion of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System, designated as a National Marine Park in 1998 due to local environmental activists. Geography Puerto Morelos is divided by a highway and a mangrove swamp into three sections. The section west of the highway is known as \\"Colonia Joaquin Zetina Gazca\\". The section east of the highway is called \\"Colonia Pescadores\\". The section on the coast east of the mangrove swamp is \\"Puerto\\" or \\"Antiguo (old) Puerto Morelos\\". This original coastal fishing village is now a quiet, mixed-use neighborhood of private homes, hotels, condominiums, restaurants, and tourist shops. The second part is about 2 km. inland and adjacent to Highway 307, on the western side. The inland portion is mainly single level dwellings for local workers. New residential developments have sprung up in recent years adding to the housing mix. There are now multi-story apartment buildings, and private residential developments between the highway and the mangrove where one can buy lots and build a house of one's own design. =Climate= Classified by K√∂ppen-Geiger system as tropical wet and dry climate (Aw), because its driest month has less than of precipitation and also less than 100 ‚àí (total annual precipitation [mm]/25), also because each month has a mean average above .

P. 3 On November 1, 2004 a book titled Puerto Rico: Grand Cuisine of the Caribbean, was released in Spanish and English. The cookbook is a dedication to Puerto Rico's rich gastronomic and chefs sharing old and new recipes. The book features not only native Puerto Rican chefs but chefs from all over who have been influenced by Puerto Rico's cuisine calling it \\"the gastronomic capital of the Caribbean\\". =Taino influences in Puerto Rican cuisine= See: Native American cuisine Marinated cassava () From the diet of the Ta√≠no (culturally related with the Maya and Carib peoples of Central America and the Caribbean) and Arawak people come many tropical roots and tubers (collectively called viandas) like yuat√≠a (Xanthosoma) and especially Yuca (cassava), from which thin cracker-like casabe bread is made and pasteles Puerto Rico's version of tamale. Ajicito or cachucha pepper, a very mild chili known for it smokeyness, recao/culantro (spiny leaf coriander), sarsaparilla, avocado, pimienta (allspice), achiote (annatto), peppers, aj√≠ caballero (the hottest pepper native to Puerto Rico), peanuts, guavas, pineapples, jicacos (cocoplum), quenepas (mamoncillo), lerenes (Guinea arrowroot), calabazas (West Indian pumpkin), and guanabanas (soursops) are all Ta√≠no foods. The Ta√≠nos also grew varieties of beans and some ma√≠z (corn/maize), but ma√≠z was not as dominant in their cooking as it was for the peoples on the mainland of Mesoamerica. This is due to the frequent hurricanes that Puerto Rico experiences, which destroy crops of ma√≠z, allowing more safeguarded plants like yuca conucos (hills of yuca grown together) to flourish. Ma√≠z when used was frequently made into cornmeal and then into guanime, cornmeal mixed with mashed yaut√≠a and yuca and wrapped in corn husk or large leaves. Food was cooked on a barbecue grill made of logs over a pit of flame. To the Ta√≠nos this was known as barbacoa. Cilantro leaves =Spanish/European influence= See: Spanish cuisine Spanish/European influence is also prominent in Puerto Rican cuisine. Wheat, chickpeas (garbanzos), black pepper, onions, garlic, cilantro (using plant and seeds in cooking), basil, sugarcane, citrus fruit, grapes, eggplant, lard, chicken, beef, pork, lamb, goat and dairy all came to Borik√©n (Puerto Rico's native Taino name) from Spain. Olives, capers, and olive oil play a big part in Puerto Rican cooking, but cannot be grown under the tropical climate of the island. The island imported most of these foods from Spain along with some herbs. Early Dutch, French, Italian, and Chinese immigrants influenced not only the culture but Puerto Rican cooking as well. This great variety of traditions came together to form La Cocina Criolla. Plantain \\"ara√±itas\\" and \\"tostones rellenos\\" =African influence= See: African cuisine Coconuts, coffee (brought by the Arabs and Corsos to Yauco from Kafa, Ethiopia), or√©gano brujo, okra, tamarind, yams, sesame seeds, gandules (pigeon peas in English), many varieties of banana fruit, other root vegetables and Guinea hen, all came to Puerto Rico from, or at least through, Africa. African slaves also introduced the deep-frying of food, such as cuchifritos. =United States influence= See: Cuisine of the United States The US influence on the way Puerto Ricans cook their meals came about after Puerto Rico became a territory of the United States as a result of the Treaty of Paris of 1898. The most significant influence has to do with how people fry food. The early Spaniards brought olive oil for cooking and frying, but importing it from Spain made it very expensive, and cooks on the island shifted over to lard, which could be produced locally. For 50 to 60 years, corn oil produced in the United States took the place of lard for making cuchifritos. Galletas de soda (soda crackers in tins, popularly known as export sodas from a popular brand name) are a U.S. product of the 19th and early 20th centuries that reproduce the crunchy texture of the earlier casabe bread, and can be kept crunchy in the tins in high tropical humidity. American / streaky bacon has also played a big part in Puerto Rican cuisine. It is used in rice, stewed beans, and to stuff mofongo and meats such as whole chicken and the breast. Bacon in Puerto Rico has found its way into traditional foods such as arroz con gandules and potato salad. Another meat that has found its way onto the Puerto Rican table from the U.S. is turkey (pavo), which is not native to the island but a common holiday meal next to the older lech√≥n, roasted whole and seasoned using either saz√≥n or adobo, often served with a side of blood sausage and ripe plantains. =Latin American influence= See: Latin American cuisine Parcha, Puerto Rican name for Passiflora edulis, passion fruit. Other foods native to Latin America were brought to the island with the Spanish trade, such as cocoa, tomatoes, chayote, papaya, bell peppers and vanilla from Mexico and Central America. Potatoes and passion fruit were also brought over by the Spanish or Portuguese from Peru and Brazil. =Other influence= Mofongo en Puerto Rico Panap√©n (breadfruit) was first imported into the British Caribbean colonies from the South Pacific as cheap slave food in the late 18th century. After spreading throughout the Antilles, panap√©n has also become an indispensable part of the Puerto Rican repertoire, in puddings, deep-fried tostones and making mofongo. Regional The topography of the main island is divided into three major regions: the mountainous region, which includes the Cordillera Central, Sierra de Luquillo, Sierra de Cayey and Sierra Bermeja, the coastal plains and the northern karst region. Every regional and municipality has its unique gastronomic traditions. =Arecibo= Arecibo is the biggest municipality in Puerto Rico by an area and is located on the northern coast. Arecibo is known for its heavy use of cumin and coriander seeds making dishes smokey and flavorful. In the river of R√≠o Grande de Arecibo whitebait called cet√≠ is caught. These small fish are used in mofongo, alcapurrias, empanadas, but more famously battered and deep fried. One restaurant in Arecibo is known for a pastele filled with cet√≠. These pasteles are made of yuca, yaut√≠a, squash and coconut milk, wrapped in banana leaf and grilled. =Hatillo= The town of Hatillo is located on the north coast, about an hour west of San Juan. It is called the Dairy Capital of Puerto Rico, with almost as many cows as people. The town produces about one third of the milk consumed in Puerto Rico. Hatillo is the only place in the Caribbean to produce cheese equivalent to European cheese. Every cheese is name after a part in Puerto Rico or honor a destination in Puerto Rico. These cheeses are unique to Puerto Rico and can only be made in Hatillo, Puerto Rico. =Lo√≠za= Lo√≠za is a town and municipality on the northeastern coast of Puerto Rico. The town is known for its African traditions and was the center for African slave trade in Puerto Rico. Its Afro-Puerto Rican cuisine has a unique Ta√≠no touch and technique. The use of coconut is heavily used in sweet and savory dishes: empanadas made from yuca dough, coconut milk and filled with seafood; yellow rice with coconut and seafood; green papaya salad a rare find and a tradition that is dying out. The papaya is picked green and boiled. Whatever greens are available are tossed with the papaya, lemon or lime. Sweet plantains and the some of the papaya seeds are sometimes incorporated. There are also sweets such as dulce de coco (sweet milk coconut), cazuela (a sweet potato, pumpkin and raisin pie cooked with coconut milk and banana leaves), and dulce de ajonjoli (a sesame brittle, sometimes with almonds and coconut). Pasteles, rice and coconut arepas, toasted cornmeal arepas, yuca bread with garlic and coconut or cheese, mofongo and guanime are some of the most popular dishes coming from Lo√≠za. The cuisine of Lo√≠za has influenced not only all of Puerto Rico but throughout the Caribbean.

Only a tiny number of fishermen ply the waters off Puerto Rico today, and their catch never leaves their seacoast towns. The fact that the island sits next to the deepest part of the Atlantic means there is no wide continental shelf to foster a rich offshore fishery; neither are there any large rivers to dump extra nutrients into the sea that could build up a fish population. Snapper at Marisqueria Jibara Restaurant in San Sebastian in northwestern Puerto Rico =Fruits= Fresh tropical fruit is important in the traditional daily diet in Puerto Rico Acerola cherry Green and red cubanelle peppers are used to make sofr√≠to Cachucha or better known as Aj√≠ Dulce; Habanero chili pepper's mild cousin.

Mofongo is the best-known plantain dish and essential eating, at least once. The ripe version of the plantain is often fried and eaten as a side dish (maduros). *Dwarf Puerto Rican plantain ‚Äì The heads of fruit are a little larger than the original Plantain bearing seven to nine hands of fruit. The shorter trunks of the dwarf plantains are thicker than the tall ones and because of this are more resistant to the wind and rarely fall over from the weight of their own fruit. It is widely grown in Puerto Rico for its taste and cooking qualities. The majority of plantains grow tall, but this one is an exception. It has a distinctive bronze colored trunk and leaves. Plant in a warm and well- protected site with optimal growing conditions. *Dwarf Red ‚Äì One of many red- skinned banana cultivars on the island, however this one stays short and takes up little space.

The red bananas take longer to ripen than most, it will take up to 24 months to fruit. The banana has a very distinct, robust flavor that makes it well worth the wait. This red banana's skin turns sunset colors through the ripening process from yellow-green to orange then to red. The skin should be almost very dark red before it is ripe enough to eat. =Hot sauce= A traditional pique (hot sauce) is an oil and vinegar based sauce that is infused with whole peppers, garlic, onions and maybe culantro or other spices.

Made with boiled or grilled tomatoes and sweet plantains then fermented in vinegar, spices, garlic, onion, bay leaves, ginger, chilies and lemon juice. =Condiments= Puerto Rican cooking has a large range of spices and seasoning due mostly to influence, this makes Puerto Rico one of the best in Latin fusion cooking. Caribbean and other curries can be found but not as common as saz√≥n and adobo. Traditional cooking on the island uses more fresh and local ingredients such as citrus to make mojo and mojito isle√±o and especially fresh herbs, vegetables and peppers to make reca√≠to and sofrito. Star anise, ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg and other sweet spices are mainly used for drinks and desserts. Puerto Rican dishes are well seasoned with combinations of flavorful spices. The base of many Puerto Rican main dishes involves sofrito, similar to the mirepoix of French cooking, or the \\"trinity\\" of Creole cooking. A proper sofrito is a saut√© of freshly ground garlic, tomatoes, onions, recao/culantro, cilantro, red peppers, cachucha and cubanelle peppers. Sofrito is traditionally cooked with olive oil or annatto oil, tocino (bacon), salted pork and cured ham. A mix of stuffed olives and capers called alcaparrado are usually added with spices such as bay leaf, saz√≥n and adobo. *Aceite de achiote ‚Äì Annatto (bixa orellana) oil. Annatto seeds are cooked on a low flame with oil of choice or lard. Once oil is tinted red with a slight yellow and orange color pods are then discarded. The oil is refrigerated up to two months. Annatto oil is used in most Puerto Rican dishes. *Adobo mojado ‚Äì Garlic, salt, black pepper, olive oil, or√©gano brujo, vinegar or citrus juice or both. *Adobo seco ‚Äì Garlic powder, onion powder, dry or√©gano brujo, salt, black pepper, and sometimes dried citrus zest. *Ajilim√≥jili ‚Äì A very garlicky hot and spicy salsa. *Alcaparrado ‚Äì A mix of green olives, peppers, and capers. *Allspice ‚Äì This berry spice is native to the Caribbean. Allspice is not used regularly in Puerto Rican cuisine but can be seen in some African influenced dishes. The berry is used more in Puerto Rican voodoo than food. *Banana and plantain leaves ‚Äì Both leaves are used for their aroma, flavor, and bonding food. Pasteles, guanimes, steamed or grilled fish, and pork shoulder are a few dishes on the island where banana or plantain leaves are used. *Criollo ‚Äì Puerto Rican creole sauce, closely related to American creole sauce. Every part of the Caribbean has their unique take on creole sauce. Throughout Puerto Rico, salsa criollo is done differently. A basic Puerto Rican criollo has reca√≠to as a base. The reca√≠to is typically cooked with pork, spices, tomato sauce and some kind of liquid. *Mojito isle√±o ‚Äì A sauce served with fish or shellfish. *Mojo criollo ‚Äì A herb sauce of finely chopped cilantro or parsley with garlic, citrus, vinegar and olive oil.

Puerto Rican dishes Although Puerto Rican diets can vary greatly from day to day and residents tend to indulge in a variety of cuisines, there are some markedly similar patterns to daily meals. Commonly breakfast is simple and small, consisting of coffee and a pastry such as quesitos, a flaky puff pastry filled with a sweet cheese. Dinners almost invariably include a meat, rice and beans. This typical dinner structure leaves room for a plethora of options with choices of meat and rice preparation varying greatly. Traditionally, Puerto Ricans indulge in a wide array of nationalistic dishes as described below. =National dishes= *Arroz con dulce ‚Äì Sweet sticky rice cooked in spices, ginger, milk, coconut milk, raisins, and rum. National Christmas dessert. *Arroz con gandules y lech√≥n ‚Äì Yellow rice with pigeon peas alongside roasted pork is the national dish. *Asopao ‚Äì Similar to gumbo, the soup is made with rice, shellfish, chicken, chorizo and other ingredients. *Coquito ‚Äì Coconut milk and rum eggnog.

It has been the national beverage of Puerto Rico since 1978. *Tembleque ‚Äì Coconut corn starch pudding is the national dessert. =Holy Week dishes= During Holy Week before and during Easter, people are encouraged to think more about spiritual matters and eat lightly. Rather than eat meat, they prepare dishes with fish, eggs and dairy. *Bacalao a la Vizca√≠na ‚Äì Salted cod fish stew. The stew is thicker than guisadas but enough liquid to coat rice. The cod is cooked with water and milk, potatoes, raisins, olives, peppers, onions, garlic, tomato sauce, bay leaves and or√©gano. *Beverages ‚Äì Drinks are milk and fruit based. Pi√±a coladas are popular with added evaporated milk and no alcohol. Creamy guava made with sugar, vanilla, lime peels, and evaporated milk are the most consume on holy week. Ripe bananas blended with milk, cinnamon, vanilla, and sugar is prepared at homes as well. *Caldo Santo ‚Äì A soup prepared on Easter made with salted cod fish, shrimp, red snapper, crab, coconut milk and viandas. *Guanimes Con Bacalao ‚Äì Cornmeal, coconut, and plantain wrapped in plantain leaves and served with salted cod fish stew. *Habichuelas guisadas y viandas ‚Äì Stew red beans cooked with reca√≠to, tomato sauce, olives, spices, carrots, squash, sweet potato, and yams. *Serenata de Bacalao ‚Äì Salted cod fish salad. Shredded cod is tossed with dressing, cabbage, avocado, hard boil eggs, onions and a variety of boiled viandas. *Dulce ‚Äì Most sweets include cheese and fruit on holy week. Arroz con dulce y queso - sweet rice pudding with cream cheese is becoming more recognized every year, Quesito - a puff pastry filled with cream cheese and fruit, Flan de queso y fruta - flan made with cream cheese and fruit. =Thanksgiving dishes= When Thanksgiving was first celebrated, Puerto Rico was not a part of the United States and did not recognize the holiday. After officially becoming a commonwealth, Thanksgiving was eagerly accepted by the people as their own and has become one of the most celebrated vacations (holidays) of the year. As many regions of the Continental United States have, they've also put their own twist on this classic American tradition. Most American dishes have been adopted for this special day. Side dishes such as cornbread, roasted yams, mashed potatoes with gravy, hard apple cider, and cranberry sauce are a part of a Puerto Rican Thanksgiving menu. *Arroz con Maiz y Salchichas ‚Äì Yellow-rice with corn and Vienna sausage. *Coquito ‚Äì Coconut egg-nog rum. A Thanksgiving variation of this traditional Christmas drink can be made by adding pumpkin or chocolate flavor. *Gandules en Escabeche ‚Äì Green pigeon peas pickled in vinegar, lemon, olive oil, shallots, herbs, spices, capers, hot and sweet peppers. *Pasteles ‚Äì In most Puerto Rican homes, the gathering for pastel making happens a week or two before Thanksgiving. Pasteles are not only prepared for Thanksgiving but enough are made to last until New Year's, making this a timely process that is a cherished social gathering for families. Pork is the most popular pastel for both Thanksgiving and Christmas, but some make \\"Thanksgiving pasteles\\" with turkey and dried cranberries. *Pavochon ‚Äì Popular from November to January. Roasting a turkey for Thanksgiving in the manner of lech√≤n (suckling pig) has been a tradition in Puerto Rico since the island became an American commonwealth and adopted the holiday. The word pavoch√≤n is a combination of the Spanish word pavo (turkey), and the word lech√≤n. To make this dish truly Puerto Rican, the turkey is stuffed with mofongo with added almonds, raisins, olives, hard boiled eggs, and tomatoes. Instead of the thin slices seen in the North, a baked turkey in Puerto Rico is often cut into large blocks or chunks to be served on a plate. *Dulce ‚Äì The fusion of American mainland and Puerto Rican food can be clearly seen in Thanksgiving desserts. Puerto Rican desserts use the same traditional ingredients as American holiday desserts including pumpkin, yams, and sweet potatoes. Classic sweets are infused with sweet viandas. Flan de calabasas (squash flan), Tortitas de Calabaza (pumpkin tarts), Cazuela (a pie made with pumpkin, sweet potato, coconut, and sometimes carrots), Barriguitas de Vieja (deep-fried sweet pumpkin fritters made with coconut milk and spices), Cheese cake with tropical fruit, Bu√±uelos de Calabasas o plat√°no (pumpkin or sweet plantains doughnuts), and Bud√≠n de Pan y calabasas (bread pudding made from squash bread). =Christmas dishes= Puerto Rican culture can be seen and felt all year-round, but it is on its greatest display during Christmas when people celebrate the traditional aguinaldo and parrandas ‚Äì Puerto Rico's version of carol singing. Puerto Ricans celebrate what is probably the world's longest Christmas. The festivities get underway on 23 November and last until the end of January when the Fiestas de la Calle San Sebasti√°n take place. Puerto Rican food is a main part of this celebration. Christmas expresses the best flavors of Puerto Rico with staple foods, textures, and tradition. Christmas food in Puerto Rico is meant to accommodate every palate. Arroz con Gandules Pasteles *Arroz con gandules ‚Äì Yellow-rice-and-pigeon-pea dish. Sofr√≠to and annatto oil plays the biggest part in flavoring and coloring rice.

The holiday season is also a time that many pi√±as coladas are prepared, underscoring the combination of pineapples and coconuts seen in Puerto Rican cuisine. Beer is popular and Puerto Rican style rum punch with sparkling wine and fruit. *Chulet√≥n ‚Äì Christmas soup. A variety of beans cooked with sofr√≠to, saz√≥n, pork chops, pork bones, ham, smoked ham hock, salchich√≥n, potatoes, and carrots. This soup is served on Christmas with bread and is not part or the Nochebuena (the good night) festival. *Escabeche de Guineo con Mollejas ‚Äì Unripe, green bananas and chicken gizzards pickled in a garlicky brine. *Pasteles ‚Äì For many Puerto Rican families, the quintessential holiday season dish is pasteles (\\"pies\\"), usually not a sweet pastry or cake, but a soft dough-like mass wrapped in a banana or plantain leaf and boiled, and in the center chopped meat, shellfish, chicken, raisins, spices, capers, olives, sofrito, and often garbanzo beans. Puerto Rican pasteles are made from either green bananas or starchy tropical roots. The wrapper in a Puerto Rican pastel is a banana leaf. *Lech√≥n ‚Äì Pork is central to Puerto Rican holiday cooking, especially the lech√≥n (spit-roasted piglet). Holiday feasts might include several pork dishes, such as pernil (a baked fresh pork shoulder seasoned in adobo mojado), morcilla (a black blood sausage), and jam√≥n con pi√±a (ham and pineapple). *Ensaladas ‚Äì Most Puerto Rican tables on the holidays have one or two salads. A topical salad would be potato salad with peppers, onions, mayonnaise and with or without chorizo. Macaroni salad with peppers, onions, tomatoes and can tuna or spam. The macaroni is tossed usually in mayonnaise or vinegar and olive oil. Octopus with a citrus vinaigrette and tropical fruits. flan, including coffee, coconut cream, breadfruit, pineapple, pumpkin, carrot, cheese and many more. *'Dulce ‚Äì Sweets are common in Puerto Rican cuisine.

Most meals include fried appetizers, tostones being the island favorite, with rice and bean, stews, soups and other meals. Mofongo with fried pork with stews and soups. Small bit size pastelillos, empanadas or empanadillas are filled with cheese, pork, chicken or beef and can be a start to a meal. Puerto Rico has become popular for their fried food, which can be found in Cuba, Panama, Dominican Republic, and parts of the U.S. Deep-fried sweet plantains *Almoj√°bana ‚Äì A fritter made from rice flour, baking soda, cheese (queso blanco, cheddar, or mozzarella), Parmesan cheese, milk and egg. This mixture is used to make a dough that is fried into a ball. This frying is done mostly in the Western region of the island where they can be found for sale in stalls, caf√©s and festivities. Its preparation, however, is more common during the Christmas season, as an appetizer at parties, although traditionally they are eaten for breakfast by wetting them in coffee. It is also a common in the villages in the central-oeste area and the village of Lares where it is consumed daily for breakfast by many of its inhabitants. Every April, Lares hosts the Almoj√°bana Festival, which includes a crafts fair, live music, and an agricultural fair. *Croquetas de panap√©n con bacalao ‚Äì Fried salted cod fish balls mixed with mashed breadfruit, eggs, butter, roasted garlic and seasoning. *Macabeos ‚Äì A green banana fritter.

Everywhere in Puerto Rico, rustic stalls displaying all kinds fritters under heat lamps or behind a glass pane. Kiosks, are a much-frequented, time-honored, and integral part to a day at the beach and the culinary culture of the island. Fresh octopus and conch salad are frequently seen. Much larger kiosks serve hamburgers, local/Caribbean fusion, Thai, Italian, Mexican and even Peruvian food. This mixing of the new cuisine and the classic Puerto Rican food. Alcoholic beverage are a big part of kiosks with most kiosks having a signature drink. *Alcapurrias ‚Äì Fritters that are usually made with a masa mixture of eddoe (yaut√≠a) and green bananas (guineos verdes) or yuca, and are stuffed with either a meat (pino) filling or with crab, shrimp or lobster. *Ara√±itas ‚Äì This get their name from their shape, a play on ara√±a, or spider.

It is the same dough that's been flavored with annatto and lard, stuffed with beef, rolled-up and fried. In some kiosks there were also one filled with a cheese dog, although it is not a traditional Puerto Rican option. =Puerto Rican food outside the archipelago= Cuchifritos (carnitas) in New York Jibarito and rice *Cuchifritos ‚Äì In New York, cuchifritos are quite popular. Cuchifritos, often known as \\"Puerto Rican soul food\\" includes a variety of dishes, including, but not limited to: morcilla (blood sausage), chicharron (fried pork skin), patitas (pork feet), masitas (fried porkmeat), and various other parts of the pig prepared in different ways. *Jibarito (Plaintain Sandwich) ‚Äì In Chicago, El Jibarito is a popular dish. The word j√≠baro in Puerto Rico means a man from the countryside, especially a small landowner or humble farmer from far up in the mountains. Typically served with Puerto Rican yellow rice, Jibaritos consist of a meat along with mayonnaise, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and onions, all sandwiched between a fried plantain, known as a canoa (canoe). In the early 20th century, bread made from wheat (which would have to be imported) was expensive out in the mountain towns of the Cordillera Central, and j√≠baros were made from plantains which are still grown there on the steep hillsides. The version introduced to Chicago was originally made with skirt steak, but today it can be found in versions made with chicken, roast pork, ham, shrimp and even the vegetarian option tofu is available.  Puerto Rican Cookbooks  Cookbooks provide a window into the rich history and culture of a region, and as food policy and nutrition scholar, Melissa Fuster, states ‚Äúthey provide prescriptions for specific dishes and, in some cases, directives on what constitutes a proper meal.‚Äù One famous and intently studied Puerto Rican cookbook titled Cocina Criolla by Carmen Valldejuli, does just that. As revealed in Fuster‚Äôs article, Writing Cuisine in the Spanish Caribbean: A Comparative Analysis of Iconic Puerto Rican and Cuban Cooks, the cookbook not only has numerous chapters with dozens of recipes dedicated to soups, meats, pasta, sauces, sweets, breads and so on, but it opens with chapters that introduce the reader to the home cook and cooking as an experience. The reader learns that this book was written to act as an instructional manual to be used. Moreover, as Fuster details, cookbook author Valldejuli comes from an elite background, which is mimicked in the sheer number of recipes she includes.

The database forked from Borland's open source edition of InterBase in 2000, but since Firebird 1.5 the code has been largely rewritten. Firebird 1.5.5 General Notes for rewriting it from C to C++ language History Within a week of the InterBase 6.0 source being released by Borland on 25 July 2000, the Firebird project was created on SourceForge. Firebird 1.0 was released for Linux, Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X on 11 March 2002, with ports to Solaris, FreeBSD 4, HP-UX over the next two months. Work on porting the codebase from C to C++ began in 2000. On 23 February 2004, Firebird 1.5 was released, which was the first stable release of the new codebase. Version 1.5 featured an improved query optimizer, SQL-92 conditional expressions, SQL:1999 savepoints and support for explicit locking. Firebird 2.0 was released on 12 November 2006, adding support for 64-bit architectures, tables nested in FROM clauses, and programmable lock timeouts in blocking transactions. The previous stable release was version 2.1.6, which added new features including procedural triggers, recursive queries, and support for SQL:2003 MERGE statements. Firebird 2.5 introduced new features like improved multithreading, regular expression syntax and the ability to query remote databases. The most recent stable version is Firebird 3.0, released 19 April 2016, with focus in performance and security. A major re-architecture of the code allowed total support to SMP machines when using the SuperServer version. Through the Google Summer of Code 2013 work has begun on integrating Firebird as a replacement for HSQLDB in LibreOffice. =Mozilla Firefox name conflict= In April 2003, the Mozilla Organization announced a rename of its web browser from Phoenix to Firebird after a trademark dispute with Phoenix Technologies. This decision caused concern within the Firebird database project due to the assumption that users and Internet search engines would be confused by a database and a web browser both using the name Firebird. The Mozilla developers issued a statement, making clear that their software package was called \\"Mozilla Firebird\\", not \\"Firebird\\". The statement also said that the Mozilla Firebird name was a project codename. The dispute was resolved on February 9, 2004, when Mozilla changed the name of its browser to Mozilla Firefox, thus ending the conflict. Main features * Full support for stored procedures and triggers * Full ACID compliant transactions * Referential integrity * Multi Generational Architecture (sometimes called MVCC) * Support for External Functions (UDFs) * SQL activity can send asynchronous notification events to clients * Third-party tools, including GUI administrative tools and replication tools * Careful writes - fast recovery, no need for transaction logs * Many access methods: native/API, dbExpress/FireDACFireDAC drivers, ODBC, OLE DB, .NET provider, JDBC native type 4 driver, Python module,https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fdb/ PHP, Perl * Incremental backups * Full cursor implementation in PSQL Storage and index technology =The Multi-Generational Architecture (MGA)= Firebird inherited the storage architecture of Interbase. To ensure the ACID properties of transactions, the database engine keeps different versions of each record changed by the active users in the database. When the transactions are committed, the last version of every changed record is marked as the definitive. If transactions are rolled back, the database engine keeps the mark on the original record versions, leaving them untouched. As a result, Firebird disk writes are very reduced compared to databases that use the traditional transaction log architecture. Writing transactions does not prevent reading and vice versa, because each one sees its own version of the database. The tradeoff is that some maintenance (‚Äúsweeping‚Äù) is required from time to time to clean up old record versions and free disk space. The multi-generational architecture ensures that OLTP and DSS/OLAP operations can be run simultaneously without the delays caused by locking mechanisms found in other products. =Indexes= Firebird makes all indices of the database behave like well-tuned ‚Äúclustered indexes‚Äù used by other architectures. Firebird index buckets aren't subject to two-phase locking, and boolean ‚Äúand‚Äù and ‚Äúor‚Äù operations can be performed on intermediate bitmaps at a negligible cost, eliminating the need for the optimizer to choose between alternative indexes. Variants * Firebird SuperServer has a single daemon/server for all client connections, multithreaded with shared cache * Firebird SuperClassic also has a single daemon/server for all client connections, multithreaded with separate caches * Firebird Classic uses inetd to run one copy of the server per client connection, recommended for SMP systems but might have event-notification issues if access is via a firewall * Firebird Embedded for creating CD-ROM catalogs, single user or evaluation versions of applications Licensing The Firebird database engine and its modules are released under an open-source license, the Initial Developer's Public License (IDPL), a variant of the Mozilla Public License (MPL) version 1.1. It does not require the developer to open the products using Firebird or even custom-derivatives made from its source code, but if the developer chooses to do so, then some terms and conditions should be honored. The IDPL allows the developer to make proprietary, closed-source applications that use Firebird or are based on it. Connectivity APIs =Low-level Firebird Native API, Services API and embedded SQL= The Firebird native API is used directly or indirectly by applications or middleware that connect to a Firebird database. It is implemented in the client library, fbclient.dll, on Windows systems, and in libfbclient.so on Unix ones. The Services API is a special function set for accessing and controlling service administration tasks such as user management, backup/restore and statistics gathering. Embedded SQL is a technique that simplifies the development of C/C++ and COBOL Firebird applications, by using a preprocessor called gpre, which allows the embedding of SQL statements directly into the source code of the host language.

An axiomatic characterization of these fields via valuation theory was given by Emil Artin and George Whaples in the 1940s. and Formal definitions A global field is one of the following: ;An algebraic number field An algebraic number field F is a finite (and hence algebraic) field extension of the field of rational numbers Q. Thus F is a field that contains Q and has finite dimension when considered as a vector space over Q. ;The function field of an algebraic curve over a finite field A function field of a variety is the set of all rational functions on that variety. On an algebraic curve (i.e. a one-dimensional variety V) over a finite field, we say that a rational function on an open affine subset U is defined as the ratio of two polynomials in the affine coordinate ring of U, and that a rational function on all of V consists of such local data which agree on the intersections of open affines. This technically defines the rational functions on V to be the field of fractions of the affine coordinate ring of any open affine subset, since all such subsets are dense. Analogies between the two classes of fields There are a number of formal similarities between the two kinds of fields. A field of either type has the property that all of its completions are locally compact fields (see local fields). Every field of either type can be realized as the field of fractions of a Dedekind domain in which every non-zero ideal is of finite index. In each case, one has the product formula for non-zero elements x: :\\\\prod_v x_v = 1.\\\\ The analogy between the two kinds of fields has been a strong motivating force in algebraic number theory. The idea of an analogy between number fields and Riemann surfaces goes back to Richard Dedekind and Heinrich M. Weber in the nineteenth century. The more strict analogy expressed by the 'global field' idea, in which a Riemann surface's aspect as algebraic curve is mapped to curves defined over a finite field, was built up during the 1930s, culminating in the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields settled by Andr√© Weil in 1940. The terminology may be due to Weil, who wrote his Basic Number Theory (1967) in part to work out the parallelism. It is usually easier to work in the function field case and then try to develop parallel techniques on the number field side. The development of Arakelov theory and its exploitation by Gerd Faltings in his proof of the Mordell conjecture is a dramatic example. The analogy was also influential in the development of Iwasawa theory and the Main Conjecture. The proof of the fundamental lemma in the Langlands program also made use of techniques that reduced the number field case to the function field case. Theorems =Hasse‚ÄìMinkowski theorem= The Hasse‚ÄìMinkowski theorem is a fundamental result in number theory which states that two quadratic forms over a global field are equivalent if and only if they are equivalent locally at all places, i.e. equivalent over every completion of the field. =Artin reciprocity law= Artin's reciprocity law implies a description of the abelianization of the absolute Galois group of a global field K which is based on the Hasse local‚Äìglobal principle. It can be described in terms of cohomology as follows: Let Lv‚ÅÑKv be a Galois extension of local fields with Galois group G. The local reciprocity law describes a canonical isomorphism : \\\\theta_v: K_v^{\\\\times}/N_{L_v/K_v}(L_v^{\\\\times}) \\\\to G^{\\\\text{ab}}, called the local Artin symbol, the local reciprocity map or the norm residue symbol.Serre (1967) p.140Serre (1979) p.197 Let L‚ÅÑK be a Galois extension of global fields and CL stand for the id√®le class group of L. The maps Œ∏v for different places v of K can be assembled into a single global symbol map by multiplying the local components of an id√®le class. One of the statements of the Artin reciprocity law is that this results in the canonical isomorphismNeukirch (1999) p.391J√ºrgen Neukirch, Algebraische Zahlentheorie, Springer, 1992, p. 408. In fact, a more precise version of the reciprocity law keeps track of the ramification. Notes References  J.W.S. Cassels, \\"Global fields\\", in J.W.S. Cassels and A.

The community is divided into two distinct areas: Red House (Proper) which follows the Kanawha River Valley along WV 62, and Red House Hill along WV 34 which is in the hills just off the Kanawha River Valley. The Red House Post Office is still in service and was founded on September 26, 1840. Some say the town was named for a red house which stood at the town site, while others believe nearby red rock formations account for the name.  Geography  Red House is located on WV 62 which generally follows the Kanawha River, between Hometown and Eleanor, and consists primarily of single family homes. The Red House Hill area is primarily a mix of hilly farms (including cattle, horses, limited tobacco production, corn, etc.), and small land plots whose owners are commuters to the Charleston and Huntington metropolitan and surrounding areas. The closest neighbors to Red House are Confidence, Hometown, Winfield, and Eleanor. Due to the extremely winding mountain terrain, WV 34 is a very dangerous road for a 21-mile stretch from its junction with WV 62 to Kenna, where it intersects with County Route 21, which provides access to I-77. Because of the winding nature of WV 34 and the proximity to the Putnam County line, the road actually passes through Putnam County, Kanawha County and finally Jackson County, several times along the 21 mile length.  Education  Public education in the area is served by Confidence Elementary School (located in Confidence), Buffalo Elementary School (located in Buffalo), Buffalo High School (also located in Buffalo), George Washington Elementary School (located in Eleanor), George Washington Middle School (also located in Eleanor), and Poca High School (located in Poca).  Fire service  Fire service in the area is primarily provided by the Route 34 Volunteer Fire Department & 2nd due, Eleanor Volunteer Fire Department.  Churches  Five churches exist in Red House: United Brethren Church, (Red House hill); Wade Chapel United Methodist Church, (Red House hill); Riverside Baptist Church, (Red House proper); Lone Oak Church of God, (Red House hill); and Grandview Baptist Church, (Red House hill).

It was fought from September 26, 1918, until the Armistice of November 11, 1918, a total of 47 days. The Meuse‚ÄìArgonne offensive was the largest in United States military history, involving 1.2 million American soldiers. It is the second deadliest battle in American history, resulting in over 350,000 casualties including 28,000 German lives, 26,277 American lives and an unknown number of French lives. U.S. losses were worsened by the inexperience of many of the troops, the tactics used during the early phases of the operation and the widespread onset of the global influenza outbreak called the \\"Spanish flu\\". Meuse‚ÄìArgonne was the principal engagement of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) during World War I. It was one of a series of Allied attacks known as the Hundred Days Offensive, which brought the war to an end. It was the largest and bloodiest operation of World War I for the AEF even if, given the scale of other battles on the Western Front, its size was limited and the operation itself secondary as it was far from the main offensive axis. Overview The logistic prelude to the Meuse attack was planned by then U.S. Colonel George Marshall who managed to move American units to the front after the Battle of Saint-Mihiel (Saint- Mihiel is a town on the river Meuse, the most important water obstacle on the Western Front). The September/October Allied breakthroughs (north, center, and east) across the length of the Front line ‚Äì including the Battle of the Argonne Forest ‚Äì are now lumped together as part of what is generally remembered as the Grand Offensive (also known as the Hundred Days Offensive) by the Allies on the Western Front. The Meuse‚ÄìArgonne offensive also involved troops from France, while the rest of the Allies, including France, Britain and its dominion and imperial armies (mainly Canada, Australia, and New Zealand), and Belgium contributed to major battles in more North-Western sectors of the western front, including the Hindenburg line. German soldiers drawing water After the main 1918 German offensive that began well for them but ended with the disaster of Reims in front of the French army and at Amiens to British empire forces, The French and British armies launched \\"The Grand Offensive\\" or the \\"100 days offensive\\", systematically pushing back a German army whose efficiency was decreasing rapidly. British, French, and Belgian advances in the north-western sectors of the front, along with the French‚ÄìAmerican advances around the Argonne forest, is in turn credited for leading directly to the Armistice of November 11, 1918. On September 26, the Americans began their strike north toward Sedan. The next day, British and Belgian divisions drove toward Ghent (Belgium). British and French armies attacked across northern France on September 28. The scale of the overall offensive, bolstered by the fresh and eager but largely untried and inexperienced U.S. troops, signaled renewed vigor among the Allies and sharply dimmed German hopes for victory. The Meuse‚ÄìArgonne battle was the largest frontline commitment of troops by the U.S. Army in World War I, and also its deadliest. Command was coordinated, with some U.S. troops (e.g. the Buffalo Soldiers of the 92nd Division and the 93rd Division) attached and serving under French command (e.g. XVII Corps during the second phase). Prelude Sedan‚ÄìVerdun and vicinity: The Meuse‚ÄìArgonne offensive, September‚ÄìNovember 1918 (c. 1938). =Opposing forces= The American forces initially consisted of 15 divisions of the U.S. First Army commanded by General John J. Pershing until October 16 and then by Lieutenant General Hunter Liggett. The logistics were planned and directed by then Colonel George C. Marshall. The French forces next to them consisted of 31 divisions, including the Fourth Army (under Henri Gouraud) and the Fifth Army (under Henri Mathias Berthelot). The U.S. divisions of the AEF were oversized (12 battalions per division versus the French-British-German nine battalions per division), being up to twice the size of other Allies' battle-depleted divisions upon arrival, but the French and other Allied divisions had been partly replenished prior to the Grand Offensive, so both the U.S. and French contributions in troops were considerable. Most of the heavy equipment (tanks, artillery, and aircraft) was provided by the Allies. For the Meuse‚ÄìArgonne front alone, this represented 2,780 artillery pieces, 380 tanks, and 840 planes. Concerning armored support, the 35th Division was completed by the 1st Tank Brigade (under George S. Patton) with 127 American-crewed Renault FT light tank and 28 French-crewed Schneider medium tanks. The 3d US Tank brigade with 250 French-crewed tank was also involved supporting the V Corps. The 37th and 79th Division were augmented with a French tank regiment (Renault FT light tank) and 2 groups of medium tank (St-Chamond). The 91st Division was augmented with a equivalent force (1 light tank regiment and 2 groups medium tank). As the battle progressed, both the Americans and the French brought in reinforcements. Eventually, 22 American divisions participated in the battle at one time or another, representing two full field armies. Other French forces involved included the 2nd Colonial Corps, under Henri Claudel, which had also fought alongside the AEF at the Battle of Saint-Mihiel earlier in September 1918. Gen. John J. Pershing, Commander in Chief of the American Expeditionary Forces (A. E. F.) Lt. Gen. Hunter Liggett, Commander of First Army Robert L. Bullard, Commander of Second Army The opposing forces were wholly German. During this period of the war, German divisions procured only 50 percent or less of their initial strength. The 117th Division, which opposed the U.S. 79th Division during the offensive's first phase, had only 3,300 men in its ranks. Morale varied among German units. For example, divisions that served on the Eastern front had high morale, while conversely divisions that had been on the Western front had poor morale. Resistance grew to approximately 200,000‚Äì450,000 German troops from the Fifth Army of Group Gallwitz commanded by General Georg von der Marwitz. The Americans estimated that they opposed parts of 44 German divisions overall, though many fewer at any one time. =Objective= The Allied objective was the capture of the railway hub at Sedan that would break the railway network supporting the German Army in France and Flanders. Battle =First phase (September 26 ‚Äì October 4, 1918)= \\"During the three hours preceding H hour, the Allies expended more ammunition than both sides managed to fire throughout the four years of the [American] Civil War. The cost was later calculated to have been $180 million, or $1 million per minute.\\" The American attack began at 05:30 on September 26 with mixed results. The V and III Corps met most of their objectives, but the 79th Division failed to capture Montfaucon, the 28th \\"Keystone\\" Division's attack virtually ground to a halt due to formidable German resistance, and the 91st \\"Wild West\\" Division was compelled to evacuate the village of √âpinonville though it advanced . The inexperienced 37th \\"Buckeye\\" Division failed to capture Montfaucon d'Argonne. The subsequent day, September 27 most of the 1st Army failed to make any gains. The 79th Division finally captured Montfaucon and the 35th \\"Santa Fe\\" Division captured the village of Baulny, Hill 218, and Charpentry, placing the division forward of adjacent units. On September 29, six extra German divisions were deployed to oppose the American attack, with the 5th Guards and 52nd Division counterattacking the 35th Division, which had run out of food and ammunition during the attack. The Germans initially made significant gains, but were barely repulsed by the 35th Division's 110th Engineers, 128th Machine Gun Battalion, and Harry Truman's Battery D, 129th Field Artillery. In the words of Pershing, \\"We were no longer engaged in a maneuver for the pinching out of a salient, but were necessarily committed, generally speaking, to a direct frontal attack against strong, hostile positions fully manned by a determined enemy.\\" The German counterattack had shattered so much of the 35th Division‚Äîa poorly led division, most of whose key leaders had been replaced shortly before the attack, made up of National Guard units from Missouri and Kansas‚Äîthat it had to be relieved early, though remnants of the division subsequently reentered the battle. Part of the adjacent French attack met temporary confusion when one of its generals died. Nevertheless, it was able to advance , penetrating deeply into the German lines, especially around Somme-Py (the Battle of Somme-Py ()) and northwest of Reims (the Battle of Saint-Thierry ()). The initial progress of the French forces was thus faster than the gained by the adjacent American units, though the French units were fighting in a more open terrain, which is an easier terrain from which to attack. =Second phase (October 4‚Äì28, 1918)= The second phase began on October 4, when the first assault divisions (the 91st, 79th, 37th and 35th) were replaced by the 32nd, 3rd and 1st Divisions. The 1st Division created a gap in the lines when it advanced against the 37th, 52nd, and 5th Guards Divisions. It was during this phase that the Lost Battalion affair occurred. The battalion was rescued by an attack by the 28th and 82nd Divisions (the 82nd attacking soon after taking up its positions in the gap between the 28th and 1st Divisions) on October 7. The Americans launched a series of costly frontal assaults that finally broke through the main German defenses (the Kriemhilde Stellung of the Hindenburg Line) between October 14‚Äì17 (the Battle of Montfaucon ()). By the end of October, U.S. troops had advanced ten miles and cleared the Argonne Forest. On their left the French had advanced twenty miles, reaching the Aisne River. It was during the opening of this operation, on October 8, that Corporal (later Sergeant) Alvin York made his famous capture of 132 German prisoners near Cornay. =Third phase (October 28 ‚Äì November 11, 1918)= By October 31, the Americans had advanced and had cleared the Argonne Forest. On their left the French had advanced , reaching the River Aisne. The American forces reorganized into two armies. The First, led by General Liggett, moved to the Carignan-Sedan-Mezieres Railroad. The Second Army, led by Lieutenant General Robert L. Bullard, was directed to move eastward toward Metz. The two U.S. armies faced portions of 31 German divisions during this phase. The American troops captured German defenses at Buzancy, allowing French troops to cross the River Aisne, whence they rushed forward, capturing Le Chesne (the Battle of Chesne ()). In the final days, the French forces conquered the immediate objective, Sedan and its critical railroad hub (the Advance to the Meuse ()), on November 6 and American forces captured surrounding hills. On November 11, news of the German armistice put a sudden end to the fighting.

Poland is mostly a country of flatlands and fields and mounted forces operate well in this environment. The knights and heavy cavalry gradually evolved into many different types of specialised mounted military formations, some of which heavily influenced western warfare and military science. This article details the evolution of Polish cavalry tactics, traditions and arms from the times of mounted knights and heavy winged hussars, through the times of light uhlans to mounted infantry equipped with ranged and m√™l√©e weapons. Early medieval times The first Polish cavalry was created by the Duke of Polans - Mieszko I, who united the West Slav tribes in the area of modern Poland. It's noted in the manuscript of Abraham ben Jacob who traveled in 961‚Äì62 in Central Europe. He wrote that the dru≈ºyna of Mieszko I had 3000 men, who were paid by the duke.\\"IbrƒÅhƒ´m ibn Ya‚Äõq≈´b al-IsrƒÅ'ƒ´lƒ´ al-·π¨ur·π≠≈´shƒ´,\\" by Lutz Richter-Bernburg, in: The Oxford Companion to World Exploration, David Buisseret, editor-in-chief, 2 vols., Oxford UP 2007, I:402b-403b The Prince's druzhina also received a share of military loot. Battle of Grunwald Until the 14th century, the Polish armed forces were composed mostly of mounted soldiers. By the start of the 15th century, the core of the Polish armies was formed by mounted knights called to arms by the kings. The basic tactical unit of the army was a banner (chorƒÖgiew), that is, a group of approximately 50 men financed by a noble clan, a notable person or a land owner. The banner fought separately and included all the necessary detachments, including its own kitchen, tabors and servants. Polish-Lithuanian state, late 17th century Towarzysz pancerny One of the finest examples of usage of the early Polish cavalry was the Battle of Grunwald of 1410. During the battle, the Polish armoured cavalry was used to break through the Teutonic lines. In addition, the Polish forces were helped by Lithuanian light cavalry of Eastern origins and by Tartar skirmishers, who used mostly hit-and-run tactics. During the battle, after initial clashes of the light cavalry, the Teutonic Order split its forces, which were then defeated by an armoured cavalry charge. 16th and 17th centuries In the 16th century the introduction of gunpowder and firearms made the medieval armoured cavalry obsolete. The standing army of the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth was gradually converted to other, more modern forms of cavalry. Under eastern influence, the armament of the cavalrymen was lightened and their speed and mobility increased, which added to the successes of the Polish cavalry in numerous wars against Muscovy, Ottomans and the Tartars. Polish Winged Hussar, wings visible. Painting by Aleksander Or≈Çowski 1503 saw the formation of a first hussar unit in Poland. Being far more manoeuvrable than the heavily armoured lancers previously employed, the hussars proved vital to the Polish victories at Orsza (1514) and Obertyn (1531). By the reign of King Stefan Batory, the hussars had replaced medieval- style lancers in the Polish army, and they now formed the bulk of the Polish cavalry. Over the course of the 16th century hussars had become heavier in character: they had abandoned wooden shields and adopted plate metal body armour. With the Battle of Lubiesz√≥w in 1577 the 'Golden Age' of the husaria began. Until the Battle of Vienna in 1683, the Polish hussars fought countless actions against a variety of enemies, and rarely lost a battle. In the battles of Byczyna (1588), Kokenhausen (1601), Kluszyn (1610), Gniew (1626), Chocim (1673) and Lw√≥w (1675), the Polish hussars proved to be the decisive factor often against overwhelming odds. One of the most notable examples of such victories of the Lithuanian Grand Duchy hussars was the Battle of Kircholm of 1605, in which 3,000 hussars under Jan Karol Chodkiewicz managed to defeat 11,000 soldiers of Charles IX of Sweden - with negligible losses. As one of the very few units in the Polish national standing army (most of other units were formed as mobilizers), the hussars were well-trained and well-equipped. Until the 18th century they were considered the elite of the Polish national armed forces. Because of the extreme cost, lackluster pay, fame and prestige that surrounded the hussars, almost all of them were members of the upper level nobility (szlachta). Although by the 18th century their importance was diminished by the collapse of the Polish military system and not by the introduction of modern infantry firearms and quick-firing artillery, the Polish hussars' tactics and armament remained almost unchanged until they were absorbed into the National Cavalry regiments in the 1770s. At first hussars performed most services but as they grew heavier the need arose for a medium or lighter cavalry. The 16th century saw creation of lighter cavalry known as 'Kozacy' (singular 'Kozak' hence 'towarzysz kozacki') until 1648 and then known as 'Pancerni' from the 1650s on until the 1770s, 'Kozacy Pancerni' can be translated as 'Armoured cossacks') in the Kingdom of Poland or 'Petyhorcy' in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (the actual subject of the illustration) - whose offensive armament included a shorter 'demi-lance' ('dzida') or 'rohatyna', bow and arrows, war-ax, sabre in the 16th century and a pistol or two, a carbine in the 17th and 18th centuries. The lighter yet cavalry was created during the Muscovite Wars of the early 17th century, the most famous unit or type was known as Lisowczyk, after their commander Aleksander Lisowski, that fought in the 30 Years War as well. Along with these mentioned Polish or Lithuanian horsemen there were banners/companies of lighter cavalry drawn from Lithuanian Tatars (serving in their own banners under their precarious legal status), Romanian (\\"Wallachian\\"), Cheremis, Circassians (similar to Kozak/Pancerni) and Hungarians. Uhlan fighting a foot soldier The early 18th century saw the creation of yet another cavalry formation that influenced most European armies of the time: the uhlans. Initially light cavalry companies formed by Polish Tatars (the very word ulan came from Lithuanian Tartar surname that might have come from an honorific name for a young, skilled warrior known as oglan) for one of the magantes, Sapieha, the uhlans joined the forces of Augustus der Starke, the king of Poland-Lithuania- Saxony, and in early 1740s 18th century the first uhlan 'pulks' (regiments) - known as uhlans - were formed for his son, king Augustus III. The uhlans were light cavalry armed with lances, sabres and pistols, which gave them enough power and at the same time adding to their versatility and manoeuvrability. In addition, the Polish uhlans, or u≈Çani as they were called in their native tongue, introduced a new uniform style composed of a colourful jacket with a coloured panel in the front, dark trousers with colourful stripes on the sides and a high, pointed cap called czapka (often rendered chapska in English). 19th century: the Napoleonic Era Battle of Somosierra, one of greatest successes of 19th-century Polish cavalry With the advent of the 19th century Poland was partitioned by her neighbours. However, the Polish army was not disbanded and instead most of it was simply drafted into the armies of the occupying countries. Thanks to that, the Polish cavalry traditions were retained. After the creation of Duchy of Warsaw, many Poles volunteered for the Polish cavalry units fighting in the Napoleonic Wars alongside the French army. The new formation of uhlans proved to be not only fast and effective, but also very influential: during the Napoleonic Wars the uhlans of the Duchy of Warsaw were among the most effective cavalry units and by the end of that period most of European states copied both their tactics and their uniforms. Together with the French, the Polish cavalry took part in many of the most notable battles of the Napoleonic period, including the battles of Smolensk, Fuengirola, Raszyn, and many others. Also, the Polish cavalrymen were the first unit of the Napoleon's Grande Arm√©e to enter Moscow Kremlin during the Napoleon's invasion of Russia. Finally, the Polish cavalry detachments were also present in Haiti, where they helped the French administration to quell a slave revolt. However, perhaps the most notable success of the Polish cavalry in that period (and certainly the best known) is the Battle of Somosierra, a part of the Peninsular War. Uniform of 2nd Uhlan Regiment of Polish Legions (1914‚Äì1918) Kurtka and czapka of lance corporal of 1st Greater Poland Uhlans Reg. aka 15th Uhlans Regiment During his advance on Madrid, Napoleon was blocked on November 30, 1808, by 9,000 Spaniards under General San Juan in the valley of Somosierra in the Sierra de Guadarrama. Because of the rough and uneven terrain, the Spanish forces could not easily be outflanked. Their positions were well-fortified and guarded with artillery. Impatient to proceed towards Madrid, Napoleon ordered his Polish light cavalry escort of some 87 troops, led by Jan Kozietulski, to charge the Spaniards. Despite losing two thirds of their numbers, the Poles succeeded in forcing the defenders to abandon their position. 20th century =The Polish-Soviet War= In November, 1918 Poland was re-established following World War I, there were already several Polish cavalry units existing. Some of them were created as parts of either Austro-Hungarian or German Armies while others were created in Russia and as part of the French-based Blue Army. Because of that, each cavalry unit in the reborn Polish Army used different uniforms, different equipment and different strategy. However, all of the units shared the same traditions and, despite all the differences, were able to cooperate on the battlefield. In late January, 1919 the reorganisation of the Polish Army began. All previously-existent cavalry squadrons were pressed into 14 newly formed cavalry regiments, which in turn were joined into six cavalry brigades after March 7, 1919. Later a seventh brigade was added and some of the brigades were joined into two semi-independent cavalry divisions. The newly recreated Polish Cavalry units were of modern type and were trained in both cavalry tactics and in trench warfare. After the Polish-Soviet War broke out, these were one of the very few combat-ready troops in Polish service. The lack of advanced military equipment on both sides of the front made the cavalry a decisive weapon in breaking the enemy lines and encircling the Russian units. In addition, smaller cavalry detachments (usually squadron-sized) were attached to every infantry brigade and served as reconnaissance and support units. Also, the lack of sophisticated equipment made the traditional role of the cavalry once again important. The Polish cavalry units were equipped with sabres, lances and all types of armament that were typically used by the cavalry in previous centuries. During the war, the Polish cavalry brigades and divisions took part in most of the notable battles, including the pivotal Battle of Warsaw, in which they played a crucial role in surrounding the withdrawing Red Army, and in the Battle of the Niemen, in which the cavalry was vital in breaking the enemy lines near Grodno. However, the most important cavalry battle took place on August 31, 1920, near the village of Komarowo near Zamo≈õƒá. The battle was a complete disaster for the Soviet 1st Cavalry Army which sustained heavy casualties and barely avoided being totally surrounded. After that battle, the 1st Cavalry Army's morale had collapsed and the army, which was one of the most feared of the Soviet troops, was no longer considered an effective fighting force. Because of the numbers of forces involved, the Battle of Komar√≥w is considered the greatest cavalry battle of the 20th century. Along with the battles then taking place in south Russia, this was one of the last battles fought mostly by cavalry units, in which traditional cavalry tactics were used and sabers and lances played a vital role. Because of that, it is sometimes referred to (by Poles) as \\"the greatest cavalry battle after 1813\\" and the last cavalry battle. =World War II= Polish cavalry in the 1930s. Polish uhlan with wz. 35 anti-tank rifle. Military instruction published in Warsaw in 1938. During the German invasion of Poland in 1939, cavalry formed 10% of the Polish Army.Henryk Smaczny, \\"Ksiƒôga kawalerii polskiej\\" (ang. Book of Polish cavalry), TESCO, Warszawa 1989, Cavalry units were organised in 11 cavalry brigades, each composed of 3 to 4 cavalry regiments with organic artillery, armoured unit and infantry battalion. Two additional brigades had recently been converted to motorized and armoured units, but they retained their cavalry traditions. In addition, every infantry division had an organic cavalry detachment used for reconnaissance. In contrast with its traditional role in armed conflicts of the past (even in the Polish-Soviet War), the cavalry was no longer seen as a unit capable of breaking through enemy lines. Instead, it was used as a mobile reserve of the Polish armies and was using mostly infantry tactics: the soldiers dismounted before the battle and fought as a standard infantry. Despite media reports of the time, particularly in respect of the Battle of Krojanty, no cavalry charges were made by the Polish Cavalry against German tanks. The Polish cavalry, however, was successful against the German tanks in the Battle of Mokra.http://www.polamjournal.com/Library/APHistory/Cavalry_Myth/cavalry_myth.html The Mythical Polish Cavalry Charge The Polish cavalry did not discard the lance as a weapon until 1934 or 1937 and continued to use it for training purposes up to the outbreak of World War II. Although the cavalrymen retained their Szabla wz. 1934 sabres, after 1934Steven J. Zaloga, page 5 \\"The Polish Army 1939-45\\" or 1937Alan Larsen & Henry Yallop, The Cavalry Lance, p. 76, the lance ceased to be issued as a combat weapon and was retained for training purposes only. Instead, the cavalry units were equipped with modern armament, including 75 mm guns, tankettes, 37mm AT guns, 40mm AA guns, anti-tank rifles and other pieces of modern weaponry. During the campaign, the brigades were distributed among the Polish armies and served as mobile reserves. In this role, the Polish cavalry proved itself a successful measure in filling the gaps in the front and covering the withdrawal of friendly units. Polish cavalry units took part in most of the battles of 1939 and on several occasions proved to be the elite of the Polish Army. After the September Campaign, the Polish Army on the Western Front continued its pre-war tradition of Uhlan regiments giving their names to armoured units, while Polish units on the Eastern Front used cavalry as mobile infantry until the end of the war. After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, several Polish units, including cavalry forces, were formed by the Soviets. One of these units carried out the last Polish cavalry charge at the Battle of Schoenfeld, where a surprise cavalry assault succeeded in overrunning the German defensive positions. =After World War II= Soldiers of 1st Tank Battalion (1. batalion czo≈Çg√≥w) of 15th Greater Polish Brigade of Armoured Cavalry (15.

Dywizjon Lotniczy) of 25th Aeromobile Cavalry Brigade (25. Brygada Kawalerii Powietrznej) Combat cavalry units existed in the Polish Army until January 27, 1947, when the 1st Warsaw Cavalry Division was disbanded. The last Polish cavalry unit, the Representative Squadron of the President of Poland, was disbanded in July 1948. However, after several years of gathering funds, a group of enthusiasts formed in 2000 the Representative Squadron of Cavalry of the Polish Army. The unit is under the auspices of the army, which thus returned to its cavalry tradition. The squadron is present at most official anniversary celebrations in Warsaw, as well as other towns of Poland. In other places people are forming reenactment groups that continues, often with help of army, the traditions of local cavalry units. An example of such a society is the Volunteer Representative Squadron of City of Pozna≈Ñ which is a tribute to the 15th Pozna≈Ñ Uhlans Regiment. These remained until the Eastern Bloc collapsed, as the Soviet Union collapsed too. Afterwards, The Polish military was freely able to expand, or follow whatever perimeters it wanted. The combat traditions of Polish cavalry are continued by the armoured (Kawaleria Pancerna) and aeromobile (Kawaleria Powietrzna) units of Polish Land Forces. Cavalry charges and propaganda Apart from countless battles and skirmishes in which the Polish cavalry units fought dismounted, there were 16 confirmed cavalry charges during the 1939 war. Contrary to common belief, most of them were successful. The first and perhaps best known cavalry charge happened on September 1, 1939, during the Battle of Krojanty. During this action, elements of the 18th Pomeranian Uhlan Regiment met a large group of German infantry resting in the woods near the village of Krojanty. Colonel Mastalerz decided to take the enemy by surprise and immediately ordered a cavalry charge, a tactic the Polish cavalry rarely used as their main weapon. The charge was successful and the German infantry unit was dispersed. The same day, German war correspondents were brought to the battlefield together with two journalists from Italy. They were shown the battlefield, the corpses of Polish cavalrymen and their horses, alongside German tanks that had arrived at the field of battle only after the engagement. One of the Italian correspondents sent home an article, in which he described the bravery and heroism of Polish soldiers, who charged German tanks with their sabres and lances. Other possible source of the myth is a quote from Heinz Guderian's memoirs, in which he asserted that the Pomeranian Brigade had charged on German tanks with swords and lances. Although such a charge did not happen and there were no tanks used during the combat, the myth was disseminated by German propaganda during the war with a staged Polish cavalry charge shown in their 1941 reel called \\"Geschwader L√ºtzow\\". After the end of World War II the same fraud was again being disseminated by Soviet propaganda as an example of the stupidity of Polish commanders and authorities, who allegedly did not prepare their country for war and instead wasted the blood of their soldiers. Even such prominent German writers as G√ºnter Grass, later accused of anti- Polonism by Jan J√≥zef Lipski among others, were falling victims to this Nazi deception. Grass wrote the following passage, somewhat metaphorically, in his famous novel The Tin Drum: :\\"O insane cavalry!‚Äîpicking blueberries on horseback. With wimpled lances, red and white. Squadrons of melancholy and tradition. Picture-book charges. Over the fields of Lodz and Kuno. Modlin, freeing the fortress. Galloping so brilliantly. Always awaiting the setting sun. Only then does the cavalry attack, when both foreground and background are splendid, for battle is so picturesque, and Death the artist's model, one leg engaged and one leg free, then plunging, nibbling blueberries, rose- hips tumble and burst, release the itch that spurs the cavalry to charge. Uhlans, itching again, wheel their horses about where shocks of straw are standing‚Äîthis too a striking image‚Äîand gather round a man called Don Quixote in Spain, but this one's name is Pan Kichot, a pureblood Pole of sad and noble mien, who's taught his uhlans how to kiss a lady's hand on horseback, so now they always kiss the hand of Death as if he were a lady, but gather first with sunset at their backs‚Äîfor atmosphere and mood are their reserves‚Äîthe German tanks before them, stallions from the stud farms of Krupp von Bohlen and Halbach, nobler steeds there never were. But that half-Spanish, half-Polish knight so in love with death‚Äîbrilliant Pan Kichot, too brilliant‚Äîlowers his red-white wimpled lance, bids you all to kiss the lady's hand, cries out so that the evening glows, red-white storks clatter on the rooftops, cherries spit out their pits, and he cries to the cavalry, \\"Ye noble Poles on horseback, those are not tanks of steel, they are windmills or sheep. I bid you all to kiss the lady's hand!\\"Grass, G√ºnter. The Tin Drum. Translated by Breon Mitchell. Hermann Luchterhand Verlag GmbH, 1959. https://www.scribd.com/read/249308891/The-Tin-Drum On 1 September 2009 Sir Simon Jenkins, writing for The Guardian newspaper's website, characterised the notion of pitting Polish cavalry against tanks as \\"the most romantic and idiotic act of suicide of modern war.\\" On 21 September 2009, The Guardian was forced to publish an admission that his article \\"repeated a myth of the second world war, fostered by Nazi propagandists, when it said that Polish lancers turned their horses to face Hitler's panzers. There is no evidence that this occurred.\\" \\"Representative Cavalry Squadron of Polish Army\\" on military parade in Warsaw commemorating the Feast of the Polish Army 2006 Polish Mounted Police city of Pozna≈Ñ Other cavalry charges of 1939 were as follows: # September 1 - Battle of Mokra - 19th Volhynian Uhlan Regiment took by surprise the elements of German 4th Panzer Division, which retreated in panic. During the charge, lances were used. In fact, the cavalry charge in the traditional sense was neither planned, nor executed. The mounted infantry rode over behind the attacking German armor in behind the tankettes with the tank men throwing smoke grenades to cover the approach. Indeed, the mounted infantry did repel the German support infantry and forced part of the German armored regiment to continue to advance while deprived of the infantry support. # September 1 - Battle of Jan√≥w - 11th Legions Uhlan Regiment on a reconnaissance mission encountered a similar unit of German cavalry. Lieut. Kossakowski ordered a cavalry charge, but the enemy did not accept battle and after a short clash withdrew towards their positions.Ryszard Juszkiewicz: 11 Pu≈Çk U≈Çan√≥w Legionowych im.

A charge was ordered, but the Germans withdrew. # September 11 - Osuchowo - 1st squadron of the 20th Uhlan Regiment of King Jan III Sobieski charged through the German infantry lines to avoid encirclement, and broke through. There were negligible losses on both sides. # September 11-12 - Ka≈Çuszyn - 4th squadron of the 11th Legions Uhlan Regiment charged overnight at the German positions in the town of Ka≈Çuszyn. Although the charge was a mistake (the Polish infantry commander issued a wrong order which was understood as a charge order while the cavalry was meant to simply move forward), it was a success. After heavy casualties on both sides, the town was retaken in the early morning. # September 13 - Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki - 1st squadron of the 2nd Regiment of Grochow Uhlans charged German infantry positions, but was repelled by German MG and artillery fire. # September 13 - Maliszewo - 1st squadron of the 27th Uhlan Regiment was engaged in heavy fighting near the village of Maliszewo. After the Germans were beaten and started to retreat towards the village, the Poles charged and took the village along with a large number of German prisoners. # September 15 - Broch√≥w - elements of the 17th Greater Poland Uhlan Regiment charged towards the German positions to frighten the enemy infantry. Shortly before reaching the range of enemy weapons, they dismounted and continued their assault on foot; the attack was successful. # September 16 - Dembowskie - a platoon from the 4th squadron of the 17th Uhlan Regiment charged towards a small German outpost located around a foresters' hut. The small number of Germans withdrew. # September 19 - Battle of W√≥lka Wƒôglowa - Most of the 14th Regiment of Jazlowiec Uhlans (without its MGs and AT platoon) was ordered to probe the German lines near the town of W√≥lka Wƒôglowa. After elements of 9th Regiment of Lesser Poland Uhlans arrived, the group was ordered to charge through the German lines to open the way towards Warsaw and Modlin for the rest of Polish forces who were withdrawing from the Battle of Bzura. The Poles charged through a German artillery barrage and took the German infantry by surprise. Polish losses were high (205 killed and wounded), the German losses remain unknown, but the Polish unit broke through and was the first to reach Warsaw after the Battle of Bzura.W≈Çodzimierz Pawlak.

After heavy casualties, they reached the hilltop on which the town was located. A unit of German organic cavalry from the German 8th Infantry Division countercharged from the hill, but was repelled and the Poles captured the town and took the HQ of the division, together with its commander and about 100 German soldiers. 40 Polish combatants previously taken prisoner by the Germans were also freed.Janusz Pieka≈Çkiewicz: Wojna kawalerii 1939‚Äì1945.

The charge was led by the mounted police, and the Soviet forces withdrew in panic. However, the attack was soon halted by a strong Soviet tank unit. Casualties were similar on both sides. # September 26 - Mora≈Ñce - 27th Uhlan Regiment twice charged an entrenched German infantry battalion in the village of Mora≈Ñce. Both charges were repelled with heavy casualties (the Poles lost 20 KIA and about 50 wounded, German losses are unknown). After the second charge the Germans sent out a soldier with a white flag and, after a short discussion with the Polish commander of the Nowogr√≥dek Cavalry Brigade, the Germans withdrew.

","title":"Polish cavalry"},{"id":"288367","text":"Sam Hose, a.k.a. Sam Holt, a.k.a. Samuel \\"Thomas\\" Wilkes, n√© Tom Wilkes (c. 1875 ‚Äì April 23, 1899) was an African American who was tortured and executed by a white lynch mob in Coweta County, Georgia.  Personal life  Sam Hose was born Tom Wilkes in south Georgia near Marshallville (Macon County), circa 1875. He grew up on a Macon County farm owned by the Jones family; his mother had been enslaved by the family. Hose was described by those who knew him as friendly and intelligent, and unusually for a black man in the 19th century South learned how to read and write. As his mother became almost an invalid as she aged, and Hose had an intellectually disabled brother to support, he had to abandon his plans for higher education, instead working as a manual laborer.  Accusation  Wilkes moved to Coweta County, where he assumed the alias Sam Hose. On April 12, 1899, he was accused of murdering his employer, Alfred Cranford, after a heated argument. Hose had requested time off to visit his mother, who was ill. Alfred Cranford threatened to kill Hose, and pointed a revolver at him. Hose was working at the time with an ax in his hands. Due to the threat, he defended himself and threw the ax, killing Cranford. Hose fled the scene, and the search for him began shortly thereafter. Five cash rewards were offered for his capture, including from then-Governor Allen Candler, The Atlanta Constitution, Coweta County, the town of Palmetto, and Jacob Hass of Atlanta. The police did not investigate the crime scene, gather evidence, or interview the witness. Over the next few days, furor was caused by rumors suggesting that Wilkes sexually assaulted Cranford's wife, Mattie Cranford, and assaulted his infant child. Newspapers portrayed Hose as \\"a monster in human form\\" who gleefully raped Mrs. Cranford and their infant child in front of the dying Mr. Cranford, and for good measure claimed without evidence that Hose was suffering from advanced syphilis. The police detectives investigating the crime interviewed Mrs. Cranford, who stated that after killing her husband Hose had fled, never entering her house. She also denied that she was raped, and stated no harm had come to her child. On April 23, 1899, Hose was apprehended in Marshallville, and returned by train to Coweta County.  Following events  A mob removed Hose from the train at gunpoint in Newnan, Georgia. Hose was marched to the Newnan jail, where a dispute arose between Hose's captors and the Sheriff. The captors agreed to surrender Hose to the Sheriff if they were paid their reward money. As Hose was being led by the town jailer to a cell, the mob grew alarmed, held a pistol to the jailer's head, and took Hose away. Former Governor William Yates Atkinson and Judge Alvan Freeman pleaded with the crowd to release Hose to the custody of the authorities. Ignoring their pleas, the crowd moved northward toward the Cranford home. The lynch mob grew, reaching an estimated 500 individuals, though some accounts purport around 2000. Once news of the capture reached Atlanta, large crowds boarded trains to Newnan. Mistakenly believing that these trains were loaded with troops, the mob stopped just north of Newnan, deciding they could wait no longer. = Lynching = Hose was brought to a patch of land known as the old Troutman field. Newspapers reported that members of the mob used knives to sever Hose's ears, fingers and genitals while others plunged knives repeatedly into his body, to cheers from the mob. Men and boys gathered kindling from the nearby woods to create a pyre. The skin from Hose's face was removed and he was doused with kerosene. He was then chained to a pine tree. Several matches were thrown onto the pyre by members of the mob, lighting it on fire and burning Hose alive. The heat from the fire caused Hose's veins to rupture, while his eyes nearly burst from their sockets. One journalist present noted the crowd watched \\"with unfeigned satisfaction\\" at contortions of Hose's body. As the flames consumed his body, Hose screamed out \\"Oh my God! Oh Jesus!\\" From the time of Hose's first injuries to his death, almost 30 minutes passed. One woman thanked God for the actions of the mob. Some members of the mob cut off pieces of his dead body as souvenirs. Pieces of Hose's bones were sold for 25 cents, while his heart and liver were cut out to be sold. None of the lynch mob wore masks and did not seek to hide their identities, giving their names to journalists who were present. On the tree where Hose had died, a sign was attached reading \\"We Must Protect Our Southern Women\\" One white Southern woman objected, a Mrs. P.H. Mell of Atlanta, who proudly noted in her letter to the editor of the Atlanta Constitution that she was a member of the Daughters of the Confederacy, and spoke of her horror about what was done to Hose, urging white women to protest the \\"unparalleled brutality\\" committed in the name of protecting them. Another woman, Rebecca Felton, wrote a letter protesting against Mell's letter, saying that any \\"true-hearted husband or father\\" would have done the same to the \\"beast\\" Hose, arguing that Hose needed to be killed in the same way that a mad dog needed to be put down, except \\"the dog is more worthy of sympathy\\". According to Philip Dray's At the Hands of Persons Unknown: The Lynching of Black America, the noted civil rights leader and scholar W. E. B. Du Bois, who lived in Atlanta at the time, was on his way to a scheduled meeting with Atlanta Constitution editor Joel Chandler Harris to discuss the lynching, when he was informed that Hose's knuckles were for sale in a grocery store on the road on which he was walking. He turned around and did not meet with Harris after learning this. Du Bois had until then believed that lynching was an aberrant phenomenon, and that he could use reason and a sense of fairness to appeal to the majority of the white community. The spectacular nature of Hose's lynching and the sale of body parts convinced him otherwise. The governor of Georgia, Allan D. Candler, issued a statement calling the murder of Alfred Cranford \\"the most diabolical in the annals of crime\\" and blamed the entire black community of Georgia. Candler complained the younger generation of blacks had not been so \\"lucky\\" to have experienced slavery while the older generation of blacks had failed to pass on the right values. Without presenting any proof, Candler argued the entire black community were responsible for Hose's actions and accused black citizens of hiding and sheltering him during the manhunt. Candler ended his statement by saying that it was \\"deplorable\\" that the blacks had protested the lynching of Hose.  Post-lynching investigation  The actions of the lynch mob were condemned throughout most of the United States and Europe. A group of prominent citizens in Chicago, led by journalist and activist Ida B. Wells-Barnett, hired detective Louis P. Le Vin to investigate the Hose lynching. Le Vin's entire report was published in Chapter IV of the Ida B. Wells-Barnett article, Lynch Law in Georgia. Le Vin stated that he spent over one week in his investigation. He concluded that Hose acted in self-defense, and whites added the rape allegation to incite a lynching. Le Vin stated that his conclusions were gathered from interviews with \\"persons he met in Griffin, Newman [sic], Atlanta and the vicinity\\". He does not provide the name of any individual who provided information, probably because of their fear of reprisals for speaking out publicly. He stated that he was unable to speak to Mattie Cranford, because she \\"was still suffering from the awful shock\\". Le Vin's report stated \\"that Wilkes killed Cranford there is no doubt, but under what circumstances can never be proven\\". Le Vin concluded his report with the statement, \\"I made my way home thoroughly convinced that a Negro's life is a very cheap thing in Georgia\\". In Lynch Law in Georgia, he stated: Historian Leon Litwack states, in Trouble In Mind: Black Southerners in the Age of Jim Crow, that during an investigation by a white detective, separate from the investigation organized by Wells-Barnett, Cranford's wife Mattie revealed that Hose had never entered the house, and had acted in self-defense against her husband. The memory of the lynching In February 2007, Richard Rusk who had founded the Moore's Ford Memorial Committee to commemorate the Moore's Ford lynchings was contacted by a group called Come to the Table in Newnan, Georgia that wanted to commemorate Hose's lynching.Arnold, Edwin What Virtue There Is in Fire: Cultural Memory and the Lynching of Sam Hose, Atlanta: University of Georgia Press, 2012 page 195 Rusk had led an effort to commemorate the Moore's Ford lynchings by applying for a Georgia historical marker to be placed at the site of the lynching. The Georgia Historical Society erected a historical marker in 1999, the first historical marker in Georgia--and one of the first in the country-- to document a lynching. Come to the Table were hoping Rusk could help them do the same at the site of Hose's lynching. To raise public interest, Rusk spoke to a journalist, Winston Skinner, from the Newnan Times-Herald. Rusk later stated about the article: \\"I expected they would run it inside the paper on the fifth or sixth page. Instead, it was a front page article. When I expressed my surprise, they told me anything to do with Sam Hose was a front page story\\".Arnold, Edwin What Virtue There Is in Fire: Cultural Memory and the Lynching of Sam Hose, Atlanta: University of Georgia Press, 2012 page 196 Rusk suggested a memorial service to honor Hose, saying: \\"We hope something good will come after so many years by paying our respects to Sam Hose\\". The article Newnan Times-Herald on 6 February 2007 started off a firestorm of controversy in Newnan, attracting a flood of highly negative letters to the editor calling Hose a murderer and rapist who was justly lynched by the white community of Newnan. Rusk felt Skinner was responsible for the backlash, noting that he had omitted from the article the part in the interview which he stated that Hose was probably innocent and instead presented it as a fact that Hose was guilty of the crimes of which he was accused of. In his article, Skinner wrote: \\"On 12th of April 1899, Hose hit his employer in the head with ax, killing him. He then raped the landowner's wife and injured their infant child\\". Rusk felt that there were mitigating circumstances for Hose killing Cranford and that Hose was innocent of the charges of rape. In response, Skinner replied to Rusk that in Newnan it was accepted as fact that Hose was a murderer and rapist and it was disrespectful to the Cranford family to present the story any other way. A number of white residents of Newnan wrote letters objecting to the memorial service, with one letter writer calling it Rusk's proposed service \\"shameful\\". One letter writer wrote: \\"I am amazed there are plans to have a memorial service to show respect and honor Sam Hose, the man who raped and murdered his way across our country many years ago...The group proposing to hold this memorial service should be truly ashamed\\".Arnold, Edwin What Virtue There Is in Fire: Cultural Memory and the Lynching of Sam Hose, Atlanta: University of Georgia Press, 2012 page 196-197 One white woman wrote: \\"A man who is an ax murderer and a rapist, and whose crimes were described as some of the most violent, needs to be lynched. I don't care about race, sex, orientation, etc, etc. In fact, maybe if the judicial system actually carried out punishments for crimes committed, there might be one person who thinks twice about crimes instead of looking forward to a cushy life in prison with three squares, cable TV, exercise equipment, libraries and steaks. Why doesn't this group not seek to honor someone who was just a good, decent person instead of someone who obviously got what he deserved?\\"Arnold, Edwin What Virtue There Is in Fire: Cultural Memory and the Lynching of Sam Hose, Atlanta: University of Georgia Press, 2012 page 197 Another letter writer wrote that while Hose did not receive fair treatment stated: \\"Lack of fair legal system treatment...is in no way an obligation to 'pay our respects to Sam Hose'. If we start paying respect to murderers and rapists, then we need to do the same for the late Jeffrey Dahmer, Ted Bundy and John Wayne Gacey\\". Judge John Herbert Cranford, a descendant of Alfred Cranford, issued a public statement condemning the lynching, but also expressed much anger at Rusk for not paying enough attention to his family's suffering. One letter writer took a contrary position to the majority, saying the Moore's Ford Memorial Committee should be \\"commended\\" for its work, and concluded: \\"To ignore the past or sweep it under the rug is what keeps people from getting together in harmony and amity...The bottom line is that addressing an old wrong is the right thing to do\\". Rusk in a letter to the editor of the Newnan Times-Herald argued for a public discussion rather than a memorial service for Hose, writing: \\"One of the more unfortunate aspects of lynching in Georgia and elsewhere is that many of those killed were innocent of any crime. Hose may indeed be one of the exceptions. On several issues many of us can agree. One- whether innocent or guilty, no man deserved to die like Sam Hose. Number two- little lasting good will be achieved if any of the effort to revisit this horrific event in Newnan is cooked up primarily by 'outsiders'...Do wounds like Hose's killing really heal by leaving them alone? Or if unaddressed, do they just fester away?\\"Arnold, Edwin \\"Across the Road from the Barbecue House\\" pages 267-292 from The Mississippi Quarterly, Volume 61, No. 1/2, Winter- Spring 2008. page 286 Rusk drove to Newnan himself to meet with members of Come to the Table, where he argued that most of the white people in Newnan knew only a very biased version about the lynching of Hose and believed that the effort to honor him was a way to defame their town's reputation.\\" On 23 April 2007, Rusk spoke at a meeting at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Newnan about the lynching. In his speech Rusk stated the Hose lynching was different from the Moore's Ford lynching as Hose had no descendants to champion his memory while the Cranford family were still well respected and known in Newnan, making it more difficult to honor Hose as a victim of injustice. The historian Edwin Arnold, who himself is from Coweta County, noted that even today there is no marker at the place where Hose was killed to commemorate the event.Arnold, Edwin What Virtue There Is in Fire: Cultural Memory and the Lynching of Sam Hose, Atlanta: University of Georgia Press, 2012 page 202  References   External links  Category:1870s births Category:1899 deaths Category:1899 murders in the United States Category:April 1899 events Category:False allegations of sex crimes Category:History of Georgia (U.S. state) Category:People murdered in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Lynching deaths in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Racially motivated violence against African Americans Category:Murdered African-American people Category:American torture victims Category:1899 in Georgia (U.S. state) ","title":"Lynching of Sam Hose"},{"id":"288371","text":"Stephen Joseph Cannell (; February 5, 1941 ‚Äì September 30, 2010) was an American television producer, writer, novelist, and occasional actor, and the founder of Cannell Entertainment (formerly Stephen J.

Cannell\\" At UO, he joined the Sigma Chi fraternity. \\"STEPHEN CANNELL ‚Äô64: Famed producer ruled the television airwaves with crime shows featuring quirky characters\\" Career After college, Cannell spent four years working with the family business before selling his first script to the Universal series It Takes a Thief in 1968. He was quickly hired by the television production branch of Universal Studios and was soon freelance writing for such other crime shows as Ironside and Columbo. Not long afterward, he received a telephone call from friend Herman Saunders who was the producer on the series Adam-12. They needed a script right away and Saunders asked if Stephen would be interested in writing it. He delivered what they wanted in one day, his first full-time gig, and was soon hired as story editor of Jack Webb's police series Adam-12, then in its fourth season (1971‚Äì1972). Cannell created or co- created nearly 40 television series, mostly crime dramas, including The Rockford Files, Chase, Baa Baa Black Sheep, Baretta, City of Angels, and under his own banner, The Greatest American Hero, The A-Team, Hardcastle and McCormick, Wiseguy, 21 Jump Street, Silk Stalkings, and The Commish. In the process, he had by his own count, scripted more than 450 episodes, and produced or executive produced over 1,500 episodes.Cannell.com: Bio (official site) He described his early financial arrangements in a 2002 interview, saying that at Universal, In 1979, Cannell left Universal and formed his own company, Stephen J. Cannell Productions. For the first few years, Cannell's office was located on the lot at Paramount Studios in Hollywood, though his earlier work at Universal was still distributed by MCA-Universal. Cannell's first series under his new banner was Tenspeed and Brown Shoe, and was soon followed by The Greatest American Hero, The Quest, The A-Team, Hardcastle and McCormick, Riptide, and Hunter. Cannell offices relocated to larger facilities on Hollywood Blvd in 1983. Cannell also acted occasionally, including a recurring role as main antagonist \\"Dutch\\" Dixon on his series Renegade. He also took a turn in an episode of Silk Stalkings, in which the script called for one character to tell him, \\"You look just like that writer on TV,\\" to which Cannell's character responds, \\"I get that all the time.\\" He also served as the host of the 1991‚Äì92 series Scene of the Crime a mystery anthology series with a repertory cast, 1995‚Äì1996 syndicated documentary series U.S. Customs Classified, focusing on the work of the U.S Customs Service.Brooks, Tim and Marsh, Earle, The Complete Directory to Prime Time Network and Cable TV Shows, 1946‚Äìpresent ‚Äì Ninth Edition, p. 1448, Ballantine Books, 2007, Cannell appeared as himself in the pilot of the ABC show Castle and again in season two. Along with James Patterson, Dennis Lehane, and Michael Connelly, he was one of Castle's poker buddies. In season three, following Cannell's death, an empty seat at the poker table is described as Cannell's, and remains empty for a full year in tribute to him. In 1987, and with a favorable exchange rate between the US and Canadian dollars being a win/win for US producers, Cannell decided to shoot his new series Stingray in Toronto. So many producers were shooting in Toronto that no crews were available to man any additional productions. Cannell shot seven episodes of Stingray in Calgary with the remainder being shot in Vancouver. His first series shot there was 21 Jump Street, the highest-rated show of the new Fox network's first season. With more and more series being shot in Vancouver, Cannell said, \\"We were fighting with everybody for locations and stage space\\". His solution was to build a new, state-of-the-art facility, \\"The North Shore Studios\\" on 13 acres with one hundred thousand square feet of office space and seven sound stages. The series 21 Jump Street was soon followed by Wiseguy, The Commish, Booker, Hawkeye, Cobra, The Hat Squad, J.J. Starbuck, Stingray, Street Justice, and Unsub, and a number of television films were also shot in Vancouver by Cannell's production company. In May 1988, Cannell was a panelist in the John Davidson edition of Hollywood Squares. On July 31, 1995, New World Communications acquired his Cannell Entertainment production company. Cannell then founded the Cannell Studios.Thompson, Robert J. Cannell, Stephen J.. Museum of Broadcast Communications One of the first shows produced by the newly established Cannell Studios was the short-lived but critically acclaimed corporate drama Profit. Starting in 1995, Cannell turned his attention to writing novels. His first novel, The Plan, was released in 1997 by Avon. As of 2010, he had written 18, 11 of which featured the character of detective Shane Scully of the Los Angeles Police Department. Seven are stand-alone novels. The last in the series, Vigiliante, was released December 2011 by St. Martin's Press. The 2009 documentary Dislecksia: The Movie features an interview with Cannell, in which he discusses his struggles with dyslexia and how he managed to be such a successful writer despite his difficulties reading. During the interview, he mentions how he used to hire typists to overcome his \\"spelling problem\\", as he refers to his dyslexia, but also describes how he feels his condition has enriched his life. Cannell's TV series The A-Team was remade into a 2010 feature-length film. Cannell served as a producer and creative consultant for the project. His other series 21 Jump Street was made into a 2012 feature by Columbia Pictures and Metro Goldwyn Mayer, and into the sequel 22 Jump Street, which was released in June 2014. He won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series in 1978 for The Rockford Files. In March 2020, the Cannell estate signed a worldwide distribution deal with Shout! Factory.https://deadline.com/2020/03/stephen-j-cannell-rights-tv-series-shout- factory-1202879068 Personal life Cannell married his high school sweetheart, Marcia, in 1964.

This tragedy had occurred during the filming of the \\"Captain Bellybuster\\" episode of The Greatest American Hero. Actor William Katt (an expert musician) wrote a song for Cannell, titled, \\"Cody the Cowboy\\". Cannell was so touched by this gift that he named his next son Cody in honor of the song. Cannell was dyslexic, and was a spokesman on the subject. According to an episode of Paul Harvey's The Rest of the Story, Cannell frequently had to dictate ideas or even complete scripts with the help of his personal secretary Grace Curcio, an employee of 20 years. Following Grace's retirement in 2003, Kathy Ezso became his editor and executive assistant. He discussed his experiences as a dyslexic in the 2009 documentary Dislecksia: The Movie. Cannell wrote on a typewriter, an IBM Selectric, when not dictating to an assistant, and only used a computer for research purposes. Cannell died on September 30, 2010, from complications of melanoma. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in the Hollywood Hills of Los Angeles.

Although all former Hibernia branches have been re-branded as Capital One, this building's historic name and signage remain unaltered. Hibernia National Bank was a bank headquartered in New Orleans, Louisiana. The bank was the primary subsidiary of Hibernia Corporation, a bank holding company. In November 2005, the bank was acquired by Capital One. Hibernia is the classical Latin name for Ireland. The logo of the bank included a harp, the national symbol of Ireland. History In April 1870, 3 Irish businessmen co-founded the Hibernia Bank & Trust Company in New Orleans. Patrick Irwin was named the first President, Hugh McCloskey, the first Vice-President, and Thomas Fitzwilliam, first Secretary. In September 1870, the bank began operations. In 1973, the board of directors hired 38-year-old Martin C. Miler, formerly an executive at First Union, to be the bank's president and chairman. In 1975, the Louisiana legislature approved multi-parish banking. By 1983, Hibernia grew to be the largest bank in the state in terms of assets. Despite its operations in Louisiana, the bank never lent heavily to the petroleum industry. In 1989, the bank entered Texas via the acquisition of First State Bank of Pflugerville, which was shut down by regulators as a result of bank failure. In 1990, the bank acquired BancTexas after it also failed. The bank had positive growth every quarter from 1973 to 1990; however, in 1990, as a result of the savings and loan crisis, the bank reported a loss, eliminated its dividend and needed capital. In 1991, Miler retired. In 1992, the company sold its operations in Texas to Comerica for $63.1 million in cash. The company also recapitalized by giving Chase Manhattan Bank a majority ownership stake in the company in exchange for debt forgiveness. In 2000, the company entered the insurance business with the acquisition of The Rosenthal Agency. In 2003, the company re-entered the Texas market with the acquisition of Coastal Bancorp. The company also announced plans to open additional branches in Texas. In November 2005, Capital One acquired the company. The acquisition price was re-negotiated downward after Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans.

History The former Maryland National Bank, once the largest banking chain in Maryland, originated as the Baltimore Trust Company in the early 1900s. It later was challenged by the expenses and problems from the building of its landmark iconic art deco- style skyscraper of red brick, masonry, and limestone trim, headquarters in downtown Baltimore at 10 Light Street between East Redwood (formerly German Street before World War I) and East Baltimore Streets. The new BTC Building which immediately became the tallest building in Baltimore and Maryland, surpassing the neighboring Citizens National Bank to the south, was begun in 1924 and completed in 1929, just before the avalanche of economic disaster, unemployment and the now deepening Great Depression in the early 1930s following the Wall Street Crash of 1929. After a series of reorganizations during the \\"New Deal\\" administration of 32nd President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his bank holiday in 1933, shortly after taking office in March, the bank was reorganized as the Maryland National Bank. Maryland National's parent bank holding company, MNC Financial, began offering credit cards in the 1960s. In the early 1980s, Maryland banks lobbied the Maryland General Assembly for legislation to permit higher interest rates on credit-card charges, but lawmakers refused. The neighboring state of Delaware, by contrast, had removed interest-rate restrictions in 1981. When Maryland failed to do the same, MNC Financial moved its credit-card business across the state line. MBNA was founded in 1982 as Maryland Bank, N.A. Led by Charles Cawley, MBNA opened its first office in a converted A&P; (Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Company) food supermarket in Ogletown, Delaware. An early driver of MBNA's growth was the creation of \\"affinity cards\\" in 1983. Cawley convinced the alumni association at his alma mater, Georgetown University, to allow MBNA to issue credit cards branded with the university's name. This proved to be a successful business, and other affinity affiliations with universities, organizations, and sports teams followed; by 2004, MBNA had more than 5,400 partnerships, making up about 85% of the affinity-card market. In 1989, Maryland Bank was renamed MBNA America Bank. In 1991, MBNA Corp. spun off from Maryland National and became an independent company. Businessman Al Lerner, a major investor and chairman of Maryland National since 1989, was the new MBNA's largest stockholder and chairman. Lerner became a multi-billionaire and purchased the Cleveland Browns franchise of the National Football League in 1998. He served as chairman of MBNA until his death in 2002. Maryland National was acquired by NationsBank in 1993. As MBNA grew, it became one of the most profitable companies in the United States, the world's largest independent credit card issuer, and the largest private-sector employer in Delaware. In 1995, MBNA moved its headquarters from a suburban location to Rodney Square in downtown Wilmington, Delaware. This investment was credited with helping to revive Wilmington's downtown real estate market. Historically, many MBNA executives were former employees of the FBI.Havill, Adrian. \\"Epilogue.\\" Robert Philip Hanssen: The Spy who Stayed out in the Cold. Crime Library. Retrieved on June 10, 2014. p. 15 . \\"Following Mueller's appointment, the disgraced Louis Freeh joined a Delaware credit card company, MBNA. Many of the firm's executives are former FBI employees.\\" Mergers and acquisitions On June 30, 2005, MBNA announced that it was being acquired by Bank of America for stock and cash totaling more than $35 billion, and the deal was closed on January 1, 2006. The acquisition resulted in MBNA being renamed to \\"Bank of America Card Services\\" while still based in Delaware. For the first part of 2006, MBNA still issued credit cards under its own name associated with Mastercard, VISA, and American Express, but by the second half of 2006, all credit card products were re-branded as Bank of America rather than MBNA. At the same time in June 2005, MBNA bought Loans.co.uk (LCUK), then the United Kingdom's leading finance broker. Although figures were never released, various media outlets including newspapers in Watford, where Loans.co.uk was based, reported the deal made founders David Cowham and Steve Hayes worth ¬£100m. MBNA/Bank of America later decided to close Loans.co.uk. On January 1, 2006, MBNA merged with and into Bank of America. MBNA America Bank, National Association, (MBNA) then became a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of America. On June 10, 2006, MBNA changed its name to FIA Card Services, National Association (FIA), which is not an acronym. On October 20, 2006, Bank of America, National Association (USA), a subsidiary of Bank of America Corporation, merged with and into FIA. This purchase was a reunion of sorts. In 1993, NationsBank (formerly NCNB, and originally North Carolina National Bank) bought MNC Financial (whose credit card division was spun off years earlier to become MBNA). Five years later, the Bank of America that exists today was the result of the merger between the San Francisco-based Bank of America and the Charlotte-based NationsBank. When Bank of America bought MBNA, it was in effect reuniting MNC Financial's credit card portfolio to its original banking assets and combining the Bank of America credit card portfolio with MBNA's. Employing more than 25,800 people around the world at the time of the merger with Bank of America, MBNA owned or managed more than $122.5 billion in outstanding consumer credit loans. Most of this loan debt was held in securitized portfolios that had been sold to other entities such as insurance companies and pension funds. MBNA virtually invented the process for securitizing credit card debt and this process contributed significantly to the fast growth of the company. It allowed for increasing the amount loaned without having to acquire matching assets to offset the loans. In Canada and Europe, the MBNA name was retained. MBNA Europe headquarters is in Chester, England. MBNA Canada's headquarters is located in Ottawa. In 2007, the Canadian division was named one of Canada's Top 100 Employers. On August 15, 2011, MBNA announced that the Toronto-Dominion Bank would be purchasing MBNA's Canadian MasterCard portfolio. The acquisition of MBNA Canada by TD, which was completed on December 1, 2011, saw TD become a dual credit issuer (both Visa and MasterCard), become Canada's largest MasterCard issuer, and one of Canada's largest credit issuing banks. In January 2013, Virgin Money agreed to buy ¬£1 billion of assets from MBNA, namely the Virgin Credit Card assets which MBNA had serviced and managed in partnership with Virgin Money since 2002. The former Vice Chairman of MBNA Corporation, Lance Weaver, became Virgin Money's President of Virgin Money Cards. On December 20, 2016, Lloyds Banking Group announced that it would purchase MBNA's UK portfolio from Bank of America for ¬£1.9 billion, its first acquisition after the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008. The deal was completed on June 1, 2017 and since that time, in the United Kingdom, MBNA is a trading style of Lloyds Bank plc and is regulated in the United Kingdom by the FCA.  Controversies  MBNA hired the son of Vice President Joe Biden during the years when Biden was a Senator and was pushing for bankruptcy reform legislation supported by the company, which became law and makes it more difficult to acquire bankruptcy protection. Because of the close relationship between Biden and MBNA, an article in the conservative political magazine National Review referred to Biden as the \\"Senator from MBNA\\". MBNA was one of the companies mentioned on a 2004 Frontline WGBH Boston PBS special about unfair business practices by credit card companies.\\"Frontline: Secret History of the Credit Card\\", PBS. Some practices that Frontline claimed MBNA has engaged in included doubling or tripling of interest rates, shifting billing due dates/payment cycles monthly and raising rates for customers whose payments were a day or two late. MBNA has been found to be one of the leading implementors of rate-jacking. For further information and links, see credit card. In Ireland, MBNA was accused of calling consumers up to eight times a day who were behind in making payments, which prompted the state debt advisory service to publicly state that harassment is outlawed. Affected people were advised to complain to the relevant authorities. The company in December 2009 admitted overcharging 500,000 Irish consumers up to ‚Ç¨18 million. In the UK, MBNA has come under fire for its interpretation of rules under which credit card providers must allocate payments to the debt with the highest interest rate first: one consumer site called MBNA's interpretation of these rules a \\"disingenuous money-making tactic\\".

It was first used almost exclusively on Usenet, but has since become widespread in other forms of computer-mediated communication and even face-to-face communication. It is one of many initialisms for expressing bodily reactions, in particular laughter, as text, including initialisms for more emphatic expressions of laughter such as LMAO (\\"laugh(ing) my ass off\\") and ROFL or ROTFL (\\"roll(ing) on the floor laughing\\"). Other unrelated expansions include the now mostly obsolete \\"lots of luck\\" or \\"lots of love\\" used in letter-writing. The list of acronyms \\"grows by the month\\" (said Peter Hershock in 2003), and they are collected along with emoticons and smileys into folk dictionaries that are circulated informally amongst users of Usenet, IRC, and other forms of (textual) computer-mediated communication. These initialisms are controversial, and several authors recommend against their use, either in general or in specific contexts such as business communications. The Oxford English Dictionary first listed LOL in March, 2011. Analysis Silvio Laccetti (professor of humanities at Stevens Institute of Technology) and Scott Molski, in their essay entitled The Lost Art of Writing, are critical of the terms, predicting reduced chances of employment for students who use such slang, stating that, \\"Unfortunately for these students, their bosses will not be 'lol' when they read a report that lacks proper punctuation and grammar, has numerous misspellings, various made- up words, and silly acronyms.\\" Fondiller and Nerone in their style manual assert that \\"professional or business communication should never be careless or poorly constructed\\" whether one is writing an electronic mail message or an article for publication, and warn against the use of smileys and abbreviations, stating that they are \\"no more than e-mail slang and have no place in business communication\\". Linguist John McWhorter stated, \\"Lol is being used in a particular way. It's a marker of empathy. It's a marker of accommodation. We linguists call things like that pragmatic particles‚Ä¶\\" Pragmatic particles are the words and phrases utilized to alleviate the awkward areas in casual conversation, such as oh in \\"Oh, I don‚Äôt know\\" and uh when someone is thinking of something to say. McWhorter stated that lol is utilized less as a reaction to something that is hilarious, but rather as a way to lighten the conversation. Frank Yunker and Stephen Barry, in a study of online courses and how they can be improved through podcasting, have found that these slang terms, and emoticons as well, are \\"often misunderstood\\" by students and are \\"difficult to decipher\\" unless their meanings are explained in advance. They single out the example of \\"ROFL\\" as not obviously being the abbreviation of \\"rolling on the floor laughing\\" (emphasis added). Matt Haig singles out LOL as one of the three most popular initialisms in Internet slang, alongside BFN (\\"bye for now\\") and IMHO (\\"in my honest/humble opinion\\"). He describes the various initialisms of Internet slang as convenient, but warns that \\"as ever more obscure acronyms emerge they can also be rather confusing\\". Hossein Bidgoli likewise states that these initialisms \\"save keystrokes for the sender but [...] might make comprehension of the message more difficult for the receiver\\" and that \\"[s]lang may hold different meanings and lead to misunderstandings especially in international settings\\"; he advises that they be used \\"only when you are sure that the other person knows the meaning\\". Tim Shortis observes that ROFL is a means of \\"annotating text with stage directions\\". Peter Hershock, in discussing these terms in the context of performative utterances, points out the difference between telling someone that one is laughing out loud and actually laughing out loud: \\"The latter response is a straightforward action. The former is a self-reflexive representation of an action: I not only do something but also show you that I am doing it. Or indeed, I may not actually laugh out loud but may use the locution 'LOL' to communicate my appreciation of your attempt at humor.\\" David Crystal notes that use of LOL is not necessarily genuine, just as the use of smiley faces or grins is not necessarily genuine, posing the rhetorical question \\"How many people are actually 'laughing out loud' when they send LOL?\\". Louis Franzini concurs, stating that there is as yet no research that has determined the percentage of people who are actually laughing out loud when they write LOL. Victoria Clarke, in her analysis of telnet talkers, states that capitalization is important when people write LOL, and that \\"a user who types LOL may well be laughing louder than one who types lol\\", and opines that \\"these standard expressions of laughter are losing force through overuse\\". Michael Egan describes LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms as helpful so long as they are not overused. He recommends against their use in business correspondence because the recipient may not be aware of their meanings, and because in general neither they nor emoticons are in his view appropriate in such correspondence. June Hines Moore shares that view. So, too, does Sheryl Lindsell-Roberts, who gives the same advice of not using them in business correspondence, \\"or you won't be LOL\\". Acceptance On March 24, 2011, LOL, along with other acronyms, was formally recognized in an update of the Oxford English Dictionary. In their research, it was determined that the earliest recorded use of LOL as an initialism was for \\"little old lady\\" in the 1960s. They also discovered that the oldest written record of the use of LOL in the contemporary meaning of \\"Laughing Out Loud\\" was from a message typed by Wayne Pearson in the 1980s, from the archives of Usenet. Gabriella Coleman references \\"lulz\\" extensively in her anthropological studies of Anonymous. A 2003 study of college students by Naomi Baron found that the use of these initialisms in computer-mediated communication (CMC), specifically in instant messaging, was actually lower than she had expected. The students \\"used few abbreviations, acronyms, and emoticons\\". Out of 2,185 transmissions, there were 90 initialisms in total; 76 were occurrences of LOL. LOL, ROFL, and other initialisms have crossed from computer-mediated communication to face-to-face communication. David Crystal‚Äîlikening the introduction of LOL, ROFL, and others into spoken language in magnitude to the revolution of Johannes Gutenberg's invention of movable type in the 15th century‚Äîstates that this is \\"a brand new variety of language evolving\\", invented by young people within five years, that \\"extend[s] the range of the language, the expressiveness [and] the richness of the language\\". However Geoffrey K. Pullum argues that even if interjections such as LOL and ROFL were to become very common in spoken English, their \\"total effect on language\\" would be \\"utterly trivial\\". Variations on the theme =Variants= * lul: phonetic spelling of LOL. \\"LUL\\" is also commonly used in the gaming community, due to it being an emote on Twitch, which depicts game critic TotalBiscuit laughing. * lolz: Occasionally used in place of LOL. * lulz: Often used to denote laughter at someone who is the victim of a prank, or a reason for performing an action. Its use originated with Internet trolls. According to a New York Times article about Internet trolling, \\"lulz means the joy of disrupting another's emotional equilibrium.\\" Can be used as a noun ‚Äì e.g. \\"do it for the lulz.\\", shortened into \\"ftlulz\\" (to distinguish it from \\"ftl\\" ‚Äì \\"for the loss\\"). See also LulzSec. * LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL: For added emphasis, LOL can be appended with any number of additional iterations of \\"OL\\". In cases such as these, the abbreviation is not to be read literally (i.e., \\"Laughing out loud out loud out loud out loud\\"), but is meant to suggest several LOLs in a row. * trolololol or trollololol: A portmanteau of troll and LOL iterated. Indicates that the prank or joke was made by internet trolls, or the user thinks the prank or joke qualifies as internet trolling. See also Mr. Trololo. =Derivations= * lolwut (sometimes \\"lulwut\\"): lol + wut, used to indicate bemused laughter, or confusion. * lawl, lawlz, or lal: Pseudo-pronunciation of LOL. Saying \\"lawl\\" is sometimes meant in mockery of those who use the term LOL, and is not meant to express laughter. * lel: A satirical form of lol, often used to denote bemusement or lack of amusement in response to a statement. =Related= An animated ASCII art image popularized in 2004 by memes using the word \\"roflcopter\\" * *G* or *g*: For \\"grins\\". Like \\"lulz\\" it is used in the initialism \\"J4G\\" (\\"just for grins\\"). * kek: A term for laughter that originated in online games, possibly either World of Warcraft or Starcraft, the latter in which Korean players would type \\"kekeke\\" as onomatopoeia for laughter. It later became associated with alt-right politics, in the form of a parody religion surrounding the character Pepe the Frog by analogy with the frog-headed ancient Egyptian god Kek. * LMAO: For \\"laughing my ass off\\". Variant: LMFAO (\\"Laughing my fucking ass off\\"). * lqtm: For \\"Laughing quietly to myself\\". * ROFL: For \\"rolling on the floor laughing\\". It is often combined with LMAO for added emphasis as ROFLMAO (\\"Rolling on the floor laughing my ass off\\") or ROFLMFAO (Rolling on the floor laughing my fucking ass off). *roflcopter: A portmanteau of ROFL and helicopter. A popular glitch in the Microsoft Sam text-to-speech engine enables the voice to make a sound akin to the rotation of rotor blades when 'SOI' is entered, and the phrase 'My ROFLcopter goes soi soi soi...\\" is often associated with the term as a result. * PMSL: For \\"pissing myself laughing\\". = Commonly used equivalents in other languages = In some languages with a non-Latin script, the abbreviation LOL itself is also often transliterated. See for example Arabic ŸÑŸàŸÑ and Russian –ª–æ–ª. Pre-dating the Internet and phone texting by a century, the way to express laughter in morse code is \\"hi hi\\". The sound of this in morse ('di-di-di-dit di-dit, di-di-di-dit di-dit') is thought to represent chuckling. Most of these variants are usually found in lowercase. * 555: the Thai variation of LOL. \\"5\\" in Thai is pronounced \\"ha\\", three of them being \\"hahaha\\". * asg: Swedish abbreviation of the term asgarv, meaning intense laughter. * g: Danish abbreviation of the word griner, which means \\"laughing\\" in Danish. * ha3: Malaysian variation of LOL. ha3 means pronouncing ha three times, \\"hahaha\\". * jajaj√°: in Spanish, the letter \\"j\\" is pronounced /x/. * jejeje: in the Philippines is used to represent \\"hehehe\\". \\"j\\" in Filipino languages is pronounced as /h/, derived from the Spanish /x/. Its origins can be traced to SMS language. It is widely used in a Filipino youth subculture known as Jejemons. * kkkk: in Somali and Ethiopian languages spoken in the Horn of Africa, iterations of the letter \\"k\\", usually ranging between 2 and 8 k's, are used as a variation of LOL. These iterations are also used by Shona, Ndebele and other Zimbabwean languages speakers, with the longer variant being \\"kikiki\\" (emulating a laughing sound). * mdr: Esperanto version, from the initials of \\"multe da ridoj\\", which translates to \\"lot of laughs\\" in English. * mdr: French version, from the initials of \\"mort de rire\\" which roughly translated means \\"died of laughter\\", although many French people also use LOL instead as it is the most widely used on the internet. * mkm: in Afghanistan \\"mkm\\" (being an abbreviation of the phrase \\"ma khanda mikonom\\"). This is a Dari phrase that means \\"I am laughing\\". * ptdr: French variant from p√©t√© de rire ‚Äì literally meaning \\"broken with laughter\\" * rs: in Brazil \\"rs\\" (being an abbreviation of \\"risos\\", the plural of \\"laugh\\") is often used in text based communications in situations where in English LOL would be used, repeating it (\\"rsrsrsrsrs\\") is often done to express longer laughter or laughing harder. Also popular is \\"kkk\\" (which can also be repeated indefinitely), due to the pronunciation of the letter k in Portuguese sounding similar to the ca in card, and therefore representing the laugh \\"cacacacaca\\" (also similar to the Hebrew version above). * wkwkwk: in Indonesian, \\"wkwkwk\\" is often used to express laughter. A new variant, \\"Akwoakwoak\\" or \\"Awkwoakwoak\\" is often used beside the original version. Both the original and the new variant are derived from the sound of Donald Duck laughing, something like \\"Wakakaka\\". * ◊ó◊ó◊ó/◊î◊î◊î: Hebrew version of LOL. The letter ◊ó is pronounced [/x/ /x/] and ◊î is pronounced [/h/ /h/]. Putting them together (usually three or more in a row) makes the word khakhakha or hahaha (since vowels in Hebrew are generally not written), which is in many languages regarded as the sound of laughter. * ŸáŸáŸáŸáŸá: Arabic script repetition of the \\"ŸáŸÄ\\" character meaning \\"Hahahaha\\" or \\"Hehehehe\\". \\"ŸáŸÄ\\" is equivalent to the letter \\"H\\". The equivalents of the \\"a\\" or \\"e\\" short vowels are Arabic diacritics and are optional to write. * „Öã„Öã„Öã (\\"kkk\\" or \\"kekeke\\") and „Öé„Öé„Öé (\\"hhh\\") are usually used to indicate laughter in Korean. '„Öã', is a Korean Jamo consonant representing a \\"k\\" sound, and '„Öé' represents an \\"h\\" sound. Both \\"„Öã„Öã„Öã\\" and \\"„Öé„Öé„Öé\\" represent laughter which is not very loud. However, if a vowel symbol is written, louder laughter is implied: ÌïòÌïò \\"haha\\" Ìò∏Ìò∏, \\"hoho.\\" * ÂìàÂìàÂìà/ÂëµÂëµÂëµ: in Chinese. Although Â§ßÁ¨ë (da xiao; \\"big laugh\\") is used, a more widespread usage is \\"ÂìàÂìàÂìà\\" (ha ha ha) or \\"ÂëµÂëµÂëµ\\" () on internet forums. The phonetic rendering, \\"haha\\", is also common. * (Á¨ë): in Japanese, the kanji for laugh (Á¨ë) is used in the same way as lol. It can be read as kakko warai (literally \\"parentheses laugh\\") or just wara. w is also used as an abbreviation, and it is common for multiple w to be chained together. The resulting shape formed from multiple w leads to the usage of Ëçâ (read as kusa), due to its resemblance to the shape of grass. * –ª—ñ–ª (\\"li'l\\", \\"leel\\") is a Ukrainian variant of LOL. Originally it was a parody for Mykola Azarov language, so called \\"azirivka\\", in which all \\"o\\"s are replaced with \\"i\\". =The word lol in other languages= * In Dutch, lol is a word (not an acronym) which, coincidentally, means \\"fun\\" (\\"lollig\\" means \\"funny\\") * In Welsh, lol means \\"nonsense\\" or \\"ridiculous\\" ‚Äì e.g., if a person wanted to say \\"utter nonsense\\" in Welsh, they would say \\"lol wirion\\" or \\"rwtsh lol\\" See also * Internet meme * Leet References Further reading * * ‚Äîan early Usenet posting of a folk dictionary of abbreviations and emoticons, listing LOL and ROTFL * * Claim to first use.

A traditional market town in the heart of the Portes du Soleil, Morzine is dominated by chalets spread across a river gorge, bordered by partially wooded slopes allowing skiing in poor weather conditions. Situated at an altitude of 1000 m, it is one of the most northerly of the French Alpine resorts, and weatherwise benefits from the Mont Blanc microclimate. The locality enjoys panoramic mountain views and modern ski facilities, as well as hotels and restaurants in the town itself. The ski resort of Avoriaz is located on the territory of the commune. History In 1181, Morzine (, or \\"border area\\") was a grange of Aulps Abbey, a Cistercian monastery 7 km away.Delerce (A.), Recherches sur le chartrier d'Aulps. Reconstitution, √©dition et commentaire des chartes d'une abbaye cistercienne de montagne (1097-1307), vol. 2, p. 271-273, n¬∞ 32. Papal bull of Pope Alexander III In the Middle Ages, granges were agricultural centres from which the monks exploited their landscape and co-ordinated farming and industrial work. The grange was fundamental to the Cistercians' successful expansion and management of their mountain land. The granges supplied the monastery's food, clothing, utensils and building materials. The granges were manned by lay- brothers, who cultivated the lands and reared livestock.Willams (D. H.), The Cistercians in the Early Middle Ages, Leominster, 1998, p. 278 ss. From the 18th to the early 20th century, the exploitation of slate quarries was an important economic activity of Morzine, before winter tourism took over around in 1930.History section, Ardoisi√®re des Sept Pieds In 2015 only a few quarries were still being exploited. Summer sports Morzine also hosts summer activities such as mountain biking, golfing, walking and caving. The resort also boasts an Olympic sized swimming pool. =Mountain biking= Local trails are generally single track and with varying levels of difficulty available from steep, rooty and technical to fast open downhill tracks. There is also a small amount of Northshore available in the Chatel Bike Park area. Morzine is also within easy reach of other resorts including Avoriaz, Morgins, Ch√¢tel and Les Gets. The resorts of Pila, Verbier and Les Arcs lie within easy reach by car thus giving access to several places to ride. A single lift pass can be purchased to cover the whole of the Portes du Soleil area and costs much less than during the winter months. =Tour de France= Morzine has hosted Tour de France stage finishes on several occasions, thanks in part to the proximity of the notoriously steep Col de Joux-Plane climb. Morzine was the finale of the first mountain stage in the 2003 Tour de France. Stage seven's yellow jersey (for the leader of the general classification) and polka dot jersey (for the leader of the mountains classification) were awarded to Richard Virenque of France's Quick Step-Davitamon team. Stage 17 of the 2006 Tour de France ended in Morzine, where Floyd Landis did the impossible and gutted out one of the most memorable stage wins in Tour history during the height of the 1992-2012 doping-era. The town was also the starting point for Stage 18. In the 2010 Tour de France Morzine was the finishing location for stage 8. Morzine again featured in the 2016 Tour de France as the finish for stage 20 - Megeve to Morzine. =Football= Morzine is home to the annual French Mountain Villages Football Tournament (Tournoi des Montagnes) where the best junior teams compete for a much coveted trophy each June. Winter sports =Skiing and snowboarding= The intermediate terrain makes the area well suited to beginners and less-seasoned skiers and snowboarders, which has led to the resort being especially popular with families. However more challenging slopes can be found at nearby Avoriaz. Morzine is closely linked to its neighbours Avoriaz and Les Gets in that they function as linked skiing centres during the winter season. The two resorts are included in the Portes du Soleil ski area, which includes both French and Swiss villages. Local transport The closest airport to Morzine is Geneva Cointrin International Airport, Switzerland. Although there is no rail service directly to Morzine the two closest stations are at Thonon-les-Bains and Cluses, and from these stations local buses are available to the town.

In its early years, the organization was one among others vying to be the premiere internet awards show, most notably, the Cool Site of the Year Awards. Both shows would compare themselves to the Oscars, as did media outlets such as The New York Times to Canada's Globe & Mail. The winners of the First Annual Webby Awards in 1995 were presented by John Brancato and Michael Ferris, writers for Columbia Pictures. It was held at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel. The televised Webby Awards began in 1996, sponsored by the Academy of Web Design and Cool Site of the Day. The first Webby Awards were produced by Kay Dangaard at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel as a nod to the first site of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Oscars). That first year, they were called \\"Webbie\\" Awards. The first \\"Site of the Year\\" winner was the pioneer webisodic serial The Spot. Today's Webby Awards were founded by Tiffany Shlain, a filmmaker, when she was hired by The Web Magazine to re-establish them. The event began to be held in San Francisco in 1996, quickly became known for its requirement that winners give their acceptance speeches in five words. After the first year, the awards became more successful than the magazine and IDG closed the publication. Shlain continued to run The Webby Awards with the help of Maya Draisin until 2004.

The Niue Constitution Act 1974 is the supreme law of Niue; any other Niue law that is inconsistent with the Niue Constitution Act 1974 will be deemed to be invalid. Its granting by the New Zealand Parliament in 1974 is celebrated yearly as Niue's independence on \\"Constitution Day\\" on 19 October. The road towards self-government for Niue started with the UN Decolonisation Committee putting pressure on New Zealand for Niue to decide what form of status Niue wanted. The people of Niue voted in 1974 choosing the self-government option as the best direction for Niue. The Niue Constitution is the legal doctrine that put the wishes of the Niue people for self-government into practice. Self-government allows for Niueans to lead and take charge of their own affairs; this has reduced the number of New Zealand expats working in key Government positions from around 20 in 1974 to none at the moment. The Niue Constitution requires 2/3 majority in the three readings in the Legislative Assembly and also requires 2/3 support from the electors before it can be amended.

Provenance (from the French provenir, 'to come from/forth') is the chronology of the ownership, custody or location of a historical object.OED: \\"The fact of coming from some particular source or quarter; source, derivation\\" The term was originally mostly used in relation to works of art but is now used in similar senses in a wide range of fields, including archaeology, paleontology, archives, manuscripts, printed books, the circular economy, and science and computing. The primary purpose of tracing the provenance of an object or entity is normally to provide contextual and circumstantial evidence for its original production or discovery, by establishing, as far as practicable, its later history, especially the sequences of its formal ownership, custody and places of storage. The practice has a particular value in helping authenticate objects. Comparative techniques, expert opinions and the results of scientific tests may also be used to these ends, but establishing provenance is essentially a matter of documentation. The term dates to the 1780s in English. Provenance is conceptually comparable to the legal term chain of custody. For museums and the art trade, in addition to helping establish the authorship and authenticity of an object, provenance has become increasingly important in helping establish the moral and legal validity of a chain of custody, given the increasing amount of looted art. These issues first became a major concern regarding works that had changed hands in Nazi-controlled areas in Europe before and during World War II. Many museums began compiling pro-active registers of such works and their history. Recently the same concerns have come to prominence for works of African art, often exported illegally, and antiquities from many parts of the world, but currently especially in Iraq, and then Syria.\\"Better Safe Than Sorry: American Museums Take Measures Mindful of Repatriation of African Art\\", by Robin Scher, Art News, 11 June 2019 In archaeology and paleontology, the derived term provenience is used with a related but very particular meaning, to refer to the location (in modern research, recorded precisely in three dimensions) where an artifact or other ancient item was found. Provenance covers an object's complete documented history. An artifact may thus have both a provenience and a provenance. Works of art and antiques The provenance of works of fine art, antiques and antiquities is of great importance, especially to their owner. There are a number of reasons why painting provenance is important, which mostly also apply to other types of fine art. A good provenance increases the value of a painting, and establishing provenance may help confirm the date, artist and, especially for portraits, the subject of a painting. It may confirm whether a painting is genuinely of the period it seems to date from. The provenance of paintings can help resolve ownership disputes. For example, provenance between 1933 and 1945 can determine whether a painting was looted by the Nazis. Many galleries are putting a great deal of effort into researching the provenance of paintings in their collections for which there is no firm provenance during that period. Documented evidence of provenance for an object can help to establish that it has not been altered and is not a forgery, a reproduction, stolen or looted art. Provenance helps assign the work to a known artist, and a documented history can be of use in helping to prove ownership. An example of a detailed provenance is given in the Arnolfini portrait. The quality of provenance of an important work of art can make a considerable difference to its selling price in the market; this is affected by the degree of certainty of the provenance, the status of past owners as collectors, and in many cases by the strength of evidence that an object has not been illegally excavated or exported from another country. The provenance of a work of art may vary greatly in length, depending on context or the amount that is known, from a single name to an entry in a scholarly catalogue some thousands of words long. An expert certification can mean the difference between an object having no value and being worth a fortune. Certifications themselves may be open to question. Jacques van Meegeren forged the work of his father Han van Meegeren (who in his turn had forged the work of Vermeer). Jacques sometimes produced a certificate with his forgeries stating that a work was created by his father. John Drewe was able to pass off as genuine paintings, a large number of forgeries that would have easily been recognised as such by scientific examination. He established an impressive (but false) provenance and because of this galleries and dealers accepted the paintings as genuine. He created this false provenance by forging letters and other documents, including false entries in earlier exhibition catalogues. Sometimes provenance can be as simple as a photograph of the item with its original owner. Simple yet definitive documentation such as that can increase its value by an order of magnitude, but only if the owner was of high renown. Many items that were sold at auction have gone far past their estimates because of a photograph showing that item with a famous person. Some examples include antiques owned by politicians, musicians, artists, actors, etc. =Researching the provenance of paintings= Sir William Petre, 1567: artist unknown. By the turn of the 17th century, this portrait was in the collection of John, 1st Baron Lumley, a fact indicated by the cartellino added to the painting at upper right. It is now in the National Portrait Gallery, London The objective of provenance research is to produce a complete list of owners (together, where possible, with the supporting documentary proof) from when the painting was commissioned or in the artist's studio through to the present time. In practice, there are likely to be gaps in the list and documents that are missing or lost. The documented provenance should also list when the painting has been part of an exhibition and a bibliography of when it has been discussed (or illustrated) in print. Where the research is proceeding backwards, to discover the previous provenance of a painting whose current ownership and location is known, it is important to record the physical details of the painting ‚Äì style, subject, signature, materials, dimensions, frame, etc.Reynolds, Lisa, An Art Provenance Research Guide available at University of North Carolina Master's Papers The titles of paintings and the attribution to a particular artist may change over time. The size of the work and its description can be used to identify earlier references to the painting. The back of a painting can contain significant provenance information. There may be exhibition marks, dealer stamps, gallery labels and other indications of previous ownership. There may also be shipping labels. In the BBC TV programme Fake or Fortune? the provenance of the painting Bords de la Seine √† Argenteuil was investigated using a gallery sticker and shipping label on the back. Early provenance can sometimes be indicated by a cartellino (a trompe-l'≈ìil representation of an inscribed label) added to the front of a painting. However, these can be forged, or can fade or be painted over. Auction records are an important resource to assist in researching the provenance of paintings. *The Witt Library houses a collection of cuttings from auction catalogs which enables the researcher to identify occasions when a picture has been sold. *The Heinz Library at the National Portrait Gallery, London maintains a similar collection, but restricted to portraits. *The National Art Library at the Victoria and Albert Museum has a collection of UK sales catalogues. *The University of York is establishing a web site with on-line resources for investigating art history in the period 1660‚Äì1735. This includes diaries, sales catalogues, bills, correspondence and inventories. *The Getty Research Institute in Los Angeles has a Project for the Study of Collecting and Provenance (PSCP) which includes an on-line database, still being compiled, of auction and other records relating to painting provenance. *The Frick Art Reference Library in New York has an extensive collection of auction and exhibition catalogues. *The Netherlands Institute for Art History (RKD) has a number of databases related to artists from the Netherlands. If a painting has been in private hands for an extended period and on display in a stately home, it may be recorded in an inventory ‚Äì for example, the Lumley inventory.Dynasties, a catalogue of an exhibition at the Tate Gallery, Karen Hearn, page 158 The painting may also have been noticed by a visitor who subsequently wrote about it. It may have been mentioned in a will or a diary. Where the painting has been bought from a dealer, or changed hands in a private transaction, there may be a bill of sale or sales receipt that provides evidence of provenance. Where the artist is known, there may be a catalogue raisonn√© listing all the artist's known works and their location at the time of writing. A database of catalogues raisonn√©s is available at the International Foundation for Art Research. Historic photos of the painting may be discussed and illustrated in a more general work on the artist, period or genre. Similarly, a photograph of a painting may show inscriptions (or a signature) that subsequently became lost as a result of overzealous restoration. Conversely, a photograph may show that an inscription was not visible at an earlier date. One of the disputed aspects of the \\"Rice\\" portrait of Jane Austen concerns apparent inscriptions identifying artist and sitter. Archives Stamp on a historic document, showing that it has passed through the hands of the Records Preservation Section of the British Records Association, a rescue service for archival material: the number indicates its earlier provenance Provenance ‚Äì also known as \\"custodial history\\" ‚Äì is a core concept within archival science and archival processing. The term refers to the individuals, groups, or organizations that originally created or received the items in an accumulation of records, and to the items' subsequent chain of custody. The principle of provenance (also termed the principle of \\"archival integrity\\", and a major strand in the broader principle of respect des fonds) stipulates that records originating from a common source (or fonds) should be kept together ‚Äì where practicable, physically; but in all cases intellectually, in the way in which they are catalogued and arranged in finding aids. Conversely, records of different provenance should be preserved and documented separately. In archival practice, proof of provenance is provided by the operation of control systems that document the history of records kept in archives, including details of amendments made to them. The authority of an archival document or set of documents of which the provenance is uncertain (because of gaps in the recorded chain of custody) will be considered to be severely compromised. The principles of archival provenance were developed in the 19th century by both French and Prussian archivists, and gained widespread acceptance on the basis of their formulation in the Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives by Dutch state archivists Samuel Muller, J. A. Feith, and R. Fruin, published in the Netherlands in 1898 (often referred to as the \\"Dutch Manual\\"). Seamus Ross has argued a case for adapting established principles and theories of archival provenance to the field of modern digital preservation and curation. Provenance is also the title of the journal published by the Society of Georgia Archivists. Books In the case of books, the study of provenance refers to the study of the ownership of individual copies of books. It is usually extended to include study of the circumstances in which individual copies of books have changed ownership, and of evidence left in books that shows how readers interacted with them. Provenance studies may shed light on the books themselves, providing evidence of the role particular titles have played in social, intellectual and literary history. Such studies may also add to our knowledge of particular owners of books. For instance, looking at the books owned by a writer may help to show which works influenced him or her. Many provenance studies are historically focused, and concentrated on books owned by writers, politicians and public figures. The recent ownership of books is studied, however, as is evidence of how ordinary or anonymous readers have interacted with books. Provenance can be studied both by examining the books themselves (for instance looking at inscriptions, marginalia, bookplates, book rhymes, and bindings) and by reference to external sources of information such as auction catalogues. Wines In transactions of old wine with the potential of improving with age, the issue of provenance has a large bearing on the assessment of the contents of a bottle, both in terms of quality and the risk of wine fraud. A documented history of wine cellar conditions is valuable in estimating the quality of an older vintage due to the fragile nature of wine.winepros.com.au. Recent technology developments have aided collectors in assessing the temperature and humidity history or the wine which are two key components in establishing perfect provenance. For example, there are devices available that rest inside the wood case and can be read through the wood by waving a smartphone equipped with a simple app. These devices track the conditions the case has been exposed to for the duration of the battery life, which can be as long as 15 years, and sends a graph and high/low readings to the smartphone user. This takes the trust issue out of the hands of the owner and gives it to a third party for verification. Science =Archaeology, anthropology, and paleontology= Archaeology and anthropology researchers use provenience to refer to the exact location or find spot of an artifact, a bone or other remains, a soil sample, or a feature within an ancient site, whereas provenance covers an object's complete documented history. Ideally, in modern excavations, the provenience is recorded in three dimensions on a site grid with great precision, and may also be recorded on video to provide additional proof and context. In older work, often undertaken by amateurs, only the general site or approximate area may be known, especially when an artifact was found outside a professional excavation and its specific position not recorded. The term provenience appeared in the 1880s, about a century after provenance. Outside of academic contexts, it has been used as a synonymous variant spelling of provenance, especially in American English. Any given antiquity may have both a provenience (where it was found) and a provenance (where it has been since it was found). A summary of the distinction is that \\"provenience is a fixed point, while provenance can be considered an itinerary that an object follows as it moves from hand to hand.\\" Another metaphor is that provenience is an artifact's \\"birthplace\\", while provenance is its \\"r√©sum√©\\", though this is imprecise (many artifacts originated as trade goods created in one region but were used and finally deposited in another). Aside from scientific precision, a need for the distinction in these fields has been described thus: In this context, the provenance can occasionally be the detailed history of where an object has been since its creation, as in art history contexts ‚Äì not just since its modern finding. In some cases, such as where there is an inscription on the object, or an account of it in written materials from the same era, an object of study in archaeology or cultural anthropology may have an early provenance ‚Äì a known history that predates modern research ‚Äì then a provenience from its modern finding, and finally a continued provenance relating to its handling and storage or display after the modern acquisition. Evidence of provenance in the more general sense can be of importance in archaeology. Fakes are not unknown, and finds are sometimes removed from the context in which they were found without documentation, reducing their value to science. Even when apparently discovered in situ, archaeological finds are treated with caution. The provenience of a find may not be properly represented by the context in which it was found (e.g. due to stratigraphic layers being disturbed by erosion, earthquakes, or ancient reconstruction or other disturbance at a site. Artifacts can also be moved through looting as well as trade, far from their place of origin and long before modern rediscovery. Further research is often required to establish the true provenance of a find, and what the relationship is between the exact provenience and the overall provenance. In paleontology and paleoanthropology, it is recognized that fossils can also move from their primary context and are sometimes found, apparently in-situ, in deposits to which they do not belong because they have been moved, for example, by the erosion of nearby but different outcrops. It is unclear how strictly paleontology maintains the provenience and provenance distinction. For example, a short glossary at a website (primarily aimed at young students) of the American Museum of Natural History treats the terms as synonymous, while scholarly paleontology works make frequent use of provenience in the same precise sense as used in archaeology and paleoanthropology. While exacting details of a find's provenience are primarily of use to scientific researchers, most natural history and archaeology museums also make strenuous efforts to record how the items in their collections were acquired. These records are often of use in helping to establish a chain of provenance. =Data provenance= Scientific research is generally held to be of good provenance when it is documented in detail sufficient to allow reproducibility.Altintas, I.; Berkley, C.; Jaeger, E.; Jones, M.; Ludascher, B.; Mock S. (2004) \\"Kepler: An extensible system for design and execution of scientific workflows\\". Proceedings of 16th International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management, pp. 423‚Äì424 Scientific workflow systems assist scientists and programmers with tracking their data through all transformations, analyses, and interpretations. Data sets are reliable when the processes used to create them are reproducible and analyzable for defects.Boose, E.; Ellison, A.; Osterweil, L.; Clarke, L.; Podorozhny, R., Hadley, J.; Wise, A.; Foster, D. (2007) Ensuring reliable datasets for environmental models and forecasts. Ecological Informatics, 2(3):237‚Äì247 Security researchers are interested in data provenance because it can analyze suspicious data and make large opaque systems transparent. Current initiatives to effectively manage, share, and reuse ecological data are indicative of the increasing importance of data provenance. Examples of these initiatives are National Science Foundation Datanet projects, DataONE and Data Conservancy, as well as the U.S. Global Change Research Program.Ma, X.; Fox, P.; Tilmes, C.; Jacobs, K.; Waple, A. (2014) Capturing and presenting provenance of global change information. Nature Climate Change 4 (6), 409-413. Some international academic consortia, such as the Research Data Alliance, have specific groups to tackle issues of provenance. In that case it is the Research Data Provenance Interest Group. =Computer science= Within computer science, informatics uses the term \\"provenance\\" to mean the lineage of data, as per data provenance, with research in the last decade extending the conceptual model of causality and relation to include processes that act on data and agents that are responsible for those processes. See, for example, the proceedings of the International Provenance Annotation Workshop (IPAW) and Theory and Practice of Provenance (TaPP). Semantic web standards bodies, including the World Wide Web Consortium in 2014, have ratified a standard data model for provenance representation known as PROV which draws from many of the better-known provenance representation systems that preceded it, such as the Proof Markup Language and the Open Provenance Model. Interoperability is a design goal of most recent computer science provenance theories and models, for example the Open Provenance Model (OPM) 2008 generation workshop aimed at \\"establishing inter- operability of systems\\" through information exchange agreements.Moreau et al. (2008) The Open Provenance Model: An Overview, in J. Freire, D. Koop, and L. Moreau (Eds.): IPAW 2008, LNCS 5272, pp. 323‚Äì326, 2008. Springer. Data models and serialisation formats for delivering provenance information typically reuse existing metadata models where possible to enable this. Both the OPM VocabularyZhao, J. (2010) \\"Open Provenance Model Vocabulary Specification\\", accessed 2016-04-09. and the PROV OntologyLebo et al. (eds.) \\"PROV-O: The PROV Ontology\\", accessed 2016-04-09. make extensive use of metadata models such as Dublin Core and Semantic Web technologies such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Current practice is to rely on the W3C PROV data model, OPM's successor. There are several maintained and open-source provenance capture implementation at the operating system level such as CamFlow,CamFlow, a Linux security module by the University of Cambridge and Harvard University, Progger for Linux and MS Windows, and SPADE for Linux, MS Windows, and MacOS. Operating system level provenance have gained interest in the security community notably to develop novel intrusion detection techniques. Other implementations exist for specific programming and scripting languages, such as RDataTracker for R, and NoWorkflow for Python.

It does not refer to the circumstances of the collection of the rock. The provenance of sandstone, in particular, can be evaluated by determining the proportion of quartz, feldspar, and lithic fragments (see diagram). =Seed provenance= Seed provenance refers to the specified area in which plants that produced seed are located or were derived. Local provenancing is a position maintained by ecologists that suggests that only seeds of local provenance should be planted in a particular area. However, this view depends on the adaptationist program ‚Äì a view that populations are universally locally adapted.Gould S. J.; Lewontin; R. C. (1979). \\"The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme\\". Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series B: Biological Sciences, 205: 581-598 It is maintained that local seed is best adapted to local conditions, and that outbreeding depression will be avoided. Evolutionary biologists suggest that strict adherence to provenance collecting is not a wise decision because: # Local adaptation is not as common as assumed.Gould & Lewontin 1979 # Background population maladaptation can be driven by natural processes. # Human actions of habitat fragmentation drive maladaptation up and adaptive potential down.Willi Y, Van Buskirk J, Hoffmann AA (2006) Limits to the adaptive potential of small populations. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 433-458. # Natural selection is changing rapidly due to climate change.Parmesan C (2006) Ecological and evolutionary responses to recent climate change. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 37: 637-669. and habitat fragmentation # Population fragments are unlikely to divergence by natural selection since fragmentation (< 500 years). This leads to a low risk of outbreeding depression.Frankham R, Ballou J, Eldridge M, Lacy R, Ralls K, et al. (2011) Predicting the probability of outbreeding depression. Conservation Biology. Provenance trials, where material of different provenances are planted in a single place or at different locations spanning a range of environmental conditions, is a way to reveal genetic variation among provenances. It also contributes to an understanding of how different provenances respond to various climatic and environmental conditions and can as such contribute with knowledge on how to strategically select provenances for climate change adaptation. Computers and law The term provenance is used when ascertaining the source of goods such as computer hardware to assess if they are genuine or counterfeit. Chain of custody is an equivalent term used in law, especially for evidence in criminal or commercial cases. Software provenance encompasses the origin of software and its licensing terms. For example, when incorporating a free, open source or proprietary software component in an application, one may wish to understand its provenance to ensure that licensing requirements are fulfilled and that other software characteristics can be understood. Data provenance covers the provenance of computerized data. There are two main aspects of data provenance: ownership of the data and data usage. Ownership will tell the user who is responsible for the source of the data, ideally including information on the originator of the data. Data usage gives details regarding how the data has been used and modified and often includes information on how to cite the data source or sources. Data provenance is of particular concern with electronic data, as data sets are often modified and copied without proper citation or acknowledgement of the originating data set. Databases make it easy to select specific information from data sets and merge this data with other data sources without any documentation of how the data was obtained or how it was modified from the original data set or sets. The automated analysis of data provenance graphs has been described as a mean to verify compliance with regulations regarding data usage such as introduced by the EU GDPR. Secure Provenance refers to providing integrity and confidentiality guarantees to provenance information. In other words, secure provenance means to ensure that history cannot be rewritten, and users can specify who else can look into their actions on the object.The Case of the Fake Picasso: Preventing History Forgery with Secure Provenance, Hasan et al., USENIX FAST 2009. A simple method of ensuring data provenance in computing is to mark a file as read only. This allows the user to view the contents of the file, but not edit or otherwise modify it. Read only can also in some cases prevent the user from accidentally or intentionally deleting the file.

Henry Bolingbroke‚Äînow King Henry IV‚Äîis having an unquiet reign. His personal disquiet at the usurpation of his predecessor Richard II would be solved by a crusade to the Holy Land, but trouble on his borders with Scotland and Wales make leaving unwise. Moreover, he is increasingly at odds with the Percy family, who helped him to his throne, and Edmund Mortimer, the Earl of March, Richard II's chosen heir. A Lithograph depicting Act III Scene II Adding to King Henry's troubles is the behaviour of his son and heir, the Prince of Wales. Hal (the future Henry V) has forsaken the Royal Court to waste his time in taverns with low companions. This makes him an object of scorn to the nobles and calls into question his royal worthiness. Hal's chief friend and foil in living the low life is Sir John Falstaff. Fat, old, drunk, and corrupt as he is, he has a charisma and a zest for life that captivates the Prince. The play features three groups of characters that interact slightly at first, and then come together in the Battle of Shrewsbury, where the success of the rebellion will be decided. First there is King Henry himself and his immediate council. He is the engine of the play, but usually in the background. Next there is the group of rebels, energetically embodied in Henry Percy (\\"Hotspur\\") and including his father, the Earl of Northumberland and led by his uncle Thomas Percy, Earl of Worcester. The Scottish Earl of Douglas, Edmund Mortimer and the Welshman Owen Glendower also join. Finally, at the centre of the play are the young Prince Hal and his companions Falstaff, Poins, Bardolph, and Peto. Streetwise and pound-foolish, these rogues manage to paint over this grim history in the colours of comedy. As the play opens, the king is angry with Hotspur for refusing him most of the prisoners taken in a recent action against the Scots at Holmedon. Hotspur, for his part, would have the king ransom Edmund Mortimer (his wife's brother) from Owen Glendower, the Welshman who holds him. Henry refuses, berates Mortimer's loyalty, and treats the Percys with threats and rudeness. Stung and alarmed by Henry's dangerous and peremptory way with them, they proceed to make common cause with the Welsh and Scots, intending to depose \\"this ingrate and cankered Bolingbroke.\\"Henry IV, Part 1, 1.3.137, in Bevington (1997). By Act II, rebellion is brewing. Robert Smirke Meanwhile, Henry's son Hal is joking, drinking, and thieving with Falstaff and his associates. He likes Falstaff but makes no pretense at being like him. He enjoys insulting his dissolute friend and makes sport of him by joining in Poins' plot to disguise themselves and rob and terrify Falstaff and three friends of loot they have stolen in a highway robbery, purely for the fun of hearing Falstaff lie about it later, after which Hal returns the stolen money. Rather early in the play, in fact, Hal informs us that his riotous time will soon come to a close, and he will re-assume his rightful high place in affairs by showing himself worthy to his father and others through some (unspecified) noble exploits. Hal believes that this sudden change of manner will amount to a greater reward and acknowledgment of prince-ship, and in turn earn him respect from the members of the court. The revolt of Mortimer and the Percys very quickly gives him his chance to do just that. The high and the low come together when the Prince makes up with his father and is given a high command. He vows to fight and kill the rebel Hotspur, and orders Falstaff (who is, after all, a knight) to take charge of a group of foot soldiers and proceed to the battle site at Shrewsbury. An 1829 watercolor by Johann Heinrich Ramberg of Act II, Scene iv: Falstaff enacts the part of the king. The battle is crucial because if the rebels even achieve a standoff their cause gains greatly, as they have other powers awaiting under Northumberland, Glendower, Mortimer, and the Archbishop of York. Henry needs a decisive victory here. He outnumbers the rebels,Henry IV, Part 1, 4.3.30, 4.4.19, in Bevington (1997). but Hotspur, with the wild hope of despair, leads his troops into battle. The day wears on, the issue still in doubt, the king harried by the wild Scot Douglas, when Prince Hal and Hotspur, the two Harrys that cannot share one land, meet. Finally they will fight ‚Äì for glory, for their lives, and for the kingdom. No longer a tavern brawler but a warrior, the future king prevails, ultimately killing Hotspur in single combat. On the way to this climax, we are treated to Falstaff, who has \\"misused the King's press damnably\\",Henry IV, Part 1, 4.2.12, in Bevington (1997) not only by taking money from able-bodied men who wished to evade service but by keeping the wages of the poor souls he brought instead who were killed in battle (\\"food for powder, food for powder\\").Henry IV, Part 1, 4.2.64, in Bevington (1997). Left on his own during Hal's battle with Hotspur, Falstaff dishonourably counterfeits death to avoid attack by Douglas. After Hal leaves Hotspur's body on the field, Falstaff revives in a mock miracle. Seeing he is alone, he stabs Hotspur's corpse in the thigh and claims credit for the kill.Henry IV, Part 1, 5.4.110ff., in Norton (2008). Though Hal knows better, he allows Falstaff his disreputable tricks. Soon after being given grace by Hal, Falstaff states that he wants to amend his life and begin \\"to live cleanly as a nobleman should do\\".Henry IV, Part 1, 5.4.138ff., in Norton (2008). The second edition of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles of England, Scotlande, and Irelande, printed in 1587. The play ends at Shrewsbury, after the battle. The death of Hotspur has taken the heart out of the rebels,Henry IV, Part 1, 55.19, in Bevington (1997). and the king's forces prevail. Henry is pleased with the outcome, not least because it gives him a chance to execute Thomas Percy, the Earl of Worcester, one of his chief enemies (though previously one of his greatest friends). Meanwhile, Hal shows off his kingly mercy in praise of valour; having taken the valiant Douglas prisoner, Hal orders his enemy released without ransom.Henry IV, Part 1, 5.5.28ff., in Norton (2008). But the war goes on; now the king's forces must deal with the Archbishop of York, who has joined with Northumberland, and with the forces of Mortimer and Glendower. This unsettled ending sets the stage for Henry IV, Part 2. Sources Shakespeare's primary source for Henry IV, Part 1, as for most of his chronicle histories, was the second edition (1587) of Raphael Holinshed's Chronicles, which in turn drew on Edward Hall's The Union of the Two Illustrious Families of Lancaster and York. Scholars have also assumed that Shakespeare was familiar with Samuel Daniel's poem on the civil wars. Another source for this (and the following Henry plays) is the anonymous The Famous Victories of Henry V. Date and text 1 Henry IV was almost certainly in performance by 1597, given the wealth of allusions and references to the Falstaff character.Weil and Weil, p. 4. The earliest recorded performance occurred on the afternoon of 6 March 1600, when the play was acted at court before the Flemish Ambassador. Other court performances followed in 1612 and 1625. The play was entered into the Register of the Stationers Company on 25 Feb. 1598 and first printed in quarto later that year by stationer Andrew Wise. The play was Shakespeare's most popular printed text: new editions appeared in 1599, 1604, 1608, 1613, 1622, 1632, 1639, and 1692. =The Dering Manuscript= The Dering Manuscript The Dering Manuscript, the earliest extant manuscript text of any Shakespearean play,Leaving aside MS Harley 7368 of the British Library containing the text of the play Sir Thomas More if this play does indeed contain a contribution by Shakespeare. Folios 8-9a of that manuscript, which contain the part supposed to be by Shakespeare, have even been suggested to be a Shakespeare autograph. For further information see the wikipedia article dedicated to the play. provides a single-play version of both Part 1 and Part 2 of Henry IV. The consensus of Shakespeare scholars is that the Dering MS. represents a redaction prepared around 1623, perhaps for family or amateur theatrics, by Edward Dering (1598‚Äì1644), of Surrenden Manor, Pluckley, Kent, where the manuscript was discovered. A few dissenters have argued that the Dering MS. may indicate that Shakespeare's Henry IV was originally a single play, which the poet later expanded into two parts to capitalise on the popularity of the Sir John Falstaff character. The Dering MS. is part of the collection of the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C.Halliday, Shakespeare Companion, p. 135. Criticism and analysis \\"Rise from the ground like feathered Mercury/ And vaulted with such ease into his seat/ As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds/ To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus/ And witch the world with noble horsemanship.\\" Act IV, Scene i, Hal's transformation, William Blake 1809 =Themes and interpretations= At its first publication in 1597 or 1598 the play was titled The History of Henrie the Fourth and its title page advertised only the presence of Henry Percy and the comic Sir John Falstaff; Prince Hal was not mentioned. Indeed, throughout most of the play's performance history, Hal was staged as a secondary figure, and the stars of the stage, beginning with James Quin and David Garrick often preferred to play Hotspur. It was only in the twentieth century that readers and performers began to see the central interest as the coming-of-age story of Hal, who is now seen as the starring role. In the \\"coming-of-age\\" interpretation, Hal's acquaintance with Falstaff and the tavern lowlife humanises him and provides him with a more complete view of life. At the outset, Prince Hal seems to pale in comparison with the fiery Henry Percy, the young noble lord of the North (whom Shakespeare portrays considerably younger than he was in history in order to provide a foil for Hal). Many readers interpret the history as a tale of Prince Hal growing up, evolving into King Henry V,Sanders 31. perhaps the most heroic of all of Shakespeare's characters, in what is a tale of the prodigal son adapted to the politics of medieval England.Duthie 141. The low proportion of scenes featuring the title character, the king, has also been noted, with some authors suggesting that the play contrasts the authority of Henry IV, and his struggle to stay in control of the situation, with the chaotic forces of the rebels and Falstaff. =Oldcastle controversy= The title page from the first quarto edition of the play, printed in 1599. Henry IV, Part 1 caused controversy on its first performances in 1597, because the comic character now known as \\"Falstaff\\" was originally named \\"Oldcastle\\" and was based on John Oldcastle, a famous proto- Protestant martyr with powerful living descendants in England. Although the character is called Falstaff in all surviving texts of the play, there is abundant external and internal evidence that he was originally called Oldcastle. The change of names is mentioned in seventeenth-century works by Richard James (\\"Epistle to Sir Harry Bourchier\\", c. 1625) and Thomas Fuller (Worthies of England, 1662). It is also indicated in details in the early texts of Shakespeare's plays. In the quarto text of Henry IV, Part 2 (1600), one of Falstaff's speech prefixes in Act I, Scene ii is mistakenly left uncorrected, \\"Old.\\" instead of \\"Falst.\\" In III, ii, 25-6 of the same play, Falstaff is said to have been a \\"page to Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk\\"‚Äîwhich was true of the historical Oldcastle. In Henry IV, Part 1, I, ii, 42, Prince Hal calls Falstaff \\"my old lad of the castle\\". An iambic pentameter verse line in Henry IV, Part 1 is irregular when using the name \\"Falstaff\\", but regular with \\"Oldcastle\\". Finally, there is the blatant disclaimer at the close of Henry IV, Part 2 that discriminates between the two figures: \\"for Oldcastle died [a] martyr, and this is not the man\\" (Epilogue, 29‚Äì32). Trent, proposes diverting the river southwards to give him a still greater share. The plan highlights his destructive and argumentative nature. There is even a hint that Falstaff was originally Oldcastle in The Merry Wives of Windsor too. When the First Folio and quarto texts of that play are compared, it appears that the joke in V,v,85‚Äì90 is that Oldcastle/Falstaff incriminates himself by calling out the first letter of his name, \\"O, O, O!,\\" when his fingertips are singed with candles‚Äîwhich of course works for \\"Oldcastle\\" but not \\"Falstaff.\\" There is also the \\"castle\\" reference in IV,v,6 of the same play.Scoufos, Shakespeare's Typological Satire, p. 191. The name change and the Epilogue disclaimer were required, it is generally thought, because of political pressure: the historical Oldcastle was not only a Protestant martyr, but a nobleman with powerful living descendants in Elizabethan England. These were the Lords Cobham: William Brooke, 10th Baron Cobham (died 6 March 1597), was Warden of the Cinque Ports (1558‚Äì97), Knight of the Order of the Garter (1584), and member of the Privy Council (1586‚Äì97); his son Henry Brooke, 11th Baron Cobham, was granted the paternal post of Warden of the Cinque Ports upon his father's death, and made a Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1599. Even more so, Frances Brooke, the 10th Baron's wife and 11th Baron's mother, was a close personal favourite of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth I. The elder Lord Cobham even had a strong negative impact upon the lives of Shakespeare and his contemporaries in the theatre. The company of actors formed by Shakespeare, Richard Burbage, Will Kempe and the others in 1594 enjoyed the patronage of Henry Carey, first Lord Hunsdon, then serving as Lord Chamberlain; they were, famously, the Lord Chamberlain's Men. When Carey died on 22 July 1596, the post of Lord Chamberlain was given to William Brooke, Lord Cobham, who definitely was not a friend to the players, and who withdrew what official protection they had enjoyed. The players were left to the mercies of the local officials of the City of London, who had long wanted to drive the companies of actors out of the city. Thomas Nashe, in a contemporary letter, complained that the actors were \\"piteously persecuted by the Lord Mayor and the aldermen\\" during this period. This interval did not last; when Cobham died less than a year later, the post of Lord Chamberlain went to Henry Carey's son George, 2nd baron Hunsdon, and the actors regained their previous patronage.Halliday, Shakespeare Companion, p. 107; Scoufos, p. 99. The name was changed to \\"Falstaff\\", based on Sir John Fastolf, an historical person with a reputation for cowardice at the Battle of Patay, and whom Shakespeare had previously represented in Henry VI, Part 1. Fastolf had died without descendants, making him safe for a playwright's use. Shortly afterward, a team of playwrights wrote a two-part play entitled Sir John Oldcastle, which presents a heroic dramatisation of Oldcastle's life and was published in 1600. In 1986, the Oxford Shakespeare edition of Shakespeare's works rendered the character's name as Oldcastle, rather than Falstaff, in Henry IV, Part 1 (although not, confusingly, in Part 2), as a consequence of the editors' aim to present the plays as they would have appeared during their original performances. No other published editions have followed suit. Adaptations A photograph of John Jack as Falstaff in a late 19th-century performance of the play. There have been three BBC television films of Henry IV, Part 1. In the 1960 mini-series An Age of Kings, Tom Fleming starred as Henry IV, with Robert Hardy as Prince Hal, Frank Pettingell as Falstaff and Sean Connery as Hotspur. The 1979 BBC Television Shakespeare version starred Jon Finch as Henry IV, David Gwillim as Prince Hal, Anthony Quayle as Falstaff and Tim Pigott-Smith as Hotspur. In the 2012 series The Hollow Crown, Henry IV, Part 1 was directed by Richard Eyre and starred Jeremy Irons as Henry IV, Tom Hiddleston as Prince Hal, Simon Russell Beale as Falstaff and Joe Armstrong as Hotspur.\\"Cultural Olympiad 2012: Shakespeare's History Plays\\", BBC Media Centre, 24 November 2011. Retrieved 2012-07-04. Orson Welles' Chimes at Midnight (1965) compiles the two Henry IV plays into a single, condensed storyline, while adding a handful of scenes from Henry V and dialogue from Richard II and The Merry Wives of Windsor. The film stars Welles himself as Falstaff, John Gielgud as King Henry, Keith Baxter as Hal, Margaret Rutherford as Mistress Quickly and Norman Rodway as Hotspur. BBC Television's 1995 Henry IV also combines the two Parts into one adaptation. Ronald Pickup played the King, David Calder Falstaff, Jonathan Firth Hal and Rufus Sewell Hotspur. Adapted scenes in flashback from Henry IV are included in the 1989 film version of Henry V (1989) with Robbie Coltrane portraying Sir John Falstaff and Kenneth Branagh playing the young Prince Hal. Gus Van Sant's 1991 film My Own Private Idaho is loosely based on Part 1 of Henry IV, as well as Henry IV, Part 2 and Henry V. The one-man hip-hop musical Clay is loosely based on Henry IV. In 2015 The Michigan Shakespeare Festival produced an award-winning combined production ‚Äì directed and adapted by Janice L Blixt of the two playshttps://www.michiganshakespearefestival.com/past-productions focusing on the relationship between Henry IV and Prince Hal. In 2016, Graham Abbey combined Richard II and Henry IV, Part 1 into a single play called Breath of Kings: Rebellion. Henry IV, Part II and Henry V together became Breath of Kings: Redemption. Both adaptations were staged at the Stratford Festival in Stratford, Ontario. Abbey, in the productions, played Henry IV (Bolingbroke). The 2016 app Cycle of Kings features the entire play Henry IV, Part 1 in interactive form, as well as a modern English translation. In 2019, Netflix released the film The King, an adaptation of the play directed by David Mich√¥d, and starring Timothe√© Chalamet, Robert Pattinson, and Joel Edgerton. Legacy The famous Sherlock Holmes catchphrase \\"The game is afoot.\\" is taken from Act I, Scene 3, line 615, where the Earl of Northumberland says: \\"Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.\\" The phrase was also later used by Shakespeare in Henry V, Act III, Scene 1, by the title character: :\\"I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips, :Straining upon the start. The game's afoot: :Follow your spirit, and upon this charge :Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!\\" Notes References * Barker, Roberta. \\"Tragical-Comical-Historical Hotspur.\\" Shakespeare Quarterly 54.3 (2003): 288‚Äì307. * Bevington, David, ed.

The term \\"gum arabic\\" does not indicate a particular botanical source. In a few cases, the so-called \\"gum arabic\\" may not even have been collected from acacia species, but may originate from Combretum, Albizia, or some other genus. The gum is harvested commercially from wild trees, mostly in Sudan (80%) and throughout the Sahel, from Senegal to Somalia. The name \\"gum Arabic\\" (al-samgh al-'arabi) was used in the Middle East at least as early as the 9th century. Gum arabic first found its way to Europe via Arabic ports, so retained its name. Gum arabic is a complex mixture of glycoproteins and polysaccharides predominantly consisting of arabinose and galactose. It is soluble in water, edible, and used primarily in the food industry and soft-drink industry as a stabilizer, with E number E414 (I414 in the US). Gum arabic is a key ingredient in traditional lithography and is used in printing, paint production, glue, cosmetics, and various industrial applications, including viscosity control in inks and in textile industries, though less expensive materials compete with it for many of these roles. Definition Gum arabic was defined by the 31st Codex Committee for Food Additives, held at The Hague from 19‚Äì23 March 1999, as the dried exudate from the trunks and branches of Acacia senegal or Vachellia (Acacia) seyal in the family Fabaceae (Leguminosae). A 2017 safety re-evaluation by the Panel on Food Additives and Nutrient Sources of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) said that the term \\"gum arabic\\" does not indicate a particular botanical source; in a few cases, so‚Äêcalled \\"gum arabic\\" may not even have been collected from Acacia species. Usage Gum arabic exuding from Acacia nilotica Gum arabic's mixture of polysaccharides and glycoproteins gives it the properties of a glue and binder that is edible by humans. Other substances have replaced it where toxicity is not an issue, as the proportions of the various chemicals in gum arabic vary widely and make it unpredictable. Still, it remains an important ingredient in soft drink syrup and \\"hard\\" gummy candies such as gumdrops, marshmallows, and M&M;'s chocolate candies. For artists, it is the traditional binder in watercolor paint and in photography for gum printing, and it is used as a binder in pyrotechnic compositions. Pharmaceutical drugs and cosmetics also use the gum as a binder, emulsifying agent, and a suspending or viscosity-increasing agent. Wine makers have used gum arabic as a wine fining agent. It is an important ingredient in shoe polish, and can be used in making homemade incense cones. It is also used as a lickable adhesive, for example on postage stamps, envelopes, and cigarette papers. Lithographic printers employ it to keep the non-image areas of the plate receptive to water. This treatment also helps to stop oxidation of aluminium printing plates in the interval between processing of the plate and its use on a printing press. =Food= Gum arabic is used in the food industry as a stabilizer, emulsifier, and thickening agent in icing, fillings, soft candy, chewing gum, and other confectionery, and to bind the sweeteners and flavorings in soft drinks. A solution of sugar and gum arabic in water, gomme syrup, is sometimes used in cocktails to prevent the sugar from crystallizing and provide a smooth texture. Gum arabic is a complex polysaccharide and soluble dietary fibre that is generally recognized as safe for human consumption. An indication of harmless flatulence occurs in some people taking large doses of 30 g or more per day. It is not degraded in the intestine, but fermented in the colon under the influence of microorganisms; it is a prebiotic (as distinct from a probiotic). No regulatory or scientific consensus has been reached about its caloric value; an upper limit of 2 kcal/g was set for rats, but this is not valid for humans. The US FDA initially set a value of 4 kcal/g for food labelling, but in Europe no value was assigned for soluble dietary fibre. A 1998 review concluded that \\"based on present scientific knowledge, only an arbitrary value can be used for regulatory purposes\\". In 2008, the USFDA sent a letter of no objection in response to an application to reduce the rated caloric value of gum arabic to 1.7 kcal/g. =Painting and art= Powdered gum arabic for artists, one part gum arabic is dissolved in four parts distilled water to make a liquid suitable for adding to pigments. A selection of gouaches, some containing gum arabic Gum arabic is used as a binder for watercolor painting because it dissolves easily in water. Pigment of any color is suspended within the acacia gum in varying amounts, resulting in watercolor paint. Water acts as a vehicle or a diluent to thin the watercolor paint and helps to transfer the paint to a surface such as paper. When all moisture evaporates, the acacia gum typically does not bind the pigment to the paper surface, but is totally absorbed by deeper layers.D. Kraaijpoel & C. Herenius. (2007) Het kunstschilderboek ‚Äî handboek voor materialen en technieken, Cantecleer, p. 183 If little water is used, after evaporation, the acacia gum functions as a true binder in a paint film, increasing luminosity and helping prevent the colors from lightening. Gum arabic allows more subtle control over washes, because it facilitates the dispersion of the pigment particles. In addition, acacia gum slows evaporation of water, giving slightly longer working time. The addition of a little gum arabic to watercolor pigment and water allows for easier lifting of pigment from paper, thus can be a useful tool when lifting out color when painting in watercolor. =Ceramics= Gum arabic has a long history as additives to ceramic glazes. It acts as a binder, helping the glaze adhere to the clay before it is fired, thereby minimising damage by handling during the manufacture of the piece. As a secondary effect, it also acts as a deflocculant, increasing the fluidity of the glaze mixture, but also making it more likely to sediment out into a hard cake if not used for a while. The gum is normally made up into a solution in hot water (typically 10‚Äì25 g/l), and then added to the glaze solution after any ball milling in concentrations from 0.02% to 3.0% of gum arabic to the dry weight of the glaze. On firing, the gum burns out at a low temperature, leaving no residues in the glaze. More recently, particularly in commercial manufacturing, gum arabic is often replaced by more refined and consistent alternatives, such as carboxymethyl cellulose. =Photography= The historical photography process of gum bichromate photography uses gum arabic mixed with ammonium or potassium dichromate and pigment to create a coloured photographic emulsion that becomes relatively insoluble in water upon exposure to ultraviolet light. In the final print, the acacia gum permanently binds the pigments onto the paper. =Printmaking= Gum arabic is also used to protect and etch an image in lithographic processes, both from traditional stones and aluminum plates. In lithography, gum by itself may be used to etch very light tones, such as those made with a number-five crayon. Phosphoric, nitric, or tannic acid is added in varying concentrations to the acacia gum to etch the darker tones up to dark blacks. The etching process creates a gum adsorb layer within the matrix that attracts water, ensuring that the oil-based ink does not stick to those areas. Gum is also essential to what is sometimes called paper lithography, printing from an image created by a laser printer or photocopier. =Pyrotechnics= Gum arabic is also used as a water-soluble binder in fireworks composition. =Fuel charcoal= Gum arabic is used as a binding agent in the making of fuel charcoal. Charcoal made from the taifa plant is powdery, and so in order to form charcoal cakes, gum arabic is mixed with this powder and allowed to dry. Fuel charcoal made from taifa and gum arabic is used for cooking fires in Senegal and a few other African countries.  Composition  Arabinogalactan is a biopolymer consisting of arabinose and galactose monosaccharides. It is a major component of many plant gums, including gum arabic. 8-5' Noncyclic diferulic acid has been identified as covalently linked to carbohydrate moieties of the arabinogalactan-protein fraction. Production Acacia senegal from Paul Hermann Wilhelm Taubert's Leguminosae, in Engelmann (ed.): Nat√ºrliche Pflanzenfamilien. Vol. III, 3., 1891 Vachellia seyal from Paul Hermann Wilhelm Taubert's Leguminosae, in Engelmann (ed.): Nat√ºrliche Pflanzenfamilien. Vol. III, 3., 1891 While gum arabic has been harvested in Arabia, Sudan, and West Asia since antiquity, sub-Saharan acacia gum has a long history as a prized export. The gum exported came from the band of acacia trees that once covered much of the Sahel region, the southern littoral of the Sahara Desert that runs from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea. Today, the main populations of gum-producing Acacia species are found in Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. Acacia is tapped for gum by stripping bits off the bark, from which gum then exudes. Traditionally harvested by seminomadic desert pastoralists in the course of their transhumance cycle, acacia gum remains a main export of several African nations, including Mauritania, Niger, Chad, and Sudan. Total world gum arabic exports are today (2019) estimated at 160,000 tonnes, having recovered from 1987‚Äì1989 and 2003‚Äì2005 crises caused by the destruction of trees by the desert locust. =Political aspects= West Africa In 1445, Prince Henry the Navigator set up a trading post on Arguin Island (off the coast of modern Mauritania), which acquired acacia gum and slaves for Portugal. With the merger of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns in 1580, the Spaniards became the dominant influence along the coast. In 1638, however, they were replaced by the Dutch, who were the first to begin exploiting the acacia gum trade. Produced by the acacia trees of Trarza and Brakna, this acacia gum was considered superior to that previously obtained in Arabia. By 1678, the French had driven out the Dutch and established a permanent settlement at Saint Louis at the mouth of the Senegal River. Gum Arabic came to play an essential role in textile printing and therefore in pre-industrial economies of France, Great-Britain and other European countries. Throughout the 18th century, their competition over the commodity was so fierce, that some have spoken of gum wars. Bakel on the Senegal River, 1890 (illustration from \\"C√¥te occidentale d'Afrique du Colonel Frey\\", pl. en reg. p. 100) For much of the 18th and 19th centuries, gum arabic was the major export from French and British trading colonies in modern Senegal and Mauritania. West Africa had become the sole supplier of world acacia gum by the 18th century, and its export at the French colony of Saint-Louis doubled in the decade of 1830 alone. Taxes, and a threat to bypass Saint-Louis by sending gum to the British traders at Portendick, eventually brought the Emirate of Trarza into direct conflict with the French. In the 1820s, the French launched the Franco-Trarzan War of 1825. The new emir, Muhammad al Habib, had signed an agreement with the Waalo Kingdom, directly to the south of the river. In return for an end to raids in Waalo territory, the Emir took the heiress of Waalo as a bride. The prospect that Trarza might inherit control of both banks of the Senegal struck at the security of French traders, and the French responded by sending a large expeditionary force that crushed Muhammad's army. The war incited the French to expand to the north of the Senegal River for the first time, heralding French direct involvement in the interior of West Africa. Africa continued to export gum arabic in large quantities‚Äîfrom the Sahel areas of French West Africa (modern Senegal, Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, and Niger) and French Equatorial Africa (modern Chad) until these nations gained their independence in 1959‚Äì61. Sudan Hundreds of thousands of Sudanese are dependent on gum arabic for their livelihoods. After market reforms, Sudan's exports of gum arabic are now (2019) at about 160.000 tonnes. The production of gum arabic is heavily controlled by the Sudanese government. Pharmacology Gum arabic slows the rate of absorption of some drugs, including amoxycillin, from the gut. Nomadic populations of the Sahel and Arabia have known the beneficial effects of gum arabic for ages. In Europe, pharmaceutical applications were also among the first uses. Symbolic value In the work of Shakespeare, Jacob Cats and many other European poets of the 13th to 17th centuries, gum arabic represented the \\"noble Orient\\". In the Sahel, it is a symbol of the purity of youth.

As The Christian polytechnic university, it offers degree programs in engineering, aeronautical science, business, education, nursing, psychology, theology and the arts and sciences. The university also provides graduate and undergraduate degree programs online and at the university's main campus in Longview. Founded as LeTourneau Technical Institute in February 1946 by R. G. LeTourneau with his wife, Evelyn, the school initially educated veterans returning from World War II. Total annual enrollment is nearly 3,000.  History  R. G. LeTourneau Memorial Center R. G. LeTourneau founded LeTourneau Technical Institute in February 1946 on the site of the recently abandoned Harmon General Hospital, a World War II hospital specialized in treating servicemen with neurological and dermatological issues. Randall Herbert Balmer, Encyclopedia of Evangelicalism: Revised and expanded edition, Baylor University Press, USA, 2004, p. 403LeTourneau bought the site from the United States government with the help of Longview News-Journal publisher Carl Estes and other Longview community leaders for one dollar with the conditions that for the next decade, the U.S. government could reclaim the 156 acres (631,000 m¬≤) and 220 buildings in the event of an emergency and no new construction or demolition could occur. The State of Texas chartered the school on February 20, 1946, and classes were first held on April 1. At that point, enrollment at LeTourneau was exclusively male and predominantly veterans. For the first two years, LeTourneau provided an academy section to allow the completion of the junior and senior years of high school as well as a college section that offered two-year trade skill programs and a four-year technology program. Students attended classes on alternating days; while one half of the students were in class, the other half worked at R. G. LeTourneau's nearby LeTourneau Incorporated manufacturing plant (now part of Cameron International), thus satisfying the laboratory requirements of all of the industrial courses. From 1946 to 1961, LeTourneau Technical Institute and LeTourneau, Inc. were one unified company under R. G. LeTourneau. In 1961, LeTourneau Technical Institute underwent a transformation into the co-educational LeTourneau College and began to offer bachelor's degrees in engineering, technology, and a limited number of arts and sciences. At this point, the college began to transition from the traditional wooden barracks buildings. The Tyler Hall Dormitory for men was erected in 1962, the Margaret Estes Library in 1963 and the Hollingsworth Science Hall in 1965. The bell tower and mall at the center of campus The college continued to grow under the leadership of Allen C. Tyler in 1961 and 1962 and Richard H. LeTourneau (eldest son of R. G. and Evelyn) from 1962 to 1968. Harry T. Hardwick's presidency from 1968 to 1975 saw to the construction of the R. G. LeTourneau Memorial Student Center and the Longview Citizens Resource Center along with spearheading LeTourneau's accreditation by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. Richard LeTourneau again assumed the presidency from 1975 to 1985, during which time he oversaw the accreditation of the school's mechanical and electrical engineering programs by the Engineer's Council for Professional Development (now the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) and supervised nine major construction projects. Glaske Center for Engineering, Science, and Technology \\"The Spirit of Ingenuity\\" outside the Glaske Center symbolizes the academic mission of LeTourneau University. Margaret Estes Library Longview Hall is the center of business, psychology, and continuing education. Heath-Hardwick Hall for the Liberal Arts LeTourneau College became LeTourneau University in 1989 under the leadership of President Alvin O. Austin, who served until 2007. Austin oversaw the development of an MBA program and the expansion of programs in business and education into educational centers in Houston, Dallas, Tyler, Austin and Bedford. Austin also oversaw the removal of all wooden barracks from the Longview campus except the historic landmark known as Speer Chapel, which is the only remaining WWII-era structure and is a popular place for weddings and ceremonies. Under Austin's leadership, the university's main campus underwent considerable improvements including the construction of the university mall and Belcher Bell Tower, the Solheim Recreation and Activity Center, the Glaske Engineering Center, seven new residence halls, and the S.E. Belcher Jr. Chapel and Performance Center, a 2,011-seat auditorium that opened in spring 2007. In the spring of 2006, Austin announced that he would retire from his position as university president in June 2007 and assume the newly created role of university chancellor. On March 8, 2007, Dale A. Lunsford was announced as the new president of LeTourneau University. He assumed the office on July 1, 2007. Prior to accepting the job as university president, Lunsford served as the vice president of student affairs and external relations at the University of Texas at Tyler.LeTourneau University Names New President The school was in the spotlight in May 2015 when Outsports reported it \\"updated its student- athlete handbook to ban gay athletes from dating\\" and \\"athletes from showing support for gay marriage\\". Academics At the core of LeTourneau University is an undergraduate program of 1,396 traditional students at its main campus in Longview. LeTourneau has a diverse pool of undergraduates, representing 50 states, 20 countries, and over 45 denominations. The average undergraduate SAT score is 1170 and LeTourneau undergraduates have an average of 3.5 high school GPA. Most of the university's undergraduate degrees are focused on engineering, aeronautics, computer science, business, education. A smaller liberal arts program provides educational balance to the largely technical concentrations. The school also offers extensive business and management graduate classes in Houston, Dallas, and Longview.LeTourneau University - What Sets Us Apart In March 2016, LeTourneau received attention for its Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems degree program. Athletics The LeTourneau YellowJackets compete in nine women's sports and eight men's sports in NCAA Division III athletics in the American Southwest Conference. These sports include men's and women's soccer, basketball, golf, tennis, cross country, indoor and outdoor track and field, men's baseball, women's softball, and women's volleyball.The school's mascot is \\"Buzz\\" the yellow jacket and the colors are royal blue and gold. LeTourneau Athletic Director Terri Deike has overseen an improvement in LeTourneau Athletics in recent years, with multiple teams achieving playoff berths, many for the first time in over a decade. The Baseball team were the 2014 American Southwest Conference Champions. The Men's Basketball Team won more games than any ASC School from 2016-2020 averaging 22 wins a season, two ASC East Championships and the school's only NCAA Team Tournament win. The Men's Basketball team won the 2020 American Southwest Conference Tournament. LeTourneau also has a club Men's Rugby team which competes in the Lone Star conference of the Texas Rugby Union, a division of USA Rugby, alongside schools such as The University of Texas at San Antonio and Southern Methodist University. In May 2015, Outsports reported LETU had \\"updated its student-athlete handbook to ban gay athletes from dating\\" and \\"from showing support for gay marriage.\\" Demographics Traditional undergraduate enrollment and working adult enrollment look very different at LETU. Of traditional undergraduates enrolled at the Longview campus in the Fall of 2008, 72 percent are male and 28 percent are female, with an average age of 21. Three percent are international students; 52 percent come from other states. Homeschoolers account for nearly one in six students on LeTourneau's Longview campus.LeTourneau University - Quick Facts At LeTourneau's satellite campuses, which are exclusively used for nontraditional students, women outnumber men with 70 percent of the total enrollment. Caucasians make up 65.4 percent of the student body. African-Americans are the largest minority group, with 21.6 percent. Eight percent are Hispanic, 13 percent are Asian, and less than half a percent are Native American.Christian College Mentor - LeTourneau University Location The LeTourneau University campus in 2003 as taken from the passenger seat of one of LeTourneau's Cessna training planes Longview, the seat of Gregg County, is located about a two- hour drive east of Dallas and about a one-hour drive west from Shreveport, Louisiana. The main campus itself is located on the south side of Longview, two miles north of Interstate 20 (exit 595B). Most of LeTourneau University's 1,400 traditional students live on campus; the school requires all unmarried students under the age of 22 (who are not living with parents or relatives during the school year) to live in residence halls and on-campus apartments or to apply for a special waiver to live off-campus. While Longview is home to a variety of neighborhoods, both in age and economic circumstance,CityTownInfo.com - Longview, Texas LeTourneau is located in the middle of the highest poverty (26.1% below poverty line based on 2000 census) and lowest income (median of $26,308 as of 2000 census) compared to 10 surrounding ZIP codes.ZipSkinny.com - 75602: Longview, Texas =Campus life= Dorothy Speer Chapel (reopened 1983) was the former Harmon Hospital chapel in the 1940s. Solheim Recreational & Activity Center John and Florence Thomas Hall residential building Quads 3 and 4, residence halls at LeTourneau In addition to official university sports, intramural competitions in soccer, football, volleyball, ultimate and basketball are also highly valued and widely popular. Somewhat unusual to LeTourneau is the extensive amount of student pride and residence hall unity known as \\"floor pride\\". Many floors in the residence halls have their own student-created name, logo, mascot, colors, T-shirt, etc.; these floors form teams that compete in intramural events. =Floor system= LeTourneau has a housing system similar to the House System with the use of numerous (roughly 30) individual floor assignments as opposed to four houses (which is closer to the House System at Caltech). Housing is generally gender-segregated by building. In years where housing space is limited, one or two residence halls will have housing that is gender- segregated by floor. However, access is limited to each of these floors via Prox cards, which allow only residents into their respective floor areas. Freshmen are placed into floors based upon both building preference and the order in which applications and deposits are received. New students can request a particular floor through their application process, though some are placed at the discretion of Residence Life. Many students remain on the same floor until they graduate from the university, only leaving to move off campus or to on-campus apartments rather than to join another floor. =Greek life= LeTourneau has no traditional Greek system. There are three independent Greek Men's \\"Societies\\" and one independent Greek Women's \\"Society\\". Of those, the Societies Alpha Omega (ŒëŒ©), Kappa Zeta Chi (ŒöŒñŒß), and Lambda Alpha Sigma (ŒõŒëŒ£) have charters from the University and have residence facilities on campus. The Greek Society Residences of ŒëŒ©, ŒöŒñŒß, and LAS are unique in that they are owned by the university but were built with donations from alumni and friends. The Greek Women's \\"Society\\" is Lambda Omega Chi (ŒõŒ©Œß) and has a charter with the University but does not currently have a residential facility on campus. None of LeTourneau's Societies are part of national Greek organizations. Two previous societies, Tau Kappa Delta (Œ§ŒöŒî) and Delta Sigma Psi (ŒîŒ£Œ®) lost their charters from the University in the 1990s. =Other student activities= LeTourneau has a variety of student-led foundations and a representative body of elected students known as the Student Senate (senate seats are allocated by residence hall or living area). A portion of each student's tuition and fees is allocated to Student Senate each year to distribute to spring break mission trips, campus activities, on-campus clubs, and other projects. The Yellowjacket Activities Council (YAC), a university-sanctioned and funded student events committee, is responsible for planning and supervising several recreational \\"student life\\" activities each semester. Several student YAC Coordinators are responsible for different sections of planning and implementation of concerts, coffeehouse parties, midnight festivals, athletic competitions, off-campus events, movie nights, paintball, and Valentine parties. These are a few among the many activities organized by YAC. Homecoming at LeTourneau, while once being hosted in the fall with a talent and variety show along with other activities for returning alumni, is now hosted in the spring. A Starlight Soiree is held, as well as athletic events, including the annual intersociety rope pull competition, and Hootenanny. The traditional Hootenanny variety show brings together the majority of the student body, faculty, staff, alumni, and members of the community for a dose of original comedy, music, and talent. Most students at LETU attend the event. The event is put on by individuals or groups of students who have auditioned in the weeks leading up to the show. 2005 marked the 40th anniversary of the Hootenanny production. Traditionally, members of the school faculty and administration have also participated at the students' request, often in satirical roles. \\"Hootenuity 2007\\" marked the end of using the Belcher Gym as the performance venue, with the new S. E. Belcher Chapel and Performance center slated as the new home for \\"O Hootenanny, Where Art Thou?\\" in the 2007‚Äì2008 school year. Because of this transition, the well-used rotating stage was destroyed and a two-story stage built to make use of the new facility. The rotating stage was a product of a senior design project in the 1970s.

United States =United States Army= insignia insignia (1920‚Äì1968) In the United States Army, recruits usually enter service as a private in pay grade E-1. Private (E-2), designated by a single chevron, is typically an automatic promotion after six months of service. Private first class (E-3), equivalent to NATO grade OR-3, is designated by a single chevron and a rocker stripe and is more common among soldiers who have served in the U.S. Army for one year or more. Soldiers who have achieved an associate degree or its equivalent are entitled to enter the Army at this pay grade. Advancement from private first class is typically to specialist, although occasionally it may be to corporal. The rank of private first class has existed since 1846 and, prior to 1919, its insignia consisted of the branch of service insignia without any arcs or chevrons. The Secretary of War approved \\"an arc of one bar\\" (i.e., a \\"rocker\\") under the branch of service or trade insignia for privates first class on 22 July 1919. From August 5, 1920 to May 28, 1968, the rank insignia for private first class was a single chevron, per War Department Circular No. 303.

The novel was written by Jos√© Rizal, one of the leaders of the Propaganda Movement in the Philippines. Noli Me T√°ngere (Touch Me Not or \\"Social Cancer\\") is a controversial and anticlerical novel that exposed the abuses committed by the Spanish friars (belonging to the Roman Catholic Church) and the Spanish elite in colonial Philippines during the 19th century. The novel, according to the author, represented the state of Philippine society under Spanish colonial rule. It was intended as a liberal-nationalist wake-up call for the people of the Philippines. While the natives (indios) were trained to become secular clergy, Spanish priests in the powerful religious orders were given preferential treatment in the assignment to parishes. Character summary D√°maso Verdolagas, a Franciscan Spanish priest, was the former curate of the town of San Diego. He was an enemy of Don Rafael Ibarra, Cris√≥stomo Ibarra's father; Don Rafael refuses to conform to the friars' power. After Rafael's death in jail, Padre D√°maso ordered his corpse exhumed and transferred to the Chinese cemetery, which was reserved for \\"heathens\\". He was later revealed to be the biological father of Mar√≠a Clara. Mar√≠a Clara's mother, Do√±a P√≠a Alba, and Don Santiago de los Santos, had been trying to conceive a child when Padre D√°maso raped Do√±a Pia. Near the end of the novel, he and Mar√≠a Clara had a dispute about her not marrying Alfonso Linares, and her going to the convent, or dying. This broke Padre D√°maso's heart. By the end of the novel, he was transferred to another town to be its curate.

It is also a police rank in some police services. History of title In origin, certain senior sergeants were assigned to administrative, supervisory, or other specialist duties as part of the staff of a British army regiment. As such they held seniority over sergeants who were members of a battalion or company, and were paid correspondingly increased wages. Their seniority was indicated by a crown worn above the three sergeant's stripes on their uniform rank markings. National variations =Australia= In the Australian Army and Cadets, the rank of staff sergeant is being phased out. It was usually held by the company quartermaster sergeant or the holders of other administrative roles. Staff sergeants are always addressed as \\"Staff Sergeant\\" or \\"Staff\\", never as \\"Sergeant\\" as it degrades their rank. \\"Chief\\" is another nickname though this is only used for the company chief clerk (in some instances the chief clerk role can be filled by another non-commissioned rank (but not warrant officer) and still be referred to as \\"Chief\\"). A staff sergeant ranks above sergeant and below warrant officer class 2. =Israel= IDF Rank: ◊°◊û\\"◊® samar (staff sergeant) In the Israel Defense Forces, soldiers are promoted from sergeant to staff sergeant (sam√°l rish√≥n) after 28 months of service for combat soldiers, and 32 months of service for non-combat soldiers, if they performed their duties appropriately during this time. Soldiers who take a commander's course may become staff sergeants earlier (usually after 24 months of service, or one year from becoming a commander). The rank insignia is composed of three clear- blue stripes (as is the rank of sergeant) with an embroidered fig leaf, a biblical motif, in the center of the rank insignia. Staff sergeants get a symbolic pay raise. = Norway = the Army of Norway. :For further information, see Military ranks and insignia of Norway. In the Norwegian Defence Forces, the tasks and responsibilities of the staff sergeant (oversersjant) are not clear; quite recently, in January 2016, Norway replaced their old rank system, and implemented a new, which is more adapted to other NATO members. In 1975, all of the Norwegian military branches abolished the system of using non-commissioned officers. Now, however, Norway is reintroducing the Non-Commissioned Officer Corps, allowing people to become officers without graduating from a military academy or having a university degree. =Singapore=  Singapore Armed Forces  A staff sergeant (SSG) in the Singapore Armed Forces ranks above first sergeant and below master sergeant. It is the second most senior specialist rank. Staff sergeants are addressed as \\"Staff Sergeant\\" or \\"Staff\\", but never \\"Sergeant\\". Staff sergeants may be appointed as company sergeant major if they are due for promotion to master sergeant. They are usually addressed as \\"CSM\\" in camp, although in the past they were referred to as \\"Encik\\", which is now used to address only warrant officers. The rank insignia consists of two chevrons pointing up and three chevrons pointing down, with the Singapore coat of arms in the middle.Singapore Armed Forces ranks  Home Team  In the Singapore Prison Service, the rank of Staff Sergeant (SSGT) is above the rank of Sergeant, and is below the rank of Chief Warder (1). The rank insignia of SSGT is one Singapore coat of arms and three pointed-down chevrons below it. In the Singapore Police Force, the rank of Staff Sergeant is currently being phased out with the newly overhauled \\"unified police rank structure\\" which allows a direct-entry Sergeant to be eligible for emplacement to the rank of Inspector without a degree. In the past, the rank of Staff Sergeant is above the rank of Sergeant, and below the rank of Senior Staff Sergeant; with the new rank structure being introduced, the rank and insigna of Staff Sergeant is being phased out, and being replaced with three grades of Sergeant, namely, Sergeant (1), Sergeant (2), and Sergeant (3), before being promoted directly to Senior Staff Sergeant. However, all three grades of Sergeants all don the same three chevrons insignia.  Uniformed Youth Organisations  In the National Cadet Corps, Staff Sergeants are cadets who have passed the 3-days 2-nights Senior Specialists Leaders Course successfully. The rank of Staff Sergeant is above First Sergeant and below Master Sergeant. Staff sergeants wear a rank insignia of two pointed-up chevrons, one Singapore coat of arms and three pointed-down chevrons, with the letters 'NCC' located below the insignia to differentiate NCC cadets from SAF personnel. In the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) and the National Civil Defence Cadet Corps (NCDCC), the rank of Staff Sergeant is above Sergeant, and below Station Inspector and Warrant Officer respectively. The rank of Staff Sergeant generally is awarded to cadets when they are in Secondary Four, before they pass out. NPCC and NCDCC Staff Sergeants wear a rank insignia of one Singapore coat of arms and three pointed-down chevrons. The letters 'NPCC' and 'NCDCC' are located below the insignia so as to differentiate NPCC and NCDCC cadets from Singapore Police Force and Singapore Civil Defence Force personnel respectively. In the St John Brigade (SJB), the rank of Staff Sergeant (SSG) is above Sergeant, and below Senior Staff Sergeant. Staff Sergeants in SJB wear a rank insignia of one St John coat of arms and three pointed-down chevrons. =Sweden= Between 2009-2019 the rank of Sergeant was the Swedish equivalent of a NATO OR-5 rank, denoting a squad leader (8-12 soldiers). Apart from the OR-6 First Sergeant, Sweden had never had different sergeant ranks. The rank Furir is reinstated for squad leaders since october 1 2019, as are Sergeant and First Sergeant (OR-6 - equivalents). The rank of Furir was used for the role between the 16th century and 2009. The title come from the French fourrier (\\"who provide fodder\\"), from feurre, straw. The verb furera from 1600/1700th century means 'responsible for quartering'. The Furir rank was reinstated in the 2019 Swedish defence decision and replaces the rank of Sergeant since then. =Republic of China (Taiwan)= Rank insignia of Staff Sergeant () in Taiwan. Staff Sergeant () of the R.O.C Armed Forces in Taiwan ranks below Sergeant and above Corporal, making it different from the armed forces of other countries where staff sergeant ranks higher than sergeant. The rank of Staff Sergeant exists in the Army, Air Force and the Marine Corps, and is equivalent to the Petty officer 2nd Class in the Navy. =United Kingdom= Rank markings of a Staff Sergeant in the British Army. In the British Army, staff sergeant (SSgt or formerly S/Sgt) ranks above sergeant and below warrant officer class 2. The rank is given a NATO code of OR-7. The insignia is the monarch's crown above three downward pointing chevrons. Staff sergeants can also hold other appointments, such as company quartermaster sergeant, and are usually known by that appointment if held. The equivalent rank in infantry regiments is colour sergeant, and holders are known by that title no matter what their appointment. In the Household Cavalry the equivalent rank is staff corporal. British staff sergeants are never referred to or addressed as \\"Sergeant\\", which would be reducing their rank, but are referred to and addressed as \\"Staff Sergeant\\" or \\"Staff\\" (\\"Staff Jones\\", for instance) or by their appointment or its abbreviation. Quartermaster sergeants are often addressed as \\"Q\\". In most cavalry regiments, staff sergeants are addressed as \\"Sergeant Major\\", which is assumed to derive from the original rank of troop sergeant major, or as \\"Sir\\" by subordinates. Flight sergeant and chief technician are the Royal Air Force equivalents. Chief petty officer is the equivalent in the Royal Navy and colour sergeant in the Royal Marines. =United States= U.S. Army staff sergeant's arm badge Staff sergeant insignia U.S. Army U.S. Marine Corps staff sergeant's arm badge Staff sergeant insignia U.S. Marine Corps U.S. Air Force staff sergeant's arm badge Staff sergeant insignia U.S. Air Force U.S. Army Staff sergeant (SSG) is E-6 rank in the U.S. Army, just above sergeant and below sergeant first class, and is a non-commissioned officer. Staff sergeants are generally placed in charge of squads, but can also act as platoon sergeants in the absence of a sergeant first class. In support units, staff sergeants ordinarily hold headquarters positions because of the number of slots available for them in these units. Staff sergeants are typically assigned as a squad leader or company operations non-commissioned officer in charge at the company level, but may also hold other positions depending on the type of unit. Staff sergeants are referred to as \\"Sergeant\\" except in certain training environments and schools. The NATO code is OR-6. The rank of staff sergeant in the U.S. Army, along with technical sergeant (renamed sergeant first class in 1948) and master sergeant, was created by Congress after the First World War. In 1920 the Army combined several company/battery/troop level \\"staff\\" NCO ranks, including color sergeant, supply sergeant, radio sergeant, eleven grades of sergeant first class, three grades of sergeant, two grades of master gunner, and assistant band leader into the new rank of staff sergeant. Staff sergeant, as did the ranks it combined/replaced, then ranked above sergeant but below first sergeant. At that time, sergeants served as section leaders, platoon guides, and assistants to platoon commanders (the position of platoon sergeant, nor a separate rank for the position, did not yet exist), and included several formerly separate ranks such as mess sergeant, company supply sergeant, and stable sergeant, etc. In 1940, staff sergeant became the rank title of rifle platoon sergeants and in 1942 rifle squad leaders became staff sergeants, with platoon sergeants then being promoted to technical sergeants. (Perrenot, 2009)Perrenot, P. United States Army Grade Insignia Since 1776 (2009). U.S. Marine Corps Staff Sergeant (SSgt) is E-6 rank (NATO code OR-6) in the U.S. Marine Corps (USMC), ranking above Sergeant and below Gunnery Sergeant. This grade is normally achieved after 10 years in service. A Marine Staff Sergeant is a staff non-commissioned officer rank (SNCO). These SNCOs are career Marines serving as staff sergeants through Master Gunnery Sergeant/Sergeant Major/Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps in grades E-6 through E-9. Together, they are responsible to the commanding officer for the welfare, morale, discipline, and efficiency of Marines in their charge. Using their experience gained by time in service, including previous deployments, proven military skills and advanced leadership training, SNCOs are responsible for the proficiency, training and administrative issue of their Marines. Staff sergeants in infantry, and light armored reconnaissance units typically serve in the billet of platoon sergeant of a 42-member rifle platoon, an 18-member scout sniper platoon (infantry battalion H&S; company S-2 section) or a 24-member light armored reconnaissance platoon. In reconnaissance battalions, staff sergeants usually serve as squad/team leaders of a 6-member reconnaissance team. When serving as a platoon sergeant, they are the senior tactical advisor to the platoon commander (an officer) and the second-in- command of the platoon. Staff sergeants also serve as a section leaders in weapons platoons (the platoon sergeant being a gunnery sergeant in weapons platoons) leading from 8‚Äì27 Marines in a crew-served weapons section (i.e., machine guns, mortars, assault weapons/rockets, and anti-tank missiles). In artillery batteries staff sergeants serve as either the local security chief/platoon sergeant of a firing battery's 94-member firing platoon or as section chief of a 10-member artillery section (viz., gun crew). In tank and assault amphibian units, they serve as section leaders in charge of 8 Marines manning two tanks or 9 Marines manning three AAVs, respectively, under a gunnery sergeant serving as platoon sergeant. When there is a shortage of gunnery sergeants, they may be assigned to a billet of platoon sergeant or company/battery gunnery sergeant, and in the event of a shortage of officers may be temporarily billeted as a platoon commander. Staff sergeants also serve as staff non-commissioned officers in military staff sections and headquarters and service companies/headquarters batteries at battalion/squadron, regiment/group, division/wing level. Typical staff sergeant billets found in combat support companies and battalion, regiment, and division headquarters are: Personnel Chief, Senior Administration Clerk, Career Planner, Human Affairs NCO, Education/Personal Affairs Assistant, Senior Combat Photographer, Substance Abuse Counselor, Reports NCO, MAGTF Plans Chief, NBC Defense NCO/Training NCO, Intelligence Chief, Senior Intelligence Analyst, Special Security Office Chief, Operations Chief, Operations Assistant, Logistics Chief, Maintenance Management Chief, Ammunition Chief, Senior Ammunition Technician, Local Security Chief, Senior Radio Technician, Wire Chief/Supervisor, Radio Supervisor, Senior Field Radio Operator, Supply Chief, Senior General Warehouseman, Senior Small Arms Repair Technician, Senior Electro-Optical Ordnance Repairman, Motor Vehicle Maintenance Chief, Motor Operations Chief, Assistant Mess Manager, Cook Specialist, and Senior Chief Cook. In Command Element, Combat Logistics Element, and Aviation Combat Element organizations, staff sergeants serve in basically similar positions of responsibility, authority, and accountability as their Ground Combat Element counterparts, with perhaps slightly different titles, such as Branch/Section Chief/NCOIC (Non-Commissioned Officer-In-Charge) in various work centers (e.g. mechanical, avionics, electrical, and ordnance divisions) within the aircraft maintenance department of a Marine aircraft squadron. Non Fleet Marine Force (or other operating forces) assignments may include supervisory or staff positions in recruiting, drill instructor, Marine Security Guard, Naval ROTC instructor or service school instructor, and major/joint/combined headquarters commands. Staff sergeants, as are all Marine Corps SNCOs, addressed and referred to by their complete rank title (i.e. \\"Staff Sergeant Jones\\" or simply \\"Staff Sergeant,\\" with the abbreviation \\"SSgt\\"). The rank of Staff Sergeant in the USMC was created in 1923 to coincide with the U.S. Army's ranks. Until the end of WW2, the insignia of platoon sergeant was three chevrons and a rocker, with Staff Sergeant having a horizontal stripe instead of a rocker below the chevrons. After the separate rank of Platoon Sergeant was eliminated, the Staff Sergeant rank switched over to the rocker insignia and Staff Sergeants held the platoon sergeant's billet. U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force Staff sergeant (SSgt) is E-5 in the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force. It ranks above senior airman and below technical sergeant. It is the Air Force's first non-commissioned officer rank, as well as the first Air Force and Space Force rank to which promotion is attained on a competitive basis. Sergeants, also known in Air Force jargon as \\"buck sergeant\\"', no longer exist, having been eliminated in the 1990s after sharing the same pay grade with that of the rank of senior airman (E-4). Staff sergeants are expected to be technically proficient and function as first-line supervisors within a 'work center'. After being selected for promotion, senior airmen must attend Airman Leadership School, which teaches them basic leadership skills and how to write performance reports to become staff sergeant. The term of address is \\"Staff Sergeant\\" or \\"Sergeant\\". High year of tenure is 20 years as of 2018. Cadet staff sergeant The rank of cadet staff sergeant (CSSG or C/SSgt) is used by many cadet organisations around the world, including the Army Cadet Force and the Army Section of the Combined Cadet Force in the United Kingdom, and the cadet program of Civil Air Patrol in the United States. Police rank The rank of staff sergeant is used in some police forces to indicate a senior supervisor. The rank is used, for example, in most Canadian police services. Other national police services (for example, Cyprus) have a corresponding rank of senior sergeant. In the United Kingdom, a few police forces formerly used the rank of station sergeant, with the same rank insignia as an army staff sergeant. The Hong Kong Police Force still uses this rank. Other uses A number of other organisations, basing their structure on military ranks, have historically used, or still use, the rank of staff sergeant. The rank of staff sergeant was, for example, phased out of the rank structure of St John Ambulance (England and the Islands) in the early 1990s.

United States Army Sergeant First Class insignia Sergeant First Class (SFC) is the seventh enlisted rank (E-7) in the U.S. Army, ranking above staff sergeant (E-6) and below master sergeant and first sergeant (E-8), and is the first non-commissioned officer rank designated as a senior non-commissioned officer (SNCO). A sergeant first class is typically assigned as a platoon sergeant at the company level or battalion operations non-commissioned officer in charge at the battalion level, but may also hold other positions depending on the type of unit. In a combat arms role, a sergeant first class is typically in charge of from 18 soldiers and four tanks in an armor platoon to 40 soldiers in a rifle platoon. A sergeant first class's primary responsibilities are tactical logistics, tactical casualty evacuations, and serving as the senior tactical adviser to the platoon leader. Sergeant first class replaced the rank of technical sergeant in 1948. (However, the U.S. Air Force, which separated from the Army in 1947, retained the rank of technical sergeant and the U.S. Marine Corps had the rank of technical sergeant until 1959.) A sergeant first class is addressed as \\"sergeant\\" except in certain situations, such as field artillery units, in which a sergeant first class serving as platoon sergeant is commonly referred to as \\"Smoke.\\" If a sergeant first class is appointed to fill the role of first sergeant, he or she is addressed as \\"First Sergeant.\\" Typically a sergeant first class assigned on a manning document to fill a first sergeant role while being promotable to master sergeant can be frocked to first sergeant rank and hold the insignia due its position. Sergeant first class is the first enlisted rank in the U.S. Army to be selected by the centralized promotion system. As such, it is considerably more difficult to achieve than the previous ranks. A sergeant first class is the first enlisted rank to be considered a senior non-commissioned officer, and a soldier achieving the rank gains not only prestige, but several benefits due to the position. For example, a sergeant first class cannot be demoted by standard non-judicial punishment. To demote a senior non-commissioned officer requires a court martial, or congressional approval, and normally occurs only for offenses that carry heavy punishments. The rank title of sergeant first class (SFC) existed in the Army from 1890 26-Stat-653 until 1920 when it was eliminated in an army-wide simplification of enlisted ranks which had grown into a system containing 128 different rank insignia. The rank of SFC was used in several technical branches such as the Army Medical Department and in the Ordnance, Signal, and Quartermaster Corps and was equivalent to the field service ranks at the company/battery/troop \\"staff\\" NCO level, such as color sergeant, supply sergeant, or radio sergeant. The Army restored the rank of SFC in 1948 when it replaced technical sergeant.Perrenot,P.

In the Singapore Army, master sergeants are usually instructors, staff specialists, or sergeants major of battalion or company-sized units. = National Cadet Corps = In the National Cadet Corps (NCC), the rank of master sergeant is awarded to outstanding NCC cadets who have contributed greatly to their unit. The insignia of MSG (NCC) is the same as the SAF's, except that the letters 'NCC' are below the insignia, to differentiate SAF and NCC master sergeants.

It is abbreviated as MSG and indicated by three chevrons above three inverted arcs, commonly referred to as \\"rockers\\". A master sergeant may be assigned as a brigade-level section noncommissioned officer in charge and serves as the subject matter expert in his or her field, but may also hold other positions depending on the type of unit. The equivalent-grade first sergeant is the senior noncommissioned officer of a company, battery, or troop. When holding the position of first sergeant, while uncommon, the master sergeant is referred to as \\"first sergeant\\"; however, when not in the position of first sergeant, master sergeants are addressed as \\"sergeant\\". This is the standard address for all pay grades E-5 through E-8. Use of the term \\"top\\" or \\"master sergeant\\" is not a requirement, but is considered courteous and remains to be at the discretion of the one addressing the master sergeant, though \\"top\\" is preferred, due to the long tradition of its use in the US Army, which has, since the Civil War, emphasized the importance of the senior NCO's leading and instructing the newly-minted 2nd-Lieutenants. In 1920 the Army combined several regimental level \\"staff\\" NCO ranks, including four grades of sergeant major, three grades of quartermaster sergeant, regimental supply sergeant, senior ordnance sergeant, senior band sergeant, four grades of senior master sergeant, and seven additional master-level technical and specialist ranks into the new master sergeant rank. Master sergeant then became the senior enlisted rank, ranking above technical sergeant and first sergeant (a positional rank/title for the senior technical sergeant in a company/battery/troop), while \\"sergeant major\\" became a \\"courtesy title\\" for the senior master sergeant in a battalion/squadron or higher headquarters. In 1942, the rank of first sergeant was elevated one grade and was then considered as a junior version of master sergeant, because while first sergeants served as senior NCOs at the company/battery/troop level, master sergeants held positions as the senior NCO in their MOS at battalion/squadron and higher level headquarters. In 1958, both first sergeant and master sergeant were elevated one grade to the new E-8 pay grade, while the rank of sergeant major was restored as the senior enlisted rank at the new pay grade of E-9. =U.S. Marine Corps= The eighth enlisted grade, ranking above gunnery sergeant and below master gunnery sergeant, sergeant major, and Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps. It is equal in grade to first sergeant, and is abbreviated MSgt In the U.S. Marine Corps, master sergeants provide technical leadership as occupational specialists at the E-8 level. Most infantry master sergeants serve as the operations chief of a weapons company, in place of the gunnery sergeant found in the company headquarters of a rifle company. Infantry master sergeants also serve as the assistant operations chief in the S-3 section of the headquarters of an infantry regiment and Marine Expeditionary Unit and in the G-3 section of the headquarters of a Marine Expeditionary Brigade. The Marine division and Marine Expeditionary Force headquarters contains two infantry master sergeants, one as the training SNCO and the other as the readiness chief. Some combat support battalions have master sergeants at the company level (e.g., one as the tank leader, again replacing the company gunnery sergeant, in the operations section of the tank company headquarters, and two in the company headquarters of an assault amphibian company, one master sergeant as the company gunnery sergeant in the headquarters section and the other as the section leader of the company headquarters AMTRAC Section). In Marine aircraft squadrons MSgts usually serve as SNCOICs of the ordnance and avionics divisions in the aircraft maintenance department. The Aircraft Maintenance Chief/SNCOIC is usually a MGySgt (q.v.), and there are eight aviation-related MSgt billets in each Marine Aviation Logistics Squadron (MALS). (A MALs is organic to each Marine Aircraft Group (MAG) and performs intermediate aviation supply, aircraft maintenance (including aviation life support equipment and avionics), and aviation ordnance support for its supported aircraft squadrons.) Most non-infantry master sergeants serve as section chief/SNCOIC of their MOS type staff section in a battalion or higher level headquarters. General command leadership at this paygrade is provided by the separate rank of first sergeant. Only in the Marine Corps are master sergeants required to be addressed by their full rank. In the Marine Corps, master sergeants may be referred to by the nickname of \\"Top\\". This usage is an informal one, however, and would not be used in an official or formal setting. Use of this nickname by Marines of subordinate rank is at the rank holder's discretion. In the U.S. Armed Forces, all master sergeants (Army, Air Force, and Marine Corps) are senior non-commissioned officers (i.e., pay grades E-7 through E-9). However, in the U.S. Marine Corps, the non-commissioned officer ranks of staff sergeant and above, are classified as Staff Non-Commissioned Officers (SNCOs), a classification that is unique in U.S. usage to the USMC. =U.S. Air Force and U.S. Space Force= The seventh enlisted grade, ranking above technical sergeant and below senior master sergeant. It is abbreviated as MSgt. Advancement to master sergeant is one of the most significant promotions within the enlisted Air Force and Space Force. At the rank of master sergeant, the airman enters the senior non- commissioned tier and transitions his or her duties from front line technicians and supervisors to operational leaders.U.S.A.F. \\"AFI 36-2618, Enlisted Force Structure.\\" 23 March 2012. pg. 14. http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a1/publication/afi36-2618/afi36-2618.pdf An operational leader develops his or her leadership and management skills since this rank carries increased broad leadership, supervisory, and managerial responsibilities rather than technical performance.U.S.A.F. \\"AFI 36-2618, Enlisted Force Structure.\\" 23 March 2012. pg. 5. http://static.e-publishing.af.mil/production/1/af_a1/publication/afi36-2618/afi36-2618.pdf Per Air Force Instruction 36‚Äì2618, master sergeants do serve in positions as squadron superintendents, flight chiefs, section chiefs, and Noncommissioned Officer in Charge (NCOIC). Compared to U.S. Army or U.S. Marine Corps organization, a squadron superintendent or flight chief, and their subordinate section chiefs, are approximately equivalent to platoon sergeants and section/squad leaders, respectively. Also, master sergeants are the lowest rank in the Air Force and Space Force at which one can hold the special duty position and responsibilities of a first sergeant. Air Force first sergeants occupy the pay grades of E-7 through E-9 and are referred to officially as \\"first sergeant\\" regardless of pay grade, and unofficially as \\"first shirt\\" or \\"shirt\\". In 1991, the Air Force changed its NCO insignia so that a maximum of five stripes, or rockers, were placed on the bottom of the chevrons. The master sergeant rank insignia was changed by removing the bottom (sixth) rocker, and relocating it above as a single chevron, on top of the five lower stripes. The single chevron above visually identifies Senior NCO status for E-7 master sergeants along with two chevrons above for E-8 senior master sergeants and three chevrons above for E-9 chief master sergeants in the Air Force NCO insignia. In 2015, the Air Force announced its promotion overhaul and newly established boards for master sergeant.Losey, Steve. \\"Air Force Times. \\"First master sgt. promotion board begins May 27.\\" 27 April 2015. http://www.airforcetimes.com/story/military/careers/air- force/enlisted/2015/04/23/first-master-sgt-promotion-board-begins- may-27/26182531/ Vietnam In the Vietnam People's Army, master sergeant (th∆∞·ª£ng sƒ©) is the highest rank of non-commissioned officer.

According to the I Ching, nine is a yang number; the ninth day of the ninth lunar month (or double nine) has too much yang (a traditional Chinese spiritual concept) and is thus a potentially dangerous date. Hence, the day is also called \\"Double Yang Festival\\" (). To protect against danger, it is customary to climb a high mountain, drink chrysanthemum liquor, and wear the zhuyu () plant, Cornus officinalis. (Both chrysanthemum and zhuyu are considered to have cleansing qualities and are used on other occasions to air out houses and cure illnesses.) On this holiday some Chinese also visit the graves of their ancestors to pay their respects. In Hong Kong and Macao, whole extended families head to ancestral graves to clean them and repaint inscriptions, and to lay out food offerings such as roast suckling pig and fruit, which are then eaten (after the spirits have consumed the spiritual element of the food). Chongyang Cake is also popular. Incense sticks are burned.Chung Yueng Festival, Discover Hong Kong Cemeteries get crowded, and each year grass fires are inadvertently started by the burning incense sticks. Origin Once there was a man named Heng Jing, who believed that a monster would bring pestilence. He told his countrymen to hide on a hill while he went to defeat the monster. Later, people celebrated Heng Jing's defeat of the monster on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month. In 1966, Taiwan rededicated the holiday as \\"Senior Citizens' Day\\", underscoring one custom as it is observed in China, where the festival is also an opportunity to care for and appreciate the elderly. Double Ninth may have originated as a day to drive away danger, but like the Chinese New Year, over time it became a day of celebration. In contemporary times it is an occasion for hiking and chrysanthemum appreciation. Other activities include flying kites, making flower cakes, and welcoming married daughters back home for visiting. Stores sell rice cakes ( \\"gƒÅo\\", a homophone for height ) with mini colorful flags to represent zhuyu. Most people drink chrysanthemum tea, while a few traditionalists drink homemade chrysanthemum wine. Children learn poems about chrysanthemums, and many localities host chrysanthemum exhibits. Mountain climbing races are also popular; winners get to wear a wreath made of zhuyu. In Shandong province people drink spicy radish soup to bring good luck, it comes from an old saying \\" Âñù‰∫ÜËêùÂçúÊ±§ÔºåÂÖ®ÂÆ∂‰∏çÈÅ≠ÊÆÉ\\" (Hƒìle lu√≥bo tƒÅng, qu√°njiƒÅ b√π zƒÅoyƒÅng/Drink the carrot soup, the whole family will not suffer).

It is most commonly celebrated on the 9th day of the 9th month according to the Gregorian calendar rather than the lunar calendar, i.e. on September 9. It is celebrated at both Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples. The festival is celebrated in the wish for the longevity of one's life and is observed by drinking chrysanthemum sake and eating dishes such as chestnut rice or (kuri-gohan) and chestnuts with glutinous rice or (guri-mochi). =Korea= In Korea, the festival is known as Jungyangjeol () and it is celebrated on the 9th day of the 9th month. Koreans would consume chrysanthemum leaves in pancakes. As the festival is meant to celebrate and cultivate good health, outdoor activities such as carrying dogwood, climbing hills or mountains for picnics as well as gazing at chrysanthemum blossoms are carried out.

In Commonwealth countries, the various degrees of sergeant major are appointments held by warrant officers. In the United States, there are also various grades of sergeant major (command sergeant major, Sergeant Major of the Army, Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps), all of the same pay grade of E-9; however, the Sergeant Major of the Army and the Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, as their respective service's Senior Enlisted Advisor, receive a special rate of basic pay that is higher than all other sergeants major. History In 16th century Spain, the sargento mayor (\\"sergeant major\\") was a general officer. He commanded an army's infantry, and ranked about third in the army's command structure; he also acted as a sort of chief of staff to the army's commander. In the 17th century, sergeant majors appeared in individual regiments. These were field officers, third in command of their regiments (after their colonels and lieutenant colonels), with a role similar to the older, army-level sergeant majors (although obviously on a smaller scale). The older position became known as \\"sergeant major general\\" to distinguish it. Over time, the term sergeant was dropped from both titles, giving rise to the modern ranks of major and major general. The full title of sergeant major fell out of use until the latter part of the 18th century, when it began to be applied to the senior non-commissioned officer of an infantry battalion or cavalry regiment. It is about this time that the U.S. and British histories of the title diverge, with the American Revolutionary War. Commonwealth of Nations forces A sergeant major is an appointment, not a rank. It is normally held by the senior warrant officer of an army or marine unit. These appointments are made at several levels, for example: the senior warrant officer of a company, battery or squadron; or the senior warrant officer of a battalion or regiment. The title normally consists of the unit title (e.g. 'company') followed by 'sergeant major', and abbreviated by the initials (e.g. CSM). A sergeant major of a regiment or battalion is known as a regimental sergeant major, rather than a \\"regiment sergeant major\\" or \\"battalion sergeant major\\". The sergeant-major of a unit is responsible to the commanding officer for advising them on matters relating to non-commissioned members (NCMs) of that unit. Sergeant majors are normally addressed as \\"sir\\" or \\"ma'am\\" by subordinates, and as \\"sergeant major\\", by their full title (or its abbreviation), or as \\"Mr\\" or \\"Ms\\" by superiors. In the British Armed Forces, the plural is sergeant majors and not sergeants major as it is in the United States.The earliest usage of \\"sergeant majors\\" in The Times is in 1822. The last of the (very occasional) usages of \\"sergeants major\\", except when referring to American NCOs, is in 1938. =Australia= The most senior warrant officer in the Australian Army holds the unique rank of warrant officer (introduced in 1991 and senior to WO1) and the appointment of Regimental Sergeant Major of the Army (RSM-A). The RSM-A is responsible to the Chief of Army, but responsive to all ranks across the Army. The RSM-A is a member of the personal staff of the Chief of Army. The post of RSM-A has existed since January 1983 and was held by a WO1 until 1991. The RSM-A is the equivalent of the Royal Australian Navy's Warrant Officer of the Navy (WO-N) and the Royal Australian Air Force's Warrant Officer of the Air Force (WOFF- AF). The RSM-A‚Äôs primary role is to represent to the Chief of Army and others, the solicited and unsolicited views, concerns and opinions of soldiers in the army, but also carry the Chief of Army‚Äôs message down and across the ranks. =Canada= Canadian Armed Forces The appointment of sergeant major is given to the senior non-commissioned member within sub-units, units and some formations of the Canadian Army. The regimental sergeant-major is the senior sergeant major in a unit, such as armoured, artillery, engineer, and signal regiments, and infantry and service battalions. This appointment is normally held by a chief warrant officer. Within sub-units (such as armoured squadrons and infantry companies) the sub-unit sergeant-major generally holds the rank of master warrant officer and is known as a squadron or company sergeant major depending and are addressed as \\"Sergeant-Major\\" (ie \\"SSM\\", \\"CSM\\", \\"BSM\\", etc), \\"Mr\\", or \\"Ms\\" by officers and \\"Sir\\" or \\"Ma'am\\" by subordinates with the same conventions are used for regimental sergeants- major. In some unusual cases, a chief petty officer 1st class or chief petty officer 2nd class in the Royal Canadian Navy may succeed to a sergeant-major's position, especially in units with a large number of \\"purple trades\\", such as service battalions. The forms of address generally remain the same, except that chief petty officers 1st and 2nd class are never addressed as \\"Sir\\" or \\"Ma'am\\", but as \\"Chief\\". Sergeants-major do not form part of the formation, unit, or sub-unit chain of command as their role is to advise their commander on matters pertaining to the organization's non-commissioned members. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant major is a rank in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. While technically it is the 6th level of rank, below corps sergeant major and above staff sergeant major, it, along with the other two, are specialized ranks and not part of the normal progression, which would proceed from staff sergeant to inspector. =Singapore= A sergeant major appointment exists in each military unit from company to division/formation. Their main job is to assist the commander in the discipline and welfare of the enlisted men. Their authority and responsibility at parades and ceremonies extends over even commissioned officers while on the parade square. In the Singapore Armed Forces, two kinds of sergeant major exist, a regimental sergeant major and a company sergeant major. A regimental sergeant major may be placed in charge of a battalion, brigade, division or service level. A regimental sergeant major could also be appointed as RSM for a vocation, i.e. infantry vocation/formation sergeant major. This appointment is usually held by a senior warrant officer or a master warrant officer, although at times a 1st warrant officer may be appointed. A company sergeant major may be a 1WO, 2WO and 3WO. Sometimes, a master sergeant or a staff sergeant may be appointed. Military Experts of rank ME 3 could also be sergeant majors, in- charge of logistical units or naval units. This practice is also mirrored in the National Cadet Corps with the master sergeant or staff sergeant being appointed as unit sergeant major. In schools with more than one NCC unit, i.e. having a land as well as a sea unit, an RSM might be appointed from either unit. =Sri Lanka= In Sri Lanka, the rank of sergeant major exists in the Sri Lanka Army and Sri Lanka Police Service. In the army, a warrant officer 2nd class is known as a sergeant major; while a warrant officer 1st class is a regimental sergeant major. In the police, the most senior non-gazetted officer rank is police sergeant major. =South Africa= Warrant officer class 1 rank badge 1921‚Äì2002 Warrant officer class 1 rank badge 1921‚Äì1957 As described above, sergeant-major is not a rank, but an appointment held by a warrant officer class 1 or warrant officer class 2. Regardless of the appointment, the warrant officer is addressed as \\"sergeant-major\\". The rank was established in the Union Defence Forces in 1913, in a single class. The rank badge was a crown, senior appointments being indicated by a wreath around the badge.Radburn, A. (1990) 'South African Military Ranks and Insignia' in Militaria Vol 20 No 2 The rank was divided into two classes in 1921. The national coat of arms was assigned as the badge of the 1st class, and the crown was assigned to the 2nd class. In both classes, senior appointments were indicated by a wreath around the badge. From 1957 to 2002, all warrant officers 1st class wore the wreathed coat of arms, and the warrant officer 2nd class wore the plain coat of arms. Since 2002, all warrant officers have worn the new national coat of arms, the classes and appointments being indicated by the shape of the surrounding frame, and the addition of stars and crossed swords above the arms. Up until 1 June 2008, the highest appointment (level 1), that was held by a warrant officer class 1 was the Sergeant-Major of the South African National Defence Force. Other senior warrant officer appointments up until 1 June 2008 were: * Level 2: Sergeant-Major of the Army * Level 3: Formation sergeant-major * Level 4: Group or base sergeant-major or regimental sergeant-major The South African Air Force had a similar structure for its warrant officers who are also addressed as \\"sergeant-major\\". Starting 1 June 2008, the warrant ranks (Army/ Navy/ Air Force) are: * Master chief warrant officer (formerly level 1)‚Äîe.g. Master Chief Warrant Officer of the South African National Defence Force * Senior chief warrant officer (formerly level 2)‚Äîe.g. Senior Chief Warrant Officer of the South African Army * Chief warrant officer (formerly level 3) * Master warrant officer (formerly level 4A) * Senior warrant officer (formerly level 4) * Warrant officer class one * Warrant officer class two A company/squadron/battery sergeant major should ordinarily be a WO2. =United Kingdom= In the British Army and Royal Marines, company/battery/squadron sergeant major is an appointment for a WO2 and regimental sergeant major is a WO1 appointment. Due to differences in nomenclature between Regiments and Corps, sergeant majors' titles do vary; squadron sergeant major and battery sergeant major for instance would be found in the cavalry and Royal Artillery respectively, and in the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, there are the appointments of artificer sergeant major. Sergeant major instructor is an appointment held by warrant officers class 1 in the Small Arms School Corps and the Army Physical Training Corps and by some WO1s in the Royal Engineers. It is also an appointment held by some of the civilian adult instructors in the Army Cadet Force. A machinist sergeant-major (MSM) is a specialist most often found in the Corps of Royal Engineers or the Royal Army Service Corps, and was the title of one of the major characters in the book and the film based on it, Ice Cold in Alex. For the use of \\"sergeant major\\" as a form of address, see the articles on regimental and company sergeant majors, and that on staff sergeants. The posts of regimental and squadron corporal major are the Household Cavalry's equivalent of sergeant majors, as the Household Cavalry traditionally does not have ranks named sergeant. The Rifles use the spelling \\"serjeant major\\". A new post of Army Sergeant Major was created in 2015. =History= The first British use of the term was around 1680 and was applied to the senior sergeant in the colonel's company of an infantry regiment,Ordnance Insignia of the British Army: Non-Commissioned Ranks & Appointments but it wasn't formalised until 1797, when the sergeant major was added to the battalion or regimental staff. When chevrons were introduced as badges of rank, he wore four, later under a crown. In 1813, cavalry regiments introduced the troop sergeant major to replace the quartermaster as the senior NCO of a troop; this required the existing position to be explicitly redesignated the regimental sergeant major. Later, the rise of the squadron as the principal sub-regimental unit saw the corresponding introduction of the squadron sergeant major. The infantry, however, hung on to the undifferentiated, one-per-battalion sergeant major until the eve of the First World War, when the introduction of the company sergeant major forced them to adopt the RSM title as well. (As an infantry regiment could be, and usually was, made up of a number of battalions, one would logically expect the new title to be battalion sergeant major rather than regimental sergeant major. Perhaps the infantry felt this would imply a lower status than their cavalry equivalents.) In 1881, the cavalry RSM and infantry sergeant major were among a number of senior non-commissioned positions that were confirmed with warrants, making them warrant officers. This was extended and rationalised in 1915, with the introduction of the new ranks of warrant officer class I (WOI) and warrant officer class II (WOII). RSM became an appointment of the former, CSM and SSM of the latter. The Royal Marines continued to use a single rank of sergeant major, equating to warrant officer class I, until after the Second World War, when they adopted the Army system. The Royal Flying Corps and its successor the Royal Air Force used the ranks of sergeant-major class I and II instead of warrant officer class I and II until the 1930s, when the RAF adopted the Army-style ranks. The RAF has not used sergeant major as either a rank or an appointment since that time. France In France, the rank of sergent-major (distinct from the rank of major) was created in 1776. He was the highest ranked non-commissioned officer () in the infantry company; the equivalent in the cavalry was the mar√©chal- des-logis-chef. The sergeant-major was charged with the administration of the company. Under the Ancien Regime, the equivalent at the general staff headquarters of the regiment was the adjudant sous-officiers, a rank which was also established in 1776, who was the senior NCO of the regiment. Following the reforms of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, it became harder to ascend to the officer corps, due to primarily age restrictions. With the addition of an adjudant (warrant officer) in each company, the sergeant-major became limited to purely administrative functions. The rank was replaced with that of sergent-chef in 1928. The rank was re-established from 1942 until 1962 between sergent-chef and adjudant as the NCO in charge of the accounting responsibility of the company. There were no promotions to sergeant-major after 1964 and the rank was formally abolished in 1971. The last NCO to have held the rank retired in 1985. Notable soldiers who held the rank of sergeant- major included Marshal of France Fran√ßois Achille Bazaine, √âdouard Husband, and Henri Tonel. Indonesia The Sergeant Major rank insignia of the Indonesian Army In the Indonesian Armed Forces, the rank is known as sersan mayor and is the most senior sergeant rank. Israel Defense Forces The ◊®◊ë- ◊°◊û◊ú ◊û◊™◊ß◊ì◊ù (Rav samal mitkadem, \\"sergeant major\\") and the ◊®◊ë-◊°◊û◊ú ◊ë◊õ◊ô◊® (Rav samal bakh√≠r, \\"command sergeant major\\") are both non-commissioned officers (◊†◊í◊ì◊ô◊ù) ranks in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Because the IDF is an integrated force, they have a unique rank structure. IDF ranks are the same in all services (army, navy, air force, etc.). The ranks are derived from those of the paramilitary Haganah developed in the British Mandate of Palestine period to protect the Yishuv. This origin is reflected in the slightly- compacted IDF rank structure. United States =United States Army= Sergeant major insignia (U.S. Army) In the U.S. Army, sergeant major (SGM) refers to both a military rank and a personnel slot, or position title. It is the highest enlisted rank, just above first sergeant and master sergeant, with a pay grade of E‚Äì9, NATO rank OR‚Äì9. The leadership variation ‚Äì command sergeant major (CSM) ‚Äì is the senior enlisted advisor to the commanding officer. The leadership position carries with it certain ceremonial functions such as caring for the unit's colors (flag). Additionally, CSMs serve as monitors of, and advocates for, the enlisted soldiers in the command. This position mostly exists in units of battalion size and larger. Because the CSM represents all of the enlisted soldiers in the command, CSMs assigned to units above brigade do not wear the collar insignia of his or her career specialty (e.g., infantry, quartermaster, intelligence, inter alia), but instead wears the CSM (formerly \\"branch immaterial\\") collar insignia. The insignia is a gold-color rendering of the coat of arms of the United States; like the branch of service insignia of all U.S. Army enlisted soldiers, it is placed upon a gold-colored metal disk, one inch in diameter. Both the SGM and CSM are referred to, and addressed as, \\"Sergeant Major\\". The Sergeant Major of the Army is a separate and unique position, but is still addressed as \\"Sergeant Major\\". =United States Marine Corps= Sergeant major insignia (U.S. Marine Corps) In the United States Marine Corps, sergeant major is the ninth and highest enlisted rank, just above first sergeant, and equal in pay grade to master gunnery sergeant, although the two have different responsibilities. Sergeant major is both a rank and a military billet. Marine Corps sergeants major serve as the senior enlisted marine in the Corps' units of battalion, squadron or higher echelon, as the unit commander's senior enlisted advisor and to handle matters of discipline and morale among the enlisted marines. Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps is a separate and unique position. =History= The first official U.S. use of the term was in 1776, when a sergeant major was appointed to the headquarters of each infantry battalion (or regiment, the two designations being used interchangeably) of the Continental Army. The original insignia of rank was an epaulette, or strip, of red cloth sewn on each shoulder of the uniform coat. In the years between 1776 and 1851, the sergeant major rank insignia went through several changes until the \\"classic\\" pattern worn during the Civil War and throughout the Indian Wars was adopted. Generally, these styles included either staff non-commissioned officer (SNCO) epaulettes, chevrons, or a combination of both. (During this period, the rank insignia for the several SNCO ranks of sergeant major, quartermaster sergeant, drum major, and fife major were identical.) In 1821, SNCOs received a single yellow chevron, point up, above the elbow on each sleeve. (Company grade officers, including the new officer grade of \\"adjutant\\", ranking above captain and below major, and non-commissioned officers or NCOs, viz., sergeants and corporals, all received chevrons of various colors, materials, patterns, and placement as their insignia of rank.) In 1825, the sergeant major chevron insignia was changed to be identical to that of the adjutant, by adding an inverted arc below the chevron (very similar in design to the modern private first class insignia), although in a different color (yellow vice gold or silver) and material (worsted vice lace) than that of the officer rank. In 1832, SNCOs returned to a rank insignia denoted by elaborate epaulettes without the chevrons. All SNCOs and NCOs returned to having chevrons as their rank insignia in 1847, when a completely new system of insignia was introduced. This was the first implementation of the three chevrons over three arcs design (with the chevrons worn point-up) of the \\"traditional\\" sergeant major rank insignia. (The quartermaster finally received a distinctive rank insignia‚Äîthree chevrons over three horizontal bars‚Äîand for the first time, the first sergeant, or orderly sergeant, received a distinctive rank insignia‚Äîthree chevrons surmounting a lozenge.) Finally, in 1851, the Army inverted the SNCO and NCO insignia again to be point-down. (Perrenot, 2011)Perrenot. P. United States Army Grade Insignia Since 1776 (2011) The rank was in use by both the Union Army and the Confederate Army during the American Civil War. At that time, it was the highest enlisted rank, being just above quartermaster sergeant. The same rank insignia, three point- down chevrons under three arcs, was used by both armies. Both armies varied the color of the stripes by assigning red for artillery, yellow for cavalry, and blue for infantry. Some Confederate militia units varied these colors even farther and had other colors, including black stripes, for various units. In 1920, with the standardization of the army's enlisted pay grades, it ceased to be a title of rank or grade. However, it survived as the job title of the senior NCO of a battalion and was re-introduced as a rank in 1958 when Congress authorized the E‚Äì8 and E‚Äì9 pay grades (P.L. 85-422, 72 Stat. 122). This new iteration of sergeant major as a discrete grade of rank saw the new rank insignia of three chevrons above three arcs with a five pointed star between the chevrons and arcs. In that law (as amended), the authorized daily average number of enlisted members on active duty in an armed force in pay grade E‚Äì9 in a fiscal year may not be more than 1.25 percent, respectively, of the number of enlisted members of that armed force, subject to certain exceptions. A new insignia was authorized by DA Message 865848, 28 May 1968, for sergeants major assigned at the principal NCO of battalion and higher level command (viz., command sergeants major). This insignia was the same as the sergeant major insignia except the star was small and a wreath was placed around the star. The appointment of Sergeant Major of the Army was created on July 4, 1966 and in 1979 received the unique grade of rank insignia of three chevrons above three arcs with two stars centered between the bottom chevron and the upper arc. In 1994 The insignia for Sergeant Major of the Army was changed to add the Coat of Arms of the United States between the two stars in the center of the insignia. The pin-on insignia is polished gold-plated with a black enamel background. The Institute of Heraldry, History of U.S. Army Enlisted Ranks . Retrieved June 23, 2017. The U.S. Marine Corps' first sergeant major was Archibald Sommers, appointed on January 1, 1801. This was originally a solitary post, similar to the modern Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, but by 1899 there were five sergeants major. The title was abolished in 1946, but re-introduced as a rank in 1954. The post of Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps was established in 1957, as the senior enlisted advisor to the Commandant of the Marine Corps.

First described by E. S. Davenport and Edgar Bain, it is one of the products that may form when austenite (the face-centered cubic crystal structure of iron) is cooled past a temperature where it no longer is thermodynamically stable with respect to ferrite, cementite, or ferrite and cementite. Davenport and Bain originally described the microstructure as being similar in appearance to tempered martensite. A fine non-lamellar structure, bainite commonly consists of cementite and dislocation-rich ferrite. The large density of dislocations in the ferrite present in bainite, and the fine size of the bainite platelets, makes this ferrite harder than it normally would be. The temperature range for transformation of austenite to bainite (125‚Äì550 ¬∞C) is between those for pearlite and martensite. In fact, there is no fundamental lower limit to the bainite-start temperature. When formed during continuous cooling, the cooling rate to form bainite is more rapid than that required to form pearlite, but less rapid than is required to form martensite (in steels of the same composition). Most alloying elements will retard the formation of bainite, though carbon is the most effective in doing so. Aluminium or cobalt are exceptions in that they can accelerate the decomposition of austenite and raise the transformation temperature. The microstructures of martensite and bainite at first seem quite similar, consisting of thin plates which in low- alloy steels cluster together. This is a consequence of the two microstructures sharing many aspects of their transformation mechanisms. However, morphological differences do exist that require a transmission electron microscope to see. Under a light microscope, the microstructure of bainite appears darker than untempered martensite because the bainite has more substructure.Bhadeshia, H. K. D. H. \\"Interpretation of steel microstructures\\". Phase-trans.msm.cam.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2019-03-03. The hardness of bainite can be between that of pearlite and untempered martensite in the same steel hardness. The fact that it can be produced during both isothermal or continuous cooling is a big advantage, because this facilitates the production of large components without excessive additions of alloying elements. Unlike martensitic steels, alloys based on bainite often do not need further heat treatment after transformation in order to optimise strength and toughness. History In the 1920s Davenport and Bain discovered a new steel microstructure which they provisionally called martensite-troostite, due to it being intermediate between the already known low-temperature martensite phase and what was then known as troostite (now fine-pearlite). This microstructure was subsequently named bainite by Bain's colleagues at the United States Steel Corporation, although it took some time for the name to be taken up by the scientific community with books as late as 1947 failing to mention bainite by name. Bain and Davenport also noted the existence of two distinct forms: 'upper-range' bainite which formed at higher temperatures and 'lower-range' bainite which formed near the martensite start temperature (these forms are now known as upper- and lower-bainite respectively). The early terminology was further confused by the overlap, in some alloys, of the lower-range of the pearlite reaction and the upper-range of the bainite with the additional possibility of proeutectoid ferrite. Formation Illustration of a continuous cooling transformation (cct) diagram for a steel alloy Above approximately 900 ¬∞C a typical low-carbon steel is composed entirely of austenite, a high-temperature phase of iron that has a cubic close-packed crystal structure.Bhadeshia, H. K. D. H. \\"The Bravais lattices\\". Phase- trans.msm.cam.ac.uk. Retrieved on 2019-03-03. On cooling, it tends to transform into a mixture of phases, ferrite and cementite, depending on the exact chemical composition. A steel of eutectoid composition will under equilibrium conditions transform into pearlite ‚Äì an interleaved mixture of ferrite and cementite (Fe3C). In addition to the thermodynamic considerations indicated by the phase diagram, the phase transformations in steel are heavily influenced by the chemical kinetics. This is because the diffusion of iron atoms becomes difficult below about 600 ¬∞C under typical processing conditions. As a consequence, a complex array of microstructures occurs when the atomic mobility is limited. This leads to the complexity of steel microstructures which are strongly influenced by the cooling rate. This can be illustrated by a continuous cooling transformation (CCT) diagram which plots the time required to form a phase when a sample is cooled at a specific rate thus showing regions in time-temperature space from which the expected phase fractions can be deduced for a given thermal cycle. If the steel is cooled slowly or isothermally transformed at elevated temperatures, the microstructure obtained will be closer to equilibrium, containing for example of allotriomorphic ferrite, cementite and pearlite. However, the transformation from austenite to pearlite is a time-dependent reconstructive reaction which requires the large scale movement of the iron and carbon atoms. While the interstitial carbon diffuses readily even at moderate temperatures the self-diffusion of iron becomes extremely slow at temperatures below 600 ¬∞C until, for all practical purposes, it stops. As a consequence, a rapidly cooled steel may reach a temperature where pearlite can no longer form despite the reaction being incomplete and the remaining austenite being thermodynamically unstable. Austenite that is cooled sufficiently rapidly to avoid higher temperature transformations, can form martensite, without any diffusion of either iron or carbon, by the deformation of the austenite's face-centred crystal structure into a distorted body-centred tetragonal or body-centred cubic structure. This non-equilibrium phase can only form at low temperatures, where the driving force for the reaction is sufficient to overcome the considerable lattice strain imposed by the transformation. The transformation is essentially time-independent with the phase fraction depending only the degree of cooling below the critical martensite start temperature. Further, it occurs without the diffusion of either substitutional or interstitial atoms and so martensite inherits the composition of the parent austenite. Bainite occupies a region between these two process in a temperature range where iron self-diffusion is limited but there is insufficient driving force to form martensite. The bainite, like martensite, grows without diffusion but some of the carbon then partitions into any residual austenite, or precipitates as cementite. A further distinction is often made between so-called lower-bainite, which forms at temperatures closer to the martensite start temperature, and upper-bainite which forms at higher temperatures. This distinction arises from the diffusion rates of carbon at the temperature at which the bainite is forming. If the temperature is high then the carbon will diffuse rapidly away from the newly formed ferrite and form carbides in the carbon-enriched residual austenite between the ferritic plates leaving them carbide-free. At low temperatures the carbon will diffuse more sluggishly and may precipitate before it can leave the bainitic ferrite. There is some controversy over the specifics of bainite's transformation mechanism; both theories are represented below. =Displacive theory= One of the theories on the specific formation mechanism for bainite is that it occurs by a shear transformation, as in martensite. The crystal structure change is achieved by a deformation rather than by diffusion. The shape change associated with bainite is an invariant‚Äîplane strain with a large shear component. This kind of deformation implies a disciplined motion of atoms (rather than a chaotic transfer associated with diffusion), and is typical of all displacive transformations in steels, for example, martensite, bainite and Widmanstaetten ferrite. There is a strain energy associated with such relief, that leads to the plate shape of the transformation product Any diffusion is subsequent to the diffusionless transformation of austenite, for example the partitioning of carbon from supersaturated bainitic ferrite, or the precipitation of carbides; this is analogous to the tempering of martensite. There are many features of bainite that are correctly predicted by this theory, including: * the plate shape, which is a consequence of the minimisation of strain energy due to the shape deformation accompanying transformation. * The fact that excess carbon is retained inside the even defect-free regions of bainitic ferrite. * The fact that the unit cell of bainitic ferrite can be tetragonal rather than cubic. * The fact that the bainite transformation can be dramatically retarded when the austenite is first plastically deformed, a phenomenon known as mechanical stabilisation, which is unique to displacive transformations. * The obvious fact that displacements occur when bainite grows. The transformation is a combination of deformation and crystal structure change, just like martensite. =Diffusive theory= The diffusive theory of bainite's transformation process is based on the assumption that a bainitic ferrite plate grows with a similar mechanism as Widmanst√§tten ferrite at higher temperatures. Its growth rate thus depends on how rapidly carbon can diffuse from the growing ferrite into the austenite. A common misconception is that this mechanism excludes the possibility of coherent interfaces and a surface relief. In fact it is accepted by some that formation of Widmanst√§tten ferrite is controlled by carbon diffusion and do show a similar surface relief. =Morphology= Typically bainite manifests as aggregates, termed sheaves, of ferrite plates (sub-units) separated by retained austenite, martensite or cementite. While the sub-units appear separate when viewed on a 2-dimensional section they are in fact interconnected in 3-dimensions and usually take on a lenticular plate or lath morphology. The sheaves themselves are wedge-shaped with the thicker end associated with the nucleation site. The thickness of the ferritic plates is found to increase with the transformation temperature. Neural network models have indicated that this is not a direct effect of the temperature per se but rather a result of the temperature dependence of the driving force for the reaction and the strength of the austenite surrounding the plates. At higher temperatures, and hence lower undercooling, the reduced thermodynamic driving force causes a decrease in the nucleation rate which allows individual plates to grow larger before they physically impinge on each other. Further, the growth of the plates must be accommodated by plastic flow in the surrounding austenite which is difficult if the austenite is strong and resists the plate's growth. =Upper bainite= \\"Upper bainite\\" forms around 400‚Äì550 ¬∞C in sheaves. These sheaves contain several laths of ferrite that are approximately parallel to each other and which exhibit a Kurdjumov-Sachs relationship with the surrounding austenite, though this relationship degrades as the transformation temperature is lowered. The ferrite in these sheaves has a carbon concentration below 0.03%, resulting in carbon-rich austenite around the laths. The amount of cementite that forms between the laths is based on the carbon content of the steel. For a low carbon steel, typically discontinuous \\"stringers\\" or small particles of cementite will be present between laths. For steel with a higher carbon content, the stringers become continuous along the length of the adjacent laths. =Lower bainite= Lower bainite forms between 250 and 400 ¬∞C and takes a more plate-like form than upper bainite. There are not nearly as many low angle boundaries between laths in lower bainite. In lower bainite, the habit plane in ferrite will also shift from <111> towards <110> as transformation temperature decreases. In lower bainite, cementite nucleates on the interface between ferrite and austenite. =Incomplete transformation= In the present context, \\"incomplete transformation\\" refers to the fact that in the absence of carbide precipitation, the bainite reaction stops well before the austenite reaches its equilibrium or paraequilibrium chemical composition. It stops at the point where the free energies of austenite and ferrite of identical composition become the same, i.e. transformation without a change in chemical composition of the participating phases becomes thermodynamically impossible. Early research on bainite found that at a given temperature only a certain volume fraction of the austenite would transform to bainite with the remainder decomposing to pearlite after an extended delay. This was the case despite the fact that a complete austenite to pearlite transformation could be achieved at higher temperatures where the austenite was more stable. The fraction of bainite that could form increased as the temperature decreased. This was ultimately explained by accounting for the fact that when the bainitic ferrite formed the supersaturated carbon would be expelled to the surrounding austenite thus thermodynamically stabilising it against further transformation. =Difference between martensite and bainite= Bainite can essentially be regarded as martensite that tempers during the course of transformation. It forms at a higher temperature than martensite, and even the latter can autotemper. Because the transformation temperature is higher, the austenite itself is mechanically weak so that the shape deformation due to bainite is relaxed by the plastic deformation of the adjacent austenite. As a consequence, the growing plate of bainite is confronted by a forest of dislocations that eventually terminates its growth even before the plate has hit an austenite grain boundary. Plates of bainite can therefore be smaller than those of martensite in the same steel. The transformation then proceeds by a sub-unit mechanism involving the successive nucleation of new plates. Applications Bainite-rich steel shafts Bainite-rich steel roll With increasing bainite content in steel, the hardness, yield and tensile strength remain almost constant for bainite content up to 50%, and then increase by ca. 30%. Hence meter-size shafts and plates of high-bainite steels have been commercially mass-produced by Rolls-Royce Holdings and Tata Steel.

It is used for fire suppression, especially for expensive equipment. Brominated haloalkanes were first used during World War II in fire extinguishers for aircraft and tanks. BCF was introduced as an effective gaseous fire suppression agent in the mid-1960s for use around highly valuable materials in places such as museums, mainframe rooms, and telecommunication switching centers. BCFs were also widely used in the maritime industries in the engine rooms of ships and also in the transport industry in vehicles. Its efficiency as a fire extinguishing agent has also led it to be the predominant choice of fire extinguishing agent on commercial aircraft and is typically found in cylindrical hand-held canisters. Its advantages as a fire extinguishing agent are that it has lower toxicity than chemicals such as carbon tetrachloride and that since it is a covalently bonded compound, it does not form conductive ions, therefore being usable on electrical equipment.

In contrast, a chord is in open harmony (also called open position or open structure) if there is more than an octave between the top and bottom notes. The more general term spacing describes how far apart the notes in a chord are voiced. A triad in close harmony has compact spacing, while one in open harmony has wider spacing. Close harmony or voicing can refer to both instrumental and vocal arrangements. It can follow the standard voice-leading rules of classical harmony, as in string quartets or Bach chorales, or proceed in parallel motion with the melody in thirds or sixths.  Vocal music  Origins of this style of singing are found in harmonies of the 1800s in America. Early radio quartets continued this tradition. Female harmonists, like The Boswell Sisters (\\"Mood Indigo\\", 1933) and The Hamilton Sisters and Fordyce (\\"Who? You That's Who!\\", 1927), who then became Three X Sisters, performed and recorded this style in the 1920s, and continued it on commercial radio of the 1930s. Close harmony singing was especially popular in the 1940s with pop and R&B; groups using the technique quite frequently. The Andrews Sisters also capitalized on a similar style with swing music. Many gospel and soul groups in the 1950s and 60s also used this technique, usually 3- or 4-part SSAA or TTBB harmony with one person (either bass or lead) doing a call-and-response type lead. Examples of this are The Blind Boys of Alabama, a group that is still recording today. The folk-rock duo Simon & Garfunkel used close harmony, echoing their chosen role-models, The Everly Brothers. The Louvin Brothers were a duo that used close harmony in the genre of country music. Barbershop harmony has a unique TTBB structure: the melody is in the 2nd tenor or \\"lead\\" voice, while the 1st tenor takes the next part up, usually in 3rds, with the baritone and bass voices supporting. The bass line tends to be more rhythmic and covers the root notes of the harmonic progression, providing more \\"support\\" and independence than in classical vocal music, since Barbershop is usually sung a cappella. Barbershop can be sung by males (TTBB) or females (SSAA). Public domain pieces, such as \\"Sweet Adeline\\", and newer pieces are abundant. National organizations promote the music with local chapters in many communities. Soul and gospel groups flourished in America in the years after World War II, building on the foundation of blues, 1930s gospel songs and big band music. Originally called \\"race music\\" by white mainstream radio and its target market, it was the precursor to rock and roll and rhythm and blues of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, influencing many English and American artists of that era. They often used the more traditional TTBB or SSAA 4-part structure, but with heavy use of solos and call-and-response, which is rooted in the African American church. These groups sometimes sang a cappella but also used instrumental backing, especially when recorded by the bigger labels. Pop music and doo-wop can be seen as a commercialization of this genre.  Instrumental music  Impressionist composers like Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel often used close harmony in their works and other intervals, such as 7ths, 9ths, and 11ths may be used since the chords have four or more notes and the harmonies are more complex. In jazz, this influence flowered in the works of George Gershwin and Duke Ellington. A well-known example of consistent instrumental close harmony is Glenn Miller's \\"Moonlight Serenade\\" which uses the full range of single-reed wind instruments (soprano clarinet, alto, tenor, and baritone saxophones) to make a distinctive sound by harmonizing the different sections all within a single octave. Miller studied the Schillinger technique with Joseph Schillinger,\\"Joseph Schillinger, the forgotten Guru \\", The Schillinger School of Music. who is credited with helping Miller create the \\"Miller sound\\", and under whose tutelage he himself composed what became his signature theme, \\"Moonlight Serenade\\".\\"Who Is Joseph Schillinger?\\", The Schillinger System. Block harmony In organ performance, block harmony means that close position chords are added below the melody in the right hand, and the left hand doubles the melody an octave lower, while in open harmony the middle note of the chord is played an octave lower creating an \\"open\\" space in the chord.Shanaphy, Edward and Knowlton, Joseph (1990).

Like many mordant dyes, it features the azo group (RN=NR) and various sites for chelating to metal cations. A French Indienne, a printed or painted textile in the manner of Indian productions, which used mordants to fix the dyes A mordant or dye fixative is a substance used to set (i.e. bind) dyes on fabrics by forming a coordination complex with the dye, which then attaches to the fabric (or tissue). It may be used for dyeing fabrics or for intensifying stains in cell or tissue preparations. Although mordants are still used, especially by small batch dyers, it has been largely displaced in industry by directs.Klaus Hunger, Peter Mischke, Wolfgang Rieper, Roderich Raue, Klaus Kunde, Aloys Engel: \\"Azo Dyes\\" in Ullmann‚Äôs Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.. The term mordant comes from the Latin mordere, \\"to bite\\". In the past, it was thought that a mordant helped the dye bite onto the fiber so that it would hold fast during washing. A mordant is often a polyvalent metal ion, often chromium(III). The resulting coordination complex of dye and ion is colloidal and can be either acidic or alkaline. Common dye mordants Mordants include tannic acid, alum, chrome alum, sodium chloride, and certain salts of aluminium, chromium, copper, iron, iodine, potassium, sodium, tungsten, and tin. KAl(SO4)2 12 H2O Iodine is often referred to as a mordant in Gram stains, but is in fact a trapping agent. Dyeing methods Dye rot from iron mordant The three methods used for mordanting are: * Pre-mordanting (onchrome): The substrate is treated with the mordant and then the dye. The complex between the mordant and dye is formed on the fibre. * Meta-mordanting (metachrome): The mordant is added in the dye bath itself. The process is simpler than pre- or post-mordanting, but is applicable to only a few dyes. Mordant red 19 shown above is applied in this manner * Post-mordanting (afterchrome): The dyed material is treated with a mordant. The complex between the mordant and dye is formed on the fibre. The type of mordant used affects the shade obtained after dyeing and also affects the fastness property of the dye. The application of mordant, either pre-mordant, meta-mordant or post-mordant methods, is influenced by: * The action of the mordant on the substrate: if the mordant and dye methods are harsh (for example, an acidic mordant with an acidic dye), pre-mordanting or post-mordanting limits the potential for damage to the substrate. * The stability of the mordant or dye lake or both: the formation of a stable dye lake means that the mordant can be added in the dye without risk of losing the dye properties (meta-mordanting). Dye results can also rely on the mordant chosen as the introduction of the mordant into the dye will have a marked effect on the final color. Each dye can have different reactions to each mordant. For example, cochineal scarlet, or Dutch scarlet as it came to be known, used cochineal along with a tin mordant to create a brilliant orange-hued red.Phipps, Elena (2010). Cochineal Red The Art History of a Color, p34. Yale University Press, New Haven and London. . Residual iron mordant can damage or fade fabric, producing \\"dye rot\\". =Dye lake= The dye lake is an insoluble complex formed upon combining the dye and mordant, which then attaches to the substrate. Mordants increase the fastness of the dye since the higher molecular weight dye is now bonded to the fibre. The type of mordant used can change the colour of both the dye-plus-mordant solution and influence the shade of the final product. =Wool= Unlike cotton, wool is highly receptive toward mordants. Due to its amphoteric nature wool can absorb acids and bases with equal efficiency. When wool is treated with a metallic salt it hydrolyses the salt into an acidic and basic component. The basic component is absorbed at ‚ÄìCOOH group and the acidic component is removed during washing. Wool also has a tendency to absorb fine precipitates from solutions; these cling to the surface of fibres and dye particles attached to these contaminants result in poor rubbing fastness. The discovery of Congo red in 1883, followed by many other synthetic azo dyes, heralded the demise of mordant dyes. =Silk= Like wool, silk is also amphoteric and can absorb both acids and bases. However, wool has thio groups (-SH) from the cystine amino acid, which act as reducing agent and can reduce hexavalent chromium of potassium dichromate to trivalent form. The trivalent chromium forms the complex with the fibre and dye. Therefore, potassium dichromate cannot be used effectively as mordant. =Animal and plant tissues= In histology, mordants are indispensable in fixing dyes to tissues for microscopic examination. Methods for mordant application depend on the desired stain and tissues under study; pre-, meta- and post-mordanting techniques are used as required. The most commonly used stain used in diagnostic histology of animal tissues is Harris' haematoxylin as part of a haematoxylin and eosin (H&E;) stain.

The note was delivered on November 26, 1941, and is named for Secretary of State Cordell Hull. It was the culmination of a series of events leading to the attack on Pearl Harbor. It was considered by the Japanese as an ultimatum for Japan to withdraw from China and other occupied territories, and was perceived by the Japanese Government at the time and many historians around the world as a casus belli. Background The United States objected to the Second Sino-Japanese War and the occupation of part of China by Japanese troops. In protest, the United States sent support to the Nationalist government of Chiang Kai-shek. In July 1941, Japanese military units occupied southern French Indochina, violating a gentlemen's agreement. Japanese bombers quickly moved into bases in Saigon and Cambodia, from which they could attack British Malaya. As a result, immediately after the Japanese military occupation, the US government imposed trade sanctions on Japan, including the freezing of Japanese assets in the United States and an embargo of oil exports to Japan. Dean Acheson, a senior State Department official, was the key decision maker. He shifted American policy away from export restrictions and toward \\"full-blooded financial warfare against Japan.\\" The expected result was the financial freeze, which Miller described as \\"the most devastating American action against Japan.\\"Edward S. Miller, Bankrupting the Enemy: The U.S. Financial Siege of Japan before Pearl Harbor (Annapolis: Naval Institute Press, 2007) pp 108, 1 Final attempts at peace On November 5, 1941, Emperor Hirohito approved, in Imperial Conference, the plan for the attack on Pearl Harbor.Peter Wetzler, Hirohito and War, 1998, p.39 At the same time, his government made a last effort to arrive at a diplomatic solution of their differences with the United States. Ambassador Kichisabur≈ç Nomura presented two proposals to the American government. The first, Proposal A, was presented by him on November 6, 1941. It proposed making a final settlement of the Sino-Japanese War with a partial withdrawal of Japanese troops. United States military intelligence had deciphered some of Japan's diplomatic codes so they knew that there was a second proposal in case it failed. The United States government stalled and then rejected it on November 14, 1941. On November 20, 1941, Nomura presented Proposal B, which offered to withdraw Japanese forces from southern Indochina if the United States agreed to end aid to the Nationalist Chinese, freeze military deployments in Southeast Asia (except for Japan's reinforcement of northern Indochina), provide Japan with \\"a required quantity of oil,\\" and assist Japan in acquiring materials from the Dutch East Indies.\\"Draft Proposal Handed by the Japanese Ambassador (Nomura) To the Secretary of State,\\" November 20, 1941 The United States was about to make a counteroffer to this plan, which included a monthly supply of fuel for civilian use. However, President Franklin D. Roosevelt received a leak of Japan's war plan and news that Japanese troopships were on their way to Indochina. He then decided that the Japanese were not being sincere in their negotiations and instructed Secretary Hull to drop the counterproposal.Henry Stimson diary, November 26, 1941 By November 26, top American officials at the White House, State, Navy and War departments knew that Japan was moving invasion forces toward Thailand. They also knew that the Japanese foreign ministry had put an absolute deadline on negotiations of November 29 because \\"after that things are automatically going to happen.\\" The Americans were convinced that war would start in a matter of days, probably with a surprise Japanese attack. The previous plan, to present Japan with a temporary modus vivendi, was strongly opposed by China and Britain and dropped.Robert Dallek, Franklin D. Roosevelt and American foreign policy, 1932-1945 (Oxford University Press, 1979) pp 307-8 Content The Hull Note constists of 2 sections. The first section is a \\"Draft mutual declaration of policy\\" by stating these principles: # inviolability of territorial integrity and sovereignty of each and all nations. # non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. # equality, including equality of commercial opportunity and treatment. # reliance upon international cooperation and conciliation for the prevention and pacific settlement of controversies # non- discrimination in international commercial relations. # international economic cooperation and abolition of extreme nationalism as expressed in excessive trade restrictions. # non-discriminatory access by all nations to raw material supplies. # full protection of the interests of consuming countries and populations as regards the operation of international commodity agreements. # establishment of such institutions and arrangements of international finances The second section consists of 10 points and is titled \\"Steps to be taken by the Government of the United States and by the Government of Japan\\" # multilateral non-aggression pact among the British Empire, China, Japan, the Netherlands, the Soviet Union, Thailand and the United States # pledge itself to respect the territorial integrity of French Indochina # withdraw of all military, naval, air and police forces from China and from Indo-China # no support (militarily, politically, economically) of any Government or regime in China other than the national Government of the Republic of China # Both Governments to give up all extraterritorial rights in China # enter into negotiations for the conclusion between the United States and Japan of a trade agreement, based upon reciprocal most favored-nation treatment # remove the freezing restrictions on Japanese funds in the United States and on American funds in Japan # agree upon a plan for the stabilization of the dollar-yen rate # no agreement with any third powers to conflict with the fundamental purpose of this agreement # influence other Governments to adhere to the basic political and economic principles in this agreement Delivery to and Reception by the Japanese Government On November 26, 1941, Hull presented the Japanese ambassador with the Hull note, which, as one of its conditions, demanded the complete withdrawal of all Japanese troops from French Indochina and China. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Hideki said to his cabinet that \\"this is an ultimatum.\\"PEARL HARBOUR ATTACK - 7 December 1941, solarnavigator.net Final decision made to attack The strike force that attacked Pearl Harbor had set sail the day before, on the morning of November 26, 1941, Japan time, which was November 25, Washington time. It could have been recalled along the way, but no further diplomatic progress was made. At an Imperial Conference on December 1, Emperor Hirohito approved attacks against the United States, the British Empire and the Dutch colonial empire. On December 4, President Roosevelt was warned by a 26-page ONI memo that the Japanese were showing particular interest in the (US) West Coast, the Panama Canal and the Territory of Hawaii. On December 7‚Äì8 the Japanese began attacks against the Philippines, Guam, Wake Island, Malaya, Singapore, Hong Kong and Hawaii. Interpretations In 1948, historian Charles A. Beard argued that the note was an ultimatum which meant unnecessary war. He suggested that at the time the note was delivered, Roosevelt and his advisors were actively planning for war and seeking to provoke the Japanese to attack first.Charles A. Beard, President Roosevelt and the Coming of the War 1941 (Yale UP, 1948) ch 9, pp 574-75. Some modern Japanese commentators say that the note was designed to draw Japan into war in such a way as to allow Japan to be presented as the aggressor nation. Toshio Tamogami, who was the Japan Air Self-Defense Force chief of staff, was forcibly retired by the Japanese government in 2008 for taking this position.See Tamogami's controversial essay According to Benn Steil, director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, while \\"no single individual can be said to have triggered\\" the Pearl Harbor attack, Harry Dexter White \\"was the author of the key ultimatum demands\\". Steil also maintains \\"the Japanese government made the decision to move forward with the Pearl Harbor strike after receiving the ultimatum.\\"Steil, Benn (2013), The Battle of Bretton Woods: John Maynard Keynes, Harry Dexter White, and the Making of a New World Order, Princeton University Press, p. 55 See also *Japanese declaration of war on the United States and the British Empire * McCollum memo * War Plan Orange Notes References * Costello, John, The Pacific War 1941-1945 (New York: William Morrow, 1982) * Dallek, Robert.

National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa Black Spruce and Maple, Fall 1915. Sketch. Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto Thomas John Thomson (August 5, 1877July 8, 1917) was a Canadian artist active in the early 20th century. During his short career he produced roughly 400 oil sketches on small wood panels along with around 50 larger works on canvas. His works consist almost entirely of landscapes depicting trees, skies, lakes, and rivers. His paintings use broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's accidental death at 39 by drowning came shortly before the founding of the Group of Seven and is seen as a tragedy for Canadian art. Raised in rural Ontario, Thomson was born into a large family of farmers and displayed no immediate artistic talent. He worked several jobs before attending a business college, eventually developing skills in penmanship and copperplate writing. At the turn of the 20th century, he was employed in Seattle and Toronto as a pen artist at several different photoengraving firms, including Grip Ltd. There he met those who eventually formed the Group of Seven, including J. E. H. MacDonald, Lawren Harris, Frederick Varley, Franklin Carmichael and Arthur Lismer. In May 1912, he visited Algonquin Park‚Äîa major public park and forest reservation in Central Ontario‚Äîfor the first time. It was there that he acquired his first sketching equipment and, following MacDonald's advice, began to capture nature scenes. He became enraptured with the area and repeatedly returned, typically spending his winters in Toronto and the rest of the year in the Park. His earliest paintings were not outstanding technically, but showed a good grasp of composition and colour handling. His later paintings vary in composition and contain vivid colours and thickly applied paint. His later work has had a great influence on Canadian art‚Äîpaintings such as The Jack Pine and The West Wind have taken a prominent place in the culture of Canada and are some of the country's most iconic works. Thomson developed a reputation during his lifetime as a veritable outdoorsman, talented in both fishing and canoeing, although his skills in the latter have been contested. The circumstances of his drowning on Canoe Lake in Algonquin Park, linked with his image as a master canoeist, led to unsubstantiated but persistent rumours that he had been murdered or committed suicide. Although he died before the formal establishment of the Group of Seven, Thomson is often considered an unofficial member. His art is typically exhibited with the rest of the Group's, nearly all of which remains in Canada‚Äîmainly at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound. Life =Early years= Thomas John \\"Tom\\" Thomson was born on August 5, 1877, in Claremont, Ontario, the sixth of John and Margaret Thomson's ten children. He was raised in Leith, Ontario, near Owen Sound, in the municipality of Meaford. Thomson and his siblings enjoyed both drawing and painting, although he did not immediately display any major talents. He was eventually taken out of school for a year because of ill health, including a respiratory problem variously described as \\"weak lungs\\" or \\"inflammatory rheumatism\\"., quoted in . This gave him free time to explore the woods near his home and develop an appreciation of nature. The family were unsuccessful as farmers; both Thomson and his father often abandoned their chores to go hiking, hunting and fishing. Thomson regularly went on walks with Dr. William Brodie (1831‚Äì1909), his grandmother's first cousin. Brodie was a well-known entomologist, ornithologist and botanist, and Thomson's sister Margaret later recounted that they collected specimens on long walks together. Thomson was also enthusiastic about sports, once breaking his toe while playing football. He was an excellent swimmer and fisherman, inheriting his passion for the latter from his grandfather and father. Like most of those in his community, he regularly attended church. Some stories say that he sketched in the hymn books during services and entertained his sisters with caricatures of their neighbours. His sisters later said that they had fun \\"guessing who they were\\", indicating that he was not necessarily adept at capturing people's likeness. Portrait of a young Tom Thomson, Each of Thomson's nine siblings received an inheritance from their paternal grandfather. Thomson received $2000 in 1898 but seems to have spent it quickly. A year later, he entered a machine shop apprenticeship at an iron foundry owned by William Kennedy, a close friend of his father, but left only eight months later. Also in 1899, he volunteered to fight in the Second Boer War, but was turned down because of a medical condition. He tried to enlist for the Boer War three times in all, but was denied each time. In 1901, Thomson enrolled at Canada Business College in Chatham, Ontario. The school advertised instruction in stenography, bookkeeping, business correspondence and \\"plain and ornamental penmanship\\". There, he developed abilities in penmanship and copperplate‚Äînecessary skills for a clerk. After graduating at the end of 1901, he travelled briefly to Winnipeg before leaving for Seattle in January 1902, joining his older brother, George Thomson. George and cousin F. R. McLaren had established the Acme Business School in Seattle, listed as the 11th largest business school in the United States. Thomson worked briefly as an elevator operator at The Diller Hotel. By 1902, two more of his brothers, Ralph and Henry, had moved west to join the family's new school. =Graphic design work= Seattle (1901‚Äì04) After studying at the business school for six months, Thomson was hired at Maring & Ladd as a pen artist, draftsman and etcher. He mainly produced business cards, brochures and posters, as well as three-colour printing. Having previously learned calligraphy, he specialized in lettering, drawing and painting. While working at Maring & Ladd, he was known to be stubborn; his brother Fraser wrote that, instead of completing his work according to the direction provided, he would use his own design ideas, which angered his boss. Thomson may have also worked as a freelance commercial designer, but there are no extant examples of such work. He eventually moved on to a local engraving company. Despite a good salary he left by the end of 1904. He quickly returned to Leith, possibly prompted by a rejected marriage proposal after his brief summer romance with Alice Elinor Lambert. Lambert, who never married, later became a writer; in one of her stories, she describes a young girl who refuses an artist's proposal and later regrets her decision. Toronto (1905‚Äì12) Profile of Thomson wearing a suit and hat, . During this time, Thomson was known to dress well and spend his money on nice clothes and fine dining. Thomson moved to Toronto in the summer of 1905. His first job upon his return to Canada was at the photo-engraving firm Legg Brothers, earning $11 a week. He spent his free time reading poetry and going to concerts, the theatre and sporting events. In a letter to an aunt, he wrote, \\"I love poetry best.\\" Friends described him during this time as \\"periodically erratic and sensitive, with fits of unreasonable despondency\\". Apart from buying art supplies, he spent his money on expensive clothes, fine dining and tobacco. Around this time, he may have studied briefly with William Cruikshank, a British artist who taught at the Ontario College of Art. Cruikshank was likely Thomson's only art instructor. In 1908 or 1909, Thomson joined Grip Ltd., a firm in Toronto that specialized in design and lettering work. Grip was the leading graphic-design company in the country and introduced Art Nouveau, metal engraving and the four-colour process to Canada. Albert Robson, then the art director at Grip, recalled that Thomson's early work at the firm was mostly in lettering and decorative designs for booklets and labels., quoted in . He wrote that Thomson made friends slowly but eventually found similar interests to his coworkers., quoted in . Several of the employees at Grip had been members of the Toronto Art Students' League, a group of newspaper artists, illustrators and commercial artists active between 1886 and 1904. The members sketched in parts of eastern Canada and published an annual calendar with illustrations depicting Canadian history and rural life. The senior artist at Grip, J. E. H. MacDonald, encouraged his staff to paint outside in their spare time to better hone their skills. It was at Grip that many of the eventual members of the Group of Seven would meet. In December 1910, artist William Smithson Broadhead was hired, joined by Arthur Lismer in February 1911. Robson eventually hired Frederick Varley, followed by Franklin Carmichael in April 1911. Although Thomson was not himself a member, it was at the Arts and Letters Club that MacDonald introduced Thomson to Lawren Harris. The club was considered the \\"centre of living culture in Toronto\\", providing an informal environment for the artistic community. Every member of what would become the original Group of Seven had now met. MacDonald left Grip in November 1911 to do freelance work and spend more time painting, after the Ontario government purchased his canvas By the River (Early Spring) (1911).

Watercolour, graphite and ink on paper. McMichael Canadian Art Collection, Kleinburg =Painting career= Exploring Algonquin Park (1912‚Äì13) Thomson fishing in Algonquin Park, 1914‚Äì16. He was enamoured with the Park, and many of his works were painted in the area. Algonquin Park was established in 1893 by Oliver Mowat and the Ontario Legislature. Covering eighteen rectangular townships in Central Ontario, the Park was created to provide a space dedicated to recreation, wildlife and watershed protection, though logging operations continued to be permitted. Thomson learned of the Park from fellow artist Tom McLean. In May 1912, aged 34, he first visited the Park, venturing through the area on a canoe trip with his Grip colleague H. B. (Ben) Jackson. Together, they took the Grand Trunk Railway from Toronto to Scotia Junction, then transferred to the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway, arriving at Canoe Lake Station. McLean introduced Thomson to the Park superintendent, G. W. Barlett. Thomson and Jackson later met ranger Harry (Bud) Callighen while they camped nearby on Smoke Lake. It was also at this time that Thomson acquired his first sketching equipment. He did not yet take painting seriously. According to Jackson, Thomson did not think \\"his work would ever be taken seriously; in fact, he used to chuckle over the idea\\". Instead, they spent most of their time fishing, except for \\"a few notes, skylines and colour effects\\". During the same trip, Thomson read Izaak Walton's 1653 fishing guide The Compleat Angler. Primarily a fisherman's bible, the book also provided a philosophy of how to live, similar to the one described in Henry David Thoreau's 1854 book Walden, or Life in the Woods, a reflection on simple living in natural surroundings. His time in Algonquin Park gave him an ideal setting to imitate Walton's \\"contemplative\\" life. Ben Jackson wrote: Upon returning to Toronto, Jackson published an article about his and Thomson's experience in the Park in the Toronto Sunday World, included in which were several illustrations. After this initial experience, Thomson and another colleague, William Broadhead, went on a two-month expedition, going up the Spanish River and into Mississagi Forest Reserve (today Mississagi Provincial Park). Thomson's transition from commercial art towards his own original style of painting became apparent around this time. Much of his artwork from this trip, mainly oil sketches and photographs, was lost during two canoe spills; the first was on Green Lake in a rain squall and the second in a series of rapids. In fall 1912, Albert Robson, Grip's art director, moved to the design firm Rous & Mann. A month after returning to Toronto, Thomson followed Robson and left Grip to join Rous & Mann too. They were soon joined by Varley, Carmichael and Lismer. Robson later spoke favourably of Thomson's loyalty, calling him \\"a most diligent, reliable and capable craftsman\\". Robson's success in attracting great talent was well understood. Employee Leonard Rossell believed that the key to Robson's success \\"was that the artists felt that he was interested in them personally and did all he could to further their progress. Those who worked there were all allowed time off to pursue their studies ... Tom Thomson, so far as I know, never took definite lessons from anyone, yet he progressed quicker than any of us. But what he did was probably of more advantage to him. He took several months off in the summer and spent them in Algonquin Park.\\", quoted in . Northern Lake, Winter 1912‚Äì13. 71.7 x 102.4 cm. Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto In October, MacDonald introduced Thomson to Dr. James MacCallum. A frequent visitor to the Ontario Society of Artists' (OSA) exhibitions, MacCallum was admitted to the Arts and Letters Club in January 1912. There, he met artists such as John William Beatty, Arthur Heming, MacDonald and Harris. MacCallum eventually persuaded Thomson to leave Rous and Mann and start a painting career. In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\". After Thomson's death, MacCallum helped preserve and advocated for his work. Thomson accepted MacCallum's offer under the same terms offered to Jackson. He travelled around Ontario with his colleagues, especially to the wilderness of Ontario, which was to become a major source of inspiration. Regarding Algonquin Park, he wrote in a letter to MacCallum: \\"The best I can do does not do the place much justice in the way of beauty.\\" He ventured to rural areas near Toronto and tried to capture the surrounding nature. He may have worked as a fire ranger on the Mattagami reserve. Addison and Little suggest that he guided fishing tours, although Hill finds this unlikely since Thomson had only spent a few weeks in the Park the previous year. Thomson became as familiar with logging scenes as with nature in the Park and painted them both. While returning to Toronto in November 1912, Thomson stopped in Huntsville. The visit was possibly to meet with Winifred Trainor, a woman whose family owned a cottage on Canoe Lake in Algonquin Park. Trainor was later rumoured to have been engaged to Thomson with a wedding planned for the late 1917, although little is known about their relationship. Thomson first exhibited with the OSA in March 1913, selling his painting Northern Lake (1912‚Äì13) to the Ontario Government for $250 (). The sale afforded him time to paint and sketch through the summer and fall of 1913. File:Thomson, Old Lumber Dam, Algonquin Park.jpgOld Lumber Dam, Algonquin Park, Spring 1912. Sketch.

Private collection File:Thomson, Evening 1913.jpgEvening, Fall 1913. Sketch. Thomson Collection, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto Early recognition (1914‚Äì15) Studio Building in Toronto, where Thomson lived and worked from January 1914 through November 1915 Thomson often experienced self-doubt. A. Y. Jackson recalled that in the fall of 1914, Thomson threw his sketch box into the woods out of frustration, and was \\"so shy he could hardly be induced to show his sketches\\". Harris expressed similar sentiments, writing that Thomson \\"had no opinion of his own work\\", and would even throw burnt matches at his paintings. Several of the canvases he sent to exhibitions remained unsigned. If someone praised one of his sketches, he immediately gave it to them as a gift. A turning point in his career came in 1914, when the National Gallery of Canada, under the directorship of Eric Brown, began to acquire his paintings. Although the money was not enough to live on, the recognition was unheard of for an unknown artist. For several years he shared a studio and living quarters with fellow artists, initially living in the Studio Building with Jackson in January 1914. Jackson described the Studio Building as \\"a lively centre for new ideas, experiments, discussions, plans for the future and visions of an art inspired by the Canadian countryside\\". It was there that Thomson, \\"after much self-deprecation, finally submitted to becoming a full- time artist\\"., quoted in . They split the rent‚Äî$22 a month‚Äîon the ground floor while construction on the rest of the building was finished. After Jackson moved out in December to go to Montreal, Carmichael took his place. Thomson and Carmichael shared a studio space through the winter. On March 3, 1914, Thomson was nominated as a member of the OSA by Lismer and T. G. Greene. He was elected on the 17th. He did not participate in any of their activities beyond sending paintings for annual exhibitions. Harris described Thomson's strange working hours years later: Thomson with his catch at Canoe Lake, Algonquin Park, In late April 1914, Thomson arrived in Algonquin Park, where he was joined by Lismer on May 9. They camped on Molly's Island in Smoke Lake, travelling to Canoe, Smoke, Ragged, Crown and Wolf Lakes. He spent his spring and summer divided between Georgian Bay and Algonquin Park, visiting James MacCallum by canoe. His travels during this time have proved difficult to discern, with such a large amount of ground covered in such a short time, painting the French River, Byng Inlet, Parry Sound and Go-Home Bay from May 24 through August 10. H. A. Callighen, a park ranger, wrote in his journal that Thomson and Lismer left Algonquin Park on May 24. By May 30, Thomson was at Parry Sound and on June 1 was camped at the French River with MacCallum. Art historian Joan Murray noted that Thomson was at Go-Home Bay for the next two months, or at least until August 10 when he was seen again in Algonquin Park by Callighan. According to Wadland, if this timeline is correct, it would require \\"an extraordinary canoeist ... The difficulty is augmented by the fact of stopping to sketch at intervals along the way.\\" Wadland suggested that Thomson may have travelled by train at some point and by steamship thereafter. Addison and Harwood instead said that Thomson had found much of the inland \\"monotonously flat\\" and the rapids \\"ordinary\\". Wadland found this characterization unhelpful, pointing out that the rapids Thomson had faced were hardly \\"ordinary\\". Cottage on a Rocky Shore, Summer 1914. Sketch. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa MacCallum provided specific dates for two of Thomson's paintings‚ÄîMay 30 and June 1 for Parry Sound Harbour and Spring, French River, respectively. These are some of the only instances of precise dating for his work. Cottage on a Rocky Shore is a depiction of MacCallum's cottage contrasted with the vast expanse of sky and water. Evening, Pine Island is of a nearby island MacCallum took Thomson to visit. He continued to paint around the islands until he departed, probably because he found MacCallum's cottage too demanding socially, writing to Varley that it was \\"too much like north Rosedale\\". Thomson continued canoeing alone until he met with A. Y. Jackson at Canoe Lake in mid-September. Though World War I had erupted that year, he and Jackson went on a canoe trip, in October meeting up with Varley and his wife Maud, as well as Lismer and his wife Esther, and daughter Marjorie. This marked the first time three Group of Seven members painted together, and the only time they worked with Thomson. In his 1958 autobiography, A Painter's Country, A. Y. Jackson wrote that, \\"Had it not been for the war, the Group [of Seven] would have formed several years earlier and it would have included Thomson.\\" Why Thomson did not serve in the war has been debated. Mark Robinson and Thomson's family said that he was turned down after multiple attempts to enlist, likely due to his poor health and age but also possibly because he had flat feet. Blodwen Davies wrote that Thomson's artist friends tried to convince him to not risk his life, but he decided to secretly volunteer anyway., quoted in . Andrew Hunter has found this scenario to be improbable, especially given that other artist friends did volunteer for the war, such as A. Y. Jackson. Thomson's sister suggested that he was a pacifist and that \\"he hated war and said simply in 1914 that he never would kill anyone but would like to help in a hospital, if accepted\\"., quoted in . William Colgate wrote that Thomson \\"brooded much upon\\" the war and that \\"he himself did not enlist. Rumour has it that he tried, and failed to pass the doctor. This is doubtful.\\", quoted in . Edward Godin, a companion, said \\"We had many discussions on the war. As I remember it he did not think that Canada should be involved. He was very outspoken in his opposition to Government patronage. Especially in the Militia. I do not think that we would offer himself for service. I know up until that time he had not tried to enlist.\\" There is only one verifiable example of Thomson's opinion on the war, taken from a letter he wrote to J. E. H. MacDonald in 1915: In Algonquin Park, Winter 1914‚Äì15. 63.2 √ó 81.1 cm. McMichael Canadian Art Collection, Kleinburg With MacCallum's year of financial support over, Thomson's financial future became uncertain. He briefly looked into applying for a position as a park ranger, but balked after seeing that it could take months for the application to go through. Instead, he considered working in an engraving shop over the winter. He made little effort to sell his paintings, preferring to give them away, though he brought in some money from the paintings he sold. In mid-November, he donated In Algonquin Park to an exhibition organized to raise money for the Canadian Patriotic Fund. It was sold to Marion Long for $50 (). In the spring of 1915, Thomson returned to Algonquin Park earlier than he had in any previous year and had already painted twenty-eight sketches by April 22. From April through July, he spent much of his time fishing, assisting groups on several different lakes, and sketching when he had time. In July, he was invited to send paintings to the Nova Scotia Provincial Exhibition in September. Because he was in Algonquin Park, his friends selected three works to send‚Äîtwo unidentified works from 1914 and the sketch Canadian Wildflowers. From the end of September to mid-October, he spent his time at Mowat, a village on the north end of Canoe Lake. By November, he was at Round Lake with Tom Wattie and Dr. Robert McComb., quoted in . In late November, he returned to Toronto and moved into a shack behind the Studio Building that Harris and MacCallum fixed up for him, renting it for $1 a month. In 1915, MacCallum commissioned MacDonald, Lismer and Thomson to paint decorative panels for his cottage on Go-Home Bay. In October of that year, MacDonald went up to take dimensions. Thomson produced four panels which were probably meant to go over the windows. In April 1916, when MacDonald and Lismer went to install them, they found that MacDonald's measurements were incorrect and the panels did not fit.

National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa Artistic peak (1916‚Äì17) In March 1916, Thomson exhibited four canvases with the OSA: In the Northland (at that time titled The Birches), Spring Ice, Moonlight and October (then titled The Hardwoods), all of which were painted over the winter of 1915‚Äì16. Sir Edmund Walker and Eric Brown of the National Gallery of Canada wanted to purchase In the Northland, but Montreal trustee Dr. Francis Shepherd convinced them to purchase Spring Ice instead. The reception of Thomson's paintings at this time was mixed. Margaret Fairbairn of the Toronto Daily Star wrote, \\"Mr. Tom Thomson's 'The Birches' and 'The Hardwoods' show a fondness for intense yellows and orange and strong blue, altogether a fearless use of violent colour which can scarcely be called pleasing, and yet which seems an exaggeration of a truthful feeling that time will temper.\\", quoted in . A more favourable take came from artist Wyly Grier in The Christian Science Monitor: In the Northland, Winter 1915‚Äì1916. 101.7 x 114.5 cm. Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, Montreal In The Canadian Courier, painter Estelle Kerr also spoke positively, describing Thomson as \\"one of the most promising of Canadian painters who follows the impressionist movement and his work reveals himself to be a fine colourist, a clever technician, and a truthful interpreter of the north land in its various aspects\\"., quoted in . In 1916, Thomson left for Algonquin Park earlier than any previous year, evidenced by the many snow studies he produced at this time. In April or early May, MacCallum, Harris and his cousin Chester Harris joined Thomson at Cauchon Lake for a canoe trip. After MacCallum and Chester left, Harris and Thomson paddled together to Aura Lee Lake. Thomson produced many sketches which varied in composition, although they all had vivid colour and thickly-applied paint. MacCallum was present when he painted his Sketch for \\"The Jack Pine\\", writing that the tree fell over onto Thomson before the sketch was completed. He added that Harris thought the tree killed Thomson, \\"but he sprang up and continued painting\\". Tea Lake Dam, Summer 1917. Sketch. McMichael Canadian Art Collection, Kleinburg At the end of May, Thomson took a job as a fire ranger stationed at Achray on Grand Lake with Ed Godin. He followed the Booth Lumber Company's log drive down the Petawawa River to the north end of the park. He found that fire ranging and painting did not mix well together, writing, \\"[I] have done very little sketching this summer as the two jobs don't fit in... When we are travelling two go together, one for canoe and the other the pack. And there's no place for a sketch outfit when your fire ranging. We are not fired yet but I am hoping to get put off right away.\\" He likely returned to Toronto in late October or early November. Over the following winter, encouragement from Harris, MacDonald and MacCallum saw Thomson move into the most productive portion of his career, with Thomson writing in a letter that he \\"got quite a lot done\\". Despite this, he did not submit any paintings to the OSA exhibition in the spring of 1917. It was during this time that he produced many of his most famous works, including The Jack Pine and The West Wind. Dr. MacCallum suggested that several canvas works were unfinished, including Woodland Waterfall, The Pointers and The Drive., quoted in . Barker Fairley similarly described The West Wind as unfinished., quoted in . Charles Hill has written that there are no reasons to believe Woodland Waterfall was unfinished. Similarly, while it has sometimes been suggested that The Drive was modified after Thomson's death,, quoted in . a reproduction from 1918 displays no discernible differences. Thomson returned to Canoe Lake at the beginning of April, arriving early enough to paint the remaining snow and the ice breaking up on the surrounding lakes. He had little money but wrote that he could manage for about a year. On April 28, 1917, he received a guide's licence. Unlike previous years, he remained at Mowat with Lieutenant Crombine and his wife, Daphne. Thomson invited Daphne Crombie to select something from his spring sketches as a gift, and she selected Path Behind Mowat Lodge. Besides the deep love he had come to develop for Algonquin Park, Thomson was beginning to show an eagerness to depict areas beyond the park and explore other northern subjects. In an April 1917 letter to his brother-in-law, he wrote that he was considering taking the Canadian Northern Railway west so he could paint the Canadian Rockies in July and August. A. Y. Jackson suggested Thomson would have traveled even further north, just as the other members of the Group of Seven eventually did. File:Tom Thomson Petawawa Gorges.jpgPetawawa Gorges, Fall 1916.

Thomson Collection, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto =Death= The Tom Thomson Memorial Cairn, Canoe Lake, Algonquin Park On July 8, 1917, Thomson disappeared during a canoeing trip on Canoe Lake. His upturned canoe was spotted later in the afternoon, and his body was discovered in the lake eight days later. It was noted that he had a four-inch cut on his right temple and had bled from his right ear. The cause of death was officially determined to be \\"accidental drowning\\". The day after the body was discovered, it was interred in Mowat Cemetery near Canoe Lake. Under the direction of Thomson's older brother George, the body was exhumed two days later, and re-interred on July 21 in the family plot beside the Leith Presbyterian Church in what is now the Municipality of Meaford, Ontario. In September 1917, J. E. H. MacDonald and John William Beatty erected a memorial cairn at Hayhurst Point on Canoe Lake, to honour Thomson where he died. There has been much speculation about the circumstances of Thomson's death, including that he was murdered or committed suicide. Though these ideas lack substance, they have continued to persist in the popular culture. Andrew Hunter has pointed to Park ranger Mark Robinson as being largely responsible for the suggestion that there was more to his death than accidental drowning. Hunter expands on this thought, writing, \\"I am convinced that people's desire to believe the Thomson murder mystery/soap opera is rooted in the firmly fixed idea that he was an expert woodsman, intimate with nature. Such figures aren't supposed to die by 'accident.' If they do, it is like Grey Owl's being exposed as an Englishman.\\" Art and technique Northern River, Winter 1914‚Äì15. 115.1 √ó 102 cm. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa =Artistic development= Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound. Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts. Northern Lights, Spring 1917. Sketch. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa Thomson's artwork is typically divided into two bodies: the first are the small oil sketches on wood panels, of which there are around 400, and the second is of around 50 larger works on canvas. The smaller sketches were typically done en plein air in \\"the North\\", primarily Algonquin Park, in the spring, summer and fall. Mark Robinson later recounted that Thomson usually had a particular motif he wanted to depict before going into nature to find a comparison., quoted in . The larger canvases were instead completed over the winter in Thomson's studio‚Äîan old utility shack with a wood-burning stove on the grounds of the Studio Building, an artist's enclave in Rosedale, Toronto. About a dozen of the major canvases were derived directly from smaller sketches. Paintings like Northern River, Spring Ice, The Jack Pine and The West Wind were only later expanded into larger oil paintings. Sketches from 1913 and earlier use a variety of supports, including canvas laid down on paperboard, canvas laid down on wood and commercial canvas-board. In 1914, he began to favour the larger birch wood panels used by A. Y. Jackson, typically measuring around 21.6 √ó 26.7 cm (8¬Ω √ó 10¬Ω in.). From late 1914 on, Thomson alternated between painting on these inexpensive pieces of wood‚Äîsome from crates, bookbinder's board, and other assorted sources‚Äîand composite wood-pulp boards. Although the sketches were produced quickly, the canvases were developed over weeks or even months. Compared to the panels, they display an \\"inherent formality\\", and lack much of the \\"energy, spontaneity, and immediacy\\" of the original sketches. The transition from small to large required a reinvention or elaboration of the original details; by comparing sketches with their respective canvases, one can see the changes Thomson made in colour, detail and background textural patterns. Although few of the larger paintings were sold during his lifetime, they formed the basis of posthumous exhibitions, including one at Wembley in London in 1924, that eventually brought his work to international attention. Described as having an \\"idiosyncratic palette\\", Thomson had exceptional control of colour. He often mixed available pigments to create new, unusual colours that, along with his brushwork, made his art instantly recognizable regardless of its subject. His painting style and the atmosphere, colours and forms of his work influenced the work of his colleagues and friends, especially Jackson, Lismer, MacDonald, Harris and Carmichael.: \\"[Thomson's sketches] directly inspired and informed the work of his colleagues, particularly Jackson, Lismer, MacDonald and Lawren Harris...\\" : \\"...Thomson's way of painting strongly influenced Carmichael.\\" =Series and themes= Trees The West Wind, Winter 1916‚Äì17. 120.7 √ó 137.9 cm. Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto Thomson's most famous paintings are his depictions of pine trees, particularly The Jack Pine and The West Wind. David Silcox has described these paintings as \\"the visual equivalent of a national anthem, for they have come to represent the spirit of the whole country, notwithstanding the fact that vast tracts of Canada have no pine trees\\", and as \\"so majestic and memorable that nearly everyone knows them\\". Arthur Lismer described them similarly, saying that the tree in The West Wind was a symbol of the Canadian character, unyielding to the wind and emblematic of steadfastness and resolution., quoted in . Thomson had a great enthusiasm for trees and worked to capture their forms, their surrounding locations, and the effect of the seasons on them. He normally depicted trees as amalgamated masses, giving \\"form structure and colour by dragging paint in bold strokes over an underlying tone\\". His favourite motif was of a slight hill next to a body of water. His enthusiasm is especially apparent in an anecdote from Ernest Freure, who invited Thomson to camp on an island on Georgian Bay: The theme of the single tree is common in Art Nouveau, while the motif of the lone, heroic tree goes back even further to at least Caspar David Friedrich and early German Romanticism. Thomson may also have been influenced by the work of MacDonald while working at Grip Limited. MacDonald in turn was influenced by the landscape art of John Constable, whose work he likely saw while in England from 1903 to 1906. Constable's art influenced Thomson's as well, something apparent when Constable's Stoke-by-Nayland () is compared with Thomson's Poplars by a Lake. Thomson's earlier paintings were closer to literal renderings of the trees in front of him, and as he progressed the trees became more expressive as Thomson amplified their individual qualities. Byng Inlet, Georgian Bay shows the broken, high-keyed colour that Thomson and his colleagues experimented with later in his career, and is similar to Lismer's Sunglow. While Lismer only applied the technique to the water, Thomson applied it throughout the composition. According to MacCallum, Thomson worked on Pine Island, Georgian Bay over an extended period. He wrote that this painting had \\"more emotion and feeling than any other of [Thomson's] canvases\\". In contrast, MacDonald found it \\"rather commonplace in color & composition & not representative of Thomson at his best\\".

National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa Thomson was preoccupied with capturing the sky, especially near the end of his career from 1915 onward. Paintings like Sunset‚Äîwhich was painted at water level in a canoe‚Äîillustrate his excited brushstrokes in capturing the lake's reflection. The painting was done over a grey-green ground, adding depth to both the light of the sky and the reflecting water. Paintings from 1913 and on consistently utilize the perspective of the canoe, with a narrow foreground of water, a distant shoreline and a dominating sky. The 1915 volcanic eruption of Lassen Peak in California provided dramatic sunrises and sunsets in the northern hemisphere for the year. These skies provided artistic inspiration for Thomson and other artists in the same way that the eruption of Krakatoa in the previous century had inspired Edvard Munch. Sky effects were one of Thomson's main interests for the entire year, indicated by his heightened use of colour. Harold Town has compared Sky (The Light That Never Was) to the works of J. M. W. Turner. In particular, he notes the way that the sky \\"[creeps] into the landscape, big rhythms supplanting small movement\\". The horizon disappears and pure movement is left behind.

Sketch. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa Thomson produced more nocturnes than the rest of the Group of Seven combined‚Äîroughly two dozen. MacCallum recalled that Thomson often spent his nights lying in his canoe in the middle of the lake, stargazing and avoiding mosquitoes. Besides capturing the nighttime sky, he also captured silhouettes of spruce and birch trees, lumber camps, two moose emerging from water and the northern lights, painting five different sketches of the aurora. Mark Robinson recounted that Thomson stood and contemplated the aurora for an extended period of time before going back into his cabin to paint by lamplight. He sometimes completed nocturnes this way, going back and forth between painting indoors and looking at the subject outside until he completed the sketch. Other times, given the difficulty of painting by moonlight, many of the nocturnes were painted entirely from memory. MacCallum confirmed that the sketch Moose at Night was completed in this way, writing on the back \\"Winter 1916‚Äîat studio\\", implying it was probably painted in Toronto. His moonlight paintings use a \\"dreamy, pale-toned style\\", applying the techniques of Impressionism in his observations of light, reflection and atmosphere.

McMichael Canadian Art Collection, Kleinburg As was typical for painters of the early twentieth century, Thomson produced still lifes of flowers, all of which appear in the form of sketches. His love of flowers may have developed from his father who, as a neighbour noted, had \\"a permanent half acre of a really good garden which was always worth going to see\\". Thomson's time spent as a child collecting samples with his naturalist relative Dr. William Brodie may have similarly influenced him, though his interest in painting flowers seems to have been more focused on patterning and decoration than on the horticultural specifics of the subject. These paintings, especially Marguerites, Wood Lilies and Vetch and Wildflowers, are particularly powerful examples of the genre. J. E. H. MacDonald‚Äîhimself deeply invested in floral imagery‚Äîwas so captured by Marguerites, Wood Lilies and Vetch that he kept it for himself, writing \\"Not For Sale\\" on the back. Thomson's work is contrasted from MacDonald's by what Joan Murray calls, \\"its elegant, slightly funky form and throwaway spontaneity.\\" Lawren Harris instead noted Wildflowers as a favourite, writing \\"1st class\\" on the verso. The colour of the sketch is less brilliant, but has superb brushwork and is well coordinated, setting blues against yellows and reds against whites. Responding to his subject with improvisation, every painting is different in its colour scheme and arrangement. In all the sketches, he redirected emphasis from the delicacy of the flowers towards simple broad strokes of colour, something Harold Town thought \\"[imparted] a toughness of design sometimes missing in his harder themes of rock and bracken\\". In Water Flowers particularly, the shapes are handled so summarily that the focus moves entirely to the colour of the flowers. This, combined with the black background, produces a more abstract effect. The black backdrop also causes the colours of the flowers to appear more vivid.

Sketch. National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa During Thomson's time in Algonquin Park, logging and the lumber industry were a constant presence. He often painted the machinery left behind by lumber companies; Lismer, MacDonald and he were especially drawn to the subject. A. Y. Jackson wrote, Around 1916, Thomson followed the drive of logs down the Madawaska River, painting the subject in The Drive. MacDonald similarly expressed the drive in his 1915 painting Logs on the Gatineau. Besides the dams, pointer and alligator boats and log drives that appear in Thomson's work, other less obvious depictions of the lumber industry are evident. For example, areas cleared out due to logging appear in early sketches, such as Canoe Lake (1913) and Red Forest. The painting Drowned Land similarly displays the damage caused by logging operations and flooding due to damming. As well, the white birches present in many paintings only thrive in \\"sunny, open areas whose previous tree cover had been removed\\",, quoted in . meaning that logging was in some way necessary for them to flourish. Thomson's and the Group of Seven's work reflects the typical Canadian attitudes of the time, namely that the available natural resources were meant to be exploited. Harold Town has argued that, while Thomson was not directly critical of industry, mining and logging, he \\"did not glorify industry in the bush.\\" File:Thomson, Drowned Land.jpgDrowned Land, Fall 1912.

University of Guelph Collection, Art Gallery of Guelph, Guelph People The Poacher, Spring 1916. Sketch. Thomson Collection, Art Gallery of Ontario, Toronto Thomson, like most of the members of the Group of Seven, rarely painted people. When he did, the human subject was usually someone close to him personally, such as the depiction of Shannon Fraser In the Sugar Bush. Harold Town observed that both Thomson and Canadian artist David Milne \\"shared in common a similar inability to draw the human figure\\", something professor John Wadland thought was \\"embarrassingly evident\\" in several of Thomson's portraits. Thomson's most successful attempts at capturing people typically feature figures far off in the distance, allowing them to blend in to the scene. This is apparent in paintings like Little Cauchon Lake, Bateaux, The Drive, The Pointers and Tea Lake Dam. Town described paintings like Man with Axe (Lowery Dixon) Splitting Wood as stiff, yet still held together in a cohesive crudity. He described Figure of a Lady, Laura differently, interpreting it as a tender work, \\"well-designed and plainly expressed, this loving picture is so secure in intention that it survives, indeed triumphs, over the severe cracking of the paint\\". The figure in The Poacher is recorded deliberately, including his hat, hunting vest and blue shirt. The hot coal grill in front of him is drying his poach‚Äîlikely venison.

Art Gallery of Alberta, Edmonton Legacy and influence Thomson fishing at Tea Lake Dam in Algonquin Park, Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\"., quoted in . Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" Murray notes that Thomson's influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Rae Johnson, Joyce Wieland, Gordon Rayner and Michael Snow., quoted in Sherrill Grace wrote that for Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he \\"is a haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\". As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD$2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market. In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute. =The outdoorsman= Though best known for his painting, Thomson is often mythologized as a veritable outdoorsman. Dr. James MacCallum contributed stories to this image. He has often been remembered as an expert canoeist, though David Silcox has argued that this image is romanticized. In the case of fishing, he was no doubt proficient. He had a deep love of fishing for his entire life, so much so that his reputation through Algonquin Park was equally divided between art and angling. Most who visited the Park were led by hired guides, but he moved through on his own. Many of his fishing locations appear in his work.

It was included with every Macintosh personal computer from 2002 to 2015, when it was replaced with Apple's Photos application. Originally sold as part of the iLife suite of digital media management applications, iPhoto was able to import, organize, edit, print and share digital photos. History iPhoto was announced at Macworld 2002, during which Steve Jobs (then-CEO of Apple) also announced that macOS would be installed standard on new Macs from then on, and revealed new iMac and iBook models. On March 7, 2012, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced an iOS-native version of iPhoto alongside the third- generation iPad. On June 27, 2014, Apple announced that they would cease development of iPhoto and work on a transition to their new Photos app. On February 5, 2015 Apple included a preview of Photos with a 10.10.3 beta. On April 8, 2015, Apple released OS X Yosemite 10.10.3, which includes the new Photos app. iPhoto and Aperture were discontinued and removed from the Mac App Store. With the release of macOS Catalina 10.15 on October 7, 2019, iPhoto became unusable. Features =macOS version= iPhoto was designed to allow the importing of pictures from digital cameras, local storage devices such as USB flash drive, CDs, DVDs and hardrives to a user's iPhoto Library. Almost all digital cameras were recognized without additional software. iPhoto supported most common image file formats, including several Raw image formats. iPhoto also supported videos from cameras, but editing was limited to trimming clips. After photos were imported, they could be titled, labeled, sorted and organized into groups (known as \\"events\\"). Individual photos could be edited with basic image manipulation tools, such as a red-eye filter, contrast and brightness adjustments, cropping and resizing tools, and other basic functions. iPhoto did not, however, provide the comprehensive editing functionality of programs such as Apple's own Aperture, or Adobe's Photoshop (not to be confused with Photoshop Elements or Album), or GIMP. iPhoto offered numerous options for sharing photos. Photo albums could be made into dynamic slideshows and optionally set to music imported from iTunes. Photos could be shared via iMessage, Mail, Facebook, Flickr and Twitter. Creating and sharing iCloud Photostreams are possible as well, both public and invitation based ones. iPhoto was also able to sync photo albums to any iPod with a color display. These iPods might also have an audio/video output to allow photos to be played back, along with music, on any modern television. Additionally, photos could be printed to a local printer, or, in certain markets, be sent over the internet to Kodak for professional printing. iPhoto users could order a range of products, including standard prints, posters, cards, calendars, and 100-page hardcover or softcover volumes‚Äîagain, such services were available only to users in certain markets. =iOS version= At an Apple media event on March 7, 2012, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced a new version of iPhoto for use on the iOS mobile operating system. iPhoto for iOS was made available that day on the App Store for 4.99 alongside the already-released iMovie and GarageBand for iOS. It was officially supported on the iPhone 4 and later, iPod Touch (4th and 5th generations), iPad 2 and later and iPad Mini (1st and 2nd generations), but hackers discovered that it could be installed manually on older devices using Apple's iPhone Configuration Utility.iPhone Configuration Utility. iPhoto for iOS offered a feature set fairly comparable to that of its Mac counterpart. It could organize photos that were synced to the device or taken with its camera. Editing features included color correction tools and photo effects, as well as cropping and straightening tools. iPhoto for iOS lacked tools for creating books, calendars, cards and ordering prints, though it could create \\"Photo Journals\\"‚Äîdigital photo collages that could be uploaded to Apple's iCloud service and shared. iPhoto for iOS was highly praised for its professional tools, good performance and compatibility. iPhoto for iOS was discontinued in 2014 and removed from the App Store in favor of Photos.

She has been a professor, researcher and/or lecturer at multiple universities, and she is currently a research associate and lecturer at Harvard University. Pepperberg also serves on the Advisory Council of METI (Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence). She is well known for her comparative studies into the cognitive fundamentals of language and communication, and she was one of the first to work on language learning in animals other than human species (exemplified by the Washoe project), by extension to a bird species. Pepperberg is also active in wildlife conservation, especially in relation to parrots. Early life, family and education Born in 1949 as Irene Platzblatt in Brooklyn, New York City, New York, she was an only child. Her father, Robert Platzblatt, was a biochemist and middle school teacher. Her parents were both first-generation American Jews. Her mother's parents were from Romania, and her father's from Lithuania. In the 1950s, the family resided in Brooklyn in an apartment above a store, and beginning at a very young age, Irene would own and train a series of budgies. She earned her bachelor's degree in Chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1969, and brought one of her budgies there with her. She subsequently earned a master's degree in Chemistry in 1971 at Harvard University, followed by a doctorate in Chemical Physics in 1976 at Harvard. During her doctoral program, she saw an episode of the PBS TV series Nova about animals and language, which influenced her to focus on that instead of chemistry. Work history Pepperberg has been a researcher, lecturer and adjunct or visiting professor at multiple universities. She was a research associate and lecturer at Purdue University (1979‚Äì1984) and Harvard University (in the 1970s and since 2005). At the MIT Media Lab, she has been a visiting associate professor (1999‚Äì2000) and researcher (2001‚Äì02). While at Purdue, she was involved in the biological sciences and psychological sciences departments. At University of Arizona, she was an associate professor in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology with joint appointment in the psychology department and in the neuroscience program (1991‚Äì2000). She has been a Bunting Fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study (2004‚Äì2005) and an adjunct associate professor at Brandeis University (2002‚Äì2013), where its bird laboratory was named for her.  Research work  Although parrots have long been known for their capacities in vocal mimicry, Pepperberg set out to show that their vocal behavior could have the characteristics of human language. She worked intensively with a single grey parrot, Alex, and reported that he acquired a large vocabulary and used it in a sophisticated way, which is often described as similar to that of a five-year-old child. Pepperberg and her colleagues have sought to show that Alex can differentiate meaning and syntax, so that his use of vocal communication is unlike the relatively inflexible forms of \\"instinctive\\" communication that are widespread in the animal kingdom. Although such results are always likely to be controversial, and working intensively with a single animal always incurs the risk of Clever Hans effects, Pepperberg's work has strengthened the argument that humans do not hold the monopoly on the complex or semicomplex use of abstract communication. Some researchers believe that the training method that Pepperberg used with Alex, (called the model/rival technique) holds promise for teaching autistic and other learning-disabled children who have difficulty learning language and communication skills, numerical concepts and empathy. When some autistic children were taught using the same methods Pepperberg devised to teach parrots, their response exceeded expectations. From work with the single subject Alex, Pepperberg and her colleagues have gone on to study additional grey parrots, and also parrots of other species. Other notable parrot subjects of her research have been Griffin and Arthur. Alex was found dead on the morning of September 6, 2007, and was seemingly healthy the previous day. On September 10, 2007, Alex's necropsy revealed no discernible cause of death.  Model/rival technique  The model/rival technique involves two trainers, one to give instructions, and one to model correct and incorrect responses and to act as the student's rival for the trainer's attention; the model and trainer also exchange roles so that the student sees that the process is fully interactive. The parrot, in the role of student, tries to reproduce the correct behavior. The use of this model/rival technique resulted in Alex identifying objects by color, shape, number and material at about the level of chimpanzees and dolphins. His language abilities were equivalent to those of a 2-year-old child and he had the problem solving skills of a 5-year-old. Alex was learning the alphabet, had a vocabulary of 150 words, knew the names of 50 objects and could count up to eight when he died. He could also answer questions about objects. Pepperberg countered critics' claims that Alex had been taught a script by explaining that the controls and tests she used made it impossible for him simply to recite words when she asked questions. The Clever Hans effect did not apply, she argued, as Alex would talk to anyone, not just to her. Building on Pepperberg's research, cognitive scientist Michael Trestman has argued that scaffolding and modeling, both approaches that the model/rival technique utilizes, can account for the cognitive evolution in humans, including \\"language, advanced social cognition, and elaborate forms of tool craft.\\" The Alex Foundation Pepperberg is president of The Alex Foundation, a not- for-profit 501(c)(3) organization,The Alex Foundation Inc., Nonprofit Organization Lookup, Melissa DATA Corp. Retrieved September 1, 2009. which she started. The foundation supports Pepperberg and her team's research. In a 2006 interview, Pepperberg said that the foundation was her only funding source, having lost her paid research position due to a funding crunch at MIT's Media Lab,\\"Friday Grey Matters: Irene Pepperberg Interview!\\" , by Shelley Batts, December 8, 2006, ScienceBlogs. Retrieved September 1, 2009. although the report of that interview does not mention her research associate position at Harvard University since 2005. The Alex Foundation raises money through donations, from direct sale of parrot-related gifts, and indirectly from sales through sponsoring businesses. AI research Some researchers have suggested that studying avian cognition might allow a useful artificial intelligence to be built without requiring as much resources, as for some applications a parrot or corvid level complexity brain would be adequate such as for image sorting. In recent years it was found that pigeons could sort CT scan data as well as microscope slides with equal or better accuracy than a human expert with only weeks of behavioral training needed.  Personal life  Pepperberg was married for more than twenty years to David Pepperberg, a neuroscientist. However, they divorced.

V7, released in 1979, was the last Bell Laboratories release to see widespread distribution before the commercialization of Unix by AT&T; Corporation in the early 1980s. V7 was originally developed for Digital Equipment Corporation's PDP-11 minicomputers and was later ported to other platforms. Overview Unix versions from Bell Labs were designated by the edition of the user's manual with which they were accompanied. Released in 1979, the Seventh Edition was preceded by Sixth Edition, which was the first version licensed to commercial users. Development of the Research Unix line continued with the Eighth Edition, which incorporated development from 4.1BSD, through the Tenth Edition, after which the Bell Labs researchers concentrated on developing Plan 9. V7 was the first readily portable version of Unix. As this was the era of minicomputers, with their many architectural variations, and also the beginning of the market for 16-bit microprocessors, many ports were completed within the first few years of its release. The first Sun workstations (then based on the Motorola 68000) ran a V7 port by UniSoft; the first version of Xenix for the Intel 8086 was derived from V7 and Onyx Systems soon produced a Zilog Z8000 computer running V7. The VAX port of V7, called UNIX/32V, was the direct ancestor of the popular 4BSD family of Unix systems. The group at University of Wollongong that had ported V6 to the Interdata 7/32 ported V7 to that machine as well. Interdata sold the port as Edition VII, making it the first commercial UNIX offering. DEC distributed their own PDP-11 version of V7, called V7M (for modified). V7M, developed by DEC's original Unix Engineering Group (UEG), contained many enhancements to the kernel for the PDP-11 line of computers including significantly improved hardware error recovery and many additional device drivers. UEG evolved into the group that later developed Ultrix. Reception Due to its power yet elegant simplicity, many old-time Unix users remember V7 as the pinnacle of Unix development and have dubbed it \\"the last true Unix\\", an improvement over all preceding and following Unices. At the time of its release, though, its greatly extended feature set came at the expense of a decrease in performance compared to V6, which was to be corrected largely by the user community. The number of system calls in Version 7 was only around 50, while later Unix and Unix-like systems continued to add many more:Stevens, W Richard. Rago, Stephen A.

In 2002, Caldera International releasedCaldera releases original unices under BSD license on slashdot.org (2002) V7 as FOSS under a permissive BSD-like software license.

The government is a restoration of the Galactic Republic, a democratic state that governed the galaxy for a thousand years until being reorganized into the Galactic Empire by Palpatine. It is first portrayed onscreen in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), where it is depicted as the ruling government of the galaxy and primary target of the First Order, a military power that seeks to restore the Galactic Empire. It was destroyed 30 years after Return of the Jedi (1983) by the First Order and its Starkiller Base when Hosnian Prime was destroyed. The New Republic debuted in the 1991 Star Wars Legends novel, Heir to the Empire, by author Timothy Zahn. Depiction =Origins= A year after its decisive victory at the Battle of Endor as depicted in Return of the Jedi (1983), the Rebel Alliance reorganized itself into the New Republic. The goal of the New Republic was to restore the democratic rule of the galaxy that had existed under its predecessor state, the Old Republic. The Republic pressed its advantage against the Empire by pursuing shattered imperial forces across the galaxy. The Republic placed its first capital on the planet Chandrila, but later would decide to rotate its capital among the Republic's many member planets in order to symbolically differentiate itself from the Old Republic, rather than being seated on the planet Coruscant, the capital planet of the Old Republic and later the Galactic Empire. The restored Senate oversees the stripping of strong executive powers from the chancellor and heavy demilitarization after a peace treaty is signed with the Empire after the Battle of Jakku that effectively reduces it to a rump state in the Outer Rim of the Galaxy. =The Force Awakens (2015)= As depicted in the film, Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015), as well as surrounding published material, which takes place approximately three decades after the events of Return of the Jedi (1983), the New Republic has defeated the Galactic Empire and placed itself as the ruling government of the galaxy. Despite this, thousands of Imperial loyalists, bureaucrats, and military officers retreated into the unexplored regions of the galaxy in hopes of rebuilding the Old Empire, as it was being called, and restoring Imperial rule to the galaxy. These individuals were able to form the First Order, an offshoot of the Empire seeking to destroy the Republic and rule the galaxy. For the three decades preceding the film, the First Order operated secretly in the unexplored regions, rebuilding its army and starfleet, in hopes of resurrecting the Empire. Inspired by the ideology of the Old Empire, the First Order constructed Starkiller Base, which hosted a massive superweapon that was capable of destroying entire star systems at once. The superweapon was built into a mobile planet from the unexplored regions of the galaxy, and would travel across multiple star systems to draw their sun's energy in order to charge its weapon. In The Force Awakens (2015), the First Order's General Hux, who commands Starkiller Base, has its superweapon fire on the Hosnian system, which includes Courtsilius, Raysho, Hosnian, Cardota, and Hosnian Prime, the capital planet of the Republic at the time. The weapon is successful, and destroys a portion of the Republic's defense fleet and Senate, the ruling legislative body of the Republic, as well as the system itself, killing billions of citizens. However, Starkiller Base is later destroyed by the Resistance, a splinter of the Republic's military and protagonists of the film, during a battle shortly after the destruction of the Hosnian system. =The Last Jedi (2017)= It is revealed in the sequel Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017) that the New Republic was disbanded after the destruction of the Senate. The First Order, under the leadership of Supreme Leader Snoke, begins seizing military control of the galaxy as Republic systems either choose to capitulate to the reigning First Order or resist their conquest. Vice Admiral Holdo asserts to the Resistance that their mission is to survive and restore the Republic, thereby suggesting that it has collapsed entirely as the Resistance begins to be referred to as rebels. However, the novelization of The Last Jedi states that some Republic commanders survived the Hosnian Cataclysm and have returned to their homeworlds. Leia sends Resistance agents to those worlds to galvanize support. =The Rise of Skywalker (2019)= In the wake of the Battle of Exegol as depicted in the second and last sequel Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker (2019), the entire galaxy rises up against the First Order, ultimately defeating it after 30 years of its existence. It is unknown whether or not the New Republic will be reformed or transition to a new democratic government remains to be seen, while in the novelization of The Rise of Skywalker it is guessed to be called the New New Republic by Rebel war hero and veteran Lando Calrissian. =Legends= Following the Alliance to Restore the Republic's victory at the Battle of Endor, which is depicted in Return of the Jedi, the Rebel Alliance temporarily reorganizes into the Alliance of Free Planets. The new Alliance serves as a provisional government which eventually transitions into the New Republic. Later, the New Republic is threatened by the Dark Empire in the 3-part graphic novel of the same name. Later, in the process of the Yuuzhan Vong Invasion, the New Republic is destroyed. Later, at the end of The New Jedi Order, the New Republic is reborn as the Galactic Federation of Free Alliances (Galactic Alliance). After Disney's acquisition of the franchise, the Expanded Universe was rebranded as Legends and declared non-canon.

In philosophy of science, typical examples of \\"unobservables\\" are the force of gravity, causation and beliefs or desires.Fodor, J. A., Psychosemantics: The Problem of Meaning in the Philosophy of Mind (Cambridge, MA / London: MIT Press, 1989), p. 7.  Kant on noumena  The distinction between \\"observable\\" and \\"unobservable\\" is similar to Immanuel Kant's distinction between noumena and phenomena. Noumena are the things-in-themselves, i.e., raw things in their necessarily unknowable state,Stephen Palmquist, \\"The Radical Unknowability of Kant's 'Thing in Itself'\\", Cogito 3:2 (March 1985), pp.101-115; reprinted as Appendix V of Kant's System of Perspectives (University Press of America, 1993). before they pass through the formalizing apparatus of the senses and the mind in order to become perceived objects, which he refers to as \\"phenomena\\". According to Kant, humans can never know noumena; all that humans know is the phenomena.  Locke on primary and secondary qualities  Kant's distinction is similar to John Locke's distinction between primary and secondary qualities. Secondary qualities are what humans perceive such as redness, chirping, heat, mustiness or sweetness. Primary qualities would be the actual qualities of the things themselves which give rise to the secondary qualities which humans perceive.  Philosophy of science  The ontological nature and epistemological issues concerning unobservables is a central topic in philosophy of science. The notion that a given unobservable exists is referred to as scientific realism, in contrast to instrumentalism, the notion that unobservables such as atoms are useful models but don't necessarily exist. The notion of observability plays a central role in constructive empiricism. According to van Fraassen, the goal of scientific theories is not truth about all entities but only truth about all observable entities. If a theory is true in this restricted sense, it is called an empirically adequate theory. Van Fraassen characterizes observability counterfactually: \\"X is observable if there are circumstances which are such that, if X is present to us under those circumstances, then we observe it\\". A problem with this and similar characterizations is to determine the exact extension of what is unobservable. There is little controversy that regular everyday-objects that we can perceive without any aids are observable. Such objects include e.g. trees, chairs or dogs. But controversy starts with cases where unaided perception fails. This includes cases like using telescopes to study distant galaxies , using microscopes to study bacteria or using cloud chambers to study positrons. Some philosophers have been motivated by these and similar examples to question the value of the distinction between observable and unobservable in general.  Kinds of unobservables  W. V. Metcalf distinguishes three kinds of unobservables. One is the logically unobservable, which involves a contradiction. An example would be a length which is both longer and shorter than a given length. The second is the practically unobservable, that which we can conceive of as observable by the known sense- faculties of man but we are prevented from observing by practical difficulties. The third kind is the physically unobservable, that which can never be observed by any existing sense-faculties of man.

Pixies are considered to be particularly concentrated in the high moorland areas around DevonR. Totnea: \\"Pixies\\", Once a Week, 25 May 1867, page 608, notes the prevalence of belief in Pixies in Devon. and Cornwall,\\"The Folk-Lore of Devon\\", Fraser's Magazine, December 1875, page 773ff. suggesting some Celtic origin for the belief and name. Akin to the Irish and Scottish Aos S√≠, pixies are believed to inhabit ancient underground ancestor sites such as stone circles, barrows, dolmens, ringforts or menhirs.Imagined Landscapes:Archaeology, Perception and Folklore in the Study of Medieval Devon, Lucy Franklin , 2006. In traditional regional lore, pixies are generally benign, mischievous, short of stature and attractively childlike; they are fond of dancing and gather outdoors in huge numbers to dance or sometimes wrestle, through the night, demonstrating parallels with the Cornish plen-an-gwary and Breton Fest Noz (Cornish: troyl) folk celebrations originating in the medieval period. In modern era, they are usually depicted with pointed ears, and often wearing a green outfit and pointed hat although traditional stories describe them wearing dirty ragged bundles of rags which they happily discard for gifts of new clothes.English forests and forest trees, historical, legendary, and descriptive, Ingram, Cooke, and co., 1853. Sometimes their eyes are described as being pointed upwards at the temple ends. These, however, are Victorian era conventions and not part of the older mythology.  Etymology and origin  The origin of the word pixie is uncertain. Some have speculated that it comes from the Swedish dialectal pyske meaning small fairy. Others have disputed this, given there is no plausible case for Nordic dialectal survivals in southwest Britain, claiming instead - in view of the Cornish origin of the piskie - that the term is more probably Celtic in origin, though no clear ancestor of the word is known. The term Pobel Vean ('Little People') is often used to refer to them collectively.Online Etymology Dictionary.Traditional Cornish Stories and Rhymes, 1992 edition, Lodenek Press Very similar analogues exist in closely related Irish (Aos S√≠), Manx (Mooinjer veggey) Welsh Tylwyth Teg ('Fair Family'), and Breton (korrigan) culture, although their common names are unrelated, even within areas of language survival there is a very high degree of local variation of names. In west Penwith, the area of late survival of the Cornish language, spriggans are distinguished from pixies by their malevolent nature. Closely associated with tin mining in Cornwall are the subterranean ancestral knockers. Pixie mythology is believed to pre-date Christian presence in Britain. In the Christian era they were sometimes said to be the souls of children who had died un-baptised. These children would change their appearance to pixies once their clothing was placed in clay funeral pots used in their earthly lives as toys. By 1869 some were suggesting that the name pixie was a racial remnant of Pictic tribes who used to paint and tattoo their skin blue, an attribute often given to pixies. Indeed, the Picts gave their name to a type of Irish Pixie called a Pecht.Irish Fairies by Bob Curran, Apletree 2007 This suggestion is still met in contemporary writing, but there is no proven connection and the etymological connection is doubtful.\\"South Coast Sunterings in England\\", in: Harpers New Monthly Magazine, (1869) pp. 29‚Äì41. Some 19th-century researchers made more general claims about pixie origins, or have connected them with the Puck (Cornish Bucca), a mythological creature sometimes described as a fairy; the name Puck is also of uncertain origin, Irish P√∫ca, Welsh Pwca. The earliest published version of The Three Little Pigs story is from Dartmoor in 1853 and has three little pixies in place of the pigs.English Forests and Forest Trees: Historical, Legendary, and Descriptive (London: Ingram, Cooke, and Company, 1853), pp. 189-90 In older Westcountry dialect modern Received Pronunciation letter pairs are sometimes transposed from the older Saxon spelling (waps for wasp, aks for ask and so on) resulting in piskies in place of modern piksies (pixies) as still commonly found in Devon and Cornwall to modern times. Until the advent of more modern fiction, pixie mythology was localised to Britain. Some have noted similarities to \\"northern fairies\\", Germanic and Scandinavian elves,e.g. John Thackray Bunce: Fairy Tales: Their Origin and Meaning 1878, page 133. or Tomte but pixies are distinguished from them by the myths and stories of Devon and Cornwall. = Cornwall and Devon = Before the mid-19th century, pixies and fairies were taken seriously in much of Cornwall and Devon. Books devoted to the homely beliefs of the peasantry are filled with incidents of pixie manifestations. Some locales are named for the pixies associated with them. In Devon, near Challacombe, a group of rocks are named after the pixies said to dwell there. At Trevose Head in Cornwall, 600 pixies were said to have gathered dancing and laughing in a circle that had appeared upon the turf until one of their number, named Omfra, lost his laugh. After searching amongst the barrows of the ancient kings of Cornwall on St Breock Downs, he wades through the bottomless Dozmary Pool on Bodmin Moor until his laugh is restored by King Arthur in the form of a Chough.traditional Cornish Stories and Rhymes, 1992 edition, Lodenek Press In some areas belief in pixies and fairies as real beings persists. In the legends associated with Dartmoor, pixies (or piskeys) are said to disguise themselves as a bundle of rags to lure children into their play. The pixies of Dartmoor are fond of music and dancing and for riding on Dartmoor colts. These pixies are generally said to be helpful to normal humans, sometimes helping needy widows and others with housework. They are not completely benign however, as they have a reputation for misleading travellers (being \\"pixy-led\\", the remedy for which is to turn your coat inside out).William Crossing, Tales of the Dartmoor Pixies, 1890, page 6. The queen of the Cornish pixies is said to be Joan the Wad (torch), and she is considered to be good luck or bring good luck. In Devon, pixies are said to be \\"invisibly small, and harmless or friendly to man.\\" In some of the legends and historical accounts they are presented as having near-human stature. For instance, a member of the Elford family in Tavistock, Devon, successfully hid from Cromwell's troops in a pixie house.A Handbook for Travellers in Devon, 1887 edition, page 230. Though the entrance has narrowed with time, the pixie house, a natural cavern on Sheep Tor, is still accessible. At Buckland St. Mary, Somerset, pixies and fairies are said to have battled each other. Here the pixies were victorious and still visit the area, whilst the fairies are said to have left after their loss.Katherine Mary Briggs: The Fairies in Tradition and Literature, page 179. By the early 19th century their contact with humans had diminished. In Samuel Drew‚Äôs 1824 book CornwallThe History of Cornwall From the Earliest Records & Traditions, to the Present Time, 2 vols. 1824. one finds the observation: \\"The age of pixies, like that of chivalry, is gone. There is, perhaps, at present hardly a house they are reputed to visit. Even the fields and lanes which they formerly frequented seem to be nearly forsaken. Their music is rarely heard.\\"  Pixie Day  Pixie Day is an old tradition which takes place annually in the East Devon town of Ottery St. Mary in June. The day commemorates a legend of pixies being banished from the town to local caves known as the \\"Pixie's Parlour\\". The Pixie Day legend originates from the early days of Christianity, when a local bishop decided to build a church in Otteri (Ottery St. Mary), and commissioned a set of bells to come from Wales, and to be escorted by monks on their journey. On hearing of this, the pixies were worried, as they knew that once the bells were installed it would be the death knell of their rule over the land. So they cast a spell over the monks to redirect them from the road to Otteri to the road leading them to the cliff's edge at Sidmouth. Just as the monks were about to fall over the cliff, one of the monks stubbed his toe on a rock and said \\"God bless my soul\\" and the spell was broken. The bells were then brought to Otteri and installed. However, the pixies' spell was not completely broken; each year on a day in June the \\"pixies\\" come out and capture the town's bell ringers and imprison them in Pixies' Parlour to be rescued by the Vicar of Ottery St. Mary. This legend is re-enacted each year by the Cub and Brownie groups of Ottery St. Mary, with a specially constructed Pixies' Parlour in the Town Square (the original Pixie's Parlour can be found along the banks of the River Otter).  Characteristics  John Bauer's illustration of Alfred Smedberg's The seven wishes in Among pixies and trolls, an anthology of children's stories John Bauer's illustration for The Changeling by Helena Nyblom in the anthology Among Pixies and Trolls, 1913, K√§lla Pixies are variously described in folklore and fiction. They are often described as ill-clothed or naked.Robert Hunt: Popular Romances of the West of England, 1881, page 96. In 1890, William Crossing noted a pixie's preference for bits of finery: \\"Indeed, a sort of weakness for finery exists among them, and a piece of ribbon appears to be... highly prized by them.\\"William Crossing: Tales of the Dartmoor Pixies, 1890, page 5. Some pixies are said to steal children or to lead travellers astray. This seems to be a cross-over from fairy mythology and not originally attached to pixies; in 1850, Thomas Keightley observed that much of Devon pixie mythology may have originated from fairy myth.The Fairy Mythology, 1850, page 299. Pixies are said to reward consideration and punish neglect on the part of larger humans, for which Keightley gives examples. By their presence they bring blessings to those who are fond of them. Pixies are drawn to horses, riding them for pleasure and making tangled ringlets in the manes of those horses they ride. They are \\"great explorers familiar with the caves of the ocean, the hidden sources of the streams and the recesses of the land.\\"Devon Pixies, Once A Week, 23 February 1867, pages 204‚Äì5. Some find pixies to have a human origin or to \\"partake of human nature\\", in distinction to fairies whose mythology is traced to immaterial and malignant spirit forces. In some discussions pixies are presented as wingless, pygmy-like creatures, however this is probably a later accretion to the mythology. One British scholar stated his belief that \\"Pixies were evidently a smaller race, and, from the greater obscurity of the ... tales about them, I believe them to have been an earlier race.\\"C. Spence Bate: \\"Grimspound and Its Associated Relics\\", Annual Report of the Transactions of the Plymouth Institution, Vol. 5. part 1, 1873‚Äì4, page 46. = Literary interpretations = Many Victorian-era poets saw them as magical beings. An example is Samuel Minturn Peck; in his poem The Pixies he writes:Ballads and Rondeaus, 1881, page 47. :‚ÄòTis said their forms are tiny, yet ::All human ills they can subdue, :Or with a wand or amulet ::Can win a maiden‚Äôs heart for you; :And many a blessing know to stew ::To make to wedlock bright; :Give honour to the dainty crew, ::The Pixies are abroad tonight. The late 19th-century English poet Nora Chesson summarised pixie mythology fairly well in a poem entitled The Pixies.Nora Chesson: Aquamarines, London, 1902, page 81. She gathered all the speculations and myths into verse: { ! Have e‚Äôer you seen the Pixies, the fold not blest or banned? They walk upon the waters; they sail upon the land, They make the green grass greener where‚Äôer their footsteps fall, The wildest hind in the forest comes at their call. They steal from bolted linneys, they milk the key at grass, The maids are kissed a-milking, and no one hears them pass. They flit from byre to stable and ride unbroken foals, They seek out human lovers to win them souls. ! The Pixies know no sorrow, the Pixies feel no fear, They take no care for harvest or seedtime of the year; Age lays no finger on them, the reaper time goes by The Pixies, they who change not, nor grow old or die. The Pixies though they love us, behold us pass away, And are not sad for flowers they gathered yesterday, To-day has crimson foxglove. If purple hose-in-hose withered last night To-morrow will have its rose. } She touches on all the essentials, including even more modern accretions. Pixies are \\"in-between\\", not cursed by God or especially blessed. They do the unexpected, they bless the land, and are forest creatures whom other wild creatures find alluring and non-threatening. They love humans, taking some for mates, and are nearly ageless. They are winged, flitting from place to place. The Pixie Day tradition in Samuel Taylor Coleridge‚Äôs hometown of Ottery St Mary in East Devon was the inspiration for his poem Song of the Pixies.Shed (editor): Complete Works of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Vol. 7, 1854, page 24. The Victorian-era writer Mary Elizabeth Whitcombe divided pixies into tribes according to personality and deeds.Bygone Days of Devon and Cornwall, 1874, page 45. The novelist Anna Eliza Bray suggested that pixies and fairies were distinct species.Legends, Superstitions and Sketches of Devonshire, 1844, page 169.

Though mentioned briefly in the first Star Wars film (A New Hope, 1977), the war itself was not depicted until Attack of the Clones (2002) and Revenge of the Sith (2005). The Clone Wars are also the setting for three eponymous projects: a 2D animated series (2003‚Äì2005), a CGI film (2008), and a 3D CGI series (2008‚Äì2014, 2020). They have featured in numerous Star Wars books and games. Within the Star Wars narrative, the Clone Wars involve a three-year war fought to prevent thousands of planetary systems from seceding from the Galactic Republic and forming the \\"Confederacy of Independent Systems\\", often referred to as \\"the Separatists\\". The Republic uses an army of clone troopers, the namesake of the conflict, led by the Jedi Order against the Separatist battle droid army. The conflict was manufactured as a scheme for the Republic's Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, secretly an evil Sith lord, to gain power and ultimately to convert the democratic Galactic Republic into the autocratic Galactic Empire, which was controlled through means of a military‚Äìindustrial complex and featured in the original trilogy. Lucas used the Clone Wars narrative to answer questions about the original trilogy, such as how the Empire originated and how Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader. The political and military events of the Clone Wars draw inspiration from real- world conflicts and historical events, such as World War II and the American Civil War.  Concept and development  The first reference to the Clone Wars is in Star Wars creator George Lucas' third draft of the first film, which mentions the grizzled cyborg General Kenobi's \\"diary of the Clone Wars\\". The wars were mentioned twice briefly in the final version of the film, referring to Obi-Wan Kenobi as a general who served Leia Organa's father during the conflict. In drafting The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Lucas considered introducing a clone character who had been involved with the Clone Wars. Leigh Brackett's first draft of the film initially developed Lando Calrissian as a clone from a planet of clones involved in the Clone Wars mentioned in A New Hope and were nearly made extinct by the war. Boba Fett was also considered as from a group of shocktroopers nearly wiped out by Jedi during the Clone Wars. However, these concepts were not included in the final version of the film. Lucas was more guarded about the details of the Clone Wars than any other element of Star Wars, even making them off-limits to licensed products and books. Lucas has noted that Palpatine's rise to power is similar to that of Adolf Hitler in Nazi Germany; as Chancellor of Germany, the latter was granted \\"emergency powers\\", as is Palpatine.Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith DVD commentary featuring George Lucas, Rick McCallum, Rob Coleman, John Knoll and Roger Guyett, [2005] Lucas has also said that one of the primary influences for the political backdrop behind the Clone Wars, and all of Star Wars, was the Vietnam War and Watergate scandal era, when leaders embraced corruption for what they thought was the best course of action. In 2002, Lucas said: The clone forces shown at the conclusion of Attack of the Clones comprised the largest digital army created for a film at that point. Lucas proposed to concept artists that Revenge of the Sith would open with a montage of seven battles on seven planets. Lucas then radically re-organized the plot; instead of opening the film with various Clone Wars battles, Lucas decided instead to focus on Anakin Skywalker. The absence of the \\"seven battles on seven planets\\" in part led to Lucas's decision to launch the CGI-animated Clone Wars television series; Lucas said the cartoon could \\"do better\\" at depicting the conflict.  Depiction  The Clone Wars was first depicted in Attack of the Clones, the release of which brought an end to Lucas's embargo on licensed material set during the era. Numerous novels, comic books, and video games exploring the conflict have been sanctioned by Lucas Licensing. = Film = Attack of the Clones, set at the beginning of the wars, opens with the Galactic Republic's rising concern about the secession of thousands of star systems to the Confederacy of Independent Systems, which is led by Count Dooku. Chancellor Palpatine manipulates Jar Jar Binks and the rest of the Galactic Senate into granting him emergency powers. Investigating two attempted assassinations of Senator Padm√© Amidala, Obi-Wan Kenobi discovers Dooku used the identity of a dead Jedi master to secretly arrange the creation of a massive clone army on the Republic's behalf. Yoda leads the clone army to rescue Obi-Wan, Padm√©, and Anakin Skywalker from the Separatists on Geonosis, and the first battle of the war ensues. At the battle's conclusion, Yoda declares: \\"Begun, the Clone War has\\". In the final scene of the movie, Anakin and Padm√© get married in secret, in violation of Anakin's Jedi vows. Revenge of the Sith shows the waning days of the three-year Clone Wars, in which clone soldiers and their Jedi generals have fought against the Separatist droid army. After killing Dooku and rescuing Palpatine from the Separatists during their assault on Coruscant, Anakin learns Padm√© is pregnant. He becomes troubled by visions of her death in childbirth, and Palpatine lures Anakin to the dark side of the Force by promising to teach him how to prevent her premature demise. Meanwhile, Yoda is dispatched to Kashyyyk to stave off a Separatist invasion, and Obi-Wan Kenobi is dispatched to Utapau where he kills General Grievous. Anakin discovers Palpatine is a Sith Lord, but he defends him against Mace Windu because he needs Palpatine's knowledge to save Padm√©. After Palpatine murders Windu, he dubs Anakin his new apprentice Darth Vader. Palpatine orders the clone troopers to execute Order 66, and clones kill their Jedi generals across the galaxy. Palpatine then dispatches Vader to kill the Separatist leaders on Mustafar and to issue a \\"shutdown command\\" to their droid army. With their demise, Palpatine declares an end to the Clone Wars and the Republic's reformation into the Galactic Empire. = Animation = The 2D-animated Clone Wars series (2003‚Äì2005) depicts several Clone Wars battles and was meant to generate interest in Revenge of the Sith. It also depicts the prelude to the opening battle of Revenge of the Sith and Palpatine's capture by General Grievous. Several years later, Lucas chose to reboot the series as a 3D CGI series developed by Dave Filoni. After several years of production on the new television series, Lucas decided to spin off the first four episodes as a standalone film. The film, released in 2008, introduces Ahsoka Tano as Anakin's apprentice and depicts the Republic and the Separatists battling and attempting to gain permission to travel through Jabba the Hutt's territory. The television series that followed (2008‚Äì2020) is likewise set against the backdrop of the Clone Wars. The show offers additional details about the clone army's creation, depicts numerous confrontations and developments from the conflict, and portrays the interaction between the clone troopers and their Jedi commanders. For example, the series reveals that each clone has an \\"inhibitor chip\\" in his body that makes most of them obey Order 66. = Novels = The 2008 novelization of The Clone Wars by Karen Traviss begins a series of five novels by Traviss and Karen Miller published by Del Rey Books between 2008 and 2010. The Clone Wars: Wild Space (2008) was written by Miller and focuses on Obi-Wan and Bail Organa. Traviss returned to write The Clone Wars: No Prisoners (2009), in which Ahsoka is temporarily assigned to Captain Rex. Finally, Miller wrote the two-part Clone Wars Gambit (2010), subtitled Stealth and Siege, which deals with a bioweapon threat by Neimoidian general Lok Durd. Dark Disciple (2015) novelizes a story arc about Asajj Ventress and Quinlan Vos from eight unfinished episodes of The Clone Wars. Catalyst: A Rogue One Novel (2016) is set during the Clone Wars and the subsequent couple of years. Thrawn: Alliances (2018) features flashbacks to the last year of the war featuring Anakin, Padm√©, and Thrawn. = Comics = Dark Horse Comics published various comics set during the era, many of which were collected in a series of trade paperbacks over nine volumes. Dark Horse also published a ten- volume graphic novella series titled Clone Wars ‚Äì Adventures (2004‚Äì07), utilizing the style of the 2D animated series and depicting original stories set during the era. A series of comics tying into the 3D animated series was released from 2008 to 2010, collected in three volumes, and was supplemented by an series of graphic novellas released between 2008 and 2013. The Kanan (sometimes subtitled The Last Padawan) comic series depicts the Star Wars Rebels character Kanan Jarrus as Jedi Padawan Caleb Dume during the conflict. = Video games = LucasArts also produced video games like Republic Commando and The Clone Wars that depict the Clone Wars. Analysis Comparisons have been made between the political aspects of the Clone Wars and the events leading up to World War II. Radio host Clyde Lewis' article on historical similarities in Star Wars claims that Palpatine's tactics parallel those of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany; both leaders used wars and scapegoats to manipulate society's emotional state, thus providing the leadership with support and power. Another writer compares the Clone Wars with World War II in general, basing his argument on the fact that Lucas was a baby boomer, and the dark times featured in the original trilogy rival the dark, uncertain Cold War. Referring to Lucas's statements that the conflict in Star Wars was inspired by the cultural backdrop of the Vietnam War, journalist Chris Taylor said the Clone Wars are a parallel to World War II. Anne Lancashire from the University of Toronto also points out some similar nomenclature between the Clone Wars and the American Civil War. Several publications compared the political context of the Clone Wars to the Iraq War. In claiming that the Star Wars galaxy under the deceitful Palpatine parallels the modern issues of the United States, an editorial on Antiwar.com states that Star Wars \\"establishes first the generally agreeable premise that it's right to overthrow oppressive government, before bringing into focus something more discomforting ‚Äì that the corrupt tyranny referred to is our own\\". Additionally, an article from Wiretap claims that \\"like Palpatine, the Bush administration has been able to feed on people's fears to gain more power\\". Lucas stated that the Iraq war \\"didn't exist\\" when he developed the Clone Wars, but he did see parallels between the Vietnam War that inspired Star Wars and the war in Iraq. Star Wars producer Rick McCallum corroborated that the Clone Wars was developed before the Iraq War, adding that Lucas \\"is a product of Vietnam\\". Impact and critical response The author of How Star Wars Conquered the Universe, Chris Taylor, calls the Clone Wars \\"a major part of Star Wars lore\\". In its attempt to keep its Star Wars line of toys active after Return of the Jedi (1983), Kenner devised a storyline that would involve the return of an exiled \\"genetic terrorist\\" and his Clone Warriors. Timothy Zahn said the clones' unexpected appearance fighting for \\"the good guys\\" in Attack of the Clones‚Äîdespite many years of fan speculation that the clones were an invading force‚Äîwas \\"wonderfully blindsid[ing]\\". After seeing the CGI Clone Wars television show, Zahn was grateful that Lucasfilm rejected his initial Heir to the Empire draft, which involved an insane clone of Obi-Wan created during the conflict.

Apple Mail grew out of NeXTMail, which was originally developed by NeXT as part of its NeXTSTEP operating system, after Apple's acquisition of NeXT in 1997. The current version of Apple Mail utilizes SMTP for message sending, POP3, Exchange and IMAP for message retrieval and S/MIME for end-to-end message encryption. It is also preconfigured to work with popular email providers, such as Yahoo! Mail, AOL Mail, Gmail, Outlook and iCloud (formerly MobileMe) and it supports Exchange. iOS features a mobile version of Apple Mail with added Exchange ActiveSync (EAS) support, though it notoriously missed the functionality of attaching files to reply emails until the release of iOS 9. EAS is not supported in the macOS version of Apple's Mail app, the main issue being that sent messages will incorrectly be duplicated in the sent messages folder, which then propagates via sync to all other devices including iOS. Features of Apple Mail include the ability to configure the software to receive all of a user's email accounts in the one list, ability to file emails into folders, ability to search for emails, and ability to automatically append signatures to outgoing emails. It also integrates with the Contacts list, Calendar, Maps and other apps. History =NeXTMail= Apple Mail was originally developed by NeXT as NeXTMail, the email application for its NeXTSTEP operating system. It supported rich text formatting with images and voice messaging, and MIME emails. It also supported plain text (TUI) to allow for backwards compatibility. When Apple began to adapt NeXTSTEP to become Mac OS X, both the operating system and the application went through various stages as it was developed. In a beta version (codenamed \\"Rhapsody\\") and various other early pre-releases of Mac OS X, Mail was known as MailViewer. However, with the third developer release of Mac OS X, the application had returned to being known simply as Mail. =First release= Apple Mail was included in all versions of macOS up to and including Mac OS X Panther, which was released on October 24, 2003. It was integrated with other Apple applications such as Address Book, iChat, and iCal. Some of its features that remain in the most recent version of Mail include rules for mailboxes, junk mail filtering and multiple account management. =Mac OS X Tiger= In Mac OS X Tiger (version 10.4), Mail version 2 included a proprietary single-message- per-file format (with the filename extension .emlx) to permit indexing by Spotlight. Additional features were: * \\"Smart mailboxes\\" that used Spotlight technology to sort mail into folders. * the ability to flag messages with a low, normal or high priority and to use these priorities in mailbox rules and smart mailboxes. * tools for resizing photos before they are sent to avoid oversized email attachments. * the ability to view emailed pictures as a full- screen slideshow. * parental controls to specify who is allowed to send email to children. * HTML message composition. The new version also changed the UI for the buttons in the toolbar. Whereas previous buttons had free-standing defined shapes, the new buttons featured shapes within a lozenge-shaped capsule. According to many users, and even Apple's own human interface guidelines at the time, this was worse for usability. An open-source third- party application that reverted the icons to their former shapes was available. Nevertheless, Apple updated their guidelines to include capsule- shaped buttons, and the new UI persisted. =Mac OS X Leopard= In Mac OS X Leopard (version 10.5), Mail version 3 included personalized stationery, handled in standard HTML format. In addition, it offered notes and to-dos (which could be synced with iCal) as well as a built-in RSS reader. It also introduced IMAP IDLE support for account inboxes. =Mac OS X Snow Leopard= Mac OS X Snow Leopard (version 10.6) brought Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 support. The iCal and Address Book applications bundled with OS X 10.6. =Mac OS X Lion= In Mac OS X Lion (version 10.7), Mail featured a redesigned iPad- like user interface with full-screen capabilities, an updated message search interface, support for Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 and Yahoo! Mail (via IMAP). Also added was the capability to group messages by subject in a similar fashion to Mail on iOS 4. The bounce function, where unwanted emails could be bounced back to the sender, was dropped, as was support for Exchange push email. =OS X Mountain Lion= In OS X Mountain Lion (version 10.8), Mail received VIP tagging, Safari-style inline search for words within an email message, the ability to sync with iCloud and new sharing features. Notes was split off into a stand-alone application. The RSS reader and to-dos were discontinued. =OS X Mavericks= In OS X Mavericks (version 10.9), Mail ceased support for plain-text MIME multipart/alternative messages and solely retained the HTML or rich-text version. =OS X Yosemite= In OS X Yosemite (version 10.10), Mail introduced Markup (inline annotation of PDF or image files) and Mail Drop (automatically uploads attachments to iCloud, and sends a link in the message instead of the whole file). =OS X El Capitan= In OS X El Capitan (version 10.11), a filter was added to the message list to filter by various options such as Unread, Flagged, or messages with attachments. The conversation display was also redesigned and various disk space saving optimizations were implemented. Streaming notification support for Exchange accounts was also added. =macOS Mojave= Support for macOS's new \\"dark mode\\" was added to Mail. =macOS Catalina= Added support for Block Sender, Unsubscribe, Mute Thread and layout options.

Life Lucas was fundamental in establishing an extension of the famous Paris culinary school in London in the 1930s. In 1931 she and Rosemary Hume set up a cookery school in London as they had both trained in Paris. They had a flat in Chelsea and they would reputedly serve their students' creations to passing trade at chairs and tables on the pavement. Lucas is thought to have helped Hume create her first cookery book, as Hume's spelling was known to be poor. Lucas worked as a hotel chef in Hamburg before World War II and later claimed that Adolf Hitler often dined there and had a taste for stuffed squab. She later opened a Cordon Bleu restaurant and a cooking school in New York. She also ran the Egg Basket restaurant by Bloomingdale's in New York. One of the earliest television cook- show hosts, Lucas's To The Queen's Taste was broadcast on CBS in 1948-1949 from the restaurant. She had another show in the 1950s. Dione Lucas was the first woman featured in a cooking show on television on WPIX-11 in New York.Dione Lucas - Cook Books In one of her New York restaurants, The Gingerman, Lucas helped to introduce the omelette to the American palate.

Today it is within the municipal boundaries of Kirkland Lake, Ontario. It has frequently been noted on lists of unusual place names. Swastika is a junction on the Ontario Northland Railway, where a branch to Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec leaves the ONR's main line from North Bay, Ontario to Moosonee. Until 2012, the Northlander passenger railway service between Toronto and Cochrane served the Swastika railway station with connecting bus service running along Highway 66 into downtown Kirkland Lake. History Lucky Cross Mill in Swastika (1918) Train station in Swastika, Ontario The town was named after the Swastika Gold Mine staked in the autumn of 1907 and incorporated on January 6, 1908. James and William Dusty staked the claims alongside Otto Lake for the Tavistock Mining Partnership. Even though there is a legend that it is named after an Indian Sanskrit word for \\"Good luck\\", the gold mine and town were named after the Sanskrit good-luck symbol Swastika. The Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway had an engineers' camp nearby as they had to construct two railway bridges as they advanced northwards. The first usage of the name Swastika occurred in their 1907 Annual Report to indicate a water tank was located at the site to meet the needs of the steam trains that opened up northern Ontario. Prospectors and miners flocked to the area and after viewing the find at the Swastika Gold Mine they advanced even further throughout the surrounding region. In 1909 the Lucky Cross Mine adjacent to the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway tracks began producing gold. A Mr. Morrisson started a farm and lodging alongside the tracks as early as 1907 and from there the community developed. Swastika had a population of 450 by 1911, with the Lucky Cross and Swastika Mines in operation. By 1911, a hotel and businesses were flourishing, the area to the east was heavily staked and in 1912 the major gold mines of Kirkland Lake were found and developed by Harry Oakes. Swastika was the main transportation link with the railway and communications centre. Churches, schools, community groups and organisations continued to provide the needs of the residents of the area. The Swastika Mine was later called the Crescent Mine. In 2008, the small community of Swastika celebrated the town's centennial.

Fagundes, together with his second captain P√™ro de Barcelos, and accompanied by colonists (mostly from the Azores and some from mainland Portugal), explored the islands of St Paul near Cape Breton, Sable Island, Penguin Island (now known as Funk Island), Burgeo, and Saint Pierre and Miquelon, which he named the islands of Eleven Thousand Virgins in honor of Saint Ursula.Ganong, W.

In 1607, Samuel de Champlain identified the remains of a large cross (\\"an old cross, all covered with moss, and almost wholly rotted away\\") at what is now Advocate, Nova Scotia on the Minas Basin.

They obtained a license From King Manuel for an expedition under the command of Jo√£o Alvares Fagundes, who led several families and couples, mostly from the Azores, especially from the island of Terceira, who were gathered en route. They reached North America with a nau and a caravel, and \\"because they considered the coast of Newfoundland very cold, they sailed from east to west\\" until they reached a new \\"coast, arranged from northeast to southwest, and there they dwelt, where they lost or ran out of ships\\"; nothing more was known of \\"the colonists who settled there since they were out of communications with the metropole.\\" Only later did news of the fate of the colonists come through the reports of Basque fishermen who visited the region. The Basques brought information of the colony and its inhabitants and descendants \\"and said that they were asked to let the authorities in Portugal know about their situation in the land and to send them priests, because the Gentiles [possibly the Mi'kmaq people] \\"are peaceful and docile, and from notorious men that are sailing there.\\" According to Souza, it was in Cape Brit√£o (Cape Breton in old Portuguese - already having that name in 1570 due to the expeditions of Jacques Cartier and others), \\"at the entrance of the north coast, in a beautiful bay\\", according to the chronicler, \\"which had a settlement, with very valuable things, and a lot of walnut, chestnut, grapes, and other fruits, where it seems to be good land and so among this company were some couples from the Azores; that they have settled here as is well-known\\".

It is considered to be \\"the Gateway to the Arctic\\" and has Ontario's only saltwater port. Nearby on Moose Factory Island is the community of Moose Factory to which it is connected by water taxi in the summer and ice road in the winter. Moosonee is the railhead of the Ontario Northland Railway where goods are transferred to barges and aircraft for transport to more northerly communities. Moosonee is not particularly far north, being located at 51¬∞N‚Äîwhich is roughly the same latitude as Saskatoon, Calgary, London (UK), and Berlin‚Äîbut is colder due to its proximity to Hudson Bay, and isolated due to its lack of road access to the rest of Ontario. The community was the site of a fur trading post set up in 1903 by Revillon Fr√®res, competitors to the Hudson's Bay Company which later bought out R√©villon. Moosonee formerly held the status of a development area, the only community in the province with that designation, and was governed by a locally elected board subject to formal appointment by the Ontario provincial government. It became incorporated as a town effective January 1, 2001, with an elected mayor and four-person council. The most recent municipal council was elected on October 27, 2014, and three replacement councillors were elected in a by-election held on July 7, 2015. For 2014-2018 the town council consists of mayor Wayne Taipale, and councillors Tony Tourville, John Moore, Carman Tozer and Cathy Turner. History R√©villon Fr√®res store in Moosonee In 1900, Annie Hardisty and her two daughters were the first settlers on the site. But the place really developed when on June 6, 1903, four canoes and a crew of 21 persons of the R√©villon Fr√®res company arrived on the banks of the Moose River near the much older Moose Factory to establish the Moose River Post. This Parisian furrier had ambitious plans to set up a chain of fur trading posts in direct competition with the Hudson's Bay Company, including five on James Bay. But it suffered a setback when their supply ship that carried all the provisions shipwrecked near Fort George. Moose River Post became the most important location for R√©villon Fr√®res and was quickly expanded with a staff house, carpenter's shop, warehouse, and sawmill. The buildings were spaced far apart as a preventive measure to minimize the spread of fire. By 1912, it was reported that \\"the whole line of good substantial buildings, built principally for their French Canadian employees, stretches along the river front for nearly a mile northward from the residence of the inspector.\\" Moose River Post (and Moose Factory) were prosperous but isolated. It was supplied only once per year by ship coming from Montreal around the Labrador Peninsula. Mail arrived only four times per year, twice by canoe and twice by toboggan. During World War I, R√©villon Fr√®res' chartered supply ship was requisitioned for war service. So from then on until 1932, the post was supplied by scows from Pagwa on the National Transcontinental Railway coming down the Pagwachuan, Kenogami, and Albany Rivers. In 1932, the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway was extended from Cochrane to Moose River Post, that was renamed at that time to Moosonee, derived from the Cree word M√¥sonihk meaning \\"at the Moose [River]\\". In 1936, R√©villon Fr√®res sold its Canadian operations to the Hudson's Bay Company and the Moosonee post closed. The HBC also exited the fur trade and opened a retail store in Moosonee (now Northern Store part of The North West Company). With the end of the fur trade business, Moosonee's economy became centered on transportation. In 1962, Moosonee became the site of RCAF Station Moosonee that was part of NORAD's Pinetree Line chain of radar stations. It closed in 1975 and some of its buildings were used by the Town after the closure, including the base swimming pool and recreation centre. In 1968, the town was classified as a Development Area Board. In November 2000, it was incorporated as the Town of Moosonee. Demographics The population was 1,725 in 2011, down from 2,006 in the Statistics Canada 2006 Census, although there are about 3,500 people by municipal government estimate. Census figures for Moosonee may be inaccurate because of incomplete enumeration, a common problem with remote communities. About 85 per cent of the population are native Cree. The number of total private dwellings is 635 of which 545 are occupied by usual residents. Population density per square kilometre is 3.6. The most recent detailed census information available for Moosonee is from 2011. Mother tongue was 79.3% English, 17.7% Cree, 1.8% French, and 1.2% other language. The town was 75.7% First Nations, 17.3% White, and 5.4% M√©tis (1996 data). Services Moosonee has two elementary schools, Moosonee Public School and Bishop Belleau Separate School (Roman Catholic) that offer kindergarten through grade eight. Bishop Belleau School also provides a French Language Instructional Unit for children who are entitled to be educated in French. There is a public high school, Northern Lights Secondary School, that provides grades nine through twelve. Northern College's Moosonee campus provides some post-secondary programs. Health services are provided through the Moosonee Health Clinic of the Weeneebayko Area Health Authority (merger of the formerly James Bay General Hospital and the Weeneebayko Health Ahtuskaywin which operated Weeneebayko General Hospital in Moose Factory). Payukotayno (pronounced pay-k-ta-no) Family Services provide child care and social assistance to Moosonee, Moose Factory, Attawapiskat First Nation, Fort Albany, Kashechewan and Peawanuck. Payukotayno is a recognized Ontario Children's Aid Society and means 'one family' in Cree. Climate Moosonee has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfb), with warm summers and cold winters. James Bay acts as a thermal reservoir to moderate spring and fall temperatures. Freeze-up on the Moose River normally occurs between late November and mid-December, with mean daily minimum January temperatures approximately . Spring break-up, or spring thaw, usually occurs in April. Mean annual precipitation is approximately , and mean annual snowfall is approximately . Precipitation is somewhat higher in summer than at other times of the year. Severe thunderstorms can occur from time to time. Moosonee used to have a subarctic climate (Dfc) with an annual daily mean temperature of -1.3 ¬∞C (29.7 ¬∞F), but due to global warming that temperature has risen. The highest temperature ever recorded in Moosonee was on 31 July 1975. The coldest temperature ever recorded was on 24 January 1935. Transportation =Moosonee Station and Yard= The Polar Bear Express at Moosonee Station The main method of access is by Ontario Northland Railway which reached the town in 1932 and which provides passenger and freight train service to Cochrane. Ontario Northland's Polar Bear Express train runs from Moosonee station to Cochrane six days per week during the summer months and five days per week during the rest of the year. Moosonee Station is located at the end of First Street and has a small station building, freight shed, diesel shed and an outdoor yard to store trains. There are also two freight trains per week. During the summer and early fall shipping season, goods can be transported from Moosonee by barge. In January 2007, responsibility for the Port of Moosonee was transferred from the federal government to the Town of Moosonee. =Airport= The town is also accessible via the Moosonee Airport, served with scheduled flights of Air Creebec, Moosonee Water Aerodrome and cargo service through North Star Air. =Roads= Moosonee is inaccessible by road. The nearest road outside of Moosonee ends at Otter Rapids which is south of Moosonee. During the early months of 2008, a winter road was open between Moosonee and the provincial road system at Otter Rapids. This road was built to support the twinning of the electric transmission lines that run from Otter Rapids to Moosonee. Local residents report it taking five or six hours to get to Timmins from Moosonee via Otter Rapids and Smooth Rock Falls. This road was not in service in 2009. In late 2009, members of the Moose Cree First Nation voted for the construction of a seasonal winter road south to Otter Rapids. During the winter, ice roads are plowed and maintained on the ice across the Moose River to Moose Factory and winter roads are maintained to the coastal communities of Fort Albany, Kashechewan and Attawapiskat. In recent years, much of the traffic heading up north has been destined for the Victor Diamond Mine operated by De Beers Canada to the west of Attawapiskat. Feasibility studies have been undertaken on the construction of a permanent all-season road to the communities of Moosonee, Fort Albany, Kashechewan and Attawapiskat River.\\"Ontario's far north one step closer to building all-season road\\". CBC Sudbury, September 17, 2017. The project, if undertaken, will entail a \\"coastal road\\" connecting the four communities with each other, as well as a road to link the coastal road to the provincial highway system at Fraserdale, Kapuskasing or Hearst.\\"All Season Road\\". Mushkegowuk Council. Communications Moosonee has a local radio station, CHMO 1450 AM, that is generally operated by volunteers, plus a rebroadcasting facility for CBC Radio One Northern Ontario from CBCS-FM Sudbury on 1340 AM. Most homes subscribe to either Creecable cable TV or a satellite TV service to access any television service, following the 2012 closure of the local CBC Television and TVOntario repeaters. Ontera, formerly Ontario Northland Telecommunications, but now owned by Bell, provides telecommunications service in Moosonee (NPA-NXX 705-336).

It belongs to the same genus as the Indian rhinoceros, and has similar mosaic, armour-like skin, but at in length and in height, it is smaller (closer in size to the black rhinoceros of the genus Diceros). Its horn is usually shorter than , and is smaller than those of the other rhino species. Only adult males have horns; females lack them altogether. Once the most widespread of Asian rhinoceroses, the Javan rhinoceros ranged from the islands of Java and Sumatra, throughout Southeast Asia, and into India and China. The species is critically endangered, with only one known population in the wild, and no individuals in captivity. It is possibly the rarest large mammal on Earth, with a population of as few as 58 to 61 in Ujung Kulon National Park at the western tip of Java in Indonesia. The Javan rhinoceros population in Vietnam's Cat Tien National Park was declared to be locally extinct in 2011. The decline of the Javan rhinoceros is attributed to poaching, primarily for their horns, which are highly valued in traditional Chinese medicine, fetching as much as US$30,000 per kg on the black market. As European presence in their range increased, trophy hunting also became a serious threat. Loss of habitat, especially as the result of wars, such as the Vietnam War, in Southeast Asia, has also contributed to the species' decline and hindered recovery. The remaining range is within one nationally protected area, but the rhinos are still at risk from poachers, disease, and loss of genetic diversity leading to inbreeding depression. The Javan rhino can live around 30‚Äì45 years in the wild. It historically inhabited lowland rain forest, wet grasslands, and large floodplains. It is mostly solitary, except for courtship and offspring- rearing, though groups may occasionally congregate near wallows and salt licks. Aside from humans, adults have no predators in their range. The Javan rhino usually avoids humans. Scientists and conservationists rarely study the animals directly due to their extreme rarity and the danger of interfering with such an endangered species. Researchers rely on camera traps and fecal samples to gauge health and behavior. Consequently, the Javan rhino is the least studied of all rhino species. Two adult rhinos with their calves were filmed in a motion-triggered video released on 28 February 2011 by WWF and Indonesia's National Park Authority, which proved it is still breeding in the wild. In April 2012, the National Parks Authority released video showing 35 individual Javan rhinos, including mother/offspring pairs and courting adults. There are only 58 to 68 individuals left in the wild, and none in captivity, after the death of a male rhinoceros named Samson. Samson died in April 2018 at 30 years of age, far younger than the species' usual lifespan of 50 to 60 years, so DNA testing is being conducted to explore the cause of death, including the possibility of inbreeding degeneration.  Etymology  The genus name Rhinoceros is a combination of the ancient Greek words ·ø•ŒØœÇ (ris) meaning 'nose' and Œ∫Œ≠œÅŒ±œÇ (keras) meaning 'horn of an animal'. sondaicus is derived from sunda, the biogeographical region that comprises the islands of Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and surrounding smaller islands. The Javan rhino is also known as the lesser one-horned rhinoceros (in contrast with the greater one-horned rhinoceros, another name for the Indian rhino).  Taxonomy  Rhinoceros sondaicus was the scientific name used by Anselme Ga√´tan Desmarest in 1822 for a rhinoceros from Java sent by Pierre-M√©dard Diard and Alfred Duvaucel to the National Museum of Natural History, France. In the 19th century, several zoological specimens of hornless rhinoceros were described: *Rhinoceros inermis proposed by Ren√© Lesson in 1838 was a female rhinoceros without horns shot in the Sundarbans. *Rhinoceros nasalis and Rhinoceros floweri proposed by John Edward Gray in 1867 were two rhinoceros skulls from Borneo and one from Sumatra, respectively. *Rhinoceros annamiticus proposed by Pierre Marie Heude in 1892 was a specimen from Vietnam. As of 2005, three Javan rhinoceros subspecies are considered valid taxa: * R. s. sondaicus, the nominate subspecies, known as the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros * R. s. inermis, known as the Indian Javan rhinoceros or lesser Indian rhinoceros * R. s. annamiticus, known as the Vietnamese Javan rhinoceros or Vietnamese rhinoceros = Evolution = The Indian rhinoceros pictured here is the species most closely related to the Javan rhinoceros; they are the two members of the type genus Rhinoceros. Ancestral rhinoceroses are held to have first diverged from other perissodactyls in the Early Eocene. Mitochondrial DNA comparison suggests the ancestors of modern rhinos split from the ancestors of Equidae around 50 million years ago. The extant family, the Rhinocerotidae, first appeared in the Late Eocene in Eurasia, and the ancestors of the extant rhino species dispersed from Asia beginning in the Miocene. The Indian and Javan rhinoceros, the only members of the genus Rhinoceros, first appear in the fossil record in Asia During the Early Pleistocene. The oldest known record of the species is from Early Pleistocene (~1.5 Ma) deposits at Trinil, Java. Molecular estimates suggest the two species diverged from each other much earlier, around 11.7 million years ago. Although belonging to the type genus, the Indian and Javan rhinoceroses are not believed to be closely related to other rhino species. Different studies have hypothesized that they may be closely related to the extinct Gaindatherium or Punjabitherium. A detailed cladistic analysis of the Rhinocerotidae placed Rhinoceros and the extinct Punjabitherium in a clade with Dicerorhinus, the Sumatran rhino. Other studies have suggested the Sumatran rhinoceros is more closely related to the two African species. The Sumatran rhino may have diverged from the other Asian rhinos 15 million years ago, or perhaps as far back as 25.9 million years ago (based on mitochondrial data).  Description  Captive Javan rhino, around 1900 The Javan rhino is smaller than the Indian rhinoceros, and is close in size to the black rhinoceros. It is the largest animal in Java and the second- largest animal in Indonesia after the Asian elephant. The length of the Javan rhino including its head is 2 to 4 metres (6.5 to 13 feet), and it can reach a height of . Adults are variously reported to weigh between , although a study to collect accurate measurements of the animals has never been conducted and is not a priority because of their extreme conservation status. No substantial size difference is seen between genders, but females may be slightly bigger. The rhinos in Vietnam appeared to be significantly smaller than those in Java, based on studies of photographic evidence and measurements of their footprints. Like the Indian rhino, the Javan rhinoceros has a single horn (the other extant species have two horns). Its horn is the smallest of all extant rhinos, usually less than with the longest recorded only . Only males have horns. Female Javan rhinos are the only extant rhinos that remain hornless into adulthood, though they may develop a tiny bump of an inch or two in height. The Javan rhinoceros does not appear to often use its horn for fighting but instead uses it to scrape mud away in wallows, to pull down plants for eating, and to open paths through thick vegetation. Similar to the other browsing species of rhino (Black and Sumatran), the Javan rhino has a long, pointed, upper lip which helps in grabbing food. Its lower incisors are long and sharp; when the Javan rhino fights, it uses these teeth. Behind the incisors, two rows of six low-crowned molars are used for chewing coarse plants. Like all rhinos, the Javan rhino smells and hears well, but has very poor vision. They are estimated to live for 30 to 45 years. Its hairless, splotchy gray or gray-brown skin falls in folds to the shoulder, back and rump. The skin has a natural mosaic pattern, which lends the rhino an armored appearance. The neck folds of the Javan rhinoceros are smaller than those of the Indian rhinoceros, but still, form a saddle shape over the shoulder. Because of the risks of interfering with such an endangered species, however, the Javan rhinoceros is primarily studied through fecal sampling and Camera traps. They are rarely encountered, observed or measured directly.  Distribution and habitat  Java's Ujung Kulon National Park is the home of all remaining Javan rhinos. Even the most optimistic estimate suggests fewer than 100 Javan rhinos remain in the wild. They are considered one of the most endangered species in the world. The Javan rhinoceros is known to survive in only one place, the Ujung Kulon National Park on the western tip of Java. The animal was once widespread from Assam and Bengal (where their range would have overlapped with both the Sumatran and Indian rhinos) eastward to Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and southwards to the Malay Peninsula and the islands of Sumatra, Java, and possibly Borneo. The Javan rhino primarily inhabits dense, lowland rain forests, grasslands, and reed beds with abundant rivers, large floodplains, or wet areas with many mud wallows. Although it historically preferred low-lying areas, the subspecies in Vietnam was pushed onto much higher ground (up to 2,000 m or 6,561 ft), probably because of human encroachment and poaching. The range of the Javan rhinoceros has been shrinking for at least 3,000 years. Starting around 1000 BC, the northern range of the rhinoceros extended into China, but began moving southward at roughly per year, as human settlements increased in the region. It likely became locally extinct in India in the first decade of the 20th century. The Javan rhino was hunted to extinction on the Malay Peninsula by 1932. The last ones on Sumatra died out during World War II. They were extinct from Chittagong and the Sunderbans by the middle of the 20th century. By the end of the Vietnam War, the Vietnamese rhinoceros was believed extinct across all of mainland Asia. Local hunters and woodcutters in Cambodia claim to have seen Javan rhinos in the Cardamom Mountains, but surveys of the area have failed to find any evidence of them. In the late 1980s, a small population was found in the Cat Tien area of Vietnam. However, the last individual of that population was shot in 2010.WWF (25 October 2011) Inadequate protection causes Javan rhino extinction in Vietnam . A population may have existed on the island of Borneo, as well, though these specimens could have been the Sumatran rhinoceros, a small population of which still lives there.  Behavior  A museum specimen of a juvenile R. s. sondaicus The Javan rhinoceros is a solitary animal with the exception of breeding pairs and mothers with calves. They sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Wallowing in mud is a common behavior for all rhinos; the activity allows them to maintain cool body temperatures and helps prevent disease and parasite infestation. The Javan rhinoceros does not generally dig its own mud wallows, preferring to use other animals' wallows or naturally occurring pits, which it will use its horn to enlarge. Salt licks are also very important because of the essential nutrients the rhino receives from the salt. Male home ranges are larger at ) compared to the female, which are around ). Male territories overlap each other less than those of the female. It is not known if there are territorial fights. Males mark their territories with dung piles and by urine spraying. Scrapes made by the feet in the ground and twisted saplings also seem to be used for communication. Members of other rhino species have a peculiar habit of defecating in massive rhino dung piles and then scraping their back feet in the dung. The Sumatran and Javan rhinos, while defecating in piles, do not engage in the scraping. This adaptation in behavior is thought to be ecological; in the wet forests of Java and Sumatra, the method may not be useful for spreading odors. The Javan rhino is much less vocal than the Sumatran; very few Javan rhino vocalizations have ever been recorded. Adults have no known predators other than humans. The species, particularly in Vietnam, is skittish and retreats into dense forests whenever humans are near. Though a valuable trait from a survival standpoint, it has made the rhinos difficult to study. Nevertheless, when humans approach too closely, the Javan rhino becomes aggressive and will attack, stabbing with the incisors of its lower jaw while thrusting upward with its head. Its comparatively antisocial behavior may be a recent adaptation to population stresses; historical evidence suggests they, like other rhinos, were once more gregarious.  Diet  The Javan rhinoceros is herbivorous, eating diverse plant species, especially their shoots, twigs, young foliage and fallen fruit. Most of the plants favored by the species grow in sunny areas in forest clearings, shrubland and other vegetation types with no large trees. The rhino knocks down saplings to reach its food and grabs it with its prehensile upper lip. It is the most adaptable feeder of all the rhino species. Currently, it is a pure browser, but probably once both browsed and grazed in its historical range. The rhino eats an estimated of food daily. Like the Sumatran rhino, it needs salt in its diet. The salt licks common in its historical range do not exist in Ujung Kulon but the rhinos there have been observed drinking seawater, likely for the same nutritional need.  Conservation  A painting from 1861 depicts the hunting of R. s. sondaicus The main factor in the continued decline of the Javan rhinoceros population has been poaching for horns, a problem that affects all rhino species. The horns have been a traded commodity for more than 2,000 years in China, where they are believed to have healing properties. Historically, the rhinoceros' hide was used to make armor for Chinese soldiers, and some local tribes in Vietnam believed the hide could be used to make an antidote for snake venom. Because the rhinoceros' range encompasses many areas of poverty, it has been difficult to convince local people not to kill a seemingly (otherwise) useless animal which could be sold for a large sum of money. When the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora first went into effect in 1975, the Javan rhinoceros was placed under complete Appendix 1 protection; all international trade in the Javan rhinoceros and products derived from it is illegal. Surveys of the rhinoceros horn black market have determined that Asian rhinoceros horn fetches a price as high as $30,000 per kg, three times the value of African rhinoceros horn. As with many types of Asian and African megafauna, the Javan rhino was relentlessly hunted by trophy and big-game hunters for decades following the arrival of Europeans in its range. The rhinos being easy targets, this was as severe a contributor to its decline as was poaching for its horns. Such was the toll of big-game hunting that by the time the rhino's plight was made known to the world, only the Javan and the (then unknown) Vietnamese populations remained. Loss of habitat because of agriculture has also contributed to its decline, though this is no longer as significant a factor because the rhinoceros only lives in one nationally protected park. Deteriorating habitats have hindered the recovery of rhino populations that fell victim to poaching. Even with all the conservation efforts, the prospects for their survival are grim. Because the population is restricted to one small area, they are very susceptible to disease and inbreeding depression. Conservation geneticists estimate a population of 100 rhinos would be needed to preserve the genetic diversity of this conservation- reliant species. = Ujung Kulon = A Dutch hunter with a dead R. s. sondaicus in Ujung Kulon, 1895 The Ujung Kulon peninsula of Java was devastated by the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. The Javan rhinoceros recolonized the peninsula after the event, but humans never returned in large numbers, thus creating a haven for wildlife. In 1931, as the Javan rhinoceros was on the brink of extinction in Sumatra, the government of the Dutch East Indies declared the rhino a legally protected species, which it has remained ever since. A census of the rhinos in Ujung Kulon was first conducted in 1967; only 25 animals were recorded. By 1980, that population had doubled and has remained steady, at about 50, ever since. Although the rhinos in Ujung Kulon have no natural predators, they have to compete for scarce resources with wild cattle, which may keep their numbers below the peninsula's carrying capacity. Ujung Kulon is managed by the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry. Evidence of at least four baby rhinos was discovered in 2006, the most ever documented for the species. In March 2011, a hidden-camera video was published showing adults and juveniles, indicating recent matings and breeding. During the period from January to October 2011, the cameras had captured images of 35 rhinos. As of December 2011, a rhino breeding sanctuary in an area of 38,000 hectares is being finalized to help reach the target of 70 to 80 Javan rhinos by 2015. In April 2012, the WWF and International Rhino Foundation added 120 video cameras to the existing 40 to better monitor rhino movements and judge the size of the animals' population. A recent survey has found far fewer females than males. Only four females among 17 rhinos were recorded in the eastern half of Ujung Kulon, which is a potential setback in efforts to save the species. With Ujung Kulon as the last resort of this species, all the Javan rhinos are in one location, an advantage over the Sumatran rhino which is dispersed in different, unconnected areas. Poaching for their horns is also no longer as serious a threat as in the past, due to stricter international regulations on rhino horn, active protection efforts by local authorities, the rhinos' elusiveness and Ujung Kulon's remoteness. However, there are still obstacles to the species' recovery. Being concentrated in such a relatively small area makes the species extremely susceptible to disease and tsunamis. In 2012, the Asian Rhino Project was working out the best eradication programme for the arenga palm, which was blanketing the park and crowding out the rhinos' food sources. Following the trails of Javan rhinoceros allowed in-depth observation of their feeding habits in their natural habitat. Comparing the acid insoluble ash (MA) content of faeces and in the dry weight of food provided reliable estimates of digestibility, and this method has potential for wider application in situations where total collection of faecal matter is not feasible. There was a strong positive correlation between the size of home range and diversity of food intake, and between the size of home range with the numbers of wallow holes used. The quantity and quality of food intake were variable among rhinoceroses and over time. Overall energy consumption was related to the size of the animal, while the digestibility of plants consumed appeared to be influenced by individual age and habitat conditions. In May 2017, Director of the Biodiversity Conservation at the Ministry of Environment and Forestry, Bambang Dahono Adji announced plans to transfer the rhinos to the Cikepuh Wildlife Sanctuary located in West Java. The animals will first undergo DNA tests to determine lineage and risk to disease so as to avoid issues such as \\"inbreeding\\" or marriage kinship. As of December 2018, these plans had yet to concretely materialise. In December 2018, the remaining Javan rhino population was severely endangered by the tsunami triggered by nearby volcano Anak Krakatau. = Cat Tien = Head of a male R. s. annamiticus shot in Perak on the Malay Peninsula Once widespread in Southeast Asia, the Javan rhinoceros was presumed extinct in Vietnam in the mid-1970s, at the end of the Vietnam War. The combat wrought havoc on the ecosystems of the region through the use of napalm, extensive defoliation from Agent Orange, aerial bombing, use of landmines, and overhunting by local poachers. In 1988, the assumption of the subspecies' extinction was challenged when a hunter shot an adult female, proving the species had somehow survived the war. In 1989, scientists surveyed Vietnam's southern forests to search for evidence of other survivors. Fresh tracks belonging to up to 15 rhinos were found along the Dong Nai River. Largely because of the rhinoceros, the region they inhabited became part of the Cat Tien National Park in 1992. By the early 2000s, their population was feared to have declined past the point of recovery in Vietnam, with some conservationists estimating as few as three to eight rhinos, and possibly no males, survived. Conservationists debated whether or not the Vietnamese rhinoceros had any chance of survival, with some arguing that rhinos from Indonesia should be introduced in an attempt to save the population, with others arguing that the population could recover. Genetic analysis of dung samples collected in Cat Tien National Park in a survey from October 2009 to March 2010 showed only a single individual Javan rhinoceros remained in the park. In early May 2010, the body of a Javan rhino was found in the park. The animal had been shot and its horn removed by poachers. In October 2011, the International Rhino Foundation confirmed the Javan rhinoceros was extinct in Vietnam, leaving only the rhinos in Ujung Kulon. = In captivity = A Javan rhinoceros has not been exhibited in a zoo for over a century. In the 19th century, at least four rhinos were exhibited in Adelaide, Calcutta, and London. At least 22 Javan rhinos have been documented as having been kept in captivity; the true number is possibly greater, as the species was sometimes confused with the Indian rhinoceros. The Javan rhinoceros never fared well in captivity. The oldest lived to be 20, about half the age that the rhinos can reach in the wild. No records are known of a captive rhino giving birth. The last captive Javan rhino died at the Adelaide Zoo in Australia in 1907, where the species was so little known that it had been exhibited as an Indian rhinoceros. In culture Rhino tormenting the damned in the \\"heaven and hell\\" gallery at Angkor Wat (12th century) The Javan rhinoceros occurred in Cambodia in the past and there are at least three depictions of rhinos in the bas reliefs of the temple at Angkor Wat. The west wing of the North Gallery has a relief that shows a rhino mounted by a god thought to be the fire god Agni. The rhinos are thought to be Javan rhinoceros rather than the somewhat similar looking one-horned Indian rhino on the basis of the skinfold on the shoulder which continues along the back in the Javan to give a saddle-like appearance. A depiction of the rhino in the east wing of the South Gallery shows a rhino attacking the damned in the panel depicting heaven and hell. An architect of the temple is thought to have been an Indian Brahmin priest named Divakarapandita (1040‚Äì1120 AD) who served king Jayavarman VI, Dharanindravarman I as well as Suryavarman II who constructed the temple. It is thought that the Indian priest who died before the construction of the temple might have influenced the use of tubercles on the skin which are based on the Indian rhino while the local Khmer artisans carved the other details of the rhinos based on the more familiar local Javan rhino. The association of the rhinoceros as the vahana of the god Agni is unique to Khmer culture. Another rhinoceros carving in the centre of a circular arrangement in a column with other circles containing elephants and water buffalo is known from the temple of Ta Prohm. It has been at the centre of anachronistic speculation that it might represent a Stegosaur due to the leaves behind it that give the impression of plates.  Threats  According to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) the Javan rhino is the most threatened rhino species with only 68‚Äì74 remaining in Ujung Kulon National Park in Java, Indonesia. The WWF has listed several threats faced by the Javan rhino that result in its designation as \\"critically endangered\\". One of those threats is its \\"reduced genetic diversity\\", because the low number of existing Javan rhinos results in a low amount of genetic diversity and increased inbreeding, making it difficult for the Javan rhino to survive. The WWF also identifies \\"natural disasters\\" as another threat faced by Javan rhinos, because Ujung National Park can be affected by tsunamis or the explosion of the nearby volcano Anak Krakatau, which potentially could wipe out the entire Javan rhino species. One such eruption and tsunami in 2018 wreaked heavy damage on the Pandeglang Regency, the district which contains Ujung Kulon National Park. However, the park and its rhino population were not significantly affected. A third threat identified by the WWF is \\"disease\\", given that four Javan rhinos are believed to have died from a disease transmitted to them by wild cattle. Another threat is \\"habitat degradation\\", since the WWF reports that people are encroaching and developing areas near the Ujung National Park and thus destroying the last known habitat of the Javan rhino.

They led a rebellion against the absolute rule of Sultan Abdul Hamid II in the 1908 Young Turk Revolution. With this revolution, the Young Turks helped to establish the Second Constitutional Era in 1908, ushering in an era of multi-party democracy for the first time in the country's history. Despite working with Young Ottomans to promulgate a constitution, Abdul Hamid II had dissolved the parliament by 1878 and returned to an absolutist regime, marked by extensive use of secret police to silence dissent, and by massacres committed against minorities. Constitutionalist opponents of his regime, most prominently Prince Sabahaddin and Ahmet Rƒ±za, among other intellectuals, came to be known as Young Turks. Despite the name, Young Turks included many Arabs, Albanians, Jews, and initially, Armenians and Greeks. To organize the opposition, progressive medical students Ibrahim Temo, Abdullah Cevdet and others formed a secret organization named the Committee of Ottoman Union (later Committee of Union and Progress - CUP), which grew in size and included exiles, civil servants, and army officers. Finally, in 1908, pro-CUP officers marched the army to Istanbul, forcing Abdul Hamid to restore the constitution, and later deposed him. Young Turks were a heterodox group of liberal intellectuals and revolutionaries, united by their opposition to the absolutist regime of Abdul Hamid and desire to reinstate the constitution. After the sultan's overthrow, Young Turks began to splinter and two main factions formed: more liberal and pro-decentralization Young Turks (including CUP's original founders) formed the Freedom and Accord Party (also known as the Liberal Union or Liberal Entente), and the Turkish nationalist, pro-centralization and radical wing among the Young Turks remained in the Party of Union and Progress. The groups' power struggle continued until 1913, when CUP seized power from Freedom and Accord with a coup. The new CUP leadership (Three Pashas) then exercised absolute control over the Ottoman Empire, overseeing the empire's entry into World War I on the side of the Central Powers during the war. Following the war, the struggle between the two groups of Young Turks revived, with the Freedom and Accord Party regaining control of the Ottoman government and Three Pashas fleeing into exile. Freedom and Accord rule was short lived, however, and the empire soon collapsed. The term \\"Young Turk\\" is now used to signify \\"a progressive, revolutionary, or rebellious member of an organization, political party, etc, especially one agitating for radical reform\\". and various groups in different countries have been named Young Turks because of their rebellious or revolutionary nature. History =Origins= Members of the Young Turks: ƒ∞shak S√ºkuti, Ser√¢ceddin Bey, Tunalƒ± Hilmi, √Çkil Muhtar, Mithat ≈û√ºkr√º, Emin Bey, Lutfi Bey, Doctor ≈ûefik Bey, N√ªri Ahmed, Doctor Reshid and M√ºnif Bey Inspired by the Young Italy political movement, the Young Turks had their origins in secret societies of \\"progressive medical university students and military cadets,\\" namely the Young Ottomans, driven underground along with all political dissent after the Constitution of 1876 was abolished and the First Constitutional Era brought to a close by Abdul Hamid II in 1878 after only two years. The Young Turks favored a reinstatement of the Ottoman Parliament and the 1876 constitution, written by the progressive Midhat Pasha. =Congress of Ottoman Opposition= The first congress of the Ottoman opposition (1902) in Paris The First Congress of Ottoman Opposition was held on 4 February 1902,at 20:00, at the house of Germain Antoin Lefevre-Pontalis a member of the Institut de France. The opposition was performed in compliance with the French government. Closed to the public, there were 47 delegates present. The Armenians wanted to have the conversations held in French, but other delegates rejected this proposition. The Second Congress of Ottoman Opposition took place in Paris, France, in 1907. Opposition leaders including Ahmed Rƒ±za, Sabahaddin Bey, and Khachatur Malumian of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation were in attendance. The goal was to unite all the parties, including the Young Turks' Committee of Union and Progress, in order to bring about the revolution. =1906‚Äì1908= The Young Turks became a truly organized movement with the Committee of Union and Progress (CUP) as an organizational umbrella. They recruited individuals hoping for the establishment of a constitutional monarchy in the Ottoman Empire. In 1906, the Ottoman Freedom Society (OFS) was established in Thessalonica by Mehmed Talaat. The OFS actively recruited members from the Third Army base, among them Major Ismail Enver. In September 1907, OFS announced they would be working with other organizations under the umbrella of the CUP. In reality, the leadership of the OFS would exert significant control over the CUP. Young Turk Revolution Young Turks flyer with the slogan \\"Long live the fatherland, long live the nation, long live liberty\\" written in Ottoman Turkish and French. In 1908, the Macedonian Question was facing the Ottoman Empire. Tsar Nicholas II and Franz Joseph, who were both interested in the Balkans, started implementing policies, beginning in 1897, which brought on the last stages of the Balkanization process. By 1903, there were discussions on establishing administrative control by Russian and Austrian advisory boards in the Macedonian provinces. The ruling House of Osman was forced to accept this idea, although for quite a while they were able to subvert its implementation. However, eventually, signs were showing that this policy game was coming to an end. On May 13, 1908, the leadership of the Committee of Union and Progress, with the newly gained power of its organization, was able to communicate to Sultan Abdul Hamid II the unveiled threat that \\"the [Ottoman] dynasty would be in danger\\" if he were not to bring back the Ottoman constitution that he had previously suspended since 1878. On June 12, 1908, the Third Army, which was in Macedonia, began its march towards the Palace in Constantinople. Although initially resistant to the idea of giving up absolute power, Abdul Hamid was forced on July 24, 1908, to restore the constitution, beginning the Second Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. =Second Constitutional Era= Declaration of the Young Turk Revolution by the leaders of the Ottoman millets in 1908 The unity among the Young Turks that originated from the Young Turk Revolution began to splinter in face of the realities of the ongoing dissolution of the Ottoman Empire, especially with the onset of the Balkan Wars in 1912. World War I On November 2, 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the Central Powers. The Middle Eastern theatre of World War I became the scene of action. The combatants were the Ottoman Empire, with some assistance from the other Central Powers, against primarily the British and the Russians among the Allies. Rebuffed elsewhere by the major European powers, the Young Turks, through highly secret diplomatic negotiations, led the Ottoman Empire to ally itself with Germany. The Young Turks needed to modernize the Empire's communications and transportation networks without putting themselves in the hands of European bankers. Europeans already owned much of the country's railroad system, and since 1881, the administration of the defaulted Ottoman foreign debt had been in European hands. During the War, the Young Turk empire was \\"virtually an economic colony on the verge of total collapse.\\" At the end of the War, with the collapse of Bulgaria and Germany's capitulation, Talaat Pasha and the CUP ministry resigned on October 13, 1918, and the Armistice of Mudros was signed aboard a British battleship in the Aegean Sea.. On November 2, Enver, Talaat and Djemal, along with their German allies, fled from Istanbul into exile. 1915‚Äì1918: Armenian Genocide The Armenian Genocide was the Young Turk government's systematic extermination of its Armenian subjects. The conflicts at the Caucasus Campaign, the Persian Campaign, and the Gallipoli Campaign affected places where Armenians lived in significant numbers. Before the declaration of war at the Armenian congress at Erzurum, the Ottoman government asked Ottoman Armenians to facilitate the conquest of Transcaucasia by inciting a rebellion among the Russian Armenians against the tsarist army in the event of a Caucasian Front. Jakob K√ºnzler, head of a missionary hospital in Urfa, documented the large scale ethnic cleansing of both Armenians and Kurds under the Three Pashas during World War I. He gave a detailed account of deportation of Armenians from Erzurum and Bitlis in the winter of 1916. The Armenians were perceived to be subversive elements (a fifth column) that would take the Russian side in the war. In order to eliminate this threat, the Ottoman government embarked on a large scale deportation of Armenians from the regions of Djabachdjur, Palu, Musch, Erzurum, and Bitlis. Around 300,000 Armenians were forced to move southwards to Urfa and then westwards to Aintab and Marash. In the summer of 1917, Armenians were moved to the Konya region in central Anatolia. Through these measures, the CUP leaders aimed to eliminate the Armenian threat by deporting them from their ancestral lands and by dispersing them in small pockets of exiled communities. By the end of World War I, up to 1,200,000 Armenians were forcibly deported from their home vilayets. As a result, about half of the displaced died of exposure, hunger, and disease, or were victims of banditry and forced labor. Around this period, the CUP's relationship to the Armenian Genocide shifted. Early on, Armenians had perceived the CUP as allies; and the beginnings of the Genocide, in the 1909 Adana massacre, had been rooted in reactionary Ottoman backlash against the Young Turks. But during World War I, the CUP's increasing nationalism began to lead them to participate in the genocide. In 2005, the International Association of Genocide Scholars affirmed that scholarly evidence revealed the CUP \\"government of the Ottoman Empire began a systematic genocide of its Armenian citizens and unarmed Christian minority population. More than a million Armenians were exterminated through direct killing, starvation, torture, and forced death marches.\\" Ideology =Materialism and positivism= Another guiding principle for the Young Turks was the transformation of their society into one in which religion played no consequential role, a stark contrast from the theocracy that had ruled the Ottoman Empire since its inception. However, the Young Turks soon recognized the difficulty of spreading this idea among the deeply religious Ottoman peasantry and even much of the elite. The Young Turks thus began suggesting that Islam itself was materialistic. As compared with later efforts by Muslim intellectuals, such as the attempt to reconcile Islam and socialism, this was an extremely difficult endeavor. Although some former members of the CUP continued to make efforts in this field after the revolution of 1908, they were severely denounced by the Ulema, who accused them of \\"trying to change Islam into another form and create a new religion while calling it Islam\\". Positivism, with its claim of being a religion of science, deeply impressed the Young Turks, who believed it could be more easily reconciled with Islam than could popular materialistic theories. The name of the society, Committee of Union and Progress, is believed to be inspired by leading positivist Auguste Comte's motto Order and Progress. Positivism also served as a base for the desired strong government. =Centralized government= After the Committee of Union and Progress grabbed power in the 1913 coup, it embarked on a series of reforms in order to increase centralization in the Empire, an effort that had been ongoing since the last century's Tanzimat reforms under sultan Mahmud II. Many of the original Young Turks rejected this idea, especially those that had formed the Freedom and Accord Party against the CUP. Other opposition parties against the CUP like Prince Sabahaddin‚Äôs and the Arab Ottoman Party for Administrative Decentralization, both of which made opposition to the CUP‚Äôs centralization their main agenda. =Nationalism= In regards to nationalism, the Young Turks underwent a gradual transformation. Beginning with the Tanzimat with ethnically non-Turkish members participating at the outset, the Young Turks embraced the official state ideology: Ottomanism. However, Ottoman patriotism failed to strike root during the First Constitutional Era and the following years. Many ethnically non-Turkish Ottoman intellectuals rejected the idea because of its exclusive use of Turkish symbols. Turkish nationalists gradually gained the upper hand in politics, and following the 1902 Congress, a stronger focus on nationalism developed. It was at this time that Ahmed Rƒ±za chose to replace the term \\"Ottoman\\" with \\"Turk,\\" shifting the focus from Ottoman nationalism to Turkish nationalism. Prominent Young Turks The prominent leaders and ideologists included: * Pamphleteers and activists ** Yusuf Ak√ßura, a Tatar journalist with a secular national ideology, who was against Ottomanism and supported separation of church and state ** Ayetullah Bey ** Osman Hamdi Bey, an Ottoman-Greek painter and owner of the first specialized art school in Istanbul (founded 1883) ** Emmanuel Carasso Efendi, a lawyer and a member of the prominent Sephardic Jewish Carasso family ** Mehmet Cavit Bey, a D√∂nmeh from Thessalonica, Jewish by ancestry but Muslim by religion since the 17th century, who was Minister of Finance;Lord Kinross, The Ottoman Centuries he was hanged for treason in 1926 ** Abdullah Cevdet, a supporter of biological materialism and secularism ** Marcel Samuel Raphael Cohen (aka Tekin Alp), born to a Jewish family in Salonica under Ottoman control (now Thessaloniki, Greece), became one of the founding fathers of Turkish nationalism and an ideologue of Pan-Turkism ** Agah Efendi, founded the first Turkish newspaper and, as postmaster, brought the postage stamp to the Ottoman Empire ** Ziya G√∂kalp, a Turkish nationalist from Diyarbakir, publicist and pioneer sociologist, influenced by modern Western European culture ** Talaat Pasha, whose role before the revolution is not clear ** Ahmed Riza, worked to improve the condition of the Ottoman peasantry; he served as agricultural minister, and later as education minister * Military officers ** Ahmed Niyazi Bey, initiator and a leader of the Young Turk Revolution ** Enver Pasha, a leader of the Young Turk Revolution and later prominent Young Turk politician ** Ey√ºp Sabri, a leader of the Young Turk Revolution ** Bekir Fikri, a prominent participant in the Young Turk Revolution ** Atƒ±f Kam√ßƒ±l, a prominent participant in the Young Turk Revolution ** Subhi Bey Abaza (lived in Sidon) ** Resat Bey Aftermath and legacy The founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, is quoted on the front page of the 1 August 1926 The Los Angeles Examiner as denouncing the Young Turks and especially the CUP (the \\"Young Turk Party\\"): As to the fate of the Three Pashas, two of them, Talaat Pasha and Djemal Pasha, were assassinated by Armenian nationals shortly after the end of World War I while in exile in Europe during Operation Nemesis, a revenge operation against perpetrators of the Armenian Genocide. Soghomon Tehlirian, whose family was killed in the Armenian Genocide, assassinated the exiled Talaat Pasha in Berlin and was subsequently acquitted by a German jury. Djemal Pasha was similarly killed by Stepan Dzaghikian, Bedros Der Boghosian, and Ardashes Kevorkian for \\"crimes against humanity\\" in Tbilisi, Georgia. The third pasha, Enver Pasha, was killed in fighting against the Red Army unit under the command of Hakob Melkumian near Baldzhuan in Tajikistan (then Turkistan).

The film has an emphasis on graffiti, although bboying and rapping are covered to a lesser extent. The film was originally aired on PBS television on January 18th, 1984, and was subsequently shown in several film festivals to much acclaim, including the Vancouver Film Festival. It also won the Grand Jury Prize: Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival. The documentary captures and includes many historical moments of hip hop culture during its earliest days in the 1970s onward towards the early 1980s. MUBI Background The documentary shows both the young artists struggling to express themselves through their art, and their points of view on the subject of graffiti, as well as the views of then New York City Mayor Ed Koch, one- armed, now deceased graffiti writer Case/Kase 2, graffiti writer Skeme and his mother, graffiti \\"villain\\" Cap, now deceased graffiti writer Dondi, Seen and Shy 147, graffiti documentarian (and co-producer of the film) Henry Chalfant, breakdancer Crazy Legs of Rock Steady Crew, police officers, art critics, subway maintenance workers, as well as several \\"people on the street\\". While Style Wars promoted the idea that graffiti is a form of creative expression, not every person within the film held this same belief. In fact, throughout the film we see ways in which institutions such as the government and law enforcement tried arduously to prevent graffiti in New York City. For example, the city spent a large sum of money on negative subway advertisements that portrayed graffiti as a crime. On top of this, the mayor (who at the time was Ed Koch) pushed for the building of fences, with the intent of blocking off the entrances to subways, where graffiti artists would create their work. Additionally, he had police guard dogs put into these areas to scare away those who may enter. Both Koch and The New York City Police Department rallied endlessly at an attempt to convince the city‚Äôs youth that graffiti is vandalism and that if they participated in it they would ruin their futures. Another perspective on graffiti shown in this film is that of well known artists. Many of them state that the reason why these teens spray paint murals on the sides of buildings is because they do not have any other place to do so, not because they want to intentionally break the law. Additionally, these individuals see potential for those that are involved in the culture beyond the streets. In the same way, they appreciate the art while simultaneously disagreeing with exactly how they do it. This in a way makes them middlemen within this documentary. Reception In 2009, A. O. Scott of The New York Times examined the film: \\"Style Wars is a work of art in its own right too, because it doesn't just record what these artists are doing, it somehow absorbs their spirit and manages to communicate it across the decades so that we can find ourselves, so many years later, in the city, understanding what made it beautiful.\\" A 2018 review from The New Yorker also recommends the film, citing its soundtrack and its ability to capture the historical moment it centers on.

It consists of three geological islands: Miquelon, Langlade and Le Cap, connected with tombolos. The communal seat is the settlement of Miquelon, on the northern tip, where the entire island's permanent population of 591 (as of 2017) is located. Miquelon Airport provides flights to Montreal and to nearby Saint-Pierre. Geography Rocky shore of Miquelon Northern coast of Miquelon Island Located in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, west of Newfoundland's Burin Peninsula, Miquelon-Langlade covers a total land area of . It is made up of three geologically distinct islands bound together by tombolos ‚Äî long strips of sand dune ‚Äî Le Cap in the north, Miquelon (Grand Miquelon) in the centre and Langlade (Petite Miquelon) in the south. On the south of the Miquelon Island is a large lagoon known as the Grand Barachois which is host to a large population of seals and other wildlife. Miquelon is also a well known destination for bird watching. An long tombolo sandspit called La Dune connects Miquelon and Langlade.Transport Miquelonnais In the eighteenth century it was still possible to sail a boat between Miquelon and Langlade, but by the end of that century La Dune had closed in to form an isthmus between the islands. Located at west of Saint Pierre Island, Langlade is an ancient peneplain drained by numerous short rivers, including the Belle, the largest, which flows to the northwest.Saint Pierre & Miquelon. Territorial Collectivity of France, in the North America The coast of Langlade is lined with steep cliffs, except to the northwest. Climate K√∂ppen‚ÄìGeiger climate classification system classifies its climate as subarctic (Dfc). Summers are mild while winters are cold. It receives precipitation all year. History The village of Miquelon c. 1930 The name Miquelon is of Basque origin and means \\"Michael\\", as several fishermen with this name were established in the island. In 1579, the names Micquet√µ, Micquelle appeared for the first time in Martin de Hoyar√ßabal's navigational pilot. The name evolved over time into Miclon, Micklon, and finally Miquelon. Demographics The capital of the commune, Miquelon, is located on the north, along a tombolo that connects the formerly separate island of Le Cap with the northwestern part of Miquelon Island. It lies north of a barachois and has constructed a small harbour protected with breakwaters along the eastern side of the isthmus. Miquelon is home to the Miquelon Airport. The Centre M√©dical de Miquelon has some medical care facilities for residents, but other facilities are available on Saint Pierre Island as well as in St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador. The population of Miquelon-Langlade is mainly of Basque and Acadian ancestry. The municipal population of Miquelon-Langlade was 591 in 2017. Transportation Miquelon can be reached by boat or by plane from Saint-Pierre and is served by Miquelon Airport which is located adjacent to the settlement of Miquelon. The airport is served by Air Saint-Pierre with flights both to Saint Pierre Airport and Canada. Education There is a school facility on the island, Ecole du socle de Miquelon. It houses the private contracted nursery school / preschool Soeur Hilarion, the public elementary school Les Quatre Temps, and the public junior high school Coll√®ge de Miquelon.\\"Ecole du socle de Miquelon.\\" National Education Service of Saint Pierre and Miquelon.

Originally built to develop the Lake Timiskaming and Lake Nipissing areas, the railway soon became a major factor in the economic growth of the province. After decades of difficult construction through the Canadian Shield, workers reached James Bay in 1932. While blasting the route through the shield, geologists discovered deposits of valuable minerals such as gold, silver, copper and nickel. The railway also made it possible to exploit the timber resources of Northern Ontario. Its north‚Äìsouth mainline is located entirely in Ontario, starting at its southern terminus at North Bay, running northward through Cobalt, New Liskeard, Cochrane, and on to its northern terminus at Moosonee, several miles south of the shore of James Bay. There is one major branchline running eastward from Swastika through Kirkland Lake and over the Quebec border to end at Rouyn-Noranda. The railway's branch from Swastika to Rouyn-Noranda, including 40 kilometres of track in Quebec, is operated by a subsidiary, the Nipissing Central Railway.Canadian Transportation Agency, Decision No. 448-R-1997 Shorter spur lines also exist running west from Rock Junction to Sherman Mine, south-west from Porquis Junction to Kidd Creek Mine, about 22 km east of Timmins, north-east from Porquis to Iroquois Falls and south from Opaz Junction to Agrium mine site. Several other mining spurs opened and closed with the mines they served. Since 1993, the ON operates a section of the National Transcontinental Railway running west from Cochrane to Calstock. History Porcupine Express, Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway, c. 1910 =James Bay Railway= The line was originally chartered as the Lake Nipissing And James Bay Railway in 1884. The original route ran northward from Callander, roughly northward to Moose River on James Bay. However, in 1902, before construction started, the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) took over the charter and used it as the basis for a new line running northwest from Parry Sound to Sudbury, with an additional line running from Parry Sound south to Toronto. The northern section was completed in 1908, although by this time it had been rechartered as part of the Canadian Northern Ontario Railway (CNOR). The section running south to Toronto had been opened on November 6, 1906. =1902‚Äì46= With the original plans having been dropped, and a railway on this route still desired, the new Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway was incorporated on 17 March 1902, by the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway Act of the Ontario parliament. The railway was to be a provincial Crown corporation overseen by the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway Commission. Construction on the railway started in 1903, and the settlement of Redwater in the municipality of Temagami began as a small request stop when the railway reached the area of the Lower and Upper Redwater Lakes. As it passed by Long Lake, near the 103 mile marker, the largest silver rush in Canada was sparked by workers looking for trees for railway ties. The town of Cobalt grew out of the fortunes of silver taken from the grounds. By 1905, it reached New Liskeard in the Lake Timiskaming area. The railway reached Englehart in 1906 and Cochrane in 1909. In the next few years, several branch lines were built. In 1921, construction on a line north to James Bay was started. In 1923, the new Conservative premier of Ontario, Howard Ferguson, halted further construction, saying that it would be unprofitable. For four years the terminus of the line remained at Fraserdale, near Abitibi Canyon, where the Abitibi Canyon Generating Station was being built on the Abitibi River. Between 1928 and 1930 the railway was extended north at a slow pace. The pace of construction was quickened in 1930 as a make-work project due to the depression. The extension to James Bay was opened on July 15, 1932. The terminus of the railway was at the mouth of the Moose River near the old trading post of Revillon Fr√®res. It was named Moosonee, from the Cree meaning \\"at the moose\\". Ontario Northland freight trains in 1965 A name change for the railway was first proposed in 1942 by Arthur Cavanagh, who was chairman of the commission between 1940 and 1944. He noted that it would have the advantage of associating the railway with the province, not just the District of Timiskaming. A name change would also avoid confusion with the Texas and New Orleans Railway, which had the same initials. The Ontario railway often had boxcars misdirected in the United States, while receiving invoices that should have gone to Texas. The railway's name was changed to the Ontario Northland Railway on April 5, 1946, when a bill amending the Temiskaming and Northern Ontario Railway Act received assent. =1946‚Äì2010= GMD FP7 #1501 at the Mimico Shops in 1968. Three new mines were opened in Northern Ontario in the 1960s. Sherman Mine in Temagami was opened in 1968, Adams Mine in Kirkland Lake in 1963, and Kidd Creek Mine in Timmins in 1967. The Ontario Northland Railway built spurs to serve these mines. In 1993, CN applied to abandon sections of its underused former National Transcontinental Railway mainline across northern Ontario (it had previously abandoned the portion of the line between Calstock and Nakina in 1988). The portion between Calstock and Cochrane was sold to ONR. In December 2000, the Ontario government announced that it would be privatizing the railway. CN submitted a bid in March 2002, and in October the government gave it exclusive rights to negotiate a purchase of the railway. However, the deal fell through on July 2, 2003, over the government's insistence on job guarantees, and the railway remains in public hands. On February 25, 2005, CN and ONR signed a routing agreement in which ONR would transport CN's freight traffic between Noranda and either Hearst or North Bay. On April 14, 2010, there was news of a proposed Ontario Northland takeover of the controversial Ottawa Valley rail tracks. However, this development never came to fruition. =2012: Divestment= On March 23, 2012, the Ontario government announced that it would begin to wind down the ONTC, citing increased costs to the government and stagnant ridership. ONR passenger train service between Toronto and Cochrane (the Northlander) was withdrawn and replaced with an augmented bus service, and all of the corporation's assets were to be sold off.Message from ONTC Chair Ted Hargreaves, March 23, 2012 On August 16, the Ontario Government announced that Northlander train service will end on September 28, 2012, and Ontera will be sold off. =2014: Restructuring= Hearst in 2013 Northern Ontario municipal leaders had continued to express their fears regarding the divestment. They indicated that the ONR provides a fundamental link to many remote and rural communities and provides freight transport to many companies, including mining and forestry, allowing them to thrive. They indicate that the government maintained its funding to the GO Transit network in Southern Ontario and it is important to not forget about the important service the ONR provides to Northern Ontario residents. February 2014, the new premier of Ontario Kathleen Wynne met with northern community leaders and the head of the company and union to discuss the future of the company. They decided the union and management would present a reconstruction plan to the government for consideration. In late February 2014 a report to restructure the ONTC was delivered to the Minister of Northern Development and Mines. The proposal detailed how the organization could be modernized both culturally and in job reductions through attrition. The report was well received by the minister who appreciated how management and labour come together to explore options for the corporation. In April 2014 the provincial government concluded the company would remain in public hands. However, Ontera (its telecommunication division) would be sold off to Bell Aliant. The government would reinvest in the company to purchase new coaches and refurbish rolling stock for the Polar Bear Express. This decision was supported by other members of Provincial Parliament after the auditor general's review cited that it would have cost the taxpayer $820 million instead of saving $265.9 million over three years had the divestment proceeded. Passenger trains ONR operated the following passenger services: * the Northlander from Cochrane to Toronto, 6 days per week, year-round. The Ontario Liberal Government announced plans to discontinue the Northlander and replace it with bus service. The final train ran on September 28, 2012. * the Polar Bear Express from Cochrane to Moosonee, 5 days per week, year-round, and 6 days per week in the summer. This is a flag stop train. The Ontario government has stated its intention to preserve this service even as the ONTC winds down, saying that it will \\"develop ... a new model to provide ongoing support for essential transportation services, such as the Polar Bear Express.\\" * the Dream Catcher Express from North Bay to Temagami, an early fall excursion service. This service ended in 2012. In June 2007 the Polar Bear Express was expanded from a seasonal excursion service to a year-round passenger train, replacing the Little Bear mixed freight/passenger train, which had operated 3 days per week. The new train carries some equipment not commonly found on passenger trains, including chain cars (flat cars) for passenger vehicles and boxcars. Freight services Connections with other railway systems are made as follows: * North Bay (CN and Ottawa Valley Railway, which connects to CP) * Hearst (Algoma Central Railway (subsidiary of CN's eastern operations)) * Rouyn-Noranda (CN) There are a series of regular runs including: *North Bay to Cochrane ‚Äì Weekdays *North Bay to Timmins (Hallnor) ‚Äì Weekdays *North Bay to Rouyn, QC ‚Äì Daily (except Saturday) *Cochrane to Hearst ‚Äì Weekdays *Cochrane to Moosonee ‚Äì Tuesday and Friday *Hearst to Agrium Mine Site ‚Äì DailyTechnical Information Locomotives and rolling stock ex-ONR TEE set used by Northlander now relocated to Zwolle in the Netherlands Trestle over Blanche River north of Englehart The railway currently owns about 25 diesel locomotives and roughly 700 items of rolling stock. One of its more unusual pieces of rolling stock is a canoe car, which is in service in the summer as part of the Polar Bear Express passenger train. The car can hold up to 18 canoes. Canoeists can put canoes on this car as part of their baggage, although canoes are often stowed in boxcars. It is the only known train car specifically designed for transporting canoes and kayaks. In 1977, the railway purchased four RAm/DE train sets retired from the Trans Europ Express by the Dutch and Swiss railways, for use on its Northlander train. However, the experiment was not entirely successful. The locomotives were scrapped in 1984, although the passenger cars survived until the early 1990s. These surviving passenger cars were pulled by rebuilt Canadian locomotives (EMD FP7). The rear end of the locomotives was altered to fit to original cars. With the Canadian locomotives, the control car / DVT lost their function. Many passenger cars used on ONR trains today are former single-level GO Transit cars that were extensively refurbished after being used for commuter service around Toronto. In 2004, Ontario Northland purchased ten passenger cars, including dome cars, from BC Rail and has used some of them on the Polar Bear Express service between Cochrane and Moosonee. * Highball steam engine ‚Äì ex-Temiskaming & Northern Ontario (later as 219) built in 1907 and Normetal 1938, then acquired by ONR in 1975 and sold to Northern Ontario Railway Museum * 4-6-2 steam engine () ‚Äì stored in Englehart * Electro-Motive Diesel (EMD) F7B * General Motors Diesel (GMD) FP7 * GMD GP9 * GMD GP38-2 * GMD GP40-2 * GMD SD40-2 * GMD SD75I ; Montreal Locomotive Works * MLW RS-10 * MLW RS-2 * MLW RS-3 * MLW S-4 * MLW S-2 * American Locomotive Company (Alco) RS-2 * Hawker Siddeley Canada corrugated coach ‚Äì single deck coach acquired from GO Transit * PM-class coach * Budd dome coach * Budd lounge car * Budd lunch counter car * Werkspoor/Schweizerische Industrie Gesellschaft TEE Trainset (No longer on roster, some cars have been shipped back to Europe, currently based in the Netherlands) Facilities Ontario Northland building in North Bay * North Bay Yard ‚Äì located on the west side of the ONR Head Office and stores most of the ONR's cars.

It produces and distributes trading cards, anime, tokusatsu, slot machines, pachinko machines, and arcade cabinets, and is a video game developer and publisher. Konami has casinos around the world and operates health and physical fitness clubs across Japan. Konami's video game franchises include Metal Gear, Silent Hill, Castlevania, Contra, Frogger, Gradius, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Suikoden, and Pro Evolution Soccer. Additionally, Konami owns Bemani, known for Dance Dance Revolution and Beatmania, as well as the assets of former game developer Hudson Soft, known for Bomberman, Adventure Island, Bonk, Bloody Roar, and Star Soldier. Konami is the twentieth-largest game company in the world by revenue. The company originated in 1969 as a jukebox rental and repair business in Toyonaka, Osaka, Japan, by Kagemasa K≈çzuki, who remains the company's chairman. The name Konami is a portmanteau of the names Kagemasa Kozuki, Yoshinobu Nakama, and Tatsuo Miyasako. Konami is headquartered in Tokyo. In the United States, Konami manages its video game business from offices in El Segundo, California and its casino gaming business from offices in Paradise, Nevada. Its Australian gaming operations are located in Sydney. As of March 2019, it owns 22 consolidated subsidiaries around the world. History The Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game is developed and published by Konami. In 2011, Guinness World Records called it the top-selling trading card game in history, with cards sold worldwide. The company was founded on March 21, 1969, and was officially incorporated under the name on March 19, 1973. The company's founder and chairman, Kagemasa Kozuki, ran a jukebox rental and repair business in Toyonaka, Osaka before transforming the business into a manufacturer of amusement machines for video arcades. Their first coin- operated video game was released in 1978, and they began exporting products to the United States the following year. Konami began to achieve success with hit arcade games such as 1981's Frogger, Scramble, and Super Cobra, many of which were licensed to other companies for stateside release, including Stern Electronics and Gremlin Industries. They eventually established their U.S. subsidiary, Konami of America, Inc. in 1982. It was during this period that Konami began expanding their video game business into the home consumer market following a brief stint releasing video games for the Atari 2600 in 1982 for the U.S. market. The company would release numerous games for the MSX home computer standard in 1983, followed by the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1985. Numerous Konami franchises were established during this period on both platforms, as well as the arcades, such as Gradius, Castlevania, Twin Bee, Ganbare Goemon, Contra and Metal Gear. Due to the success of their NES games, Konami's earnings grew from $10 million in 1987 to $300 million in 1991. In June 1991, Konami's legal name was changed to and their headquarters would later be relocated to Minato, Tokyo in April 1993. The company started supporting the 16-bit video game consoles during this period, starting with the Super NES in 1990, followed by the PC Engine in 1991 and the Sega Genesis in 1992. After the launch of the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in 1994, Konami became a business divisional organization with the formation of various Konami Computer Entertainment (KCE) subsidiaries, starting with KCE Tokyo and KCE Osaka (which would be later known as KCE Studios) in April 1995, followed by KCE Japan (later known as Kojima Productions) in April 1996. Each KCE subsidiary would end up creating different intellectual properties such as KCE Tokyo's Silent Hill series and KCE Japan's Metal Gear Solid series (a revival of the Metal Gear series on MSX). In 1997, Konami started producing rhythm games for arcades under the Bemani brand and branched off into the collectible card game business with the launch of the Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game. In July 2000, the company's legal English name was changed to Konami Corporation, but the Japanese legal name remained the same. As the company transitioned into the developing video games for the sixth-generation consoles, they branched out into the health and fitness business with the acquisitions of People Co., Ltd and Daiei Olympic Sports Club, Inc., which became Konami subsidiaries. In August 2001, the company invested in another video game publisher, Hudson Soft, which became a consolidated subsidiary after Konami accepted new third- party shares issued by them. In March 2006, Konami merged all their video game development divisions into a new subsidiary known as Konami Digital Entertainment Co. (KDE), as the parent company became a pure holding company. Their headquarters were relocated to Minato, Tokyo, in 2007. The absorption of Hudson Soft in 2012 resulted in the addition of several other franchises including: Adventure Island, Bonk, Bloody Roar, Bomberman, Far East of Eden and Star Soldier. In April 2015, Konami delisted itself from the New York Stock Exchange following the dissolution of their Kojima Productions subsidiary. In a translated interview with Nikkei Trendy Net published in the following month, the newly appointed CEO of Konami Digital Entertainment, Hideki Hayakawa, announced that Konami would shift their focus towards mobile gaming for a while, claiming that \\"mobile is where the future of gaming lies.\\" The trade name of the company was changed from Konami Corporation to Konami Holdings Corporation during the same month. In 2017, Konami announced that they would be reviving some of the company's other well-known video game titles following the success of their Nintendo Switch launch title Super Bomberman R. In early 2020, Konami moved their headquarters to the Ginza district of Tokyo, which includes a facility for holding esports events as well as a school for esports players.

Video games A Dance Dance Revolution arcade machine. Major titles by Konami include the action Castlevania series, the survival horror Silent Hill series, the action shooter Contra series, the platform adventure Ganbare Goemon series, the stealth action Metal Gear series, the role-playing Suikoden series, the Bemani rhythm game series (which includes Dance Dance Revolution, Beatmania IIDX, GuitarFreaks, DrumMania, and Pop'n Music, among others), Dancing with the Stars, the dating simulation Tokimeki Memorial series, and football simulation Pro Evolution Soccer. Konami produced its shoot 'em up arcade games such as Gradius, Life Force, Time Pilot, Gyruss, Parodius, Axelay, and TwinBee. Konami's games based on cartoon licenses, especially the Batman: The Animated Series, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Tiny Toon Adventures and Animaniacs series, but other American productions like The Simpsons, Bucky O'Hare, G.I. Joe, X-Men and The Goonies and French comic Asterix all have seen release at some point in the past by Konami either on arcades and/or video game consoles. Some cinematically styled franchises from Konami are Silent Hill survival horror franchise, and the Metal Gear series. Another successful franchise is Winning Eleven, the spiritual sequel to International Superstar Soccer. In Japan, it is known for the popular Jikky≈ç Powerful Pro Yaky≈´ series baseball series and the Zone of the Enders games. The company has picked up Saw from Brash Entertainment when the game's production had been suspended due to financial issues. Konami is known for its password, the Konami Code, which traditionally gives many power-ups in its games. Film production In 2006, Konami started producing films based on their franchises. Konami produced the Silent Hill film (released in 2006) and announced that they will produce a Metal Gear Solid film.  Personal computing  In 2020, Konami launched a PC gaming brand in Japan known as Arespear, which includes desktop computers, keyboards, and headsets (the last of which designed in collaboration with Konami's Bemani musicians). Controversies =Silent Hills and reduced video game development= Silent Hills, set to be the ninth installment of the Silent Hill franchise, was abruptly cancelled in April 2015 without explanation despite the critical acclaim and success of P.T., a playable teaser. Hours after the announcement, Konami delisted itself from the New York Stock Exchange. Game co-director and writer Guillermo del Toro publicly criticized the cancellation as not making any sense and questioned what he described as a \\"scorched earth\\" approach to removing the trailer. Due to the experience, del Toro stated that he would never work on another video game.Kuchera, Ben. Guillermo del Toro has a simple message: ‚ÄòFuck Konami‚Äô. Polygon. Retrieved on May 10, 2018.

Konami: 'Our Commitment To AAA Console Games Has Never Changed'. Retrieved on February 9, 2018 =Kojima Productions= On March 3, 2015, Konami announced they would be shifting focus away from individual studios, notably Kojima Productions. Internal sources claimed the restructure was due to a clash between Hideo Kojima and Konami. References to Kojima were soon stripped from marketing material, and Kojima's position as an executive vice president of Konami Digital Entertainment was removed from the company's official listing of executives. Later that year, Konami's legal department barred Kojima from accepting the award for Best Action-Adventure for his work on Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain at The Game Awards 2015. When announced during the event, the audience booed in disapproval of Konami's actions. Host Geoff Keighley expressed his disappointment in Konami's actions. After actor Kiefer Sutherland accepted the award in Kojima's stead, a choir sang \\"Quiet's Theme\\" from The Phantom Pain as a tribute to the absent Kojima. Kojima left Konami several days afterwards, re-opening Kojima Productions as an independent company. =Treatment of employees and ex-employees= In August 2015, The Nikkei criticized Konami for its unethical treatment of employees. In June 2017, The Nikkei further reported of Konami's continued clashes with Kojima Productions, preventing the studio's application for health insurance, as well as Konami's actions in making it difficult for former employees to get future jobs; they are notably forbidden to mention their work in Konami on their r√©sum√©s. Konami also started filing complaints against other game companies that would hire ex-Konami employees, leading to an unspecified major game company warning its staff against doing so. A former employee of Konami stated: \\"If an ex-[Konami employee] is interviewed by the media, the company will send that person a letter through a legal representative, in some cases indicating that Konami is willing to take them to court\\"; they also pressured an ex-employee into closing their new business.

A pardon may be granted before or after conviction for the crime, depending on the laws of the jurisdiction. Pardons can be granted in many countries when individuals are deemed to have demonstrated that they have \\"paid their debt to society\\", or are otherwise considered to be deserving of them. Pardons are sometimes offered to persons who were either wrongfully convicted or who claim that they were wrongfully convicted. In some jurisdictions of some nations, accepting a pardon may implicitly constitute an admission of guilt; the offer is refused in some cases. Cases of wrongful conviction are in recent times more often dealt with by appeal rather than by pardon; however, a pardon is sometimes offered when innocence is undisputed in order to avoid the costs that are associated with a retrial. Clemency plays a critical role when capital punishment is applied. Pardons are sometimes seen as a mechanism for combating corruption, allowing a particular authority to circumvent a flawed judicial process to free someone that is seen as wrongly convicted. Pardons can also be a source of controversy. In extreme cases, some pardons may be seen as acts of corruption by officials in the form of granting effective immunity as political favors. By country =Australia= In Australia, the traditional pardon power is referred to as the royal prerogative of mercy, an executive power that is vested in the Queen and may be exercised by the Governor- General. The prerogative of mercy is a broad discretionary power that may be exercised by a state governor who is acting on the advice of the state executive council and the state attorney general. Courts in Australia may also exercise their traditional power to exercise mercy when the circumstances of the defendant or offense warrant relief. In addition to the prerogative of mercy, Australia has passed legislation that creates additional avenues to seek a pardon, exoneration, reduced sentence, or conditional release. =Canada= Pardons The Parole Board of Canada (PBC) is the federal agency responsible for making pardon decisions under the Criminal Records Act (CRA). Under the CRA, the PBC can issue, grant, deny, and revoke pardons. In 2012, the Parliament of Canada passed the Safe Streets and Communities Act, which changed many of elements regarding the criminal justice system. The Act replaced the term \\"pardon\\" with \\"record suspension\\", and the pardon system was similarly changed. A pardon keeps the police record of a conviction separate and apart from other criminal records, and gives law-abiding citizens an opportunity to reintegrate into Canadian society. The RCMP removes all information about the conviction for which an individual received the pardon from the Canadian Police Information Centre (CPIC). Federal agencies cannot give out information about the conviction without approval from the Minister of Public Safety Canada. A pardon does not, however, erase the fact that an individual was convicted of a crime. The criminal record is not erased, but it is kept separate and apart from other (non-pardoned) criminal records. A pardon removes disqualifications caused by a criminal conviction, such as the ability to contract with the federal government, or eligibility for Canadian citizenship. If an individual in receipt of a pardon is convicted of a new offence, the information may lead to a reactivation of the criminal record for which the pardon was received in CPIC. A pardon does not guarantee entry or visa privileges to another country. Before travelling to another country, individuals must still contact the authorities of the country in question to find out what the requirements are to enter that country. Processing of pardons by the Parole Board of Canada generally takes six months for a summary offence and twelve months for an indictable offence. If the Parole Board proposes to deny the application, it can take 24 months to process. Retrieved on June 30, 2016 Individuals can apply for a pardon if they were convicted as an adult of a criminal offense in Canada, or of an offense under a federal act or regulation of Canada, or if they were convicted of a crime in another country and were transferred to Canada under the Transfer of Offenders Act or International Transfer of Offenders Act. Non-Canadian citizens are not eligible for a Canadian pardon unless they were convicted of a crime in Canada. To be eligible for a pardon or record suspension, individuals must have completed all of their sentences and a waiting period. Individuals are considered to have completed all of their sentences if they have: * Paid all fines, surcharges, costs, restitution and compensation orders * Served all sentences of imprisonment, conditional sentences, including parole or statutory release * Completed their probation order Prior to 2012, following completion of all of their sentences, individuals must have completed a waiting period, as follows: * Three years for summary convictions under the Criminal Code or other federal act or regulation, except sexual crimes against children * Three years under the National Defence Act, if fined $2,000 or less, detained or imprisoned six months or less, or subjected to various lesser punishments for a service offence * Five years for indictable convictions under the Criminal Code or other federal act or regulation and summary convictions of sexual crimes against children * Five years for all convictions by a Canadian offender transferred to Canada under the Transfer of Offenders Act or International Transfer of Offenders Act * Five years under the National Defence Act, if you were fined more than $2,000, detained or imprisoned more than six months, or dismissed from service * Ten years for indictable convictions for sexual crimes against children and criminals receiving more than two years of imprisonment time for \\"serious personal injury offence\\" such as manslaughter or other designated offence under section 752 of the Criminal Code. Effective 13 March 2012, the eligibility criteria and waiting periods changed: * Five years for summary convictions under the Criminal Code or other federal act or regulation, except sexual crimes against children * Five years under the National Defence Act, if fined $2,000 or less, detained or imprisoned six months or less, or subjected to various lesser punishments for a service offence * Ten years for indictable convictions under the Criminal Code or other federal act or regulation and summary convictions of sexual crimes against children * Ten years for all convictions by a Canadian offender transferred to Canada under the Transfer of Offenders Act or International Transfer of Offenders Act * Ten years under the National Defence Act, if fined more than $2,000, detained or imprisoned more than six months, or dismissed from service * \\"Not Eligible\\" for indictable convictions for sexual crimes against children (Schedule 1 Offence under CRA) * \\"Not Eligible\\" for criminals with more than three offences prosecuted by indictment, each with a prison sentence of two or more years. Applicants for a record suspension must be able to show that they have completed their sentences in full and provide proof of payment. Individuals can apply for a pardon by filling out the application forms available from the Parole Board and by paying a $631 pardon application fee. Clemency In Canada, clemency is granted by the Governor-General of Canada or the Governor in Council (the federal cabinet) under the royal prerogative of mercy. Applications are also made to the National Parole Board, as in pardons, but clemency may involve the commutation of a sentence, or the remission of all or part of the sentence, a respite from the sentence (for a medical condition) or a relief from a prohibition (e.g., to allow someone to drive who has been prohibited from driving). =Chile= In Chile, the institution of pardon (indulto) is regulated in the Criminal Code (article 93, N¬∫ 4¬∫), which deals with the extinction of criminal liability. A pardon \\"only grants the remission or the commutation of the sentence; it does not remove the condition of having been condemned\\". The pardon may be either general, when it is granted to all those covered by a specific law passed by qualified quorum in National Congress, or particular, when it is granted by Supreme Decree of the President of the Republic. In Chile's presidential regime, the President is the Head of State; in this capacity, he or she has the discretionary power to grant particular pardons. He or she is not obliged to seek opinion or approval from other authorities, although, the granting of pardons is limited by the norms of Law No. 18.050 (1981), and its Regulations (Decree No. 1542 of 1981 on particular pardons), which forbid particular pardons for those convicted of a crime of terrorism. =Egypt= On September 23, 2015, Al Jazeera journalists, Canadian Mohamed Fahmy and Egyptian Baher Mohamed, were among 100 activists released from prison after Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi issued a pardon which he announced on his Facebook page. This marks the occasion of Eid al- Adha and the President's visit to the 70th session of the United Nations General Assembly which will take place later this week. The Al Jazeera Media Network has welcomed their release but continues to demand all charges and sentences against its journalists are dropped. =France= Pardons and acts of clemency (gr√¢ces) are granted by the President of France, who, ultimately, is the sole judge of the propriety of the measure. It is a prerogative of the President which is directly inherited from that of the Kings of France. The convicted person sends a request for pardon to the President of the Republic. The prosecutor of the court that pronounced the verdict reports on the case, and the case goes to the Ministry of Justice's directorate of criminal affairs and pardons for further consideration. If granted, the decree of pardon is signed by the President, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Justice, and possibly other ministers involved in the consideration of the case. It is not published in the Journal Officiel. The decree may spare the applicant from serving the balance of his or her sentence, or commute the sentence to a lesser one. It does not suppress the right for the victim of the crime to obtain compensation for the damages it suffered, and does not erase the condemnation from the criminal record. When the death penalty was in force in France, all capital sentences resulted in a presidential review for a possible clemency. Executions were carried out if and only if the President rejected clemency, by signing a document on which it was written: \\"decides to let justice take its course\\". The Parliament of France, on occasions, grants amnesty. This is a different concept and procedure from that described above, although the phrase \\"presidential amnesty\\" (amnistie pr√©sidentielle) is sometimes pejoratively applied to some acts of parliament traditionally voted upon after a presidential election, granting amnesty for minor crimes. =Germany= Similar to the United States, the right to grant pardon in Germany is divided between the federal and the state level. Federal jurisdiction in matters of criminal law is mostly restricted to appeals against decisions of state courts. Only \\"political\\" crimes like treason or terrorism are tried on behalf of the federal government by the highest state courts. Accordingly, the category of persons eligible for a federal pardon is rather narrow. The right to grant a federal pardon lies in the office of the President of Germany, but he or she can transfer this power to other persons, such as the chancellor or the minister of justice. In early 2007, there was a widespread public discussion about the granting of pardons in Germany after convicted Red Army Faction terrorist Christian Klar, who was serving six consecutive sentences of life imprisonment, filed a petition for pardon. President Horst K√∂hler ultimately denied his request. For all other (and therefore the vast majority of) convicts, pardons are in the jurisdiction of the states. In some states it is granted by the respective cabinet, but in most states the state constitution vests the authority in the state prime minister. As on the federal level, the authority may be transferred. Amnesty can be granted only by federal law. =Greece= The Constitution of Greece grants the power of pardon to the President of the Republic (Art. 47, ¬ß 1). He/She can pardon, commute or remit punishment imposed by any court, on the proposal of the Minister of Justice and after receiving the opinion (not the consent necessarily) of the Pardon Committee. =Hong Kong= Prior to the transfer of the sovereignty in 1997, the power of pardon was the royal prerogative of mercy of the monarch of the United Kingdom. This was used and cited the most often in cases of convicts who had been given the death penalty: from 1965 to 1993 (when the death penalty was formally abolished) death sentences were automatically commuted to life imprisonment under the royal prerogative. Since the transfer, the Chief Executive of Hong Kong now exercises the power to grant pardons and commute penalties under section 12 of article 48 Basic Law of Hong Kong. \\"The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall exercise the following powers and functions ... to pardon persons convicted of criminal offences or commute their penalties\\". =India= Under the Constitution of India (Article 72), the President of India can grant a pardon or reduce the sentence of a convicted person, particularly in cases involving capital punishment. A similar and parallel power vests in the governors of each state under Article 161. The Constitution of India vests sovereign power in the president and governors. The governance in the centre and states is carried out in the name of the president and governor respectively. The president is empowered with the power to pardon under Article 72 of the Indian Constitution. Article 72 says that the president shall have the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence. The meaning of these terms is as follows: The pardoning powers of the Indian President are elucidated in Art 72 of the Indian Constitution. There are five different types of pardoning which are mandated by law. # Pardon: means completely absolving the person of the crime and letting him go free. The pardoned criminal will be like a normal citizen. # Commutation: means changing the type of punishment given to the guilty into a less harsh one, for example, a death penalty commuted to a life sentence. # Reprieve: means a delay allowed in the execution of a sentence, usually a death sentence, for a guilty person to allow him some time to apply for Presidential Pardon or some other legal remedy to prove his innocence or successful rehabilitation. # Respite: means reducing the quantum or degree of the punishment to a criminal in view of some special circumstances, like pregnancy, mental condition etc. # Remission: means changing the quantum of the punishment without changing its nature, for example reducing twenty year rigorous imprisonment to ten years. Article 72 reads: Similarly, as per article 161: Governor of a State has the power to grant pardons, reprieves, respites or remissions of punishment or to suspend, remit or commute the sentence of any person convicted of any offence against any law relating to a matter to which the executive power of the state extends. Please note that President can grant pardon to a person awarded death sentence. But a governor of a state does not enjoy this power. The question is whether this power to grant pardon is absolute or this power of pardon shall be exercised by the President on the advice of Council of Ministers. The pardoning power of the president is not absolute. It is governed by the advice of the Council of Ministers. This has not been discussed by the constitution but is the practical truth. Further, the constitution does not provide for any mechanism to question the legality of decisions of President or governors exercising mercy jurisdiction. But the SC in Epuru Sudhakar case has given a small window for judicial review of the pardon powers of President and governors for the purpose of ruling out any arbitrariness. The court has earlier held that court has retained the power of judicial review even on a matter which has been vested by the Constitution solely in the Executive. However, it is important to note that India has a unitary legal system and there is no separate body of state law. All crimes are crimes against the Union of India. Therefore, a convention has developed that the governor's powers are exercised for only minor offenses, while requests for pardons and reprieves for major offenses and offenses committed in the Union Territories are deferred to the President. Both the President and Governor are bound by the advice of their respective Councils of Ministers and hence the exercise of this power is of an executive character. It is therefore subject to Judicial Review as held by the Supreme Court of India in the case of . It was subsequently confirmed by . In the case of , it was held that \\"clemency is subject to judicial review and that it cannot be dispensed as a privilege or act of grace\\". The court made these observation while quashing the decision of then Governor of Andhra Pradesh Sushil Kumar Shinde in commuting the sentence of a convicted Congress activist. =Iran= In the Islamic Republic of Iran, the Supreme Leader has the power to pardon and offer clemency under Article 110, ¬ß 1, ¬ß¬ß 11. =Ireland=  Constitutional basis  The Irish constitution states (in Article 13.6) that The power of clemency is nominally exercised by the president. However, the President of Ireland must act \\"on the advice\\" of the Government (cabinet), so in practice the clemency decisions are made by the government of the day and the president has no discretion in the matter. The responsibility can also be delegated to people or bodies other than the president. Amnesty and immunity, on the other hand, are usually dealt with by an Act of the Oireachtas rather than by a general form of pardon or a slate of individual pardons. There are two methods by which a pardon may proceed: Method I In the first procedure, aimed at miscarriages of justice, the Minister for Justice may recommend to the Government that they formally advise the President to grant a pardon, and any conditions along with it. 1993 Criminal Procedure Act provides the method by which a person convicted of an offense may apply for a pardon. Under this procedure, the person must: * Have already been convicted. * Have used up their appeals. * Allege a new fact (previously known and believed to be significant, but which he has a reasonable excuse for not having mentioned) or newly discovered fact (including a fact previously known which was not believed to be significant) showing a miscarriage of justice has taken place. Then they can apply in writing to the Minister for Justice for a pardon. The minister may then \\"make or cause to be made such inquiries as they consider necessary\\" and may refuse to grant the pardon on his/her own initiative, or if they think the person should be pardoned, bring such argument to cabinet. Method II Section six of the act allows a Minister for Justice to seek or receive a pardon request from someone whose case is not a 'miscarriage of justice', but has some other fault, such as an archaic law, a law being misapplied by a rogue judge, a reduction in the harshness of a sentence or a substitution of a sentence, without having to go through the procedure above, gone through appeals, or presented new facts. It also allows the minister to waive the procedure in a case of miscarriage of justice if the specific case warrants it. It may also allow prospective pardons as it allows the minister to pardon someone who has not been convicted yet, which the other procedure requires. Committee of Inquiry The government itself may assemble a committee to study the case in more detail on their behalf. This may consist of anyone, and any number, but the chair must be: * A judge or former judge or * A barrister of at least 10 years standing or * A solicitor of at least 10 years standing. This special committee may look to any material it sees fit to make its decision, even if it was not, or would not be, available to a jury or trial judge in a normal court. The government do not have to be bound by the committee recommendations. Pardons under Military Law Under Section 7(5) of the act, the same powers of the Minister for Justice apply to the Minister for Defence in the case of military officers and enlisted convicted by courts martial. Compensation The Minister for Justice or Defence may also, in their absolute discretion, pay compensation, determined by them alone, to any person given a pardon, if this compensation is applied for. If they think the compensation is too low they may challenge for a higher figure in the High Court. List of people who have received a presidential pardon since 1938 The power is used very infrequently compared to, for example, pardons in the United States. *1940 ‚Äì Thomas Quinn, granted by Douglas Hyde *1943 ‚Äì Walter Brady, granted by Douglas Hyde *1992 ‚Äì Nicky Kelly, granted by Mary Robinson *1999 ‚Äì William Geary, granted by Mary McAleese =Israel= In Israel the President has the power to pardon criminals or give them clemency. The pardon is given following a recommendation by the Minister of Justice. After the Kav 300 affair, President Chaim Herzog issued a pardon to four members of the Shin Bet prior to them being indicted. This unusual act was the first of its kind in Israel. =Italy= In Italy, the President of the Republic may \\"grant pardons, or commute punishments\\" according to article 87 of the Italian Constitution. Like other acts of the president, the pardon requires the countersignature of the competent government minister. The Constitutional Court of Italy has ruled that the Minister of Justice is obliged to sign acts of pardon. The pardon may remove the punishment altogether or change its form. Unless the decree of pardon states otherwise, the pardon does not remove any incidental effects of a criminal conviction, such as a mention in a certificate of conduct (174 c.p.) or the loss of civil rights. According to article 79 of the Italian Constitution the Parliament may grant amnesty (article 151 c.p.) and pardon (article 174 c.p.) by law deliberated a majority of two-thirds of the components. The last general pardon, discounting 3 years from sentences, was approved in 2006. =Poland= In Poland, the President is granted the right of pardon by Article 139 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland. As of October 2008, 7,819 people were pardoned, while 3,046 people's appeals were declined. *Lech Wa≈Çƒôsa **Approved ‚Äì 3,454 **Declined ‚Äì 384 *Aleksander Kwa≈õniewski **Approved ‚Äì 3,295 (the first term); 795 (the second term); total ‚Äì 4,090 **Declined ‚Äì 993 (the first term); 1,317 (the second term); total ‚Äì 2,310 *Lech Kaczy≈Ñski **Approved ‚Äì 201 **Declined ‚Äì 913 *Bronis≈Çaw Komorowski **Approved ‚Äì 219 **Declined ‚Äì 189 =Portugal= In Portugal, the Heads of State, Kings or Presidents, have always enjoyed the prerogative of grace, being able to grant pardons, commuting or extinguishing sentences in the context of requests for clemency. According to the Portuguese ConstitutionArticle 134.¬∫, paragraph f) of the Constitution of Portugal, the President of the Portuguese Republic has the power to pardon and commute sentences, on the proposal of the Government of the Portuguese Republic. This is the exclusive and discretionary competence of the President and is not subject to any conditions beyond the prior hearing of the Government, generally represented by the Minister of Justice. Requests or proposals for pardons are instructed by the Criminal Execution Court by referral from the Ministry of Justice and subsequently submitted to the President for consideration. The pardon is granted by Presidential Decree; if the pardon is denied, the President decides by order. Traditionally pardons are granted during the Christmas period. The pardon can be revoked by the President of the Republic. In 2019 the President granted two pardons. Presidente da Rep√∫blica concede dois indultos \\"por raz√µes humanit√°rias\\", 2020.02.04 The pardon, as an individual, shall not be confused with amnesty or generic forgiveness, both of a general and abstract nature. Amnesty has retroactive effects, affecting not only the penalty applied but the past criminal act itself, which is forgotten, considered as not practiced (retroactive abolition of crime). Generic forgiveness focuses only on the penalties determined by the sentencing decision and for the future. It is the reserved competence of the Portuguese Parliamnent to approve generic amnesties and pardons.Article 161.¬∫, paragraph f) of the Constitution of Portugal =Russia= The President of the Russian Federation is granted the right of pardon by Article 89 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation. The chain of pardon committees manage lists of people eligible for pardon and directs them to the President for signing. While President Boris Yeltsin frequently used his power of pardon (1998 ‚Äì 7,000 to 8,000 cases), his successor Vladimir Putin is much more hesitant; he granted five pardons in 2014 and two in 2015.–ù–µ –º–∏–ª–æ—Å–µ—Ä–¥–∏–µ, –∞ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è –∏–≥—Ä–∞: –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–º–∏—Ä –ü—É—Ç–∏–Ω –µ–∂–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω–æ –æ—Ç–ø—É—Å–∫–∞–µ—Ç –∏–∑ —Ç—é—Ä–µ–º –≤—Å–µ–≥–æ –ø–∞—Ä—É —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫. –ü–æ—á–µ–º—É?

The prerogative is one of the powers of the president defined by the Constitution of Rwanda, which came into effect in 2003 following a national referendum.Rwanda U.S. Department of State (accessed 2008-10-20) According to the Constitution of Rwanda, \\"The President of the Republic has authority to exercise the prerogative of mercy in accordance with the procedure determined by law and after consulting the Supreme Court on the matter.\\"Constitution of Rwanda Article 111. Legal and Constitutional Commission of Rwanda (accessed 2008-10-20) =Republic of South Africa= Under section 84(2)(j) of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996 (Act 108 of 1996), the President of the Republic of South Africa is responsible for pardoning or reprieving offenders. This power of the President is only exercised in highly exceptional cases. To pardon a person is to forgive a person for his/her deeds. The pardon process is therefore not available to persons who maintain their innocence and is not an advanced form of appeal procedure. Pardon is only granted for minor offences after a period of ten years has elapsed since the relevant conviction. For many serious offences (for example if the relevant court viewed the offence in such a serious light that direct imprisonment was imposed) pardon will not be granted even if more than ten years have elapsed since the conviction. =Spain= The derecho de gracia (\\"right of grace\\") or indulto (\\"pardon\\") is acknowledged by the Spanish Constitution of 1978 as a privilege of the King of Spain (article 62.i: \\"Functions of the King\\"). The Spanish Constitution defines it as a renounce on the State's part of its own punitive power on behalf of an individual, founded on reasons of equity or public interest. The Constitution subjects royal pardons to the Law and forbids general pardons, so they have to be granted individually. Theoretically, a royal pardon can be granted for a general offense or accessory offenses alone; if it is granted for a general offense, the accessory ones it implies are also pardoned, with the exception of punishments involving political rights (i.e., removal of the right to run for a public office as a result of a sentence), which have to be explicitly mentioned in the pardon decree if they are going to be pardoned. The procedure and requirements for the grant of the pardon are given by the Law of 18 June 1870, modified by the Law 1/1988 of 14 January. The application for royal pardon has to be carried out by the convicted person himself, his relatives or any other person in his name. The convicting court will then issue a report of the case, which shall be considered along with the public comments of the Prosecutor and the victims of the crime if there were any. All of this is gathered by the Minister of Justice, who will present the pardon issue to the Cabinet of Ministers. If the Cabinet decides a pardon should be granted, then the Minister of Justice will recommend as such to the King. Pardons are issued by Royal Decree and have to be published in the Bolet√≠n Oficial del Estado (\\"Public Journal\\"). Pardons are not commonly conceded in Spain but for offenders convicted for minor crimes who are about to complete their sentence and have shown good behaviour and repentance. Dating back to medieval times, several organisations and religious brotherhoods still hold the right of granting pardons as part of some privilege or other granted to them by the King of Spain. The scope of this privilege depends on the royal charter received by the organisation when their right to concede pardons was granted, though it usually holds only for minor offenses in very especial conditions; this right is implicitly acknowledged by the public offices nowadays, though it is not exercised but following the usual procedure for royal pardons. Traditionally, they will propose some petty criminal about to end his sentence for pardon being granted to him, and he/she will be released following the tradition to which the pardon holds, usually during the Holy Week. This type of pardons are distinguished from the usual ones in that they only release the prisoner from jail, halting the sentence, but do not pardon the offense itself. =Sri Lanka= In Sri Lanka, under the Sri Lankan Constitution the President can grant a pardon, respite or substitute a less severe form of punishment for any punishment imposed to any offender convicted of any offence in any court within the Republic of Sri Lanka. It is generally referred to as a Presidential pardon. =Switzerland= In Switzerland, pardons may be granted by the Swiss Federal Assembly for crimes prosecuted by the federal authorities. For crimes under cantonal jurisdiction, cantonal law designates the authority competent to grant pardons (if any). In most cantons, the cantonal parliament may pardon felonies, and the cantonal government may pardon misdemeanors and minor infractions. =Turkey= The president of Turkey is granted the right of pardon under certain circumstances defined in the constitution, article 104. According to the article, the president can \\"remit, on grounds of chronic illness, disability, or old age, all or part of the sentences imposed on certain individuals\\". After the convict's or his or her proxy's application, if the Council of Forensic Medicine determines that the convict suffers from chronic illness, disability, or old age, the Ministry of Justice presents the situation to the president, and the president can choose to grant a pardon. Additionally, the parliament of Turkey has the power to announce general amnesty. =United Kingdom= The power to grant pardons and reprieves in the United Kingdom is known as the royal prerogative of mercy. It was traditionally in the absolute power of the monarch to pardon an individual for a crime, whether or not he or she had been convicted, and thereby commute any penalty; the power was then delegated both to the judiciary and the sovereign's ministers. Since the creation of legal rights of appeal, the royal prerogative of mercy is no longer exercised by the person of the sovereign, or by the judiciary, but only by the government. In constitutional terms, under the doctrine of the rule of law, the power of ministers to overrule the judiciary by commuting criminal sanctions imposed resolves different and sometimes conflicting public interests. In civil matters, only the legislative branch, and not ministers, have the power to override the judiciary. Until the nineteenth century, for many crimes the sentence was mandatory and was formally pronounced in court immediately upon conviction, but judges and ministers were given powers to exercise the royal prerogative of mercy out of court, in order to mitigate the rigour of the law. Before there was any general form of criminal appeal, a judge might grant a pardon either by way of clemency, because he felt in his opinion that the law was unduly harsh (for example, in the case of convictions of minors), that the verdict was dubious, to seek public approval, or it was otherwise in the public interest. Capital sentences imposed by the assizes were generally executed when the assize was concluded and as the circuit judge left the town, so there was a limited window of time to apply to a judge or directly to the Crown for a pardon. Especially for assizes that were far away from the then capital and major cities of London, York, Durham, Edinburgh, or Dublin, a pardon might well arrive too late. Perhaps as a form of temporary punishment, to give solace, to avoid public disorder, to consult or obtain further evidence, or to maximise the public approval of the King's mercy, judges often did not grant their pardons until their departures; the convict often hoped until his last moments that the sentence of death would not actually be executed, and it was generally popular for a reprieve to arrive at the scaffold at the very moment of the execution.In a 1655 case during the Commonwealth, a Roundhead judge rode from Cornwall to London and returned with Lord Protector Cromwell's pardon for the Royalist rebel William Wake whom he had himself sentenced to death; Wake had taken a beating for him when they were schoolboys together at Westminster School twenty years before. Budgell, Spectator No. 313. Thursday, February 28, 1712. Conditional pardons were granted to many in the 18th century, in return for transportation to British colonies overseas for life in lieu, especially to the Australian colonies. The first known general pardon in post-Conquest England was issued during the celebrations at the coronation of King Edward III in 1327. In 2006, all soldiers from England, Wales, Scotland, and Ireland who were executed for cowardice during the First World War were given a statutory pardon by an Act of Parliament (the Armed Forces Act 2006), following a long-running controversy about the justice of their executions. Today the sovereign only grants pardons upon the advice of her ministers: currently they are the Lord Chancellor, for England and Wales; the First Minister of Scotland; or the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland. The Secretary of State for Defence is responsible for military cases. It is the standard policy of the government to only grant pardons to those who are considered \\"morally\\" innocent of the offence, as opposed to those who may have been wrongly convicted by a misapplication of the law. Pardons are generally no longer issued prior to a conviction, but only after the conviction. The use of the royal prerogative of mercy is now a rare occurrence, given that the Criminal Cases Review Commission and the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission are now avenues to statutory remedies against miscarriages of justice. Therefore, the grant of pardons is now very rare occurrence indeed, and the vast majority of acknowledged miscarriages of justice were decided upon by the courts. During the Birmingham Six case, Home Secretary Douglas Hurd stressed that he could only make the decision for a pardon if he was \\"convinced of [their] innocence\\", which at the time he was not. One recent case was that of two drug smugglers, John Haase and Paul Bennett. They were pardoned in July 1996 from their sentences of imprisonment both of 18 years, having served some ten months, on the advice of Home Secretary Michael Howard. This was intended as a reward for their information given to the authorities, but there were speculations as to the motives of the Home Secretary. In 2008 they were sentenced to imprisonment for 20 and 22 years, respectively, after subsequent discovery that the information they gave was unreliable. In 1980, after the courts had dismissed their appeals, the Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, used the royal prerogative of mercy to free David Cooper and Michael McMahon from their imprisonment, both having been convicted of murder on poor evidence. Under the Act of Settlement 1701, a pardon cannot prevent a person from being impeached by Parliament, but a pardon may commute any penalties imposed for the conviction. In England and Wales no person may be pardoned for an offence under Section 11 of the Habeas Corpus Act 1679 (unlawfully transporting prisoners out of England and Wales). =United States= Thomas Nast asks pardon for his sketches.  U.S. Constitution  In the United States, the pardon power for offenses against the United States is granted to the President of the United States under Article II, Section 2 of the United States Constitution which states that the President \\"shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment\\". The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted this language to include the power to grant pardons, conditional pardons, commutations of sentence, conditional commutations of sentence, remissions of fines and forfeitures, respites, and amnesties. The pardon power of the President applies only to convictions under federal law. Additionally, the power extends to military court-martial cases, as well as convictions in the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. Almost all pardon petitions are addressed to the President, who grants or denies the request. In some cases, the President will, of his own accord, issue a pardon. Typically, applications for pardons are referred for review and non-binding recommendation by the Office of the Pardon Attorney, an official of the United States Department of Justice. State law The governors of most U.S. states have the power to grant pardons or reprieves for offenses under state criminal law. In other states, that power is committed to an appointed agency or board, or to a board and the governor in some hybrid arrangement (in some states the agency is merged with that of the parole board, as in the Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board). Nine states in the United States have boards of pardons and paroles that exclusively grant all state pardons. These states are: Alabama (Board of Pardons and Paroles), Connecticut (Board of Pardons and Paroles), Georgia (Board of Pardons and Paroles), Idaho (Commission of Pardons and Paroles), Minnesota (Board of Pardons), Nebraska (Board of Pardons), Nevada (Board of Pardon Commissioners), South Carolina (Board of Probation, Parole and Pardon), and Utah (Board of Pardons and Parole). On at least three occasions, state governors‚Äî Toney Anaya of New Mexico in 1986, George Ryan of Illinois in 2003, and Martin O'Malley of Maryland in 2014‚Äîhave commuted all death sentences in their respective states prior to leaving office. Related concepts These terms differ subtly from country to country, but generally: * Clemency is a general concept of amelioration of penalties, especially by action of executive officials; the forms it may take include the following: **Amnesty: A pardon applied to a group of people rather than an individual. President Jimmy Carter offered amnesty to anyone who had evaded the draft. Weapon amnesties are often granted so that people can hand in weapons to the police without any legal questions being asked as to where they obtained them, why they had them, etc. After a civil war a mass amnesty may be granted to absolve all participants of guilt and \\"move on\\". Amnesties are typically applied in advance of any prosecution for the crime. ** Commutation: Substituting the imposed penalty for a crime with a lesser penalty, whilst still remaining guilty of the original crime (e.g., someone who is guilty of murder may have their sentence commuted to life imprisonment rather than death, or the term of imprisonment may be reduced). ** Remission: Complete or partial cancellation of the penalty, whilst still being considered guilty of said crime (i.e., reduced penalty). (This should not be confused with what is known in USA as remission of remand, in which a case is sent back to a lower court from which it was appealed, with instructions as to what further proceedings should be held.) ** Reprieve: Temporary postponement of a punishment, usually so that the accused can mount an appeal (especially if he or she has been sentenced to death). See also ** Respite: The delay of an ordered sentence, or the act of temporarily imposing a lesser sentence upon the convicted, whilst further investigation, action, or appeals can be conducted. * Expungement: The process by which the record of a criminal conviction is destroyed or sealed from the official repository, thus removing any traces of guilt or conviction. * Immunity from prosecution: A prosecutor may grant immunity, usually to a witness, in exchange for testimony or production of other evidence. The prosecutor (conditionally) agrees not to prosecute a crime that the witness might have committed in exchange for said evidence. For example, a car thief who witnesses a murder might be granted immunity for his crime as an inducement to identify, and perhaps to truthfully testify against the murderer. * Other immunity: Several other types of immunity are available, depending on the status of a person as a member of the government. Some criminals who testify for the prosecution put their life in jeopardy by doing so. To encourage witnesses to testify, the government may offer witness protection. In the United States Federal Witness Protection Program, about \\"95% of [witnesses in the program] are ... criminals.\\"\\"Inside the witness protection program,\\" Gabriel Falcon, CNN, February 16, 2013. Those who testify for the prosecution may be offered immunity from prosecution for their own crimes.
