Locations and purposes There are numerous automobile graveyards that can be found around the world. The purpose of each location varies. Just outside Victorville, California there are hundreds of thousands of cars that were bought back by Volkswagen after the 2015 emissions scandal and they are awaiting recycling or destruction. Some cemeteries operate in a manner similar to scrapyards where rare spare parts can be found. The Historischer Autofriedhof G√ºrbetal in Kaufdorf comprised hundreds of cars, mostly from the 1930s to 1960s. The cars went untouched for more than 30 years. They were collected with the hope of salvaging useful and rare parts. However, time and nature led to the vehicles' decay. Overgrown with rare flora and fauna, the site had to be cleared when environmental concerns were raised in 2009. Sites containing such cemeteries can become public attractions. In the U.S. state of Georgia, Wade Alonso's Auto Parts & Wrecker Service is colloquially known as \\"The School Bus Graveyard\\". Looking for a way to reduce theft from his property, Alonso built a large wall using school buses and RVs. Many of the state's artists came to paint the sides of the buses, creating a colourful and unusual art gallery around which people are freely welcome to wander. Also in Georgia is Old Car City USA, world's largest car junkyard, a site which began in 1931 as a car dealership but now serves as a 6-mile trail for visitors to discover over 4,000 cars. While many automobile graveyards are easily accessible, others are much less welcoming. In 2016 urban explorers found a \\"mountain of vehicles\\" in an abandoned Welsh mine. The cars were piled up at the bottom of the slate mine and are believed to have been there since the 1970s. Such sites can also be popular amongst photographers. Some automobile cemeteries do not contain civilian vehicles such as cars and motorbikes, but specialized vehicles instead. French authorities set up a warehouse to help preserve firefighting history, storing fire engines that date back to the early 20th century. The vehicles, though covered in dust, were protected from the elements, but after an urban explorer published photographs of the site they were all moved to a new, secret location. There are also sites with numerous armoured vehicles, sometimes referred to as a tank graveyard. Another notable specialized vehicles graveyard is the race car graveyard located in North Carolina owned by NASCAR driver Dale Earnhardt Jr., which became the final resting place for cars such as Juan Pablo Montoya's 2012 Daytona 500 car that collided with a jet dryer during the race.

Biography  Jean Delespine was a renowned architect. The Renaissance in Anjou owes much to the artistic and architectural production of this master builder. Today he is attributed about forty works, almost all located in the former province of Anjou. Jean Delespine was, at his beginnings, the student of Jean Mariau, an architect in Angers, to whom he succeeded, in 1535, as Commissaire des ≈ìuvres et r√©parations de la ville of Angers. Delespine was in charge of important urban developments. He worked under the direction of a succession of mayors, including , and .

In 1571, Delespine ceased his duties as curator of the city's works. In 1576, he died in his home of the rue Beaurepaire in Angers. His body lies in the church next to the Carmelite convent. His tomb bore an epitaph to the glory of his architectural talents: ... mais qui n‚Äôadmireroit ta hardie entreprise / de ta brave lanterne au pignon de l‚Äô√©glise / pos√©e en l‚Äôair si hault entre deux piramides / dont les poincts eslevez touchent aux nues liquides / .... also reports some extracts of this epitaph: On cognoist l'arbre au fruit, l'ouvrier √† l'ouvrage / les tiens portent assez, L'Espine, tesmoignage / De l'excellent esprit dont Dieu t'avoit pourveu / quand parmi les plus grands en cr√©dit on t√©a veu.

Bewsey Old Hall and estate was home to the Lords of Warrington from the thirteenth to the seventeenth century. The name 'Bewsey' is believed to have been derived from the French 'Beau Se', or 'is beautiful' and likely refers to the hall's position on the edge of Burton Wood, next to Sankey Brook  History  Sir William Fitz Almeric Le Boteler, Lord of Warrington built Bewsey Old Hall following the destruction by fire of his original house, which was located nearer the current town centre on the Mote Hill (near to the site of the current parish church, St Elphins). The date of the fire is not recorded exactly, but is believed to be between the years 1256 and 1259. In order to build the house, Boteler obtained lands in Burton Wood from his feudal Lord, Earl Ferrar in 1260 and from Prince Edmund in 1270.A History of Warrington, Harry Boscow, Page 50, A monastic grange, owned by the monks of Titley Abbey, in Essex, previously occupied the site. The first hall, a single storey wooden medieval hall, of which nothing now remains was replaced by a brick building in the 16th century. Bewsey Old Hall passed to Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester in 1586 in settlement of gambling debts when Edward Boteler died without an heir. Dudley sold the estate to lawyer Thomas Ireland, of Childwall, and the house remained in the possession of the Ireland family for six generations until 1675. Sir Thomas was knighted at Bewsey by King James I in 1617, the king later stayed the night at Bewsey. Bewsey was inherited by the Atherton family in 1675, although it was not their main home, with relatively nearby Atherton Hall, Leigh being their primary residence. In the mid eighteenth century they added a new wing to the building. Legend states that the Stuart prince Bonnie Prince Charlie stayed the night there, on his retreat from Derby during the Jacobite rising of 1745. The house passed by marriage to the Lilford family in 1797, when the Atherton estate was inherited by Thomas Powys, Lord Lilford, who preferred to live at the family seat, Lilford Hall in Northamptonshire. The Lilfords also inherited Atherton Hall, however, they considered one property in Lancashire adequate for their needs and lavished considerable expense on Bewsey Hall. After failing to sell Atherton Hall which was less than a century old, it was demolished in 1824, with some of the furniture and carpets being sent to Bewsey. They later demolished the eighteenth century wing and in 1860-61 a new half-timbered house (Bewsey New Hall) was built on a different site west of Camp Road for Thomas Powys, 4th Baron Lilford as a replacement for the Old Hall, with the original hall being converted into two farmhouses and let to tenants. The new building was almost certainly designed by W.G. Habershon, but Lady Lilford disliked the house so much that she refused to live in it and it was largely demolished in the 1940s, apart from a fragment of the west wing.  Building and grounds  The original fourteenth century moat only partly holds water today. The building has distinctive chimneystacks and stone mullion windows which are most likely the work of Sir Thomas Ireland and date back to around 1600. Bewsey's remaining medieval structures were demolished during the eighteenth century, when the hall was extended, and landscaping works filled in parts of the moat and enlarged others as water features. In 1863, a 'New Hall' was built, and Bewsey Old Hall was left in the hands of tenants, until, in considerable disrepair, it was acquired by Warrington Development Corporation in 1974.  Notable events  Sir John Boteler, Lord of Warrington, was murdered in his bed in 1521 at Bewsey Hall, the murderers allegedly acting on the orders of his brother-in-law, Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby, with whom he had been on bad terms for some time. Sir Piers Legh and Sir William Savage, whom Stanley had employed to carry out the deed, bribed the porter at Bewsey to place a lighted taper in a certain window when the house had settled down for the evening. They then crossed the moat in a coracle like boat and stole into Sir John's bed chamber, a struggle with the chamberlain ensued who was also murdered. They later hung the treacherous servant from a tree in the Bewsey estate, so that he could not give evidence against them.  Recent history  Warrington New Town Development Corporation purchased the house from Lord Lilford in 1974. In September, 2011, the hall was subject to an arson attack, and lost part of its roof. Despite local campaigns against it, a public inquiry, held in May and September of 2011 granted permission for seven flats to be built in the Grade II* listed hall.

History The original hospital in Hemel Hempstead was established when Sir Astley Cooper converted a row of cottages at 130‚Äì136 Piccotts End to create an infirmary in 1827. The medical team moved to larger premises, acquired with funding from Sir John Sebright, 7th Baronet, at Cheere House at the bottom of Hillfield Road in 1832. The main block of the current hospital, then known as the West Hertfordshire Infirmary, was built further up Hillfield Road and was opened by Princess Mary of Teck in 1877. The hospital expanded to take military patients during the First World War. The Marnham Maternity Wing, which was started in 1926 when a foundation stone was laid by the Prince of Wales just north of the main block, opened in 1929. A children's ward was added in 1939 and another new block was opened by the Queen Mother in 1959. The Verulam Wing, at the south-east end of the site, was added in 1992, the Jubilee Wing, just south of the main block, followed in 2002 and major enhancements consisting of an urgent care centre and a GP-led health centre were introduced within the Jubilee Wing in October 2008 and spring 2009 respectively. Services Most departments are located in the Verulam Wing; however the urgent care centre and the health centre form part of the Jubilee Wing. Controversy Large parts of the hospital site are currently mothballed and not actively used for healthcare provision, following the removal of the Accident & Emergency department in 2006. The West Hertfordshire Hospitals NHS Trust, which operates the site and two others in Watford and St Albans, has announced plans to redevelop its properties and relocate key services to Watford General Hospital, in effect further downgrading the status of the Hemel Hempstead Hospital. However, these plans have attracted criticism from local residents groups, such as the Dacorum Hospital Action Group, who favour a newly built hospital equidistant from the three major population centres and who have launched a judicial review of the Trust's plan.

Klein‚Äôs own production started touring US and Canada in January 1993.

As a juvenile in 1925 she showed promising form by winning once and finishing second in three races including the Rous Memorial Stakes and the Cheveley Park Stakes. On her three-year-old debut she recorded a 25/1 upset victory in the 1000 Guineas. She was retired from racing at the end of the season and had some influence as a broodmare. Background Pillion was a bay mare bred and owned by Anthony Gustav de Rothschild. She was set into training with John Watson at the Palace House stable in Newmarket in Suffolk. Her sire Chaucer won the Gimcrack Stakes as a juvenile in 1902, and later proved himself a high-class performer in handicap races. As a breeding stallion he sired the 1000 Guineas winner Canyon and was the damsire of Fairway, Hyperion, Pharos and Sickle. Pillion's dam Double Back also produced the Coventry Stakes winner Reflector and was a descendant of the influential broodmare Sunray. Racing career =1925: two-year-old season= In 1925 Pillion recorded her only win from five starts at Nottingham Racecourse in summer when she won the ¬£1,000 Nottinghamshire Breeders' Foal Plate. In the Rous Memorial Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse in July she ran well but was no match for the colt Coronach. In October, Pillion finished second to Karra in the Cheveley Park Stakes over six furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse. In her two other races that year the filly finished second in the Houghton Stakes and ran fourth in the Champion Breeders' Foal Stakes at Derby. In the Free Handicap, ranking of the year's best two-year-olds, Pillion was placed in joint 24th place, fourteen pounds behind the top-rated Colorado. =1926: three-year-old season= On 30 April Pillion, ridden by Dick Perryman, started a 25/1 outsider in a twenty- nine runner field for the 113th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket Racecourse. Karra started favourite but made no impact as Pillion went to the front a quarter of a mile from the finish and won \\"nicely\\" by a length from Trilogy with half a length back to Short Story in third. In the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse a month later Pillion started 11/2 second favourite but after disputing the lead until the final turn she tired in the last quarter mile and finished fifth of the sixteen runners behind Short Story. Later that year, the filly reportedly won the Stewards Handicap at Nottingham. Assessment and honours In their book, A Century of Champions, based on the Timeform rating system, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Pillion an \\"inferior\\" winner of the 1000 Guineas. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Pillion was retired to become a broodmare. She produced at least two foals between 1932 and 1938: *Tandem, a bay colt, foaled in 1932, sired by Tetratema *Pilch, bay filly, 1938, by Windsor Lad. Dam of Aldborough (Doncaster Cup) and granddam of Kythnos (Irish 2000 Guineas). Pedigree * Pillion was inbred 2 √ó 4 to St Simon, meaning that this stallion appears in both the second and fourth generations of her pedigree.

On January 30, 2018, The CW officially ordered the pilot. The series was greenlit on May 11, 2018. In the Dark is the first CW primetime series to carry Descriptive Video Service audio, though The CW, as a minor network, is not required to have any DVS provisions under the regulations for audio description for their affiliates, so the base of stations carrying that track is smaller than other networks where carriage of descriptive video is required. On January 10, 2019, The CW announced the premiere of the series on April 4 at 9 p.m. On April 24, 2019, The CW renewed the series for a second season, that was originally scheduled to premiere on May 28, 2020, however it was moved to premiere date on April 16, 2020.

Austin Nichols was cast as Dean, a cop with a blind daughter, on March 12. On May 16, 2018, The CW announced that the role of Dean had been recast; with Nichols thereafter replaced by Rich Sommer on July 13, 2018. On September 10, 2019, Matt Murray was cast in a recurring role for the second season. =Criticism over lack of disabled actors= The show received some criticism for casting a sighted actor to play a blind character. British actor James Moore, who plays a disabled character in the soap opera Emmerdale and has a disability himself, argued that disabled actors will always be better placed to play disabled roles due to their life experience. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, critics worried that the \\"questionable treatment of physical handicaps may leave some viewers with a dim impression.\\" During a panel discussion at the Television Critics Association press tour, executive producer Nicky Weinstock defended the choices, claiming that they initially auditioned blind actors, but ultimately cast Perry because she was the best actor for the role. =Filming= Filming on the pilot began on March 12, 2018, in Toronto, Ontario, Canada; and wrapped on March 28. Principal photography on season 1 began on August 8, 2018, and ended on December 21, 2018.

Completed in 1931, Shoreham served pre-war in the Persian Gulf. In the Second World War she served in the Gulf and Red Sea, the Mediterranean and the Indian Ocean. She survived the war and was sold for commercial use in 1946 and was scrapped in 1950. Construction and design The British Admiralty ordered four sloops of the new as part of the 1929 construction programme, with two each ordered from Devonport and Chatham dockyards. They were an improved version of the of the 1928 programme, which were themselves a modification of the . They were intended for a dual role of patrol service in overseas stations in peacetime and minesweeping during war. Shoreham was long overall, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard. Two Admiralty 3-drum water-tube boilers fed two geared steam turbines which drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was rated at , giving a speed of . The ship's main gun armament consisted of two 4-inch (102 mm) QF Mk V guns mounted fore-and-aft on the ship's centreline, with the forward gun on a High-Angle (HA) anti-aircraft mounting and the aft gun on a Low-Angle (LA) mounting, suitable only for use against surface targets. Four 3-pounder saluting guns completed the ship's gun armament. The initial anti-submarine armament consisted of four depth charges. Shoreham was ordered on 23 September 1929 and was laid down at Chatham on 19 December 1929. She was launched on 22 November 1930 and completed on 2 November 1931. =Modifications= One of Shorehams 4-inch guns was removed in 1933, but was reinstated in 1934. In 1938, Shorehams anti-aircraft armament was improved by replacing the aft 4-inch gun by a similar gun on a HA mounting, while a quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun mount was fitted for close-in anti-aircraft duties. During the Second World War, the ship's 3-pounder saluting guns were removed to accommodate more useful armament. The ship's anti aircraft armament was gradually increased, first by fitted a second quadruple machine gun mount, and then by the addition of Oerlikon 20 mm cannons and finally a 2-pounder \\"pom-pom\\" anti-aircraft gun, giving an ultimate anti-aircraft outfit of three Oerlikons and one 2-pounder. One 3-pounder saluting gun was re-instated after the war, when Shoreham returned to the Gulf. The ship's anti-submarine armament was also gradually increased during the war, with the number of depth charges carried increasing from 15 to as many as 60‚Äì90. Other wartime changes included the fitting of radar and HF/DF radio direction-finding gear. Service On commissioning, Shoreham was deployed to the Persian Gulf, where she served continuously, except for refits, until the outbreak of the Second World War. She was refitted at Colombo in Ceylon in October 1932, and at Bombay in 1933, 1934 and 1938. In January 1939, Shoreham was refitted and rearmed at Malta, before returning to the Gulf. The outbreak of war saw Shoreham continue to be based in the Gulf, patrolling and checking shipping for contraband. In May 1940 the ship transferred to the Red Sea. Italy's declaration of war on 10 June 1940 brought Royal Navy forces in the Red Sea into conflict with the Italian Red Sea Flotilla. On 18 June 1940 the Italian submarine was spotted off Aden by a patrolling aircraft and attacked unsuccessfully by two RAF bombers. Shoreham and the destroyer were sent out to intercept, but a depth charge attack by Khandahar was unsuccessful and the submarine escaped. On 23 June 1940, Shoreham, together with the destroyers Khandahar, and encountered the Italian submarine off Perim Island. A gun duel between the British ships and Torricelli took place in which both Shoreham and Khartoum were hit by shells from the Italian submarine and Toricelli was sunk. Several hours later, Khartoum was sunk when a fire resulting from the action caused one of her magazines to explode. On 3 August 1940, Italy invaded British Somaliland. The British position soon became untenable, and it was decided to evacuate the British troops from the port of Berbera. The evacuation began on 14 August, with Shoreham taking part in the evacuation. In total, 7140 people were evacuated to Aden by the time the evacuation ended on 19 August. On 23 May 1941, Shoreham intercepted the German merchant ship Oder, which had left Massawa earlier that day, near Perim. Oder scuttled herself. Shoreham was refitted in Bombay in April‚ÄìMay 1941, after which she moved back to the Persian Gulf. On 25 August 1941 Britain and the Soviet Union invaded Iran. Shoreham was assigned to the attack on Abadan, covering the landing of the 24th Indian Infantry Brigade which was tasked with taking the oil refineries in the city. The landings took the Iranians by surprise, and Shoreham sank the which was berthed in the port. After the invasion was completed Shoreham returned to the Red Sea, serving as anti-aircraft guard ship at Suez, and in January 1942 transferred to the Eastern Fleet, based at Colombo. Shoreham was refitted at Bombay from October 1942 to February 1943 and then moved to the Mediterranean, joining the Levant Command. On 10 July 1943 Shoreham was part of the naval force supporting Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. In September 1943 Shoreham returned to the Eastern fleet, escorting convoys off the West coast of India. From March to June 1944 Shoreham was refitted at Cape Town and then returned to the Eastern Fleet, where she was employed on convoy escort of the East coast of India. On 2 January 1945, Shoreham took part in Operation Lightning, landing of British and Indian troops on the Akyab peninsular, with Shoreham helping to land troops of the 3rd Commando Brigade. She was refitted at Durban in April 1945, then returned to her escort duties, which continued until the end of the war. After the end of the war, Shoreham was transferred to the Persian Gulf, where she served until July 1946. She then returned to Britain for the first time since first commissioning, and was laid up for disposal. Shoreham was sold on 4 November 1946 for commercial service, and was renamed Jorge F El Joven. She was scrapped at Zeebrugge from November 1950.

Early life and education  As a child, Rogers was interested in deadly sea creatures. Rogers became interested in leopard seals whilst working as a seal trainer at Taronga Zoo. The call of Astrid, a giant female leopard seal, inspired Rogers to pursue a career in research. Rogers completed her PhD, \\"Acoustic behaviour of the leopard seal, Hydrurga leptonyx : physical characteristics and functional significance\\", in 1997 at the University of Sydney.  Research  Rogers has served as Director of the Australian Marine Mammal Research Centre. She joined the University of New South Wales in 2008. Her lab at the University of New South Wales study mammals, in particular the leopard seal (an Antarctic apex predator), and their response to changing environments. To do this, she studies changes in the seals' diet and habits over time. She identified that if mother seals stay with their pups, father seals only use simple, crude calls, whereas if mothers are more adventurous, the language becomes more complex. She also found that female leopard seals can also sing during breeding season, which is rare in the animal world. She believes that leopard seals might use the high-frequency (165 kHz) to echolocate food during dark winters. She identified that more juvenile seals stayed together, where as older, more dominant seals have more established territories. She studies seals at the Commonwealth Bay and Prydz Bay. The seals are tricky to study as they live in dangerous pack ice off coastal Antarctica, making observations difficult. To identify how the seals respond to a changing ecosystem, Rogers studies them using acoustic technology (hydrophones and retired military sonar buoys). During expeditions, the team take biopsies and collect fur from seals in the wild, which can be used as biomarkers to \\"capture the changes in an individual's diet, environment, climate, health, and stress levels\\". These can be compared to seals in museum collections, collected by Douglas Mawson and Ernest Shackleton, to work out how changes in the ecosystem impact the food chain. By understanding how climate change impacts species in the Antarctic, they can predict how they will cope with changes in the future. She is now considered the word-expert in leopard seals. She has also studied the composition of Whale mucus with the Sydney Institute of Marine Science. She was awarded the Australian Institute of Policy and Science Young Tall Poppy Science Researcher prize in 2005, and became the Tall Poppy ambassador in 2009. The children at Castle Cove Primary School were so inspired by her seal research they wanted to contribute, and raised money for a satellite tracker off the Western Antarctic Peninsula. Rogers named one of the seals they observed Milo, after a school mascot, and the class tracked it in the ocean for 12 months. Rogers contributes to The Conversation, National Geographic and Nature. She appeared on The Life Scientific in September 2017.

It was internationally recognised by the Treaty of Constantinople, where Greece also secured its full independence from the Ottoman Empire after nearly four centuries. The Kingdom of Greece was dissolved in 1924 and the Second Hellenic Republic was established following Greece's defeat by Turkey in the Asia Minor Campaign. A military coup d'√©tat restored the monarchy in 1935 and Greece became a Kingdom again until 1973. The Kingdom was finally dissolved in the aftermath of a seven-year military dictatorship (1967‚Äì1974) and the Third Hellenic Republic was established following a referendum held in 1974. Background The Greek-speaking Eastern Roman Empire, also known as Byzantine Empire, which ruled most of the Eastern Mediterranean region for over 1100 years, had been fatally weakened since the sacking of Constantinople by the Latin Crusaders in 1204. The Ottomans captured Constantinople with ease in 1453 and advanced southwards into the Balkan peninsula capturing Athens in 1458. The Greeks held out in the Peloponnese until 1460, and the Venetians and Genoese clung to some of the islands, but by 1500 most of the plains and islands of Greece were in Ottoman hands. The mountains of Greece were largely untouched, and were a refuge for Greeks to flee foreign rule and engage in guerrilla warfare. Preparation of the Greek War of Independence In the context of ardent desire for independence from Turkish occupation, and with the explicit influence of similar secret societies elsewhere in Europe, three Greeks came together in 1814 in Odessa to decide the constitution for a secret organization in freemasonic fashion. Its purpose was to unite all Greeks in an armed organization to overthrow Turkish rule. The three founders were Nikolaos Skoufas from the Arta province, Emmanuil Xanthos from Patmos and Athanasios Tsakalov from Ioannina. (retrieved from University of California Library) Soon after they initiated a fourth member, Panagiotis Anagnostopoulos from Andritsaina. Many revolts were planned across the Greek region and the first of them was launched on 6 March 1821, in the Danubian principalities. It was put down by the Ottomans, but the torch had been lit and by the end of the same month the Peloponnese was in open revolt. Greek War of Independence In 1821, the Greek-speaking populations of Peloponnesus revolted against the Ottoman Empire. Following a region-wide struggle that lasted several months, the Greek War of Independence led to the establishment of the first autonomous Greek State since the mid-15th century. In January 1822, the First National Assembly of Epidaurus passed the Greek Declaration of Independence (part of the country's First Constitution), which affirmed the sovereignty of Greece. However, the new Greek State was politically unstable and lacked the resources to preserve its territoriality in the long-term. Most importantly, the country lacked international recognition and had no robust alliances in the Western world. Following the recapture of the Greek territories by the Ottoman Empire, the Great Powers of that time (the British Empire, the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of France) saw the Greek counter-offensive as an opportunity to weaken the Ottoman Empire further and in essence increase their influence in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Great Powers supported Greece to regain its independence and following a decisive battle in the Navarino Bay a cease fire was agreed in London (see Treaty of London (1827)). The autonomy of Greece was ultimately recognised by the London Protocol of 1828 and its full independence from the Ottoman Empire by the Protocol of London of 1830. In 1831, the assassination of the first Governor of Greece, Count Ioannis Kapodistrias, created political and social instability that endangered the country's relationship with its allies. To avoid escalation and in order to strengthen Greece's ties with the Great Powers, Greece agreed to become a Kingdom in 1832 (see Treaty of London (1832)). Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha was initially the first candidate for the Greek throne; however, he turned down the offer. Otto of Wittelsbach, Prince of Bavaria was chosen as its first King. Otto arrived at the provisional capital, Nafplion, in 1833 aboard a British warship. History =Reign of King Otto (1832‚Äì1862)= Otto, the first King of modern Greece Otto's reign would prove troubled, but managed to last for 30 years before he and his wife, Queen Amalia, left the way they came, aboard a British warship. During the early years of his reign, a group of Bavarian Regents ruled in his name and made themselves very unpopular by trying to impose German ideas of rigid hierarchical government on the Greeks, while keeping most significant state offices away from them. Nevertheless, they laid the foundations of a Greek administration, army, justice system and education system. Otto was sincere in his desire to give Greece good government, but he suffered from two great handicaps, his Roman Catholic faith, and the fact that his marriage to Queen Amalia remained childless. Furthermore, the new Kingdom tried to eliminate the traditional banditry, something that in many cases meant conflict with some old revolutionary fighters (klephtes) who continued to exercise this practice. The Bavarian Regents ruled until 1837, when at the insistence of Britain and France, they were recalled, and Otto after that appointed Greek ministers, although Bavarian officials still ran most of the administration and the army. But Greece still had no legislature and no constitution. Greek discontent grew until a revolt broke out in Athens in September 1843. Otto agreed to grant a constitution, and convened a National Assembly which met in November. The new constitution created a bicameral parliament, consisting of an Assembly (Vouli) and a Senate (Gerousia). Power then passed into the hands of a group of politicians, most of whom had been commanders in the War of Independence against the Ottomans. Greek politics in the 19th century was dominated by the national question. Greeks dreamed of liberating all the Greek lands and reconstituting a state embracing them all, with Constantinople as its capital. This was called the Great Idea (Megali Idea), and it was sustained by almost continuous rebellions against Ottoman rule in Greek-speaking territories, notably Crete, Thessaly and Macedonia. During the Crimean War the British occupied Piraeus to prevent Greece declaring war on the Ottomans as a Russian ally. A new generation of Greek politicians was growing increasingly intolerant of King Otto's continuing interference in government. In 1862, the King dismissed his Prime Minister, the former admiral Constantine Kanaris, the most prominent politician of the period. This dismissal provoked a military rebellion, forcing Otto to accept the inevitable and leave the country. The Greeks then asked Britain to send Queen Victoria's son Prince Alfred as their new king, but this was vetoed by the other Powers. Instead, a young Danish prince became King George I. George was a very popular choice as a constitutional monarch, and he agreed that his sons would be raised in the Greek Orthodox faith. As a reward to the Greeks for adopting a pro-British King, Britain ceded the United States of the Ionian Islands to Greece. =Religious life= Under Ottoman rule, the Greek Church was a part of the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. The Muslims had no control over the church. With the establishment of the Greek Kingdom, however, the government decided to take control of the church, breaking away from the patriarch in Constantinople. The government declared the church to be autocephalous (Independent) in 1833 in a political decision of the Bavarian Regents acting for King Otto, who was a minor. The decision roiled Greek politics for decades as royal authorities took increasing control. The new status was finally recognised as such by the Patriarchate in 1850, under compromise conditions with the issue of a special \\"Tomos\\" decree which brought it back to a normal status. As a result, it retains certain special links with the \\"Mother Church\\". There were only four bishops, and they had political roles.Kenneth Scott Latourette, Christianity in a Revolutionary Age, II: The Nineteenth Century in Europe: The Protestant and Eastern Churches. (1959) 2: 479‚Äì481 In 1833 Parliament dissolved 400 small monasteries having fewer than five monks or nuns. Priests were not salaried; in rural areas he was a peasant farmer himself, dependent for his livelihood on his farm work and from fees and offerings by his parishioners. His ecclesiastical duties were limited to administering the sacraments, supervising funerals, the blessings of crops, and exorcism. Few attended seminaries. By the 1840s, there was a nationwide revival, run by travelling preachers. The government arrested several and tried to shut down the revival, but it proved too powerful when the revivalists denounced three bishops for purchasing their office. By the 1880s the \\"Anaplasis\\" (\\"Regeneration\\") Movement led to renewed spiritual energy and enlightenment. It fought against the rationalistic and materialistic ideas that had seeped in from secular Western Europe. It promoted catechism schools, and circles for the study the Bible.Latourette, Christianity in a Revolutionary Age (1959) 2: 481‚Äì83 =Reign of King George I (1863‚Äì1913)= King George I of the Hellenes At the urging of Britain and King George, Greece adopted a much more democratic constitution in 1864. The powers of the King were reduced and the Senate was abolished, and the franchise was extended to all adult males. Nevertheless, Greek politics remained heavily dynastic, as it had always been. Family names such as Zaimis, Rallis and Trikoupis repeatedly occurred as Prime Ministers. Although parties were centered around the individual leaders, often bearing their names, two broad political tendencies existed: the liberals, led first by Charilaos Trikoupis and later by Eleftherios Venizelos, and the conservatives, led initially by Theodoros Deligiannis and later by Thrasivoulos Zaimis. Trikoupis and Deligiannis dominated Greek politics in the later 19th century, alternating in office. Trikoupis favoured cooperation with Great Britain in foreign affairs, the creation of infrastructure and an indigenous industry, raising protective tariffs and progressive social legislation, while the more populist Deligiannis depended on the promotion of Greek nationalism and the Megali Idea. Greece remained a quite impoverished country throughout the 19th century. The country lacked raw materials, infrastructure and capital. Agriculture was mostly at the subsistence level, and the only important export commodities were currants, raisins and tobacco. Some Greeks grew rich as merchants and shipowners, and Piraeus became a major port, but little of this wealth found its way to the Greek peasantry. Greece remained hopelessly in debt to London finance houses. By the 1890s Greece was virtually bankrupt, and public insolvency was declared in 1893. Poverty was rife in the rural areas and the islands and was eased only by large-scale emigration to the United States. There was little education in the countryside. Nevertheless, there was progress in building communications and infrastructure, and elegant public buildings were erected in Athens. Despite the bad financial situation, Athens staged the revival of the Olympic Games in 1896, which proved a great success. The Hellenic Parliament in the 1880s, with PM Charilaos Trikoupis standing at the podium Fencing before King George, during the 1896 Summer Olympics The parliamentary process developed greatly in Greece during the reign of George I. Initially, the royal prerogative in choosing his prime minister remained and contributed to governmental instability, until the introduction of the dedilomeni principle of parliamentary confidence in 1875 by the reformist Charilaos Trikoupis. Clientelism and frequent electoral upheavals, however, remained the norm in Greek politics and frustrated the country's development. Corruption and Trikoupis' increased spending to create necessary infrastructure like the Corinth Canal overtaxed the weak Greek economy, forcing the declaration of public insolvency in 1893 and to accept the imposition of an International Financial Control authority to pay off the country's debtors.Maria Christina Chatziioannou, \\"Relations between the state and the private sphere: speculation and corruption in nineteenth-century Greece 1.\\" Mediterranean Historical Review 23#1 (2008): 1‚Äì14. Another political issue in 19th-century Greece was uniquely Greek: the language question. The Greek people spoke a form of Greek called Demotic. Many of the educated elite saw this as a peasant dialect and were determined to restore the glories of Ancient Greek. Government documents and newspapers were consequently published in Katharevousa (purified) Greek, a form which few ordinary Greeks could read. Liberals favoured recognising Demotic as the national language, but conservatives and the Orthodox Church resisted all such efforts, to the extent that, when the New Testament was translated into Demotic in 1901, riots erupted in Athens and the government fell (the Evangeliaka). This issue would continue to plague Greek politics until the 1970s. All Greeks were united, however, in their determination to liberate the Greek-speaking provinces of the Ottoman Empire. Especially in Crete, a prolonged revolt in 1866‚Äì1869 had raised nationalist fervour. When war broke out between Russia and the Ottomans in 1877, popular Greek sentiment rallied to Russia's side, but Greece was too poor and too concerned about British intervention, to officially enter the war. Nevertheless, in 1881, Thessaly and small parts of Epirus were ceded to Greece in the context of the Treaty of Berlin, while frustrating Greek hopes of receiving Crete. Presidential Mansion Greeks in Crete continued to stage regular revolts, and in 1897, the Greek government under Theodoros Deligiannis, bowing to popular pressure, declared war on the Ottomans. In the ensuing Greco-Turkish War of 1897 the badly trained and equipped Greek army was defeated by the Ottomans. Through the intervention of the Great Powers, however, Greece lost only a little territory along the border to Turkey, while Crete was established as an autonomous state with the High Commissioner being Prince George of Greece. Nationalist sentiment among Greeks in the Ottoman Empire continued to grow, and by the 1890s there were constant disturbances in Macedonia. Here the Greeks were in competition not only with the Ottomans but also with the Bulgarians, engaged in an armed propaganda struggle for the hearts and minds of the ethnically mixed local population, the so-called \\"Macedonian Struggle\\". In July 1908, the Young Turk Revolution broke out in the Ottoman Empire. Taking advantage of the Ottoman internal turmoil, Austria-Hungary annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Bulgaria declared its independence from the Ottoman Empire. On Crete, the local population, led by a young politician named Eleftherios Venizelos, declared Enosis, Union with Greece, provoking another crisis. The fact that the Greek government, led by Dimitrios Rallis, proved unable likewise to take advantage of the situation and bring Crete into the fold, rankled with many Greeks, especially with young officers. These formed a secret society, the \\"Military League\\", with the purpose of emulating their Ottoman colleagues and seek reforms.Zorka Parvanova, \\"Crete and Macedonia Between National Ideals and Geopolitics (1878‚Äì1913).\\" Etudes balkaniques 1 (2015): 87‚Äì107. The resulting Goudi coup on 15 August 1909 marked a watershed in modern Greek history: as the military conspirators were inexperienced in politics, they asked Venizelos, who had impeccable liberal credentials, to come to Greece as their political adviser. Venizelos quickly established himself as an influential political figure, and his allies won the August 1910 elections. Venizelos became Prime Minister in October 1910, ushering a period of 25 years where his personality would dominate Greek politics. Venizelos initiated a major reform program, including a new and more liberal constitution and reforms in the spheres of public administration, education and economy. French and British military missions were invited for the army and navy respectively, and arms purchases were made. In the meantime, the Ottoman Empire's weaknesses were revealed by the ongoing Italo-Turkish War in Libya. Through spring 1912, a series of bilateral agreements among the Balkan states (Greece, Bulgaria, Montenegro and Serbia) formed the Balkan League, which in October 1912 declared war on the Ottoman Empire. =Balkan Wars= Macedonian front Greek military operations during the First Balkan War (borders depicted are post-Second Balkan War) Ottoman intelligence had disastrously misread Greek military intentions. In retrospect, it would appear that the Ottoman staffs believed that the Greek attack would be shared equally between the two primary avenues of approach, Macedonia and Epirus. The 2nd Army staff had therefore evenly balanced the combat strength of the seven Ottoman divisions between the Yanya Corps and VIII Corps, in Epirus and Macedonia respectively. The Greek Army also fielded seven divisions, but, having the initiative, concentrated all seven against VIII Corps, leaving only a number of independent battalions of scarcely divisional strength in the Epirus front. This had fatal consequences for the Western Group of Armies, since it led to the early loss of the strategic centre of all three Macedonian fronts, the city of Thessaloniki, a fact that sealed their fate.Erickson (2003), p. 215 In an unexpectedly brilliant and rapid campaign, the Army of Thessaly seized the city. In the absence of secure sea lines of communications, the retention of the Thessaloniki-Constantinople corridor was essential to the overall strategic posture of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans. Once this was gone, the defeat of the Ottoman Army became inevitable. To be sure, the Bulgarians and the Serbs played a significant role in the defeat of the main Ottoman armies. Their great victories at Kirkkilise, L√ºleburgaz, Kumanovo, and Monastir shattered the Eastern and Vardar armies. However, these victories were not decisive in the sense that they ended the war. The Ottoman field armies survived, and in Thrace, they actually grew stronger day by day. In the strategic point of view these victories were enabled partially by the weakened condition of the Ottoman armies brought about by the active presence of the Greek army and fleet.Erickson (2003), p. 334 With the declaration of war, the Greek Army of Thessaly under Crown Prince Constantine advanced to the north, successfully overcoming Ottoman opposition in the fortified Straits of Sarantaporo. After another victory at Giannitsa on , the Ottoman commander Hasan Tahsin Pasha surrendered Thessaloniki and its garrison of 26,000 men to the Greeks on . Two Corps HQs (Ustruma and VIII), two Nizamiye divisions (14th and 22nd) and four Redif divisions (Salonika, Drama, Naslic and Serez) were thus lost to the Ottoman order of battle. Additionally, the Ottoman forces lost 70 artillery pieces, 30 machine guns and 70,000 rifles (Thessaloniki was the central arms depot for the Western Armies). The Ottoman forces estimated that 15,000 officers and men had been killed during the campaign in Macedonia, bringing total losses up to 41,000 soldiers. Another direct consequence was that the destruction of the Macedonian Army sealed the fate of the Ottoman Vardar Army, which was fighting the Serbs to the north. The fall of Thessaloniki left it strategically isolated, without logistical supply and depth to manoeuvre, ensuring its destruction. Upon learning of the outcome of the battle of Yenidje, the Bulgarian high command urgently dispatched their 7th Rila Division from the north in the direction of the city. The division arrived there a week later, the day after its surrender to the Greeks. Until 10 November, the Greek- occupied zone had been expanded to the line from Lake Dojran to the Pangaion hills west to Kavalla. In southern Yugoslavia however, the lack of coordination between the Greek and Serbian HQs cost the Greeks a setback in the Battle of Vevi on , when the Greek 5th Infantry Division crossed its way with the VI Ottoman Corps (a part of the Vardar Army consisting of the 16th, 17th and 18th Nizamiye divisions), retreating to Albania following the battle of Prilep against the Serbs. The Greek division, surprised by the presence of the Ottoman Corps, isolated from the rest of Greek army and outnumbered by the now counterattacking Ottomans centred on Bitola, was forced to retreat. As a result, the Serbs beat the Greeks to Bitola. Epirus front In the Epirus front the Greek army was initially heavily outnumbered, but due to the passive attitude of the Ottomans succeeded in conquering Preveza (21 October 1912) and pushing north to the direction of Ioannina. On 5 November, Major Spyros Spyromilios led a revolt in the coastal area of Himar√´ and expelled the Ottoman garrison without facing significant resistance,Epirus, 4000 years of Greek history and civilization. M. V. Sakellariou. Ekdotike Athenon, 1997. , p. 367. while on 20 November Greek troops from western Macedonia entered Kor√ß√´. However, Greek forces in the Epirote front had not the numbers to initiate an offensive against the German-designed defensive positions of Bizani that protected the city of Ioannina, and therefore had to wait for reinforcements from the Macedonian front.Albania's captives. Pyrros Ruches, Argonaut 1965, p. 65. After the campaign in Macedonia was over, a large part of the Army was redeployed to Epirus, where Crown Prince Constantine himself assumed command. In the Battle of Bizani the Ottoman positions were breached and Ioannina taken on . During the siege, on 8 February 1913, the Russian pilot N. de Sackoff, flying for the Greeks, became the first pilot ever shot down in combat, when his biplane was hit by ground fire following a bomb run on the walls of Fort Bizani. He came down near small town of Preveza, on the coast north of the Ionian island of Lefkas, secured local Greek assistance, repaired his plane and resumed flight back to base.Baker, David, \\"Flight and Flying: A Chronology\\", Facts On File, Inc., New York, New York, 1994, Library of Congress card number 92-31491, , page 61. The fall of Ioannina allowed the Greek army to continue its advance into northern Epirus, the southern part of modern Albania, which it occupied. There its advance stopped, although the Serbian line of control was very close to the north. Naval operations in the Aegean and Ionian seas The Greek fleet assembled at Phaleron Bay on 5/18 October 1912, before sailing for Lemnos On the outbreak of hostilities on 18 October, the Greek fleet, placed under the newly promoted Rear Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, sailed for the island of Lemnos, occupying it three days later (although fighting continued on the island until 27 October) and establishing an anchorage at Moudros Bay. This move was of major strategic importance, as it provided the Greeks with a forward base in close distance to the Dardanelles, the Ottoman fleet's main anchorage and refuge.Zisis Fotakis, Greek Naval Strategy and Policy 1910‚Äì1919 (2005), pp. 47‚Äì48Hall (2000), p. 64 In view of the Ottoman fleet's superiority in speed and broadside weight, the Greek planners expected it to sortie from the straits early in the war. Given the Greek fleet's unpreparedness resulting from the premature outbreak of the war, such an early Ottoman attack might well have been able to achieve a crucial victory. Instead, the Ottoman Navy spent the first two months of the war in operations against the Bulgarians in the Black Sea, giving the Greeks valuable time to complete their preparations and allowing them to consolidate their control of the Aegean.Fotakis (2005), pp. 46‚Äì48 By mid-November Greek naval detachments had seized the islands of Imbros, Thasos, Agios Efstratios, Samothrace, Psara and Ikaria, while landings were undertaken on the larger islands of Lesbos and Chios only on 21 and 27 November respectively. Substantial Ottoman garrisons were present on the latter, and their resistance was fierce. They withdrew into the mountainous interior and were not subdued until 22 December and 3 January respectively.Erickson (2003), pp. 157‚Äì158 Samos, officially an autonomous principality, was not attacked until 13 March 1913, out of a desire not to upset the Italians in the nearby Dodecanese. The clashes there were short-lived as the Ottoman forces withdrew to the Anatolian mainland so that the island was securely in Greek hands by 16 March.Erickson (2003), pp. 158‚Äì159 The torpedo boat Nikopolis, former Ottoman Antalya, captured at Preveza by the Greeks At the same time, with the aid of numerous merchant ships converted to auxiliary cruisers, a loose naval blockade on the Ottoman coasts from the Dardanelles to Suez was instituted, which disrupted the Ottomans' flow of supplies (only the Black Sea routes to Romania remained open) and left some 250,000 Ottoman troops immobilized in Asia.Zisis Fotakis, Greek Naval Strategy and Policy 1910‚Äì1919 (2005), pp. 48‚Äì49Langensiepen, Bernd, and Ahmet G√ºlery√ºz. The Ottoman Steam Navy, 1828‚Äì1923 (Conway Maritime Press, 1995), p. 19 In the Ionian Sea, the Greek fleet operated without opposition, ferrying supplies for the army units in the Epirus front. Furthermore, the Greeks bombarded and then blockaded the port of Vlor√´ in Albania on 3 December, and Durr√´s on 27 February. A naval blockade extending from the pre-war Greek border to Vlor√´ was also instituted on 3 December, isolating the newly established Provisional Government of Albania based there from any outside support.Hall (2000), pp. 65, 74 Lieutenant Nikolaos Votsis scored a major success for Greek morale on 31 October: he sailed his torpedo boat No. 11, under the cover of night, into the harbor of Thessaloniki, sank the old Ottoman ironclad battleship Feth-i B√ºlend and escaped unharmed. On the same day, Greek troops of the Epirus Army seized the Ottoman naval base of Preveza. The Ottomans scuttled the four ships present there, but the Greeks were able to salvage the Italian-built torpedo-boats Antalya and Tokat, which were commissioned into the Greek Navy as Nikopolis and Tatoi respectively.Langensiepen & G√ºlery√ºz (1995), pp. 19‚Äì20, 156 On 9 November, the wooden Ottoman armed steamer Trabzon was intercepted and sunk by the Greek torpedo boat No. 14 under Lt. Periklis Argyropoulos off Ayvalƒ±k. =Confrontations off the Dardanelles= The Naval Battle of Elli, oil painting by Vassileios Chatzis, 1913 The main Ottoman fleet remained inside the Dardanelles for the early part of the war, while the Greek destroyers continuously patrolled the Straits' exit to report on a possible sortie. Kountouriotis suggested mining the straits, but was not taken up for fear of international reactions.Fotakis (2005), p. 50 On 7 December, the head of the Ottoman fleet Tahir Bey was replaced by Ramiz Naman Bey, the leader of the hawkish faction among the officer corps. A new strategy was agreed, whereby the Ottomans were to take advantage of any absence of the Greek flagship Averof to attack the other Greek ships. The Ottoman staff formulated a plan to lure a number of the Greek destroyers on patrol into a trap. A first such effort on 12 December failed due to boiler trouble, but the second try two days later resulted in an indecisive engagement between the Greek destroyers and the cruiser Mecidiye.Langensiepen & G√ºlery√ºz (1995), pp. 21‚Äì22 The war's first major fleet action, the Naval Battle of Elli, was fought two days later, on . The Ottoman fleet, with four battleships, nine destroyers and six torpedo boats, sailed to the entrance of the straits. The lighter Ottoman vessels remained behind, but the battleship squadron moved on north under cover of the forts at Kumkale and engaged the Greek fleet, coming from Imbros, at 9:40. Leaving the older battleships behind, Kountouriotis led the Averof into independent action: utilizing its superior speed, it cut across the Ottoman fleet's bow. Under fire from two sides, the Ottomans were quickly forced to withdraw to the Dardanelles.Langensiepen & G√ºlery√ºz (1995), p. 22 The whole engagement lasted less than an hour, in which the Ottoman suffered heavy damage to the Barbaros Hayreddin and 18 dead and 41 wounded (most during their disorderly retreat) and the Greeks one dead and seven wounded.Langensiepen & G√ºlery√ºz (1995), pp. 22, 196 In the aftermath of Elli, on 20 December the energetic Lt. Commander Rauf Bey was placed in effective command of the Ottoman fleet. Two days later he led his forces out, hoping again to trap the patrolling Greek destroyers between two divisions of the Ottoman fleet, one heading for Imbros and the other waiting at the entrance of the straits. The plan failed as the Greek ships quickly broke contact, while at the same time the Mecidiye came under attack by the Greek submarine Delfin, which launched a torpedo against it but missed; the first such attack in history. During this time, the Ottoman Army continued to press upon a reluctant Navy a plan for the re-occupation of Tenedos, which the Greek destroyers used as a base, by an amphibious operation. The operation was scheduled for 4 January. On that day, weather conditions were ideal, and the fleet was ready, but the Yenihan regiment earmarked for the operation failed to arrive on time. The naval staff nevertheless ordered the fleet to sortie, and an engagement developed with the Greek fleet, without any significant results on either side.Langensiepen & G√ºlery√ºz (1995), pp. 22‚Äì23 Similar sorties followed on 10 and 11 January, but the results of these \\"cat and mouse\\" operations were always the same: \\"the Greek destroyers always managed to remain outside the Ottoman warships' range, and each time the cruisers fired a few rounds before breaking off the chase.\\"Langensiepen & G√ºlery√ºz (1995), p. 23 Hamidiye. Its exploits during its eight-month cruise through the Mediterranean were a major morale booster for the Ottomans. In preparation for the next attempt to break the Greek blockade, the Ottoman Admiralty decided to create a diversion by sending the light cruiser Hamidiye, captained by Rauf Bey, to raid Greek merchant shipping in the Aegean. It was hoped that the Averof, the only major Greek unit fast enough to catch the Hamidiye, would be drawn in pursuit and leave the remainder of the Greek fleet weakened.Langensiepen & G√ºlery√ºz (1995), p. 26 In the event, Hamidiye slipped through the Greek patrols on the night of 14‚Äì15 January and bombarded the harbor of the Greek island of Syros, sinking the Greek auxiliary cruiser Makedonia which lay in anchor there (it was later raised and repaired). The Hamidiye then left the Aegean for the Eastern Mediterranean, making stops at Beirut and Port Said before entering the Red Sea. Although providing a major morale boost for the Ottomans, the operation failed to achieve its primary objective, as Kountouriotis refused to leave his post and pursue the Hamidiye.Hall (2000), p. 65 Four days later, on , when the Ottoman fleet again sallied from the straits towards Lemnos, it was defeated for a second time in the Naval Battle of Lemnos. This time, the Ottoman warships concentrated their fire on the Averof, which again made use of its superior speed and tried to \\"cross the T\\" of the Ottoman fleet. Barbaros Hayreddin was again heavily damaged, and the Ottoman fleet was forced to return to the shelter of the Dardanelles and their forts. The Ottomans suffered 41 killed and 101 wounded.Langensiepen & G√ºlery√ºz (1995), pp. 23‚Äì24, 196 It was the last attempt of the Ottoman Navy to leave the Dardanelles, thereby leaving the Greeks dominant in the Aegean. On , a Greek Farman MF.7, piloted by Lt. Moutousis and with Ensign Moraitinis as an observer, carried out an aerial reconnaissance of the Ottoman fleet in its anchorage at Nagara, and launched four bombs on the anchored ships. Although it scored no hits, this operation is regarded as the first naval-air operation in military history. Crown Prince Constantine watching heavy artillery during the Battle of Bizani Poster celebrating the \\"New Hellas\\" after the Balkan Wars General Ivanov, commander of the 2nd Bulgarian Army, acknowledged the role of the Greek fleet in the overall Balkan League victory by stating that \\"the activity of the entire Greek fleet and above all the Averof was the chief factor in the general success of the allies\\". End of the War The Treaty of London ended the war, but no one was left satisfied, and soon, the four allies fell out over the partition of Macedonia. In June 1913, Bulgaria attacked Greece and Serbia, beginning the Second Balkan War, but was beaten back. The Treaty of Bucharest, which concluded the war, left Greece with southern Epirus, the southern-half of Macedonia, Crete and the Aegean islands, except for the Dodecanese, which had been occupied by Italy in 1911. These gains nearly doubled Greece's area and population. =1914‚Äì1924: World War I, crises, and the first abolition of the monarchy= Constantine I in a German Field Marshal's uniform. His pro-German sympathies caused him to favour a course of neutrality in the First World War. In March 1913, an anarchist, Alexandros Schinas, assassinated King George in Thessaloniki, and his son came to the throne as Constantine I. Constantine was the first Greek king born in Greece and the first to be Greek Orthodox. His very name had been chosen in the spirit of romantic Greek nationalism (the Megali Idea), evoking the Byzantine emperors of that name. Besides, as the Commander-in-chief of the Greek Army during the Balkan Wars, his popularity was enormous, rivalled only by that of Venizelos, his Prime Minister. When World War I broke out in 1914, despite Greece's treaty of alliance with Serbia, both leaders preferred to maintain a neutral stance. However, when, in early 1915, the Allied Powers asked for Greek help in the Dardanelles campaign, offering Cyprus in exchange, their diverging views became apparent: Constantine had been educated in Germany, was married to Sophia of Prussia, sister of Kaiser Wilhelm, and was convinced of the Central Powers' victory. Venizelos, on the other hand, was an ardent anglophile, and believed in an Allied victory. Macedonian front during the First World War, 1917. He is accompanied by Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis (left) and General Maurice Sarrail (right). Since Greece, a maritime country, could not oppose the mighty British navy, and citing the need for a respite after two wars, King Constantine favoured continued neutrality, while Venizelos actively sought Greek entry in the war on the Allied side. Venizelos resigned, but won the next elections, and again formed the government. When Bulgaria entered the war as a German ally in October 1915, Venizelos invited Entente forces into Greece (the Salonika Front), for which he was again dismissed by Constantine. In August 1916, after several incidents where both combatants encroached upon the still theoretically neutral Greek territory, Venizelist officers rose up in Allied-controlled Thessaloniki, and Venizelos established a separate government there. Constantine was now ruling only in what was Greece before the Balkan Wars (\\"Old Greece\\"), and his government was subject to repeated humiliations from the Allies. In November 1916 the French occupied Piraeus, bombarded Athens and forced the Greek fleet to surrender. The royalist troops fired at them, leading to a battle between French and Greek royalist forces. There were also riots against supporters of Venizelos in Athens (the Noemvriana).

His second son Alexander became King, while the remaining royal family and the most prominent royalists followed into exile. Venizelos now led a superficially united Greece into the war on the Allied side, but underneath the surface, the division of Greek society into Venizelists and anti-Venizelists, the so-called National Schism, became more entrenched. With the end of the war in November 1918, the moribund Ottoman Empire was ready to be carved up amongst the victors, and Greece now expected the Allied Powers to deliver on their promises. In no small measure through the diplomatic efforts of Venizelos, Greece secured Western Thrace in the Treaty of Neuilly in November 1919 and Eastern Thrace and a zone around Smyrna in western Anatolia (already under Greek administration since May 1919) in the Treaty of S√®vres of August 1920. The future of Constantinople was left to be determined. But at the same time, a nationalist movement had arisen in Turkey, led by Mustafa Kemal (later Kemal Atat√ºrk), who set up a rival government in Ankara and was engaged in fighting the Greek army. At this point, nevertheless, the fulfillment of the Megali Idea seemed near. Yet so deep was the rift in Greek society, that on his return to Greece, an assassination attempt was made on Venizelos by two former royalist officers. Even more surprisingly, Venizelos' Liberal Party lost the elections called in November 1920, and in a referendum shortly after, the Greek people voted for the return of King Constantine from exile, following the sudden death of Alexander. The United Opposition, which had campaigned on the slogan of an end to the war in Anatolia, instead intensified it. However, the royalist restoration had dire consequences: many veteran Venizelist officers were dismissed or left the army, while Italy and France found the return of the hated Constantine a useful pretext for switching their support to Kemal. Finally, in August 1922, the Turkish army shattered the Greek front, and took Smyrna. The Greek army evacuated not only Anatolia but also Eastern Thrace and the islands of Imbros and Tenedos (Treaty of Lausanne). A compulsory population exchange was agreed between the two countries, with over 1.5 million Christians and almost half a million Muslims being uprooted. This catastrophe marked the end of the Megali Idea, and left Greece financially exhausted, demoralised, and having to house and feed a proportionately huge number of refugees. The catastrophe deepened the political crisis, with the returning army rising under Venizelist officers and forcing King Constantine to abdicate again, in September 1922, in favour of his firstborn son, George II. The \\"Revolutionary Committee\\", headed by Colonels Stylianos Gonatas (soon to become Prime Minister) and Nikolaos Plastiras engaged in a witch-hunt against the royalists, culminating in the \\"Trial of the Six\\". In October 1923, elections were called for December, which would form a National Assembly with powers to draft a new constitution. Following a failed royalist coup, the monarchist parties abstained, leading to a landslide for the Liberals and their allies. King George II was asked to leave the country, and on 25 March 1924, Alexandros Papanastasiou proclaimed the Second Hellenic Republic, ratified by plebiscite a month later. =Restoration of Monarchy and the 4th of August Regime= Kondylis with George II in 1935 On 10 October 1935, a few months after he suppressed a Venizelist Coup in March 1935, Georgios Kondylis, the former Venizelist stalwart, abolished the Republic in another coup and declared the monarchy restored. A rigged plebiscite confirmed the regime change (with an unsurprising 97.88% of votes), and King George II returned. King George II immediately dismissed Kondylis and appointed Professor Konstantinos Demertzis as interim Prime Minister. Venizelos meanwhile, in exile, urged an end to the conflict over the monarchy given the threat to Greece from the rise of Fascist Italy. His successors as Liberal leader, Themistoklis Sophoulis and Georgios Papandreou, agreed, and the restoration of the monarchy was accepted. The 1936 elections resulted in a hung parliament, with the Communists holding the balance. As no government could be formed, Demertzis continued. At the same time, a series of deaths left the Greek political scene in disarray: Kondylis died in February, Venizelos in March, Demertzis in April and Tsaldaris in May. The road was now clear for Ioannis Metaxas, who had succeeded Demertzis as interim Prime Minister. Metaxas, a retired royalist general, believed that an authoritarian government was necessary to prevent social conflict and, especially, quell the rising power of the Communists. On 4 August 1936, with the King's support, he suspended parliament and established the 4th of August Regime. The Communists were suppressed and the Liberal leaders went into internal exile. Metaxas' regime promoted various concepts such as the \\"Third Hellenic Civilization\\", the Roman salute, a national youth organization, and introduced measures to gain popular support, such as the Greek Social Insurance Institute (IKA), still the biggest social security institution in Greece. Despite these efforts, the regime lacked a broad popular base or a mass movement supporting it. The Greek people were generally apathetic, without actively opposing Metaxas. Metaxas also improved the country's defences in preparation for the forthcoming European war, constructing, among other defensive measures, the \\"Metaxas Line\\". Despite his aping of Fascism and the strong economic ties with resurgent Nazi Germany, Metaxas followed a policy of neutrality, given Greece's traditionally strong ties to Britain, reinforced by King George II's personal Anglophilia. In April 1939, the Italian threat suddenly loomed closer, as Italy annexed Albania, whereupon Britain publicly guaranteed Greece's borders. Thus, when World War II broke out in September 1939, Greece remained neutral. =World War II= Ioannis Metaxas with King George II and Alexandros Papagos during a meeting of the Anglo-Greek War Council The three occupation zones.

George II during his visit to a Greek fighter station, 1944 Despite this declared neutrality, Greece became a target for Mussolini's expansionist policies. Provocations against Greece included the sinking of the light cruiser Elli on 15 August 1940. Italian troops crossed the border on 28 October 1940, beginning the Greco-Italian War, but were stopped by a determined Greek defence, and ultimately driven back into Albania. Metaxas died suddenly in January 1941. His death raised hopes of a liberalisation of his regime and the restoration of parliamentary rule, but King George quashed these hopes when he retained the regime's machinery in place. In the meantime, Adolf Hitler was reluctantly forced to divert German troops to rescue Mussolini from defeat, and attacked Greece through Yugoslavia and Bulgaria on 6 April 1941. Despite British assistance, by the end of May, the Germans had overrun most of the country. The King and the government escaped to Crete, where they stayed until the end of the Battle of Crete. They then transferred to Egypt, where a government in exile was established. The occupied country was divided into three zones (German, Italian and Bulgarian) and in Athens, a puppet regime was established. The members were either conservatives or nationalists with fascist leanings. The three quisling prime ministers were Georgios Tsolakoglou, the general who had signed the armistice with the Wehrmacht, Konstantinos Logothetopoulos, and Ioannis Rallis, who took office when the German defeat was inevitable, and aimed primarily at combating the left-wing Resistance movement. To this end, he created the collaborationist Security Battalions. Greece suffered terrible privations during World War II, as the Germans appropriated most of the country's agricultural production and prevented its fishing fleets from operating. As a result, and because a British blockade initially hindered foreign relief efforts, a wide-scale famine resulted, when hundreds of thousands perished, especially in the winter of 1941‚Äì1942. In the mountains of the Greek mainland, in the meantime, several resistance movements sprang up, and by mid-1943, the Axis forces controlled only the main towns and the connecting roads, while a \\"Free Greece\\" was set up in the mountains. The largest resistance group, the National Liberation Front (EAM), was controlled by the Communists, as was (ELAS) led by Aris Velouchiotis and a civil war soon broke out between it and non-Communist groups such as the National Republican Greek League (EDES) in those areas liberated from the Germans. The exiled government in Cairo was only intermittently in touch with the resistance movement, and exercised virtually no influence in the occupied country. Part of this was due to the unpopularity of the King George II in Greece itself, but despite efforts by Greek politicians, British support ensured his retention at the head of the Cairo government. As the German defeat drew nearer, the various Greek political factions convened in Lebanon in May 1944, under British auspices, and formed a government of national unity, under George Papandreou, in which EAM was represented by six ministers. =Greek Civil War (1946‚Äì49)= German forces withdrew on 12 October 1944, and the government in exile returned to Athens. After the German withdrawal, the EAM-ELAS guerrilla army effectively controlled most of Greece, but its leaders were reluctant to take control of the country, as they knew that Stalin had agreed that Greece would be in the British sphere of influence after the war. Tensions between the British-backed Papandreou and EAM, especially over the issue of disarmament of the various armed groups, leading to the resignation of the latter's ministers from the government. A few days later, on 3 December 1944, a large-scale pro-EAM demonstration in Athens ended in violence and ushered an intense, house-to- house struggle with British and monarchist forces (the Dekemvriana). After three weeks, the Communists were defeated: the Varkiza agreement ended the conflict and disarmed ELAS, and an unstable coalition government was formed. The anti-EAM backlash grew into a full-scale \\"White Terror\\", which exacerbated tensions. The Communists boycotted the March 1946 elections, and on the same day, fighting broke out again. By the end of 1946, the Communist Democratic Army of Greece had been formed, pitted against the governmental National Army, which was backed first by Britain and after 1947 by the United States. Communist successes in 1947‚Äì1948 enabled them to move freely over much of mainland Greece, but with the extensive reorganisation, the deportation of rural populations and American material support, the National Army was slowly able to regain control over most of the countryside. In 1949, the insurgents suffered a major blow, as Yugoslavia closed its borders following the split between Marshal Josip Broz Tito with the Soviet Union. In August 1949, the National Army under Marshal Alexander Papagos launched an offensive that forced the remaining insurgents to surrender or flee across the northern border into the territory of Greece's northern Communist neighbours. The civil war resulted in 100,000 killed and caused catastrophic economic disruption. Moreover, at least 25,000 Greeks were either voluntarily or forcibly evacuated to Eastern bloc countries, while 700,000 became displaced persons inside the country. Many more emigrated to Australia and other countries. The postwar settlement saw Greece's territorial expansion, which had begun in 1832, come to an end. The 1947 Treaty of Paris required Italy to hand over the Dodecanese islands to Greece. These were the last majority-Greek-speaking areas to be united with the Greek state, apart from Cyprus which was a British possession until it became independent in 1960. Greece's ethnic homogeneity was increased by the postwar expulsion of 25,000 Albanians from Epirus (see Cham Albanians). The only significant remaining minorities are the Muslims in Western Thrace (about 100,000) and a small Slavic-speaking minority in the north. Greek nationalists continued to claim southern Albania (which they called Northern Epirus), home of a significant Greek population (about 3%‚Äì12% in the whole of Albania), and the Turkish-held islands of Imvros and Tenedos, where there were smaller Greek minorities. =Postwar Greece and the fall of the monarchy (1950‚Äì1973)= Paul of Greece with his wife Frederica Royal standard (1936‚Äì1973) During the Civil war (1946‚Äì49) but even more after that, the parties in the parliament were divided into three political concentrations. The political formation Right-Centre-Left, given the exacerbation of political animosity that had preceded dividing the country in the 1940s, tended to turn the concurrence of parties into ideological positions. At the beginning of the 1950s, the forces of the Centre (EPEK) succeeded in gaining the power and under the leadership of the aged general Nikolaos Plastiras they governed for about half a four-year term. These were a series of governments having limited manoeuvre ability and inadequate influence in the political arena. This government, as well as those that followed, was constantly under the American auspices. The defeat of EPEK in the elections of 1952, apart from increasing the repressive measures that concerned the defeated of the Civil war, also marked the end of the general political position that it represented, namely political consensus and social reconciliation. The Left, which had been ostracised from the political life of the country, found a way of expression through the constitution of EDA (United Democratic Left) in 1951, which turned out to be a significant pole, yet steadily excluded from the decision making centres. After the disbandment of the Centre as an autonomous political institution, EDA practically expanded its electoral influence to a significant part of the EAM-based Centre-Left. Athens in the 1950s Government House) The 1960s are part of the period 1953‚Äì72, during which Greek economy developed rapidly and was structured within the scope of European and worldwide economic developments. One of the key features of that period was the major political event of the country's accession to the EEC, in an attempt to create a common market. The relevant treaty was contracted in 1962. The developmental strategy adopted by the country was embodied in centrally organised five-year plans; yet their orientation was indistinct. The average annual emigration, which absorbed the excess workforce and contributed to extremely high growth rates, exceeded the annual natural increase in population. The influx of large amounts of foreign private capital was being facilitated, and consumption was expanded. These, associated with the rise of tourism, the expansion of shipping activity and with the migrant remittances, had a positive effect on the balance of payments. The peak of development was registered principally in manufacture, mainly in the textile and chemical industry and in the sector of metallurgy, the growth rate of which tended to reach 11% during 1965‚Äì70. The other large branch where distinct economic and social consequences were brought about, was that of construction. Consideration, a Greek invention, favoured the creation of a class of small-medium contractors on the one hand and settled the housing system and property status on the other. During that decade, youth came forth in society as a distinct social power with the autonomous presence (creation of a new culture in music, fashion, etc.) and displaying dynamism in the assertion of their social rights. The independence granted to Cyprus, which was mined from the very beginning, constituted the primary focus of young activist mobilisations, along with struggles aiming at reforms in education, which were provisionally realised to a certain extent through the educational reform of 1964. The country reckoned on and was influenced by Europe ‚Äì usually behind time ‚Äì and by the current trends like never before. Thus, in a sense, the imposition of the military junta conflicted with the social and cultural occurrences. The country descended into a prolonged political crisis, and elections were scheduled for late April 1967. On 21 April 1967 however, a group of right-wing colonels led by Colonel Georgios Papadopoulos seized power in a coup d'√©tat establishing the Regime of the Colonels. Civil liberties were suppressed, special military courts were established, and political parties were dissolved. Several thousand suspected communists and political opponents were imprisoned or exiled to remote Greek islands. Alleged US support for the junta is claimed to be the cause of rising anti-Americanism in Greece during and following the junta's harsh rule. However, the junta's early years also saw a marked upturn in the economy, with increased foreign investment and large-scale infrastructure works. The junta was widely condemned abroad, but inside the country, discontent began to increase only after 1970, when the economy slowed down. Even the armed forces, the regime's foundation, were not immune. In May 1973, a planned coup by the Hellenic Navy was narrowly suppressed but led to the mutiny of the , whose officers sought political asylum in Italy. In response, junta leader Papadopoulos attempted to steer the regime towards a controlled democratization, abolishing the monarchy and declaring himself President of the Republic. Politics =Greek Monarchical Constitutions= The first constitution of the Kingdom of Greece was the Greek Constitution of 1844. On 3 September 1843, the military garrison of Athens, with the help of citizens, rebelled and demanded from King Otto the concession of a Constitution. Dimitrios Kallergis on horseback during the 3 September 1843 Revolution The Old Parliament House, Athens The Constitution that was proclaimed in March 1844 came from the workings of the \\"Third of September National Assembly of the Hellenes in Athens\\" and was a Constitutional Pact, in other words, a contract between the monarch and the Nation. This Constitution re-established the Constitutional Monarchy and was based on the French Constitution of 1830 and the Belgian Constitution of 1831. Its main provisions were the following: It established the principle of monarchical sovereignty, as the monarch was the decisive power of the State; the legislative power was to be exercised by the King ‚Äì who also had the right to ratify the laws ‚Äì by the Parliament, and by the Senate. The members of the Parliament could be no less than 80, and they were elected for a three-year term by universal suffrage. The senators were appointed for life by the King, and their number was set at 27, although that figure could increase should the need arise and per the monarch's will, but it could not exceed half the number of the members of Parliament. The ministers' responsibility for the King's actions is established, who also appoints and removes them. Justice stems from the King and is dispensed in his name by the judges he himself appoints. Lastly, this Assembly voted the electoral law of 18 March 1844, which was the first European law to provide, in essence, for universal male suffrage. The Second National Assembly of the Hellenes took place in Athens (1863‚Äì1864) and dealt both with the election of a new sovereign as well as with the drafting of a new Constitution, thereby implementing the transition from constitutional monarchy to a Crowned republic. Following the refusal of Prince Alfred of Great Britain (who was elected by an overwhelming majority in the first referendum of the country in November 1862) to accept the crown of the Greek kingdom, the government offered the crown to the Danish prince George Christian Willem of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Gluecksburg, who was crowned constitutional King of Greece under the name \\"George I, King of the Hellenes\\". The Constitution of 1864 was drafted following the models of the Constitutions of Belgium of 1831 and of Denmark of 1849, and established in clear terms the principle of popular sovereignty, since the only legislative body with reversionary powers was now the Parliament. Furthermore, article 31 reiterated that all the powers stemmed from the Nation and were to be exercised as provided by the Constitution, while article 44 established the principle of accountability, taking into consideration that the King only possessed the powers that were bestowed on him by the Constitution and by the laws applying the same. The Assembly chose the system of a single chamber Parliament (Vouli) with a four- year term, and hence abolished the Senate, which many accused of being a tool in the hands of the monarchy. Direct, secret and universal elections were adopted as the manner to elect the MPs, while elections were to be held simultaneously throughout the entire nation. Additionally, article 71 introduced a conflict between being an MP and a salaried public employee or mayor at the same time, but not with serving as an army officer. The Constitution reiterated various clauses found in the Constitution of 1844, such as that the King appoints and dismisses the ministers and that the latter are responsible for the person of the monarch, but it also allowed for the Parliament to establish \\"examination committees\\". Moreover, the King preserved the right to convoke the Parliament in ordinary as well as in extraordinary sessions, and to dissolve it at his discretion, provided, however, that the dissolution decree was also countersigned by the Cabinet. The Constitution repeated verbatim the clause of article 24 of the Constitution of 1844, according to which \\"The King appoints and removes his Ministers\\". This phrase insinuated that the ministers were practically subordinate to the monarch, and thereby answered not only to the Parliament but to him as well. Moreover, nowhere was it stated in the Constitution that the King was obliged to appoint the Cabinet in conformity with the will of the majority in Parliament. This was, however, the interpretation that the modernizing political forces of the land upheld, invoking the principle of popular sovereignty and the spirit of the Parliamentary regime. The Old Royal Palace in Athens has hosted the Hellenic Parliament since 1929. They finally succeeded in imposing it through the principle of \\"manifest confidence\\" of the Parliament, which was expressed in 1875 by Charilaos Trikoupis and which, that same year, in his Crown Speech, King George I expressly pledged to uphold: \\"I demand as a prerequisite, of all that I call beside me to assist me in governing the country, to possess the manifest confidence and trust of the majority of the Nation's representatives. Furthermore, I accept this approval to stem from the Parliament, as without it the harmonious functioning of the polity would be impossible\\". The establishment of the principle of \\"manifest confidence\\" towards the end of the first decade of the crowned democracy, contributed towards the disappearance of a constitutional practice which, in many ways, reiterated the negative experiences of the period of the reign of King Otto. Indeed, from 1864 through 1875 numerous elections of dubious validity had taken place, while, additionally and most importantly, there was an active involvement of the Throne in political affairs through the appointment of governments enjoying a minority in Parliament, or through the forced resignation of majority governments, when their political views clashed with those of the crown. The Greek Constitution of 1911 was a major step forward in the constitutional history of Greece. Following the rise to power of Eleftherios Venizelos after the Goudi revolt in 1909, Venizelos set about attempting to reform the state. The main outcome of this was a major revision to the Greek Constitution of 1864. The most noteworthy amendments to the Constitution of 1864 concerning the protection of human rights, were the more effective protection of personal security, equality in tax burdens, of the right to assemble and of the inviolability of the domicile. Furthermore, the Constitution facilitated expropriation to allocate property to landless farmers, while simultaneously judicially protecting property rights. Other important changes included the institution of an Electoral Court for the settlement of election disputes stemming from the parliamentary elections, the addition of new conflicts for MPs, the re-establishment of the State Council as the highest administrative court (which, however, was constituted and operated only under the Constitution of 1927), the improvement of the protection of judicial independence and the establishment of the non-removability of public employees. Finally, for the first time, the Constitution provided for mandatory and free education for all, and declared Katharevousa (i.e. archaising \\"purified\\" Greek) as the \\"official language of the Nation\\". Economy =19th century= Greece entered its period of new-won independence in a somewhat different state than Serbia, which shared many of the post-independence economic problems such as land reform. In 1833, the Greeks took control of a countryside devastated by war, depopulated in places and hampered by primitive agriculture and marginal soils. Just as in Serbia, communications were bad, presenting obstacles for any wider foreign commerce. Even by the late 19th-century Agricultural development had not advanced as significantly as had been intended as William Moffet, the US Consul in Athens explained: \\"agriculture is here in the most undeveloped condition. Even in the immediate neighbourhood of Athens, it is common to find the wooden plough and the rude mattock which were in use 2,000 years ago. Fields are ploughed up or scratched over, and crops replanted season after season until the exhausted soil will bear no more. Fertilizers are not used to any appreciable extent, and the farm implements are of the very rudest description. Irrigation is in use in some districts, and, as far as I can ascertain, the methods in use can be readily learned by a study of the practices of the ancient Egyptians. Greece has olives and grapes in abundance, and of quality not excelled, but Greek olive oil and Greek wine will not bear transportation.\\" Greece had a strong wealthy commercial class of rural notables and island shipowners, and access to of land expropriated from Muslim owners who had been driven off during the War of Independence. Land reform Construction of the Athens-Piraeus highway by army engineers, 1835‚Äì36 Land reform represented the first real test for the new Greek kingdom. The new Greek government deliberately adopted land reforms intended to create a class of free peasants. The \\"Law for the Dotation of Greek Families\\" of 1835 extended 2,000 drachmas credit to every family, to be used to buy a farm at auction under a low-cost loan plan. The country was full of displaced refugees and empty Ottoman estates. By a series of land reforms over several decades, the government distributed this confiscated land among veterans and the poor, so that by 1870 most Greek peasant families owned about . These farms were too small for prosperity, but the land reform signalled the goal of a society in which Greeks were equals and could support themselves, instead of working for hire on the estates of the rich. The class basis of rivalry between Greek factions was thereby reduced. Raisin (dried grapes) exporting in the port of Patras, late 19th century =20th century= Industry The series of wars between 1912 and 1922 provided a catalyst for Greek industry, with a number of industries such as textiles; ammunition and boot-making springing up to supply the military. After the wars most of these industries were converted to civilian uses. Greek refugees from Asia Minor, the most famous of which was Aristotle Onassis who hails from Smyrna (modern Izmir) also had a tremendous impact on the evolution of Greek industry and banking. Greeks held 45% of the capital in the Ottoman Empire before 1914,Issawi, Charles, The Economic History of the Middle East and North Africa, Columbia University Press 1984 and many of the refugees expelled from Turkey had funds and skills which they quickly put to use in Greece. These refugees from Asia Minor also led to rapid growth of urban areas in Greece, as the vast majority of them settled in urban centres such as Athens and Thessaloniki. The 1920 census reported that 36.3% of Greeks lived in urban or semi-urban areas, while the 1928 census reported that 45.6% of Greeks lived in urban or semi-urban areas. It has been argued by many Greek economists that these refugees kept Greek industry competitive during the 1920s, as the surplus of labour kept real wages very low. Although this thesis makes economic sense, it is sheer speculation as there is no reliable data on wages and prices in Greece during this period.Freris, A. F., The Greek Economy in the Twentieth Century, St. Martin's Press 1986 Greek industry went into decline slightly before the country joined the EC, and this trend continued. Although worker productivity rose significantly in Greece, labour costs increased too fast for the Greek manufacturing industry to remain competitive in Europe. There was also very little modernization in Greek industries due to a lack of financing.Elisabeth Oltheten, George Pinteras, and Theodore Sougiannis, \\"Greece in the European Union: policy lessons from two decades of membership\\", The Quarterly Review of Economics and Finance Winter 2003 Dichotomization of the drachma Budgetary problems caused the Greek government to begin an interesting economic experiment, the dichotomization of the drachma. Unable to secure any more loans from abroad to finance the war with Turkey, in 1922 Finance Minister Protopapadakis declared that each drachma was essentially to be cut in half. Half of the value of the drachma would be kept by the owner, and the other half would be surrendered by the government in exchange for a 20-year 6.5% loan. World War II led to these loans not being repaid, but even if the war had not occurred, it is doubtful that the Greek government would have been able to repay such enormous debts to its own populace. This strategy led to large revenues for the Greek state, and inflation effects were minimal. This strategy was repeated again in 1926 due to the government's inability to pay back loans incurred from the decade of war and the resettlement of the refugees. Deflation occurred after this dichotomization of the drachma, as well as a rise in interest rates. These policies had the effect of causing much of the populace to lose faith in their government, and investment decreased as people began to stop holding their assets in cash which had become unstable, and began holding real goods. Great Depression As the reverberations of the Great Depression hit Greece in 1932. The Bank of Greece tried to adopt deflationary policies to stave off the crises that were going on in other countries, but these largely failed. For a brief period, the drachma was pegged to the US dollar, but this was unsustainable given the country's large trade deficit, and the only long- term effects of this were Greece's foreign exchange reserves being almost totally wiped out in 1932. Remittances from abroad declined sharply and the value of the drachma began to plummet from 77 drachmas to the dollar in March 1931 to 111 drachmas to the dollar in April, 1931. This has been particularly harmful to Greece as the country relied on imports from the UK, France and the Middle East for many necessities. Greece went off the gold standard in April 1932 and declared a moratorium on all interest payments. The country also adopted protectionist policies such as import quotas, which some European countries did during the time period. Protectionist policies coupled with a weak drachma, stifling imports, allowed Greek industry to expand during the Great Depression. In 1939 Greek Industrial output was 179% that of 1928. These industries were for the most part \\"built on sand\\" as one report of the Bank of Greece put it, as without massive protection they would not have been able to survive. Despite the global depression, Greece managed to suffer comparatively little, averaging an average growth rate of 3.5% from 1932 to 1939. The fascist regime of Yannis Metaxas took over the Greek government in 1936, and economic growth was strong in the years leading up to the Second World War. Shipping One industry in which Greece had major success was the shipping industry. Greece's geography has made the country a major player in maritime affairs from antiquity, and Greece has a strong modern tradition dating from the treaty of Kuchuk-Kajnardji in 1774, which allowed Greek ships to escape Ottoman domination by registering under the Russian flag. The treaty prompted a number of Greek commercial houses to be set up across the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, and after independence, Greece's shipping industry was one of the few bright spots in the modern Greek economy during the 19th century. After both world wars the Greek shipping industry was hit hard by the decline in global trade, but both times it revived quickly. The Greek government aided the revival of the Greek shipping industry with insurance promises following the Second World War. Tycoons such as Aristotle Onassis also aided in strengthening the Greek merchant fleet, and shipping has remained one of the few sectors in which Greece still excels. Tourism Xenia Hotel at Paliouri, Chalkidice, 1962 It was during the 60s and 70s that tourism, which now accounts for 30% of Greece's GDP, began to become a major earner of foreign exchange. This was initially opposed by many in the Greek government, as it was seen as a volatile source of income in the event of any political shocks. It was also opposed by many conservatives and by the Church as bad for the country's morals. Despite concerns, tourism grew significantly in Greece and was encouraged by successive governments as it was a straightforward source of badly needed foreign exchange revenues. Agriculture The resolution of the Greco-Turkish War and the Treaty of Lausanne led to a population exchange between Greece and Turkey, which also had massive ramifications on the agricultural sector in Greece. The tsifliks were abolished, and Greek refugees from Asia Minor settled on these abandoned and partitioned estates. In 1920 only 4% of land holdings were of sizes more than , and only .3% of these were in large estates of more than . This pattern of small scale farm ownership has continued to the present day, with the small number of larger farms declining slightly. Post-World War II Workmen grading the street in front of new housing constructed with the help of Marshall Plan funds Greece suffered comparatively much more than most Western European countries during the Second World War due to a number of factors. Heavy resistance led to immense German reprisals against civilians. Greece was also dependent on food imports, and a British naval blockade coupled with transfers of agricultural produce to Germany resulted in famine. It is estimated that the Greek population declined by 7% during the Second World War. Greece experienced hyperinflation during the war. In 1943, prices were 34,864% higher compared to those of 1940; in 1944, prices were 163,910,000,000% higher compared to the 1940 prices. The Greek hyperinflation is the fifth worst in economic history, after Hungary's following World War II, Zimbabwe's in the late 2000s, Yugoslavia's in the middle 1990s, and Germany's following World War I. This was compounded by the country's disastrous civil war from 1944 to 1950. Greek economy was in a deplorable state in 1950 (after the end of the Civil War), with its relative position dramatically affected. In that year Greece had a per capita GDP of $1,951, which was well below that of countries like Portugal ($2,132), Poland ($2,480), and even Mexico ($2,085). Greece's per capita GDP was comparable to that of countries like Bulgaria ($1,651), Japan ($1,873), or Morocco ($1,611). Over the past 50 years, Greece has grown much faster than most of the countries that had comparable per capita GDP's in 1950, reaching a per capita GDP of $30,603 today. This can be compared to the previously stated countries, $17,900 in Portugal, $12,000 in Poland, $9,600 in Mexico, $8,200 in Bulgaria and $4,200 in Morocco. Greece's growth averaged 7% between 1950 and 1973, a rate second only to Japan's during the same period. In 1950 Greece was ranked 28th in the world for per capita GDP, while in 1970 it was ranked 20th. Culture =Visual arts= Modern Greek art began to be developed around the time of Romanticism. Greek artists absorbed many elements from their European colleagues, resulting in the culmination of the distinctive style of Greek Romantic art, inspired by revolutionary ideals as well as the country's geography and history. The most important artistic movement of Greek painting in the 19th century was academic realism (Greek academic art of the 19th century), often called in Greece \\"the Munich School\\" because of the strong influence from the Royal Academy of Fine Arts of Munich (),Bank of Greece ‚Äì Events where many Greek artists trained. The Munich School painted the same sort of scenes in the same sort of style as Western European academic painters in several countries and did not attempt to incorporate Byzantine stylistic elements into their work. The creation of romantic art in Greece can be explained mainly due to the particular relationships that were created between recently liberated Greece (1830) and Bavaria during King Otto's years. Notable sculptors of the new Greek Kingdom were Leonidas Drosis whose major work was the extensive neo-classical architectural ornament at the Academy of Athens, Lazaros Sochos, Georgios Vitalis, Dimitrios Filippotis, Ioannis Kossos, Yannoulis Chalepas, Georgios Bonanos and Lazaros Fytalis. =Theatre= The National Theatre of Greece, formerly known as the Royal Theatre, in Athens The Royal Theatre (Vasiliko Theatro) in Thessaloniki The modern Greek theatre was born after the Greek independence, in the early 19th century, and initially was influenced by the Heptanesean theatre and melodrama, such as the Italian opera. The Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corf√π was the first theatre and opera house of modern Greece and the place where the first Greek opera, Spyridon Xyndas' The Parliamentary Candidate (based on an exclusively Greek libretto) was performed. During the late 19th and early 20th century, the Athenian theatre scene was dominated by revues, musical comedies, operettas and nocturnes and notable playwrights included Spyridon Samaras, Dionysios Lavrangas, Theophrastos Sakellaridis and others. The National Theatre of Greece was founded in 1880. Notable playwrights of the modern Greek theatre include Gregorios Xenopoulos, Nikos Kazantzakis, Pantelis Horn, Alekos Sakellarios and Iakovos Kambanelis, while notable actors include Cybele Andrianou, Marika Kotopouli, Aimilios Veakis, Orestis Makris, Katina Paxinou, Manos Katrakis and Dimitris Horn. Significant directors include Dimitris Rontiris, Alexis Minotis and Karolos Koun. =Cinema= Cinema first appeared in Greece in 1896 at the Summer Olympics, but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907. In 1914 the Asty Films Company was founded and the production of long films begun. Golfo (ŒìŒ∫œåŒªœÜœâ), a well known traditional love story, is the first Greek long movie, although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931 Orestis Laskos directed Daphnis and Chloe (ŒîŒ¨œÜŒΩŒπœÇ Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒßŒªœåŒ∑), contained the first nude scene in the history of European cinema; it was also the first Greek movie which was played abroad. In 1944 Katina Paxinou was honoured with the Best Supporting Actress Academy Award for For Whom the Bell Tolls. The 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many as the Greek Golden age of Cinema. Directors and actors of this era were recognized as important historical figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: Mihalis Kakogiannis, Alekos Sakellarios, Melina Mercouri, Nikos Tsiforos, Iakovos Kambanelis, Katina Paxinou, Nikos Koundouros, Ellie Lambeti, Irene Papas etc. More than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having film noir elements. Notable films were Œó Œ∫Œ¨ŒªœÄŒπŒ∫Œ∑ ŒªŒØœÅŒ± (1955 directed by Giorgos Tzavellas), Œ†ŒπŒ∫œÅœå Œ®œâŒºŒØ (1951, directed by Grigoris Grigoriou), O Drakos (1956 directed by Nikos Koundouros), Stella (1955 directed by Cacoyannis and written by Kampanellis). Cacoyannis also directed Zorba the Greek with Anthony Quinn which received Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film nominations. Finos Film also contributed to this period with movies such as ŒõŒ±œÑŒ≠œÅŒΩŒ±, Œ¶œÑœéœáŒµŒπŒ± Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ¶ŒπŒªœåœÑŒπŒºŒø, Œó ŒòŒµŒØŒ± Œ±œÄœå œÑŒø Œ£ŒπŒ∫Œ¨Œ≥Œø, Œ§Œø ŒæœçŒªŒø Œ≤Œ≥ŒÆŒ∫Œµ Œ±œÄœå œÑŒøŒΩ Œ†Œ±œÅŒ¨Œ¥ŒµŒπœÉŒø and many more.

Directed by filmmaker Grant McPhee, the film‚Äôs name is taken from the 1981 Fire Engines single of the same name, the final release on the Pop Aural label. The film won the 2015 Edinburgh International Film Festival Audience Award.  Overview  Using a combination of interviews, archive material and specially-shot footage, the film traces the development of a post-punk scene in Scotland, tracing its roots in the punk explosion of 1977 and its effect on the Edinburgh music scene, with the emergence of bands such as Scars and The Dirty Reds and the appearance of record label Fast Product, which went on to release records by The Human League, The Mekons, Joy Division and Gang of Four. The film goes on to chart (and contrast) the rise and fall of Glasgow's poppier Postcard Records, home to Orange Juice and east-coast defectors, Josef K. While primarily regarded as a music documentary, McPhee has stated that he sees Big Gold Dream as a study of creative autonomy and DIY culture: ‚ÄúDespite its billing, this film is not a history of Scottish punk or independent music. It‚Äôs not really even that much about Scotland. It‚Äôs about young people taking control and expressing themselves creatively, without seeking permission from anyone in authority first ‚Äì it just happens that those young people in our films chose post-punk music.‚Äù  Production  Big Gold Dream took nine years to produce, with the first interviews filmed in 2006. McPhee attributes this to a dearth of available resources, stating that \\"in the early days things moved very slowly, equipment and time were expensive so we had to save up for a while to do each interview ‚Äì and that was frustrating. Even a dozen interviews could take a couple of years.\\" So much footage was captured over this period that a second documentary, Teenage Superstars, followed, following the story of the Scottish music scene from the mid-eighties to early nineties, including interviews with Teenage Fanclub's Norman Blake and Eugene Kelly of The Vaselines.  Release  Big Gold Dream premiered at the Edinburgh International Film Festival on 19 June 2015, going on to show at Raindance, Belfast Film Festival, Leeds International Film Festival, Doc'n Roll Film Festival and Cambridge Film Festival. It was also included in the schedules of music festivals including The Great Escape, Indiepop NYC and Electric Fields. Big Gold Dream received a television premiere on BBC Two on 15 April 2016.

Family background Gu Cheng's ancestral home was in Wu County, Wu Commandery, which is present-day Suzhou, Jiangsu.(... Âê≥ÈÉ°Âê≥‰∫∫‰πü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 52. The Gu clan, which he was from, was one of the four most influential clans in Wu Commandery and also in the Jiangdong region at the time. Gu Cheng's father, Gu Shao, served as the Administrator (Â§™ÂÆà) of Yuzhang Commandery (Ë±´Á´†ÈÉ°; around present- day Nanchang, Jiangxi) under the warlord Sun Quan in the late Eastern Han dynasty. Gu Cheng's grandfather, Gu Yong, was the second Imperial Chancellor of the state of Eastern Wu, founded by Sun Quan in the Three Kingdoms period after the fall of the Eastern Han dynasty. Gu Cheng's mother was a sister of Lu Mao and Lu Xun, the third Imperial Chancellor of Eastern Wu. Life Gu Cheng started his career in the Jiahe era (232‚Äì238) of Sun Quan's reign when he, along with his maternal uncle Lu Mao, were offered positions in the Eastern Wu government.([È°ß]ÊâøÂ≠óÂ≠êÁõ¥ÔºåÂòâÁ¶æ‰∏≠ËàáËàÖÈô∏ÁëÅ‰ø±‰ª•Á¶ÆÂæµ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 52.

During this time, he joined the Wu general Zhuge Ke in pacifying the rebellious Shanyue tribes and succeeded in recruiting 8,000 elite troops from among the Shanyue.

In the summer of 241, the Wu general Quan Cong led Wu forces into battle at Quebei (ËäçÈôÇ; south of present-day Shou County, Anhui) against Wei forces led by Wang Ling. The battle did not go well for the Wu side initially, and they lost five units to the Wei forces. Gu Cheng and his friend Zhang Xiu, who were serving in the Wu army at the time, led their units to resist the Wei forces and managed to halt their advance. Quan Cong's eldest son Quan Xu (ÂÖ®Á∑í) and relative Quan Duan (ÂÖ®Á´Ø), who were also serving in the Wu army, led their troops to attack the Wei forces after they stopped advancing, and succeeded in driving them back.(ÂÖàÊòØÔºåË≠öÂºüÊâøËàáÂºµ‰ºë‰ø±ÂåóÂæÅÂ£ΩÊò•ÔºåÂÖ®ÁêÆÊôÇÁÇ∫Â§ßÈÉΩÁù£ÔºåËàáÈ≠èÂ∞áÁéãÊ∑©Êà∞ÊñºËäçÈôÇÔºåËªç‰∏çÂà©ÔºåÈ≠èÂÖµ‰πòÂãùÈô∑Ê≤í‰∫îÁáüÂ∞áÁß¶ÊôÉËªçÔºå‰ºë„ÄÅÊâøÂ•ÆÊìä‰πã„ÄÇÈÅÇÈßêÈ≠èÂ∏´„ÄÇÊôÇÁêÆÁæ£Â≠êÁ∑í„ÄÅÁ´Ø‰∫¶‰∏¶ÁÇ∫Â∞áÔºåÂõ†ÊïµÊó£‰ΩèÔºå‰πÉÈÄ≤Êìä‰πãÔºåÊ∑©ËªçÁî®ÈÄÄ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 52. After the battle, when Sun Quan was giving rewards to his officers, he deemed Gu Cheng and Zhang Xiu's contributions greater than those of Quan Xu and Quan Duan because he believed that it was more difficult to halt the enemy advance than to drive back the enemy. As a result, he promoted Gu Cheng and Zhang Xiu to the rank of General, while Quan Xu and Quan Duan were respectively promoted to Lieutenant-General and Major-General only. Due to this incident, the Quans bore a grudge against Gu Cheng and Zhang Xiu and, by extension, against Gu Cheng's brother Gu Tan as well.(ÊôÇË´ñÂäüË°åË≥ûÔºå‰ª•ÁÇ∫ÈßêÊïµ‰πãÂäüÂ§ßÔºåÈÄÄÊïµ‰πãÂäüÂ∞èÔºå‰ºë„ÄÅÊâø‰∏¶ÁÇ∫ÈõúËôüÂ∞áËªçÔºåÁ∑í„ÄÅÁ´ØÂÅèË£®ËÄåÂ∑≤„ÄÇÂØÑÁà∂Â≠êÁõäÊÅ®Ôºå ...)

As a result, Gu Cheng and Zhang Xiu were arrested and thrown into prison, while Gu Cheng's brother Gu Tan was implicated in the case because of his relationship with them.

During an imperial court session, Sun Quan ordered Gu Tan to publicly apologise for the mistake. He expected Gu Tan to do so, after which he could then pardon and release the three of them.

The actor relocated to Sydney from Melbourne upon being offered the role. He began filming his first scenes in early December 2015. Pledger made his first appearance as Mason during the episode broadcast on 7 June 2016. Mason was introduced to the show along with his three older siblings; Tori Morgan (Penny McNamee), Justin Morgan (James Stewart) and Brody Morgan (Jackson Heywood). Mason is portrayed as being a positive, family orientated \\"free spirit\\". He is studying to be a doctor like his sister, who he shares a close bond with. For the first few weeks after their arrival, Mason and his siblings concealed the fact that they were in witness protection. Mason was the first member of the family to reveal the secret, which resulted in them being held hostage. Subsequent storylines for Mason have revolved around his romantic relationships with Evelyn MacGuire (Phillipa Northeast), Olivia Fraser Richards (Raechelle Banno), and Beth Ellis (Anneliese Apps), with the latter helping to bring awareness to organ donation in Australia. The character has also been used to show the effects of temporary paralysis, after he is injured in a car crash with his brother Brody. During the 2019 season finale, Mason is shot dead in a hospital siege. Casting On 5 December 2015, Jonathon Moran from The Daily Telegraph reported actors Orpheus Pledger, Jackson Heywood and James Stewart had joined the cast of Home and Away as brothers Mason, Brody and Justin Morgan respectively. The family drew immediate comparisons to the show's Braxton brothers, who were introduced to the show in 2011. All three actors began filming their first scenes during the following week, ahead of their on-screen debut in 2016. Pledger was living with his mother and brother in Melbourne when he was offered the role of Mason, which required him to move to Sydney, where the show's studios are located. Pledger said his 2011 role as Noah Parkin on fellow Australian soap opera Neighbours helped him prepare for the workload and the pace of filming. Pledger made his first appearance on 7 June 2016, alongside Heywood and Stewart. Development =Characterisation and introduction= Ahead of his screen debut, Pledger described Mason as having a \\"positive outlook on life\\", being family orientated, and \\"a hopeless romantic\\". He also said Mason \\"leads with his gut and stands up for what he believes in and will always stick up for the little guy.\\" Pledger later called his character \\"a free spirit\\" and a positive person to be around. The actor explained that following the death of their parents, Mason's siblings helped him to grow up and unlike them, Mason has not had to take on many responsibilities. Of the comparisons to the Braxton brothers, Heywood said the Morgans had a different dynamic, while Pledger added that family comes first for the Morgans. Mason is a medical student, who struggles to fit in a social life in between studying and working out in the gym. Pledger called Tori a good role model for Mason and as a result, they share a very close relationship. Pledger shares some similarities with Mason, particularly his dedication to attaining his dream job. The actor explained, \\"I've done that in my life with acting. Maybe it's not the same formality as studying to be a doctor and having to do a seven-year introduction to it before you even start but, definitely, if I was passionate about it, I would definitely do it.\\" The character's appearance changed in 2017 when Pledger shaved his \\"trademark\\" curly hair in favour of a shorter haircut. Pledger later said that he thought a shorter haircut was best for his character at that point, but that he was beginning to grow it longer for Mason again. Mason, Justin and Brody, along with their dog Buddy, are almost involved in a car crash with Martin \\"Ash\\" Ashford (George Mason) while they are driving to Summer Bay to join their sister, Tori. Ash swerves across the road in front of them while texting. After coming to a stop, Justin immediately gets out of the car to confront Ash, and Brody and Mason desperately try to keep them from getting into a physical fight. The Morgans continue their journey to the Bay, where they find Ash talking with Tori and Alf Stewart (Ray Meagher) on the beach and another fight almost breaks out, until Tori reveals that Justin, Brody and Mason are her brothers. Ash accepts that he was in the wrong, while Justin is glad his family have made it to the Bay safely. The siblings also wonder if they will be able to stay in their new home, leading to the start of their first major storyline. =Witness protection= An Inside Soap columnist observed that the Morgans had been hiding something about their past from the Bay's residents. They initially keep to themselves and Justin warns Tori against befriending local doctor Nate Cooper (Kyle Pryor). Stewart explained that there were a set of rules that the Morgans had to live by, which related to their secret. While studying at home one day, Mason is visited by his former girlfriend Lara Adams (Elle Harris). Lara tells Mason off for not staying in contact with her. Justin arrives home shortly after and finds Lara and Mason together. He orders Lara to leave, while warning Mason that he has compromised the family. Stewart confirmed that Justin's reaction had something to do with the family's secret. Lara comes to the hospital to see Mason, who asks her to leave in case she is seen. Later, while he is looking for Lara, Mason comes across an upset Evelyn MacGuire (Philippa Northeast) and he comforts her. Lara sees them together and assumes Mason is also dating Evie. In an effort to reconnect with Lara, Mason tells her that his family are in witness protection. Later that day, Brody mentions that he is being followed, so Mason admits that he told Lara about their secret. Justin decides that they need to pack up and leave. After Tori is threatened by Spike Lowe (Jason Montgomery), the family's police liaison officer Atticus Decker (John Adam) has them moved to a safe house. As they wait to find out where they will be moved to next, the family agree that they are tired of running from the people who killed their parents. When his siblings begin arguing, Mason slips outside to meet up with Lara. However, he soon learns that she is working for Spike and Blaine Varden (Ashley Lyons), the man who killed the Morgan's parents. Spike and Blaine trick Mason into telling them where the safe house is and they hold the family hostage. Blaine produces a gun and threatens to kill them all, before revealing that Justin knew the truth about the circumstances that led to their parents' deaths. Mason is one of nine characters involved in a plane crash, after Spike sabotages a plane being used for Tori's birthday trip. Justin attempts to warn the pilot, Duncan Stewart (Benedict Wall), but a broken pipe leaks carbon dioxide into the cabin and everyone passes out. However, Duncan does manage to crash land the plane in the sand first. While most of the passengers escape major injury, Mason is \\"panic-stricken\\" when he realises that Brody is missing. Later developments in the storyline saw the Morgans meet Decker's nieces Hope (Jessica Falkholt) and Raffy Morrison (Olivia Deeble). They soon realise that Raffy could be their half-sister, after Decker admits to having an affair with their mother. A DNA test confirms their suspicions, but before they tell Raffy, Hope steals Mason's car and attempts to leave town with her. The Morgans eventually tell Raffy she is their half-sister and that they had to go into witness protection because their parents were killed by drug dealers. The Morgan's secret is soon revealed to the rest of the Bay in the local newspaper. =Relationships= Evelyn MacGuire Mason shares a drunken kiss with Evie after a night out. The following week, they have dinner together and Mason confronts Evie about her drinking and partying. However, instead of talking to him about her issues, Evie just kisses Mason again and they have sex. They agree to a friends with benefits arrangement. Mason becomes concerned when Evie insists that she survived the plane crash because her deceased brother Oscar MacGuire (Jake Speer) is watching over her. Determined to prove her theory, Evie takes Mason out in her car and begins driving recklessly, as she is convinced that she will not crash. Mason is \\"petrified\\" by her stunt and when they stop, he \\"lets rip at her\\". Mason eventually develops feelings for Evie, but she reacts angrily to his admission and tells him she is not interested in a relationship with him. A reporter for The Daily Telegraph noted the arrangement would not last long, after Northeast was photographed filming a kissing scene with Alec Snow, who plays Matt Page. Olivia Fraser Richards Mason is involved in a love triangle when he dates Olivia Fraser Richards, played by Raechelle Banno (pictured). Producers later paired Mason with Olivia Fraser Richards (Raechelle Banno) and formed a love triangle storyline with her ex-boyfriend Hunter King (Scott Lee). Mason shows an interest in dating Olivia and she is \\"drawn to him\\". Pledger told Alison Gardner of What's on TV that Mason \\"really likes\\" Olivia and readily accepts her invitation to accompany her to the formal. The pair soon learn that Hunter is also attending, and Mason realises that Olivia still has feelings for him. Olivia leaves Mason at the bar and begins dancing with Hunter, but she explains that she was just passing the time while she waited for Mason to return. Pledger continued, \\"As the evening goes on, it's clear Olivia's still into Hunter. Mason's had so much to deal with because of his family's problems that he doesn't need Olivia to bring him even more heartache.\\" The following morning, Olivia visits Mason at the lifeguard station, where he is starting his new job, to tell him that what happened with Hunter meant nothing, but Mason replies that he does not need any more stress in his life. Later that day, Mason gets into a fight with Hunter. Pledger said that Mason \\"acts completely out of character\\" when he hits Hunter and is left feeling ashamed after Alf breaks up the fight. Olivia asks Mason if they can start their relationship over, but Mason rejects the idea. However, when they attend the Summer Grooves music festival, Mason and Olivia kiss. Olivia later admits to Mason that she is worried about Hunter's decision not to return to school and he attempts to talk to Hunter, as he is annoyed that she is worrying about him all the time. They pair have to separated by Alf again, and Lee commented that while Hunter does not have a friendship with Mason, he wants to get better at dealing with things. Mason and Olivia are soon caught having sex at the Summer Bay Auto garage by Brody and Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger). When Mason comes to The Diner to help Olivia out, he notices she is acting strangely. He soon learns from Alf that Hunter helped Olivia at The Diner the night before, leaving Olivia feeling guilty she did not tell Mason herself. Mason then confronts Hunter and asks him if he wants to get back together with Olivia, but Hunter says no. Mason and Olivia's relationship becomes strained as he worries that she still has feelings for Hunter, and when she admits that he is right, but wants to still date him, Mason breaks up with her. Beth Ellis A new love interest for Mason was introduced in the form of guest character Beth Ellis (Anneliese Apps) in August 2017. Beth tells Mason that she is a nurse and they soon bond while he is a patient in the hospital. Beth's friendship helps Mason's recovery from injuries he sustained in a car crash. While looking for Beth, Mason soon learns that she is actually a patient. Mason is \\"furious\\" that Beth has lied to him, but she soon reveals that she is dying. Beth explains that she needs a heart transplant, after being diagnosed with a serious heart condition five years prior. Mason urges Beth not to give up hope that she will get the transplant and they share \\"a heartfelt moment\\", which led a New Idea columnist to speculate that they could be more than just friends. Mason later asks Beth out on a date and she accepts. Of their romance, Pledger told Tamara Cullen of TV Week, \\"Beth brings out the best in Mason. He's playful and has no inhibitions with her.\\" When Mason finds Beth's bucket list, she tells him that she accepts that she is not getting any better and is starting to reconsider her treatment. When Mason tries to reassure her that she will be fine, Beth gets angry and Mason is forced to apologise. He then surprises her with a champagne lunch, where they bond further and kiss. Pledger commented, \\"Mason has never had a connection with anyone else like this.\\" Mason finds Beth's bucket list and sees that she has fun and \\"romantically charged\\" things on it, which Mason wants to help her complete. Mason comes up with the idea of a James Bond style trip to the casino. During the journey, Beth passes out while she driving. Mason is \\"petrified\\" and worried about the harm to Beth's health. He is also left feeling helpless as he cannot do anything about her condition. Mason asks to meets Beth's parents, but she is reluctant. However, Mason later meets Beth and her father Alan Ellis (Blair McDonough) at the beach, so he introduces himself. Alan is unaware that his daughter is dating anyone, but he invites Mason to lunch with Beth and her mother Jackie (Rachael Coopes), where Mason tries to make a good impression. Both Apps and Pledger hoped Beth and Mason's storyline would raise more awareness about organ donation in Australia. Pledger also thought the plot could increase the number of people willing to be organ donors. Both actors found the storyline tough to film, with Pledger calling it \\"a harrowing experience\\". The storyline concludes with Beth's death. Mason wants to make the most of the time they have left and organises a lunch on the beach. But Beth collapses and Mason rushes her to the hospital, where she tells him she loves him. Beth goes into cardiac arrest and dies. =Paralysis= Mason becomes a victim of his brother Brody's drug addiction when they are in a car crash together, which leaves him with temporary paralysis. The storyline begins when Mason finds Brody searching through the bin for drugs, as he is suffering a relapse. Mason knows that Brody needs help, so he manages to get Brody into his car to drive him to rehab. During the journey, Brody is convinced that his dealer William Zannis (Caleb Alloway) is following them. He suddenly grabs the wheel, causing the car to leave the road and crash. Brody suffers minor injuries, but Mason's condition deteriorates and he is placed in a coma after he loses the feeling in his hand. Tori is forced to tell Brody, Justin and Raffy that Mason may never walk again, as he has severe spinal damage. The diagnosis prompts Brody to sell his restaurant and leave town for a private rehab. Weeks later, Tori prepares to take Mason off the ventilator and wake him up, so she can assess how much damage there is to his spinal cord. But Mason fails to wake up and a neurosurgeon informs Tori that they will need to wait until the spinal shock has worn off. Days later, Mason finally wakes and is able to tell Tori that he cannot feel his legs. As he fears that he may never be able to walk again, Mason undergoes a series of tests and is told that once the swelling goes down, he may regain some feeling back. After Mason is discharged from the hospital, Brody attempts to apologise for causing the accident. Mason \\"erupts with fury\\" and attempts to strangle his brother. Justin and Tori try to get the brothers to reconcile, but they struggle to get through to \\"an increasingly-bitter\\" Mason. Justin later takes Mason to see their parents' graves to remind him that the family needs to stay together. Mason then accepts Brody's handshake, ending their feud. Pledger later posted a photo of himself walking around the outdoor set on his social media, confirming that Mason would recover from his paralysis. =Departure= During the serial's season finale, broadcast on 27 November 2019, the character was killed off after being shot by a member of the Ouroboros gang, who had taken several characters hostage in the hospital. In an interview with TV Week, Pledger confirmed that his departure was a joint decision between himself and the producers, saying \\"it was a creative decision because it benefits the show the most at this time. And it gave me a bit of time to prepare for a lot of things as well, so there was no stress. I mean it was just so good.\\" Speaking about his final scenes, Pledger called Mason \\"heroic\\" and compared his death to an intense song, explaining that there was a lot of momentum and \\"a bit of a crescendo moment\\" when he was killed. Storylines Mason, Brody and Justin Morgan join their sister Tori in Summer Bay. Mason and Brody have to stop Justin from fighting Martin \\"Ash\\" Ashford, who almost ran them off the road. Days after their arrival, Mason's former girlfriend Lara Adams visits him and they have sex. Justin catches them together and warns Lara to stay away. Mason confronts Justin, forcing Brody to stop them from fighting. Mason starts working at Brody's restaurant as a waiter, while he is also given a placement at the local hospital, where he clashes with his supervisor Nate Cooper. Lara sees Mason comforting Evie MacGuire and when she threatens to break up with him, Mason tells Lara that his family is in witness protection, as their parents were murdered by a drug syndicate. After their cover is exposed, the Morgans leave the Bay for a safe house. Mason slips outside to see Lara, but he is kidnapped by Spike Lowe and Blaine Varden, who Lara has been working for. Blaine threatens to kill the Morgans, before revealing that Justin knew that their father was working for the syndicate and that their mother sacrificed herself to save him. Lara frees Mason and the family are saved by the police and their federal protection officer, Decker. Mason and Tori ask Justin to leave the house, after learning that he lied to them. Mason helps Evie out with a charity sleepover at Summer Bay High. They kiss, but she pulls away and he apologises. When Evie gets drunk at a university party, Mason brings her home and lets her stay on his sofa. While they are studying together, Mason and Evie have sex. They both admit that they are not over their former partners and agree to a friends with benefits arrangement. During a plane trip for Tori's birthday, a carbon monoxide leak causes the passengers and captain to pass out. The plane crashes into the desert and Mason has to treat a pregnant Billie Ashford (Tessa de Josselin), whose amniotic sac is damaged. Mason burns his arm when he pushes Evie out of the way of a fuel explosion. Evie insists that she was saved by her deceased brother and tries to prove that he is protecting her by driving dangerously with Mason in the car. Mason is forced to apply the handbrake to stop them from crashing. Mason realises he has feelings for Evie and wants more than a casual relationship with her. He eventually ends their arrangement. The Morgans learn Decker's niece Raffy Morrison is actually his daughter and their half-sister. Mason is in favour of telling Raffy the truth and attempts to make her feel like part of the family. After noticing Olivia Fraser Richards arguing with her former boyfriend Hunter King, Mason asks her to go for a walk with him. He asks her out on a date, but she turns him down as she is not ready for a new relationship. Olivia invites Mason to escort her to her formal as friends, where she spends most of the night talking and dancing with Hunter. Mason begins working as a lifeguard and gets into a fight with Hunter on his first day. Mason helps Brody out at the Summer Grooves music festival, and he and Olivia kiss, before leaving to go skinny dipping. Mason and Olivia start dating, but he worries that she still has feelings for Hunter. The couple are later caught having sex at Summer Bay Auto. Olivia eventually admits to Mason that she does still have feelings for Hunter, but she wants to carry on dating him; however, Mason breaks up with her. Olivia later sets Mason up with her friend Lena Ascot (Felicity McKay), but nothing comes of it after he finds her dealing drugs at a party. Brody later develops a drug addiction and Mason has to take him to the hospital when he is beaten by his dealer. Mason is forced to work with Hunter at the surf club, where they clash again. Mason refuses to fight Hunter when he challenges him and they eventually become friends. Mason realises Brody is suffering a relapse and drives him to rehab. Brody panics when he sees his dealer following them and grabs the wheel, causing the car to crash. Mason suffers spinal damage and is placed on life support. When he wakes, he realises that he has little feeling in his legs. Beth Ellis visits Mason and cheers him up. She tells him she is a nurse, but Mason soon learns she is a patient, who has cardiomyopathy and needs a heart transplant. Mason helps Beth to complete some things on her bucket list and they kiss. While driving to a casino, Beth collapses and Mason is forced to drive to get help. He later meets Beth's parents and her father Alan asks him to stay away from her, but he changes his mind. Mason and Beth have sex, but Beth collapses at the pier later that night. Mason tries to get her moved up the transplant list and pressures a car crash victim's husband into donating her heart. A complaint is made against him and his placement at the hospital is cancelled. Mason takes Beth out for lunch on the beach where he gives her an eternity ring. However, Beth becomes breathless and Mason rushes her back to the hospital. She goes into cardiac arrest and dies. Mason later sees visions of Beth and attempts to complete the rest of her bucket list. After quitting his university course in the wake of Beth's death, Mason applies for the manager's job at the gym. Willow Harris (Sarah Roberts) also applies and John Palmer's (Shane Withington) gives it to them both. Mason gives Jennifer Dutton (Brittany Santariga) a private boxing lesson and she kisses him, but he pulls away and she makes it seem that he had made an unwelcome advance towards her as Hunter walks in. She apologises after Mason tells her about Beth. Mason befriends Jasmine Delaney (Sam Frost) and they bond over their respective medical careers. Mason decides to return to university and he is allowed to continue his placement at Northern Districts hospital. Mason develops feelings for Jasmine, and asks her to be his date to Ziggy Astoni's (Sophie Dillman) birthday party. When Mason comes to pick her up from Salt, he sees her talking to Colby Thorne (Tim Franklin), who Jasmine has feelings for. Mason befriends Dempsey Blackwood (Sophie Don) during a singles night at Salt, but their date is interrupted by Hunter and Olivia. Weeks later, Dempsey returns to Salt and Mason apologises to her for getting distracted. He invites her to be his guest at Brody and Ziggy's wedding, where he is acting as best man. After the wedding, Mason spends the night at Dempsey's place. Weeks later, Dempsey returns to the Bay to tell Mason that she is pregnant. Mason says that he will support her and the baby, but Dempsey feels pressured by his declaration. She later tells him that she wants to have a proper relationship with him and raise the baby together, to which he agrees. However, when Dempsey suffers a miscarriage scare, she realises that she does not want the baby and books an abortion. Mason later tries again for another placement at the hospital but is successful this time, Mason goes to work at the Hospital, but during his shift The Ouroboros Gang take all the patients and staff hostage, meanwhile Bella becomes really sick and the gang refuse treatment for her, Mason argues with them, but is shot dead in the process. Reception For his portrayal of Mason, Pledger was nominated for Best Newcomer at the Digital Spy Reader Awards; he placed last after receiving 3% of the total vote. Jonathon Moran of The Daily Telegraph predicted that Pledger \\"will no doubt be a hit with the young female fans with his buff body.\\" Sarah Ellis from Inside Soap branded Mason, Brody and Justin \\"another trio of troublesome brothers\\". She also noted their appearances, dubbing them \\"a tasty trio\\" and \\"hunky\\". Ali Cromarty and Stephen Downie of TV Week were impressed by the brothers, commenting, \\"Move over Braxtons, there's a new family of hot brothers in Summer Bay.\\" They also called them \\"loyal, caring and hard-working\\". Downie later called the siblings \\"the mysterious Morgan brothers\\" and pointed out that they landed in \\"a whole lot of trouble\\" upon their arrival. Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy dubbed the Morgans \\"Summer Bay's unluckiest family\\". Writing for Stuff.co.nz, Kerry Harvey dubbed Mason \\"Summer Bay's good boy\\" and observed that he was \\"chilled- out\\". She also named him \\"the most sensible member of the Morgan clan\\".

He taught in universities in Malawi, Zambia and the United States and his research in the first two countries inclined him toward the view that Central Africa underwent a period of underdevelopment that began in the mid-19th century and accelerated under colonial rule. After his return to the United States, he cooperated with Landeg White on studies of colonial Mozambique and on the value of African poetry and songs as a source of oral history. Early life, education and family Hazen Leroy Vail, known throughout his adult life as Leroy Vail was born in Boston, Massachusetts on August 5, 1940, to parents of Canadian origin. His father, Hazen Claude Vail, from Belleisle, New Brunswick, moved to Boston as an adult and his mother, born Mary Teresa MacLean in Cape Breton Island, arrived there as a young girl. He had one younger brother, born in 1943. Leroy grew up in the Allston neighbourhood of Boston, where he attended local public schools. In 1952, he was admitted to the Boston Latin School, graduating in 1958, and then entered Boston College to study Classics, but he changed to studying history after taking a sophomore course on medieval Europe, and graduated magna cum laude in history in 1962.Akyeampong, Appiah, Miller and Womack, Jr, (2000). Memorial Minute. Vail attended graduate school at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, intending to study British imperial history under Philip Curtin. However, he quickly moved to the comparative tropical history program led by Curtin and Jan Vansina, where he studied African history and historical linguistics.Miller, Jr, (1999). In Memoriam. He was awarded an M.A. in History in 1965, after which he was involved in Bantu language research at Madison, in its newly founded Department of African Languages and Literature. Leroy married Patricia Ann Horochena, who held a master's degree in mathematics from the University of Wisconsin ‚Äì Madison in 1967. In 1988 she and Vail took a Zambian girl, Sharon Mulenga, into their home as their daughter. Patricia Vail died on 26 February 2007.Boston Globe (2007) In 1996 Vail suffered a massive heart attack but recovered and returned to work. However, he was later diagnosed with lymphoma which, in the autumn of 1998, spread uncontrollably. He died at his home in Concord on 27 March 1999. Academic career =In Africa= Vail was awarded a one-year traveling fellowship by the University of Wisconsin in 1967 and decided to undertake research in Malawi. He became a Lecturer in History in the newly-founded University of Malawi and remained there until 1971. After leaving the country, he became a fierce critic of the regime of its first president, Hastings Banda. In 1967‚Äì68 Vail began linguistic research among the Tumbuka people of northern Malawi, publishing his first article, The Noun Classes of Tumbuka in 1971 followed by later ones reinterpreting Tumbuka history and examining the operations of Portuguese companies in the lower Zambezi Valley of Mozambique. He returned to in Madison in 1971 to complete his doctoral thesis Aspects of the Tumbuka Verb, which was accepted in 1972. He was unable to obtain an African History post in North America, so returned to Africa in 1973 as Senior Lecturer in History and African Languages in the University of Zambia, remaining there until 1978. During his time at this university, he organized an undergraduate course in African Languages and a Masters course in African History, and published several important articles on the history of Malawi, Zambia and Mozambique. =In the US= Vail returned to the United States in 1978, and was visiting Associate Professor successively at Virginia for the 1978‚Äì79 academic year, UCLA, for 1979‚Äì80 and Ohio for 1980‚Äì81. He then gained a Research Fellowship on the Yale Southern African Research Program in 1981-82, returning to Virginia for the 1982‚Äì83 academic year. Meanwhile, his first book, Capitalism and Colonialism in Mozambique which he co-authored with Landeg White, was published. Its history was based on archival material and also on African women's songs that recorded the African suffering caused by Portuguese rule in the Lower Zambezi. In 1983, he organized a symposium for historians and anthropologists of southern Africa that investigated the historical nature of African ethnicities in a landmark collection, The Creation of Tribalism in Southern Africa. Vail became visiting Associate Professor of History at Harvard the spring term 1984, and received his first regular American academic appointment there later that year as Associate Professor of History, being given tenure in 1990, and becoming Chairman of the Committee on African Studies from then until 1995. His second book with Landeg White, Power and the Praise Poem, was published in 1992. This argued that oral history was real history and that poets and their poetry for played a significant role in transmitting Southern African history. In 1994, after the Banda regime had ended, Vail returned to Malawi as a United Nations monitor for the elections of 1994. Research interests =Underdevelopment hypothesis= In the 1970s, soon after many former African colonies had become independent, two different approaches were taken to the historical treatment of the period of colonial rule, in Malawi and elsewhere in Africa. One, the Nation-building concept saw the colonial period as an episode in building the post-colonial nation. This view weighed the benefits of the physical infrastructure and economic structures inherited by the new nation against colonial restrictions on African political and social advancement.Pachai (1973) Vail questioned the basis of the evolutionary Nation-building scheme of interpretationVail (1989), p. xi, 3-4 and was a strong advocate of the concept of Underdevelopment in Central Africa. His attachment to this concept began with his research among what he called the dispossessed and atrociously exploited Tumbuka people. Vail saw underdevelopment as a step-by-step process of impoverishment and stagnation that started in the middle of the 19th century but accelerated under colonial rule. His theme, developed in four significant papers published between 1975 and 1981, was that the in Indian Ocean ivory and slave trades created a demand for imported goods among the people to the west of Lake Malawi in the late 18th and early 19th century and prompted social differentiation within their traditional societies.Vail (1981), pp. 233-4, 238 The mid-19th century incursion of Ngoni peoples into what is now the Northern Region of Malawi and Eastern Province of Zambia caused a further loss of status of among many indigenous groups, whose people become Ngoni serfs or refugees with limited access to land.Vail (1981), p. 244 =In Ngoni occupied areas= The conversion of migratory Ngoni pastoralism into a mixed agricultural economy placed, in Vail's view, increasing pressure on subject peoples to produce more cereals, which provoked a series of revolts among these subjects in the 1870s. Vail believed that Ngoni practices of shifting or slash-and-burn cultivation and extensive cattle herding and their preference for living in large villages rather than in dispersed farmsteads, as the original inhabitants had done, caused overgrazing and the loss of soil fertility near the villages and the development of uncultivated bush in the areas between villages, into which wild animals carrying Tsetse fly moved and infected nearby cattle.Vail (1977), pp. 131-2 In what became northern Nyasaland, revolts by the oppressed Tumbuka, ecological degradation and the famine it caused undermined the position of the local Ngoni king, Mbelwa.Vail (1981), p. 250 These events predated any significant European presence in the area, but from the 1870s the African Lakes Company began to import European goods into the area and to transport young African men to work in European enterprises the south. Scottish Presbyterian missionaries also arrived in the area and Mbelwa, who had little power over influential Ngoni military leaders, sought an alliance with the missionaries to strengthen his position against those opponents that saw trying to accommodate the increasing European presence around the shores of Lake Malawi as a betrayal of traditional values.Vail (1981), pp. 248, 250 At first, Mbelwa saw Christianity and missionary education as more suitable for Tumbuka serfs than polygamous Ngoni warriors, and their first missions were in Tumbuka or Tonga areas, although he later saw the missionaries‚Äô value for the northern Ngoni state.Vail (1981), pp. 251-3 Although Mbelwa's Ngoni retained their autonomy until 1904, Vail considers that their social and economic position and those of the Tumbuka were weakened as previous relatively egalitarian class systems became more unequal when they were drawn into the capitalist economy.Vail (1981), pp. 247-8 The Ngoni in North-Eastern Rhodesia lost most of their cattle, representing their wealth, in the rinderpest epidemic of the early 1890s and many of their remaining cattle were seized by British South African Company forces which conquered the Ngoni in that area later in the decade.Vail (1977), pp. 133-4 Restrictions on Africans possessing guns for hunting elephants and other wild animals deprived them, in Vail's view, of sources of income and meat, and the imposition of a hut tax and land expropriation in Northern Rhodesia in the first decade of the 20th century further impoverished this area.Vail (1977), pp. 135-7 According to Vail, the Ngoni invasions and the advent of colonial rule had created the so-called Dead North in Nyasaland and impoverishment around Chipata in North-Eastern Rhodesia. The colonial policies in these areas and in Mozambique resulted in leaving local African men at best little choice but become labor migrantsVail (1977), p. 137 and at worst in their forced recruitment for the mines, farms and other employers of Southern Rhodesia and South Africa.Vail (1981), p. 247Vail and others (1979), pp. 247-8 He considered that the absence of many able-bodied men restricted the ability of those women, youths and older men remaining to produce food or cash crops, and European farmers discouraged the growth of cash crops that might compete with them.Vail (1977), pp. 137-8, 143-4Vail and others (1979), pp. 250-2 As a result of these policies, Vail believed that, for the forty years until 1939, the people the British colonies were impoverished and exploited and that post- World War Two policies came too late to make good the damage causedVail (1977), p. 155 =Nyasaland's railways= Although Pachai strongly believed that the development of Nyasaland's railways was a positive contribution by the British government to the protectorate's development,Pachai (1973), p. 150 Vail considered that the policies of the British government and the local colonial administration turned Nyasaland into an Imperial Slum and a labor reserve for Southern Rhodesia and South Africa. He argued the country's economy was burdened by heavy debts arising from colonial railway construction, which he considered was designed to benefit British companies and interests at the expense of Nyasaland and which hindered its economic development.Vail (1975), pp. 89-90 Initially, the landlocked protectorate was reached from the Indian Ocean along the Zambezi and Shire rivers, which were free of customs dues to international traffic, but falling Shire river levels in the early 20th century created difficulties in maintaining a continuous service.Vail (1975), p. 93 The first railway project was to link the most developed part of the country, the Shire Highlands, to a suitable river port, although this line had to be extended southward as water levels in the Shire continued to fall, and it eventually reached the Zambezi.Vail (1975), pp. 89-90, 93, 98 A railway from Beira in Mozambique to Salisbury in Southern Rhodesia had been opened in 1899 and, after a possible alternative rail route from Quelimane toward the Nyasaland border stalled after the First World War, the British government was under pressure from British-owned companies to link Nyasaland's railways to this line.Vail (1975), pp. 99-101 Although, as Vail stated, the primary benefit of the Beira route did not accrue to Nyasaland, the protectorate was expected to pay interest and repay capital on loans for the construction of the railway link and the Dona Ana Bridge over the Zambezi out of the expected increase in government revenues. By 1935, the country was liable to repay debts of ¬£5.1 million.Vail (1975), pp. 102-3, 109-10 Vail also notes that the colonial administration abandoned development plans in the 1930s, attributing this to its indebtedness rather than the Great Depression in general. He suggested that this debt burden left its government with insufficient funds to promote the growing of exportable crops by African farmers. The high freight charges levied by the railways to Beira were a further disincentive to agricultural development and forced protectorate to rely on exporting migrant labor, so producing widespread slum-like conditions and making it little more than a labor reserve.Vail (1975), pp. 110-12 =Creation of tribalism= In the 1980s, Vail considered the historical background to the creation of ethnicity and the resurgence of tribalism in Central and Southern Africa. His experience in Malawi suggested to him that, in the late 1960s shortly after the independence of several former colonies, there was a revival of the ethnic and regional consciousness that had been established earlier in the 20th century, but which became less prominent during struggles for independence.Vail (1989), pp. x-xi This revival reflected the artificial origin of most post-colonial African states and their rapid adoption of one-party rule: the development of regionalism and tribalism was a reaction to the dominant party trying to impose a false unity on the existence of ethnic diversity.Vail (1989), p. 2 Vail did not accept, as other authors had claimed, that ethnicity resulted from the colonial powers‚Äô divide-and-rule tactics, from the rigid classification of African peoples into fixed tribes by European anthropologists or when previously isolated rural groups came together and into conflict in urban or industrial settings.Vail (1989), pp. 2-5 He also questioned whether the growth of ethnic particularism was related to uneven development in colonial times that gave some groups better access to education and employment, or to the creation of myths regarding ancestral political structures that were disrupted in the colonial era.Vail (1989), pp. 5-6 Although accepting that all these explanations might have some validity, Vail considered them unhistorical and pointed to the impoverishment of Central and Southern Africa in the late 19th and early 20th century through ecological catastrophes such as the rinderpest epidemic, disease, locusts and famine, colonial land expropriation and taxes and labor migrancy, all of which amounted to African people losing control of their lives.Vail (1989), pp. 7-9 He believed that the decline of traditional power systems and the growth of both European organized and African initiated churches gave rise to new identities that, for European missionaries or anthropologists or educated Africans themselves, were ethnic identities, each with its language, often fixed by missionaries for used in education, and a rediscovered or manufactured history and traditions.Vail (1989), pp. 10-13 In the decade following independence in 1964, political views in Malawi were frequently expressed in ethnic terms, and groups that had prospered under the colonial regime were stigmatized as being unfaithful to the country's Chewa culture which the ruling party and president promoted.Vail and White (1989), pp. 151-2 Before the ratification of a British protectorate over what became Nyasaland, there were many ethnic groups in the area. Missionaries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries homogenized the various local dialects into a relatively small number of standardized languages, so that the Tumbuka language became the medium of teaching in the north of the country, the Chewa language in the centre and Nyanja and Yao languages in the south.Vail and White (1989), pp. 156-7 The Chewa and Nyanja languages are closely related and the official standard was called Chinyanja until 1968, when the president of Malawi Hastings Banda, who came from the predominantly Chewa Central Province insisted on it being called Chichewa.Vail and White (1989), p. 178 The education provided by Scottish-run missions at several sites in the Northern Province of Nyasaland was superior to that found in most other parts of the protectorate, although other Scottish missionaries at Blantyre Mission also provided educational advancement for some southerners.Vail and White (1989), p. 166 Those that these missions trained became an educated African elite, who found employment as teachers, in the civil service or in commerce, and whose political aim was African advancement to higher positions in the administration and to obtain a political voice. In contrast, the Yao in the south, including many Muslims debarred from Christian education, and the Chewa in the centre, where fewer missions were founded, were more resentful of the intervention of the colonial state and protective of their traditional culture than motivated by political aspirations.Vail and White (1989), pp. 173-4 Many of the leading figures in the Nyasaland African Congress in the late 1950s and early 1960s were Tumbuka speaking northerners or graduates of Blantyre Mission and, in 1963, in preparation for independence, these took a majority of the ministerial posts in Banda's government. Shortly after independence, in the 1964 Cabinet Crisis, the rejection of their demand for more rapid Africanisation, a key aim of the mission-educated elite, led to their resignation or sacking and, in most cases, their exile.Vail and White (1989), pp. 178-80 In the aftermath of this, Banda purged their supporters from positions of influence and replaced them with Chewa nominees from the Central Region, at the same time promoting the Chewa culture as the only authentic Malawian culture.Vail and White (1989), pp. 181-2 In addition to renaming the Chinyanja language Chichewa in 1968, Tumbuka was abolished as an official language and the medium of instruction in the Northern Region in the same year, and examination results and the secondary school entrance system were manipulated to assist candidates from the Central Region and disadvantage those from the Northern Region.Vail and White (1989), pp. 182-4 =Later interests= Towards the end of his career, Vail widened his interests, including a return to studying Bantu linguistics and at the time of his death, he had four books in progress, three on Central Africa Spirits, Women, and Deprivation, in Malawi and Zambia since 1850, a dictionary of Lakeside Tonga, and Ideophones as stylistic devices in Tumbuka, the fourth was on ethnogenesisin modern Togo. It is possible that his dictionary of Lakeside Tonga may be published in the future.Mphande (2014), p. 53 Alternative views Vail's research was regarded as innovative when published, but his views in three areas have been reassessed by other scholars or modified by later research: the extent of ecological damage caused by African agricultural practices, the degree of compulsion involved in labor migration and its overall effects, and the cost to Nyasaland of its colonial era railways. Two more recent assessments are that British rule was a mixed blessing for many of the peoples of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, as it brought an end to warfare and slave raiding, yet redirected much of their productive labor toward the capitalism of the south,Bond (2000), p. 181 and that many labor migrants travelled south clandestinely, ignoring governmental restrictions, in search of financial security; although many were exploited, others achieved modest prosperity after their return from their savings out of higher wages earned abroad.Mitchell (2013), pp. 17-18, 23 =Environmental degradation= Much of Vail's account of environmental degradation in Northern Nyasaland is based on the views of 19th century missionaries who regarded Ngoni farming practices as environmentally destructive, wasteful and therefore morally wrong, and also the attitudes of colonial officials from the 1930s onward who accepted the missionaries' views without any supporting empirical evidence.McCracken (2002), p. 173McCracken (2003), pp. 155-6, 162 Read regarded the Ngoni as having an efficient agricultural system based on the labor of their serfs, and accounts from the 1870s to 1890s mention extensive cultivation and cattle herding, and the apparent health and prosperity of the Ngoni people.Read (1956), p. 58 The main objection of missionaries and colonial officials was to the Ngoni shifting or slash-and-burn cultivation, which a few tropical agriculturalists from the 1950s began to recognize them as sympathetic to the environment,Beinart (1984), pp. 61-2 and which many modern-day tropical agriculturalists consider may be more efficient than fixed cultivation of many tropical soils.Thompson (2003), pp. 22-3 Vail expressly rejected Read's views, claiming she had been misadvised by Ngoni informants, but he did not consider the efficiency or otherwise of slash-and-burn cultivation.Vail (1981), pp. 231-2 Recent research supports Read's views, showing that, in 1998, most soils in Malawi were adequate for growing maize, as fertility had declined much less rapidly than forecast between the 1930s and 1950s.Snapp (1998), pp. 2572-88. =Labor migration= Vail's suggestions that the forced recruitment of labor and the forced consumption of foreign goods were imposed on the Tumbuka and Ngoni in northern Nyasaland in the later 19th century,Vail (1981), p. 247 or that other African men in Nyasaland, eastern Northern Rhodesia or Mozambique had little or no option but to become labor migrantsVail (1975), p. 111Vail (1977), pp. 137, 150-1Vail, White and Penvenne (1979), pp. 247-8 seem overstated. The first labor migrancy from the area between the north-western shores of Lake Nyasa and the Luangwa valley predated these areas becoming British dependencies, and was initially directed to the Shire Highlands. However, in the mid to late 1890s, some workers travelled voluntarily to Southern Rhodesia and South Africa where wages were much higher.McCraken (2012), p. 84 Rather than consistently promoting labor migration, the Nyasaland government opposed all migration of workers outside the protectorate before 1903 and from 1913 to 1936 and, when it did allow migrancy, the government insisted on enforcing controls on the numbers recruited by licensed labor organizations and a system of deferring part of the men's pay until they returned to Nyasaland. However, many workers left independently, disregarding government restrictions and licensed recruitersMcCraken (2012), pp. 85-7 For much of the first half of the 20th century, there was a debate on whether Nyasaland should have as its main economic function agriculture on European owned estates, peasant cash-crop production or the supply of migrant labor. Although labor migration was predominant in the Northern Province of Nyasaland and Eastern Province of Northern Rhodesia, regarding them simply as labor reserves ignores the increasing importance of peasant cash crop production in these areasMcCracken (2003), p. 156Moore and Vaughan, (2003), pp. 79-82, 89, 94 and government attempts to find suitable cash crops which could replace migrant laboring as the main source of local cash incomes.McCracken (2003), pp. 161-2 Peasant cash-crop production in Nyasaland's Central Province and this together with agriculture on European-owned estates in the Southern Province were far more important than labor migration to their local economies and that of Nyasaland as a whole in the colonial period.McCracken (2012), pp. 207, 257 Vail and White considered that the colonial administration of Mozambique pressured local Africans into migrant labor by discouraging them from growing cash crops and requiring them to engage in productive labor. However, Penvenne argued that Vail and White did not clearly distinguish between coercive labor conscription for work within Mozambique and migrant labor recruitment, where workers actively sought higher wages outside its territory. This external migrant labor was voluntary and often the subject of disapproval by officials or companies based in Mozambique.Vail, White and Penvenne (1979), pp. 277-8 =Railway finance= Vail's argument that the cost of railway links impoverished Nyasaland, preventing the government from promoting efficient peasant agriculture has also been questioned. The Nyasaland government only had to pay interest and repay capital on the loans for constructing the Trans- Zambezia Railway or Zambezi Bridge if its revenues exceeded target figures. During the period 1930 to 1947, it only paid interest in 1936 and repaid no capital, and all the accrued debt liabilities passed to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland in 1953.Irvine (1959), pp. 181-2. Rather than draining Nyasaland's admittedly meagre public funds, as Vail suggests, the railway and Zambezi Bridge cost it relatively little and provided a more effective, if underutilized, link to the outside world than the previously used option of river transport.McCracken (2012), p. 175. Although Vail mentions that various development projects were shelved in 1935, he does not provide a direct link between this and the increased public debt.Vail, (1975), p. 111. A more detailed review of the Nyasaland government's actual revenue and expenditure in the 1929 to 1939 Great Depression showed that revenue was maintained in the first part of that decade and rose in the second half,Baker (1974), pp. 9-10 and that ordinary government expenditure rose by 50% in the period, with significant increases in Social Services and Natural Resources spending and staff, although the amounts were small.Baker (1974), pp. 11-12, 15 References Sources *E Akyeampong, K A Appiah, J C Miller and J Womack, Jr. (2000).

He was most notable for his work to encourage mothers to be with their children when in hospitals. Life MacCarthy was the son of Sir Desmond MacCarthy, the foremost literary and dramatic critic of his day, and of Mollie Warre Cornish, the daughter of a vice-provost of Eton College. An author in her own right, Cornish wrote A Nineteenth-century childhood in 1924. MacCarthy was educated at Gresham's School and upon finishing his education there began to train as a physician at St Bartholomew's Hospital, London, where he qualified in 1934. MacCarthy took up a number of positions in medicine, before becoming a ship's doctor on a vessel travelling to the Far East. In 1947, he married Marie-France Geoffroy- Dechaume, whom he had known since childhood, but it was only when MacCarthy was in his mid thirties that romance blossomed. During World War II, Geoffroy- Dechaume joined the French Resistance and was awarded the Croix-de-Guerre for heroism in her active service against the enemy. Career Before the Second World War, MacCarthy had already decided to specialise and to become a paediatrician, and by the start of the war was working in Great Ormond Street Hospital. He became a Resident at about the time of the start of the Blitz, and some of his earliest duties included organizing the evacuation of children from the hospital to outlying and countryside hospitals. In 1942, he joined the Royal Naval Reserve and served as a surgeon, with the rank of Lieutenant, continuing to hold a commission until 1946. At the beginning of the National Health Service in 1948, the idea of Pediatrics, as a profession was still very new. Indeed, the word itself was barely known, and hardly in use, outside the medical community in the United Kingdom. During that period, at the end of 1940s, paediatricians were establishing children's units across the country. MacCarthy was selected to establish a series of children's wards, working initially in Aylesbury and then putting in units across the whole of Buckinghamshire, a task he continued to work on until 1976. MacCarthy's main contribution to paediatrics was made in the 1950s, when a movement arose to enable parents to visit their children in hospital, when they were convalescing. This movement was launched by a paper written by the paediatrician James Spence called The Case of Children in Hospital in which he argued that the parent should nurse and feel responsible for the child patient's recovery. Before this movement, visiting by parents was usually restricted and sometimes forbidden in certain hospitals. MacCarthy helped facilitate the movement by making an influential film with James Robertson, the second in the series, called Going to hospital with mother The film was filmed in the children's ward of Amersham Hospital. MacCarthy later worked as an advisor to the newly established National Association for the Welfare of Children in Hospital. The paper written by Spence, and work done by MacCarthy and others, led to the creation of the Platt Report, which ultimately recognized that: :Parents should be allowed to visit whenever they can, and to help as much as possible with the care of the child In 1974, MacCarthy became president of the paediatric section of the Royal Society of Medicine, while also a consultant paediatrician to the Institute of Child Psychology in London. During 1975, he was elected president of the Confederation of European Societies of Paediatricians. Bibliography *Sailing with Mr. Belloc by Dermod MacCarthy, Collins Harvill, 1987.

In close collaboration with the professional and trade associations, CRB acts on behalf of the Swiss construction industry in developing standard tools for use across the entire life cycle of buildings ‚Äì from design and construction to facility management. Adopting a uniform system structure and terminology, these tools facilitate the collaboration between clients, designers, contractors and suppliers, and provide the foundation for digitization in construction.  History and organization  Organized in the legal form of an \\"association\\" (under the Swiss Civil Code), CRB has some 5,000 members throughout Switzerland. It was formed in 1959 by the Federation of Swiss Architects (FSA). Other supporting bodies now include the Swiss Society of Engineers and Architects (SIA) and the Swiss Contractors' Association (SBV). Today, all the Swiss construction industry's key associations and organizations are represented on the Board and support CRB's operations. CRB now has around 70 employees, who work at its offices in Zurich, Fribourg and Bellinzona. Moreover, each year, up to 400 construction professionals and practitioners are mandated to carry out work for CRB.  National and international networking  CRB collaborates closely with numerous construction-sector associations and organizations within Switzerland. To ensure that users can reap the full benefits of standardization and rationalization, now and in the future, subjects such as building information modelling (BIM) and digitization figure prominently in CRB's development work. CRB is a member of the following organizations: ‚Ä¢ netzwerk_digital: CRB's remit within this association, which supports and promotes the co-ordinated development of digitization in Switzerland, is standardization. Other members include SIA, the Co-ordination Conference for Federal Construction and Real Estate Authorities (KBOB) representing public- sector clients, the Private Professional Owners Interest Group (IPB) and \\"Bauen digital Schweiz\\" (Swiss Digital Construction). ‚Ä¢ buildingSMART International ‚Ä¢ International Construction Information Society (ICIS)  Core business  CRB's best-known tools are the Catalogue of Standard Descriptions (NPK) construction specification system, the Building Cost Classification (BCC) and two further, element-based cost classifications (eBKP-H and eBKP-T), all of which are available in German, French and Italian. CRB also has the exclusive rights in Switzerland for distribution of the Swedish-developed Natural Colour System (NCS). NCS is the only colour system to describe colours in the same way as they are perceived by the human eye. The Catalogue of Standard Descriptions specification system now comprises over one million brand- and product-neutral work items from the fields of building construction, civil engineering (incl. tunnelling) and building services. It allows the systematic preparation of consistent, detailed and clearly worded specifications for construction works. It is cross-linked to the cost planning and monitoring tools, and forms the basis for digital data exchange. The prd.crb.ch construction product platform provides construction professionals and practitioners with valuable product and manufacturer information. The production- or trade-oriented Building Cost Classification (BCC) is used by designers, contractors, clients and investors as a common basis for the uniform presentation of cost information. CRB has also produced two element- based cost classifications, the eBKP-H (for building construction) and eBKP-T (for civil engineering). These boost efficiency in cost planning by helping to identify those building elements with the highest costs and greatest optimization potential.

Towneley Colliery or Towneley Desmesne was a coal mine on the Burnley Coalfield in Burnley, Lancashire, England. Sunk in the late 1860s, it was linked to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Burnley to Todmorden line which became known as the Copy Pit route and, by tramway, to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal. Towneley Colliery was sunk next to Brooks and Pickup's fireclay works less than a half mile from Towneley railway station which served Towneley Hall. Brooks and Pickup began coal production from the main shaft, the Alice Pit in late February 1869. For 75 years coal was extracted from the Arley, Dandy, King and Yard mines. The colliery had sidings on either side of the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Burnley to Todmorden line, the Copy Pit route. A half-mile long tramway linking it to the Leeds and Liverpool Canal had four tunnels. Boggart Brig Pit beside the A671 Todmorden Road was linked by a tramroad and was also linked underground. The pit was also linked underground to Bank Hall Colliery a half mile distant. In 1923 the colliery was owned by Brooks & Brooks Collieries and employed 770 men working the colliery which included the Towneley Drift. In 1933 the Towneley Coal & Fireclay Company employed 672 men, 480 of them underground. The colliery produced fireclay as well as coal used for household and manufacturing use, coking and for producing gas. The colliery was nationalised in 1947 after which the National Coal Board worked the Yard, Dandy and Lower Mountain mines. Its satellite pits, Dyneley Knoll (), Boggart Brig () and Park Pits () closed in 1947 and were abandoned in 1949. The colliery closed on 6 March 1949. Its shafts were used for pumping until 1971 when Bank Hall Colliery closed. Little remains of the colliery, a residential development occupies a small part of the site and the rest comprises steep, mossy hillocks and woodland.

After Ehab Galal, who managed Telephonat Beni Suef in the 2013‚Äì14 season, was appointed as manager of Misr Lel Makkasa; Samy ended up joining Misr Lel Makkasa too after he was convinced by Galal to join him with his new club. =Misr Lel Makkasa= On 3 August 2014, Misr Lel Makkasa completed the signing of Samy in a 3-year contract alongside some of his teammates at Telephonat Beni Suef, including future club star Ahmed El Sheikh. Samy made his official debut in the first match of the 2014‚Äì15 Egyptian Premier League season in a 2‚Äì1 win against El Raja, playing the full 90 minutes in that match. Samy became an important player in the team quickly, and played 35 official matches in his first season with the club, including 32 in the league. After a great first season, the club finished fourth in the league and qualified for the 2016 CAF Confederation Cup, their first ever appearance in an African competition. Samy maintained his first- eleven place for the 2015‚Äì16 Egyptian Premier League after gaining his manager's trust after his performance in the previous season. In the 2015‚Äì16 season he played 29 league matches and scored 2 goals, against Ittihad El Shorta in a 1‚Äì1 draw in the first match of the season and against league champions Al Ahly in a 0‚Äì1 away win. Despite his performance, the club didn't do well in local competitions as they finished 10th in the league and got eliminated from the 2015‚Äì16 Egypt Cup in the Round of 32 by Egyptian Second Division side FC Masr. The club reached the Play-off round in the 2016 CAF Confederation Cup after beating Defence Force of Ethiopia, CS Don Bosco of DR Congo and CS Constantine of Algeria in the Preliminary round, First round and Second round respectively; but failed to make it to the group stage as they were eliminated by Al Ahli Tripoli of Libya after the Libyan club won on away goals. Samy played only 24 league matches in the 2016‚Äì17 Egyptian Premier League season due to suspension and a foot injury; but he maintained his good performance in both centre-back and defensive midfielder positions and helped his club to finish the league in the 2nd place and to qualify for the 2018 CAF Champions League for the first time in the club history. Al Ahly made a bid for Samy at the end of the season, but the club refused the offer and renewed his contract. On 3 March 2017, during Misr Lel Makkasa and Zamalek league match, Samy made controversies after he cleared a cross from a free-kick with his hand. All Zamalek players ran to the referee asking for a penalty, but the international referee Gehad Grisha didn't give it because he didn't see it and gave a corner instead. The match ended as a 1‚Äì0 win for Misr Lel Makkasa. Samy was announced as the club's new captain for the 2017‚Äì18 Egyptian Premier League season, after spending more that 3 years with the club. Many important players left Misr Lel Makkasa after the club announced the departure of coach Ehab Galal, as left the club by mutual consent; players including top goalscorer Ahmed El Sheikh, playmakers Hussein El Shahat and Emad Fathy and goalkeeper Ahmed Masoud; which led to instability in the team. On 30 December 2017, Samy alongside other players from the Egyptian Premier League and other Arab leagues played for Al Ahly against Atl√©tico Madrid in a friendly match under the slogan \\"Peace Against Terrorism\\" at Borg El Arab Stadium in Alexandria. The match ended 3‚Äì2 for Atl√©tico Madrid. International career Although Samy never represented the senior team, he was called to play two non-official matches with the national team against Yemen on 13 May 2017 and against Libya on 5 June 2017.

He was the fourth of seven children.The Canadian Worker Poet: the Life and Writings of Joe Wallace, James Doyle. University of Western Ontario When his mother died in 1897, due to complications related to child birth, his father move his family to Nova Scotia, living in Truro, North Sydney, and Halifax. At the age of eleven, Wallace ran away from home. His father, in response, sent his son to St. Patrick's Catholic Home for Boys. In 1910, he attended St. Francis Xavier University, from which he was expelled two years later. His brother got him a job at the International Correspondence School, becoming the Halifax district manager by 1911. He worked there until 1916. In 1915, he married Therese Dorothy (Dot) Granville, siring four children. In 1920, he resigned from the Liberals to join the socialist Halifax Labour Party, which was subsequently affiliated with the Canadian Labour Party. In 1922, he joined the Communist Party of Canada (CPC), for whom he wrote articles, essays, and poems for three major Canadian Communist newspapers: the Worker (1922‚Äì1936), the Daily Clarion (1936‚Äì1939), and the Canadian Tribune (1940‚Äì1975). He later became a full-time CPC journalist and activist after leaving his career in advertising in 1933. In 1925, his five-year-old daughter died; in 1927, his wife died. In 1928, he married Grace Beardsley, but soon separated. In 1933, he ran in the 17th Nova Scotia general election for a seat in Halifax. He was backed by the United Front Party, led by J. B. McLachlan. In 1940, when Mackenzie King invoked the War Measures act, making Communist activities effectively illegal, Wallace was imprisoned between 8 March 1941 ‚Äì October 1942. After his time in prison, he released his first volume of poetry Night Is Ended (1942). He then worked as a lathe operator at Ferranti Electric in Toronto, where he helped organize a union. In his spare time, he also began writing a column for the Tribune. In 1952, he help found the literary magazine New Frontier, and served as one of its first members of the editorial committee. The magazine survived for five years. In 1957, he traveled to Russia for ten-months, where he found his poetry known and appreciated. He returned to Russia in 1960, staying until 1963. In 1966, Wallace was invited as a guest of the Soviet government on a summer cruise to Denmark and Russia upon the luxury liner Pushkin. In 1968, he moved to Vancouver. On 1 December 1975, he died of a heart attack in Vancouver. For the entirety of his life, he was a devout Catholic. Legacy From the 1950s until after his death, Wallace was the most famous Canadian poet in Eastern Europe and China. In 1981, Progress Books prepared a selected edition of his works, titled Joe Wallace Poems.

Biography She was born at La Rochelle. Her father, a career officer, having been killed during the Gallipoli Campaign in 1915, she grew up at B√©ziers and received a scholarship to enable her to study history at Montpellier. After graduating in 1930, she became a teacher, holding positions at Gu√©ret and Toulouse and, in 1936, at the Lyc√©e Jules-Ferry in Paris, where she continued until 1950. In 1937, she met her husband Pol, and they were married in 1941. They had five children: Anne, Manuelle, Pierre, Luc and Roland. Gaillard became a militant Communist. In 1940, she offered refuge to the Jewish physicist Jacques Solomon, a fellow teacher and editor of an underground magazine, L'Universit√© libre, at her Paris home. Solomon was later arrested and executed by the occupying forces. Jeanne and her husband continued to participate in the production and distribution of the magazine. After the war, she was a regular contributor to the multidisciplinary publication La Pens√©e. In 1950, she took up a teaching post at the , but she was forced to leave in 1955, her health weakened by an earlier bout of tuberculosis. From 1964 to 1976, she worked as a \\"Ma√Ætre-assistante\\" at the Paris Nanterre University, where she published many articles and obtained her doctorate in history; her thesis, Paris, la ville, accepted in 1975, is extensively quoted in historical research. Adrian Rifkin calls it \\"a long and complex chef d'oeuvre of urban demography\\", but criticises Gaillard's use of history to support the Marxist economic theories of Guy Debord. Parallels have been drawn between Gaillard's work and Walter Benjamin's Arcades Project. Jeanne died in 1983 from an allergic reaction to a wasp bite.

Gateway Boulevard carries northbound traffic while Calgary Trail carries southbound traffic. From south of 31 Avenue, they form a two-way freeway separated by a median; for this portion, the roadway maintains the separate names for northbound and southbound traffic. Near 31 Avenue, Calgary Trail and Gateway Boulevard separate and become parallel one-way arterial roadways to Saskatchewan Drive, at the edge of the North Saskatchewan River valley. Designated as part of Highway 2 south of Whitemud Drive, it is Edmonton's main southern entrance and is both a major commuter route, connecting to the Edmonton International Airport and Leduc, as well as a regional connection to Central Alberta, and Calgary.  Route description  Calgary Trail and Gateway Boulevard enter Edmonton from the south along Highway 2, the city's busiest entrance, is core route of Canada's National Highway System, and part of the North-South Trade Corridor. Despite the freeway being a two-way roadway, the northbound lanes go by the name Gateway Boulevard and the southbound lanes go by the name Calgary Trail. At the city limits, the northern terminus of the Queen Elizabeth II Highway, is the interchange with 41 Avenue SW, which opened in 2015, and is the only numbered exit on Highway 2 within Edmonton. The freeway continues north past Gateway Park, a rest area which is marked by the historic Leduc No. 1 oil derrick; originally opened in 1987, it featured tourist information centre that closed in 2014. Calgary Trail and Gateway Boulevard reach Anthony Henday Drive (Highway 216), Edmonton's ring road, which is the northern extent of both National Highway System and trade corridor designations. It continues past South Edmonton Common and the interchange with 23 Avenue. North of 23 Avenue (around 31 Avenue), the freeway portion of the Calgary Trail and Gateway Boulevard ends and the roadways split into parallel one-way streets. North of the one-way transition, the Calgary Trail and Gateway Boulevard become arterial roadways with numerous retail and commercial services located between the two roadways. The first set of traffic signals is at 34 Avenue, and it continues north to Whitemud Drive, where Highway 2 continues along Whitemud Drive west. North of Whitemud Drive and 51 Avenue at 54 Avenue is the transition where southbound 104 Street becomes Calgary Trail. Gateway Boulevard and 104 Street pass through mixed light industrial and commercial areas before entering Old Strathcona and intersects Whyte (82) Avenue. Gateway Boulevard and 104 Street end at Saskatchewan Drive at the edge North Saskatchewan River valley. North of University Avenue, 104 Street is a two-way street with a northbound bus-only lane between University Avenue and 83 Avenue, and being a conventional two-way street between 83 Avenue and Saskatchewan Drive. Calgary Trail (104 Street) and Gateway Boulevard function as the major connection between downtown Edmonton and the Edmonton International Airport; however, they do not directly connect with downtown or cross the North Saskatchewan River. Inbound traffic via Gateway Boulevard and Saskatchewan Drive can be accessed via Queen Elizabeth Park Road which connects with the Walterdale Bridge, or alternatively continuing along Saskatchewan Drive which connects with the James MacDonald Bridge and Low Level Bridge. The main outbound route via 104 Street (Calgary Trail) can be accessed via 109 Street and the High Level Bridge and then following Saskatchewan Drive to connect with southbound 104 Street.  History  The roadways are the remnant of the northern terminus of the Calgary and Edmonton Trail, a land transport route between the fur trading posts of Fort Edmonton and Fort Calgary, used as far back as the early 1800s. The roadways were originally part of central Strathcona and conformed to the former city's quadrant numbering system, as such 104 Street (Calgary Trail) was known as Main Street and was the division between the west and east quadrants (Whyte Avenue was the division between the north and south quadrants), while Gateway Boulevard was known as 1st Street E. In 1912, Edmonton and Strathcona amalgamated Edmonton adopted its present numbering system; Main Street was renamed as 104 Street while 1st Street E was renamed as 103 Street. As Alberta's highway system developed, 104 Street became part of Highway 1 (renumbered to Highway 2 in 1941) to the 54 Avenue area before shifting to the southeast and continuing south along the CP rail line Edmonton-Calgary line and aligned with 103 Street, going by the name of Calgary Trail. The City of Edmonton commissioned the 1963 Metro Edmonton Transportation Study (METS) to address the need for free-flow traffic corridors and more river crossings in the downtown area. The plan proposed a downtown freeway loop with feeder routes, including three southern approaches via Calgary Trail and 111 Street and 91 Street / Mill Creek Ravine. The transition from 104 Street to Calgary Trail was converted to a split intersection at 51 Avenue, and included partial access 103 Street, which had become a collector road adjacent to the CP rail line. The freeway proposal through the North Saskatchewan River valley and its feeder ravines proved to be very controversial, with public protests suspending construction. In tandem with cost overruns, the majority of project was cancelled in 1974. In the early 1980s, 103 Street, 104 Street, and Calgary Trail were converted to one-way streets, with 104 Street carrying southbound traffic while 103 Street and Calgary Trail (renamed as Calgary Trail Northbound) carrying northbound traffic. As part of the project, a parallel, one-way roadway was constructed from the 104 Street / Calgary Trail transition to the 31 Avenue area and designated as Calgary Trail Southbound. The split intersection at 51 Avenue was partially removed (now the site of a Real Canadian Superstore) while the original transition alignment was designated as 54 Avenue. In 2001, Calgary Trail Northbound/103 Street and Calgary Trail Southbound were renamed as Gateway Boulevard and Calgary Trail respectively, initially the name change met with some controversy. Highway 2 used to enter Edmonton and abruptly transition from a freeway to an arterial roadway with traffic signals at Ellerslie Road and 23 Avenue; however the intersections were upgraded when interchanges were completed in 2001 and 2011 respectively. Calgary Trail and Gateway Boulevard have been synonymous Highway 2 in Edmonton. Originally, Highway 2 followed Calgary Trail and 104 Street to Whyte (82) Avenue before turning west to 109 Street, then crossing the High Level Bridge and eventually connecting with St. Albert Trail. In the mid-1980s, in an effort to bypass downtown, the Highway 2 designation was moved to Whitemud Drive; however, \\"To Highway 2 south\\" guide signs still frequent Calgary Trail.  Future  There have been proposals to improve the Gateway Boulevard connection with the Walterdale Bridge and downtown Edmonton by removing a hairpin turn required to access Queen Elizabeth Park Road. Due to the topography of the river valley, proposals have shown that Gateway Boulevard would have to be realigned in pass under Saskatchewan Drive. There is no finalized alignment or timeline for construction.

Structure The C19orf70 gene is located on the p arm of chromosome 19 at position 13.3 and it spans 2,482 base pairs. The C19orf70 gene produces a 9.7 kDa protein composed of 88 amino acids. Function The C19orf70 gene encodes for a subunit of the MICOS (mitochondrial contact site and cristae junction organizing system) complex of the mitochondrial inner membrane. The 700-kD complex plays diverse roles such as the maintenance of crista junctions, formation of contact junctions to the outer membrane, and the dynamic regulation of mitochondrial membrane architecture. C19orf70, a component of the mature MICOS complex, localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane at the cristae junctions and incorporates MINOS1 and MIC10 into the MICOS complex. The protein is necessary for the creation of the cristae junction, integrity of the cristae junction, and maintenance of cristae morphology. It is also essential for normal mitochondrial function. Clinical Significance Mutations in C19orf70 has been shown to result in mitochondrial deficiencies and related disorders caused by the disassembly of MICOS complex with abnormal cristae morphology and failure of mitochondrial respiration. Major clinical manifestations have included mitochondrial hepato- encephalopathy and 3-methylglutaconic aciduria accompanied by severe psychomotor retardation, intractable seizures, cerebellar atrophy, early death, Lactic acidemia, neutropenia, and elevated liver transaminases. Interactions C19orf70 has been known to interact with MRPL24, APOOL,STOML2,IMMT,MTX1,CHCHD3, and other proteins.

Attack  Two trucks filled with explosives blew up at the AMISOM military camp in Bula Marer, 110 km south of Mogadishu. Then about 100 Al-Shabaab militants attacked the base with gunfire. Another suicide bomber rammed his vehicle packed with explosives into a military convoy carrying Ugandan soldiers from Golweyn. According to the Deputy Governor of Lower Shabelle region Ali Nur Mohamed, AMISOM troops destroyed the vehicle with a rocket propelled grenade. The militants also attacked a third AMISOM base in Barawe with mortars and launched infantry attacks on two Somali government positions in Qoryoley and Mashallay. These attacks were reportedly intended to distract the troops in those camps from supporting the forces in Bulo Marer. Witnesses said Al-Shabaab terrorists attacked civilians and set houses and shops on fire after they raided the military base. Ali Nur Mohamed told VOA Somali that AMISOM and Somali troops repulsed all attacks.  Casualties  The death toll was not clear. Uganda People's Defense Force spokesman Richard Karemire said four Ugandan peacekeepers were killed and six AMISOM troops injured. Thirty Al-Shabaab terrorists were killed according to his reports. Al-Shabaab's military operations spokesperson Abdiaziz Abu Mus'ab said that the group lost only 14 fighters and killed at least 59 African Union soldiers.

Shapur Shahbazi, Erich Kettenhofen, John R. Perry, ‚ÄúDEPORTATIONS,‚Äù Encyclop√¶dia Iranica, VII/3, pp. 297-312, available online at http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/deportations (accessed on 30 December 2012). It was reportedly about one day's walk from Ctesiphon. The Persians used deportation as a tool of policy. Khosrow I captured Antioch in 540 during the Byzantine‚ÄìSasanian wars; the city was destroyed and its population was deported to this new city. According to Jacob of Edessa, prisoners-of-war from the cities of Sura, Beroea, Antioch, Apamea, Callinicum, and Batnai in Osrhoene were deported to this new city. It may be identical with MƒÅh≈çzƒì ·∏§…ô·∏èattƒÅ (literally \\"the New City\\") in the Syriac conciliar acts. Procopius has provided detailed information on the building of the city, though his primary source is pro-Sasanian. According to al-Tabari and al-Tha'alibi, the city was built on the plan of the Syrian metropolis and Khosrow I did everything in his power to make the residents want to stay. He provided Weh Antiok Khosrow with Roman baths and a circus. He also settled charioteers in the city. The city was governed by BarƒÅz, a Christian from Gundeshapur. The city was captured by the invading Arab Muslims under Khalid ibn Urfuta. Later in the Abbasid period, Caliph Al-Mansur used the city as his seat for a few months.

He owned the trading house C. S. Blacks Enke & Co. from 1783. The Erichsen Mansion in Copenhagen is named after him. Early life and education Erichsen was born in Odense, the son of war and district commissioner and chamberlain Laurids Erichsen (1716‚Äì56) and Charlotte Christiane von Westen (1724‚Äì1801). He completed a merchant's apprenticeship in Copenhagen. Career After completing his apprenticeship, Erichsen was employed in the Blach trading house. He became part of the management of the company after C. S. Blach's death in 1781. He married Blach's widow in 1783 and thus became the owner of the company that changed its name to C. S. Blachs Enke & Co. He was also involved in money lending. His ships brought spices and precious textiles home from the Rast Indies and transported grain from the Baltic countries to England. His fleet consisted of 13 ships in 1797. Erichsen's shipping enterprise encountered adversities from circa 1800. Several of his ships were captured by privaters. Erichsen responded by increasingly engaging in banking. He provided the Danish government with huge loans in 1808‚Äì12 and again in 1819 and the 1820s. Erichsen's brother Peter Erichsen was for many years a partner in the company. His sons joined it in 1816. Their lack of business talent and devastating life style led the company to ruin. It went bankrupt in 1833. Erichsen was a member of Danish Asiatic Company's board of directors in 1783‚Äì92. He was managing director of Speciesbanken in 1791‚Äì1813 and a member of the board of representatives of the National Bank in 1818-25. He was a member of the Council of 32 Men in 1788‚Äì1806 and was president of Grosserer-Societet from its foundation in 1817. He was appointed to royal agent in 1782, Etatsr√•d in 1812 and Konferensr√•d in 1831. Property The Erichsen Mansion today Erichsen constructed the Erichsen Mansion at Holmens Kanal in 1799-1801.

After the resignation of Nikoloz I Gulaberisdze he was appointed as Catholicos-Patriarch of All Georgia. Following the death of George III the question of the legality of Queen Tamar's status was raised by the great feudal lords, but with the vigorous support of the patriarch Michael IV the question was settled in Tamar's favour..

The queen fully appreciated the negative effects of this act and endeavoured to remody the situation. But it was extremely difficult to fight Mikel Mirianisdze.

The 2 days' convention led to the formation of Assam's first major political party under the name and style of Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), and formally launched in Golaghat on 14 October 1985. After intense negotiations with the then New Delhi government, headed by the prime minister Rajiv Gandhi, the All Assam Students Union (AASU) agreed to sign‚Äìoff the Assam Accord with the government on 15 August 1985.  History The Indian National Congress mostly dominated the electoral history of Assam from the first election of 1952. For many years, the citizens of Assam were raising the demand for steps against the illegal foreign immigrants who had entered the state of Assam through the porous border, mostly from Bangladesh (erstwhile East Pakistan) and occupied areas of the state, thus threatening the economic, political, social and cultural existence of the indigenous people of the state. The All Assam Students Union (AASU), under the leadership of Prafulla Kumar Mahanta (President) and late Bhrigu Kumar Phukan (General Secretary), and the All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad (AAGSP), reached out to the union Government of India demanding removal of several million illegal infiltrators from across the borders. This rapidly turned into a social movement throughout the state, and the Assam Movement was born in 1979. Continued for six long years until 15 August 1985 when it culminated with signing of Assam Accord, led to a realization of constitutional, legislative and administrative safeguards. for Assam among the participants and Assamese citizens, resulting the Golaghat Convention. The convention held for 2 days, highlighted the regional aspirations that emerged out of the Assam Movement and formally recorded as part of the Assam Accord and emphasized the need to consolidate political power in Assam's politics by instituting a major regional political party. Thus, AASU transformed itself into Asom Gana Parishad (AGP) on 14 October 1985 in Golaghat. AASU's President Prafulla Kumar Mahanta was elected as the President of the AGP. Smaller parties and organisations such as Asom Jatiyabadi Dal, Purbanchaliya Loka Parishad and Asam Sahitya Sabha regrouped with the AGP. The AGP swept the 1985 Assembly elections, thereby forming the government in Assam that year.  Principles  The base for the electoral realignment, leading to the formation of AGP in this convention, was set up via the principles of Assam Movement of 1979‚Äì85. Thus, the core principles of the convention were, but not limited to the following: #Regain Assam's political control via detection of the foreigners who have infiltrated into Assam since independence and to deport them to Bangladesh. #Develop Assam, envisioning, Sonor Assam (English translation: Golden Assam), signifying prosperity.

Carranza is the current New York City Schools Chancellor of the New York City Department of Education. He was appointed by Mayor de Blasio after Alberto M. Carvalho publicly turned down the job in March 2018. He previously served as the superintendent of the Houston Independent and the San Francisco Unified School Districts. Early life and education Carranza is the son of Mexican day immigrants, a sheet metal worker and a hairdresser and credits his public school education for putting him on a path to college and a successful career. He earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in secondary education from the University of Arizona and a Master of Education with distinction in educational leadership from Northern Arizona University. He has completed his doctoral coursework through Northern Arizona University and is currently pursuing a doctorate of education through Nova Southeastern University in Davie, Florida in educational leadership. Career He began his career as a high school bilingual social studies and mariachi music teacher, and then as a principal, both in Tucson, Arizona. Carranza was the Northwest Region superintendent for the Clark County School District in Las Vegas. He served the San Francisco Unified School District, first as deputy superintendent and then as superintendent, where he was accused in 2015 of creating a hostile environment for women. =Houston Independent School District= He was the superintendent of the Houston Independent School District (HISD) beginning in fall 2016. Carranza, who had signed a contract to serve for three years, served in this capacity until April 2018, when he was hired as New York City Schools Chancellor with a $345,000 salary. He announced his acceptance of the new job in March of that year. Observers in the Houston area were not aware that Carranza was seeking to exit his position with HISD: He publicly stated that he and the board members of HISD did not have problems with one another. Doris Delaney, a monitor of HISD appointed by the Texas Education Agency (TEA), wrote a report stating that the former superintendent in fact disliked and felt frustration in reaction to actions taken by HISD board members. The report stated that Carranza disliked how the board was unable to deliberate important issues, overstepped its authority, and included members with inappropriate political desires. =New York City= In 2018, the de Blasio administration initiated a plan to eliminate New York City's specialized high school exam, which is available to all middle school students in the city. In June 2018, defending the plan, Carranza stated that ‚ÄúI just don‚Äôt buy into the narrative that any one ethnic group owns admission to these schools.‚Äù Asian- American groups decried this as anti-Asian racism, considering that a disproportionately large number of students admitted to the city‚Äôs eight specialized schools are of Asian descent. They believe their children are being targeted for their success on the exam. Alumni, activists and Asian American groups argued that Chancellor Carranza failed to appreciate the socio-economic and other diversity among these students and internal to communities of Asian descent. Carranza refused to apologize for the remarks. In June 2019 nine members of the New York City Council wrote a letter to Mayor Bill DeBlasio asking him to dismiss Carranza, accusing him of having divisive actions. In response, twenty-three Councilmembers, including the education committee chair, sent a letter to the mayor in support of Carranza. In May 2020, it was reported that under Carranza, the Department of Education downplayed the coronavirus threat as it was closing schools. Students presumed sick from the virus were left unrecorded, and teachers and parents were deprived of information by supervisors on students and staff who were presumed sick. The teachers union contend that the DOE was not complying with state protocols. As of May 11, 74 NYC Department of Education employees had died due to Covid-19.

The concept was first used by Chilean company Aguas Andinas‚Äô CEO, Narc√≠s Berberana. Yves Lesty, Carlos Castro and Lisette Gajardo were the engineers that took part in its origin. Overall, biofactories have gone from a lineal processing approach, where resources are extracted and then processed, thus generating waste; to factories that supply with new valuable resources, such as electricity, natural gas, agricultural fertilizer or clean water, which are obtained from what it used to be considered as waste. The first biofactory complex was created in 2017 by Aguas Andinas, when this new strategy was applied to its different wastewater treatment plants, La Farfana and Mapocho-Trebal; and La Florida water treatment plant, grouping them all together under the name of Biofactor√≠a Gran Santiago. During its first year, Biofactor√≠a Gran Santiago generated a total of 51.792.240 kWh of electrical energy, 160.337 BTU of biogas, 111.842 tonnes of fertilizer destined to agricultural crops, and 603 millions cubic metre of clean water that was returned to its natural sources. Principles According to the company that coined this new concept, biofactories operate under 6 main principles: # Water run: Using the energy of water as a resource, they create new opportunities for its use after being cleaned; such as irrigation and underwater aquifer refill. # Run with its own energy: Using a renewable source such as water, the main objective of a biofactory is to take over the total amount of its operations‚Äô electrical requirements and feed its own system, both as energy and as biomethane. # Waste transformation: They understand waste as a source of new resources, such as the mud that comes from the process of wastewater cleaning, which is used as agricultural fertilizer. # Air protection: Within its facilities, they have deodorization systems that neutralize the odour, they reduce gas emission, and they take over the reforestation of its surroundings; minimizing its environmental impact. # Biodiversity protection: They promote initiatives that generate an optimal ecosystem for wildlife. A few of them are the cleansing of rivers contaminated with wastewater, the preservation of its environment, and the creation of artificial lakes that aim to protect the same environment. # Social involvement: #* Community engagement: Funding of social initiatives. #* Collaboration with other companies: Boosting of projects that deal with the processing of water that comes from other areas. #* Research: Enhancing both biotechnology and process engineering investigations. Acknowledgements In September 2018, Aguas Andinas‚Äô biofactory project was awarded with the Momentum for Change recognition, given by the United Nations (UN) during its Climate Change conference; acknowledging its contribution to this new strategy that seeks to prevent climate change. Furthermore, in October 2018, Chilean foundation Recycl√°polis gave its Recycl√°polis Environmental National Award to Biofactor√≠a Gran Santiago‚Äôs biomethanation plant, implemented by Chilean companies Metrog√°s and Aguas Andinas.

This concept is applied in serial production and mainly used in the automotive industry to plan, control and monitor production and delivery.H. L√∂dding: Verfahren der Fertigungssteuerung. Springer Verlag, 2008, Kap. 13 The concept is sometimes called 'Cumulative Production Figures Principle' (CPGP). P. Sch√∂nsleben: Integral Logistics Management ... , Taylor & Francis, 2016, Chap. 6.5  Closed-loop-cycle  The Concept of Cumulative Quantities (CCQ) uses the feedback mechanism of a closed loop, which can be found in industrial, engineering and electronic systems. The target requirements are summarized for each time-interval and compared with the actual values for closed-loop control. Positive cumulative deviation for a certain time-interval requires no further order, while negative deviations require a new order. To \\"calm\\" production and material flow upper and lower tolerance boundaries are defined and only if these boundaries are violated is a renewed order. To check the entire production and material flow 'reporting limits' can be defined at a chosen counting point and if a limit is exceeded a concerned 'alert' is issued. The logistics staff has to explain the reason for the 'alert'. If the reason is correct and traceable no further action is needed. If mistakes are present in the database, data processing or in data- acquisition appropriate counter-measures are needed. Examples for mistakes or failures wrong primary demand or bad forecasting, mistakes in Bill of Material or master data, old Master Production Schedule, inaccurate or delayed data acquisition, calculation mistakes, mounting of incorrect parts at assembly line.  Counting points  Target-actual-control-loop uses exactly defined counting points that demarcate the next-following intervals along the supply chain.Paul Sch√∂nsleben: Integrales Logistikmanagement, Springer Vieweg Verlag, 7. Aufl., 2016, S. 308 The cumulative differences of next-following counting points show the quantities of material items which traverse the Interval and therefore offer transparency of the inventory of an item along the entire supply chain.  Supply chain  Cumulative quantities are a part of official EDI-formats (e.g. EDIFACT - DELFOR) that are widely used by OEMs and their suppliers. Normally the data acquisition at 'goods receipt' are used for communication between consignee and goods dispatcher. Using the CCQ for the entire supply chain a Bullwhip effect can be avoided.W.

Plot London book dealer Emmett Leigh discovers a love letter, written from Tom to Ben, in a World War II-era book of poetry, Time Was by E.L. After selling the book and posting the letter to online war history groups, Emmett is contacted by Thorn Hildreth, who produces a 1941 diary entry from her great-grandfather, Rev Anson Hildreth, which mentions close friends Tom and Ben at the Heliopolis Club in Alexandria, and is accompanied by photos of the men. Emmett's friend Shahrzad Hejazi at the Imperial War Museum in London recalls and finds a photo of Tom and Ben taken in July 1915, as well as an eyewitness account of them, identified by name, disappearing together into an otherworldly portal. Shahrzad also retrieves a photo of them from a documentary shot in Bosnia in 1995, in which they seem only a decade or so older than the one taken in 1915. Emmett and Thorn hypothesize that Tom and Ben are \\"emortal\\"‚Äîthey age slowly, but are not immortal, in that they can die. Emmett and Thorn‚Äînow lovers themselves‚Äîtravel to Paris to retrieve the copy of Time Was Emmett sold. They learn that the old bookstores which possess copies of the book have generations-old instructions to never sell them, and to pass them along to other bookshops should theirs close. In addition to the one sold by Emmett, the Paris bookstore has their own copy, in which Emmett and Thorn find a letter from Ben to Tom, written in Nanking in 1937. They realize that the men are time travelers, and use the books to communicate. Emmett determines that all known copies of Time Was are held by five bookshops across the world, in Paris, Lisbon, New York, Brussels, and Rome. With further research online and at museums, he discovers multiple traces of Tom and Ben throughout the 19th and 20th century, the earliest of which is in 1856. His obsession with the project has a negative impact on his health. Applying quantum mechanics to the fact that the highest incidence of traces of the men is between 1935 and 1949, Emmett deduces that they are time travelers from the past, not the future. Watching the documentary, Thorn's grandfather, Leland, is able to identify Tom's accent as coming from Woodbridge, Suffolk. This leads Emmett to a purported 1980 UFO sighting at RAF Woodbridge, and a 1940s incident at a hamlet named Shingle Street, which Emmett guesses is Tom and Ben's departure point. In the early 1940s, Royal Engineer Tom Chappell and Royal Air Force scientist Ben Seligman, a new arrival to RAF Bawdsey, lock eyes at a pub. They are soon romantically involved, in secret. A test of Ben's secret military project, seeking cloaking technology, appears successful, which leads to a larger attempt. This experiment creates a time vortex into which Tom and Ben are drawn. In the present, Regenbald Howe, the caretaker of the Martello tower at Shingle Street, knows of Chappell and Seligman, who were stationed at RAF Bawdsey during World War II. He produces a diary, left anonymously for the Chappell family in 1980, in which Tom describes a military scientific experiment gone awry. Regenbald has also amassed countless eyewitness accounts, personal notes, and legends about the event. Over the next few years, the Paris and Brussels bookstores close, but Emmett keeps track of their copies of Time Was, both in Rome. He reads of a strange storm in Cyprus, which he believes to be one of Tom and Ben's portals. Tom arrives at one of the bookshops, and recognizes a stunned Emmett as the E.L. who wrote Time Was. Sometime in the near future, Emmett will become a time traveler himself, and meet a young Tom before the experiment. Emmett tells Tom that Ben died in a ship sunk by torpedoes.

History The company was founded by Oluf Blach (1694-1767) in 1727. It traded on the Danish colonies, especially the Danish West Indies. Blach served as managing director of the General Trading Company from 1767. After Blach's death in 1767 the company was continued by his son Christen Schaarup Black (1737-1783). He established a partnership with Niels Ryberg in the 1760s but it ended in 1775. He died just 46 years old in 1781. His widow, Johanne Black (1747-800), married Erich Erichsen in 1783.

During the Second World War (1939‚Äì1945), the Gambia was part of the British Empire as the Gambia Colony and Protectorate. At the outbreak of war between the British Empire and Nazi Germany in September 1939, the Gambia was home to the Gambia Company of the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF).  Risk of invasion  After the Fall of France in 1940, the Gambia's neighbour Senegal aligned with the pro-German Vichy France regime. In September 1940, the Allies attempted but failed to capture Senegal in the Battle of Dakar. The failure of this increased the risk of an Axis invasion of the Gambia.Hughes and Perfect, p. 223 In 1941, Lord Lloyd, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, asked for General Staff to draw up an Appreciation on Africa. In February 1941, this was completed and sent to Lloyd and Anthony Eden, the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. It made an assessment on the defence of British possessions in Africa, and stated that \\"The Gambia is not one of our essential possessions, and its capture by an enemy would not materially harm our prestige.\\" The report noted that its proximity to Dakar made it \\"particularly vulnerable to attack by Vichy\\" and called for plans to be drawn up in the event of an attack, including an evacuation scheme. Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord, partially objected to the assessment of the Gambia's importance. In a letter dated 3 March 1941, he wrote: \\"While this may be strictly true, Bathurst is of some naval value as a fuelling point for naval vessels of low endurance which cannot reach Freetown, and the Admiralty is erecting oil fuel stores there.\\" The Chiefs of Staff Committee approved a report by the Joint Planning Staff on the evacuation of the Gambia at a meeting on 22 March 1941.  Home front  = Home defence = The Gambia Local Defence Volunteers were founded in the war. It was later renamed as the Gambia Home Guard. The Gambia Naval Volunteer Force, part of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (RNVR), was raised in 1935. In March 1938, it had six officers - five lieutenants, and Lieutenant Commander Alexander Skinner, the commanding officer. = Domestic politics = On 13 November 1941, members of the Bathurst Advisor Town Council (BATC) voted for Edward Francis Small to be appointed to the Legislative Council to replace the late W. D. Carrol. Small served from 1 January 1942, becoming the first Gambian member elected to the Legislative Council.Hughes and Perfect, p. XXIV = Governance = At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Thomas Southorn was the Governor of the Gambia, having been appointed to the role in October 1936. In March 1942, Hilary Blood was appointed as Governor and continued to serve until March 1947. = Economy = In 1940, the British passed the Colonial Development and Welfare Act 1940, which provided funding to research efforts in the colonies. In July 1941, a commission of inquiry was launched to investigate the wages of manual labourers in the Gambia. It was decided that a minimum wage for workers in Bathurst should be set. Also, during the war, a full income tax was established in the Gambia along with other West African British territories. Kenneth Blackburne, then Colonial Secretary, published a report in 1943 that assessed the long-term and immediate economic needs of The Gambia. It examined how best to use post-war funds from the Colonial Development and Welfare Act. Many of its recommendations were ignored, but it served as a blueprint for development from 1945 to 1950.Hughes and Perfect, p. 22  Domestic military presence  = RAF Bathurst = RAF Bathurst was formed in March 1941. It initially included three bases of operation, at Half-Die, Jeswang, and Yundum. A detachment from the anti-submarine No. 95 Squadron RAF was based at Bathurst from March 1941 to March 1943, before relocating wholly to Bathurst and remaining there until 30 June 1945. No. 95 Squadron was created to operate Short Sunderland flying boat patrol bombers. The biggest threat that the Squadron faced were Vichy French fighter aircraft based in Senegal, so in July 1941 it formed a Hawker Hurricane fighter wing. In October 1941, this fighter wing became No. 128 Squadron RAF. A detachment of this Squadron was based in Jeswang from October 1941 to March 1943. Other units based at RAF Bathurst include No. 228 Squadron RAF, from 28 August to 26 October 1941, and a detachment from No. 270 Squadron RAF from November 1942 to July 1943. On 11 November 1943, a Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve (RAFVR) Catalina IB with the callsign FP122 crashed in the river while coming in to land at RAF Bathurst. All five crewmembers were killed.RAF personnel at RAF Bathurst. = RAF Yundum = RAF Yundum was primarily home to No. 200 Squadron RAF. It was also home to No. 82 Squadron, No. 128 Squadron, No. 541 Squadron, the HQ of No. 295 Wing, and No. 54 Staging Post. The airfield is now Banjul International Airport. = Medical aid and hospitals = The Gambia was home to a number of military hospitals during the Second World War. 55 British General Hospital was stationed in Bathurst from April 1941 to May 1942, 40 British General Hospital was stationed there from May 1942 to May 1943, and 55 British General Hospital was again stationed in Bathurst from January 1945 to January 1946. A Red Cross Committee was also founded in the Gambia in order to assist British soldiers detained in French West Africa.  Gambia Regiment  The Gambia Regiment was formed out of the Gambia Company of the Royal West African Frontier Force (RWAFF) in 1940. Originally at battalion strength, in 1941 a second battalion was also raised. The 1st Battalion served in the Burma Campaign from 1944 to 1945.Hughes and Perfect, p. 80  1943 visit of Franklin D. Roosevelt  Soldiers of the Gambia Regiment on patrol in Burma, 1945. In 1943, Franklin D. Roosevelt visited the Gambia, the first visit by a sitting President of the United States to the African continent.  Connection to HMS Gambia  The Colony-class light cruiser HMS Gambia, which saw active service during World War II, took its name from the colony. It maintained a connection with the Gambia throughout its service, and on 28 May 1943, called at Bathurst when it was en route to Cape Town.

It separated from the adjacent Peerdsbos forest by the E19 highway to the North.  History  The Vordenstein domain was created it the 14th century out of the Hof ter Katen and the Hof van de Werve. At that time, the domain had a mainly agrarian function, with the feudal lord leasing patches of the land to various farmers. Starting in the 18th century, the domain gradually evolved into a recreational estate with a castle and an extensive pleasure garden, owned by a succession of wealthy families from Antwerp as a countryside retreat. In 1980 the majority of the park was eventually bought by the Belgian state, and subsequently opened to the public. A smaller part in the middle of the domain remains privately owned by the De Pret family that inherited the domain at the beginning of the 20th century.  Layout  The majority of the present day layout stems from the 18th and 19th centuries. The oldest part of the park, the so-called Sterrenbos in the northeastern corner, was laid out in a baroque and geometrical fashion, inspired by the French gardens of Versailles. At the end of the 18th century, a forest in romantic style was planted in the middle of the park. The southwestern part of the domain was laid out in 1850 as an English landscape garden, with a pond, patches of trees and exotic plants. In the southeast lies the vegetable garden and the orangerie, which was built in the early 19th century, and is now used as a cafe. The forests in the northwest and the east were only planted at the end of the 19th century on what had been land used for farming.

It was broadcast on CBS from July 5, 1946, until February 7, 1948. Format In his book, On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio, radio historian John Dunning described Hawk Larabee as \\"radio's first half-hearted attempt at an adult western drama, a concept that was not fully realized until the arrival of Gunsmoke five years later.\\" Although adults listened to earlier radio westerns, such as The Lone Ranger and Red Ryder, the main audience for those programs was children. Another radio historian, Jim Cox, wrote in his book, Say Goodnight, Gracie: The Last Years of Network Radio, that Hawk Larabee \\"fell short in providing the stark realism of a grown-up narrative.\\" A summer replacement for The Adventures of Maisie, the program began as Hawk Durango, with the main character having that name. Those episodes focused on the adventures of Durango and his partner, Brazos John. After six weeks, the program ended. On October 3, 1946, Hawk Larabee debuted, with the title character being the owner of Black Mesa Ranch. Larabee and his partner, Somber Jones, encountered adventures in and around the town of Sundown Wells. Larabee often found himself accused of crimes that he had not committed and thus had to solve the crimes to save himself from misfortune. Personnel The changes in title and format were accompanied by a change in who had the title role. Elliott Lewis played Hawk Durango, with Barton Yarborough as Brazos John. In the Hawk Larabee program, Yarborough played the title role, while Barney Phillips portrayed Somber Jones. James Matthews was the announcer. William N. Robson was producer and director, and Richard Sanville was assistant director. Writers were Gomer Cool, E. Jack Neuman, Arthur E. Orlock, Dean Owen, and Kenneth Perkins. Music was by Wilbur Hatch, and episodes incorporated singing by the Texas Rangers quartet. They sang the theme and provided bridges and background music for the broadcasts. Each episode also included three one- minute arrangements of songs in case some local stations wanted to insert commercials for the otherwise unsponsored program. In later episodes, Andy Parker's Plainsmen replaced the Texas Rangers.

Early years Adolphe Cic√©ron was born in Blois, Loir-et-Cher, on 28 May 1853. His parents were Adolphe Cic√©ron (1805‚Äì1872) and Th√©r√®se Alexandrine Adeline Rodrigue. He had three full sisters, and one half sister by his father's first wife. His father was a notary. His father had been appointed on 27 February 1840 to serve Saint-Fran√ßois, Guadeloupe, then on 4 April 1846 to Le Moule, Guadeloupe. A decree of 20 December 1852 reinstated the elder Adolphe Cic√©ron as notary in Le Moule. Ciceron also became a notary, but set up his practice in Pointe-√†-Pitre, Guadeloupe, in 1878. He was elected a municipal councillor of Pointe-√†-Pitre in 1885, and was made deputy mayor. In 1886 he was elected to the general council of Guadeloupe, and in 1896 became president of the general council of the department of Guadeloupe. Senator Ciceron was elected to the senate for Guadeloupe in the first round on 7 January 1900 in a by-election. He won 186 votes out of 285. He sat with the Democratic Left group. Cic√©ron was in favour of reform of the colonial government and of a specific constitution for the colonies. He often spoke in debates about the colonies, calling for treatment of the old colonies to be the same as metropolitan departments, and for irremovable colonial magistrates. He was involved in debates over the tariffs on coffee in 1900, and prepared reports on the bill to extend the privileges of the colonial banks and on the bill to allow Pointe-√†-Pitre to borrow money. Ciceron was reelected in the triennial renewal of the senate on 4 January 1903, again in the first round, by 189 votes against 95 for his opponent. He participated in debates over the proposed law on army recruitment and on the budgets of the colonies and the navy. In 1910 he was rapporteur on subsidies granted to local budgets and reorganization of the Martinique communes after the 1902 earthquake. On 5 July 1910 he protested against the pressure the administration had exerted during the Guadeloupe legislative elections, and opposed sending a cruiser to the island. He was rapporteur of the colonial budget for 1911, and demanded equality in exchange of products with metropolitan France and improvements in customs arrangements, agricultural credits and port facilities. Last years Ciceron ran for election in the renewal of 7 January 1912, but was defeated by Henry B√©renger. Ciceron claimed that there had been electoral corruption by an unknown person, and said that Alexandre Saverdat, general councillor and agent of H√©g√©sippe L√©gitimus, had received 50,000 francs by telegraph on 6 January 1912. Despite the challenge, on 13 December 1912 the senate finally decided that B√©renger had won. Ciceron died in Saint-Claude, Guadeloupe, on 13 May 1928 at the age of 75.

Chronology  Monument near the Pontlatzer Bridge St. Anne's Column in Innsbruck On 19 June 1703, Bavarian troops besieged Kufstein. Fires broke out on the outskirts of the town, which engulfed the town itself, destroyed it and reached the powder store of the supposedly impregnable fortress. The enormous supplies of gunpowder exploded and Kufstein surrendered on 20 June. That same day, the Tyrolese surrendered in W√∂rgl; two days later Rattenberg was captured und Innsbruck was cleared on 25 June without a fight. But the Bavarians then suffered reverses at the hands of the Tyrolese on 1 July at the Pontlatzer Bridge in the upper Inn Valley, at the Brenner Pass and near Innsbruck. On 26 July, Saint Anne's Day, Tyrol was freed again and Maximilian Emanuel retreated to Bavaria via Seefeld in Tirol. In 2011, during construction work in Pfons in the Wipptal valley, graves were uncovered, which were presumably those of Bavarian soldiers, who were not buried in the cemetery, but in threes near the river bank. The theory rests on clues that were mentioned in the local chronicle of Matrei am Brenner.Knochenfund von Pfons ist √ºber 300 Jahre alt at ORF dated 12 February 2011  Tradition  In gratitude for their freedom, in 1704 the Landst√§nde pledged to have a St. Anne's Column built and this was erected in Innsbruck in 1706. The Bavarian Rummel forms - together with the struggle for Tyrolean freedom in 1809, which regularly overshadows it both in expert and public discourse - was an important element of Tyrolean historical consciousness and Tyrolean identity and made a lasting contribution to the creation of the image of the \\"fighting Tyrolean farmer\\".Martin P.

The IBM 4765 is validated to FIPS PUB 140-2 Level 4, the highest level of certification achievable for commercial cryptographic devices. The IBM 4765 data sheet describes the coprocessor in detail. IBM supplies two cryptographic-system implementations: * The PKCS#11 implementation creates a high-security solution for application programs developed for this industry-standard API. * The IBM Common Cryptographic Architecture (CCA) implementation provides many functions of special interest in the finance industry, extensive support for distributed key management, and a base on which custom processing and cryptographic functions can be added. Toolkits for custom application development are also available. Applications may include financial PIN transactions, bank-to- clearing-house transactions, EMV transactions for integrated circuit (chip) based credit cards, and general-purpose cryptographic applications using symmetric key algorithms, hashing algorithms, and public key algorithms. The operational keys (symmetric or RSA private) are generated in the coprocessor and are then saved either in a keystore file or in application memory, encrypted under the master key of that coprocessor.

The season is produced by Fremulon, 3 Arts Entertainment, and Universal Television. The season concluded on January 24, 2019, and contained thirteen episodes. The series focuses on Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), a deceased young woman who wakes up in the afterlife and is welcomed by Michael (Ted Danson) to \\"the Good Place\\" in reward for her righteous life; however, she eventually discovers that Michael's \\"Good Place\\" is a hoax, and she is actually in the \\"Bad Place\\" being psychologically and emotionally tortured by her fellow afterlife residents. William Jackson Harper, Jameela Jamil, and Manny Jacinto co-star as other deceased human residents of the faux Good Place who are similarly being tormented, together with D'Arcy Carden as an artificial being helping the inhabitants. In the third season, the deceased humans have been returned to life on Earth to allow them another chance to improve morally, with some guidance from Michael. Each of the episodes is listed as \\"Chapter (xx)\\" following the opening title card. Cast =Main= Kristen Bell portrays series protagonist Eleanor Shellstrop. * Kristen Bell as Eleanor Shellstrop, a deceased, selfish saleswoman from Phoenix, Arizona who winds up in the Good Place by mistake.

Assigned as Eleanor's soulmate in Michael's first Good Place experiment, he gives her ethics lessons in an attempt to make her a better person. * Jameela Jamil as Tahani Al-Jamil, a deceased, wealthy English philanthropist who believes she belongs in the Good Place. She forms an unlikely friendship with Eleanor, who initially dislikes her positive attitude, condescending way of speaking, and tendency to name drop. * D'Arcy Carden as Janet, a programmed guide and knowledge bank who acts as the Good Place's main source of information and can provide its residents with whatever they desire. Later, Janet gains a more humanlike disposition, and begins to act differently than the way she was designed. ** Carden also plays Bad Janet, a disrespectful version of Janet designed not to respond to residents properly; Neutral Janet, an impartial, robotic version of Janet that works in the Accountant's Office; and, for one episode, Janet-versions of Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason. * Manny Jacinto as Jason Mendoza, a deceased amateur DJ and drug dealer from Jacksonville, Florida who winds up in the Good Place by mistake. He is introduced as Jianyu Li, a Taiwanese monk who took a vow of silence. Later, Jason proves to be an immature and unintelligent, but kindhearted Jacksonville Jaguars and Blake Bortles fan. * Ted Danson as Michael, an architect who runs the Good Place neighborhood in which Eleanor, Chidi, Tahani, and Jason reside. Michael has a deep affinity for the mundane aspects of human life, like playing with paper clips or searching for one's car keys. \\"Michael\\" is a Hebrew name meaning \\"who is like God?\\" =Recurring= * Marc Evan Jackson as Shawn, Michael's wicked boss. Shawn gives Michael two chances to pull off the torture experiment, and later turns against him when he finds out about Michael's betrayal. * Maya Rudolph as Judge Gen (short for Hydrogen), an eternal judge who rules on interdimensional matters between the Good Place and the Bad Place. * Kirby Howell-Baptiste as Simone Garnett, an Australian neuroscientist and, briefly, Chidi's girlfriend. * Mike O'Malley as Jeff, the gatekeeper of the doorway between the afterlife and Earth.

In 1974 the boards were abolished and replaced by regional health authorities. The county came under the Oxford RHA. Regions were reorganised in 1994 and Oxfordshire came under the Anglia and Oxford Regional Health Authority. Oxfordshire had two area health authorities from 1974 ‚Äì West Berkshire and Oxfordshire. In 1982 it had only one district health authority. Regional health authorities were reorganised and renamed strategic health authorities in 2002. Oxfordshire was part of Thames Valley SHA. In 2006 regions were again reorganised and Oxfordshire came under NHS South Central until that was abolished in 2013. There was only one primary care trust for the area. Sustainability and transformation plans The county is part of the Buckinghamshire, Oxfordshire and Berkshire West STP area. There are plans to replace the nine community hospitals in the county with four community hubs and to close 110 acute beds at Horton General Hospital. The Care Quality Commission reported in February 2018 that there were multiple problems with the inpatient discharge process. Over 71% of discharges were unplanned and some took place between 2am and 3am. Social care providers reported that they did not receive discharge summaries for over 50% of the patients referred to them. There was ‚Äúlittle collaboration between system partners‚Äù. Louise Patten was appointed the permanent chief executive of both Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire CCGs in January 2019, leading to suggestions that this might be followed by a merger. Commissioning Primary care There are 70 GP practices in the county. Acute services Acute services are provided by Oxford University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. There are two hospitals with accident and emergency facilities: the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford and the Horton General Hospital in Banbury. The former is a major trauma centre.

His main interests were in the area of deep sea research. Early life Freddy Marshall was born in the Cambridgeshire village of Great Shelford, where his family had lived for generations in a house built by his father; both his father and grandfather were builders. He was the eldest of four children, having two brothers and a sister. His father joined the Cambridgeshire Regiment and went to fight in the First World War in France before Freddy was born. From 1920 he attended the village's church school and in 1926 went to the Cambridge and County High School. During his school years Freddy was more interested in fishing than in his studies and narrowly avoided expulsion. However, he attained a Higher School Certificate with distinctions in zoology and botany. Cambridge and early career In 1933 Marshall entered Downing College, Cambridge as an exhibitor, supported by scholarships from both the Cambridgeshire County Council and the Board of Education. He gained a double first in the Natural Sciences Tripos, having read Zoology Part II. As an undergraduate he was interested in embryology and this led to him being introduced by his professor John Stanley Gardiner to E.S. Russell, whose book The Interpretation of Development and Heredity Marshall had admired. Russell at the time was Director of Fisheries Investigations at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries and they discussed fish biology but Marshall was set on pursuing his interest in embryology. However, Gardiner advised Freddy to broaden his horizons and introduced him to a Commander Hawkridge who had an office insuring fishing boats in Hull. Hawkridge was able to arrange berths for Marshall on fishing boats during his vacation, which allowed Marshall to visit the waters off Iceland three times and Bear Island and the Faroes once each. It was on these voyages that Marshall was first introduced to the macrourid fish on which he would become an authority. These trips may have had some influence on Marshall's decision to give up embryology and to apply for a post as a marine biologist in Hull. Marshall was appointed to be part of Alister Hardy's Department of Zoology and Oceanography at University College, Hull in 1937. Here he became involved in research on plankton and spent many hours working on the reels of bolting silk which were used by Hardy's plankton recorders. The plankton was trapped in the silk which was concealed inside artificial herrings dragged behind commercial ships. He was particularly looking for the two indicator species of arrow worms. He had been lodged in unsatisfactory accommodation in Hull and Jacob Bronowski suggested that Marshall move in to his lodgings. Here Marshall was given the nickname \\"Freddy\\" by Bronowski with whom he became friends and also met his landlady's daughter, Olga Stonehouse, whom he married in 1944. During his stay at these lodgings he also made friends with Cyril Lewis, who lived in the next street and, after Lewis moved to Edinburgh, Marshall stayed with him when he was posted to Hull's northern outpost in Leith. Army service Marshall was commissioned in to the Royal Army Ordnance Corps in 1941 and stationed on the Thames for a while before being transferred, like many other biologists, into operation research. In 1944 he was seconded from the Army to the Colonial Office for special duties. David Lack informed him that Operation Tabarin was looking for volunteers suitable for manning Antarctic bases. Operation Tabarin was a British operation to deny the use of Antarctic islands and mainland to Axis forces and to reinforce British claims in the region. Marshall contacted Brian Roberts who was coordinating the Operation and Roberts sent him to Canada to collect 25 huskies to be used in the Antarctic by the teams involved in Operation Tabarin. He flew to Labrador to collect the dogs on 19 September 1944, only ten days after his wedding to Olga. He returned to Liverpool on board a Free French cargo ship, the Indochinois accompanied by Surgeon Commander Edward W. Bingham, who had much more experience with huskies than Marshall. On arrival at Liverpool they and the dogs were transferred to the RSS John Biscoe to sail to the Antarctic, where he was based at Hope Bay as the zoologist. Post-war career When Marshall returned to Hull in September 1946 he was able to spend a lot of his time at the British Museum (Natural History) working on his collection of fish from his time in the Antarctic. In the summer of 1947 Marshall was appointed to the Department of Zoology at the Museum. He replaced J.R. Norman, who had died in post, as an Assistant Keeper. For the next 25 years Marshall worked at the BM(NH) becoming a Special Merit Senior Scientific Officer in 1962. He travelled widely during his time at the Museum, spending time in the United States and on oceanographic expeditions on a number of research vessels. Following advice from Albert Eide Parr he specialised in studying the swim bladder, especially that of deep-sea fish. He also conducted a well received series of lectures at Harvard University and worked at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 1963. He also worked at the University of Miami and the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. He was elected to Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1970. He was awarded the Polar Medal in 1953 and in 1971 the Rosenstiel Gold Medal for services to Marine Biology. In 1972, Marshall left his position at the museum to become the Chair of Zoology at Queen Mary College, London University and remained in that post until he retired in 1977. Marshall was the author of three major and influential books on marine biology, Aspects of deep-sea biology in 1954, Explorations in the lives of fishes in 1963 and Developments in deep sea biology in 1979. The text of these books written by Marshall was accompanied by illustrations by Olga. He was also the author of many scientific papers. Personal life Marshall married Olga Stonehouse on 9 September 1944 and they had one son, Justin, also a marine biologist, and three daughters. While Marshall was working in London they lived in Saffron Walden where their house was built by his architect brother, Peter, from bricks left from a ruined coach house that had occupied the site. He was keen on music and while staying with Lewis in Edinburgh had developed an interest in the music of Donald Tovey. He also played golf, enjoyed Bach and took an interest in many subjects. He was friends with Arthur Koestler who often came to visit him and discuss literature and philosophy. In 1996 Marshall and Olga moved to Great Chesterford in Essex where he died suddenly on 13 February 1996 while working on a new book about simplicity in biology. Legacy The grenadier Coryphaenoides marshalli and the needletooth cusk (Epetriodus freddyi) are named after him, as is Marshall Peak in Antarctica, which was so named by the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey in recognition of Marshall's work on Operation Tarabin.

But that desire she undo after her cousin, Fuad Hassan suggested that Shahab take a major in anthropology. The reason was because at that time students in anthropology majors are still few, only five to seven people only, so the chance to stand out will be greater. Shahab graduated with a bachelor's degree from the Faculty of Arts, University of Indonesia in 1975 with a thesis entitled Masalah Integrasi Minoritas Arab di Jakarta (The Problem of Integration of Arab Minorities in Jakarta). Then, the Master of Arts degree she took at the Australian National University in 1982 with a thesis entitled The Position of Betawi Women.

Plot The film consists of several storylines. Main one occurs in the USSR in the 1980s - a detective story about scammers who, using a police identification card, break into the apartments of dishonest people and rob them under the guise of a search. When studying this case, investigator Muromtsev discovers a conflict between two inventors of miracle drug metaproptozole, called abroad as \\"medicine against fear\\". The professor does not believe in the existence of this drug because he did not succeed in inventing it himself. Therefore, he denies that his opponent Lyzhin, who is considered a kooky eccentric could invent such a drug. However, the criminals manage to poison the district plenipotentiary with this particular drug, after which they abduct the identity card and the government-issue weapons of the district police officer Pozdnyakov. A parallel story tells about the life and tragic fate of the great physician and philosopher Paracelsus in the 16th century in Europe. In search of a mythical cure for all diseases, he makes discoveries, which form the basis of modern pharmacology. The life of Paracelsus is spent in constant wanderings.

It assumes that technology, humanity and religion can be integrated into one entity. As an anthropology theory, techno-animism examines the interactions between the material and the spiritual aspects of technology in relation to humans. Techno-animism has been studied in the context of Japan, since techno-animism traces most of its roots to the Shinto religion, and also in DIY culture where Actor‚Äìnetwork theory and non-human agencies have been labeled as techno-animist practices.Emit Snake- Beings 2017. Maker Culture and DiY technologies: re-functioning as a Techno- Animist practice. Continuum: Journal of Media and Cultural Studies, Australia. \\"https://doi.org/10.1080/10304312.2017.1318825\\"  Background and history  The deity of roads and borders represented in a human form. The practice of instilling human and spiritual characteristics into physical objects has always been part of the Shinto religion. Deities in the Shinto religion often symbolizes objects of the physical world and their statues often take human forms. With these practices, people form tighter bonds with physical objects. In Japanese culture, the interaction between humans and non-human objects is critical to the harmonious coexistence of humans and nature. A prime example of this type of interaction is that before meals, Japanese people always say \\"itadakimasu\\" which expresses gratitude for the ingredients of the meal may it be animals or plants. Techno-animism builds upon the practices of the Shinto religion by instilling human and spiritual characteristics into technology. As for representation, techno-animism is often embodied in the engineering design of objects and the way that people interact with those objects. In a larger social context, Techno-animism provides a means for technology to be integrated into the human society because new technology can always be instilled with traditional values.Tsurumi, K. (1992) Animism and Science. Research Papers series A-58, Institute of International Relations, Sophia University, Tokyo.

A robot designed by Honda called ASIMO takes the form of an astronaut wearing a spacesuit. The form factor along with the spiritual values associated with space exploration makes ASIMO an embodiment of techno-animism. In addition, ASIMO can also communicate with humans through language and gestures. Communication is a defining factor of determining whether something is an individual being or not.Kaplan, F. (2004) ‚ÄòWho is afraid of the humanoid? Investigating cultural differences in the acceptance of robots‚Äô, International Journal of Humanoid Robotics. 1(3): 1‚Äì16. In Japan, the robot industry offers a wide range of functions from talking robots to sex robots. Conversation and sexual relationships used to be concepts that only belonged to humans. However, technological advancements and techno-animism are breaking down that barrier with engineering designs that embodies human and spiritual characteristics. Beyond the design of objects, the way that people choose to interact with objects could also demonstrate techno-animism. In Shinjuku, Tokyo, there is a restaurant where the waiters are robots instead of humans. Rather than talking to another person, customers only interact with machines throughout the dining process. In this process, customers accept the fact that technology has become part of the human society and has a unique way of interacting with humans.  Social implications  Japanese culture and legislation are generally supportive of the techno- animism trend. Considering that Japan's modernization took place in a relatively short period of time in comparison to western nations, techno- animism is seen as a major reason why Japan has been one of the world's centers of technological innovations. As a result, acceptance of techno- animism is the current attitude in Japan both culturally and legislatively.

Early life Legg was born in Bournemouth on 18 April 1947. His parents, Ted and Gladys, were of Dorset ancestry, and had one older son. Legg attended primary school in Charminster, then Winton Boys School until age 16. As an adolescent he joined the League of Empire Loyalists, in which he participated for seven years, including making flag-waving protests at Conservative and Labour party conferences. Career After leaving school with five O-levels, Legg's first job was for the Basildon Standard in Essex, as a reporter. After four years he returned to Dorset and founded Dorset: The County Magazine in 1968, which later became Dorset Life. Legg led a campaign to restore public access to the army-occupied Lulworth Ranges in south Dorset, including the village of Tyneham that had been evacuated by command of the War Office in 1943 and never returned to its former residents. Known as the Tyneham Action Group, this campaign ‚Äì founded by Legg in 1967 ‚Äì eventually resulted in weekend access to ten square miles of land that were also secured from being ploughed or developed. Having joined the Open Spaces Society at age 16, Legg became treasurer in 1981 and chairman in 1989. He believed that all land should be publicly accessible; he opened Steep Holm island in Somerset to public access, after helping to buy it in 1976 in memory of his friend Kenneth Allsop. Legg was the island's warden for 25 years. In 1990 Legg became the Open Spaces Society's appointee on the council of the National Trust. He was critical of the Trust, calling it \\"an elitist club for art connoisseurs\\", and sought to change it from within. His complaint, based on years of experience of finding Trust land blocked to public access, caused debate in the national press. Legg published 125 books, including a collaborative edition ‚Äì with author John Fowles ‚Äì of John Aubrey's Monumenta Britannica (1980‚Äì1982). Personal life Legg's partner was Di Hooley.

It dates to the time of the earliest Portuguese settlers to the region. The dish consists of a platter of beans cooked in saut√©ed onion, garlic, fat, and salt; dried, toasted manioc flour; a pork chop; fried sausage; breaded and fried plantain; eggs, preferably with the soft yolk; kale, cut into strips and braised in fat; rice; and torresmo, a crisply cooked pork rind. Virado is traditionally served on Mondays. About 500,000 plates of the dish are served per week in the city of S√£o Paulo. History Virado arose spontaneously during the early colonial period of Brazil as a dish of the bandeirantes. The bandeirantes traveled to the interior of Brazil first to capture and enslave native Brazilians, and later to find gold, silver, and diamonds. They carried beans, pork, and corn flour in their backpacks to the interior of the state. Stored in the backpack, the ingredients \\"turned\\" (Portuguese: virar) and mixed, hence the name of the dish, \\"virado\\". Virado in the period of the bandeirantes consisted only of beans, usually cooked without salt so as not to harden, maize flour, dried meat, and bacon. Cassava flour was substituted for corn flour after the introduction of the crop to the S√£o Paulo region in the 18th century. The bandeirantes and other early settlers ate virado cold or warmed. The earliest written reference to virado is in 1602, when Nicolau Barreto made an expedition to present-day Paraguay, Bolivia, and Peru. It is also associated with the mon√ß√£o, who led expeditions by river into remote areas of the Brazilian interior from the early 18th to the early 19th century. The dish became a staple of homes and farmsteads in the S√£o Paulo region. Homes in S√£o Paulo in the early colonial period were severe and lacked the elegance of those in Bahia, Pernambuco, or Rio de Janeiro. Virado was served at all times of the day with little variation; in this period it consisted of beans, bacon, flour, a piece of pork, smoked lingui√ßa, and kale. Rice was introduced to virado in the 19th century after the wide-scale introduction to the crop in Brazil; it was cooked in the remains of cooked pork or sausage, and additionally flavored with lard, garlic, and salt. Dessert served with virado consisted of fresh fruit such as oranges; bananas fried with cinnamon and sugar were also common. Dom Pedro I ate virado on August 17, 1822 at Fazenda Pau d'Alho, in S√£o Jos√© do Barreiro, Vale do Para√≠ba on the trip from Rio de Janeiro to S√£o Paulo. Variations There are several variations of virado, either around the basic ensemble of pork, fried banana, beans mashed with cassava flour, rice, kale, and fried egg. The virado can be prepared with black beans and corn flour. An early variation of the dish emerged when the bandeirantes turned their expeditions to Minas Gerais, where the dish became known as tutu √† mineira. Tutu √† mineira differs from Virado in its use of ground beans; the version in S√£o Paulo uses whole beans. One variation served in the interior of the state of Santa Catarina substitutes cooked cabbage for kale.

Matthew Washington Kennedy (10 March 1921 ‚Äì 5 June 2014) was an American classical pianist, professor, choral director, composer, and arranger of Negro Spirituals.https://digitalscholarship.tnstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&context;=conference- on-african-american-history-and-culture He is widely known as the director of the historic Fisk Jubilee Singers of Nashville, Tennessee from 1957 to 1986. Early life and education Kennedy was born in Americus, Georgia, the fourth child of Royal Clement Kennedy and Mary Magdalene Dowdell. His father was a postal worker, and died of a heart attack when Matthew was 15 months old. Royal Clement‚Äôs parents had been slaves on the Kennedy Plantation near Andersonville, Georgia. Matthew‚Äôs mother was born to Joseph and Maria Dowdell in Sumter County, Georgia. She was a public school teacher. A child prodigy, he picked out the melodies on the piano of hymns and Spirituals he heard sung by his mother, and composed his first piano piece called ‚ÄúThe Bells‚Äù at age six. Kate Land agreed to give him piano lessons in exchange for having her house cleaned by Matthew and his cousin. The star of his own radio show at age 11, Matthew played the organ to accompany silent films at the segregated cinema where he was given the stage name ‚ÄúSunshine,‚Äù and was dressed in a bellhop uniform. In 1932, Matthew and his mother sat in the segregated balcony for a live concert given by famed Russian pianist Sergei Rachmaninoff in Macon, Georgia. Frustrated with the segregated South, Mary Kennedy decided to move with her son to New York City. Soon after they arrived, Matthew auditioned at the Juilliard School, and was admitted because of his imitation of Rachmaninoff‚Äôs playing style. Lois Adler gave him a personal scholarship for study in the Preparatory Division. He simultaneously studied and graduated from DeWitt Clinton High School, and earned a diploma in piano from Juilliard in 1940. His teacher Lois Adler advised Kennedy to return to the South for his college degree, and arranged for him to study at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee on scholarship. In 1940, Mrs. James A. Myers was director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers at the time, and she asked Kennedy to serve as piano accompanist for the group. From Fisk, Kennedy was drafted to serve in World War II, and was sent to North Africa and Southern France. After returning from the war, he graduated from Fisk University with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1947 (cum laude). Kennedy went on to earn his Master of Arts degree from Juilliard in 1950, and completed coursework toward his Ph.D. from George Peabody College in Nashville. Career Employed by Fisk University as an instructor in 1947, Kennedy became a member of its music faculty in 1954 as an associate professor. In 1956, he married pianist Anne Gamble. Kennedy was appointed director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers in 1957, and he mentored hundreds of young students for the next twenty-three years. In 1958, Kennedy made his own solo piano debut at Carnegie Recital Hall.https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/dawson892/printable/ Over the years, Kennedy toured the world as a concert pianist and as director of the Fisk Jubilee Singers. He was appointed acting chairman of the Fisk University Music Department in 1975. He retired from Fisk University in 1986. Kennedy had served on resource panels for the Tennessee Arts Commission, and on boards of the Nashville Symphony Association and the John W. Work, III Memorial Foundation. He received the Achievement Award from the National Black Music Caucus of the Music Educators‚Äô National Conference, distinguished service awards from the National Association of Negro Musicians, the Fisk University Alumni Association, and Omega Psi Phi fraternity. Kennedy held lifetime memberships with the NAACP and the Fisk University General Alumni Association. He was a member of the Nashville Fine Arts Club where he served as President. He was also a member of the Nashville Symphony Guild, Gamma Phi chapter of Omega Psi Phi, First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill, and an inductee into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in Macon, Georgia. At Fisk he was inducted into Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia music fraternity. In 2003, Kennedy released his first album, Familiar Favorites. In 2006, he received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters degree from Fisk University. In September 2006, The Honorable Jim Cooper, representative of Tennessee, entered a statement honoring Dr. Matthew Kennedy into the Congressional Record, which took place during the Proceedings and Debates of the 109th Congress, Second Session in Washington, DC. Kennedy continued to play the piano for the congregation at First Baptist Church, Capitol Hill in Nashville after he was into his 90s. He died on June 5, 2014 at the age of 93. Appearances in film In 2007, Kennedy‚Äôs daughter Nina Kennedy, also a concert pianist, directed and produced a documentary film, Matthew Kennedy: One Man's Journey,https://www.nashvillescene.com/news/article/13014396/cinematic- potpourri which won the award for Best Film by a Black Filmmaker at the 2007 Nashville Film Festival (NaFF).

It is the most distant individual star to have been detected so far (as of April 2018), at approximately 14 billion light-years from Earth (redshift z=1.49; comoving distance of 14.4 billion light-years; lookback time of 9.34 billion years). Light from the star was emitted 4.4 billion years after the Big Bang. According to co-discoverer Patrick Kelly, the star is at least a hundred times more distant than the next-farthest non-supernova star observed, SDSS J1229+1122, and is the first magnified individual star seen. History Comparison of observed data of the star Icarus with a model of a blue supergiant star spectrum In April and May 2016, the blue supergiant star was found in the course of studying the supernova SN Refsdal with the Hubble Space Telescope. Astronomer Patrick Kelly of the University of Minnesota is the lead author of the finding, published in the journal Nature Astronomy. While astronomers had been collecting images of this supernova from 2004 onward, they recently discovered a point source that had appeared in their 2013 images, and become much brighter by 2016. They determined that the point source was a solitary star being magnified more than 2,000 times by gravitational lensing. The light from LS1 was magnified not only by the huge total mass of the galaxy cluster MACS J1149+2223‚Äîlocated 5 billion light-years away‚Äîbut also transiently by another compact object of about three solar masses within the galaxy cluster itself that passed through the line of sight, an effect known as gravitational microlensing. The galaxy cluster magnification is probably by a factor of ‚âà600, while the microlensing event, which peaked in May 2016, brightened the image by an additional factor of ‚âà4. There was a second peak near the brightness curve maximum, which may indicate the star was binary. The microlensing body may have been a star or a black hole in the cluster. Continuous monitoring of the star Icarus may one day rule out the possibility that primordial black holes constitute a sizable fraction of dark matter. Normally, the only astronomical objects that can be detected at this range would be either whole galaxies, quasars, or supernovas, but the light from the star was magnified by the lensing effect. They determined the light was from a stable star, and not a supernova as its temperature did not fluctuate; the temperature also allowed them to catalog the star as a blue supergiant. The light observed from the star was emitted when the universe was about 30% of its current age of 13.8 billion years. Kelly suggested that similar microlensing discoveries could help them identify the earliest stars in the universe.  Name  The formal name MACS J1149 is a reference to MAssive Cluster Survey and the star's coordinates in the J2000 astronomical epoch. While Kelly had wanted to name the star Warhol, alluding to Andy Warhol's notion of having 15 minutes of fame, the team ended up naming the star Icarus based on the Greek mythological figure.  Astrophysical implications  The discovery shows that astronomers can study the oldest stars in background galaxies of the early universe by combining the strong gravitational lensing effect from galaxy clusters with gravitational microlensing events caused by compact objects in these galaxy clusters. By using these events, astronomers can study and test some models about dark matter in galaxy clusters and observe high energy events (supernovae, variable stars) in young galaxies.

Early life  Anne Lucille Gamble was born in Charleston, West Virginia to Dr. Henry Floyd Gamble and the former Nina Hortense Clinton. She was the younger of two children born to that union. She had two older step-siblings, Katherine Lee Gamble and Henry Floyd Gamble, Jr. Anne was eleven years old when her father was killed in a car accident in 1932. Dr. Gamble's mother had been a slave on the Howard's Neck Plantation in Goochland County, Virginia. His father, Henry Harmon Gamble, was a foreman on the same plantation, and of Scotch-Irish and Native-American descent. Anne's mother was a high school music teacher and a member of Frederick J. Loudin's Jubilee Singers, and witnessed and photographed the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902 while on tour with the group in London. Kennedy and famed contralto Marian Anderson were dear friends and colleagues. The two met when Anderson stayed in Dr. Gamble's home while in Charleston because, as an African American, she was not allowed to stay in hotels. She received her early education in Charleston public schools, which were segregated at the time. She later studied in the Junior Department at West Virginia State College under David Carroll and Theodore Phillips. Matriculating at Fisk University in 1937 where she studied with William Duncan Allen and graduated cum laude in 1941 with a Bachelor of Arts degree, and joined the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority. She then won competitive scholarships at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music while studying with the Conservatory Director, Dr. Frank Shaw, and later with John Elvin, receiving a Bachelor of Music degree.

History Moses Melchior The company was founded by Moses Marcus Melchior (1736-1817) in 1760. The company was originally based at Amagertorv 11. The company initially specialized in import of tobacco from the Netherlands but began to trade on the Danish West Indies from circa 1790. Melchior's son Gerson Melchior (1771-1845) continued the company together with his two eldest sons after his father's death in 1817. The company acquired its first ships in circa 1820. They sailed on the Danish West Indies, both with freight and passengers. A third brother, Moritz Melchior (1816-1884). joined the company in 1840. One of his elder brothers had died in 1834 and the other one died in 1843; he therefore continued the company alone when his father died in 1845 but his younger brothers Moses Melchior (1825-1912) and Israel Melchior (1827-1893) joined the company in 1848 and 1853.

Jordan III, is an American botanist and journalist who has played a leading role in the development and critique of ecological restoration as a means of developing an environmentalism that is philosophically more coherent, psychologically more productive, politically more robust, and ecologically more effective. His critique has had a significant influence on environmentalism in the United States and abroad. Jordan worked for 24 years at the University of Wisconsin's Arboretum in Madison. This was the site of early attempts to recreate historic ecological communities, such as tallgrass prairies and maple forests, an effort led by the famed conservationist Aldo Leopold. In 1981 Jordan founded and served as editor of the journal Restoration & Management Notes (now Ecological Restoration), and he was a founding member of the Society of Ecological Restoration. He has been called the first person to write consistently about the interplay between humans and nature within the context of ecological restoration, the most influential writer on restoration, and a world leader in the field. Early life and education Jordan was born in Denver. His mother was an English teacher and his father a forester who advised clients on land-management projects, including various forms of environmental rehabilitation. He earned a B.S. in biology from Marquette University in 1966, a PhD in botany from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1971, and an MA in journalism in 1975, also from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He lives in Madison, Wisconsin.  Career  In 1981, working at the University of Wisconsin arboretum, Jordan founded and edited the journal Restoration & Management Notes (now Ecological Restoration), recognized as the first journal to deal exclusively with the subject of restoration ecology. In 1984 he organized a symposium to undertake the first systematic exploration of the value of restoration as a technique for basic ecological research. He was senior editor of the resulting book, Restoration Ecology: A Synthetic Approach to Ecological Research. He was a founding member of the Society of Ecological Restoration (1989) and served as SER‚Äôs supervisor of administration for its first five years (1989-1993). Since 2001 Jordan has been director of the New Academy for Nature and Culture and editor of its online journal Environmental Prospect.\\"Contributor: William R. Jordan III\\", Center for Humans and Nature, 2018 Philosophy Jordan‚Äôs critique of environmental thinking stems from his reflections on the pioneering ecological restoration project initiated by Aldo Leopold and a handful of colleagues at the UW-Madison Arboretum in the mid-1930s, and on Leopold‚Äôs reflections on land management in \\"The Land Ethic,\\" the concluding essay in his book A Sand County Almanac. Jordan saw this project, with its commitment to restoration of historic ecosytems, as an early contribution to the development of a form of land management that offers a way for people to achieve what Leopold had called \\"membership in the land community.\\" However, drawing on the work of literary critic and poet Frederick Turner, Jordan developed a critical perspective on Leopold's idea of community, which Jordan feels is limited by its exclusion of negative emotions, specifically shame. Jordan defines shame, which he distinguishes from guilt, as the emotional response to the self‚Äôs awareness of its dependence on others, including animals and plants‚Äîin having, for example, to kill and eat them to survive. This shame, he argues, is ‚Äúnot the response of conscience to what we do, but of consciousness of what we are.\\" Our shameful feelings, as Jordan understands them, are not a condemnation of human existence but rather the raw material for the creation of the values that make human life worthwhile. Frederick Turner argues that ritual and the fine arts (which Jordan terms the ‚Äútechnologies of the imagination‚Äù) provide the tools humans need to deal productively with this aspect of experience. In Jordan's recasting, ritual and the arts offer a way to foster values such as community and beauty that Leopold made the foundation of his land ethic. Jordan argues that they have played this role throughout human history, sometimes citing anthropologist E.N. Anderson, who wrote that \\"All traditional societies that have succeeded in managing resources well over time, have done it in part through religious or ritual representation of resource management.\\" Jordan argues that the lack of such shared rituals, typical of modern societies, is the crucial factor limiting progress toward realization of a sound ethic of relationship between humans and the rest of nature. Considering ecological restoration from this perspective, Jordan proposes its development as a modern version of the \\"world renewal\\" rituals characteristic of many traditional societies. Acknowledging the difficulty, uncertainty, and ultimately even the impossibility of restoration, he sees these qualities as essential to the value of restoration as an encounter with human limitations, and so with shame and the experience of transcendent values. Examples of restoration, not yet fully ritualized, but clearly being developed as spectacle or performing art include: the conversion of tree girdling to a work of art by Wisconsin artist Barbara Westfall; nighttime prairie burns to which the public are invited in northern Illinois; and classes in reflective restoration offered at Eckerd College in Florida.

It is found in South Africa. Its type host is the Namaqua rock rat. M. Lee Goff circumscribed Afropolonia and described A. tgifi in 1983. Diagnosis and description In keys to Apoloniinae species written by Goff in 1983, by Goff and colleagues in 1989, and by Wayne A. Brown in 2006, Afropolonia tgifi was paired with Apolonia tigipioensis, the sole species of its genus. All three of these keys noted Afropolonia could be distinguished from Apolonia in having five branched setae on the palpal tarsus and in lacking subterminala I. Russian acarologist Alexandr A. Stekolnikov's 2018 key to African Trombiculidae paired Afropolonia with a pair including Straelensia and Vargatula. His key distinguished Afropolonia from those two genera in having both an anterior and a posterior pair of sternal setae, in having branched galealae, and having a coxal setation formula of 1-1-1. The idiosoma, or body, of the A. tgifi larva measures . Its anterior eyes are 11 Œºm in diameter while its posterior eyes have a diameter of 6 Œºm. Phylogeny Afropolonia is in the subfamily Apoloniinae. Goff placed Afropolonia in the tribe Apoloniini due to the sensillae having an \\"unexpanded\\" shape. Goff also included the genera Apolonia, Straelensia, Vargatula, and Womersia in Apoloniini, following P. H. Vercammen-Grandjean and M. Kolebinova's 1968 circumscription of the tribe. A fifth genus, Liuella was later added to this tribe. Distribution Afropolonia is found in South Africa. The type locality for A. tgifi is Studers Pass. Biology Namaqua rock rat (Aethomys namaquensis) The type host is the Namaqua rock rat. , this is the only known host. Taxonomic history The American entomologist M. Lee Goff circumscribed the genus Afropolonia in 1983. Goff designated A. tgifi, which he described in the same work, as the genus's type species. This was the sole species included in the genus. Goff's description was based on two specimens collected in 1980. The holotype was deposited in the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences; the paratype was deposited in the National Museum of Natural History. The specific epithet of the type species comes from the acronym TGIF (\\"Thank God It's Friday\\"). Goff had initially planned to describe this species in the Journal of Medical Entomology, although they rejected his paper because of this name; at the time, the ICZN Code discouraged \\"comical\\" names. Goff has surmised that the Bulletin of the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences subsequently accepted his paper because the European editors were unfamiliar with this term.

His work has been compared to that of Sheila Hicks, Anni Albers, and Clyfford Still.  Life and work  Wadden completed his B.F.A. at Nova Scotia College of Art and Design in 2003, where he studied under the late conceptualist painter Gerald Ferguson. Known for making abstract geometric weavings with unpredictable graphic lines that reject any predetermined systems, he hopes that they \\"create some amount of confusion in the viewer which would lead to a fascination with the process.\\" Originally focusing his practice on colorful, tessellated paintings and drawings, in 2010, Wadden began working on a weaving loom. Influenced by the quilts of Gee's Bend, the artist has explained that he avoids thinking \\"about the boundaries and limitations of what art is or isn't,\\" and often sources his materials, pre-used or second-hand, from Craigslist, eBay, and Kijiji. Imperfect angles, intentionally mismatched panels, varying fibers, and pilled fabric all point to the hand rather than machine labor in the works‚Äîhe expands on this, commenting: \\"My work is about patterning, and rhythm, and always making a mistake at some point throughout it.\\" This DIY aesthetic is also reflected in the fact that Wadden has never had formal training with textiles or on the loom. His woven paintings also draw on the histories of Abstract Expressionism, Minimalism, First Nation and Bauhaus textiles, folk art, and indigenous traditions of art-making (particularly those of his native Nova Scotia), as well as reference current political issues, such as his Keystone XL rag rug. The artist's first solo museum exhibition took place in 2018 at Contemporary Art Gallery, Vancouver.

It was founded by Armen Gulinyan ‚Äî in the past he was a co-founder of ‚ÄúPirogov's Bureau‚Äù and an employee of the media holding ‚ÄúYellow, Black and White‚Äù, which became the first investor of the new company. In July‚ÄìAugust 2013, the company established a partnership with the reseller of ‚ÄúGazprom-Media Digital‚Äù and launched a closed beta testing of the platform. Attempts to attract additional investment from companies of advertising market weren't unsuccessful, so the company was growing from main activities revenues. In late 2013 the company was invested by the Russian localizer and publisher of online games Innova, and its founder Georgy Chumburidze invited another investor, Ivan Tavrin, to the ‚ÄúPladform‚Äù. According to Gulinyan, at the beginning of 2015 the total investment in the project amounted to about 20 million rubles, and none of the company's co-owners held a controlling ownership interest, so the company's management remained in the hands of the CEO. In 2015 ‚ÄúYellow, Black and White‚Äù withdrew their capital from ‚ÄúPladform‚Äù. In 2016 it became known about the merger of ‚ÄúPladform‚Äù and the managing company of Russian video hosting Rutube, owned by ‚ÄúGazprom-Media Holding‚Äù. In the merged company ‚ÄúRuform‚Äù the holding got 33.3%, and 66.6% were divided between the owners of ‚ÄúPladform‚Äù. Gulinyan was appointed the general director of the merged company. As a result of the merger, ‚ÄúGazprom-Media Holding‚Äù got access to the content distribution network, and ‚ÄúPladform‚Äù ‚Äî to the licensed content of the channels included in the structure of ‚ÄúGazprom-Media‚Äù. B2B solutions for rights holders and promotional tools continued to operate under the ‚ÄúPladform‚Äù brand, and B2C platform kept the name Rutube. After the merger, Rutube increased its share of views in Runet from 15% to 40% and made it to the top of the app rankings in Google Play and AppStore.  Model of work  Pladform acts as an intermediary between rights holders, advertisers and websites, providing storage of video on their own servers and broadcasting via their own media player with video advertising support. Right holders can upload their own content onto websites, which are connected to ‚ÄúPladform‚Äù, and search for any content which was previously uploaded violating the copyright. From legal point of view such videos are being ‚Äúcleared‚Äù. ‚ÄúPladform‚Äù profits from promotional materials included in the video: 75% of the revenue from the advertising goes to the content owner, 25% is shared between the platform and the website that embeds the media player. In 2015 ‚ÄúPladform‚Äù had 5.95 billion views. By the beginning of 2016, ‚ÄúPladform‚Äù worked with 130 Russian and foreign copyright holders, including ‚ÄúYellow, Black and White‚Äù, ‚ÄúAlexander Maslyakov and Company‚Äù (AMiK), ‚ÄúRed Media‚Äù, ‚ÄúGazgolder‚Äù, ‚ÄúKrasny Kvadrat‚Äù and CTV.

Early years Moissi was born in Trieste to Moisi Moisiu from Kavalye, Ottoman Empire (today Kavaj√´ in Albania), who was a rich Albanian merchant of oil and wheat, and an Arb√´resh mother, Amalia de Rada, from Trieste, daughter of a Florentine doctor. After an international childhood in Trieste, Durr√´s and Graz, the 20-year-old Alexander settled with his mother and two sisters in Vienna. He began vocal studies and applied for a drama training at the k.k. Hofburgtheater, but was rejected due to his strong Italian accent and had to confine himself to non-speaking roles. It was his performance in Moli√®re's Tartuffe of the Burgtheater 1899/1900 season, which stunned the renowned Austrian actor Josef Kainz, playing the lead role. With Kainz' encouragement and support, Moissi's career as one of the great European stage actors of the early-20th century began. The following year took him to the New German Theatre in Prague and in 1903 he joined the ensemble of the Deutsches Theater in Berlin, where he became a prot√©g√© of the influential director Max Reinhardt. Together with Rudolph Schildkraut he performed in Reinhardt's staging of Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, now emphasizing his melodious speech, which despite first damning reviews finally made him a star. Moissi and the Reinhardt ensemble toured the Russia in 1911 and was acclaimed in Saint Petersburg by critic and dramatist Anatoly Lunacharsky for his interpretation of Sophocles' Oedipus. Traveling across Europe and the Americas, his most famous role was Fedya in Tolstoy's The Living Corpse -- performed more than 1400 times by him. In 1914, Moisiu acquired German citizenship to become a volunteer in World War I, and during the German Revolution of 1918‚Äì19 joined the Marxist Spartacus League. Turandot, Deutsches Theater, Berlin, December 1911 In 1920 he played the leading part in the first performance of Hugo von Hofmannsthal's Jedermann adaption of The Somonyng of Everyman at the Salzburg Festival. However, Moissi did not keep up with the German Expressionist and epic theatre movement initiated by directors like Erwin Piscator and Bertolt Brecht. He finally left Germany after the Nazi Machtergreifung in 1933 and was offered Albanian citizenship by King Zog. Alexander Moissi died of pneumonia on 22 or 23 March 1935, most likely in Vienna (other sources claim 23 March 1935 in Lugano). He was cremated at Feuerhalle Simmering and his ashes are buried at the Morcote cemetery overlooking Lake Lugano in Switzerland. Work In Berlin, Moissi was acclaimed for his 1906 performance of Oswald in Ibsen's Ghosts and in the premiere of Wedekind's Spring Awakening. His interpretations in the leading roles of Hamlet, ≈ídipus, Faust, and many others, were celebrated at the time, as were his voice and emotional range. Beside the Deutsches Theater, he performed at the Vienna Volkstheater and the Theater in der Josefstadt. Though primarily a stage actor, he appeared in ten film productions from 1910 to 1935, of which seven were silent, most notably in The Student of Prague (1913). Although a Christian, Moissi was often labeled as Jewish or of at least partial Jewish descent due to his name (which translates to \\"Moses\\") and his friendly relationship with fellow Jewish actors at a time when anti- semitism was on the rise.The Jacobean: \\"Alexander Moissi, Non-Jewish Actor, Indicts Christian World for its Persecution of the Jew\\", ufdc.ufl.edu, 4 December 1931 (page 5); \\"As a Christian, states Moissi, he cannot stand by and see the virus of anti-semitism infect Christian people, nations, and states, robbing them of all semblance of humanity and justice.\\"Lisa Silverman.

Moissi strongly rebuked his critics in the German press challenging the Christian world to live up to its ideals and desist from persecuting the Jews noting that: \\"Where Jews are concerned Christian morality, humaneness, and values are trampled underfoot\\" and \\"The road of anti-semitism is a throwback to the dark days of the Middle Ages.\\" Legacy Moissi's grave, Morcote cemetery Streets are named after Alexander Moissi in Berlin, Salzburg and Vienna, where also a monument was unveiled in 2005. In Albania he is highly venerated as a most important national actor. In his honour, the drama school of the Academy of Music and Arts in Tirana as well as the university and the city theatre of Durr√´s were named \\"Aleksand√´r Moisiu\\".Aleksand√´r Moisiu University, Durr√´s , uamd.edu.al; accessed 21 June 2015. In his father's hometown of Kavaj√´, the main public high-school and the local theater are also named after him. The 60th anniversary of his death was remembered in Albania in 1995 with an \\"Artistic Year\\" dedicated to him; it was sponsored by the Aleksand√´r Moisiu Foundation. Personal life Moissi was married twice: *His first marriage was to Maria Moissi (n√©e Marie Urfus) who was from Vienna. She founded the drama school Schauspielschule Maria Moissi Berlin where her husband also taught.German wikipedia Entry on Alexander Moissi They had one daughter, Beate Moissi, (born 1908) Alexander Moissi had another daughter with Herta Hambach, Bettina Moissi (born 1923).

They consist of upright stones that are assembled together either in geometric patterns or seemingly random configurations. Stone settings are the most common stone monuments to be found on Exmoor. As of 2001, there were 57 that had been conclusively identified. It is likely that the original number had been much higher, with many stones having been removed for use in walling, drainage, and gate posts or to allow a field to be used more easily for cultivation. Some of the solitary standing stones found on Exmoor may once have been part of these stone settings. The archaeologist Aubrey Burl noted that they were \\"almost without parallel in Britain and Ireland\\". Ten of the known stone settings are rectangular in shape. Four are quincunxes, containing five stones each. The majority of the stone settings are not of a recognisable shape, either because they were originally designed in this manner or because they have been altered over time through the removal of different stones.

His work has been featured in numerous publications, including SF Weekly, the Wisconsin Gazette and Missionlocal.org. In 2008, Novy was the recipient of the prestigious National Endowment for the Arts grant.  Early History  Novy earned an associate degree in graphic design from Gateway Technical College in Elkhorn, Wisconsin in 2004. In 2008, he earned his Bachelor of Fine Arts in photography from University of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, Wisconsin then relocated to San Francisco that same year.  Street Art  Novy first became attracted to putting stencils and wheatpastes on the streets to make his art accessible to every viewer, not just the wealthy, well educated patron of expensive galleries. In addition to democratizing art, Novy's mission is to create work that beautifies the city but also work that explores social and political themes. = Koi Fish = In 2006, Novy spent time traveling through China studying ancient and contemporary art. From his background in graphic design, Novy understood how effective subliminal branding could be and seeing those subliminal messages in political posters throughout China sparked his activism. These posters supported a communist agenda that told people how to think, giving Novy the idea to create street art to encourage viewers to think differently. At the same time he found these communist posters, Novy also learned more about Chinese scrolls, specifically the hidden messages and iconography within the image of the koi fish. The koi symbolize several lessons and trials people often encounter in life and, as koi are able to swim against the current and travel upstream, represent resilience. Furthermore, the number of koi communicates a unique message that corresponds to the meaning of that lucky number in Chinese lore. Novy was inspired by the image and symbolism behind the fish and began stenciling images of it on sidewalks in 2006. = Queer Art = Novy is one of the few street artists in the United States who openly identifies as being gay. Through his stencils, specifically ones of drag queens, queer CareBears and shirtless men, he is able to make important political and social commentary regarding LGBT rights. Novy generates gay imagery in response to what he says is a predominately male and heterosexual street art community and to promote awareness and acceptance of art regardless of the sexual orientation of its creator. Novy combats this homophobic lack of representation by celebrating gay iconography, ultimately encouraging tolerance and investment in community and urban spaces.  National Endowment for the Arts  In 2008, Novy received a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. With the funds, he curated an exhibition, ‚ÄúA History of Queer Street Art,‚Äù which premiered in San Francisco and later toured to Pop Up Gallery in Los Angeles and Yale University.

Considered the most influential printmaker to be based in New Orleans in the twentieth century, Steg made an substantial impact on printmaking in New Orleans through his own work and over his 43-year tenure as a professor of printmaking at Newcomb College. Over the course of a long artistic career that saw him engage with several 20th century art movements, Steg used nearly every known printmaking technique and invented some of his own.  Early life  Born in Alexandria, Virginia but raised on a farm in Upstate New York, James Louis Steg lived a quiet childhood between the two World Wars. He showed both a keen interest and a natural talent in drawing from an early age, and dreamed of becoming a cartoonist. While still in high school, he traveled to Chicago to attend a workshop at the Art Institute, where he would receive his first formal artistic training and sketch his first live figure at age 16.  WWII Ghost Army  A patch with Ghost Army insignia An inflatable tank used by the Ghost Army, WWII When WWII broke out, Steg enlisted in the United States Army, where his artistic training was put to use in a tactical unit known as the Ghost Army. The Ghost Army was made up of 1000 soldiers with artistic backgrounds, including such future titans as Abstract Expressionist Ellsworth Kelly and fashion designer Bill Blass, who were tasked with using their skills to deceive the enemy. Steg and the other members of the 23rd Headquarters Special Troops created and deployed fake inflatable tanks to fool the Germans into thinking Allied troops were nearby, impersonated radio operators to send false intel over the airwaves, and committed several other forms of creative espionage. Jim Steg's experience as a member of the Ghost Army would make an enormous impact on both his life and his art. The Ghost Army unit proved to be a fruitful creative environment. Steg, along with his comrades Bill Blass and Jack Masey, organized temporary exhibitions of their wartime art; one was staged in the attic of a deserted church. During this time, Steg created his first mature body of work, a series of graphite and watercolor portraits of civilians, soldiers, and refugees that he called \\"spontaneous impressions.\\" These works are given a haunting quality with context, as many of the Russian refugee subjects portrayed (who often signed their own names next to Steg's) would not survive their return to Russia.  Early work and career: 1945‚Äì1960  After the war, Steg arrived in New York City, where he was given his first solo show at the Weyhe Gallery exhibiting the portraits he had made in combat. In a contemporary interview about the exhibition, Steg described his subjects as \\"the people of Europe ... The little men of the streets ... The people who suffered the most during the war.\\" At Weyhe Gallery, which was and still is focused on American fine art prints, Steg's interest in printmaking was piqued. Soon after his exhibition, he enrolled in the University of Iowa's newly established MFA program in printmaking. There, under the tutelage of noted Argentine-American printmaker Mauricio Lasansky, Steg began to incorporate more abstract and cubist influences into his work, which had previously been exclusively figurative. Steg's early prints of the late 1940s were mainly engravings, and etchings. He then began to experiment with woodblock printing and etching in the early 1950s. In 1951, Steg accepted a position as professor of printmaking at Newcomb College at Tulane University, a position he would hold until his retirement in 1992. He continued to push the boundaries of his art during his tenure at Newcomb College, experimenting with the serigraph process, collagraphy, lithography, and toner drawings, among others. Innovations and accolades: 1960‚Äì1975 Beginning in the early 1960s, Steg was represented by the famed New York City gallery Associated American Artists, resulting in Steg's first New York Times feature in 1963. Steg's printmaking reached its apex in the mid-1960s, \\"when he introduced photographic images into his intaglio plates.\\" This innovation to combine photoresist etchings with the intaglio process put Steg on the forefront of American printmaking, alongside contemporaries like Robert Rauschenberg and Andy Warhol. Steg was \\"one of the first artists to begin using photoresist etching in a collage-like fashion and to combine it with other printmaking processes.\\" Steg's work in this new process was shown alongside the work of 18 other artists in the 1968 exhibition \\"Photography in Printmaking\\" at Associated American Artists, and was compared favorably to Warhol's silkscreen paintings of Jacqueline Kennedy in a contemporary New York Times review. In the early 1970s, Steg began to explore the human figure in a new way by \\"[using] his own body as an implement, often rolling his face across a prepared plate to create a flattened, stretched representation whose ultimate appearance was dictated somewhat by chance.\\" This new technique blended the abstract with the figurative, producing striking prints such as those from his Seven Attributes series of 1972. These prints succeeded in developing \\"his own visual language\\" and \\"establishing [Steg] as a unique voice in the field.\\" Late-career successes: 1975‚Äì1995 While Steg's work received favorable coverage in New York City and abroad, he was primarily recognized as a teacher, rather than as a fine artist, in his adopted home of New Orleans. Residing in New Orleans rather than New York City, the center of the contemporary art world, prevented Steg from doing the necessary self-promotion required to reach a large audience; Steg remarked cynically on this fact in a 1967 interview with the Tulane newspaper: \\"an artist can become rich through high pressure promotion. This doesn't make for good art, but for successful artists.\\" In a 1974 interview, Steg decried both the conservative New Orleans art market and Newcomb College's long history of decorative art, rather than fine art, as reasons his national and international reputation flourished while his local renown lagged behind. The author, longtime New Orleans art critic Joslyn Fosberg, conferred: \\"Jim Steg makes prints. They are known the world over ... But he is hardly known here.\\" This trend was corrected in 1978 with Thirty Years of J.L. Steg: 1948‚Äì1978, Steg's first solo retrospective at the New Orleans Museum of Art, which secured Steg's place in the pantheon of twentieth century New Orleans artists, alongside painters George Dunbar and Ida Kohlmeyer and photographer Clarence John Laughlin. Death and posthumous exhibitions Jim Steg died in 2001 at the age of 79. His obituary was written by Daniel Piersol, then Curator of Prints and Drawings at the New Orleans Museum of Art, who remembered him as \\"one of America's most distinguished printmakers.\\" In the years since his death, Steg's archive has been meticulously maintained by his widow, Frances Swigart Steg. The Jim Steg Collection, managed by Swigart Steg, numbers over 1,000 works and includes \\"collagraphs, charcoal drawings, serigraphs, woodcut prints, sculptures, ink toner drawings, photoresist etchings, aquatints, color etchings, and paintings\\" In 2017, the New Orleans Museum of Art debuted Jim Steg: New Work, the first solo museum retrospective of Steg's work since his previous NOMA show in 1978. Staged in the museum's Templeman Galleries and numbering over 40 works spanning the length of the artist's career, Jim Steg: New Work highlighted Steg's contribution to twentieth century printmaking both in New Orleans and beyond.

She was a charter member of the Music Supervisors' National Conference. Alexander is credited with laying the foundations of music education in the Dallas public schools.  Biography  Alexander was born on March 24, 1870 in Lincoln County, Tennessee. Later, she and her family moved to Texas and she attended school in Forney, Texas and also at Mary Nash College. She returned to Tennessee to study piano and voice at Ward Seminary, graduating in 1891. When she graduated, she and her family moved to Dallas. Alexander became the Dallas Public School's music supervisor and worked there for twelve years during which she established a \\"first rate system of music education.\\" She organized special concerts for students with conductor Walter Fried. Alexander was a charter member of the Music Supervisors' National Conference, founded in 1907. When officials cut back on music programs, Alexander created her own music textbook, published in 1912, called Songs We Like to Sing. Alexander was also instrumental in bringing a victrola to play music for her students. She was also invited to lecture on music education at the University of Texas. Alexander moved to El Paso for health reasons in 1913 after contracting tuberculosis. Her brother-in-law, Robert B. Homan, Sr., was a physician and ran a sanatorium in El Paso called Homan's San. Alexander stayed at the sanatorium for four years where she worked in the office and didn't feel that she would be able to go back to teaching music. Eventually, Alexander began to give piano lessons for her niece and word began to spread and soon Alexander had many students. There were times when she had more students than she could teach and in those situations, she would refer them to other teachers. Alexander was made an honorary life member of the National Music Teachers' Association of Texas in 1941. Formerly, she had served as president of the organization. In addition, she put together the music department for the Texas State Teachers Association.  Death and legacy  Alexander died in her home in El Paso on August 2, 1960.

More than 350 of his songs have been recorded. His most successful compositions are the Grammy-winning Kenny Rogers song, \\"You Decorated My Life\\" and the Grammy-nominated \\"Lookin' for Love,\\" the theme song for the 1980 John Travolta film, Urban Cowboy, recorded by Johnny Lee. Morrison was ASCAP's \\"Country Songwriter of the Year\\" in 1978, 1980, 1981 and 1982 and was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2016. He has a college degree in nuclear engineering and was a Hollywood film actor and a recording artist prior to becoming a full-time songwriter. His songs have been recorded by artists in a variety of genres, including Reba McEntire, The Carpenters, Sammy Davis Jr., Dottie West, Barbara Mandrell, Jerry Lee Lewis, the Oak Ridge Boys and Bobby Goldsboro. Morrison was awarded \\"Songwriter of the Year\\"(1980) by the Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI) and has earned more than 40 ASCAP songwriting citations. Early life Morrison was born in Biloxi, Mississippi. His father was a jukebox operator who left the house every two weeks to go to New Orleans to pick up a new stack of 45s to restock the local jukeboxes. Morrison received an athletic scholarship (track) to Mississippi State University where his squad won the SEC championship. He graduated with a degree in nuclear engineering in 1965. A self-taught guitarist, Morrison began playing in local bands at age 15 and later performed in clubs as a solo folk singer. While still in college, he came to the attention of noted producer and record executive John Hammond who signed him to record several singles for Columbia Records. One of those singles, released in 1965, was \\"The Shadow of Your Smile (Love Theme from The Sandpiper)\\"; and Morrison was the first singer to record it; however, Morrison's version was eclipsed by subsequent recordings by Tony Bennett and other established artists that made it a hit. Morrison moved to Hollywood in 1967 and worked as a contract actor for Screen Gems and released an album on Capitol Records, entitled \\"Friends of Mine\\", which included his original songs. He had a few successes, but after seven years, he gave up his quest for a motion picture career and left Los Angeles. Career In 1973 Morrison moved to Nashville with some aspiration to be a recording artist; he released an album \\"Home Again\\" (Monument/MG7618) in the pop-rock genre without much success. He got a job as staff writer for Bob Beckham at Nashville's Combine Music and was paired up to write with Johnny MacRae, whom he considered a mentor; In 1977, Morrison told the Tennessean, \\"Nashville was kind of the final stand for me... I knew I didn't want to be an engineer, and for a while I thought I wanted to become an actor. But I saw quickly that your body is a very expendable commodity, while songs that you write last forever.\\" His first hit as a songwriter was \\"The River's Too Wide\\", recorded by Olivia Newton-John and Sammy Davis Jr. Some of his other early hits were \\"Angels, Roses and Rain\\" (Dickey Lee), \\"You Lift Me Up to Heaven\\" (Reba McEntire) and \\"You're the One\\" (Oak Ridge Boys). The ABC Television Network used the latter song \\"You're the One\\" as the slogan for the network's national promotion in 1978, adapting it to say \\"We're the One!\\". To do this, ABC re-recorded the song with different lyrics after they struck an agreement with Morrison. Morrison says he always has five or ten songs in the works; if one isn't coming along, he rotates to the next one. Morrison's Grammy-winning song \\"You Decorated My Life\\" began as a poem written by Debbie Hupp, a Kentucky mother of five who began writing songs while working in a liquor distillery as a nightwatchman. Hupp and Morrison developed a writing relationship. She brought Morrison the first verse and the title, \\"You Decorated My Life\\". Morrison supplied the direction for the second verse, and wrote the chorus melody; together they finished the lyric. Morrison suggested the song to Dottie West, who declined it, but suggested it for Kenny Rogers. Rogers' recording, released in 1979, became a No. 1 hit on the Billboard Country Singles chart, and No. 2 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Morrison's song \\"Lookin' for Love\\" was one of the few huge hits that originated from unsoliticed amateur songwriters. Two Gulfport, Mississippi school teachers, Patti Ryan and Wanda Mallette, had songwriting aspirations. When they saw Morrison on television accepting an award for his song \\"You Decorated My Life\\" , they realized Mallette's older brother had gone to school with him, so they sent some of their songs to Morrison; he rejected them. After a while, they sent some more songs that showed some improvement and among them was \\"Lookin' for Love\\". Morrison revised a couple of lyric lines that didn‚Äôt work, cut the bridge in half and changed the chorus melody of the song slightly. Despite the song initially being turned down more than 20 times, Morrison gave a cassette to a friend in Hollywood who dropped it off at Paramount Pictures. It was chosen by Irving Azoff for the film Urban Cowboy and was sung on the soundtrack by Johnny Lee. It rose to No. 1 on the country charts and No. 5 on the pop charts in 1980. Other noted songs by Morrison are Gary Morris' \\"The Love She Found in Me\\", Conway Twitty's \\"Don't Call Him a Cowboy\\", and Highway 101's \\"Whiskey, If You Were a Woman\\". On the craft of songwriting, Morrison stated \\"Inspiration is fine, but very undependable. It's a very demanding life, and even when you're successful, you're not sure you want it.\\" Awards and honors Over 350 songs written or co-written by Morrison have been recorded. A partial list is found here: :Category: Songs written by Bob Morrison (songwriter). Morrison was ASCAP's \\"Country Songwriter of the Year\\" in 1978, 1980, 1981 and 1982 His songs have been recorded by artists including The Carpenters, Bobby Vinton, Highway 101, Barbara Mandrell, Jerry Lee Lewis and Bobby Goldsboro. Morrison was awarded \\"Songwriter of the Year\\"(1980) by the Nashville Songwriters Association International (NSAI) and, as of 2018, has earned 43 ASCAP songwriting citations. He was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2016. On the subject of composing songs, Morrison said the inherent constant rejection is hard to overcome. \\"The enjoyment comes in seeing the results. If you can make people feel something ‚Äî even if it's rage ‚Äî then you've done something,\\" he told a reporter. Personal life Morrison is tall, standing about 6 ft 3in. According to the Tennessean in 1977, he \\"has the appearance of a well-kept college athlete\\". He is one of Nashville's celebrity tennis players and practices often. Morrison said, \\"To me, these songs of mine are like little children going out into the world...some may be great, and others might fall flat‚Äî you just never know\\".

Currently, it is part of the MiclƒÉu»ôeni Historic Monastery complex, designated by the Romanian Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony in 2015. The historic complex is composed of the following monuments: * The Church of the Holy Princes and Annunciation (Biserica \\"Sf. Voievozi\\", \\"Buna Vestire\\") dating to 1787 and having LMI code: IS-II- m-B-04199.01 * The Sturdza Palace, dating to the 17th century, with LMI code: IS-II-M-B-04199.02 * The MiclƒÉu»ôeni Monastery Park, dating to the 18th century and having listed as LMI: IS-II-M-B-04199.03  History  =Original Manor= In 1410, Voivode Alexander the Good (Alexandru cel Bun) granted a fief to boyar and member of Sfatul Domnesc (\\"Prince's Council\\"), MiclƒÉu≈ü, an estate located near the Siret River plains. After the death of the noble, the estate became known by his namesake, MiclƒÉu≈üeni. On April 25, 1591, the nobleman's descendants sold the estate to treasurer Simon Stroici (1550-1623), who built a mansion on the property and fortified the village of MiclƒÉu≈üeni in 1598. The ruins of the first mansion could still be seen as late as the beginning of the twentieth century. In his last will and testament dated June 5, 1622, Simon Stroici bequeathed the estate and village of Miclauseni to Lupu PrƒÉjƒÉscu, stating: > Lupului PrƒÉjƒÉscului ≈üi nepoatei mele Saftei, ≈üi fiului meu, la Gligorie, cu > hele≈ütee ≈üi cu prisƒÉci ≈üi cu tot venitul, pentru cƒÉ i-am luat spre d√¢n≈üii ca > sƒÉ-mi fie ei ficiori de suflet. '' : To Lupul PrƒÉjƒÉscu and my niece, Saftei, > and my son, Gligorie, with ponds and with land and with all of the income, > because I have taken them to be my soul family. In 1697, the descendants of Lupu PrƒÉjƒÉscu, whom had no survivors, gave the estate to distant relatives, brothers Ion and Sandu Sturdza. April 19, 1699, the Sturdza brothers divided the estate with MiclƒÉu≈üeni being awarded to Ion Sturdza. Feudal peasants and gypsies worked the land, whose descendants to this day have surnames describing their feudal professions; BucƒÉtaru(Chef), Muraru(Mill worker), Pitaru (Baker), Curelaru (leather cutter), Mindirigiu (mattress maker), Bivolaru (livestock hearder), Surugiu (coachman), as described by Romanian Historian in his book \\"Castelul MiclƒÉu»ôeni √Æn cultura rom√¢nƒÉ\\"(MiclƒÉu»ôeni Castle and Romanian Culture) (Ed. \\"Cronica\\", Ia»ôi, 1996). In 1752, Lord Ioan Sturdza rebuilt the boyar mansion, building it with a semi- basement and cross-shaped ground level. Arhivele Na≈£ionale Ia≈üi, pac. 645. nr. 6, notele 4, 5. The mansion had 20 rooms, ten of them on each floor. Race horses were housed in the Manor's stable. The floor and ceilings were made of wood beam and wood planks. It is said that the housekeepers had their work cut out for them dealing with the mice and bugs that roamed the residence, with the Master of the Manor giving the following orders: > sƒÉ se puie √Æn var vreo doftorie de plo≈üni≈£ƒÉ ≈üi sƒÉ speli cu aceea ≈üi podelele > pe sus cu badanaua‚Äú, √Æn timp ce ‚Äûbortele de ≈üoareci sƒÉ se astupe toate cu > cƒÉrbuni pisa≈£i cu steclƒÉ :Upon this place you will rub medicinal powder to > kill the bugs which is to embedded in the paint, and to wash the ceilings in > said medicine. The holes where mice come and go shall be plugged with > crushed coal and grinded glass Concerned with the expansion of the estate, the son of Ion Strudza, Dimitrie, built a church in the vicinity of the palace in 1821-1823. He adorned the church with baroque-style icons and numerous valuable objects. The son of Dimitrie, Alecu Sturdza MiclƒÉu≈üanu, built a park of 42-hectares all stylized as an English Garden with ornamental tree species and numerous flower beds. Alecu, as a hobby, dealt in the collection and preservation of rare books and manuscripts, which further added to the richness of the Palace. Even future Prime Minister Mihail KogƒÉlniceanu spoke of the rare books and manuscripts collected by the estate.CƒÉlinescu, George. Istoria literaturii rom√¢ne. Compendiu, Editura Minerva, Bucharest, 1983 Although cousin to Prince Mihail Strudza (1834-1849), Alecu Strudza embraced the ideas of the Revolutionaries of 1848. He died in 1848 of cholera , under suspicion that he was poisoned by the Prince. His mark upon the estate was a high-degree of maintenance and precision on the English Gardens and Park on the estate grounds. He was buried in the manor's church, leaving the estate to the widow Catina. She passed the estate to her son, George A. Strudza in 1863, whom built the Sturdza Palace as seen today Strudza Palace at MiclƒÉu»ôeni =Construction of the Palace= In 1869, George Sturdza married Maria, the daughter of writer Ion Ghica, moving the family into the Manor. Maria, 11 years younger than George, was unsettled in her new environment and in the Manor. Eager to remake the Manor building, George Sturdza sold off several forests from the Estate and took out a loan of 100,000 Lei from the Romanian Land Credit Society (\\"Societatea de Credit Funciar Rom√¢n\\"). He placed the MiclƒÉu≈üeni Estate as collateral, agreeing to pay back the debts in gold coins. Between 1880 and 1904, George Sturdza built on the site of the old Manor the late Gothic architectural palace that exists today. He wanted the Palace complex to mimic the feudal castles of the West, also be reminiscent of the Palace of Culture in Iasi, and lastly also of the Lord Alexandru Cuza's palace in Ruginoasa. The Palace was used as a home for orphans with disabilities under Communist rule, counter to the wishes of daughter Catherine Sturdza who became a nun and donated the property to become a nunnery, which it finally became in 1990. https://www.thedailybeast.com/this-romanian-palace-survived-war-and-communism- now-nuns-are-racing-to-keep-it-from-falling-apart Retrieved August 12, 2018 See Also * Sturdza Family Notes Category:Buildings and structures in Ia»ôi County Category:Historic monuments in Ia»ôi County Category:Palaces in Romania Category:Tourist attractions in Ia»ôi County Category:History of Moldavia (1504‚Äì1711) Category:Medieval Wallachia Category:Medieval Moldavia External Links Official Sturdza Palace at Miclauseni Website ","title":"Sturdza Palace"},{"id":"57014905","text":"AliveCor is a medical device and artificial intelligence company that sells ECG hardware and software for consumer mobile devices. The company is the first to receive FDA-clearance for a medical-device accessory to the Apple Watch.  History  The company was co-founded by David Albert, a medical doctor and former chief clinical scientist of cardiology at General Electric, along with scientists Bruce Satchwell and Kim Barnett. Albert began working on ECGs for handheld computers in 1990, when the first palm top computer was released by Hewlett-Packard. He received a 1998 patent, along with Satchwell and Barnett, for wireless transmission of ECGs in handheld devices. In December 2010, Albert demonstrated a prototype of an iPhone ECG through a YouTube video. After the video received attention from the media, Albert was approached by venture capitalists and industry partners to fund the new company. Alivecor received its first $3 million in financing in 2011. An FDA- approved smart-phone case that works as an ECG was released by Alivecor in 2012. AliveCor ran two clinical trials to test the hardware and the app. The first study investigated how its single-lead ECG compared to a traditional 12-lead device. The second study looked at whether 54 participants with no medical training could determine how to work the phone case. The latter study passed FDA clearance and led to the diagnosis of two serious heart conditions. The company later released a credit-card sized device. The device required placing finger tips on its sensors for 30 seconds to get a medical-grade ECG reading. The data was sent to the cloud where it could be read by physicians. While its first ECG devices relied on doctors to analyze the readings, in 2015, the company received multiple clearances by the FDA to offer algorithmic analysis of readings to determine certain heart rhythm problems. The company hired former Google and Microsoft executive Vic Gundotra as its CEO in November 2016. Gundotra subsequently hired two senior Google engineers to run hardware and software for Alivecor. Frank Petterson, an engineering lead at YouTube, became VP of engineering. Simon Prakash, a senior director at Google‚Äôs hardware unit, became VP of products and design. By 2017, the company's software was using neural networks to \\"train\\" its products to detect heart problems. The network uses four convolutional layers, with two tied to 300,000 parameters and takes about seven minutes to train on a new user. After about a month of product use, the software builds a heart profile of the specific user, a data-driven model that can detect problems, including how the electrical system within a heart is firing. AliveCor had recorded about 20 million ECGs by November 2017. By the end of 2017, the FDA had cleared the KardiaBand ECG reader as a medical device accessory to the Apple Watch. The KardiaBand had been approved for use in Europe earlier in the year. A study by the Cleveland Clinic showed the KardiaBand could distinguish between atrial fibrillation and a normal heart rhythm with 93 percent sensitivity and 94 percent specificity; sensitivity increased to 99 percent with physician review of the reading. In 2017, the company was conducting research with Columbia University and the Mayo Clinic to determine if the KardiaBand can identify early warning signs of Long QT syndrome, a cause of sudden death, especially in young people. The device has multiple veterinary applications. Recently it has been shown to be an effective tool for collecting ECG data in goats.https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2020.00416/abstract AliveCor presented research in March 2018 that it conducted with the Mayo Clinic showing that the KardiaBand can detect hyperkalemia, elevated levels of potassium in the blood, with 90% to 94% accuracy. Existing tests for the condition require laboratory blood tests. To create the detection method, a dataset with 2 million ECGs linked to 4 million serum potassium values, collected over 23 years was analysed using artificial intelligence (AI). The company said it would pursue clinical trials and FDA-clearance for the detection method. As of 2018, Alivecor products had been tested in about 40 clinical studies published in peer-reviewed journals. Fast Company ranked Alivecor number one in artificial intelligence in its 2018 list of the \\"World's Most Innovative Companies.\\" In February 2018, founding CEO Vic Gundotra left the company and Ira Bahr was appointed as interim CEO. Priya Abani, formerly the general manager and director of Alexa at Amazon, was hired as the new CEO in July 2019. In 2019, the company ended sales of the KardiaBand ECG reader. In March 2020, AliveCor announced the appointment of Siva Somayajula as its Chief Technology Officer. Somayajula formerly served as a Director of Product Software and Services for consumer electronics at Amazon.  Products  = KardiaMobile = KardiaMobile KardiaMobile is a smartphone-connected ECG recorder for personal use. The user places his or her fingertips on a chewing gum-stick sized device for about 30 seconds and the results are sent to the user's smartphone. The results can be read by the user and also e-mailed to a physician. It was cleared by the FDA in 2012 for detecting atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm. = KardiaPro = KardiaPro is a platform for doctors to monitor their patients using Kardia devices. The platform alerts doctors when a patient's device detects an abnormality. KardiaPro also tracks patient risk factors, including weight, activity and blood pressure and analyzes them with AI to alert doctors to potential issues. = KardiaBand = KardiaBand The KardiaBand was a wrist- band ECG reader for the Apple Watch used to detect atrial fibrillation, approved by the FDA in 2017. The device's SmartRhythm software used artificial intelligence to continuously analyze data from the built-in heart-rate sensor and accelerometer to spot unexpected patterns. Unusual patterns prompted the user to take a 30-second ECG on the device by touching a wristband sensor. Sales of the KardiaBand ended in 2019, after later generations of the Apple Watch incorporated built in ECG sensors.  Financing  Total investment by the end of 2019 was $69.3 million. The company raised $30 million in funding from medical-device maker Omron and the Mayo Clinic in 2017. Previous investors include Khosla Ventures, Bold Capital Partners, and Burrill Life Sciences Capital. Kearny Partners, Qualcomm and Oklahoma Life Science are also investors.

K√§lin (born 1971) is a Swiss lawyer, author, editor, entrepreneur, humanitarian, and the chairman of Henley & Partners and is known as \\"Mr Citizenship\\" or \\"The Passport King\\". K√§lin holds master's and PhD degrees in law from the University of Zurich. His doctoral thesis was published under the title Ius Doni: The Acquisition of Citizenship by Investment. Having coined the term ius doni as a stand-in for citizenship-by- investment, K√§lin introduced the concept of ius doni into the contemporary legal and political theory of citizenship by providing the first academic analysis of the subject. He is the author, co-author, or editor of the Global Residence and Citizenship Handbook, the Henley & Partners ‚Äì Kochenov Quality of Nationality Index (an annual academic publication), Ius Doni: The Acquisition of Citizenship by Investment, the International Real Estate Handbook, and the Switzerland Business & Investment Handbook. K√§lin is the Editor-in-Chief of the Global Citizenship Review, a quarterly publication in which international authors from legal, financial, business, political, academic and philanthropic spheres provide insight into key issues affecting global citizens through analysis, commentary, and news. K√§lin is also the founder and chairman of Andan Foundation, based in Switzerland, which focuses in particular on supporting displaced people and coordinates the multi-year partnership between Henley & Partners and UNHCR. Early life K√§lin was born in 1971 in Zurich. In his teenage years, he began collecting immigration and citizenship laws from different countries, writing to embassies to request copies of their legislations and keeping the documents in a big binder. He told writer and journalist Atossa Araxia Abrahamian of this time in his life: \\"What always fascinated me was the inclusionary and exclusionary aspect of citizenship [...] I wanted to understand how different countries handled this.\\" K√§lin studied in Paris, Auckland and Zurich and earned master's and PhD degrees in law from the University of Zurich. Career K√§lin is the chairman of Henley & Partners. He is also a member of the Governing Board of the Investment Migration Council in Geneva. He has spoken at international conferences on different aspects of international residence, citizenship and real estate and is a member of the panel of judges for the International Property Awards. In 2016 at The Economist Mediterranean Leadership Summit he gave a keynote speech on how smaller states can harness the benefits of Citizenship-by-Investment programs to boost their foreign direct investments, and that this has been practiced since Roman times. K√§lin is also licensed as an independent insurance intermediary by the Swiss Federal Government and a member of the Society of Trust and Estate Practitioners (STEP), the International Tax Planning Association (ITPA), and the Investment Migration Council (IMC). He is known for pioneering the concept of \\"citizenship-by- investment\\", whereby people can acquire citizenship in return for investing in a country of which they are not a national. K√§lin is a frequent guest and expert in newspapers and TV channels including CBS 60 Minutes, which introduced him as the man who ‚Äúmore or less invented the business‚Äù, and the GQ Magazine, which described him as the man who \\"has transformed the lives of his clients and the economies of the countries he's advised\\". In 2006, K√§lin published the first edition of the Switzerland Business & Investment Handbook. K√§lin‚Äôs ‚Äúclaim to fame‚Äù is a 766-page guide to doing business in Switzerland, a tome found in many of the country‚Äôs embassies. K√§lin is also featured in a book about the investment migration industry, Cosmopolites: The Coming of the Global Citizen by former Reuters New York journalist Atossa Abrahamian, published in 2015. K√§lin created the Henley Passport Index, which was first published in 2006, and is regarded as the inventor of the passport index concept. The index displays the travel freedom each citizen in this world has. In partnership with the IATA, visa regulations are monitored and analyzed worldwide. In collaboration with Dr. Dimitry Kochenov, an EU professor of law, K√§lin authored The Quality of Nationality Index (QNI), an annual academic report published since 2015. The index ranks the quality of nationalities based on internal and external factors. The Financial Times commented that the authors ‚Äúrightly consider that it is not only the freedom to travel and settle elsewhere that makes a person‚Äôs nationality valuable. Nationality of a country also gives you the right to live there.‚Äù K√§lin and Henley & Partners have worked with the governments of Antigua and Barbuda, Austria, Australia, Cyprus, Greece, Grenada, Malta, Montenegro, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Thailand. K√§lin states that \\"citizenship is inherently unjust\\". In 2007, K√§lin worked with the Government of St Kitts and Nevis to reform their Citizenship-by-Investment program and to initiate the Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation impacting the transition of the shuttered sugar industry. This was a decisive turning point and the basis of the investment migration industry as it is shaped today as it allowed the efficient processing of a larger number of Citizenship-by-Investment applications. With the launch of this first modern Citizenship-by-Investment program and the establishment of the Sugar Industry Diversification Foundation direct contribution option, K√§lin and Henley & Partners laid out a path of continuous growth for St Kitts and Nevis and subsequently for several other Caribbean states which adopted this system. In 2010, K√§lin was introduced to SCL Group and its CEO Alexander Nix during the St. Kitts and Nevis 2010 election campaign. Both sides stated that there was never a formal working relationship between them and that the exchange of ideas and information that took place between them was a natural and normal consequence of their operating in the same region and countries since many years. Following 9/11, K√§lin stated in a widely quoted article in the Financial Times in 2015 that demand for alternative residence and citizenship has significantly accelerated: ‚ÄúA lot more people are seeing the value of an alternative citizenship.‚Äù K√§lin was the lead consultant in the creation and implementation of the Citizenship-by- Investment program of Antigua and Barbuda in 2013. In 2014, K√§lin was appointed chairman of Henley & Partners following many years in different senior roles at the firm. In May 2017, K√§lin consulted with Malta's Prime Minister, Joseph Muscat, and Minister of Justice, Owen Bonnici together with law firm Mishcon de Reya, to write to the investigative journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia, in an attempt to get her to remove defamatory blog posts. Daphne Caruana Galizia was a fierce critic of Malta's citizenship by investment program. Asked by The Economist, K√§lin responded, \\"If you operate globally, you have to have more than one passport\\", but declined to reveal how many passports he holds himself. He has written and held speeches on the benefits of residence and citizenship by investment programs as tools to attract foreign direct investments for smaller states. In 2019, K√§lin‚Äôs Andan Foundation launched the MIT SOLVE Innovation for Refugee Inclusion Prize in collaboration with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

A counter-story in the film, which collides with the main story at the climax, relates to a mission to destroy the newly constructed railway bridge by a fictitious cloak and dagger sabotage organisation called \\"Force 316\\", whose training base is in Ceylon. In fact, this is a thinly-disguised reference to the real-life Force 136, part of SOE, who indeed had wartime jungle-training facilities in Ceylon at M.E. 25‚ÄîHorona. * Carve Her Name with Pride (1958) : Based on the book by R.J.

A related population of Chinese Americans lives across the Mississippi River in the Arkansas Delta and the nearby city of Memphis, Tennessee.\\"Chinese,\\" Enclyopedia of Arkansas, 2017  History  The earliest Chinese settlers in the Mississippi Delta were laborers recruited by cotton planters to supplement the recently emancipated African freedmen during Reconstruction. Like other early Chinese Americans, the first Chinese immigrants were peasants and merchants from the Sze Yap region of Guangdong province in Southern China. All of them were single and married men who worked in Mississippi and sent most of their income back to their families in China. As they were neither black nor white, the Chinese were often classified as \\"colored\\" in early government records.Loewen, James W. 1971. The Mississippi Chinese: Between Black and White, Cambridge: Harvard University PressQuan, Robert Seto. 1982. Lotus Among the Magnolias: The Mississippi Chinese, Jackson: University Press of Mississippi By the end of the 1870s, the Chinese had abandoned the plantations and began opening small family-owned grocery stores in the many small towns of the Delta. Chinese families began moving to the Delta in the early 1900s, and most modern Mississippi Delta Chinese are the descendants of Chinese who arrived in Mississippi during this time. Until the end of the 1900s, Chinese- owned groceries could be found in every Delta city and town, serving both white and black customers. Chinese children were originally segregated from the white public schools, and segregated Chinese schools were built for them in Greenville and Cleveland. However, these schools were closed and Chinese children were allowed to attend both white schools and white colleges after the Second World War. Gong, Gwendolyn.

Chopsticks in the Land of Cotton: Lives of Mississippi Delta Chinese Grocers., Yin & Yang Press. The population of the Mississippi Delta Chinese exploded after war. Many young Chinese men from the Mississippi Delta served as soldiers during the Second World War, and many women from China married these soldiers and settled in the Delta as war brides after the war. By the 1970s there were as many as 3,000 Americans of Chinese descent living in the Delta, especially American-born Chinese children who were raised in the Delta. For decades the Mississippi Delta Chinese community was one of the largest Chinese American communities in the American South, but since then, many families have moved to larger cities in Texas, the West Coast, and the Northeast. Most of the historic Chinese groceries have already closed, and only a few families remain in the Delta.  Ethnic identity  Arriving into a strictly segregated society with whites on top and blacks on the bottom, the Chinese carved out their own unique niche in a primarily biracial society. Neither black nor white, they were initially classified as \\"non-white\\" and later as simply \\"Chinese\\". While not seen as being on the same social status as whites neither were they seen on the same level as blacks despite often living in black neighborhoods and serving mostly black clients and customers. The Chinese were middlemen between blacks and whites, often providing a needed contact point in a segregated society. The Chinese initially attended separate Chinese schools separate from both blacks and whites although in later decades before segregation officially was outlawed, they often attended schools with white students. In many cases they sought to identify with white society as much as they could due to whites having the highest status in Jim Crow society. Many Chinese men, for the lack of Chinese women to marry, married Black women.  Notable people  * Sam Chu Lin, journalist and news anchor * Martin F.

Biography  = Early years = Eulalia Kadmina was born in Kaluga in the family of a Kaluga merchant Pavel Maksimovich Kadmin and a gypsy Anna Nikolaevna.–ï–≤–ª–∞–ª–∏—è –ö–∞–¥–º–∏–Ω–∞ ‚Äì –∑–∞–±—ã—Ç–∞—è –≥–æ—Ä–¥–æ—Å—Ç—å –ö–∞–ª—É–≥–∏ In the XIX century, such unions were considered extremely unusual. Eulalia was the youngest of the three sisters. From early childhood, she began to show a violent, very proud and independent character. Eulalia grew up as a closed, lonely child, who did not meet at all with anyone, even with her own sisters. She learned to read early and spent all her free time reading books. The father singled it out against the background of other children, and at the age of 12 arranged for Eulalia in a prestigious educational institution Moscow Elizabeth Institute. The Institute was famous for its strict discipline and high level of education. In order to prevent the young pupils from distracting from training, all the windows of the establishment were thickly smeared with chalk, so there was no way to look out onto the street. Leaving the walls of the Elizabeth Institute, girls, as a rule, became governesses. Everyone noted that they were the wildest governess, since the presence of the man at the table led the girls into a terrible embarrassment. Girls were not adapted to life. Kadmina was already looking for a graduate of the workplace, as one meeting occurred, dramatically changed everything. Young pupils often gave concerts for guests. Possessing a wonderful voice, Eulalia often took part in them. In 1870 Nikolai Rubinstein visited such an amateur performance. Struck by the singing of Eulalia, he persuaded her to devote herself to music and become a singer. Nikolai Rubinshtein took an active part in the fate of the beginning singer. Despite the fact that after his father's death in the same year of 1870, Kadmina's family was left without money, he helped the girl not only become a student of the Moscow Conservatory in singing class, but also receive a scholarship.Operissimo Among the teachers of Kadmina were such honored artists as Alexandra Alexandrova-Kochetova, Ivan Samarin and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Later, charmed by her velvety rich mezzo-soprano, Tchaikovsky wrote specially for her music to the spring fairy tale of Alexander Ostrovsky The Snow Maiden. At the age of eighteen, her stage debut took place. Nikolay Rubinstein invited the budding Kadmin–∞ to the role of Orpheus in the Gluck's opera Orpheus and Eurydice. ‚Äî Eulalia, when she wanted, could be more aristocratic than all princesses. And will find a frenzy on her it will dissolve worse than a street girl, ‚Äî theatrical critic Alexander Amfiteatrov wrote about the brilliant student of the Conservatoire. Alas, she categorically did not appreciate her talent, nor the generous gift that fate gave her. As a result, he secretly leaves, actually runs to the main country of opera in Italy. = Italy = Cadmina sings in Naples, Turin, Florence and even in Milan, and everywhere she is invariably accompanied by a resounding success. But here, too, she can not be saved from herself and experiences the same loneliness that burns her from within. At some point, Kadmina understands that Italy no matter how enthusiastically she was received here is a career impasse, a trap in which she was driven by life inexperience and ambition. Twice Eulalia tries to commit suicide: she throws herself into the river, but the police drag her out unscathed, drink poison, but the strong body copes. Nervous, he gets sick, and then the young doctor Ernesto Falconi comes to the aid of the opera diva, who is able to cure not only her body but her soul, unfortunately, for a short while.100 –∑–Ω–∞–º–µ–Ω–∏—Ç—ã—Ö —Ö–∞—Ä—å–∫–æ–≤—á–∞–Ω A young Italian makes he an offer, and she accepts it. Did the girl love him? Hardly. Most likely, she just saw in a good Italian salvation from her agonizing loneliness. But the Italian period inevitably comes to its logical conclusion. Kadmin is increasingly drawn to his homeland, but she does not want to go back to where she already had a deafening triumph. And then an invitation comes from an entertainer of the Kiev Opera House, Eulalia accepts him. =Kiev= In Kiev, her success is predictably deafening: at the premiere of the opera Aida at the Kiev Opera House, the curtain is raised 15 (!) Times encore. But after the Mariinsky Theatre and Bolshoi, this is already a clear career decline, and its consequences were not slow to manifest. –ú—è—Ç–µ–∂–Ω–∞—è –¥—É—à–∞ (–ï–≤–ª–∞–ª–∏—è –ö–∞–¥–º–∏–Ω–∞) The atmosphere of the theatrical Kiev was thoroughly patchy: stuffy, shallow and mean. The theatrical public is divided into the fans of one or another opera diva, and she encounters the arrival of a new rival. Eulalia is beginning to harass in every possible way: at concerts she is booed, ordering corrupt verses from corrupt journalists. All this painfully self-respecting Kadmina experienced very hard. And then the discord began in the family life. The Italian husband was uncomfortable in someone else's Kiev for him, besides, he was very jealous of his wife. In the end, the couple part with a scandal, and Ernesto returns to his homeland. In Italy, Kadmina not only did not regret her voice, but also in every possible way tested it for strength. She sings whole parts not only in her natural mezzo-soprano, but also in a higher soprano. Dangerous experiments did not pass without a trace, and the singer with horror realizes that she begins to lose her voice. It would seem that the prima donna's career is over. But fate favors her and gives her a second chance. Kharkov Theater offers Kadmina try himself on the dramatic stage. She accepts the invitation. =Kharkov= In 1881, Kadmina passionately falls in love with an officer. A romance is breaking out. Her chosen one, who came from an impoverished noble family, soon decides to marry and looks for an advantageous party. Trying to escape from mental anguish, Kadmin–∞ plunges headlong into work. November 4, 1881 in the Kharkov Theater put a play by Alexander Ostrovsky Vasilisa Melentyeva. The actress, as always, plays passionately, passionately. The atmosphere in the hall is heated to the limit. And suddenly among the spectators Kadmina sees his former lover with the bride. Cadmina is furious, the revenge plan is immediately born in her head. During the interval Kadmina found matches in the latrine, broke off the phosphorus heads, filled them with tea and drank this mixture.–ï–≤–ª–∞–ª–∏—è –ö–∞–¥–º–∏–Ω–∞. –ñ–µ—Å—Ç–æ–∫–∏–π —Ä–æ–º–∞–Ω. = Memory = The actress's suicide on stage caused a whole wave of responses in Russian literature.

This bill was introduced to the Scottish Parliament amid failing negotiations between the Scottish Government and the Government of the United Kingdom on where key powers, which would ordinarily be devolved, should lie on the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union. The bill was referred to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom under section33 of the Scotland Act 1998 by the Attorney General for England and Wales (on behalf of the UK Government) and the Advocate General for Scotland. The case summary according to the court in UK Withdrawal from the European Union (Legal Continuity) (Scotland) Bill 2018 ‚Äì A Reference by the Attorney General and the Advocate General for Scotland ([2018] UKSC 64) stated: On 13December2018, the Supreme Court ruled that only section17 of the bill would have been outwith the legal competence of the Scottish Parliament under the Scotland Act 1998 at the time of its passage. However, due to the passage and enactment of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 by the UK Parliament while the Scottish Bill was under review, many more sections of the bill are not within its legal competence and that the bill as far as those sections are concerned is therefore 'not law'. The governments of Scotland and of the United Kingdom differed sharply on the outcome.

It premiered on April 2, 2018, and concluded on September 29, 2018. Mei Nagano was cast in the lead role of Suzume Nireno after an audition of 2366 women. Plot Suzume Nireno and Ritsu Hagio were born on the same day in 1971 in a small town in Gifu Prefecture. They grow up as close friends, with Suzume encouraging the smart but shy Ritsu, and Ritsu protecting Suzume, who lost hearing in one ear due to an illness. They are still close in high school, but their first romantic interests are directed at other people: for Ritsu, a beautiful girl in the archery club of another school; for Suzumu, a kind boy also from another school. Nothing much comes of either as they and their friends have to think of life after high school. Suzume plans to work but is only able to get a job at the local farmer's coop thanks to her grandfather's connections. Ritsu, however, has been lending her the shojo manga of Haori Akikaze, which inspire Suzume to draw her own manga. When she meets Akikaze in person‚Äîwho turns out to be a man‚Äîand shows him her work, he suddenly asks her to come work for him. She has to battle with her mother to let her go to Tokyo, but when she begins working for Akikaze, she finds out the main reason he hired her was for the rice treats her grandfather made. She convinces him to give her a test to earn her place as an apprentice. Meanwhile, Ritsu too is in Tokyo attending college and has made friends with Masato. Akikaze fires Suzume when he thinks she has thrown out an important draft of a manga, but when he discovers he just misplaced it, he travels to Gifu to bring her back and finally begin her real training as a manga artist. Around then, Ritsu re-encounters Saya, the archery girl, and the two begin dating. Suzume also begins to fall in love with Masato, but he rejects her, thinking she really belongs with Ritsu. But with Saya having grown jealous of Suzume, Ritsu decides to end all contact with Suzume. The two rejections are a double whammy for Suzume, but Akikaze encourages her to express her feelings in creating manga. She, Y≈´ko, and Makoto‚ÄîAkikaze's apprentices‚Äîcompete for a famous newcomer award, which Makoto wins, but has to withdraw after he earns Akikaze's ire for publishing another manga in a disreputable magazine. The award then goes to Suzume, who along with Y≈´ko, gets to draw her first serialized manga. After several years, Y≈´ko is the first to hit the brick wall and can't think of a new manga and ends up quitting. Suzume visits Gifu for the first time in a while and runs into Ritsu, who has broken up with Saya. He suddenly asks her to marry him, but she says it is impossible. She meant it was impossible at that time, but he took it differently. Soon afterwards Suzume's serialization also ends, but she gets additional bad news when she learns Ritsu has gotten married. Always weak in storytelling, Suzume also fails to think of a new manga and quits. It's 1999 and she is 28 years old, so with no other prospects, she ends up working at a dollar store. There she meets Ryoji, the nephew of the three women who own the store. He's a budding filmmaker, working for the often-out-of-work director named Motosumiyoshi, who soon falls in love with Suzume. They decide to get married, and when Ryoji writes a screenplay based on a popular novel, he thinks this his chance to debut as a director, but Motosumiyoshi takes the job. Ryoji gives up on becoming a director and devotes himself to Suzume and their daughter Kano. A few years later, however, he catches the filmmaking bug again and, against Suzume's protests, leaves her and his daughter to pursue his career. Suzume returns to Gifu to find out that her younger brother Shota had revived the family restaurant with a new menu. She also meets Ritsu again, who is in town looking after his sick mother Wako. Suzume decides to start a food stand selling goheimochi, learning the secret recipe from her grandfather Senkichi before he dies. She also helps Ritsu when Wako dies and even helps him mend ways with his wife, even though she still loves him. Learning of a place in Tokyo that lets you market your ideas on a small scale, and believing Kano has potential as an ice skater, Suzume decides to return to Tokyo. Things do not go well, however, as the company she works for goes under and her product ideas seem to go nowhere. But she does run into not only Masato, but also Ritsu, who has gotten divorced. Teaming up with Ritsu, who quits his job, Suzume develops the idea of creating a fan that creates what feels like a natural, not artificial breeze. Ryoji reappears and helps them by making a promotional video, but Suzume rejects his proposal to reunite. After many experiments, Suzume and Ritsu finally succeed in creating a natural fan, but on the day they present it to investors, the T≈çhoku earthquake happens. Suzume is shocked to hear that her friend Y≈´ko died in the disaster, but she is determined to keep going, this time with Ritsu as her partner in life.

He was born in Morristown, Vermont, to John Baker Cristy and Louisa Lydia Cristy, n√©e Cooke. He attended Reading High School in Reading, Massachusetts, and Monson Academy in Wilbraham. He was at Amherst College for three terms in 1869 and 1870, but did not graduate there; he gained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Dartmouth College, graduating in 1873. He was admitted to the bar in about 1874 and began practicing law in Marblehead, then opened a law office in Worcester the following year. From 1882 to September 1884 he was assistant clerk of the Central District Court in Worcester. He founded the Worcester Sunday Telegram, with the first issue appearing on November 30, 1884, followed by the Daily Telegram two years later. He focused on sensational stories, emphasizing crimes and scandals, and was also a Republican, often attacking Democrats in the pages of the newspaper. He made political enemies during his time at the Central District Court, and later said that \\"The Telegram was started to square accounts with those who had been hostile\\". He also crusaded against alcohol, though a rival paper once reported he had been brought to their offices while drunk. The paper was a success, and he remained editor and owner until he sold the paper to Theodore T. Ellis in 1920 for $1,000,000. Ellis had worked in the Telegram's pressroom, but Cristy let him go because Ellis was working on inventions to improve the printing process and Cristy asked him to either stop or resign. Ellis's inventions were successful and made enough money for him to purchase the paper from Cristy. He published a guide book for his reporters, and his sayings, such as \\"The body of a person drowned should not be called a floater. No dead body should be called a stiff.\\" became known as Cristyisms. On May 26, 1876 Cristy married Mary Elizabeth Bassett; she died in November 1913 and he remarried on January 12, 1915, to Katherine V. Horan. He had three sons, Horace, Austin, and Roger, and two daughters, Mary and Edna, all by his first marriage. He attempted to commit suicide on November 29, 1926, possibly because of financial problems, though it may have been because of concerns over his health. He shot himself near the heart with a revolver, in the office of a broker. He died of his wounds two days later.

The film stars Brendan Gleeson, Amanda Donohoe, James Nesbitt, Adrian Dunbar, Bronagh Gallagher and Ruth McCabe. The film was released on 26 October 2001 by United International Pictures. Plot Harry McKee is a successful television chef for a regional broadcaster. Although he has been in the newspapers a lot because of his alcoholic chap, he is very popular with viewers. In his private life, however, things look different for him: his wife Ruth, whom he has betrayed several times, wants to divorce him. Somewhat emotionally agitated, he exposes local politician Walter Adair in his cooking show by making fun of his sexual preferences. Harry collapses in the ensuing court case, in which the details of his divorce are to be clarified. When he wakes up after a few days in a coma, Harry suffers from amnesia. The last 25 years seem to have been erased from his memory. He is now in the same hospital as the politician Adair, who has had to seek treatment since fleeing from intrusive journalists and falling from a bridge. Although Harry's wife and children do not really want to believe him and consider amnesia to be a ploy to delay the divorce, they take him back home. Using old photo albums, they try to refresh his memory. On the advice of the doctors, however, they hide his TV cooking career from him. However, he is informed about this by his friend and lawyer. He also learns from him that his wife wants to divorce him. Although Harry's complete memory has not yet come back, his unit manager urges him to get back to the cooking shows. During the first show a viewer suddenly disrupts the process. It is Walter Adair, disguised as a woman, who draws a gun and threatens Harry. The program will then also go live on national channels. The meanwhile refined cook wants to give himself up to his fate when suddenly Ruth appears. After she succeeds in disarming Adair, she promises Harry to make up with him again. However, she insists on the divorce and challenges him to reconsider his life. Only when he was absolutely sure that he wanted a future together with her should he contact her again. Harry predicts that he will contact her the same day and ends - as if nothing had happened - his cooking show by announcing the guests of the next show.

Her verses appear in most major Sanskrit anthologies, and her poetic skills have been praised by the medieval Sanskrit literary critics.  Biography  Shilabhattarika lived in the 9th century. One of her poems mentions the Narmada River (Reva) and the Vindhya mountains. Therefore, as a young woman, she probably lived along the Narmada River, near the Vindhyas. M. B. Padma, a scholar of the University of Mysore, speculates that she may be same as Shila-mahadevi, the queen of the 8th century Rashtrakuta ruler Dhruva. Padma's theory is based on the facts that the suffix \\"Bhattarika\\" attached to the poet's name indicates her high social status, and that the queen is known to have made generous grants to scholars. The 10th century poet Rajashekhara praises Shilabhattarika as a leading figure of the Panchali literary style (one of the four major contemporary literary styles - the other three being Vaidharbhi, Gaudi, and Lati). A verse, attributed to Rajashekhara in Vallabhadeva's 15th century anthology Subhashitavali, states that this style maintains \\"a balance between words and meaning\\". According to Rajashekhara, the Panchali style can be traced to the works of Shilabhattarika, and possibly in some of the works of the 7th century poet Bana. Shilabhattarika has been quoted by several classical Sanskrit literary critics, and her verses appear in most major Sanskrit anthologies. She is known to have written at least 46 poems on topics such as \\"love, morality, politics, nature, beauty, the seasons, insects, anger, indignation, codes of conduct, and the characteristic features of various kinds of heroines.\\" However, most of her works are now lost, and only six of her short poems are extant. Sharngadhara-paddhati, a 14th century anthology, praises her and three other female poets in the following words:  Example verses  The following short poem of Shilabhattarika is considered as one of the greatest poems ever written in the Sanskrit tradition. Indian scholar Supriya Banik Pal believes that the poem expresses the speaker's anxiety to be reunited with her husband. According to American author Jeffrey Moussaieff Masson, the poetess, possibly a middle-aged woman, implies that the illicit, pre-marital love between her and her lover was richer than their love as a married couple. An interpretation by the 16-century philosopher Chaitanya suggests that the verse is a metaphor for a person's desire to be united with the \\"Supreme Lord - the Absolute\\". The following verse expresses the speaker's longing for his wife: In the following verse, a poor speaker expresses grief at not being able to provide his loved one with jewels or food: The following verse, also quoted in the Subhashita Ratna Bhandagara, describes the importance of learning and engaging in discussions with scholars:  References  = Bibliography =   * Category:Sanskrit-language women poets Category:Indian women poets Category:9th-century Indian poets ","title":"Shilabhattarika"},{"id":"57016199","title":"3 from Hell"},{"id":"57016248","text":"Journal de Chimie Physique (JCP) was a peer-reviewed scientific journal of physical chemistry.

He is a nephew of President Muhammadu Buhari; and a prominent member of the infamous Kaduna Mafia, a loose group of Nigerian businessmen, civil servants, intellectuals and military officers from Northern Nigeria.  Life  Mamman Daura was born in Daura, Northern Region, British Nigeria in 1939, his father Alhaji Dauda Daura held the traditional title of Durbin Daura of the Daura Emirate; and was Muhammadu Buhari's elder brother. He was educated at Daura Elementary School, Katsina Middle School before attending Provincial Secondary School, Okene. In 1956, at the age of 17, he started working with the Daura Native Authority for a couple of years before joining the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation. He was one of six northerners selected by Sir Ahmadu Bello to study in England. From 1962 to 1967, he read economics and politics at Trinity College, Dublin. On his return in 1967, he spent a year as an assistant in the Cabinet of Northern Nigeria, before returning to Dublin for a masters degree in business and public administration. In 1968, Adamu Ciroma, editor of the New Nigerian was looking to recruit qualified and educated northern Nigerians for the newspaper. One of those recruits was Daura who was just finishing his masters degree in Dublin. Daura was hesitant to take the position and returned to the northern civil service as a political secretary working in the office of General Abba Kyari the military governor of North-Central State. In April 1969, he finally joined the New Nigerian, replacing Adamu Ciroma as the paper's new editor. The first two years of his stewardship was a focus on coverage of issues affecting Northerners and protection of northern interests. In 1974, he later became the managing director of the paper's holding company. When General Murtala Mohammed's administration opted to take over the ownership of the paper, Daura soon left the company and retired into private business. In the late 1970s, he served on several government boards and agencies including the News Agency of Nigeria; and co-founded Funtua Textiles Limited alongside Ismaila Isa Funtua. In the 1980s he was Chairman of the Nigerian Television Authority and later Africa International Bank (a subsidiary of Bank of Credit and Commerce International), he also founded a furniture factory in Kaduna and was chairman of the defunct Nigerian Bank of Commerce and Industry.

It is not clear when or where he was born. It is believed he was born in Antwerp around 1655. A Jacobus Peeters was registered in the guild year 1672-72 as an apprentice with the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a pupil of the painter Peter van de Velde. A Jacobus Peeters is also mentioned as a pupil in the guild year 1675‚Äì76.Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde, Volume 2, Antwerp, 1864, pp. 423, 534, 563, 607, on Google books It is not clear whether Jacob Balthasar Peeters can be identified with either or both of these pupils.Olaf Koester, Flemish paintings, 1600‚Äì1800, Statens museum for kunst, 2000, p. 179 Elegant figures in oriental costume by a palace In the guild year 1688‚Äì1689 Peeters became a master in the Guild. Elected in 1695 to serve as dean of the Guild, he preferred to pay the fixed contribution of 360 guilders to be exempted from this charge.Uitgaven der Maatschappij der Antwerpsche bibliophilen, J.-E. Buschmann, 1907, pp. 523‚Äì524 His pupils included Jan- Baptist van Isschot, Jan Baptist van der Straeten, Jan Carel Vierpeyl, Rombaut Bacx and Nicolaas Gillis. The date and place of his death are not known. The artist is usually described as being active from circa 1673 to circa 1721 in Antwerp. A pair of paintings depicting the interiors of the Jesuit Church in Antwerp and signed and dated 1721 are evidence that the artist was still alive in that year.Jacobus Balthasar Peeters, Two Interiors of the Jesuit Church in Antwerp at Lempertz Work Jacob Balthasar Peeters was a specialist painter of imaginary Renaissance and Baroque palaces and paintings of existing churches. Peeters would place among these imaginary or existing structures and outdoor settings elegant figures, usually wearing exotic hats and costumes, together with their, often black, pages and with dogs running around. As was common practice in Antwerp artistic practice of that period, Peeters collaborated with other artists. A pair of paintings depicting Fantastic courtly architecture with staffage (Hampel Munich auction of 25 September 2014, lot 679) constitute a collaborative effort of Peeters and Hendrik van Minderhout. Jacob Peeters and Hendrik van Minderhout, Gem√§ldepaar Fantastische h√∂fische Architektur mit Figurenstaffage at Hampel Auctions Van Minderhout was a Dutch painter active in Antwerp who often contributed the figures to works by local landscape and perspective painters including Wilhelm Schubert van Ehrenberg.Frans Jozef Peter Van den Branden, Geschiedenis der Antwerpsche schilderschool, Antwerpen, 1883, p. 876 The aforementioned pair of pictures, which were made to be hung next to each other, demonstrate the fantastic, almost surreal, aspects of Peeters' imaginary views. One of the canvases provides an idealized view of a palace with round arched loggias supported by columns and the other of a courtly fa√ßade with a portico and a balustrade on top. The buildings are placed respectively on the left and right and disappear in the distance with foreshortening at the rear. Each painting continues onto a view of an idealized park landscape with a large pond on which float pleasure ships with swans as figureheads. The backdrop is a blue sky with brightly lit, white-gray clouds. The artist enlivened the scene by having light fall through the loggia arches, which contrasts with the architectural fa√ßade, which is in the shade. Groups of figures in the foreground include ladies and gentlemen who are as fanciful as the architecture. The figures are shown in theatrical, stage-like postures, some engaged in conversation. The ladies have towering hairdos and the gentlemen wear turbans or feathered helmets. A black servant carries the train of one of the ladies' dresses. A guard holding a lance is reclining against the fa√ßade of one of the palaces. Some dogs are running among these figures. File:Jacob Peeters - Fantastic courtly architecture with staffage1.jpg Fantastic courtly architecture with staffage File:Jacob Peeters - Fantastic courtly architecture with staffage2.jpg Fantastic courtly architecture with staffage Jacob Balthasar Peeters painted a number of church interiors including of the Jesuit churches of Bruges and Antwerp. This theme was popular in the Low Countries throughout the 17th century. Antwerp artists preferred depicting interiors of high baroque interiors while Dutch artists concentrated on the barren interiors of Protestant churches despoiled of their decorations. In comparison to the earlier church interiors of Flemish and Dutch masters, Peeters' church interiors reflect 18th century artistic preferences through the addition of elegant figures and their attention to detail. One pair of works in the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen dated 1714 depicts the interior of the Jesuit St. Charles Borromeo Church in Antwerp. A pair of views of the same church were recently on the art market (Lempertz Cologne auction of 19 November 2016). The works created in 1721 show the church in the state before part of its decoration was destroyed by fire on 18 July 1718. In the fire, the interior of the church, including ceiling murals painted by Peter Paul Rubens, was destroyed.

History  The writer Arnold Bennett had written a review of Woolf's Jacob's Room (1922) in Cassell's Weekly in March 1923, which provoked Woolf to rebut it. She recorded in her diary in June that Bennett accused her of writing about characters that couldn't survive. Her response was published in the United States in Nation and Athenaeum in December as Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown. The response encouraged her to develop her ideas of cultural relativism further. The following year she presented these ideas as a paper read to the Heretics Society at Cambridge University on 18 May 1924. T.S. Eliot, then editor of The Criterion asked her for an article, and she submitted her talk, which was published in July under the title Character in Fiction and then by the Hogarth Press on 30 October 1924 under its original title as No. 1 of the Hogarth Essays (1924‚Äì1926). The cover was illustrated by Vanessa Bell.  Premise  Woolf addresses what she sees as the arrival of modernism, with the much cited phrase \\"that on or about December 1910 human character changed\\", referring to Roger Fry's exhibition Manet and the Post- Impressionists. She argued that this in turn led to a change in human relations, and thence to change in \\"religion, conduct, politics, and literature\\". She envisaged modernism as inherently unstable, a society and culture in flux. She develops her argument through the examination of two generations of writers. Mr. Bennett was a critic of not just Woolf, but modern writers in general. In particular, Bennett challenged modern writer's depiction of \\"reality\\". Woolf throws out a challenge to Bennett: > \\"Mr. Bennett says that it is only if the characters are real that the novel > has any chance of surviving. Otherwise, die it must. But, I ask myself, what > is reality? And who are the judges of reality?\\" Her argument is that as times change, writers and the tools that they use must evolve, \\"the tools of one generation are useless to the next\\". She places Bennett in the Edwardians, and the subjects of his attacks as \\"Georgians\\" to reflect the change of monarch in 1910 that coincided with Fry's exhibition. She characterises Georgian writers in modernist terms as impressionistic, and those that are \\"telling the truth\\". Her vision of reality is captured in the world of an anonymous woman she has observed, to whom she gives the name \\"Mrs. Brown\\", whose world is to be reflected by modernist writers.  Cover  Bell's modernist cover design shown here was used for the entire essay series, depicting a woman reading, and whose hairs and clothing reflect 1920s style.  Reception  Mr. Bennett and Mrs. Brown has become a key element of the analysis of Woolf's work but also twentieth century literature in general. It eventually contributed to a decline in Bennett's reputation.

The bridge was originally built in 1961, only to be destroyed during the 1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The newly constructed bridge was opened in 2018. History The original ≈Ωe≈æelj Bridge (377 meters long) was a through arch bridge built between 1957 and 1961. It was designed by the prominent Yugoslavian civil engineer Branko ≈Ωe≈æelj and constructed by Mostogradnja. It connected the city area of Novi Sad and Petrovaradin. During its existence, it served as part of an international railway line and as a transit road through Novi Sad. Original bridge damaged in 1999 (before total destruction several days later) During the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, the bridge was bombed 12 times. On 23 April 1999, it was finally destroyed, cutting railway transport between Belgrade and Subotica, i.e. Serbia and Hungary. During the NATO bombing, all three large bridges on Danube river in Novi Sad (≈Ωe≈æelj Bridge, Varadin Bridge and Liberty Bridge) were completely destroyed. In 2000, a temporary Road‚ÄìRailway Bridge was constructed near the ≈Ωe≈æelj Bridge to serve as a replacement of ≈Ωe≈æelj Bridge until the new one was constructed. Over the years, the construction of the new ≈Ωe≈æelj Bridge was postponed several times. In April 2012, the construction works for the new bridge in the same place officially started. The main designer of the new bridge was Aleksandar Bojoviƒá, while the contractor was an international consortium, JV Azvi - Taddei ‚Äì Horta Coslada. The new bridge is visually similar to the destroyed bridge, except that the arches are made from steel and not prestressed concrete. The bridge consists of two arches, the larger one being long and high and the smaller one long and high. In October 2017, the arches of ≈Ωe≈æelj Bridge were connected after five years of construction and eighteen years after the previous bridge was destroyed. As of October 2017, the construction works cost was 51.71 million euros. In April 2018, the bridge was completed and regular rail transport established. The vehicle transit was established on 1 September 2018.

Unlike other forms of time keeping and fills, there is no layering of parts. For example, if playing a cymbal, no other drum set voice, such as a snare or bass drum, would be hit at the same time. Various cymbal ostinatos and other stickings can be used, but are not required. Linear drumming does not refer to any specific function of playing; rather, it applies to grooves, rhythms, and embellishments designed to create musical phrases. The drum kit voices can be combined in any order. One common fill application uses the combination of double stroke rudiments and single stroke rudiments between the hands and feet in a succession of sixteenth notes or triplets. Linear drum beats have appeared in various formats, ranging from shuffle feels, 4/4 feels, double-time feels, half-time feels, swing, and odd time meters. The playing style has steadily gained popularity amongst professional artists worldwide. It has been applied by drummers such as Jeff Porcaro (‚ÄúRosanna‚Äù), David Garibaldi (‚ÄúWhat is Hip‚Äù, ‚ÄúDown to the Nightclub‚Äù, ‚ÄúSoul Vaccination‚Äù, and ‚ÄúOakland Stroke‚Äù), and Steve Gadd (‚ÄúFifty Ways to Leave Your Lover‚Äù).

Synopsis The film, billed as a documentary, follows the misadventures of Elliot \\"White Lighting\\" Scott, a man from Halifax, to make his third martial arts film, Bloodfight, between 2011 and 2013. Scott, an alleged Japanese-Canadian who has allegedly won numerous martial arts championships, has in partnership with his long-suffering girlfriend Linda Lum produced, directed and scripted two previous \\"micro-budget\\" martial arts films starring himself, They Killed My Cat (2009) and The Hero and the Stalker (2010). Despite the low budget of his films and his inability to act, Scott is convinced he will become a great film star. Scott at one point says: \\"I‚Äôm being a superhero for everyone who can‚Äôt be a superhero in the movies\\". Scott talks constantly about his legions of \\"fans\\" that he supposedly has in both Canada and China, but which are never seen in the film. One reviewer, Anthony Harrison, wrote about Scott's film- making attempts: \\"However, Scott makes Ed Wood seem as capable a filmmaker as Orson Welles or Alfred Hitchcock. He doesn‚Äôt make B-movies; even calling Scott‚Äôs films Z-movies compliments them. There exists no letter beyond Z to accurately describe how bad Scott‚Äôs movies are. They‚Äôre shot on digital cameras and feature wooden actors delivering inane dialogue alongside horribly executed effects and fight scenes...No matter how bad the movies are, they‚Äôre driven by a nearly childlike sincerity. Scott has ambitious ideas, but he‚Äôs crippled by a lack of money ‚Äî and talent.\\" Over the course of the film, Scott's relationship with Lum disintegrates owing to his childish, immature character; his unwillingness to propose marriage to Lum, which she clearly wants; and his preference for spending his time using her money to make his martial arts films instead of getting a job. Finally Lum persuades Scott to take a job with a local traditional Chinese medicine clinic, where he studies acupuncture. Scott, a man with an Asian fetish, especially for Asian women, goes to China, ostensibly to study acupuncture and shoot film footage for Bloodfight at the Shaolin Monastery. In China, Scott makes advances upon nearly every woman he meets, says he will soon be making a film with Jackie Chan, claims to have 900 fans on a Facebook group in Beijing (Facebook is not allowed in China), inspires amusement from a Shaolin monk over his inability to perform kung fu properly, and is unable to buy Lum the jade engagement ring she wants. Scott's acupuncture teacher, Dr. Diana Li, complains about his behavior in China: \\"You just trying to meeting all the girls\\". Scott explains his Asian fetish as due to his supposed Japanese descent, claiming to be one- sixth Japanese. Towards the end of the film, Scott is revealed to be a pathological liar and a manipulative man whose life-story is shown to be a fraud. Scott abandons Bloodfight, instead making pornographic films starring himself and various prostitutes. In the last scene, Lum breaks up with Scott concerning a woman he brought to her house the previous night, and he then assaults the cameraman. The film's epilogue states that Scott has never won any martial arts championships and he has disappeared from Halifax. Sharon Lee as an example of the eroticized version of Asian women that appeals to the Asian fetishist Elliot One of the filmmakers behind Kung Fu Elliot, Jaret Belliveau stated: \\"(Elliot‚Äôs) movie is a mind-boggling experience, and the fact that it exists, as a feature, just amazed us. It supposedly won these five awards at the Vancouver 8mm Martial Arts Film Festival, so we were perplexed by him right from the get-go. We confirmed on the Internet that the film fest where he won didn‚Äôt actually exist, but we thought it just added to the mystique of Elliot and the answers he gave to our questions. We thought it was all very innocent; he was still making Blood Fight, and he had this great cast of people around him and a supportive partner, and we didn‚Äôt know how far she was in on these little white lies.\\" Belliveau stated that filming Scott was a frustrating experience as he was constantly lying to them about his supposed exploits and he stated his suspicion that the supposed stalker who was threatening Lum was in fact Scott, who was merely applying the plot of his film The Hero and the Stalker to real life in a bizarre bid to save a relationship that was falling apart. Interviews *Elliot Scott *Linda Lum *Blake Zwicker *Blair Bayers *Dr. Diana Li Reviews On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 86% based on 14 reviews, with an average rating of 6.79/10. Reviewing the film in The New York Times, the critic Daniel Gold wrote: \\"Kung Fu Elliot chronicles his [Scott's] amateurish efforts to make a third feature, Bloodfight which he expects will be his breakthrough. Watching Elliot and his fellows stumble determinedly through shoots, pleasantly delusional about the movie‚Äôs prospects, is mildly amusing, a testament to indie film‚Äôs appeal for a certain hardy strain of dreamer...Upon his return home [from China], reality and fantasy increasingly collide, and Elliot‚Äôs distorted perspective slips into outright lies to friends and documentarians alike. By the abrupt and bizarre end of this odd little film, the question is whether Elliot‚Äôs just a low-grade scam artist or afflicted with a personality disorder. Or both\\". Reviewing the film in The Toronto Star, the critic Peter Howell wrote: \\"What begins as an amusing Project Grizzly-style account about a Canuck dreamer, one who jokes about making \\"acceptable cheese\\" with his movies, gradually becomes something different and darker as we learn one thing after another that mutes the laughter.\\" However, Howell expressed some doubts about the last half of the film, wondering if Belliveau and Bauckman were manipulating Elliot on his self-destructive course. The critic Whitney Mallett wrote the film explored well the delusions of Scott from went from an eccentric underdog to a darkly manipulative type. The critic Sarah Kurchak wrote that Elliot's manipulative behavior was repulsive and the film inspires schadenfreude at his ineptitude and sympathy for Lum. Kurchak also expressed some sympathy for the actor Blake Zwicker, writing his inept \\"unhinged\\" reading \\"To be or Not to be\\" soliloquy from Hamlet was \\"inhumane\\", but his pain over the death of his late girlfriend showed a more sympathetic side to the man.\\" The critic Stephen Faber called the film the story of \\"likable, indefatigable losers\\".\\" The critic Ben Sachs wrote in The Chicago Reader: \\"This Canadian documentary begins like an addition to the cycle, following Elliot Scott, a 30-ish amateur filmmaker, as he embarks on his latest no-budget actioner. Scott believes he can become the next Chuck Norris, and he's indulged by his idiot friends and long-suffering girlfriend (a levelheaded preschool teacher who should know better). As his production derails, however, the tone grows dark and revelations about Scott render him thoroughly unsympathetic. Directors Matthew Bauckman and Jaret Belliveau withhold key information until the third act, forcing one to reevaluate everything that came before, but by then you may already have grown tired of the cheap laughs.\\" The critic Robert Horton wrote: \\"Kung Fu Elliot invites audience mirth at the expense of its collection of Nova Scotia oddballs, but you might not feel so guilty about your laughter by the time the movie reaches its bizarre, late-hatching revelations. There‚Äôs some creepy stuff going on in Halifax, folks...Elliot‚Äôs feeble martial-arts demonstration in front of an actual Shaolin monk is one of the movie‚Äôs indicators that Elliot‚Äôs bravado might not be founded in reality. In short, Elliot starts looking less like a self-deluded dreamer and more like a sociopath. Directors Matthew Bauckman and Jaret Belliveau play the audience quite skillfully here, as the story gradually goes down a disturbing road. It‚Äôs like watching the career of Ed Wood unfold in time-lapse quickness: from gung-ho promoter to ham-handed moviemaker to sleazy purveyor of soft-core (and possibly hard-core) porn. It‚Äôs a strange game for a documentary to play, and it leaves behind a faintly sour taste; you feel especially bad for the people sucked into Elliot‚Äôs high-kicking vortex. (One Blood Fight actor, hung out to dry by Elliot and the doc filmmakers alike, seems to have sprung from the Waiting for Guffman ensemble cast.) I‚Äôm mostly sure Kung Fu Elliot is for real; if not, somebody went to a lot of trouble to create the trailers for Elliot Scott‚Äôs past DVD efforts, such as They Killed My Cat\\". In a review, the critic Chris Klimek wrote that Kung Fu Elliot was entertaining, but that: \\"Kung Fu Elliot‚Äôs violent climax arrives so swiftly, it raises the question of whether everything preceding it has been a hoax.\\" In a review, the critic Casey Tourangeau questioned if the Kung Fu Elliot was really a documentary, stating the film felt \\"staged\\". Likewise, the critic Michael Rechtshafen wrote in The LA Times:\\"Well before that point arrives, when the affably goofy portrait takes a decidedly darker turn, one begins to suspect that directors Matthew Bauckman and Jaret Belliveau, just like their subject, might have been playing fast and loose with the truth. As presented, even the sweetly delusional Scott, with his heavy Canadian accent and doughy face, would have made for such a terrific SCTV character that it's hard to completely accept that he's the real deal\\". In a review, Kevin Jagernauth wrote about the efforts of Bauckman and Belliveau that the film was involving, but at the last act seemed implausible, leading him to suspect the film was staged. The critic Etlan Adler wrote the film's: \\"...lively portrait of Elliot Scott, a Canadian martial-arts enthusiast with the dream of becoming his country‚Äôs first major action-movie star, always feels a little too good to be true. It‚Äôs not just the way that Scott‚Äôs delusions of grandeur make him resemble an extra from a Christopher Guest mockumentary; the entire production plays like a sly riff on the hit 1999 documentary American Movie, where director Chris Smith chronicled the low-budget filmmaking exploits of a modern-day Ed Wood, Mark Borchardt...And some cursory Googling brings up both an official Facebook page and Twitter feed for Scott‚Äîalthough the latter notably hasn‚Äôt been updated since 2012‚Äîas well as his production company‚Äôs website, Bad Acting Good Kung Fu Canada, which includes links to local press stories about him...But that doesn‚Äôt entirely erase lingering doubts that this whole thing might be an elaborate put-on, doubts that arise from the way the story unfolds and the behavior exhibited by both Scott and some of the supporting players in his life, including producer/girlfriend Linda Lum and buddy/co-star Blake Zwicker, who could be the Canadian cousin of American Movie sidekick Mike Schank...The fact that Kung Fu Elliot ultimately follows the same \\"fall from grace\\" arc that's present in so many fictional \\"star is born\\" narratives is another subtle indication that things aren‚Äôt necessarily what they appear to be. The movie ends with Scott conveniently fleeing Canada for parts unknown (possibly China) and neither he nor Lum appear to have stepped forward since to confirm or deny the movie's account of the final years of their professional and personal relationship.\\" The critic David Shreve argued that the film was not an \\"outright lie\\", but \\"there‚Äôs also no reason to believe that directors Matthew Bauckman and Jaret Belliveau didn‚Äôt have access to the big tone- shifting revelation until roughly the last week of Kung Fu Elliot in their two year filming stretch, which is what the film‚Äôs form and construction would have you believe. That information was knowingly back-pocketed until the right moment. Have whatever debate you would like regarding whether omission qualifies as deceit, but this sort of withholding certainly doesn‚Äôt constitute an act of honesty in the language of documentary film.\\" About the debate over the veracity of the film, critic Rob Hunter wrote: \\"There are moments in the third act that might test the trust of viewers suspecting a staged interaction or line reading, but by all accounts what we see is real. It‚Äôs easy to question as Scott and his cohorts are at times too ridiculously bad at what they do, but their sincerity is on equal display.\\" Awards *Fantastic Fest Jury Award 2014-Best Documentary Feature. *Slamdance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize 2014-Best Documentary Feature Notes  External links  *Kung Fu Elliot *Kung Fu Elliot trailer *Kung Fu Elliot Category:Canadian films Category:Films set in Canada Category:Canadian documentary films Category:Films set in Atlantic Canada Category:Films shot in Nova Scotia Category:Films set in Nova Scotia Category:Films shot in Halifax, Nova Scotia ","title":"Kung Fu Elliot"},{"id":"57016820","text":"Pace Academy is a private school located in 77 Sergeant Rivera Street, Barangay Manresa, Quezon City, Metro Manila, Philippines.

Arkansas voters chose nine representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. Background Except for the Unionist Ozark counties of Newton and Searcy where Republicans controlled local government, Arkansas since the end of Reconstruction had been a classic one-party Democratic ‚ÄúSolid South‚Äù state.See Urwin, Cathy Kunzinger; Agenda for Reform: Winthrop Rockefeller as Governor of Arkansas, 1967-71, p. 32 Disfranchisement of effectively all Negroes and most poor whites by a poll tax since 1890 meant that outside those two aberrant counties, the Republican Party was completely moribund and Democratic primaries the only competitive elections. Increased voting by poor Ozark whites as a protest against Woodrow Wilson's internationalist foreign policy meant that Warren G. Harding in 1920 was able to win almost forty percent of the statewide vote;Phillips, Kevin P.; The Emerging Republican Majority, pp. 211, 287 and 1928 saw the rest of the Outer South and North Alabama bolt the anti-Prohibition Catholic Al Smith. However, the presence of Arkansas Senator Joseph Taylor Robinson as running mate meant that within Arkansas only the most northwesterly counties with ordinarily substantial Republican votes suffered the same fate.Barnes, Kenneth C.; Anti-Catholicism in Arkansas: How Politicians, the Press, the Klan, and Religious Leaders Imagined an Enemy, 1910‚Äì1960, pp. 164-165 The following years saw Arkansas plunge into the Great Depression, followed almost immediately by a major drought from the summer of 1930s until the winter of 1931/1932.Whayne, Jeannie M.; DeBlack, Thomas A.; Sabo, George and Arnold, Morris S.; Arkansas: A Narrative History, pp. 341-342 Arkansas gave extremely heavy support to Democrat Franklin Roosevelt in the 1932 election.Grantham, Dewey W.; The Life and Death of the Solid South: A Political History, p. 102 Roosevelt won every county in the state, and was extremely popular in the ‚ÄúSolid South‚Äù throughout his first term.Leuchtenburg, William E.; The White House Looks South: Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson, p. 51 although his popularity lessened somewhat during his second term due to the urban and labor bias of the New Deal, Roosevelt remained in no danger in 1940. This was especially true given that the South had never experienced German or Scandinavian immigration and thus strongly sympathized ‚Äì as FDR did ‚Äì with Britain in World War II.Dunn, Susan; 1940: FDR, Willkie, Lindbergh, Hitler ‚Äì the Election Amid the Storm, p. 57 Thus FDR was able to almost maintain his 1936 majority in the Natural State, and replicated the county map of 1896, 1916, 1924 and 1936.

The co-founder of the temple, Jeffrey Zlotnik, was in Beta Theta Pi in college and suggested creating a Buddhist fraternity as a way to find a way to instill college students with Buddhist principles that would follow them throughout college and for the rest of their lives. Dharma Bum Temple chose SDSU to build the first chapter of the fraternity because it already had a strong presence on the campus from running an SDSU meditation club called \\"The Aztec Dharma Bums\\". There was originally plans to create one Buddhist fraternity and one Buddhist sorority, but it was eventually decided to create one co-ed fraternity. In 2017, the fraternity announced plans to start another chapter at University of California, San Diego (UCSD) as well.  Principles  Delta Beta Tau Pledge Class 2018 in meditation The co-ed fraternity takes the Six Paramitas of Mahayana Buddhism as the founding principles of the fraternity. The rules for the fraternity are based on Buddhist principles and to join pledges do community service and attend meditation retreats. Activities the fraternity offers include meditation retreats, guest speakers and community service events, with social gatherings incorporating mindfulness into them. As of January 2018, there are no official Greek houses for Delta Beta Tau members to live together in, instead meetings are held at locations near the campuses until Greek housing for the fraternity can be established. Once Greek housing is set up, the fraternity plans on having house rules based on Buddhist principles and for the fraternity to hold normal Greek events such as formals and dating dashes, but with Buddhist values and mindfulness elements incorporated.  Service  Delta Beta Tau's service programs are largely entwined with the outreach programs of Dharma Bum Temple, the temple that helped organize the founding of the fraternity. The fraternity focuses on community service, taking the principles of Buddhism as the basis for its values. Fraternity members are trained in guiding meditation so they can teach meditation to the community as a form of community service. Other outreach programs the fraternity hosts include volunteer work at local animal shelters, as well as participating in the existing prison outreach and homeless feeding programs that are hosted by Dharma Bum Temple.

It was the first such action in Oklahoma since 1990. The OEA declared an end to the strike on April 12 after an agreement to increase salaries and state funding for education was reached. The call to end the strike faced some objection from teachers and parents who do not believe that enough concessions were made by lawmakers. Unlike the similar action in West Virginia, the strike was not a \\"wildcat\\" strike, as it received endorsement from union leadership, albeit only after pressure from teachers. The protest occurred concurrent with similar protests in Arizona, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Colorado. Background =State of public education in Oklahoma= Since 2008, education spending per student in Oklahoma has fallen 28%. Due to the decrease in funding, twenty percent of schools run on four-day weeks, and many have eliminated art and language classes and shut down sports programs. Gains from last teachers' strike in Oklahoma, in 1990, which resulted in an agreement to lower class sizes, expand kindergarten programs, and increase teacher wages were later reversed due to budget cuts. The decline in funding and subsequent decline in the quality of public education has resulted in the expansion of charter schools in the state. =Plans for a Walkout= In 2016, State Question 779 was placed on the ballot, but failed to gain enough votes. SQ 779 propsed a one cent increase in sales tax and was estimated to bring in $615 million for education funding (including educator pay raises) in its first year. Failure of SQ 779 left many educators frustrated. Support for a strike began to build in early March of 2018, after another proposal (dubbed the \\"Step Up\\" plan) failed to pass the required 75% threshold for tax increases. The \\"Step Up\\" plan would have increased certain taxes and boosted teacher pay by $5,000. Both Democrats and Republicans voted for and against the bill. Some Democrats who voted \\"no\\" believed the plan did not go far enough to restore funding. Plans for a strike beginning on April 2 were first floated in March. On April 2, schools throughout Oklahoma were scheduled to take standardized tests; preventing these tests from taking place could potentially jeopardize millions in federal funds allocated to Oklahoma. After the Oklahoma legislature passed a tax increase to fund teach pay raises with the required 75% in each body on Friday, March 30, a strike beginning on the 2nd was announced. Thus, even before the walkout, teachers won greater school funding and salary increases, funded in part by increases in the cigarette tax, motor fuel tax, and the gross production tax on petroleum. Walkout The strike lasted from April 2nd to April 12th. Strike leaders had called for the introduction of a capital gains tax to avoid a regressive tax, but the terms were nevertheless accepted. The legislature passed no further tax increases after the walkout began. =Salary demands= Public school teacher salaries in Oklahoma prior to the strike were the third lowest in the United States (after South Dakota and Mississippi), resulting in some teachers and staffers working second or third jobs. An initial offer of a $6,000 wage increase, ratified by the governor, was rejected, as the initial demands were for a $10,000 raise for teachers and a $1250 raise for support staff. Reactions from state officials Governor Mary Fallin likened teacher demands to \\"...teenager(s) wanting a better car\\". The quote was appropriated by teachers and used in chants during protests at the Oklahoma State Capitol. State representative Kevin McDugle, a Republican, indicated he would not pass any bill or measure to increase education spending due to the protests undertaken by the teachers. Results A survey in 2019 found that the pay raise obtained by the strike had lifted the State's teacher pay ranking to 34th in the nation, higher than the surrounding states of New Mexico, Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas, but still lower than Colorado or Texas. Ten Republican representatives who were opposed to raising taxes to increase teacher salaries were up for re-election in 2018. Two, Scott McEachin and Chuck Strohm, were eliminated by other Republican nominees during the initial primary, while a further seven did not gain enough votes to win their primaries uncontested. These seven faced runoff elections in August 2018, and six lost.

The project did this by simulating an online competition in which all four presidential candidates: Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, Josefina V√°zquez Mota, and Gabriel Quadri, were given certain topics based on the Mexican national agenda and had to come up with a solution. After the candidates published their policies, the platform unanimously published them on their website and Mexican citizens were in charge of voting for what they believed was the best policy. Presumably, the goal of the platform was to allow Mexican citizens to vote for the policymaker that shared the same ideas as them instead of voting for a candidate based on party affiliations or other types of bias.  Background  The software was developed and designed by a much larger organization known as Fundaci√≥n Ethos and supported by the United Nations Population Fund and by National Endowment for Democracy (NED) of the United States. Fundaci√≥n Ethos is an international group of economists, lawyers, communicators, web designers, and political scientists, all who have experience in government and policymaking. However, with its headquarters located in Mexico City, the organization mainly works to achieve its goals first in Mexico and Latin America. = Software = Arena Electoral 2.0 as it is currently known was developed and produced under Fundaci√≥n Ethos. The project was both an online platform and cellular application, with its online form still accessible.  Funding  The platform was created by a non- profit, independent and non-partisan organization that is financed by contributions from individuals and international organizations, with short contributions. Arena Electoral states that they do not provide any product in exchange for their services, do not give or sell pantries, hats, shirts or pictures for your car. They do not sell or give anything away, although they have considered selling t-shirts with their logo printed on them, for now, nothing is sold on their site. = Principles = On its webpage, Arena Electoral lists nine main principles in which they presumably aimed to follow and keep in order to have remained as neutral as possible. Their first principle and notice are that they were not in the business of giving out/selling items, pantries, hats, shirts or pictures for your car. Their second principle is in regards to advertising. Arena Electoral state that they did advertise on their site, but according to them it was only used as a necessity to pay for their \\"discrete\\" salaries. However, according to them they did not accept (nor will we ever accept) money or resources from candidates or companies that intentioned to modify Arena Electoral's opinions, analyzes, or evaluations based on their donations. Furthermore, in their third principle Arena Electoral address and talk about their allies. They claim that fortunately, there were many organizations allied to the platform. There were some partners who they previously had collaborated with and others who they state they only sympathized with. Arena Electoral say that they even got to know partners as well as a result of the platform, which accordingly allowed them to inform and spread their proposals. At the end of the section Arena Electoral make a disclaimer saying that the information that their partners decided to share in their platform was generated independently without the intervention of their own team or any of the other organizations that participated in the project, and as a result claimed that everyone was free and responsible to propose anything on the site. Furthermore, Arena Electoral's fourth principle titled \\"APPARATUS\\" claims that they were 100% nonpartisan and independent of any candidate or party. They claim that no member of their team was allowed to participate directly in the campaign of any of the candidates they evaluated on the platform. Their fifth principles are in regards to conduct. Arena Electoral clearly state that they did not accept gifts from any of the candidates or their people. Their sixth principle addresses media. They acknowledge that some of their members appeared on television to give opinions, but that they were independent of the project since they were only spokespersons of Arena Electoral when they presented themselves as such. Nonetheless, their following principle is titled \\"CONFLICT OF INTERESTS.\\" In this section, they state that any member of the Arena Electoral team who had a husband or wife, boyfriend or girlfriend, partner or a close relationship with a candidate, or member of their team, was known on their personal information. In the following section (eighth principle), Arena Electoral address the opinions that were shared or published on the site. They presumably claim that any opinions or editorialized material that was on the platform were made explicit. That is, they claim that any opinion that appeared on the platform was the sole opinion of that person and should not have been considered a formal opinion supported by Arena Electoral as a whole or its associates in particular. The ninth and final principle that Arena Electoral aimed to implement on their platform was the use of the page. In this final section the platform claim that users of the page were invited to make good use of it. Arena Electoral state that any forums that were disrespectful, aggressive, insulting and used words that did not dignify the debate and democratic deliberation was eliminated. In other words, Arena Electoral claim that they did not permit any type of harassment of unethical behavior on the platform.  Mission  The main goal of Arena Electoral was to promote responsible voting. They aimed to achieve this by making citizens aware on which candidate was the most fitting policy maker in accordance with their own ideas. = Safe-space for Citizens to communicate to each other = Arena Electoral also aimed to be a platform for citizens to express and publish their own opinions without having to worry about party or candidate affiliations. In other words, the platform was also aimed to be a safe-space for citizens according to Arena Electoral.  Promote responsible voting  In order to promote responsible voting, Arena electoral created a tool within their platform called Votom√°tico. Votom√°tico was a questionnaire containing 25 questions, all based on five major themes: security and justice; economic development; social development and the environment; human rights and State Reform, and Foreign Policy. The results were anonymous unless you chose to share them on social media. The questionnaire in Votom√°tico was multiple choice and each question had five different answers. From those five answers, you picked the one that most likely matched your way of thinking. After answering every question, according to Arena Electoral, the exercise would show which candidate you have the most affinity with. With Votom√°tico Arena Electoral aimed to show citizens with which of the four presidential candidates they were more inclined to. However, according to Fundaci√≥n Ethos, the tool was not created to induce suffrage in favor of a specific candidate and/or political party. Instead, presumably Votom√°tico was developed so citizens could know the proposals of the candidates and from that identify with whom they shared similar ideas.  How It Works  The way Arena Electoral functioned was that the four presidential candidates received questions based on eleven topics regarding the national agenda. The topics were as followed: # Health # Education # Science and Technology # Culture # Human rights # Economic Development # Sustainable Development # Social Improvement # Security and Justice # Foreign Policy # State Reforms After giving their proposals on the topic, the candidates were then evaluated by more than 200 experts including academics from both public and private universities. The evaluators according to Arena Electoral, scored the candidates based on their responsibility, viability, feasibility, all while withholding the platform's principles and aspirations. = Results = The final result showed Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador as the winner with 5.7. Enrique Pe√±a Nieto, the current president of Mexico came in second with 5.2. Consequently, Josefina V√°zquez Mota came in third with 4.4 and with the lowest score came in Gabriel Quadric with 2.8.  Legacy  Currently, Arena Electoral is still up and running and now serves as an informative site that still, according to them, aims to explain to citizens the power of voting and its importance, all while guiding in what is needed to express this right in Mexico or abroad. Nonetheless, the site still contains all previous articles, editorials, related texts and past proposals of the previous candidates.

In subsequent violence, ten people died and hundreds were injured. Background The Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 protects the SC/ST caste groups. The act does not allow the court to grant anticipatory bail to accused person. The police must file a First Information Report (FIR) and arrest the accused on receiving a complaint. In 2016, the conviction rate under the act was 25.7% in cases of atrocities against SC and 20.8% in cases against ST in 2016, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. On 20 March 2018, the Supreme Court of India ruled that no arrests can be made without prior permission and allowed a court to grant an anticipatory bail if it, prima facie, finds the complaint an abuse of the law. The Attorney General of India, on behalf of the Government of India, filed a review petition against the order of the Supreme Court. Protests The people from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (SC/ST) protested against the Supreme Court order. Thousands of people took to the streets on 2 April 2018, when a national strike was announced by representatives of the SC/ST caste groups in protest of the decision. The protests turned violent across several states in India as the protestors blocked trains, damaged property, and clashed with police and other civilians. There were also incidents involving arson, vandalism and gunfire. At least fourteen people were killed: nine in Madhya Pradesh, Three in Uttar Pradesh, two in Rajasthan; hundreds of others were injured. Violent incidents were also reported in the states Punjab, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha, Gujarat, Haryana, Maharashtra and Delhi. A mob burnt the house of Bharosi Lal Jatav, a former Indian National Congress (INC) legislator, and ransacked the home of Rajkumari Jatav, a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislator from Hindaun, Rajasthan. A curfew was imposed in Hindaun following the violence, and later extended. Twenty four government vehicles and sixty private vehicles were damaged in Haryana. 84 police officials and eight civilians were injured during the violence on 2 April in Haryana. Nine policemen were injured in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh. Response Thousands of protesters were arrested and curfew was imposed in several places. 1700 anti-riot police were sent to states by the Government of India. Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) (which prohibits assembly of more than four people) was imposed in Haridwar, Uttarakhand. Police had filed reports against 5,000 unidentified and 285 named miscreants, while 32 agitators were arrested under various sections of the Indian Penal Code in Ghaziabad. At least fifteen FIRs were registered by the police in Ludhiana, Punjab against hundreds of unidentified protesters for alleged road blockades and for causing obstructions. The Haryana Police booked around 4,000 persons and 100 others were arrested for indulging in violence while as many as 47 FIRs were lodged. The internet services were suspended in Punjab and Rajasthan.  Aftermath  The Supreme Court held hearing on the review petition on 3 April 2018 but did not stay the order and have called to hear the matter in ten days.

The purpose of yarn engineering is to optimize the performance and minimize the cost of textile products through the process of selecting the most effective raw materials, fiber type, manufacturing method, and yarn structure[1]. Yarn is a versatile fiber used in fabric-making. The methods in which it is constructed as well as its individual properties determine the properties of the final product. The process of manufacturing yarn is complex, and each step in this process can change the porosity, thinness, and flexibility of the final fabric[2]. The steps of yarn-making are carding, combing, drawing out, twisting, and spinning.  Yarn classifications  Yarns are made from either natural or synthetic fibers. There are differences between the two, and one type may be chosen over another depending on the goals of the manufacturer. The two most common classifications in yarn making are staple-spun and continuous-filament yarn. Staple spun yarn consists of fibers that have restricted lengths, while continuous filament fibers are made up of long strands[3]. The fibers listed below are the most common fibers used today and are provided as exemplary fibers. However, there are other less common fibers that can fall into the natural and synthetic categories. For additional research, other raw materials include flax, mohair, acrylic fiber, and more. = Synthetic = Synthetic fibers are easier to handle than natural fibers, and the process for making them requires much less energy and time. Most synthetic fibers are continuous filaments and made in chemical factories. * Polyesters are durable fibers resistant to stretching and shrinking, often used in clothing. * Rayons are thin fibers made from cellulose used to make comfortable clothes. * Nylons are complex synthetic fibers with many uses. Properties vary depending on manufacturing methods. = Natural = Natural fibers normally fall into the staple spun category and require much more experience and time to manufacture. Large technological advancements continue to make manufacturing natural fibers simpler and have contributed to them still being viable resources. * Cotton is the most commonly used staple spun yarn. It is used in clothing, coffee filters, book binding, etc. * Wool is another common textile that must go through a purification process involving the removal of animal fat and plant based matter before being made into yarn at a spinning mill. * Silk is the only natural continuous filament fiber. It has a reputation of being soft and comfortable. It is produced by silkworms and cultivated on farms.  Manufacturing process  As stated above, each step in the process of making fiber into yarn is unique and can contribute different properties to the yarn. These steps are carding, combing, drawing out, twisting, and spinning[4]. = Carding = A card is the first machine for spinning preparation. Carding is a process that cleans, disentangles, and blends slivers, which prepares the fibers to be spun into yarn. Carding causes parallelizing of the fibers, mixes, drafts, and forms slivers. (Gries) = Combing = Combing occurs after the carding process. It is an extra processing stage that removes short fibers and contaminants and causes fiber parallelization. Combing cotton, for example, allows for yarns of finer titer to be spun, higher production speeds, and the reduction of yarn twist and breakage. (Gries) = Drawing Out = During the drawing process, the fibers are drafted which further reduce the weight per yard of the fiber. The fibers are further straightened by drawing, which causes the randomized directions of the macromolecules to be oriented in the fiber direction and a decrease in fiber diameter. (Gries, Richards) = Twisting = A ring spinning machine. Twisting is the process which binds fibers or yarn together for added tenacity, especially in staple fiber yarn. More twist is added during each process to hold the fibers together to create yarn. The direction and the amount of twist will have an influence on the properties of the yarn. =Spinning= Spinning has been a part of human culture since thousands of years before the Middle Ages. In early years, it was very slow and required a lot of work. In 1828, an American named Thorp, advanced spinning techniques by creating ring spinning. In 1967, commercial rotor-spinning was created, another improvement on ring-spinning. And then in the 1970s, air-jet and friction-spinning became popular. * Ring-spun Ring-spinning is one of the oldest methods of making yarn. Yarn is fed through the front dating rolls by the pigtail guide to the ring. The ring twirls around the bobbin, wrapping the yarn around the bobbin. The spindle rail moves up and down so that the yarn wraps around the bobbin evenly. * Rotor-spun Rotor-spinning is mostly used for cotton and is up to ten times faster than ring-spinning. Material is fed through the feed and the open roller individualizes the strands. It is then fed to the yarn arm through the fibre transportation tube. The rotor then spins the yarn around the rolling yarn arm, creating yarn. * Air jet-spun Air- jet spinning was the next advancement in spinning technology. Material is fed through the spinners to individualize the strands up to the spinning head. Air jets spin the yarn by creating air pressure through a spinning vortex. This weaved yarn is then fed through the spinning head to the winding stage. The winding stage is similar to rotor spinning, where the yarn is wound around a yarn arm[5].  Textile engineering  Yarn engineering is an important sector of the textile industry, where yarn engineers work with textile engineers and machinery to create the most efficient mill possible. Advancing technology has made looms faster. With this increase in speed, engineers must consider the type of yarn they can use. It must be able to withstand higher velocity and acceleration, higher frequency of shed opening, and more energetic weaving motions[6]. Modern looms are automatic, so the yarn should minimize the potential machine stoppage that would stop the loom. One way to prevent stoppages is weaving in a more ideal condition with low humidity and temperature[7].

Its goal is to improve living conditions for inmates in California. Purpose The Prisoner Human Rights Movement wanted to address inadequacies in the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation, including: # Systemic problems in 180- and 270-designed (level 4) prisons and institutions, including chains of command, staff assessment and Department of Corrections culture # Prisoners' Inmate Welfare Funds (IWF) and budget allocations # Injustice, brutality and human- rights violations To deal with these issues, the Pelican Bay organizers called for the right to document, expose and challenge abuses and violations; an end to violence and brutality by prison employees; an end to police brutality, inside and outside prison, and the right to safety from retaliation and coercion, threats and blackmail to betray fellow prisoners with false accusations. Background Pelican Bay State Prison, California‚Äôs only supermax prison, was built in 1989 on the outskirts of Crescent City. Half the prison houses maximum-security inmates in the general population, and the other half holds prisoners in Security Housing Units. Cells in the latter are windowless, concrete boxes. Inmates are confined to the cells for twenty-two to twenty-three hours a day without access to telephones, television, programs, loved ones and basic human interaction. They receive three meals a day through a small slot at the bottom of their cell door. Inmates housed in the Security Housing Units are subjected to abuse from other inmates and guards. Inmates are sent to the Security Housing Units at the discretion of correctional administrators. They are sent for a fixed term for breaking a prison rule, or for an indeterminate term for being labeled a prison-gang member. The largest segments of Security Housing Units populations are jailhouse lawyers and political activists. Although inmates identified as gang members are not supposed to be isolated for more than six years, the prison- gang investigation unit often finds new evidence to extend an inmate‚Äôs isolation. The only way for these prisoners to leave the Security Housing Units is to debrief. An inmate debriefs by divulging information incriminating other inmates as gang associates. Although inmates (or their families) who debrief can become targets of violence by gangs, they often provide false information about others to escape the Security Housing Units. Assignments in the Security Housing Units can also affect sentencing length and severity. Inmates do not earn credit for time served in the Security Housing Units, extending their sentence and making them eligible for release later than they would otherwise be. Inmates sentenced to life imprisonment are not eligible for parole while they are in the Security Housing Units. For many inmates, the only options for escape are debriefing or death. This essentially removes sentencing from the judiciary and gives it to prison administrators. In 2007, inmates in the Pelican Bay Security Housing Units spent an average of over two years in isolation before being released into the general population or paroled; some have spent decades in solitary confinement. Every month, about 15 prisoners are paroled from the Security Housing Units with no services to assist with the transition from isolation to freedom. Movement In response to the treatment of prisoners housed in Pelican Bay's Security Housing Units, four inmates (Arturo Castellanos, Sitawa Nantambu Jamaa (Ronnie Dewberry), Todd Ashker and George Franco) began the Prisoner Human Rights Movement. As the movement's principal negotiators, they have organized around the belief that the Department of Corrections is fraught with systemic, deep-rooted problems. The movement's goal is immediate action by the governor of California to remedy the Department of Correction's policies and enforcement and to encourage lawmakers to create effective and genuine improvements to the department. In addition to the principal negotiators, the Prisoner Human Rights Movement is composed of twenty representatives, local councils and the plaintiffs in Ashker v. Brown. The principal negotiators, the movement's face and driving force, represent over 100,000 inmates in thirty-three California prisons. Representatives and local councils monitor and record conditions at their prisons, reporting to the principal negotiators. On April 3, 2011, the Pelican Bay negotiators issued five core demands. Hunger strikes =2011= On July 1, 2011, a hunger strike began. Nearly every prisoner in the Pelican Bay Security Housing Units (over 1,000 inmates) was refusing food, and they were joined by general-population inmates. By the end of the first day, about 6,000 prisoners across California had reportedly participated in the hunger strike. Though levels of participation varied (from inmates partaking only in food purchased from canteens, to liquid sustenance, to refusal of any and all sustenance) the most involved organizers made it clear that they were willing to starve to death to have their demands met. In the first week, supporters on the outside were also engaging with the movement by fasting and participating in solidarity demonstrations across the state. Within the next few weeks, prison and state officials scrambled to deal with the strike. Some prisons used deceptive tactics, like lying about meeting the demands of the strike, or spreading rumors that an inmate had died, attempting to break solidarity between prisoners. Other prisons further isolated prisoners participating in the hunger strike, cutting off communications between the prisoners and the outside world. As the strike wore on, state officials threatened to force feed inmates who were refusing food, though this action is illegal in most cases. Three weeks into the hunger strike, the CDCR agreed to enter negotiations with the Pelican Bay PNs and immediately conceded on a few points. The strike officially ended on July 20. However, most conditions within the prison remained largely unchanged. The hunger strike resumed on September 26, with about 12,000 people in California and other states participating in the strike. It was called off on October 15, 2011. =2013= The 59-day 2013 California prisoner hunger strike, organized by the Pelican Bay PNs (who became known as the Short Corridor Collective), mobilized 30,000 prisoners across the state. The strike ended when a judge issued a court order allowing the strikers to be force-fed by the state. Legal remedies Ashker v. Governor of California (or Ashker v. Brown) was a class action lawsuit filed on May 31, 2012 by the Pelican Bay Hunger Strike negotiators on behalf of inmates housed in Security Housing Units. The case was an amended version of an earlier pro se lawsuit filed by Pelican Bay Security Housing Units inmates Todd Ashker and Danny Troxell. Judge Claudia Ann Wilken of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California presided over the case. It was settled in September 2015, ending indiscriminate solitary confinement in California. After the settlement, nearly 1,500 prisoners were transferred from Security Housing Units to the general population. Many inmates were sent to Level VI housing, however, which mimicked solitary confinement. In March 2018, a federal court refused to order the Department of Corrections to release long-term Security Housing Units inmates into the general population. The defense counsel noted that the earlier settlement was inadequate for ending indeterminate isolated imprisonment in California. =International law= In August 2011, the United Nations General Assembly published a Human Rights Council report on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. The report outlines the international consensus that solitary confinement in pretrial detention for more than fifteen days of juveniles or people with mental disabilities is \\"cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and even torture\\". It describes best practices for states to limit solitary confinement. The report was crucial as a legal defense to the movement's claim that prolonged solitary confinement is a form of torture and a human-rights violation under international law.

He experienced the longest career of any Cape Dorset artist, and is a member of the Order of Canada and the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts. Early life Kiugak was born to Inuit artist Pitseolak and her husband, Ashoona, in the community of Tariugajak on Baffin Island, Northwest Territories (now Nunavut), on September 16, 1933. He was one of the last generations to be born on the land and raised with the traditional lifestyle of the Inuit people. In 1945, after the death of his father, Kiugak's mother relocated her family to the community of Cape Dorset, over away, to be closer to relatives. Pitseolak and her children were introduced to the carving trade in Cape Dorset. In 1947, Kiugak's first carving made from walrus tusk was traded to the Baffin Trading Company by his brother, Qaquq, for some large biscuits. As art grew as a new economic opportunity and hunting declined, Kiugak, like many Inuit people, transitioned from hunting to creating and selling carvings. His work focused primarily on scenes of Inuit life, such as hunting scenes, with some animal carvings. Artistic career In 1951, Kiugak was introduced to James Houston, an artist from southern Canada who was sent to Cape Dorset to collect Inuit carvings for the Canadian Arts and Craft's Guild. Houston and Kiugak worked together to expand carving in the community. Sometime in the 1950s, Kiugak married Punisti in Igali, a community east of Cape Dorset. He lived with her father Kiakshuk, a renowned angakkuq (shaman) and artist. During this time Kiugak became aware of the shamanic culture and history and incorporated these themes into his later work. After Punisti's death, Kiugak married graphic artist Sorosiluto in 1960, and had multiple children, both natural and adopted. His eldest child is contemporary Inuk artist Shuvinai Ashoona (born 1961). Kiugak Ashoona is a self-taught artist. During his childhood, he would often create drawings using pencil with little influence from others in his life. During the 1940s, Kiugak began creating sculptures out of ivory. After meeting with Houston, Kiugak transitioned to stone sculpture as this was widely popular in southern art markets. Many of his sculptures at this time were of more naturalistic human figures with themes of hunting and other traditional Inuit activities. In the early 1960s, he took a great interest in conveying Inuit mythology and shamanism through his sculpture. While Kiugak is most famous for his carvings, he experimented in other mediums such as drawing, painting, and printmaking. He first began printmaking in 1962, using stone-cut engraving. From 1977 to 1981, Kiugak took an interest in acrylic painting, basing his style off Kingmeata Etidlooie, one of the first artists in Cape Dorset to take up this medium. In 1980, Kiugak created drawings using graphite and a combination of coloured pencil and felt-tip pen. During this time, he experimented with creating photorealistic drawings, but ultimately stopped because it was difficult to transfer such detailed drawings into stone carvings. Prior to his death in 2014, Kiugak had the longest artistic career of any artist living in Cape Dorset. Along with his many awards and honours, his sculpture Sedna was featured on a Canadian postal stamp in 1980 as part of a series celebrating Inuit culture. Kiugak's work has been featured in over 75 exhibits both within Canada and internationally. Awards and honours Kiugak received multiple honours including: * National Aboriginal Achievement Award (1997) * Canada Council for the Arts Molson Prize (1999) * Officer of the Order of Canada (2000) * Appointed to the Royal Canadian Academy (2001) *Queen Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee Medal (2002) * Nunavut Commissioner's Art Award (2009) *Queen Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee Medal (2012) See also *Napachie Pootoogook, Kiugak Ashoona's sister  References  Category:1933 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Inuit from the Northwest Territories Category:Inuit sculptors Category:Inuit printmakers Category:Inuit painters Category:Artists from Nunavut Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:20th-century Canadian sculptors Category:21st-century Canadian sculptors Category:People from Kinngait Category:Inuit from Nunavut ","title":"Kiugak Ashoona"},{"id":"57017315","text":"William Gaver is a co-director of the Interaction Research Studio. as well as a Professor of Design Department at Goldsmiths, University of London since 2005.

It forms hybrids with other species of Diuris. Description Diuris platichila is a tuberous, perennial herb with two linear leaves long, wide and folded lengthwise. Between two and eight yellow flowers with dark markings on the dorsal sepal and labellum, wide are borne on a flowering stem tall. The dorsal sepal is erect, long and wide. The lateral sepals are long, wide and turned downwards. The petals are erect, egg-shaped to elliptic, long and wide on a reddish brown stalk long. The labellum is long and has three lobes. The centre lobe is wedge-shaped, long and wide and folded lengthwise. The side lobes are long and about wide. There are two thick callus ridges long near the mid-line of the labellum. Flowering occurs in September and October. Taxonomy and naming Diuris platichila was first formally described in 1888 by Robert FitzGerald and the description was published in his book Australian Orchids. Distribution and habitat The Blue Mountains doubletail grows in isolated populations in the Blue Mountains. It was previously more common in the area but has declined due to habitat loss and hybridisation with other species, including D. chryseopsis and D. bracteata.

Retrieved from National Library of Australia 1 April 2018. But this proposal also stalled. Following a council tramway committee being established in 1906, Queensland's chief railway engineer Henry Charles Stanley was commissioned by the Rockhampton Council in 1907 to investigate the feasibility of a steam tramway system in Rockhampton. Despite debates on whether an electric system would be preferable to a steam tramway, it was recommended the self-propelled steam cars with small enclosed steam engine be used, namely the French Purrey steam cars designed by acclaimed Bordeaux manufacturer and civil engineer Valentin Purrey.Tramway Question, The Morning Bulletin, 18 October 1907.

Having previously observed the Purrey steam cars in Paris, Stanley gave assurances the Purrey steam cars were clean, neat and comfortable compared to the Sydney Steam Motor Trams which ran in Sydney which Stanley described as \\"highly objectionable, noisy, dirty and dangerous\\". Original 1909‚Äì1939 service The service was officially opened by Queensland Premier (and Member for Rockhampton) William Kidston on the morning of 5 June 1909 with the inaugural tram service departing from a decorative arch at the intersection of Bolsover and William Street in Rockhampton City and making its way to the Rockhampton Botanic Gardens on The Range.Rockhampton Tramways: The Opening Ceremony, The Morning Bulletin, 7 June 1909. Retrieved from National Library of Australia 1 April 2018. On its first day of operation, 7,600 passengers were transported by the new tramway service. The trams ran around a belt line of William, East, Archer and Canning Street with routes extending out to the Rockhampton Showgrounds in Wandal, the South Rockhampton Cemetery in Allenstown and up to the Rockhampton Botanic Gardens on The Range. The gauge of the track was 1067mm (3 ft 6in). Throughout the three decades in which the trams ran, the service struggled to be financially viable particularly when it faced competition from a new bus service in the 1920s.

The 18‚Äì35-year-old group of the Rockhampton branch of the National Trust of Australia began searching for parts of the original steam trams to reconstruct a new Purrey steam tram at the old Canning Street tram depot, in time for the Australian Bicentenary celebrations in 1988.McCarthy, K. A.; Triumph In The North: The Recommissioning of the Rockhampton Purrey Steam Car, Trolley Wire, No. 234, 18 August 1988. Accessed from Sydney Tramway Museum website 2 April 2018. From 1982, Rockhampton City Council coordinated the restoration project, using grants made available to the Bicentennial Scheme and officially launched the project in June 1984 at a ball to mark 75 years of council-operated public transport in Rockhampton. Although various parts of the original trams were successfully relocated including the collapsed body of one of the old trams, other parts were sourced from elsewhere including the steam engine unit from the Antique Machinery Society in Brisbane, and a Purrey boiler steam feedwater pump from the Ipswich railway workshops. Two public open days were held during the steam tram's reconstruction which attracted large crowds. Following some setbacks, the tram was successfully completed on 10 May 1988 at a cost of $212,000. On 5 June 1988, Rockhampton mayor Jim Webber officially declared the steam tram restoration complete, exactly 79 years since William Kidston had declared the city's first tram service open on 5 June 1909. Following the official ceremony, the tram commenced one-way trips along the Denison Street railway line between Stanley Street and Fitzroy Street for a cost of $1 per trip. The tram carried 2,600 passengers between 9:30 am and 4:30 pm. Tourist attraction During the official ceremony at the 1988 event, the general manager of local newspaper The Morning Bulletin Mike McCarthy presented a $20,000 cheque to Mayor Jim Webber to put towards constructing and establishing a permanent tourist tram route in Rockhampton. Trolley Wire reported at the time that there were two schools of thought on how the newly built Purrey steam tram could be used as a local tourist attraction. One proposal was for the tram to run along the old railway wharf branch line down Stanley Street and then run along Quay Street parallel to the Fitzroy River past the heritage-listed buildings in the CBD. The second proposal involved the tram running from the tourist information centre in Lower Dawson Road, then skirt the Yeppen Yeppen Lagoon before terminating at the Rockhampton Botanic Gardens. It was reported the Yeppen Yeppen Lagoon proposal was the one Rockhampton City Council favoured the most. However, the Purrey steam tram ultimately found its new home at the old Archer Park Railway Station which was handed over to Rockhampton City Council by Queensland Rail in 1990, for the purpose of transforming it into a museum. The reconstructed tram is still housed at the Archer Park Rail Museum and operates as a tourist attraction for several hours each Sunday on 1.1 kilometres of isolated tram track between Albert Street and Fitzroy Street which runs parallel to the main line on Denison Street. The restored tram is believed to be the last operational Purrey Steam Tram in the world.Restored Purrey Steam Tram (PDF), The Friends of Archer Park Rail Museum, Qld Rail Heritage website.

It incorporates the city's seal, name, and motto on a gold, white, and blue field. The field is designed to be reminiscent of a beach. Each of the colors also have their own meaning, the gold represents the sand on the beach, the white represents the city's clean air, and the blue represents the Pacific Ocean. History =Former flag (1948‚Äì1967)= In 1948, Corporal Eugenia McGrath of the Long Beach Lancerettes, a semi-military mounted troop of female lancers, designed the first city flag of Long Beach. A physical form of the flag was made by Captain Arvery Lehman and was flown by the Lancerettes in city parades. =Current flag (1967‚Äìpresent)= By 1956, the city of Long Beach had begun to consider adopting a new flag. The city assigned three city officials, Fielding C. Combs, the director of public relations, Edwin Castagna, the city librarian, and Jerome Donson, the municipal art director, with making the new flag and called for it to have the city seal on it. Later on, per the request of the public relations committee, the city council invited organizations to submit flag designs as well. By 1958, the need to adopt a new city flag had become a more urgent issue. The three officials originally tasked with designing the new flag later came to the conclusion that the seal was too complicated to be on a flag and Combs suggested that citizens should send in proposals. The city held several flag design contests in the early 1960s but none of the proposals were accepted. One person later suggested that the city flag should be based on the flag of the Port of Long Beach, which was designed in 1964 by Al Maddy, the port's Director of Administration. A city flag derived from Maddy's design ended up being adopted by the city council on July 5, 1967. =Vietnam War= During the Vietnam War in late 1967, shortly after the city of Long Beach had adopted its current flag, Lance Corporal Steven Radford, a resident of Long Beach, received a copy of the Press-Telegram from his parents, Ernest and Hazel. After reading in the paper that the city had recently adopted a new flag, he decided that he wanted one to remind him of his hometown and sent a letter to the Long Beach City College's Volksen Club requesting one. The club responded to his request by presenting a flag to his parents to send to him. By the time Radford was sent the flag, he was recovering from an injury aboard the USS Sanctuary. On Christmas Day of 1968, the flag of Long Beach was added to the USS New Jersey, a Long Beach-based battleship which was deployed in the Gulf of Tonkin during the Vietnam War. It was placed on the quarterdeck of the ship alongside the flag of the United States and the flag of New Jersey. =Boy Scouts of America= For the 1969 National Scout Jamboree in Farragut State Park, Idaho, the Long Beach branch of the Boy Scouts of America brought a city flag to accompany them. =Rose Parade= For the 1973 Rose Parade, the Long Beach Mounted Police, serving as the parade's color guard, carried the city flag as well as the mounted police banner and 26 American flags. =2004 North American Vexillological Association survey= In 2004, the North American Vexillological Association held a survey where it ranked 150 American city flags based on the quality of their designs. The flag of Long Beach placed 90th, receiving a score of 3.70 out of 10.

After a 2004 incident, he was detained on the grounds of 8 U.S.C. 1226, which states that under a warrant by the Attorney General immigrants may be arrested and detained while their case status is decided.

The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed his entry deciding detained immigrants had the right to a periodic hearing if one had not already been held after 6 months. The Court of Appeal's decision was reversed by the Supreme Court in a plurality opinion after granting a writ of certiorari in June 2016.

The work is divided into 6 chapters, the first 5 of them having a similar extension and being called Quaderns (Catalan word for Notebooks) and the last of them being short and entitled ¬´√âs l'Alba la mare de la humanitat actual?¬ª (Is Alba the mother of current humanity?). The novel was published in English in 2017 by Wesleyan University Press. It was brought to television by a very successful TV series produced and displayed by TV3, and in 2015 it was adapted for the big screen with the film Segon origen.  Plot  In this novel de Pedrolo tells the story of Alba and D√≠dac, 14 and 9 years old respectively, who live in a Catalan town called Benaura. They become the only survivors on Earth after extraterrestrials destroy almost all humanity. Before the invasion, D√≠dac is attacked by some neb from the town because he is black. He falls into the water, and Alba, who sees the scene, jumps in to save him. Being under the water protects them from destruction. During the following four years, they survive in a destroyed world and face many and varied troubles and difficulties that make them mature quickly. They realise the importance of knowledge by keeping and reading books. They run away from the pestilence and take refuge in a farmhouse, where they find dead people and survivors. They walk by the ruins of Barcelona and the Mediterranean Sea. They learn from everything that happens to them (illnesses, enemy defense) and from the information they collect. The book explores the relationship between the two children and the recreation of a world as a utopia. The narration is structured in chapters that always start the same way: by mentioning Alba's age and her virginity. The narrator is omniscient and uses much description.  Translations  The novel has been translated to Spanish (1984), to Dutch (1986), to Basque (1989), to Galician (1989), to French (1993), to Romanian (2000), to Portuguese (2004) and to Italian (2011). In November 2016, the Council of Lleida financed the first translation into English, which was published in the United States in 2017.

The company was founded by Carlos Nicholas Fernandes in 2007 and previously offered services as RecordTV.com.  History  RecordTV.com was originally a US-based company that provided cloud- based recording of any and all cable TV channels its founder, David Simon, had subscribed to, by any user on the Internet. The MPAA sued Simon for copyright infringement. Simon initially hired Ira Rothken to defend against the litigation, but eventually gave up, settled and decided to sell its assets. = Launch in Singapore = Fernandes purchased the assets of RecordTV.com from Simon, but then invented (and patented) \\"A System and Method for recording television and/or radio programmes via the Internet\\". Among other things, the RecordTV.com service was restricted to Singapore users alone and users were able to record only Singapore Free-to-Air content, which was broadcast by Singapore's state-owned broadcaster, MediaCorp. Shortly thereafter, on 24 July 2017 and 27 September 2017, RecordTV.com received two cease and desist letters alleging infringement by MediaCorp. = RecordTV Pte Ltd vs. MediaCorp litigation = RecordTV Pte Ltd refused to comply with the demand to shut down its website. After the first cease and desist letter from MediaCorp, RecordTV's lawyers wrote back, alleging that MediaCorp's move was \\"calculated to stifle innovation and the growth of a new industry\\" according to an article by Singapore Press Holdings that was republished. After the second, September cease and desist letter was received, RecordTV preemptively sued MediaCorp for groundless threats of copyright infringement proceedings, claimed S$30.5 million in damages and continued to operate its website. One of the core legal issues that arose was whether RecordTV.com was recording content on behalf of its users or whether the users were using RecordTV.com to record TV shows they would otherwise be entitled to see. This was significant because the case would turn on the identity of the party making the copy ‚Äì if it was the consumer, it could be considered for time-shifting and domestic use and therefore legal. If it was the company, then, the company was recording it for commercial use and therefore illegal. Thus, the case would turn based on the identity of the party making the copy. MediaCorp was represented by Drew and Napier CEO and Senior Counsel Davinder Singh, who cross-examined RecordTV CEO Fernandes over 3.5 days during the trial. RecordTV lost the lawsuit in the High Court of Singapore. In the initial, adverse judgment against RecordTV, Justice Ang of the High Court cited copyright law specialist William Patry. Following the judgment, Patry stated that in his view Justice Ang had erred in a blog post called the \\"Singaporean Cablevision case\\", where he asserted that the court had misread the Cablevision ruling and should have found in favour or RecordTV. David Post, a legal scholar and co-author of an amicus curiae brief in support of Cablevision, also indicated through his writings that the court should have found in favour of RecordTV. RecordTV chose to appeal the ruling. In its ruling, at the onset, the Court of Appeals set out the importance of the case for society: :This appeal raises an important policy issue as to how the courts should interpret copyright legislation in the light of technological advances which have clear legitimate and beneficial uses for the public, but which may be circumscribed or stymied by expansive claims of existing copyright owners. Bearing in mind that the law strives to encourage both creativity and innovation for the common good, in a case such as the present one, how should the courts strike a just and fair balance between the interests of all affected stakeholders, viz, consumers, content providers as well as technology and service vendors? If the law is not clear as to whether the use of improved technology which is beneficial to society constitutes a breach of copyright, should the courts interpret legislative provisions to favour the private rights of the copyright owner or the public‚Äôs wider interests? This is the problem that we face and have to resolve in the present case. In the normal course of events, when enacting a statute, the Legislature balances the rights and interests of all affected stakeholders after considering the social costs and the economic implications. Where the statute is not clear, however, the courts have to perform this difficult task. The Court of Appeals ruled in favour of RecordTV, awarded costs and damages and issued an injunction against MediaCorp from issuing further threats against RecordTV. In reversing the ruling of the lower court, the Court of Appeals summarised its conclusion: :To summarise our observations: in the present case, RecordTV‚Äôs iDVR service represents a significant technological improvement over existing recording methods and facilitates the more convenient enjoyment of television viewing rights by those Registered Users living in Singapore who hold valid television licences. RecordTV‚Äôs iDVR is simply a technological advance that is not addressed by the Copyright Act in the context of the copyright owner‚Äôs exclusive right to copy (ie, reproduce), communicate to the public and authorise the copying and/or the communication to the public of copyright-protected material. Since RecordTV was doing no more than making it more convenient for the aforesaid Registered Users to enjoy the MediaCorp shows (which was something that these Registered Users were entitled to do as MediaCorp had licensed them to view those shows), we are of the view that the public interest is better served by encouraging rather than stifling the use of RecordTV‚Äôs novel technology, especially given that MediaCorp has apparently not suffered any loss from RecordTV‚Äôs provision of an additional and better time-shifting service to Registered Users who are licensed to view the MediaCorp shows. Following the victory, ZDNET quoted Fernandes as saying, :\\"We are delighted by the ruling. After over three years of litigation, it is clear that MediaCorp's threats were unjustified. Today is a great day for entrepreneurs, consumers and innovators.\\" The litigation was described as a \\"David vs. Goliath\\" battle that came to \\"its familiar conclusion\\", on the front page of the Business Times newspaper. Fernandes was subsequently namedhttp://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_YGL_ActiveMembers.pdf Young Global Leader by the World Economic Forum. =Relaunch= As a result of the initial adverse ruling in the High Court, RecordTV had shut down its website. Following the reversal by the Court of Appeals, RecordTV relaunched the website. In October 2014, RecordTV launched an app called InstantTV that targeted the global market, including free channels for Thailand, Japan, Indonesia, United States and United Kingdom markets. The facility to record and play Singapore channels persisted, although it continued to be geographically restricted to Singapore IP addresses. The InstantTV app on the Android Play Store went from 10,000 installs on 4 November 2014 to 100,000 installs - a 1000% increase by 3 August 2015, in 7 months.

Early years (1902‚Äì1942) The club was founded on 12 March 1902, initially being known as \\"Egyet√©rt√©s Futball Club\\" but on becoming independent it was renamed \\"Debreceni Vasutas Sport Club\\" (Debrecen Railway Sports Club). In 1926 professionalism came to the Hungarian football scene, with the unfortunate result that Bocskai FC was formed using players from DVSC and city rivals DKASE and DTE, with the result that Bocskai FC ruled the football roost in Debrecen for 15 years while DVSC continued to struggle in the lower divisions. In 1940 the professional/amateur division of players was abolished and Bocskai FC suffered financial collapse, returning DVSC to top- dog position in the city. Debrecen reached the Hungarian First Division for the first time in 1942‚Äì43, but then suffered something of a yo-yo existence for the next fifty years, suffering eight relegations in all, and even starting the 1967 season in the Third Division. During this period the club underwent a number of name changes. It became \\"Debreceni Vasutas Sport Egyes√ºlet\\" in 1948‚Äì49, \\"Debreceni Lokomotiv\\" (hence the nickname) in 1949, \\"Debreceni T√∂rekv√©s\\" in the 1955‚Äì56 season, and it was known as \\"Debreceni Vasutas SC\\" from 1957 to 1979.

A Shia nobleman from Persia known as Sakhi Salamat of Isfahan settled in the village of Prithimpassa, Kulaura in 1499. His son, Ismail Khan Lodhi was later on given the status of Nawab. =Mughal era= From 1717 until 1880, all three successive Nawab dynasties ‚Äì the Nasiri, Afshar and Najafi ‚Äì ruled what was then known as Bengal. The first dynasty, the Nasiri, ruled from 1717 until 1740. The founder of the Nasiri, Murshid Quli Khan, was born a poor Deccani Odia Brahmin before being sold into slavery and bought by Haji Shafi Isfahani, a Persian merchant from Isfahan who converted him to Shia Islam. He entered the service of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb and rose through the ranks before becoming the Nawab Nizam of Bengal in 1717, a post he held until his death in 1727. He in turn was succeeded by his son-in-law, Shuja-ud-Din Muhammad Khan. After Shuja-ud-Din's death in 1739 he was succeeded by his son, Sarfaraz Khan, who held the rank, until he was killed in the Battle of Giria in 1741, and was succeeded by Alivardi Khan, former ruler of Patna, of the Afshar Dynasty in 1740. The second dynasty, the Afshar, ruled from 1740 to 1757 starting with Alivardi Khan. Siraj ud-Daulah, the last Afshar Nawab was killed in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 by the British Empire They were succeeded by the third and final dynasty to rule the whole Bengal, the Najafi. The first Najafi Nawab was Mir Jafar in June 1757 and the post was abolished in November 1880 with Mansur Ali Khan as the final Nawab of Bengal. In 1799, Agha Muhammad Reza, a Mughal Shia nobleman in Sylhet of Iranian origin rebelled against the East India Company. Gaining support from thousands of peasants after claiming to be a Sufi saint, Reza successfully invaded the nearby Kachari Kingdom. Later proclaiming himself as the Mahdi (promised messiah) and twelfth imam, he was captured and imprisoned in Calcutta. = Pakistan era = Political influence Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the Quaid-e-Azam (\\"the Great Leader\\"), the founder of the state of Pakistan, was born into an Ismaili Shia family although later in life he followed Twelver Shia Islam. = Modern era = There is a very small minority of Sylheti Shias who gather every year during Ashura for the Mourning of Muharram processions in places such as Prithimpasha Nawab Bari in Kulaura, home to a Shia family, as well as Balaganj, Osmani Nagar and Rajtila.

Lawn had a brief career in politics, working for a congressman and the 1968 Eugene McCarthy presidential campaign before entering journalism. She reported from Washington for several international clients and was appointed an honorary Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2012 in recognition of her work. At the time of her death she was the longest-serving White House correspondent. Early life Of Russian Jewish descent, Lawn was born in New Jersey to Howard Martin Lawn (1911‚Äì2000), a businessman who was president of Parkmobile Inc., and the Equity and Capital Company, and Pearl H. Bergman (1913‚Äì1989), a chemist and homemaker. Both her parents were staunch Democrats. Her paternal grandfather, Sal Simon Lawn (1884‚Äì1969), was a Republican, who served as sergeant-at-arms for the Second Judicial Court and was a veteran of World War I. Lawn was raised with her brother, Richard, and elder sister, Margo Rose (1940‚Äì1981). She was the first and only girl to play for the Long Branch Little League in 1956. In 1962, Lawn graduated from Long Branch High School, and went on to receive a bachelor's degree in political science from Simmons College in 1966; she later moved to Washington, D.C. She was also a graduate of the L'In stitut d'Etudes Politiques in Paris. Political and reporting career Lawn briefly worked for a U.S. congressman and served as a volunteer for Eugene McCarthy's 1968 presidential campaign before becoming a reporter for a news station in Washington, D.C. She spent her career as an unaffiliated journalist, unlike many of her fellow White House correspondents, and was the founder and sole employee of Audio Video News. She reported for several clients in the United States and around the world. Her international radio clients included networks in the UK, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Israel, and South Africa. In the 2012 New Year Honours, she was appointed an honorary Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in recognition of her services to New Zealand‚ÄìUnited States relations. This included writing articles for the US market promoting tourism to New Zealand and its ski resorts. Lawn also received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the National Press Club of New Zealand and had a champion race-horse named after her in that country. Lawn covered Robert F. Kennedy's 1968 presidential campaign, travelling with him across the United States. She conducted one of the last interviews with Kennedy before his assassination in Los Angeles on June 5 of that year. Later that year, whilst reporting on the riots and protests around the 1968 Democratic National Convention, Lawn was beaten by Chicago police officers. She covered the 1968 Soviet Invasion of Czechoslovakia from Prague, the Watergate scandal of 1972, and the attempted assassination of Ronald Reagan in 1981. At around the time of the 1982 Lebanon War, Lawn avoided an attempted abduction in Lebanon by hitting her attacker in the face with a bag and escaping to Israeli soldiers. At the time of her death Lawn was the longest-serving White House correspondent. She attended her last press briefing on December 14, 2017, a few months before her death. Personal life Lawn's first marriage was in November 1973 to Stephen Rappaport, a certified public accountant. They had two sons; their marriage later ended in a divorce. She married Charles A. Sneiderman in 2000. She was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in 2011, and died on April 2, 2018, aged 73, in Falls Church, Virginia. In addition to her husband, she is survived by a brother, Richard Lawn; two sons from her first marriage, Daniel and David Rappaport; and two grandchildren.

He was heavily involved in the development of Australia's telegraphy and telephony networks. Nelson is notable for assisting with one of the earliest wireless telegraphy experiments in Australia. Professional career On 29 May 1886, Nelson was promoted from 2nd Class Operator to Continental Check Clerk in the Electric Telegraph Department within the General Post Office. His associate Alfred Dircks was concurrently promoted into the position he vacated. On 2 December 1889 he was promoted from Continental Clerk to Inspector of Telegraph Lines and Stations for the Northern District in the General Post Office. Again, on 16 October 1890, he was promoted from Inspector of Telegraph Lines and Stations, to be Electrician at the General Post Office. At the same time his colleague Edward William Bramble, was promoted from Senior Telegraph Operator to be Inspector of Telegraph Lines and Stations, in his stead. Following upon the death of his superior Philip Billingsley Walker, the single role of Chief Electrician and Engineer-in-Chief of Telegraphs was split into two positions on 10 September 1900. Nelson was promoted into the Chief Electrician position and his colleague William Wilson into Manager, Telegraph Branch. Nelson's retirement was gazetted on 4 May 1916. On 26 May 1899, Nelson was appointed to the committee empowered to carry out examinations in connection with the testing of Post and Telegraph Masters, Operators, and Assistants, in the Postal and Electric Telegraph Department, with view to promotion. His superior Philip Billingsley Walker was also part of the committee. =Wireless experiments= The announcement of successful wireless telegraphy experiments at the Sydney General Post Office by Philip Billingsley Walker, Watkin Wynne and John Yeates Nelson was very widely reported around Australia and, despite the relatively short distance involved, represented a major step forward for the Colony of New South Wales. The Sydney Daily Telegraph of 11 August 1899 comprehensively reported on the experiments of 10 August as follows: > \\"WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY. EXHIBITION AT THE GENERAL POST-OFFICE. MORSE SIGNALS > ON TAPE. Yesterday, at the top of the General Post-office building, an > exhibition of wireless telegraphy was given by Mr. P. B. Walker, chief > electrician and engineer-in-chief of the Postal Department. Ten feet copper > wires were run from the sending and receiving instruments respectively, at > either end of the building, each wire as it branched out into space being > bright and slightly curved ‚Äî in fact, the two wires might be said to point > at one another, the Hertzian waves passing through the air, as in Marconi's > experiments. When the apparatus had been set in position, the following > message was sent to Mr. Watkin Wynne, who was at the receiving end:‚Äî \\"Mr. > Walker is glad to announce wireless telegraphy as accomplished.\\" Mr. Walker > operated the ordinary Morse key himself, and the arrangements were perfect > enough to bring the signals out in ink on a tape. The apparatus used > consisted principally of a large 12in. spark induction coil, capable of > radiating through space electric waves of very high pressure, and of a > receiver, called a \\"coherer.\\" The entire success of the experiments depends > upon the arrangement of the latter, which consists of a small glass tube > about 2in. long, into which two small plugs of silver are tightly fitted and > separated from one another by about one-thirtieth of an inch. The space > between these plugs is filled with a mixture of very fine iron filings of > nickel and silver. The action of the electric waves, as radiated by means of > the induction coil, causes these filings to cohere, and there-by makes an > electric contact between the two silver plugs. The latter were for the > purpose of the experiment connected with an ordinary telegraph (Morse) > recording apparatus, and during the exhibition responded to every impulse > radiated by the transmitter. The latter was, of course, controlled by an > ordinary Morse key, the arrangement being that long and short streams of > electric waves were sent out just as dots and dashes are used in the > ordinary everyday working of land and cable wires, although, of course, the > speed of the key has necessarily to be curtailed. All the instruments used > were manufactured by the Government electricians under Mr. Walker's > direction, Mr. Nelson being entrusted with the operation. Two months were > occupied in their construction, and experiments have been going on during > the past three weeks. The Postmaster-General recently placed ¬£150 on the > Estimates in order to obtain the necessary Marconi instruments. The latter > are expected to arrive in the colony in about a month or six weeks, and upon > their arrival it is intended to carry out experiments similar to those > effected in Europe, and especially with the object of ascertaining whether > our atmospheric conditions in any way influence the working of the > machines.\\" Nelson's knowledge of wireless telegraphy was well developed and reflected personal interest as much as professional necessity. In a well crafted article over his signature for Sydney's Daily Telegraph newspaper of 2 January 1901, he neatly summarised developments in the field of wireless telegraphy over the last decade in a manner which still reads well today. The overview provided gives appropriate credit to Marconi's advances while noting advances by other experimenters in the field. This position aligns closely with that of postal officials in Great Britain and Australia, already wary of possible monopolization of the technology by Marconi. Military career Throughout his working life, Nelson participated in various capacities in the Auxiliary forces of the Colony of New South Wales and subsequent to Federation, that of the Commonwealth of Australia. On 17 October 1902 he was awarded the \\"Colonial Auxiliary Forces Officers' Decoration\\" and at that time he was ranked as Major, Director of Military Telegraphs. Personal life Nelson was an accomplished rower in younger days. He was an active member of the Mercantile Rowing Club. He was frequently a committee member of the club. When the Telegraph Department commenced their annual regattas from 1880, Nelson was both an official and rower. From the late 1880s it seems other interests had overtaken rowing. On 23 June 1913, Nelson had been appointed Commissioner for Declarations under the Statutory Declarations Act 1911. This was a common practice for senior public servants to assist in the performance of their duties. Following his retirement, the appointment was withdrawn on 13 March 1917. Late life and legacy Nelson suffered a serious illness in 1911 causing him to take leave for several months. While he gave every appearance of having fully recovered, his health was clearly impaired somewhat. He chose to retire in 1916 after 49 years of public service, rather than the more usual period of 50 years as was the custom at the time. Nelson appears to have led a quiet life in retirement, for there are few newspaper reports of his activities subsequently.

He was ordained to the priesthood in 1908 and served as a parish priest in various churches across Brazil but was noted for his extensive work at the San Antonio church in Tamba√∫ where he lived most of his life. He was famed for his reported miracles and other wonders that began around the 1920s and continued until his death. But this drew some consternation from the local bishop in 1955 who ordered him to give one final blessing to the public and then to retreat to normal parish duties with no more talk of miracles or healings. He did so in obedience and continued to exercise his functions as a parish priest until his death. The priest had been hailed as a saint his entire life and efforts to launch a beatification process started in 1991. The cause opened towards the decade's end and he became titled as a Servant of God. Pope Francis confirmed his heroic virtue on 9 October 2017 and named him as Venerable. Francis also signed a decree on 6 April 2019 that recognized a miracle attributed to his intercession which made it possible for him to be beatified in Tamba√∫ on 23 November 2019. Life =Childhood and education= Donizetti Tavares de Lima was born in 1882 in Minas Gerais to Trist√£o and Francisca C√¢ndida Tavares de Lima; he had eight brothers. His father worked in law and his mother worked as a professor. In his childhood in 1886 the Tavares de Limas relocated to Franca in S√£o Paulo where he attended school and learned music. In 1894 he commenced his ecclesial studies where he soon became the organist at the institute where he studied and later started to teach music to the seminarians; he had asked his father for permission to become a priest. In 1897 he moved to a college to further his education but later returned to teach music to seminarians. In 1900 he commenced a law course and in 1903 commenced his philosophical and theological formation in preparation for the priesthood. =Priesthood= He received his ordination as a priest on 12 July 1908 from the Bishop of Pouso Alegre and was incardinated into the Pouso Alegre diocese. He began work in the San Gaetano parish and then spent time in the Campinas diocese where he served as a vicar. In 1909 he was appointed as the parish priest for the Sant'Ana church Vargem Grande do Sul in the Ribeir√£o Preto diocese where he defended the rights of the poor. This staunch advocacy for the poor led to the rich and his other detractors to accuse him of being a communist. He also helped construct chapels to Nossa Senhora Aparecida and to Saint Benedict of Nursia. He was stationed at the Sant'Ana church from 20 April to 8 August 1909 before being transferred once again. On 24 May 1926 he was appointed as the newest parish priest for the church of San Antonio in Tamba√∫. He arrived in the town on 12 June and was inaugurated at the parish with his first Mass there on 13 June. It was there that he oversaw the establishment of the Saint Vincent de Paul sanatorium for the abandoned and for elderly people who lived alone. The first \\"miracle\\" attributed to him was said to have occurred in 1927: torrential rain threatened a procession of a statue of Nossa Senhora Aparecida but the storm subsided and was quieted when Tavares de Lima led the procession himself. In 1955 the local bishop grew concerned with the number of people reporting miracles attributed to him and the fanaticism associated with him. Tavares de Lima himself took the chance to stamp out this fanaticism but the bishop decided to put an end to pilgrimages to the famed priest and requested he continue his functions as a parish priest and speak no more of these rumors of healings. On 30 May 1955 ‚Äì upon the bishop's orders ‚Äì he gave his last public blessing to the crowds gathered outside of the church. Airplanes flew overhead and poured a shower of rose petals down to the ground to mark the occasion. In 1960 the Archbishop of Ribeir√£o Preto and the priest Agmar de Paula Marques went to visit him in his parish. The moment the priest saw the pair he told the archbishop of a terrible nightmare he had of a demon appearing when the altar of the church was removed and how the church's namesake repelled it. The archbishop assured him that it was just a nightmare but Tavares de Lima insisted a darkness was growing. The archbishop then reassured him that he would not allow such a thing to pass. Local officials came to him to seek out his advice despite their initial reluctance to do so and asked him for advice on social matters. Even President Get√∫lio Vargas spoke with Tavares de Lima about social matters that culminated in the 1954 legislation governing proper work ethics. Tavares de Lima received a picture of Pope John XXIII in 1959. Father Saverio Brugnara recounted that the priest looked at the image and said that both needed to appeal to God's intercession for both the pope and the Church itself in light of the fact that the Second Vatican Council had been convoked. One of those present in the room wanted to remove the image of Pope Pius XII to place the new one up but Tavares de Lima said to leave the image on the wall as it was for \\"soon I will meet him!\\" The journalist Joelmir Beting once said on a radio program that at Easter in 1953 the priest celebrated Mass at 12:00 pm in the church for people but was seen at that exact time in S√£o Pedro dos Morrinhos at an auction of cattle to help raise funds for his sanatorium. The 1955 healing of Jos√© Alexandre Braga (b. 1950) from osteochondritis was also attributed to him. Tavares de Lima shrugged the miracles off as unimportant but placed great emphasis on the conversions of spirit such healings fostered. He led an austere life dedicated to material and spiritual poverty, following his desire to live like the poor did. He slept on a wooden board rather than a bed and ate okra soup at dinner which was his sole meal. His residence was also devoid of furniture and he had one cassock that he repaired himself on numerous occasions rather than getting new ones. He donated material things that his parishioners gave him to the poor rather than use them for himself. He also could read hearts in confession which enabled him to see the penitent better but could cause upset to some who sought him in the confessional. In 1958 during the celebrations of Holy Week he celebrated a Mass outside the San Antonio church and made an address. But he began levitating from the ground without having realized what was happening to the great awe of the gathered crowds. =Death= Tavares de Lima died in Tamba√∫ on 16 June 1961 due to cardiac complications and diabetic complications that had caused several hospitalizations in the past. He died in the morning at 11:15 am while seated in a chair. His remains were interred on 17 June; his remains were exhumed on 7‚Äì8 May 2009 in Tamba√∫ for canonical inspection and relocation which was done at night to avoid a large crowd forming. His remains were later moved to his old parish church on 16 May and now attract between 10 and 12 thousand people per month who come as pilgrims. Beatification The beatification process opened under Pope John Paul II on 2 December 1996 after the Congregation for the Causes of Saints titled Tavares de Lima as a Servant of God and declared \\"nihil obstat\\" (no objections) to the cause which had been requested since 1991. The diocesan process was overseen in collecting documentation and witness testimonies in S√£o Jo√£o de Boa Vista from 16 March 1997 until just over a decade later on 16 May 2009. On 3 June 2009 the documentation collected was transferred to the C.C.S. in Rome who later validated the process on 29 October 2010. On 21 January 2011 the Benedictine priest Alfredo Sim√≥n was appointed as the cause's relator who would help the postulator in drafting the Positio dossier. On 6 May 2013 the dossier was submitted to the C.C.S. for assessment. Tavares de Lima became titled as Venerable on 9 October 2017 after Pope Francis confirmed that he had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue in accordance with the cardinal and theological virtues. On 19 March 2018 the bishop Antonio Vilar met with the C.C.S. prefect Cardinal Angelo Amato who assured the bishop that medical experts had confirmed that a healing presented for Tavares de Lima's potential beatification was a miracle and that theologians would soon assess it. Pope Francis ‚Äì on 6 April 2019 ‚Äì signed a decree acknowledging this miracle which therefore enabled for him to be beatified in Tamba√∫ on 23 November 2019. The current postulator for this cause is Dr. Paolo Vilotta.

Biography  Ribonnier was probably from LangresTh√©odore Pistollet de Saint- Ferjeux, Le ch√¢teau et les seigneurs du Pailly, in M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© historique et arch√©ologique de Langres, 1847, volume 1, Read online but no documents were found to confirm it. A Jean Ribonnier priest of Heuilley-le- Grand has been found. If he was from his family, his Langrois origin would be fortified. If he worked on the rood screen of the cath√©drale Saint-Mamm√®s de Langres, this implies that he lived in Langres around 1550. He is quoted as godfather in an act of the parish of Saint-Pierre de Langres, on l8 January 1560. In a royal letter of 1564 registered at the Chamber of Accounts of Dijon, it is written Nicolas Ribonier, ma√ßon en nostre ville de Dijon is endowed with the office of visiteur des ouvrages des places fortes, villes et chasteaulx de notre pays de Bourgogne, a position vacant following the death of Jean de Vaulx. Between 1560 and 1605, his name appears several times in the inventory of the municipal archives of Langres. He was not a member of the City Body, but before 1572 he was a member of the Confr√©rie du Saint- Sacrement. He was also a member of the brotherhood of Saint-Pierre and Saint- Paul in 1604. It is in the register of this brotherhood that we learn the year of his death: 1605. * in 1588, he traced the boulevard de Longe-Porte, * in December 1590, he was paid for work done at Porte Neufve, * In March 1591, he made a commitment to the mayor and aldermen to build a drawbridge at the Market gate and to dig a ditch to avoid surprises, * in October, he fixed the Moulins' gate, * In 1594, he rebuilt a wall between the gate of Longe-Porte and the Saint-Gengoul tower, and built a half-moon platform behind the Saint- Ferjeux tower, * in 1596, he repaired the entire city walls, * In 1595/1596, he and were charged with demolishing the castle of MontsaugeonCh√¢teau de Montsaugeon which had been used to threaten Langres. He married Jeanne de Voisines and had seven children. His wife belonged to a well-established family in Langres. We know a Jean de Voisines, secretary of the bishopric, then canon from 1555 to 1563. In 1563, a Nicolas de Voisines appears as a mason on a register of the brotherhood of Saint-Pierre and Saint-Paul. Another Jean de Voisines, master builder, commanded the artillery of the Langrois at the siege of Choiseul. He is qualified as master general of the works of the Duchy of Burgundy in 1570, magister lathomus, master mason in 1587, master architect at the Court of Accounts of the Duchy of Burgundy in 1591, architect in 1593. On May 16, 1593, the corporation of the masons of Langres, of which Nicolas Ribonnier was a member, modified its statutes, allowing it to become a nursery of architects.Louis Marcel, Une page de l'histoire du b√¢timent √† Langres au XVIIIe si√®cle, in Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© historique et arch√©ologique de Langres, April 1922, , note Read online Residing in Dijon in 1564, he also worked with Hugues Sambin at the Dijon courthouse.Paul Vitry, Le ch√¢teau du Pailly, in Congr√®s arch√©ologique de France. 91th session. Dijon. 1928, , Paris, 1929, Read online He made the porch of the Dijon courthouse which precedes the gabled facade., L'architecture de la Renaissance, Alcide Picard & Kaan publishers, Paris, Read online In 1563, Gaspard de Saulx- Tavannes undertook to build a new castle within the walls of the old located two leagues from Langres, while retaining the keep. Nicolas Ribonnier, qualified as architect of the Duchy of Burgundy, is considered as the probable architect of this new castle. The sculptors used to make the castle, were probably Italian sculptors who had been called by the cardinal de Givry. After the construction of the Ch√¢teau du Pailly, Gaspard de Saulx asked Ribonnier in 1573 for plans to rebuild the Ch√¢teau de Sully. Gaspard du Saulx died shortly after designing the plans with his architect. They were executed by his wife, Fran√ßoise de La Baume-Montrevel. According to , viscount of Tavannes, the castle was finished in 1620, but only the main fa√ßade received a decoration.

The village is now part of the civil parish of Ashchurch Rural.  History  The village is mentioned as plain Walton in the Domesday Book of 1086. The name is of Old English origin, and means \\"wall settlement\\", probably referring to the enclosure around the site of the manor house at the southern end of the village. In 1166 the manor was owned by William of Cardiff, and the manor remained in the Cardiff family until the late 14th century. In the middle ages the manor formed part of the parish of Tewkesbury, but in the 17th century Walton Cardiff became a separate parish. The parish extended to the River Swilgate in the west, and to the main road running east from Tewkesbury (now the A46) in the north. The parish became a civil parish in 1866. In 1935, the area north of Tirle Brook was transferred to Tewkesbury parish, and was later developed as part of the district of Newtown. In the 1990s a large area in the western part of the parish was developed as the Wheatpieces estate. In 2008 that part of the parish was separated to form the new civil parish of Wheatpieces. The remainder of the civil parish of Walton Cardiff was abolished and became part of the parish of Ashchurch Rural.The Tewkesbury (Parishes) Order 2007  References   External links  Category:Villages in Gloucestershire Category:Borough of Tewkesbury Category:Former civil parishes in Gloucestershire ","title":"Walton Cardiff"},{"id":"57018827","text":"Dawn Therese Rasmussen is a retired athlete and sports administrator from Samoa.

A member of the French Resistance during the Second World War, she was the wife of journalist and politician Pierre Brossolette (1903-1944), who committed suicide while being tortured by the Gestapo. Early life and wartime She was born at 24 rue Vaneau in Paris, the daughter of a bank manager, Gilbert Bruel, and his wife, Marie-Th√®rese Deromas. She obtained her baccalaureat from the Institut Sainte-Clotilde in Paris; afterwards, she received a diploma from the Sorbonne and began working as a journalist, employed by papers such as Marianne and Le Populaire. On 20 July 1926 she married Pierre Brossolette, who was three years older than her, and they had two children, Anne and Claude; the latter became a high-ranking civil servant. In 1940, after the fall of France, the couple began holding secret meetings at their home with a view to setting up a Resistance movement. They set up a Russian bookshop at 89 rue de la Pompe, and this became a centre for the Resistance. In 1942, after their teenage son had been taken in for questioning by the Gestapo, they tried to escape to London, with Gilberte and the children travelling by felucca to Gibraltar and thence to the UK. There she worked for the BBC and for the Commissariat √† l'Int√©rieur de la France libre. Post-war and politics In 1946, nominated by the SFIO (French Section of the Workers' International), she was one of 21 women elected to the new Conseil de la R√©publique that formed the interim government of France. She later complained that it was difficult for her to speak up for women's rights because her position as Brossolette's widow gave her a different status. She was Vice-President of the Council of the Republic (which replaced the Senate in the Fourth Republic). She continued as a senator until 1959. Gilberte's biography of her husband, titled Il s‚Äôappelait Pierre Brossolette, was first published in 1976. She died, aged 98, at Fontainebleau. In the 2015 television film Pierre Brossolette ou les passagers de la lune, the role of Gilberte was played by L√©a Drucker.

Stone & Co was a British marine and railway engineering company based in Deptford (and later Charlton) in south east London, particularly noted for the manufacture of nails and rivets, Stone-Lloyd watertight ships' doors, brass ships' propellers, iron manhole covers, pumps, and railway carriage electric lighting and air conditioning systems. Stone Foundries and Stone Fasteners continue to operate in Charlton. History Josiah Stone established an engineering workshop in 1831, producing cast copper nails for the shipbuilding industry in nearby Greenwich. In 1842, with George Preston and John Prestige, he co-founded J. Stone & Co and relocated to premises in railway arches where he made hand pumps and manual firefighting engines. With the company's product range expanded to include rivets and other engineering items, the firm established a foundry in Deptford's Arklow Road in 1881, becoming a specialist in casting large copper propellers. The company's non-ferrous foundry moved to Charlton in 1917, and became J. Stone and Co (Charlton) Ltd in 1951. It produced 22,000 propellers for the Royal Navy during World War II (its products being fitted to battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers and numerous smaller vessels), plus propellers and water-tight doors for RMS Queen Mary, RMS Queen Elizabeth and Royal Yacht Britannia. In 1963 Stone's marine propeller business merged with Manganese Bronze (originally founded by Perceval M. Parsons in Deptford in 1876, incorporated as the Manganese Bronze and Brass Co in 1882, before relocating to Millwall and then Birkenhead in 1941) and manufacture moved to Birkenhead. Stone Foundries still operates at Charlton in a plant established in 1939 to produce aluminium and magnesium light alloy castings mainly for the aircraft industry, having produced specialised alloy parts and aircraft propellers for the Vickers Viscount and de Havilland Comet. In 1982, Stone Foundries was acquired by Langham Industries. In 1950 the Deptford works made rail and road transport products, nails, rivets and washers. In 1959 the firm became Stone Platt Industries. The Deptford factory closed in 1969, but production of nails and rivets continues at Langham Industries' Charlton-based Stone Fasteners. Sporting legacy Workers from Stone's Deptford Arklow Road foundry established a rowing club in 1923. Membership of the Stones Rowing Club was restricted to company employees, but after the company refused a grant to purchase new equipment, the club broke away from the works and set up independently, with headquarters in the nearby Lord Clyde public house (western end of Clyde Street). The club was then known as the Clyde Rowing Club before moving in the mid 1930s to another public house, The Globe on Royal Hill in Greenwich (demolished c. 1938), from which the club took its current name, Globe Rowing Club.

Arkwright is also suspected of murdering a fourth person during his killing spree, the charge of which Arkwright's trial judge ordered to lie on file. Arkwright was 21 years old at the time of the killings and was 22 when he was convicted. He is currently serving a whole-life tariff. Background Anthony Arkwright was born in the mining community of Wath-upon-Dearne, in what was then the West Riding of Yorkshire. He is one of five siblings who were abandoned by their mother at an early age; his father was a miner. Arkwright spent most of his childhood in care homes and performed badly at school, which led to a life of crime and a sentence in a borstal. Rumours persisted that he was the product of an incestuous relationship. By the time he was 21, Arkwright was working for scrap merchants in Mexborough, South Yorkshire, but he was sacked on 27 August 1988 for a poor attendance record. It was after this sacking that the 56-hour killing spree began. Murders and arrests Following his dismissal, Arkwright returned to Wath-upon-Dearne, where he stabbed his grandfather, 68-year-old Stanislav Pudoikas, which resulted in Pudoikas suffering paralysis. Afterwards, he dragged Pudoikas into a shed on his allotment and used a lump hammer to crush his skull. After killing his grandfather, Arkwright went on a pub crawl in Mexborough and dropped hints about the murder, saying things such as, \\"It's been murder on the allotment today.\\" It was believed that Arkwright's second victim was his grandfather's housekeeper, 73-year-old Elsa Kronadaite, whilst he was in the process of taking his grandfather's savings of ¬£3,000. The bodies of both Pudoikis and Kronadaite lay undiscovered for six days. The next to be killed was Arkwright's neighbour Raymond Ford, an unemployed former teacher who was already being bullied by him. Arkwright had also stolen items from Ford's flat and Ford reported him to the police for the thefts. Arkwright knew this and wanted revenge. At 3 am on 28 August 1988, he entered Ford's flat completely naked apart from a devil mask. Arkwright stabbed Ford more than 250 times and draped his entrails around the room that he had been murdered in. He then went home to shower off the blood and at 7 am, the police came to arrest him for burgling Ford's flat, completely unaware that Ford lay dead next door. After being interviewed for three hours and then released on police bail for a court appearance the following week, Arkwright went out for another drinking session, amazed at being a murderer allowed to walk free from a police station. On 29 August, early in the morning, Arkwright entered the specially adapted bungalow belonging to his other next-door neighbour, Marcus Law. Law, who was 25 at the time, was in a wheelchair after a motorbike accident. In what Arkwright would describe as a punishment for all the cigarettes that Law had scrounged off him, he stabbed Law at least 70 times, before trying to gut him. When this failed, Arkwright inserted one of Law's crutches into a gaping wound in his stomach. He also gouged out Law's eyes and inserted cigarettes into his eye sockets, ears and mouth. After he had left Law's bungalow, he bumped into Law's mother and remarked upon her son's suicide whilst smiling. She went to her son's bungalow and found him dead. Police arrested Arkwright, who confessed to four murders, which meant that searches for the bodies of his other victims had to be organised hastily. It was suggested that when shocked police had found the three remaining bodies, Arkwright felt that he was losing control, and so invented a fifth victim, leading to further searches of lakes and drainage ditches. Whilst at HMP Hull awaiting trial, Arkwright smeared the walls of his cell with excrement in a dirty protest at not being recognised and revered as he believed he should be. After convincing prison doctors that he was insane, he was transferred to Rampton Hospital in Nottinghamshire. Psychiatrists there determined that he was sane and fit to plead, with one doctor commenting that Arkwright was \\"the sanest person in the building\\". Trial At his trial in Sheffield Crown Court in July 1989, Arkwright pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life imprisonment. It was commented upon that Arkwright was an \\"evil fantasist\\" who had a desire to be as famous as Jack the Ripper. The case against Arkwright for killing Kronadaite was unproven and at the trial, the judge ordered the case to lie on file. In 2003, Home Secretary David Blunkett changed the law so that certain people sentenced to life in prison, would spend the rest of their lives there, with no chance of parole. This was challenged in 2013, when the European Court of Human Rights decreed that whole-life tariffs without the option for a review or parole amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment. However, the Court of Appeal ruled that the whole-life sentences were \\"entirely compatible\\" with the European Convention of Human Rights. In the media =Television= The television programme When Life Means Life broadcast an episode about Arkwright in its first series in 2012. =Podcast= Arkwright's case was featured in episode 168 of the dark comedy podcast series, Small Town Murder.

In 1995 he was awarded the Premiers Service Award by Bob Carr for services to the hospitality industry before training in fashion and design and taking over Skindeep Clothing, a small tailoring and fashion business in Sydney, in 1996. Under his guidance Skindeep Clothing became a multi-site men's fashion company specialising in custom-made suiting and costume production and design for locally produced and shot films such as The Matrix, Superman Returns, The Hard Word, Dirty Deeds, numerous television series and music concept and design work with acts such as Silverchair, Looking Through a Glass Onion for John waters and Human Nature and the Bell Shakespeare Company.

The decision by Irvine and his board to sack key management staff and suspend Flanagan on learning of their breaches of protocol and ASADA and WADA rules in 2011 was unpopular at the time and was made three days before the season opening match against the Gold Coast Titans, but was proven to be prudent and correct when long investigations by the NRL and government agencies subsequently suspended Flanagan from the sport for twelve months and sanctioned the other staff involved. = Notts County FC = In early 2014 Irvine was approached to change codes and join English Football League club Notts County F.C. with the club facing relegation and 9 points from safety.

He was elected in August 2017 at the age of 23 years, the youngest ever Kenyan member of parliament. Background and education Mwirigi was born on 7 January 1994 in Igembe South Constituency, Meru County. He is the sixth-born in a family of eight siblings. His family had modest means, but they could afford decent meals, according to his testimony. His father died in 2014, but his mother was still alive, at the time Mwirigi was elected to parliament in 2017. He attended Riaki Primary School and later Kirindine Day Secondary School , where he obtained his High School Diploma. He was admitted to Mount Kenya University, to pursue a Bachelor of Education degree, specializing in History and Kiswahili. He was pursuing the degree as a part-time student, since he had to work to raise his tuition and upkeep. At the time he was elected to parliament, he was in his third year at university. Work experience Prior to his political career, he worked as a laborer at Igembe Tea Factory, carrying logs for KSh350 (US$3.50) a day. Sometimes he worked at a timber yard owned by a friend, carrying logs there as well. Political career Beginning at age 19 years, while still in high school, he began to entertain the idea of becoming a member of the National Assembly of Kenya. His close friends encouraged him to pursue his dream. However, many others, including close family members tried to dissuade him from trying. The odds were stacked against him; he was too young, he did not belong to a political party and therefore lacked a ground political machine, he had no money and he had zero political experience. He stood as an independent candidate. This, according to him, ensured that his name would be on the ballot on election day. He feared that if he joined a political party, he would be rigged out of the primaries, due to lack of finances. He carried out a grassroots campaign, canvassing his constituency door-to-door, mainly on foot. Most of the resources used in the campaign were donated by well-wishers, according to Mwirigi. He won, beating his nearest opponent by over 3,000 votes and garnering 76 percent of the total.

At 18 polling stations, official counters had inadvertently not stamped papers with the official marks. The Labour candidate declared ‚Äòduly elected‚Äô, David Simpson, had a majority of only 11, and if the uncounted papers were included, Morgan (the Conservative candidate, and an incumbent) would have won instead by 7 votes.

The Divisional Court held the election was conducted ‚Äòsubstantially in accordance with the law as to elections‚Äô and the fact that small errors affected the result was not enough. Morgan appealed. Anthony Scrivener appeared for the Director of Public Prosecutions. Judgment The Court of Appeal declared the election invalid, because the result would have been affected.

The former suburb of Au is located in the original flooding area of the Isar. The 500-meter-long road runs between the end of the Ohlm√ºllerstra√üe (beginning of the street Am Nockherberg) and the Kolumbusplatz at the foot of the Isar river terrace. About 400 people live in Nockherstra√üe.  History  The middlepoint of the road was two mills on the Auer M√ºhlbach (15th century) and buildings for hunters from the electoral Falkenhof with the tavern Zum J√§gerwirt. The original name of the street was J√§gerh√§uselgasse or Bei den J√§gerh√§useln, as noted in the official register of house numbering for the Au suburb of 1857. In 1876, the street was renamed after the socially committed Nockher banking family to Nockherstra√üe. Their castle stood on the present Nockherberg. Beginning of the 19th century (recorded from 1813 and seen on plans of various house records), a dense development with so-called hostel houses was built on the slope side. In the northern part of the street, the hop fishery settled in with five fish ponds. Agriculture was on the decline in the middle of the 19th century. In addition to the agricultural areas, ponds and cattle stables, production facilities began to establish, first with one of the largest bedspring factories in southern Germany and after the Second World War, a branch of Rohde & Schwarz. The transition from agriculture to craft and industry took place at the same time as the incorporation of the town of Au into the city of Munich (1854). From around 1860, the opposite western side of the street was gradually built with rental housing. In addition, there were four taverns and a sauerkraut factory. Directly adjacent to the industrial district, dairy farming and pig breeding were continued until well into the 20th century. Until the year 1979, a poultry farm and a fish shop existed. During the Second World War, a large part of the houses was destroyed and not rebuilt on the slope side in favor of a planned green corridor. Today, only a few of the now, modern equipped, hostel houses exist as a reminder of the times. The rental housing on the side facing away from the slope were rebuilt in the style of the respective period from the 1960s and are gradually being converted into condominiums.

The festival hosts artists from Israel and around the world and lasts for three days. The Doof Festival aims to create a meeting place for culture and electronic music in Israel, a contemporary digital version of the Psychedelic movement in the 1960s, while preserving the values of the international raves movement. Over the years, the festival has expanded its vision in ecological directions of preserving the land, especially the beaches of Kinneret Sea. Today, the festival is a magnet for lovers of electronic music and the trance culture from Israel and abroad, and is considered one of the peak events of the trance culture in Israel.  History  The festival was started by three people, Shahar Zirkin, Yuval Ebenstein and Guy Barkai, childhood friends who were exposed to the psychedelic rock scene and the beginnings of the Israeli clubbing culture. After traveling around the world and becoming acquainted with electronic music, which was in its infancy in Israel, they began organizing underground desert parties in 1995 under the name Doof Project. the Doof brought with it tougher and more rough musical line that soon brought hundreds of people to their desert parties. The psychedelic musicians community built around the parties led to the opening of Doof Records in 1999. The label has produced dozens of albums and compilations that have become an integral part of the international trance scene, and to this day it is considered one of the important labels of the trance music. After seeing many festivals throughout Europe, the three decided to bring the European atmosphere to Israel and hold a festival of several days attracting people from all over the world and adding the DOOF festival to the European festivals round. The festival began in 2004 with complete secrecy and at the beginning of the way was based on dark-trance and more underground music. Later on, the teams of Paganka and Magaya were added to the festival, and since then the musical genre has expanded to include various types of trance and alternative music. The Paganka team joined the festival in 2011 and brought with it Progressive music that gave new layers to the festival. In 2013 the Magaya team joined the production of the festival and brought with it a rich alternative musical system, workshops and ecological design.

A leader of several strikes, he later became the first communist to serve on the General Council of the Trades Union Congress. Born in London, Papworth began working part-time from the age of eight. He first joined a trade union when he was 16, and led a strike at Morgan Crucible during World War I, while still a teenager. He then transferred to work at the Woolwich Arsenal, where he was involved in two separate strikes. In 1918, he joined the British Army, serving briefly before the end of the war. Papworth returned to civilian work at the end of the war, and joined the Labour Party and the National Association of Discharged Sailors and Soldiers. He struggled to find regular work until 1927, when he began working as a bus conductor with the London General Omnibus Company, based at Putney. He joined the Transport and General Workers' Union (TGWU), soon becoming secretary of his branch. The London General Omnibus Company announced pay cuts for staff in 1932. Leaders of the TGWU reluctantly agreed, but a significant minority of bus workers strongly opposed the agreement. Papworth, along with Bill Jones, Bill Payne and Frank Snelling, founded the Busmen's Rank and File Movement, which published Busmen's Punch and held meetings at bus garages around London. Many leading figures in the movement also held membership of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), and Papworth became increasingly sympathetic to the party, although he did not immediately join. In 1935, Papworth was elected to the Executive Council of the TGWU, a position which no communist had held. The following year, the Rank and File Movement led a campaign for a seven-hour working day and improved conditions of employment. When managers refused to negotiate, they launched a strike. This was unsuccessful, and its leaders, including Papworth, were expelled from the TGWU early in 1937. This spurred Papworth to join the CPGB, and he also spent a few months visiting Spain to observe the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, speaking in their support when back in the UK. He was also active in opposition to the British Union of Fascists. During World War II, Papworth was readmitted to the TGWU, and he again served on the executive committee of the TGWU from 1941. In 1944, he was also elected to the General Council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), the first communist to sit on the body. Through this, he travelled with Vincent Tewson and Vic Feather to investigate trade unionism in Greece, finding that the ruling Junta had imprisoned most trade union leaders. From the start of 1950, the TGWU banned CPGB members from holding offices in the union, so Papworth lost his official positions. Papworth instead devoted his time to the London Transport Friendly Society, of which he was secretary from 1951 until 1964.

History Zoothamnium was initially classified as a member of the family Vorticellidae by Ehrenberg in 1838. It was later reclassified to the family Zoothaminiidae, a new family defined by Sommer, in 1951. The unique ability of the central stalk to contract in a zig-zag pattern made the reclassification a necessity. Zoothamnium is a sessile peritrich, meaning it is a ciliated vase shaped protozoan that is nonmotile in nature. The genus comprises more than seventy species. Differentiation between species can often be difficult due to the strong similarities in form and function. The most commonly cited species are as follows: * Zoothamnium alternans * Zoothamnium arbuscula * Zoothamnium arcuatum * Zoothamnium bucciniiformum * Zoothamnium duplicatum * Zoothamnium florens * Zoothamnium grossi * Zoothamnium hentscheli * Zoothamnium ignavum * Zoothamnium intermedium * Zoothamnium maximum * Zoothamnium mucedo * Zoothamnium nii * Zoothamnium niveum * Zoothamnium paraentzii * Zoothamnium parahentscheli * Zoothamnium parahiketes * Zoothamnium pararbuscula * Zoothamnium pelagicum * Zoothamnium pluma * Zoothamnium plumula * Zoothamnium wangi * Zoothamnium zhanjiangense The species can be readily found in freshwater, brackish and/or marine waters between 5 ¬∞C and 25 ¬∞C., typically 0 ‚Äì 8 meters deep. They thrive in areas of high suspended solids as they are detritus and anaerobic bacteria consumers. They can be primarily found in eutrophic waters and along the coastal regions bordering the North Atlantic Ocean. They typically form a symbiotic relationship with a wide variety of animals, although some may be free living attaching to aquatic plants and inanimate substrates. Any solid substrate can provide a base for growth. Copepods with chitin covering are the main animal group affected. The ciliate may attach to the gills and reduce ability to pass oxygen to body tissues. This may result in hypoxia due to mechanical blockage and failure to thrive. This attachment may cause Black Gill Disease. or Surface Fouling Diseases. Zoothamnium has the potential to reduce reproductive abilities of the host with high prevalence. No histological damage occurs due to attachment, but if colonization becomes too great the host animal may die. left Morphology Ciliates that form branching colonies. The colonies can range in size from several zooids to hundreds of zooids depending on the species. Bodies take on a conical to almost spherical shape and are attached posterior with a stalk to the main stalk. The stalk allows for multiple ciliates to come into contact with a feed source once detected, or move away from a potential hazard as needed. The anterior end of the ciliates is covered in circular rows of cilia known as the somatic girdle. The main stalk that connects all of the ciliates branches is composed of a contractile spasmoneme, allowing stalk to contact as a single functioning unit. When contracting the colony can reduce its size by folding in as a single unit in a zig zag fashion. The protozoa can display polymorphism, or multiple physical forms of the same cell. Those on the stalks are shaped like rods, but those in the region of the ciliated oral apparatus of the zooids are shaped like small spheres. Three different forms of the individual ciliate cells are present at the ends of the stalk, which are distinct in both morphology and function: # The large macrozooids, the adult developed cell, size varies considerably (20‚Äì150 Œºm) and can transform into swarmer cells and leave the colony. These cells are large and spherical and attached at several random locations throughout the branching colony. # The microzooids are small cells specialized for feeding, which the colony does by consumption of their symbiotic bacteria and other organic particles. These cells are smaller and oval shaped and are present on every branch of the stalk in multiples. # At the terminal ends of the colony are specialized zooids that can elongate and facilitate the asexual reproduction of the colony. right Life cycle Initial colonization is established by swarmer cells. Once a somatic girdle or circular rows of cilia are developed, a mature macrozooid can leave the mother colony as a swarmer. Once a suitable substrate is found, an initial segment of stalk is produced to attach the cell to the new colonization point. Once settled, the colony begins to develop. All reproduction is accomplished by binary fusion. The terminal zooid cells will elongate and divide. The newly formed cell will attach to the same branch of the stalk as the terminal zooid and will mature into a microzooid. The colony will continue to grow, adding additional branching as needed. As the colony develops and resources become depleted, stressed cells can form cilia on all surfaces, including a basal wreath of cilia, mature into macrozooids, and will detach from the stalk and swim away. Colonies may become large, as the macrozooids may not have to travel far to find additional substrate. The initial colony will eventually enter into a senescent phase, where it will slow or even stop its biological functions of replication and release of swarmer cells. At this point microzooids will begin to die from the bottom of the stalk progressing to the top. A variety of bacteria will establish on the remaining stalk and decompose the materials.

Life He was born in Konigsberg, the eighth of twelve children born to major general Bonaventura von Rauch and his wife Johanna, n√©e Bandel (1752‚Äì1828). His brothers included Gustav (future Minister for War, general of the infantry and honorary citizen of Berlin) and Friedrich Wilhelm (future military attache in St Petersburg, adjutant general to Frederick William IV of Prussia and lieutenant general). Leopold's sister Rosalie Gr√§fin von Hohenau, n√©e von Rauch (‚Ä† 1879) married Prince Albert of Prussia (brother to King Frederick William IV and Emperor William I). From 1799 to 1803 he trained as an army cadet in Stolp and Berlin. His first posting was as an ensign in Number 36 von Puttkammer Infantry Regiment, then based in Brandenburg an der Havel. He fought against France in the War of the Fourth Coalition in 1806 and 1807. After Prussia surrendered he came off the active list but remained a half-pay second lieutenant. In 1809 he was assigned to the Number 8 Lifeguard Infantry Regiment, newly-raised in Berlin. Two years later he was promoted to adjutant and became the commander of the Normal Infantry Battalion, then attached to the Foot Guards Regiment in Potsdam. In 1813 he was promoted to first lieutenant and then staff captain. Whilst Prussia harried Napoleon's retreat from Russia in 1812 and 1813, he served as adjutant of the Guards Reserve Brigade, chief of the general staff of II Army Corps and adjutant to 1st Guards Brigade, winning the Iron Cross 2nd class. In the Battle of Kulm in 1813 he was so badly wounded that he was taken off active service and remained in adjutant posts for the rest of his career. One of these posts was on the staff of Duke Charles of Mecklenburg, commander of the Guards Brigade and brother of King Frederick William III's queen consort Luise. Charles wrote of Rauch: \\"Equally active and capable. He has an excellent attitude in all his manners and is highly recommended.\\" Rauch was made a major in 1819. He was transferred to the 2nd Foot Guards Regiment from 1822 to 1833 as court-major (Platzmajor) in Potsdam. In 1833 he was put in charge of the Allgemeine Kriegsschule in Berlin, which trained staff and general staff officers and later became the Prussian Staff College. He was made a lieutenant colonel in 1834, just before being made the Prussian commissioner for the Kalisch Review, a joint operation between Prussia and the Russian Empire in the Congress of Poland in 1835. At the end of the review he was awarded the Order of St Anna 2nd class. He was made colonel in 1836 and major general in 1842 before retiring in 1848. He died in Trzblitz twelve years after his retirement. Marriage and issue On 20 February 1827 he married in Prague. His new wife was Am√©lie von Levetzow, from the Teschow- Koppelow family (6 February 1805, Leipzig - 1 October 1831, Potsdam). Her parents were Joachim Otto Ulrich von Levetzow (chamberlain and court-marshal in Mecklenburg-Schwerin and lord of the manors of Hohen-Mistorf and Teschow) and his first wife Amalie von Levetzow (nee von Br√∂sigke). The couple divorced and Amalie went on to marry Friedrich Carl Ulrich von Levetzow (killed in 1815 at the battle of Waterloo) and then Franz Graf von Klebelsberg-Thumburg, former president of the Vienna Hofkammer. Am√©lie had two sisters - the elder was Ulrike von Levetzow (who inspired Goethe to write his Marienbad Elegy) and the younger was Bertha (who bought the estate at Netluk (Pnƒõtluky) to live near her mother and Ulrike). Goethe had contact with all three sisters and took part in Am√©lie's marriage. The couple had two sons, Franz (13 March 1828, Potsdam - 8 August 1911, Netluk/Pnƒõtluky) and Adalbert (20 August 1829, Potsdam - 18 February 1907, Ramholz). Both sons kept in close touch with their mother's sister Ulrike and after her death in 1899 ensured her correspondence with Goethe was kept intact and made available to the public. Franz grew up with Ulrike after his mother's early death and stayed there until he was 18 and remained in correspondence with her long afterwards. He served in the Prussian and Austrian armies and established a collection of minerals and archaeological objects, which in 1912 passed to the city museum in √öst√≠ nad Labem. He married Aminka Z√ºlich von Z√ºlborn (1833-1893) and had one son with her, Joseph von Rauch (1862-1911). Adalbert inherited the Trziblitz (T≈ôeb√≠vlice) estate from Ulrike, which was acquired from him by the city of Br√ºx in 1901. He rose to First Lieutenant in the Prussian Army and later retired as a Colonel in the Austrian Army. References  Bibliography (in German) * J. Schott: Die Familie v.

Boolean Intervals are half- opened and a counting point lays always inside at the beginning and the ending lays outside and is the entry-point of the next-following interval. Such an interval can represent any kind of stretch in production and material flow e.g. an assembly line, a storage or warehouse, a transport route etc. Alternative production and transportation stretches are mapped as parallel intervals, which are logical equivalent but have their own different data acquisition points. If a flow item passes a certain CP it has left the preceding interval and stays in the concerned interval at the same time. By this it can be assured that a flow object can stay only in one interval at a certain moment which is also true and evident for parallel intervals. Herlyn: PPS im Automobilbau. 2012, p. 131 ff. This kind of mapping material flow structure is necessary for a consistent calculation of the lead-time and complete cycle time for flow items which is extremely important not only for material flow planning but also for production planning and manufacturing operations management in general.  Using of Counting Points  Counting Points are used in different logistic areas like transportation, material handling, goods receipt and goods issue at the border of a plant, because this is often transfer of ownership. Another well-known counting points are receiving and issuing material items at the border of a storage or warehouse. Counting points play an important rule also in manufacturing and production scheduling and different concepts of material requirements planning e.g for the concept of Cumulative quantities (logistics) H.-P. Wiendahl: Fertigungsregelung ‚Äì Logistische Beherrschung von Fertigungsabl√§ufen auf Basis des Trichtermodells, p. 344 ff and the 'gross-net-method'. We can find CP also in the automotive industry where the production flow of a car is controlled, scheduled and monitored continuously at exactly defined check points resp. status points for the different manufacturing departments and shops and where the data is used for scheduling and optimization.

Keeping only the first of five stanzas, with additional two stanzas, it appeared in hymnals of the 19th century, and later in different versions in several regional sections of the Catholic hymnal Gotteslob. It is a frequently sung hymn in Easter services.  History  A hymnal appeared in Landshut in 1777, with the full title Der heilige Gesang zum Gottesdienste in der r√∂misch-katholischen Kirche (The holy chant for the divine service in the Roman Catholic Church),Landshuter Gesangbuch: der heilige Gesang zum Gottesdienste in der r√∂m.-kath. Kirche containing prayers and hymns in German for the church services and private contemplation. Franz Seraph von Kohlbrenner was the editor for the texts, for the musical part. The book offers no names of authors. It is assumed that Kohlbrenner and Hauner are the authors of all new songs in the hymnal. The hymn is part of regional sections of the Catholic hymnal Gotteslob, with various variants in text and melody. The Diocese of M√ºnster has it as GL 778 and recommends its use for Easter and Ascension. It has been called \\"a typical hit among hymns\\".(\\"Das ist so ein typischer Gassenhauer unter den Kirchenliedern.\\")  Text  is a new poetry in the spirit of Klopstocks. The original text had five stanzas of eight lines each, reflecting the resurrection of Jesus, closing each stanza with a threefold Alleluia. Of these stanzas, only the first is still common, but was expanded by two stanzas, first found in an 1866 hymnal from the Diocese of M√ºnster. The hymnal ' of 1874 for the Diocese of Paderborn presented these stanzas with a variant of the melody. They appear in the Gotteslob for the Diocese of Hamburg as GL 771 as follows:Gotteslob of Hamburg  Melody  The begins with a fanfare, using a fourth up. The interval also begins all other uneven lines. Regional melodies differ in repeats and time signature. While the original melody was in triple meter, the hymnal Sursum Corda had a version in common time. The Gotteslob of Diocese of Limburg has it (in two stanzas) in common time as GL 779.

His sons Leopold, Friedrich Wilhelm and Gustav also took up military careers. Life He was born in Peterskirchen/Oberbayern into a Bavarian family. His father was the teacher Johann Anton Rauch (c 1686‚Äì1745). He began his career in 1756 as a page at the court of the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel and in 1761 became an engineer in the Brunswick Army. Under Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel he took part in the closing phases of the Seven Years' War, namely in the 1761-62 sieges of Kassel (in which he was wounded), Meppen and Ziegenhain. In 1764 he was made a conductor in the Brunswick Engineer Corps, rising to lieutenant in 1766 and captain in 1772. On Charles William Ferdinand's recommendation, Rauch moved to the Prussian Army in August 1777. On personal instructions from Frederick II of Prussia Wortlaut bei Priesdorff (Lit.), S. 182 he became a teacher at the mining corps in the K√∂nigsberg garrison. In 1788 Frederick William II of Prussia founded a Royal Engineering Academy in Potsdam - Rauch moved there and was promoted to major. The institution also took part in military surveying and so Rauch travelled to Silesia in 1791 and the Glatzer Schneegebirge in spring 1792. He also began to write treatises on military theory and to produce collections of maps. He served as a captain of guides on the Prussian General Staff during the French campaign and helped take the fortresses at Longwy and Verdun. He then caught dysentery and stayed in a hospital in Koblenz until November 1792. The king made Ruach an oberst lieutenant in 1796 and put him in charge of the Engineering Academy. He became a major general in 1805 and was made governor of Stettin on the outbreak of the War of the Fourth Coalition in summer 1806, with the 77-year-old lieutenant general Romberg as his deputy. After the defeats in the battle of Jena-Auerstedt, Prussia's field army retreat and began to split up. Romberg's morale collapsed and when eight hundred French cavalry arrived before Stettin on 29 October 1806 he surrendered immediately without waiting to assess the size of the enemy force, which was vastly dwarfed by Stettin's garrison of 5,184. Rauch agreed to the surrender Oscar von Lettow-Vorbeck: Der Krieg von 1806 und 1807. 2. Band: Prenzlau und L√ºbeck. Mittler, Berlin 1892, S. 288‚Äì293. and so on 1 December was dishonourably discharged from the Prussian Army. He was later placed under house arrest and then in 1809 sentenced to life imprisonment in the Spandau Fortress. Gro√üer Generalstab (Hrsg.): 1806. Das Preu√üische Offizierkorps und die Untersuchung der Kriegsereignisse. E.S. Mittler & Sohn, Berlin 1906, S. 48‚Äì50. His fate led to protests within Prussia's officer corps, especially since Romberg had only ever been a scientist and lecturer and had never before commanded an army in the field. Frederick William's queen-consort Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz took up the cause, but she was only able to get the sentence commuted to life imprisonment in the town of Spandau rather than the fortress, though she did also get half of Rauch's pension as a major general resintated.
