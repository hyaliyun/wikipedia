Prior to the merger, a 1997 agreement had already made Northwest the home for a UW Medicine cardiac surgery program. History In 1949, the \\"Community Memorial\\" Hospital Association purchased a tract in North Seattle.\\"Our History\\", MEDinfo (Northwest Hospital & Medical Center), September‚ÄìOctober 2010 (50th Anniversary Edition), p. 6‚Äì7. Northwest Hospital opened in 1960, as the city's northernmost hospital. In 1965 the hospital acquired a radioisotope magna scanner, and over the rest of the 1960s they established a comprehensive rehabilitation program (1967), an inhalation therapy department (1967), a program for hearing disorders (1968), and a stroke center (1969). In 1970, they were the first Seattle hospital with a birth clinic offering the use of a single \\"birth suite\\" for labor, delivery, recovery, and postpartum care. The 1970s saw physical expansion of the emergency department (1973), the opening of a department of nuclear medicine (1971), and the 1977 establishment of the Northwest Hospital Foundation. Physical expansion continued in the 1980s with a new tower building (1983). In 1985, Northwest Hospital physicians pioneered the ultrasound-guided installation of a radioactive \\"seed\\" implant to treat prostate cancer. In 1993 they were the region's first hospital to offer the non-surgical gamma knife technique of treating brain tumors. In the 2000s, the emergency department expanded yet again (2001), and Northwest continued to adopt pioneering technologies such as minimally invasive surgical techniques, DynaCT angiogram technology (2005, another regional first), and robotic surgery (2007). They began to use electronic medical records and bedside medication reconciliation in 2007; that same year they converted to all- digital mammography. A sleep center opened in 2008. In 2011, work began on the region's first proton beam therapy center for cancer treatment. 2009 saw the introduction of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Physical expansion also continued with the enlargement of the hospital's surgical facility in 2010.

He was born in the village of Radzichava, Slutsk Raion. Hanchar graduated from the Belarusian State University Law faculty in 1979 and worked as law research worker at different major Belarusian institutions. Political career Beginning in May 1991, Hanchar worked as first deputy chairman of Maladzyechna mayor. In May 1994, he ran for the Constitutional Court of Belarus, but did not receive the support of most MPs. During the presidential elections in 1994, Hanchar was one of the most active in the election campaign headquarters of Alexander Lukashenko. In 1994, after the victory of Lukashenko in the presidential elections, Hanchar was appointed Deputy Prime Minister of Belarus, but soon resigned. Hanchar joined the opposition to the president and joined the United Civil Party, becoming a member of its Political Council (since 1995). In 1995-1996 he was general secretary of the CIS Economic Court. In 1995, Hanchar was elected to the Supreme Soviet of Belarus. In 1996 he was appointed chairman of the Central Commission on Elections, and was actively opposed to Lukashenka during the 1996 referendum. In 1996, he was dismissed by the president from his position. Hanchar never recognized the results of the 1996 referendum as legitimate. In 1998, Hanchar led an alternative Elections Committee during the presidential elections of 1999, organized by the opposition as a protest against constitutional reforms by Lukashenko.  Disappearance  Hanchar disappeared in Minsk on September 16, 1999, along with his friend, the businessman Anatol Krasouski. Pieces of broken glass and blood were found on the supposed site where Hanchar and Krasouski had been seen last. On December 5, 2002, they were officially declared as missing persons by the court. In January 2003, the Chief Prosecutor of Minsk suspended the criminal investigation of the disappearance of Hanchar and Krasouski. According to the former head of jail number 1 Oleg Alkaev (Aleh Alkaje≈≠), Viktar Hanchar was abducted and executed on the order of people close to President Lukashenko.–û–ª–µ–≥ –ê–ª–∫–∞–µ–≤: —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç –≤–∏–¥–µ–æ–∑–∞–ø–∏—Å—å —É–±–∏–π—Å—Ç–≤ –ó–∞—Ö–∞—Ä–µ–Ω–∫–æ, –ì–æ–Ω—á–∞—Ä–∞ –∏ –ö—Ä–∞—Å–æ–≤—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ Investigation of the disappearance of Hanchar and Krasouski is one of the main issues of the Belarusian opposition, and is also mentioned in the documents of international organizations.

For several years the Belarusian opposition has organized the Day of Solidarity with Belarus on the 16th of every month to commemorate the disappearance of Hanchar, Krasouski, Jury Zacharanka, Dzmitry Zavadski, and the mysterious death of Hienadz Karpienka. In December 2019, Deutsche Welle published a documentary film in which Yury Garavski, a former member of a special unit of the Belarusian Ministry of Interior, confirmed that it was his unit which had arrested, taken away and murdered Yury Zacharanka and that they later did the same with Viktar Hanchar and Anatol Krassouski.Belarus: How death squads targeted opposition politicians See also * List of people who disappeared References External links *Kidnapping of Hanchar and Krasouski: authorities have something to hide *Viktar Hanchar on ciwr.org Category:1957 births Category:1990s missing person cases Category:Belarusian jurists Category:Belarusian State University alumni Category:Members of the Supreme Soviet of the Republic of Belarus Category:Missing people Category:Missing person cases in Belarus Category:People from Slutsk District Category:United Civic Party of Belarus politicians ","title":"Viktar Hanchar"},{"id":"25026644","text":"IBM ThinkPad 760 was a notebook computer introduced in 1995 by the IBM corporation into the market as part of the ThinkPad 700-series.

It was founded as a District Lodge in 1957 and after various transformations (see below) was eventually recognised as Grand Lodge in 1980. This Grand Lodge is one of the five United Grand Lodges of Germany (VGLvD). It currently has members from a variety of nations and in addition to the \\"resident members\\" in Germany, there are \\"non-resident members\\" all over the world. Currently, 18 lodges work under the GL BFG, mainly in North Rhine- Westphalia, but also in Lower Saxony, Hamburg, Munich, Berlin and also near Frankfurt.GL-BFG, Lodges, accessed 14 November 2014 Ritual As with the other four Grand Lodges under the United Grand Lodges of Germany, the GL BFG is autonomous in matters of internal order and ritual. Of the Lodges of the GL BFG, 16 work in the English tradition with memorised English ritual texts using the ritual of the Emulation Lodge of Improvement as approved by the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE), one works a Scottish Ritual and there is one Lodge which uses the aforementioned Emulation Ritual, but translated into the German language and consequently this Lodge works in the German language. The GL BFG also supports separate Masonic orders (e.g. Mark, Royal Arch Chapter) of nearly all the rituals of English Freemasonry. History The GL BFG, like the American Canadian Grand Lodge of Ancient Free & Accepted Masonry (ACGL), was originally a military Masonic organisation for members of the Allied Forces in West Germany and was established as a district of the Grand Lodge AF & AM in 1957. In 1959, the District Grand Lodge of British Freemasons in Germany was founded and was raised to a Provincial Grand Lodge under the GL AF & AM of Germany in 1962. It then became an autonomous Provincial Grand Lodge and equal partner within the United Grand Lodges of Germany in 1970 and one year later changed its name to Grand Land Lodge of British Freemasons in Germany. In 1980 the name was again changed to the current Grand Lodge of British Freemasons in Germany. Relationship to other Grand Lodges As a member of the United Grand Lodges of Germany (VGLvD), the GL BFG has ceded the sovereignty rights of representation to Freemasons outside of Germany and to the German public to the VGLvD and does not formally have direct relations with any Masonic body outside Germany. The VGLvD is recognised as a \\"regular\\" Grand Lodge by the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE).UGLE, Foreign Grand Lodges, accessed 24 August 2014 Through the VGLvD, it recognises the existence of the Women's Grand Lodge of Germany (Frauen Grossloge von Deutschland, FGLvD); however, other male organizations purporting to be Masonic lodges, that are not part of the VGLvD within Germany are not recognised. The other four United Grand Lodges of Germany, which have widely varying traditions, are: * Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of Germany (Gro√üloge der Alten Freien und Angenommenen Maurer von Deutschland, GL AFuAMvD) * Grand Landlodge of the Freemasons of Germany (Gro√üe Landesloge der Freimaurer von Deutschland/ Freimaurerorden, GLL FvD/ FO) * Gro√üe National-Mutterloge ‚ÄûZu den drei Weltkugeln‚Äú Grand National-Mother Lodge, \\"The Three World-Globes\\" (GNML 3WK) * American Canadian Grand Lodge A.F. & A.M (ACGL) Seal of Grand Lodge of British Freemasons in Germany  Seal  The seal of the Grand Lodge of British Freemasons in Germany is a combination of images relevant to its early beginnings and whom it represents. Initially created using the seal of the United Grand Lodge of Ancient Free & Accepted Masons of Germany by Past Grand Master Theodor Vogel (31.07.1901 ‚Äì 09.02.1977), Grand Master of the United Grand Lodges of Germany, It was combined with seal of the Grand Land Lodge of the Freemasons Order by adding a triangle and a key, to symbolise a trowel, to the lower chain link. The three sections of the chain represent \\"three times three\\" frequently found in German freemasonry. This seal is placed top & center to represent its seniority. Sitting below the seal are the images of the German Federal Eagle, to the left and a Lion representing United Kingdom to the right. Centrally placed are compass's, by which freemasons, symbolically, measure their life and conduct. The three castles represent, and are a reminder to, the original Provincial Grand Lodge of British Freemasons in Germany (1962 - 1971). The Latin moto ESTO PERPETUA means \\"Let it be Perpetual\\" but is here used in the form of ‚ÄúMay it last forever‚Äù.

This association and its various branches became a focal point of masonic instruction and learning which enhanced interest and membership, the Hannover Branch well exceeded thirty in number and it made meeting in the homes of its members impossible and so a committee were tasked with finding a suitable location. Stirling House (Kurt Schumacher Kaserne) in Hannover, the headquarters of Hannover and Hamburg districts, was used for the majority of meetings. Furniture was acquired from surplus held by the British Army and ingenious craftsmen produced folding tables and other lodge furnishings that made holding lodges of instruction easier. Meetings were held once a month, but no regular day was found due to Stirling house being in use by the military, the British Military Hospital in Hannover was used when Stirling House was unavailable.Saxony Lodge 842 Founders Jewel At these meetings the only permanent officers were preceptor, secretary and treasurer, no members were allowed to hold office for more than one meeting. The meetings only consisted of opening, closing and ceremony rehearsals, these were so popular that there was a waiting list for the lodge offices. These meetings continued until 1957, when the news was received that fraternal relations had been restored between the United Grand Lodge of England and the German masonic constitutions. Permission was applied for to form a lodge under the German constitution with dispensation to conduct business and ceremonies, using Emulation Ritual, in the English language. This application was sent to the Grand Master of Ancient and Free Accepted Masons. Saxony Lodge No.842 was consecrated im May 1957, the hard work and perseverance of the founding members laid the foundation to a lodge that is still has a strong presence in Celle. Today the lodge works under the framework of the Grand Lodge of British Freemasons in Germany, one of the five partner Grand Lodges that make the United Grand Lodges of Germany. The lodge has evolved from a lodge membership of predominantly British servicemen to an international lodge with members of many nations. = Lodge Seal = The Lodge Seal/ Jewel (Jewel is the term used within masonry to describe an ornament worn on the chest or around the neck on a collar, typically displaying the Lodge crest or seal) is dominated by the rearing stallion that is represented widely within Niedersachsen (Lower Saxony) and stands proudly on the Niedersachsen flag. The Founders Jewel has the added ribbon of yellow and white which represents the colors of Celle, where are lodge was founded in 1957. Copies of which are held in the Celle town archives along with the consecration summons. = Lodge House = It was through the recommendation Grand Master of Ancient and Free Accepted Masons that the Lodge house in Magnus Strasse 2a, Celle could be used as the permanent masonic home of Saxony Lodge No.842. = Ritual = The lodge practices its masonic ritual in the English language following the English constitution provided by the United Grand Lodge of England  The Rose of Minden Lodge Number 918  200x200pxThe Rose of Minden Lodge was originally established as a military Masonic organisation to provide a masonic home for members of the British Allied Forces in and around the German city of Minden, North Rhine-Westphalen. On 24 Jun 1972 it was discussed at a meeting of the Royal Electrical & Mechanical Engineers (REME) Officers Mess, Johansen Str 1, in Minden, the possibility of forming a Lodge in the Minden area. This was agreed and a petition was raised and passed to the Land Grand Master for review. It was agreed that a local Minden Lodge would be used for the regular meetings. It was also agreed that the founding Lodge Officers purchased their own regalia & collars and then subsequently present it as a gift to the Lodge for future officers to use. At a further meeting on 5 September 1972, which took place at Suffolk School, Elizabeth Barracks, Minden, the consecration would take place at 1100Hrs in the Temple of the local Herford German Lodge ‚ÄúZur Roten Erde‚Äù Unter den Linden 34, on 28 October 1972 in the city of Herford. This location was chosen for the consecration meeting as the agreed new home for the Rose of Minden Lodge was at the time a small building consisting of just two rooms and renovations would not be completed in sufficient time for the founding ceremony. In 1990, once the cold war had finished, the 1990 Options for Change Strategic Defence Review reduced the number of British Forces in Germany and withdrew out of Minden. As a result, the Lodge decided to move its seat from the city of Minden to an area where British Forces were still deployed in Germany and in turn returned to its founding ceremony location in Herford, which from 1993 also became the home of 1st UK Armoured Division. Freemason lodges typically choose titles in relation to their founding location, to a masonic theme or character. The Rose of Minden title was suggested by Brother B Potter and as such was used to publicise the founding of the Lodge to Freemasons in the surrounding area by an article in the local Minden Bulletin. The apt title is taken from the battle honour which was awarded to British Army units who fought in the Battle of Minden on 1 August reflecting its military connection at the time of its founding. This battle honour is still a celebrated tradition with units of the British Army today. In 2010 under the UK's \\"Strategic Defence and Security Review,\\" (SDR) the deployment of British forces in Germany was announced to be ended by 2020 and the withdrawal of 20,000 service personnel started to take place. Late in 2019 it was announced that a small contingent would remain in Germany to act as a forward base in support of UK's role within NATO. The personnel will remain located at the 45-square mile (117-square kilometer) Sennelager Training Area near Paderborn which provides extensive live firing and training facilities. M√∂nchengladbach will keep Ayrshire Barracks which can store approximately 2000 vehicles. The Wulfen Munitions Storage Facility will remain open for the storage of operational ammunition. Finally, an Engineer unit equipped with M3, self-propelled amphibious bridging vehicles will remain co-located with German troops supporting the NATO infrastructure in Minden. The natural catchment area for new members for the Lodge was traditionally the military units that were stationed in the surrounding areas of Herford, Minden, Bad Oeynhausen & Bielefeld. This had a dramatic affect on membership with the changes announced in the 2010 SDR. However as British forces have been located in Germany for 75 years it naturally followed that a number of those decided to stay after their military service and according to the German Statistics Office \\"Destatis\\" the number of British ex-patriots living in North Rhine-Westphalen in 2017 was 25,125. With Freemasonry in Germany growing steadily in numbers and becoming ever more popular since the second world war, it was noted that as well number the of expats joining, German and other European nationals were also applying for membership. This unusual & unexpected turn in events was found to be the increased interest in conducting masonic emulation & ceremonies in the English language rather than that of their own. This large number of expats and other nationals has enabled the Lodge and similar Lodges to survive the recent troop withdrawal. = Lodge Seal = The seal of the lodge is a combination of images relevant to its identity and masonic connections. Bordering the seal are an ear of corn and a sprig of acacia, the ear of corn representing plenty and the sprig of acacia to represent Hiram Abiff, a central character within masonic history. Within the border is the name of the lodge and its warranted lodge number. The abbreviation for word number is not written as No. as would be expected but as Nr. showing its German heritage. Centrally placed are a red rose and the combined image of an architect's square & compasses. The rose, as the lodge name suggests, represents the Rose of Minden and the square & compasses is the most recognisable symbol within freemasonry. Two pillars are placed either side of the rose and square & compasses, these represent the two pillars placed outside of King Solomon's temple, again, key objects within masonic history. Atop the pillars are two spheres showing terrestrial and celestial maps representing that freemasonry is seen by masons as being universal. Lodge House used by The Rose of Minden Lodge. A listed building, built in 1907. City of Herford = Lodge House = The listed Lodge building was built in two phases by the architect and Freemason Wilhelm K√∂ster(1860‚Äì1946). The first phase started in 1906 and completed 29 July 1907 which was opened with large celebrations and attended by masonic visitors from as far as Berlin totaling 177 guests. The second phase was completed in 1924 where accommodation was created on the first floor for lodge members to reside if needed. It has remained the home of the 1899-founded German Lodge Zur Roten Erde who are responsible for the complete building project. The costs of land at 12,000 German Mark and building costs of 42,000 German Mark partly provided from lodge savings and a loan from the district Sparkasse bank. In 1935 Freemasonry was outlawed by Nazi's and the building was taken over by Nazi Party who replaced a large pentagram symbol on the exterior of the building with an eagle and Swastika (Hakenkreuz). From 1937‚Äì1945 the building served as the district headquarters of the Nazi Party who also used the surrounding buildings of Logenplatz for accommodation. In 1946 the building was returned to Lodge Zur Roten Erde who own and manage the building to this day. The layout of the building has changed little since its completion. The ground floor holds a large entrance with en-suite washrooms, reception/ dining room and the lodge temple its self. The first floor provides conference, practice, storage rooms and living accommodation. The cellar, which originally held the lodge kitchen, wine cellar and wood store is now a used as a restaurant. Five local lodges from East(ern) Westphalia-Lippe (Ostwestfalen-Lippe (OWL)) regularly share the building for masonic meetings. = Ritual = The lodge practices its masonic ritual in the English language following the English constitution provided by the United Grand Lodge of England  Beaver Lodge Number 885  The \\"Five Points Club\\", founded on 11 December 1956 by Canadian soldiers stationed in Germany, are the seeds of what became Beaver Lodge No 885, which was founded under the premise of continuing the community of Freemasons among those serving in Germany. On 11 June 1962 it was agreed to found a regular Lodge under the name \\"Beaver Lodge\\" under the grouping of British Lodges in Germany. On March 16, 1963, the Lodge was consecrated in the Soester Lodge House by Most Worshipful Brother R M√ºller-B√∂rner, the Grand Master of the Great National Lodge AF&AM.; At this meeting, the RW Bro JP Railton was also appointed Provincial Grand Master of the new Provincial Grand Lodge of the British Freemasons in Germany. The Lodge resided at that time in the Soester Lodge House after the owners (German Lodge \\"Loge Zur Bundeskette\\") agreed to share the building for a very modest rent of only 60 DM per month. This relationship lasted for about 20 years before the Lodge was forced into being a traveling lodge and then sub-sequentially to premises in Werl. Canadian unification went into effect on 1 February 1968 & the Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Army, and Royal Canadian Air Force were reorganised into a single entity known as the Canadian Armed Forces, or simply Canadian Forces (CF). At about the same time, Canadian manpower was cut as new defense priorities were announced. The NATO brigade was reduced from a peak in the mid-1960s of 6,700 troops in size down to 2,800 men. After years of very happy garrison life in the vicinity of Soest, the entire brigade was moved in December 1970 to southern Germany as part of a centralised Canadian Forces Europe contingent. January 1970 had seen the Lodge grow to a respectable strength of 97 members but this withdrawal threatened its existence and future In 1968 relations with the resident German Lodge deteriorated beyond repair which led to Beaver Lodge being asked to leave. This situation forced Beaver Lodge into becoming a traveling Lodge with no permanent location that could be called the Lodge seat. This situation for the Lodge, although interesting became a heavy burden and led to a considerable deterioration in member strengths, despite help from regional German Lodges to keep it running, especially the Lodges in Hamm and Dortmund. In order to return the Lodge to a stable status, agreements were made in 1983 to meet regularly at the Park Hotel in Werl. With the search for a permanent Lodge home finally ended the relief of a finding a new location was marred by the sadness at having to leave their home city of Soest and the long relationship with the Lodge Zur Bundeskette, which had been so outstanding in its early years. This new temple in the Park Hotel Werl was inaugurated by the Grand Master RW Bro A Settle and Lodge meetings were held there regularly from then onward until the Lodge moved to the Stadthalle (City hall) Werl on 2 October 1999. The beginning of the year 2004 saw the relationship to Soest and the Lodge Zur Bundeskette be re-established, and a positive course of discussions, the Lodge was able to move back into its old home in Ro√ükampffsgasse No.1 on 19 November 2004. Since then the Lodge has continued to grow in membership and enjoys a very international positioning with members of Australian, Italian, Scottish, Northern Irish, Irish, German, Canadian and American origin, among others. = The Lodge Seal = (Image needed) The seal comprises of a large hexagram containing square and compass‚Äôs with letter ‚ÄòG‚Äô, a maple leaf and a beaver. The hexagram is said to have been found within the buildings of King Solomon's temple, from which the philosophies and studies of Freemasons said to be inspired. The Square and compass‚Äôs with the letter ‚ÄòG‚Äô denotes the Grand Geometrician of the Universe or God and can be seen in the upper triangle of the hexagram. The maple leaf representing its Canadian origins is placed centrally and a beaver from which the Lodge takes its name is placed upon the maple leaf. = Lodge House = (Image needed) The Lodge house located Rosskampfssgasse 1, Soest was built in the middle ages around 1500. Since then it has changed hands many times and survived historical events such as the 30 Years War, WW1 & WW2. On 14 September 1873 the local Germam Soester Lodge \\"Zur Bundeskette\\" acquired the building and in 1907/08 converted it to a full Lodge house with a great hall being built on as extension at the rear. In 1935 the Nazi party forced the Lodge to sell the building to the City of Soest and from 20 March 1936 the building was used by the Hitler Youth (Hitlerjugend) - Bann 123. On 1 July 1950 the building was returned to ‚ÄúLoge Zur Bundeskette‚Äù. By 1968 the building was in need extensive repairs which were funded by selling the garden grounds and great hall which were turned into rented living accommodation. The building has been home of Beaver Lodge No.885 since 19 November 2004 = Ritual = The lodge practices its masonic ritual in the English language following the English constitution provided by the United Grand Lodge of England  References  # GL-BFG, Lodges, (Subordinate Lodges) # UGLE, Foreign Grand Lodges, # VGLvD, Mitgliedsgro√ülogen (Member Grand Lodges) # Destatis - German Statistics Office (German) # The Grand Lodge of British Freemasons in Germany A History 1999 by John T.

He had been an Anarchist during the First World War. It was during this time that he lost an arm while raiding the Bank of Tarragona.Robert Alexander. The Anarchists in the Spanish Civil War. Great Britain: Janus Publishing Company Ltd., 2007. p. 786. As a railroad worker, he joined the Organizing Committee of the First Provincial Congress of the CNT of Tarragona (April 11‚Äì13, 1920), where he served as Secretary of the Bureau at its first meeting and spoke at the closing ceremony. He also served as Secretary of the Maritime Transport Union of the CNT in 1921, and held other CNT positions throughout the 1920s.Diccionari de Sindicats i Sindicalistes, biogr√†gies del Moviment obrer de Catalunya: Rodr√≠guez Salas, Eusebi. His politics however began to move away from Anarchism. He eventually joined Joaqu√≠n Maur√≠n's Workers and Peasants' Bloc, serving on its central committee. He then left in 1935 to join the Socialist Union of Catalonia, which in 1936 became the Unified Socialist Party of Catalonia. Known for his fearless and outspoken persona, he rose quickly within the ranks of the PSUCBurnett Bolloten. The Spanish Revolution: The Left and the Struggle for Power during the Civil War.

Salas was unpopular with the CNT-FAI due to his Communist leanings.Alexander, p. 786. During an internal government crisis in April 1937, an article in the CNT newspaper Solidaridad Obrera on the 17th stated that \\"[The] way to prevent the sacrifices of our comrades from being reduced to naught is... to create an army that will guarantee victory in the war and the Revolution and to remove from the public life of Catalonia, Comorera, Aiguad√©, Rodr√≠guez Salas, etc.\\"Bolloten, p. 398. On April 24, 1937 an attempt was made on his life,El D√≠a Gr√°fico, 25 Apr. 1937; Treball, 25 Apr. 1937. Cited in Bolloten, p. 399. followed by the successful assassination of PSUC member and Secretary of the UGT Municipal Workers' Federation Rold√°n Cortada a day later. Salas condemned the assassination of Cortada and attributed it to \\"uncontrollables\\"; agent provocateurs who were hostile to the Popular Front. Salas ordered a raid in the Anarchist stronghold of the Hospitalet under the pretext that Cortada's killers may have been there.La Vanguardia, 28 Apr. 1937; La Humanitat, 28 Apr. 1937; Diari de Barcelona, 29 Apr. 1937. Cited in Bolloten, p. 400. Telef√≥nica Incident The Telef√≥nica building in Barcelona was a center of telecommunications. It \\"allowed for the monitoring of any government or army communique between Valencia and the Generalitat and the frontier.\\"Landis, p. 345. As part of the October 24, 1936 Catalan decree giving unions control of large commercial and industrial concerns seized by them during the opening days of the Spanish Civil War, the Telef√≥nica (telephone exchange), owned by the Compa√±√≠a Telef√≥nica Nacional de Espa√±a (a subsidiary of the International Telephone and Telegraph Corporation), was nominally controlled by a joint CNT- UGT committee with an additional Catalan government delegate. The Anarcho- Syndicalists, however, dominated the building's affairs.Bolloten, p. 403. The Republican Government was concerned with the control that the Anarchists exercised over conversations. On May 2, 1937, for example, a call from Republican President Manuel Aza√±a to Catalan President Llu√≠s Companys was interrupted by the Anarchist telephonist who said that the lines were being used for more important matters.Hugh Thomas. The Spanish Civil War. United States: Modern Library, 2001. pp. 635-36. Companys would later state that \\"all the telephone calls of the Generalitat authorities, of the President of Catalonia and of the President of the Republic were intercepted.\\"Llu√≠s Companys, Notes and Documents on the Fighting in Barcelona, 3‚Äì7 May 1937, chapter 27, n. 155. Cited in Bolloten, p. 404. PSUC Secretary Joan Comorera condemned the Anarchists over this, saying that, \\"All the interior controls of the telephone exchange were in the service, not of the community, but of one organization, and neither President Aza√±a nor President Companys, nor anyone else, could speak without an indiscreet controller overhearing.\\"June 2, 1937 speech. Cited by Bolloten, p. 403. In defense of the policy, Diego Abad de Santill√°n said it was used to be aware of any attempts by the government to conspire to \\"whittle away the people's rights\\" and for the CNT to act accordingly.D. Abad de Santill√°n. Por qu√© perdimos la guerra. p. 133. Cited in Bolloten, p. 404. It is likely that many in the Catalan Government (with the exception of CNT members) advocated action against the Anarchists, though none were aware in advance of Salas' actions.Bolloton, p. 404. Jos√© Tarradellas, according to Aza√±a's memoirs, was critical of Salas' actions; calling them \\"hazardous\\" due to a lack of government resources with which to prepare for any resistance, and advocated negotiations without the sending of forces to the building.Aza√±a. Obras. Vol. IV. pp. 576-77. Cited in Bolloton, p. 404. On the afternoon of May 3, 1937 Salas, possibly acting on the orders of the Communist-supported Interior Security Minister Aiguad√©,This view was supported by the Solidaridad Obrera and Manuel Cruells i Pifarr√©, who was a staff reporter on the Diari de Barcelona. Mayo sangriento, p. 48.

Salas ordered the building's sentries to disarm and told the door guards that he was there to take charge of the building's affairs in the name of the Government.V√≠ctor Alba and Stephen Schwartz. Spanish Marxism versus Soviet Communism: A History of the P.O.U.M. New Jersey: Transaction, Inc., 1988. p. 189. He then entered the Censors Department on the first floor, and at that point CNT members within the building began using a machine-gun nest to open fire on Salas' men.Thomas, p. 636. Salas phoned in for help, with a company of Assault Guards arriving along with FAI members Dionisio Eroles and Jos√© Asens.Landis, p. 346. Thomas, p. 636. Eroles called on the CNT workers within the building to cease shooting and to surrender their arms.Thomas, p. 636. See also Gabriel Jackson. The Spanish Republic and the Civil War. Princeton University Press. p. 369. Cited in Landis, p. 346. As the Anarchist workers within the building fired their guns into the air shortly before agreeing to surrender their weapons, the events in the days ahead now referred to as the Barcelona May Days had begun. CNT councilors demanded the resignation of both Salas and Aiguad√©. With this demand came additional calls for the dismissal of all PSUC members within the Catalan Cabinet, but neither Catalan Premier Tarradellas nor Home Secretary Ayguades complied.Landis, p. 346. As part of the new provisional government agreed upon days later to stop the fighting in Barcelona, Salas was to remain head of the general commissariat (though Aiguad√© sacked) until the arrival of Antonio Escobar, a Catalan delegate appointed by Valencia.Bolloten, p. 421. On the Sixth, new CNT Minister of Justice Juan Garc√≠a Oliver noted in secret discussions via teletypewriter to Mariano Rodr√≠guez V√°zquez that \\"The minister of the interior has ordered the immediate dismissal of Rodr√≠guez Salas.\\"Bolloten, p. 427.

After graduating from Sam Houston High School in 1931, he attended St. Mary's Seminary in La Porte until 1934, when he was sent by Bishop Christopher Edward Byrne to study at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. He there earned a Bachelor of Sacred Theology (1936) and Bachelor of Canon Law magna cum laude (1939). While in Rome, he was ordained to the priesthood by Bishop Ralph Leo Hayes on March 19, 1938. Harris then furthered his studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., where he earned a Licentiate of Canon Law in 1940. Following his return to the Diocese of Galveston in 1940, he became a professor at St. Mary's Seminary in La Porte. He was later named chancellor of the diocese in 1948 and a diocesan consultor in 1953. He was raised to the rank of Domestic Prelate by Pope Pius XII in 1956. On July 4, 1966, Harris was appointed the first Bishop of the newly erected Diocese of Beaumont by Pope Paul VI. He received his episcopal consecration on the following September 28 from Bishop John Louis Morkovsky, with Bishops Leo Christopher Byrne and James John Hogan serving as co-consecrators, at St. Vincent de Paul Church in Houston. For the next five years, he laid the foundations for the new diocese and implemented the decrees of the Second Vatican Council. On April 27, 1971, Harris was named Coadjutor Bishop of Austin and Titular Bishop of Rotaria. He succeeded Bishop Louis Joseph Reicher as the second Bishop of Austin upon the latter's resignation on November 15, 1971. He successfully challenged Bishop Reicher over ownership of trust funds established by Reicher in ecclesiastical and civil courts. During his tenure, the diocese increased in Catholic population but suffered repeated financial difficulties. Harris, following a slight stroke in 1984, resigned as Bishop of Austin on February 25, 1985. He spent his retirement in Houston, Texas, pursuing various subjects of personal interest including genealogy, photography, and computer systems. On March 31, 1988, Harris died at St. Anthony Nursing Home in Houston, Texas. He was 74. He is buried at St. Anthony Cathedral in Beaumont, Texas.

A native of Indiana, he also served as a county commissioner in Multnomah and Clackamas counties in Oregon. Early life Lambert was born on December 1, 1825 in Vigo County, Indiana, a few miles northeast of Terre Haute. He was raised on a farm by his parents, Hugh and Nancy (n√©e McClain) Lambert. At the age of 20, Lambert left Indiana for Iowa, where he worked and went to school until 1849, when he headed west again. He traveled on the Oregon Trail, arriving at the Philip Foster Farm at the end of the Barlow Road in Oregon Country on September 14, 1850. He spent the winter in Salem. In the spring of 1851, he traveled to Yreka, California for the California Gold Rush, but he soon returned to Oregon's Willamette Valley, where he worked in a sawmill and for Meek & Luelling in Milwaukie hauling logs. Next he joined the surveying team of Mr. Ives. He helped lay out the Willamette Meridian north from Portland to Puget Sound, and the Willamette Baseline, the first standard parallel in Oregon. He also surveyed a few tiers of townships, including Salem. He returned to working in sawmills and as a log hauler until 1853, when he was again employed by William Meek and Seth Luelling, this time in their orchard business. In 1854, Lambert married Clementine Miller and they took up a Donation Land Claim in Powell Valley. Orchardist Lambert cherries, from the USDA Pomological Watercolor Collection In 1859, Lambert and his father-in- law, Henry Miller, bought half of Meek's interest in Meek & Luelling's orchard. The venture did not start out well, because of a drop in the price of apples and the poor yield from the formerly productive trees. Lambert introduced new horticulture methods that in two years restored the health of the trees and again allowed them to produce \\"mammoth\\" crops of apples. Lambert became the sole owner of the orchards, which are notable for being the first to produce cultivated fruit in Oregon. Lambert cherry Lambert developed what became known as the Lambert cherry, by grafting a volunteer seedling, found in 1848 under a Napoleon cherry tree to the rootstock of a May Duke cherry. The crown of the tree died in 1880 and a new tree grew from its roots that was not a May Duke, nor was it identical to the original seedling. The resulting cherry was large, richly colored, flavorful, and had a small pit, and it immediately became popular. Lambert introduced his cherry to the Oregon Horticultural Society in 1896 and it became one of the most important cherries grown in the early Oregon orchards, along with Royal Annes, Bings, and Black Republicans. In 1916, it was called the \\"finest cherry grown in America\\". Other work While living in Multnomah County in 1858, Lambert was elected to serve on the county commission. He served as a Clackamas County Commissioner in 1864. In 1887, Lambert was a founding member of the Oregon Horticultural Society. In 1890, he helped establish the Citizens Bank of Portland and became its president. Lambert managed to keep the bank open during the financial Panic of 1893, when over 500 banks failed. He also served as president of White Publishing Company.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 140. Death and legacy Joseph and Clementine Lambert had ten children, eight of whom survived into adulthood. Their two sons and six daughters included author Elizabeth Lambert Wood. Clementine died in the early 1890s, and Joseph Lambert died in Portland, Oregon, on November 12, 1909, at the age of 83. J. H. Lambert is one of the 158 names of people who are notable in the early history of Oregon painted in the friezes of the House and Senate chambers of the Oregon State Capitol. Lambert's name is in the House chamber. His former employer Seth Lewelling (formerly Luelling), developer of the Bing cherry, is so honored on the Senate side.

With less than a minute left in regulation, tied at 13, Florida State marched down into Clemson territory, where, with 3 seconds left, Hopkins made a 55-yard field goal to win the game. This was an important ACC victory for the Seminoles. In 2011, while playing against Wake Forest, Hopkins kicked his 109th point after try (PAT) in a row, breaking the previous FSU record. He would not miss a PAT until September 8, 2012, leaving him at 145 successful attempts, the sixth longest streak in NCAA history. On November 18, 2012, Hopkins set the NCAA Division I FBS record for career points scored by a kicker at 442 points with a 26-yard field goal in the second quarter versus the Maryland Terrapins. Hopkins would finish the day with six more points upping the record to 448 points. His record for most career field goals was later broken in 2016 by Arizona State University kicker Zane Gonzalez.http://www.espn.com/college- football/story/_/id/17750925/arizona%C2%A0state-kicker- zane%C2%A0gonzalez%C2%A0breaks-ncaa-record-made-field-goals Professional career Buffalo Bills Hopkins was drafted by the Buffalo Bills in the sixth round with the 177th overall pick in the 2013 NFL Draft, joining punter Shawn Powell and quarterback EJ Manuel, his former teammates at Florida State. On May 10, 2013, Hopkins signed a four-year contract with the Buffalo Bills. On August 19, 2013, Hopkins was named the starting placekicker over veteran Rian Lindell. On September 2, 2013, Hopkins was revealed to have sustained a groin injury. This prompted the Bills to sign Dan Carpenter. Due to a slow recovery from that injury and the need to further open roster spots, Hopkins was placed on injured reserve following Week 5. Hopkins was given a chance to earn back his roster spot during the 2014 season, but lost the kicking competition to Carpenter; the Bills released Hopkins on August 25, 2014. New Orleans Saints Hopkins was signed to the New Orleans Saints practice squad on December 17, 2014. He was then signed to a future/reserve contract at the end of the 2014 season and competed for placekicking duties with Shayne Graham. On September 5, 2015, the Saints announced they had released Hopkins after losing the competition to Zach Hocker. Washington Redskins / Football Team Hopkins and Marquette King in a game against the Oakland Raiders Hopkins was signed by the Washington Redskins on September 14, 2015, after they had released Kai Forbath. On October 14, 2018, Hopkins kicked a career- long 56-yard field goal against the Carolina Panthers. On November 15, 2015, Hopkins kicked a career-high four field goals against the New Orleans Saints. On October 30, 2016, Hopkins missed a potential game winner in the late stages of overtime which would eventually end in a 27-27 tie against the Cincinnati Bengals. During the 2016 season, Hopkins set a franchise record with 34 field goals made. On October 15, 2017, Hopkins suffered a partially torn hip muscle during a game against the San Francisco 49ers, and was placed on injured reserve days later. He was activated back to the 53-man roster on December 16, 2017. On March 12, 2018, Hopkins signed a three-year contract extension with the Redskins. On the 2018 season, Hopkins converted 25 of 26 extra point attempts and 26 of 29 field goal attempts. In the 2019 season, Hopkins converted 21 of 22 extra point attempts and 25 of 30 field goal attempts.

In the 2012 election, he was defeated by Democrat Cheri Bustos.Schilling: Looking forward to making pizza again. Seattle Post Intelligencer. November 7, 2012 In 2014, he ran for his former seat, but lost again to Bustos. Schilling again ran for public office in 2020 for Iowa's 2nd congressional district. He lost the Republican primary to State Sen. Mariannette Miller-Meeks. Early life, education, and business career Schilling was born and raised in Rock Island, Illinois. He graduated from Alleman Catholic High School and attended Black Hawk College. Schilling worked at Container Corporation of America between 1983 and 1987 and was a union steward for the local chapter of the United Paper Workers International Union. He then worked as an insurance agent for Prudential Insurance Company between 1987 and 1995, where he was ranked in the top 5% of all Prudential agents during his last year. He was also the treasurer for the United Food and Commercial Workers Union for four of those years. In 1996, he and his wife opened Saint Giuseppe's Heavenly Pizza in Moline, Illinois; the restaurant is still owned by the family and Schilling ran the restaurant until taking office, when he left his son in charge.Hardly Settled in House, but Already in Hot Seat According to public personal financial disclosures, Schilling's restaurant has dropped in value from a range of $100,000 to $250,000 down to between $50,000‚Äì$100,000. Schilling's son and campaign manager Terry Schilling said, \\"The real estate market has really taken a hit in East Moline. It just goes to show that Bobby Schilling has a real stake in this economy.\\"Report lists assets, income, debts for Schilling, Bustos U.S. House of Representatives Elections =2010= Schilling grew up as a Democrat, but has become more conservative over the years and now characterizes himself as a \\"Reagan Republican.\\" He was also influenced by radio and television personality Glenn Beck. Schilling was one of the 9‚Äì12 Candidates, a group led by Beck, and signed the 9‚Äì12 contract of principles and values. Schilling has said he was inspired to run for office because he was preparing to franchise his restaurant, but cancelled his plans when he saw then-Presidential candidate Barack Obama telling Joe the Plumber that the government needed to \\"spread the wealth around.\\" Schilling announced his candidacy in April 2009 and officially filed for the Republican nomination in October 2009. Schilling vowed not to participate in the congressional pension program, to keep his private health insurance instead of the congressional plan, to donate any pay raises he receives, to limit himself to no more than eight years in Congress, and not to vote for any bill he hasn't read. \\"I'm not going to make a career out of this,\\" he says. Early in the campaign, political websites rated the 17th District race \\"safe Democratic.\\" However, by Election Day the race was rated \\"leans Republican\\" by RealClearPolitics, Cook Political Report, CQ Politics, and The New York Times. The race was profiled on CNN as one of the country's top 100 House races, in which they said, \\"Schilling trails in the overall money race, but he's raised enough to get his message out and give the incumbent something to worry about.\\" In September 2010, Schilling was named to the National Republican Congressional Committee's \\"Young Guns\\" program. Hare criticized Schilling for living 0.99 miles outside the 17th District, though the Constitution only requires congressmen to live in the state they wish to represent. Schilling's wife notes that the family's restaurant is in the 17th and employs people and pays taxes there. She also says the family fell out of the district because of gerrymandering. Unopposed in the primary election, in the general election, Schilling won by an unexpectedly large margin, taking 53 percent of the vote to Hare's 43 percent. Notably, he carried Hare's home county, Rock Island County, a normally heavily Democratic county that is home to the district's two largest cities, Moline and Rock Island, by nine points. After the election, Schilling hired as his chief of staff Mike Roman, a political consultant known for posting a video showing alleged voter intimidation during the 2008 presidential election. Roman, along with policy director Scott Tranter, resigned from Schilling's office in April 2011. Schilling's campaign set an off-year fundraising record for a challenger in the 17th district, amassing about $89,000 in 2009. Schilling's campaign fundraising relied largely on individual donors, who accounted for about 80 percent of the $1 million raised by his campaign. Hare depended more heavily on political action committees, who contributed about two-thirds of his campaigns $1.3 million total. Following his election, Schilling has relied more on political action committees to help retire his campaign debt, with the bulk of his December 2010 fundraising coming from PACs, including Wal-Mart, the American Medical Association, Caterpillar Inc. and Archer Daniels Midland Co. Schilling ended the campaign with a total of $1,095,167 raised and $1,078,911 spent. The following organizations endorsed Schilling in his 2010 run for Congress: The Illinois Federation for the Right to Life PAC; CatholicVote PAC; the Quincy Tea Party group; John Deere PAC; and the United States Chamber of Commerce. Individuals who endorsed Schilling included: U.S. Representative Aaron Schock (R-IL); U.S. Representative Michele Bachmann (R-MN); former Governor of Massachusetts Mitt Romney; political figure and author Joe the Plumber (Joe Wurzelbacher); and, Sgt. John F. Baker, Jr., recipient of the Medal of Honor. Newspapers were evenly divided in endorsing Schilling over Hare, with the Chicago Tribune and the Sauk Valley News among those supporting Schilling. In October 2010 Schilling was endorsed by the Chicago Tribune. =2012= Schilling ran for re-election in 2012 and faced Democrat and former East Moline City Council Alderwoman Cheri Bustos in the general election. He has been added to the National Republican Congressional Committee's Patriot Program, which is designed to defend incumbent Republicans.NRCC adds 10 members to incumbent-protection program Bustos received a significant assist from the 2010 round of redistricting. The 17th already had a modest Democratic lean, but the Democratic-controlled legislature redrew the district to make it even more Democratic. Notably, Quincy, Decatur and the district's share of Springfield were cut out, replaced by the more Democratic portions of Peoria and Rockford. National Journal's Cook Political Report named Schilling one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012. Schilling has raised $1.4 million and had $950,000 cash on hand as of June 30, 2011.FEC Records While initially rated as a \\"lean-Democrat\\" race by major sites, in September 2012, Roll Call, the Cook Political Report, and the Rothenburg Political Report upgraded the race to \\"toss-up\\", with Cook saying Schilling had an advantage. Schilling was endorsed by the Chicago Tribune, the Rockford Register Star, CatholicVote, the National Rifle Association, former Congressman Tom Railsback, the National Federation of Independent Business, and the Galesburg Register-Mail, among other endorsements. In the November 2012 elections, Bustos defeated Schilling by a 53%‚Äì47% margin. According to the Seattle Post Intelligencer, Schilling was \\"looking forward to focusing again on his pizza business after losing a second term.\\"Schilling: Looking forward to making pizza again Seattle Post Intelligencer. November 7, 2012. =2014= It was widely expected by political analysts that Schilling would challenge Bustos to reclaim the seat in 2014. On July 8, 2013, he officially announced his candidacy for his old seat in the 2014 election. In his announcement, he said Bustos has been failing the middle class, and criticized her for not supporting any budget plans in the legislature. According to The Hill, Schilling \\"historically has not been a strong fundraiser but is known as a skilled grassroots campaigner.\\" During 2013, Bustos raised approximately $1.1 million and Schilling raised approximately $297,000.

He lost the Republican primary to Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a state senator and the Republican nominee in 2008, 2010, and 2014. Tenure Schilling's wife and 10 children attended the congressional swearing-in on January 5, 2011, attracting some notice and an interview with Diane Sawyer. His early actions as a congressman included joining 25 other freshman Republicans in voting against extending the USA PATRIOT Act; that the 45 minutes allotted for floor debate was inadequate to discuss these concerns. In February 2011, Schilling joined 130 House Republicans in voting against a $450 million budget cut for an extra F-35 fighter-jet engine‚Äîa project that the U.S. Department of Defense had repeatedly tried to kill, and that Defense Secretary Robert Gates called \\"a waste of nearly 3 billion.\\" Schilling voted for a package of cuts that included a $230 million federal grant to build an Amtrak line from Chicago to Iowa City, though he had supported the project during his campaign, calling it \\"critically important to both the economy and the environment of the Midwest.\\" The planned rail line was a celebrated project by many in his district, including local mayors. Schilling defended his vote, arguing it was a question of prioritizing, separating wants from needs, and when he looked at the big picture, the rail service did not make the cut. He also stated that his constituents elected him to address national debt and deficit problems in Washington, not to take a business-as-usual approach. In June 2011, Schilling introduced a bill to prevent members of Congress from receiving their congressional pension before they reach the Social Security retirement age. During the 2011 debt ceiling crisis, Schilling voted to raise the debt ceiling. In October 2011, a California resident issued a death threat promising a reward to anyone who assassinated Schilling. The threat is being investigated by the FBI and the United States Capitol Police. Schilling said he was advised by authorities to \\"lay low\\" while they investigated the threat and a spokeswoman for Schilling said the Schilling family was taking the \\"recommended precautions\\". According to The Hill, the person behind the threat may be the one behind similar threats against George W. Bush, several high-ranking current and former security and defense officials, and Rep. Mike Coffman of Colorado. Schilling said, \\"It's a general threat to all members of Congress, but they specifically called my name out in the threat. You just don't know what people are thinking...It's something we're not going to take lightly.\\" Schilling gave the Republican response to the President's weekly radio address on October 29, 2011. In September 2012, Schilling was given the \\"Friend of Agriculture Award\\" by the Stephenson County Farm Bureau. In October 2012, he was given the \\"No Labels Problem Solvers Seal\\". Political positions Schilling was considered to be a tea party candidate in the 2010 election. He holds the following positions: * He is pro- life, and spoke at the 2011 March for Life. * He opposes gun control legislation and is a full supporter of the second amendment. * He strongly believes that a parent should not mutilate children because of sexual beliefs * He has said that the federal government should stop regulating education and that local schools should be under local control. * He views health care reform as a top priority. but supports repealing the Democrats' version of health care reform, believing it is unconstitutional. He supports tort reform and legalizing the purchase of insurance across state lines. * He is fiscally conservative, and believes in small government. * He supports term limits for members of Congress. * He opposes the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. * He supports lowering the corporate tax rate. * He supports a troop surge in the War in Afghanistan., and He opposes bringing Guantanamo Bay detainees to Thomson, Illinois; instead he supports bringing the detainees to trial before military courts rather than the U.S. civilian, federal courts. * He supports expanding and updating missile defense systems.

A more direct explanation of XMT starts with the rudimentary abstraction that made serial computing simple: that any single instruction available for execution in a serial program executes immediately. A consequence of this abstraction is a step-by-step (inductive) explication of the instruction available next for execution. The rudimentary parallel abstraction behind XMT, dubbed Immediate Concurrent Execution (ICE) in , is that indefinitely many instructions available for concurrent execution execute immediately. A consequence of ICE is a step-by- step (inductive) explication of the instructions available next for concurrent execution. Moving beyond the serial von Neumann computer (the only successful general-purpose platform to date), the aspiration of XMT is that computer science will again be able to augment mathematical induction with a simple one-line computing abstraction. The random-access machine (RAM) is an abstract machine model used in computer science to study algorithms and complexity for standard serial computing. The PRAM computational model is an abstract parallel machine model that had been introduced to similarly study parallel algorithms and complexity for parallel computing, when they were yet to be built. Researchers have developed a large body of knowledge of parallel algorithms for the PRAM model. These parallel algorithms are also known for being simple, by standards of other approaches to parallel algorithms. This large body of parallel algorithms knowledge for the PRAM model and their relative simplicity motivated building computers whose programming can be guided by these parallel algorithms. Since productivity of parallel programmers has long been considered crucial for the success a parallel computer, simplicity of algorithms is important. Multi-core computers are built around two or more processor cores integrated on a single integrated circuit die. They are widely used across many application domains including general-purpose computing. Explicit Multi-Threading (XMT) is a computing paradigm for building and programming multi-core computers with tens, hundreds or thousands of processor cores. Experimental work published in 2011 and 2012 demonstrates significantly greater speedups for advanced PRAM algorithms on XMT prototypes than for the same problems on state-of-the-art multi-core computers. Work published in 2018 shows that lock-step parallel programming (using ICE) can achieve the same performance as the fastest hand-tuned multi- threaded code on XMT systems. Such inductive lock-step approach stands in contrast to multi-threaded programming approaches of other many core systems that are known for challenging programmers. The XMT paradigm was introduced by Uzi Vishkin. The main levels of abstraction of XMT The Explicit Multi- Threading (XMT) computing paradigm integrates several levels of abstraction. The work-time (WT) (sometimes called work-depth) framework, introduced by , provides a simple way for conceptualizing and describing parallel algorithms. In the WT framework, a parallel algorithm is first described in terms of parallel rounds. For each round, the operations to be performed are characterized, but several issues can be suppressed. For example, the number of operations at each round need not be clear, processors need not be mentioned and any information that may help with the assignment of processors to jobs need not be accounted for. Second, the suppressed information is provided. The inclusion of the suppressed information is, in fact, guided by the proof of a scheduling theorem due to . The WT framework is useful since while it can greatly simplify the initial description of a parallel algorithm, inserting the details suppressed by that initial description is often not very difficult. For example, the WT framework was adopted as the basic presentation framework in the parallel algorithms books (for the PRAM model) and , as well as in the class notes . explains the simple connection between the WT framework and the more rudimentary ICE abstraction noted above. The XMT paradigm can be programmed using XMTC, a parallel multi-threaded programming language which is a small extension of the programming language C. The XMT paradigm include a programmer‚Äôs workflow that starts with casting an algorithm in the WT framework and proceeds to programming it in XMTC. The XMT multi-core computer systems provides run-time load-balancing of multi-threaded programs incorporating several patents. One of them Vishkin, Uzi. Spawn-join instruction set architecture for providing explicit multithreading. U.S. Patent 6,463,527.

XMT prototyping and links to more information In January 2007, a 64-processor computer University of Maryland, press release, June 26, 2007: \\"Maryland Professor Creates Desktop Supercomputer\\". named Paraleap,University of Maryland, A. James Clark School of Engineering, press release, November 28, 2007: \\"Next Big \\"Leap\\" in Computing Technology Gets a Name\\". that demonstrates the overall concept was completed. The XMT concept was presented in and and the XMT 64-processor computer in . Since making parallel programming easy is one of the biggest challenges facing computer science today, the demonstration also sought to include teaching the basics of PRAM algorithms and XMTC programming to students ranging from high-school to graduate school. Experimental work reported in for the Maximum flow problem, and in two papers by for the Graph Connectivity (Connectivity (graph theory)), Graph Biconnectivity (biconnected graph) and Graph Triconnectivity (Triconnected component) problems demonstrated that for some of the most advanced algorithms in the parallel algorithmic literature, the XMT paradigm can offer 8 times to over 100 times greater speedups than for the same problems on state-of-the-art multi-core computers. Each reported speedup was obtained by comparing clock cycles on an XMT prototype relative to the fastest serial algorithm running on the fastest serial machines. XMT prototyping was culminated in , establishing that lock-step parallel programming (using ICE) can achieve the same performance as the fastest hand-tuned multi-threaded code on XMT systems. This 2018 result sharpens the contrast between XMT programming and the multi- threaded programming approaches employed by nearly all other many-core systems, whose race conditions and other demands tend to challenge, and sometimes even fail programmers .

In modern Hebrew, \\"erusin\\" means engagement, but this is not the historical meaning of the term, which is the first part of marriage (the second part being nissuin). Since the Middle Ages it is customary for the marriage to occur immediately after the betrothal, and to perform the betrothal during the marriage ceremony itself. Previously this was not the case, and there were often several months between the two events.Ketubot 57b In Hebrew and classical rabbinic literature, betrothal is frequently referred to as sanctification (Hebrew: Kiddushin, ◊ß◊ô◊ì◊ï◊©◊ô◊ü), on account of the bride becoming \\"sanctified\\" (dedicated) to the groom.  In the Hebrew Bible  The idea of erusin as the minimum necessary condition to apply the death penalty for adultery, but less than a complete marriage, appears in Deuteronomy. A non- traditional view is that the betrothal was effected simply by purchasing the girl from her father (or guardian). The price paid for her (bride price) is known by the Hebrew term mohar (◊û◊ï◊î◊®)., , , , It was customary in biblical times for the bride to be given part of the mohar. Gradually it lost its original meaning, and the custom arose of giving the mohar entirely to the bride, rather than to her father. The traditional commentators do not necessarily explain mohar this way. Rashi understands mohar as a form of ketubah, an agreement to pay a certain amount upon divorce,Rashi Genesis 34:12; Exodus 22:16, Mikraot Gedolot, six volume Shilo edition, 1969 and Nachmanides understands it as sovlanut, a sort of dowry or engagement present.Ramban, Exodus 22:16, Chavel edition, Mossad HaRav Kook, Jerusalem, 5732 Rashi understands Rachel and Leah's complaint to Jacob (\\"we are considered strangers to him for he has sold us\\") as saying that it was not normal for a father to sell his daughters, at least not without also giving them a dowry.Genesis 31:15, Mikraot Gedolot, six volume Shilo edition, 1969 The girl's consent is not explicitly required by any statement in the Bible, neither is there explicit permission to ignore it. In one Biblical story, Rebecca was asked whether she agreed to be married before the marriage took place.  In the Talmud   The legal act  The Talmud states that there are three methods of performing erusin; by handing the woman a coin or object of nominal value, by handing her a document and through consummation (sexual intercourse), although the last is prohibited by the Talmud.Talmud, Kidushin 12b In all cases the woman's consent is required; however, it can be implied by her silence.Jewish Encyclopedia, Consent (http://jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=736&letter;=C) In religious law, two valid witnesses must see the ceremony.Abraham Danzig, Hokhmat Adam 129:16  The ceremony   The blessings  The erusin is preceded by a blessing over wine and then the bircat erusin (betrothal blessing).The Jewish Way in Love & Marriage, Rabbi Maurice Lamm, Harper & Row, 1980, Chapter 15 If forgotten before the ceremony, it can be recited before the ketubah is read.Made in Heaven, A Jewish Wedding Guide by Rabbi Aryeh Kaplan, Moznaim Publishing Company, New York / Jerusalem, 1983, Chapters 20 and 21 Originally the blessings were recited by the groom but today it is more common for someone else to recite them such as the wedding's Rabbi.  The betrothal  Today, the custom is to perform the betrothal by giving the bride an object whose value is well known, and fairly constant: a gold ring without a stone. This is in accordance with the first method mentioned above. The actual betrothal now takes place. The groom takes the ring and says in Hebrew, Behold, you are consecrated to me with this ring according to the laws of Moses and Israel. The groom now places the ring on the bride‚Äôs index finger.  The ketubah  In order to separate the erusin and nissuin - the two parts of the wedding - the ketubah is now read.  Other issues  For legal purposes, a betrothed couple is regarded as husband and wife. Similarly, the union can only be ended by the same divorce process as for married couples. However, betrothal does not oblige the couple to behave towards each other in the manner that a married couple is required to, nor does it permitText of the Birkat Erusin the couple to have a sexual relationship with each other. The rabbis prohibited marrying without an engagement (shiddukhin). Therefore, an old custom is to sign a Shetar haT'na'im as a formal form of engagement, forming an informal declaration of the couple's intentions,Adler, Binyamin. Sefer haNisuim Kehilchatam, haMesorah Publishing, Jerusalem, 1985. chapter 3, paragraph 184-5. and is read close to the start of the betrothal ceremony.

Established in 1885, Coal City was initially a farming community until coal was discovered in the area. Small-scale mining began to take place, and because the mining operations were a mile or two away from the mines at National and Consumers, it was assumed that the citizens of the town would lack workplace stress. Coal production began to decline in 1935, and the town was essentially abandoned with just two residences occupied by the late 1960s. History Former mining trestle in Coal City In 1885, a group of settlers established a town in Carbon County, Utah, and called it Oak Springs Bench. Because the town's elevation was approximately , farming and ranching were difficult. However, soon after the town was settled, coal was discovered in the area. Small-scale mining took place under the Great Western Coal Mines Company, but mining operations weren't large due to the town's distance from the nearest railroad. In August 1921, the permanent town site was platted and renamed Coal City, after the deposits of coal in the area. The town was incorporated in October 1921. Although most of the houses were tents, a log school house served Coal City in 1925, and was replaced by a brick schoolhouse in 1927. Later that year, a couple stores and a bakery were constructed, and made up the business district. A few dozen homes were constructed around the stores. The town's residents lacked stress from mining operations because they were located away from the larger mining operations in National and Consumers. At its peak, the population was about 70. In 1926, the mine superintendent, George Storrs, was indicted for mail fraud. Though he was cleared of charges, in December 1926, Storrs's mining company went bankrupt and halted operations. The town began to decline in 1935 and by 1940 it was uninhabited. A few buildings remain in Coal City, including two stores, several houses, and a few outbuildings.

The Barton Brothers drove a herd of 3,000 cattle over the trail, and the cattle were the first to feed on the government lands in western Kansas. In the fall of 1872, they came to the area and established a ranch along the Arkansas River. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway was laying track in southwestern Kansas, and they chose the Barton Ranch as headquarters for the town site. It was named Pierceville in honor of Chas. W. and Carlos Pierce, who were members of the original Atchison & Topeka Railroad company. The post office was established on June 10, 1873, and the town began to grow with a store and dugouts. Then tragedy struck on July 3, 1874. Indians who had been defeated in a fight in Texas were heading north and were looking for settlements along the Santa Fe Railroad. Once they got to Pierceville, they set fire to the store and chased the train that came through the town firing their arrows at the train and into the windows. It was learned later that this was the same group of Indians who had attacked the German family and killed the parents, a son and a small child before kidnapping the four daughters. The girls were with the Indians during the attack on Pierceville but were rescued later. It was not until 1878 that a house and a store were built and the post office was reestablished on July 24. The town was platted in 1886 and the population was 400. There was a newspaper, hotel and a hardware store. By 1930, the population was 166.

The novel was Sakurazaka's breakthrough science fiction novel, earning wide praise from fellow novelists including Yasutaka Tsutsui and Ch≈çhei Kanbayashi and was entered in contention for the Seiun Awards. The book was published in Japanese by Shueisha under their Super Dash Bunko imprint in December 2004, and was later released in English by Viz Media under their Haikasoru imprint. All You Need Is Kill follows a soldier named Keiji Kiriya, who, after dying in a battle with extraterrestrials, is caught in a time loop that makes him live the same day repeatedly, allowing Kiriya to improve his fighting skills. A manga adaptation, written by Ry≈çsuke Takeuchi and illustrated by Takeshi Obata, was serialized in Shueisha's Weekly Young Jump magazine between January and May 2014 and was also published by Viz Media in its Weekly Shonen Jump magazine. In November 2014, the Viz translation was released in a collected edition that included the entire series. A graphic novel adaptation was released in North America in May 2014. A film adaptation from director Doug Liman starring Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt, titled Edge of Tomorrow, was released on May 30, 2014. The English-language film tie-in edition of the novel also uses this title. Plot The story is told from the perspective of Keiji Kiriya, a new recruit in the United Defense Force. Despite equipping its soldiers with powered exoskeletons, the UDF is losing its fight against the mysterious \\"Mimics\\", extraterrestrials which have laid siege to Earth. Keiji is seemingly killed on his first sortie after killing an unusual-looking Mimic but, through some inexplicable phenomenon, he wakes and finds that he has returned to the day before the battle. As this process continues, he finds himself caught in a time loop as his death and resurrection repeat time and time again. Keiji's skill as a soldier grows as he passes through each time loop in a desperate attempt to change his fate. After several dozen loops, he realizes his fate is similar to that of Rita Vrataski, a prominent ace who preferred to use a battle axe rather than a firearm. He uses his knowledge of the day to get close to her and her mechanic, from whom he gets a copy of her massive axe. He learns to use the weapon well; the boltgun that most troops are issued quickly runs out of ammo and jams easily. Realizing that he is a fellow looper, Rita confides in Keiji, telling him of the system the Mimics use: on death, they have the ability to send a signal into the past, allowing them to see the future and change their behaviour to avoid that fate. In each group of Mimics, there is one that acts as a central nexus that can cause the day to loop, as well as several antenna Mimics, all of which signal the loop to reset; Keiji became trapped in the loop as a result of contact with one such antenna. To escape as Rita once did, Keiji must first kill all the antennae and then the nexus. The Mimics constantly adapt to Keiji's attacks. He and Rita manage to eliminate the nexus, only to have the loop reset with Rita forgetting what has transpired. After telling Rita this, she acknowledges that they missed one antenna. On the 160th loop, they proceed to eliminate the antennae again. Rita then attacks Keiji once they are out of sight of allied forces, explaining her hypothesis that being trapped in the loop has modified their brains. In essence, both of them are similar to the antenna Mimics, meaning one of them has to die before killing the nexus; otherwise, the loop will continue indefinitely. Reluctantly, the two battle. Keiji mortally wounds Rita and stays by her side as she dies. Before Rita dies, Keiji confesses his developing feelings for her before she tells him to win the war quickly and prevent anyone else from suffering their fate. He slaughters the remaining Mimics and destroys the nexus. Weeks later, he is hailed as a new hero of the United Defense Forces while he silently reflects on what transpired and the sacrifice needed for them to win the battle. He paints his exoskeleton blue in honor of her memory. Characters ; :A new recruit in the United Defense Force. He finds himself caught in a time loop where he wakes up one day in the past after having been killed on the battlefield. Through the training and battles he experiences in these loops he comes into his own as a soldier. After the death of Rita and his elevation to hero of the United Army, he is given the moniker, \\"Killer Cage\\" and has his armored exoskeleton painted blue in honor of Rita's memory. :In the Edge of Tomorrow film adaptation, his counterpart is an American named William Cage, played by Tom Cruise. ; :A U.S. special forces soldier. Highly decorated and peerless in battle, she is seen as a hero by the entire world and known as the \\"Full Metal Bitch\\" to other soldiers.

Like Keiji, she has also been through a loop of her own, from which she gained her experience and reputation, and comes to assist Keiji after learning of his loops. She was noted to hate the color red while favoring blue. However, she chose to paint her armored exoskeleton red in order to draw attention from the enemy in combat.

A republished version was released on June 19, 2014 (). Haikasoru released an English-language translation trade paperback of the novel as \\"All You Need Is Kill\\". Sakurazaka was inspired by an online account written by a video game player, where comments on how restarting the game after the playable character's death allowed for trial and error improvement made the writer conceive a story where a hero wound up \\"being played over and over\\". Prior to writing, Sakurazaka consulted other time loop- based fiction such as the film Groundhog Day.

Focus The Everglades Foundation is dedicated to advancing an understanding of the Greater Everglades ecosystem and its irreplaceable environmental and economic value. The organization is funded primarily from private donations. The Foundation‚Äôs board covers administrative and fund raising expenses separately and entirely each year. This allows the Foundation to state that 100 percent of each donation goes directly to support programs to restore the Everglades. Donations provide scientists, policy analysts, researchers, communications experts and other professionals with funding to address complex issues involved in saving the River of Grass.

She is known for starting the Oslo cabaret Chat Noir in 1912, and also for introducing the children's song \\"Tuppen og Lillemor\\" to the Norwegian public. Early and personal life Caroline Lasson was born in Christiania as the daughter of lawyer Christian Otto Carl Lasson and Alexandra Cathrine Henriette von Munthe af Morgenstierne. She was a granddaughter of lawyer and politician Peder Carl Lasson, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway. She was a sister of composer Per Lasson and painter Oda Krohg, and sister-in-law of the painters Christian Krohg and Frits Thaulow. She had a close relation to the Danish writer Holger Drachmann, who later married her sister. She was married to Russian writer Michael Semionovitsch Feofanoff from 1904 to 1916, and to barrister and songwriter Vilhelm Dybwad from 1916. She died in Oslo in 1970, 99 years old. Career Lasson took song lessons with Eva Nansen, and later song education in Dresden. She made her concert debut in 1894, at Br√∏drene Hals' concert house in Kristiania. She started touring in 1895, visiting many European cities, singing while accompanying herself playing lute. She advanced from street singer to performing at cabarets and restaurants, and occasionally in musical comedies and plays, including performances at the K√∂nigliche Hoftheater in Stuttgart. After several years of touring she settled in Kristiania, where she had singing roles at musical comedies at Centraltheatret and Fahlstr√∏ms Teater. In 1912, together with her later husband Vilhelm Dybwad, Lasson started the cabaret Chat Noir in Oslo, modelled after the Paris cabaret Le Chat Noir. Vilhelm Dybwad wrote songs for the cabaret, and her nephew Per Krohg made the first stage decorations. To start with, Chat Noir was a literary cabaret, and among its contributors were the poets Herman Wildenvey and Arnulf √òverland. Bokken Lasson chaired the Chat Noir until 1917, and the cabaret has lasted until today, more than hundred years. She made her first song recording in 1912, the songs \\"Tuppen og Lillemor\\" and \\"Det lille Vandspand\\". The 1912 recording of \\"Tuppen og Lillemor\\" is also found on the 1983 album . In the late 1920s she started the Cabaret Intime, where she performed herself, along with other musicians such as Kirsten Flagstad, Maja Flagstad, Cally Monrad and Lalla Carlsen. Bokken Lasson was interested in antroposophy, educated at the Steiner school, was an active song educator, and continued her song career by giving concerts and being guest artist in musical comedies. She has published song books and autobiographical books. In 1962 a bronze statue of her was revealed in Homansbyen in Oslo, sculptured by Joseph Grimeland.

Education Henry Hainworth was educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton and at Sidney Sussex College in Cambridge. Diplomatic career Hainworth joined the Consular Service in 1939 and in 1940 he was posted to the embassy in Tokyo. He was in Japan on the day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and had to wait six months for repatriation, by which time the first American air raids on Tokyo were already taking place. Hainworth was subsequently deployed to the Ministry of Information in Delhi, where he was employed for the rest of the war on public information and propaganda work. In 1946 he went back to Tokyo, among the first diplomats to return to the embassy. They found their offices and houses had been impeccably safeguarded by Japanese staff throughout the war, the only damage had been inflicted by men of the Royal Navy sent to secure the compound as the occupation forces arrived in 1945. Hainworth spent five-year stint in Tokyo, which was still devastated by wartime firebombings, then, after a spell in London and 30 months in Bucharest, where he experienced communist dictatorship at its most repressive, he was sent to the Nato defence college in Paris. However, the Suez crisis meant he was dispatched to the office of the political adviser to the commander of British forces in the Middle East, based in Nicosia in Cyprus. During the summer and autumn of 1956 that office was caught up on the one hand with the Greek Cypriot insurgency against British rule, on the other with the Anglo-French planning for the attack on Egypt. Hainworth was subsequently promoted to the rank of counsellor, he became the head of the Foreign Office‚Äôs Atomic Energy and Disarmament Department, followed by two years‚Äô engagement with the Brussels negotiations for British membership of the European Community. He then spent five years as the ambassador‚Äôs deputy in Vienna and, in 1968, was appointed ambassador to Indonesia. Hainworth‚Äôs obituary notes: ‚ÄúHe went to a country which had put an end to its undeclared war with Malaysia only two years earlier. In that war British forces had played a leading and vigorous part in defence of Malaysia, grappling with the Indonesians in the jungles of Borneo (see Indonesia‚ÄìMalaysia confrontation). The Indonesian leader, Sukarno, was gone, but the army leaders who had overthrown him remained, and with them much of his hostility to Britain. Internally, the Indonesian Army‚Äôs massacre of many of the Chinese minority had left bitter memories. The country was racked by corruption, ethnic strife and abuse of basic rights. Hainworth played a very positive role in seeking to remove unnecessary causes of friction and looking for what commercial opportunities he could discern in this huge, potentially prosperous country. From Indonesia Hainworth moved to his last official appointment, as ambassador and representative to the disarmament conference in Geneva. The work was intellectually demanding even as the talks went nowhere, and Hainworth carried out his job, as all his others, with solid distinction.‚Äù Hainworth was appointed Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1961 and retired from the Diplomatic Service in 1974, later serving for eight years as chairman of the Anglo-Indonesian Society.

Most of the water in the aquifer comes from rain and melting snow that flows onto the plain from the Snake River, Big Lost River and other lost streams of Idaho, Bruneau River, and other watercourses of southern Idaho. Measuring about from east to west, it is an important water source for agricultural irrigation in the Plain. The Snake River Aquifer is commonly defined as two separate parts, separated by Salmon Falls Creek: the Eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer and Western Snake River Plain Aquifer. Eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer The Eastern Snake River Plain Aquifer north of the Snake River is a remarkable aquifer of great resource and economic significance. It is not a single homogeneous geologic formation. Rather it consists of a volcanic pile of the Quaternary Snake River Group basalts. In eastern Idaho, these basalts may be about thick. The individual flows are thick with the upper consisting of a very permeable rubble zone. Interbedded alluvial sediments are also found between many of the flows. In the eastern Snake River Plain, the Snake River lies near the southern edge of the plain, about southeast of the ranges of central Idaho. The rivers in the ranges north of the plain all disappear into the surface of the Snake River Plain near the mountain front. The Little Lost River is a typical example. For about 100 miles downstream from Milner Dam in the vicinity of Twin Falls an estimated total volume of approximately of water enter the Snake River from gigantic springs on the north side of the canyon. This is the well-known Thousand Springs area. Groundwater flows to the southwest through the Snake River Plains aquifer which is consistent with the overall tilt to the southwest of the basalt strata.

The flow of the prose is anachronistic, often jumping from life in America to life in Vietnam, at times even to a time in Vietnam before the narrator's birth. The tenses also switch from present tense to past and back. The novel is also told episodically fractured, because as the author stated, \\"memory, by its nature, is very fragmented\\".th√∫y, l√™ thi diem. \\"Fragments of Memory.\\" Far East Economic Review. 11 March 2004.

Also, Le is good at using descriptive sentences and providing vivid details to draw images and scenes for readers. When the little girl thinks back about the swimming pool, Le emphasizes a lot of small things with a series of ‚ÄúI remember...‚Äù to make the paragraph rhythmic and thought-provoking (Le 54). Details like the bouncing ball and the fluttering sheets are dramatic flashbacks, which encourage readers to imagine the surroundings, in which the tragedy happens. Themes & Symbols Water Throughout the novel, water is the most prominent motif. From the beginning, l√™ thi diem th√∫y inserts that ‚ÄúIn Vietnamese, the word for water and the word for a nation, a country, and a homeland are one and the same: nu‚Äô√≥‚Äôc.‚ÄùThe reason why water is so important for Vietnamese is that Vietnam is a country that is surrounded by water. They live beside the water for generations. Si it is can be said that water is a holy thing for Vietnamese. In a similar sense, water plays a symbolic role in diverse ways in the text‚Äî-often, with dual/opposite meanings. Most of the themes within the text are somehow related to and entwined with the flow of water. Except for water, the palm is also an important symbol in the book to symbolize the hometown. The palm is mentioned for many times in the book because both Vietnam and California is tropical area In fact, she always consciously and unconsciously seeks out the dead brothers to heal the trauma caused by the loss of her sibling. The representations of water are prominent symbolically and literally throughout the novel which also reflect narrator‚Äôs action after her brother‚Äôs death. Water connected Vietnam and her brother's death.  Repression  The narrator was constantly haunted by her brother' s image ‚ÄúAs she directed the eye of the camera back to the grass, she kept crying because of what it could not see and what she could not stop seeing.‚Äù(The Gangster 19) The repression memory on the conscious become a consistency imagination in narrator's mind. People will intend not to see the cruel fact, but it still exist. If the death is hide from others, they search is never end. \\"The denial and repression only increase the narrator's determination to obtain the affirmation of the brother's death. \\" Prior to that, she imagines that her brother is alive and is around her. The Mobility of Memory through the PhotographGsoels- Lorensen, Gutta. ‚Äúl√™ thi diem th√∫y‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Gangster We Are All Looking For‚Äô: The Ekphrastic Emigration of a Photograph.‚Äù Studies in Contemporary Fiction. Volume 48, Number 4 / Summer 2007. Print. Through the photograph, The Gangster We Are All Looking For explores the nature of memory and its ability, or inability, to travel from generation to generation. In le's narrative, the photograph can be understood not only in terms of reference and time, but also ‚Äúperspective of mobility\\".  The Mobility of Behaviors through walking and wandering  The image of water not only symbolizes their nation, Vietnam and open sea, but also shows their flexibility of their behaviors and actions, to assimilate the social activities. Chen illustrates their actions to‚Äúuse physical mobility to discover their host society and to validate their existence through their bipedal adventures as active diasporic subjects‚Äù (13). Their actions to be involved in new community are as fluid as water. Her father helps her hold an advisable attitude after moving in a new land, rather than finding ways to return. More than that, their mobility on their identifications as Vietnamese Americans makes them walk and wander and find their ways to fit into the society. This quality of their identifications also causes the daughter to move around and live away from her parents. =‚ÄúArrival 1: Listening to the Mortified Eloquence of the Photograph‚Äù= From the beginning, the photograph is not presented as an object to be viewed, but as a force which disturbs the narrator's somewhat settled family. Although the photograph is not accompanied with text or a written message, to the mother, the picture is a demand, a message which tells of a time when the mother had been disowned. Because the photograph is loaded with deep emotion and grief for the mother, ‚Äúshe loses herself, literally her self, to it entirely‚Äù (8). But for the daughter, who does not associate much experience with the photograph, the picture does not offer any sort of access. =‚ÄúArrival 2: (At)Tending to the Split Photograph‚Äù= Treating the photograph as if it was an actual immigrant, Ma tells the narrator that the photograph has come to move in. The narrator's response is: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know what she is talking about but I say ‚ÄòO.K.‚Äô anyway,‚Äù suggesting the alienation and challenge of intergenerational remembering. Because the photograph is addressed towards the mother, the mother recognizes herself as the child, the grandparents as the parents. Since the mother is taking on the role of the child, she dislodges the identity of the narrator. Because the mother perceives the photograph as addressed towards herself, the photograph offers no connection to the narrator. Actually, it dislocates the narrator from her identity. ‚ÄúThe mother becomes a ‚Äòchild,‚Äô the father a ‚Äògangster,‚Äô and the daughter confronts the multiple voids of a vacated identity\\" (10). Because the daughter is incapable of interpreting or connecting to the photograph, since it was taken before she was born, her only option is to engage in a close examination which results in empty meaning. Lorensen states that the ‚Äúdaughter‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ relation to the family portrait from Vietnam [is] the mad dance before the entire neighborhood.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe daughter‚Äôs mad dance could be viewed as a theatrical examination of a photograph that refuses to have meaning for her‚Äù (11). Lorensen claims that although the daughter can not see the photograph the way her mother does, she still recognizes its ability to disintegrate her family, the way her own body ‚Äúdissolves‚Äù (12) as she dances in front of the entire neighborhood. =‚ÄúArrival 3: The Second Death of the Photographic Subject as the Catalytic Mark of Signification‚Äù= Lorensen also suggests that the since the photograph has come to represent the grandparents, when the family is evicted from their Linda Vista home, leaving behind the photograph, two types of ‚Äúevictions‚Äù take place, the eviction from Linda Vista in America, and another one from the past, when the mother is evicted, or disowned, from her family in Vietnam. Although this may seem like an extravagant interpretation, the details of the narration suggest otherwise. There are two descriptions which link both evictions together. The description of the chain- link fence and the calling of each other's names, which are present in both \\"evictions\\". At the end, the mother calls out for her parents, which she's forgotten. This has a double meaning. She's calling for her home in Vietnam, to return to Vietnam, as well as the photographs she's forgotten at her Linda Vista home. The Textual Representation of a Visual Representation (Ekphrasticism) Through le's language, to the narrator and to the American reader, the photograph's meaning slides from being the grandparents to being ‚ÄúVietnam.‚Äù This is due to le's language in introducing the photograph as ‚ÄúVietnam is a black-and-white photograph of [‚Ä¶]‚Äù (78) which invokes other images of black-and-white photographs regarding Vietnam that the collective American memory may recall such as the photograph of a girl running from a napalm strike or the close range shooting of a Viet Cong suspect.Gsoels- Lorensen, Gutta. ‚Äúl√™ thi diem th√∫y‚Äôs ‚ÄòThe Gangster We Are All Looking For‚Äô: The Ekphrastic Emigration of a Photograph‚ÄùStudies in Contemporary Fiction. Volume 48, Number 4 / Summer 2007. Print Loss of Brother The narrator loses her brother during her family immigrated from Vietnam to the U.S. In this book, sibling bereavement affects the narrator‚Äôs mental condition during her childhood. Firstly, ‚Äúsocial withdrawal and limited friendships have been found as distal correlates to sibling death in several studies‚Äù (Garlie), which can be reflected in her role as an observer bu not a participator at school and has limited friends (Le 19). In addition, she often feels differently than others or even has delusion when seeing the butterfly in the glass disk and her feelings are so delicate that she is always trying to free the butterfly in the glass disk(Le 25). What's more, she is dying for being intimate with ‚Äúthe boy‚Äù, which is narrated in fragments for many times. Actually, she is always looking for her dead brother, both consciously and unconsciously, the reason is because her PTSD‚Äîpost traumatic stress disorder. PTSD is an ‚Äúoverwhelming experience of sudden or catastrophic events in which the response to the event occurs in the often uncontrolled, repetitive appearance of hallucinations and other intrusive phenomena‚Äù (3). The narrator's unconscious mind constantly reminds her of her brother, who she often fantasizes about as if he were still alive and acts with strange performances as if he were right there with her. This shows that the death of her elder brother had a very negative influence on the narrator, and it even affects her mental state gradually. The loss of brother leads to unconscious development of defense mechanism in narrator's mind, thus prompting her to take actions to escape difficulties in later immigrant life. The narrator‚Äôs unconscious defense mechanism is embodied in her selective memory of her dead brother. ‚ÄúSelective memory means modifying our memories so that we don 't feel overwhelmed by them or forgetting painful events entirely‚Äù (Tyson). So when the narrator thinks of her brother, she often thinks about the beautiful memories of getting along with him.As narrator illustratesinthe book: ‚ÄúI could lean back, I could close my eyes and fall down a flight of stairs or off the second-floor railing, and he would be there to catch me; I was certain of it‚Äù (Le 74). When she feels lonely in America, she thinks of playing games with her brother. She feels that this happy memory will enable her to solve the difficulties of loneliness. The narrator's brother protects her like a guardian angel, so she trusts him and feels warmth from him. Selectively remembering her brother is her unconscious defense mechanism to deal with her grief. She refuses to remember how her brother died and what resulted in his death because she is trying to make herself forget the painful memory.  The Connection of Father-and-daughter  The nameless girl always knows clearly she wants to be a person like her father. She aims to be \\"the gangster [they] are all looking for\\" (Le 93) and she is certain she sees her future in him (116). Her father affects her; not only is she alike to him by their biographical relations but also because of his enlightening and his accompanying. And when Le talked about the gangster formally for the first time, it is her father. Her father used to be a member of gangster and a Buddhist. Le‚Äôs mother didn‚Äôt know that at first and dated with him secretly. She gradually found the truth after she was married. B ut after the entire family moved into America, no one else knew about that fact. Though her father always acts like the gangster, violently and losing control, she wants to be this kind of person as a hero in front of her. It is her father who adapts the new environment actively with her. It is her father who keeps company with her and builds shadow for her. As a six-year-old girl, all her knowledge is derived from her father. When she has no one to rely on except her father, the unconscious belief of becoming the kind of person who gives others safety and enlightenment implies what her father has given to her and protected her. On the night they left Vietnam,‚Äúit was her father who carried [her] down to the beach and placed [her] on the fishing boat. During the hours that must have been ones of fear, anxiety, and desperation, [her] only memory is of how calmly [she] sat waiting for him‚Äù(105). It is her father who protects her from homelessness. He is the last straw she could hold on to. Also, the tie of father-and-daughter is crucial because father can affect the stability of children;s relations with others and the sense of security, as well as some‚Äúsocial skills, behavior problems, motivation‚Äùand‚Äúcognitive performances‚Äù(Cabrera 122). Her father consolidates her cognition, builds her whole world and gives her sense of security.  Geopolitics  Geopolitics \\"refers to the involvement of geography and politics in an international framework\\", this term \\"has been used by scholars to gesture toward the entanglement of nationality and transnationality in diverse localities\\" (Liu). Frequently switching the places where things happened discontinuously to tell stories, as refugees or outsiders, helps to provide a fragmented and displaced context. Le makes use of the alternate scenes between Vietnam and the United States, and the alternated times between past and present in The Gangster We Are All Looking For, to piece the narrator‚Äôs memory which maps the fragmentation. The storyteller, a six-year-old girl, describes how ‚Äúa Catholic schoolgirl from the South‚Äù and ‚Äúa Buddhist gangster from the North‚Äù meet and fall in love, and where they give birth to her in Vietnam in the third chapter of this book (Le 79). She relates the metaphor as told by her mother to reflect that the war pains this family a lot, and it is like a bird that they can‚Äôt get rid of, flies with this family all the time and never stops hurting from Vietnam to the United States (Le 87). Later in this chapter, she makes a turn that focuses on the life they have in the yellow house in California while her family has to move out again like they had to leave Vietnam as refugees (Le 88).  Palm  Palm most commonly refers to: * Palm of the hand, the central region of the front of the hand * Palm trees, of family Arecaceae As one of the softest part of human body, the narrator uses it to seek and observe things. Through touching and feeling things by her palm, what she feels are more factual and sensitive. When she is going to bring the ice bag to her mom, the melting ice bag reminds her of her died brother. Since ‚Äúthe fingertips [are] wrinkled with cold, as if [she]‚Äôd been swimming for hours‚Äù (Le 77), her palm is stimulated because of the physical response. This depiction that symbolizes the frozen memory of her brother also begins to emerge. What is more, \\"palm\\" is also a kind of tree that pervades in the whole story. It seems that this tree records everything happened on this immigrant family as a documentary. The existence of palm in the United States is as symbolic as the meaning of water to Vietnam. Palm is very common in the United States, just like seeing water in the author's consciousness can think of hometown Vietnam. \\"When they cut away the plastic, what we saw was a squat baby palm tree\\"(Le 53). In this section, the landlord took the water out of the pool and planted a palm to represent the replacement. The water, the swimming pool, the only one connection with the narrator's hometown she believed has disappeared, and replaced by a baby palm. This shows that she was also forced to integrate into the new environment.  Conspiracy Silence  There is a ‚Äúcommunicative disruption‚Äù (Ha 4) between her and her father, ‚Äúwater moving through a reed pipe in the middle of a sad tune. And the voice is always asking and answering itself‚Äù (Le 10). Her father never shares his past or what he has experienced with his family members. He always chooses to be silent or cry alone. In this case, ‚ÄúBa‚Äù is trapped in his unsolved traumatic memories, which obstructs him keep going. According to Ha‚Äôs analysis, Ba ‚Äúfears being overwhelmed by his past, but his inability to transcend that past holds it as an ever-present obsession‚Äù (Ha 5), which reveals ‚ÄúBa‚Äù still in the conflicts between past pain and present suffering. His emotion shows his lost in self-identity. It is obvious that ‚ÄúBa‚Äù doesn‚Äôt know how to get over the original trauma to adapt to a new cultural life. Reception Le's novel received wide acclaim through a multitude of book reviews ranging from Entertainment Weekly to The New York Times to Publishers Weekly.

Studying in Aomori and Yokohama in his hospital, he wrote a book Leprosy and Social Problems in 1907, the year of the promulgation of the first leprosy law, and openly criticized the crucial segregation policy. He advocated the nation's involvement in the discovery of treatments of leprosy, since he believed that it was curable. Personal history He was born on November 25, 1872 in Kuradatemura (now Owanimachi) Aomori Prefecture. After graduation from Tokyo Saisei Gakusha, a private medical school, in 1898 he studied leprosy in Aomori Prefecture at Masuda Hospital where his brother was practicing. In 1904, he presented two patients who recovered with his treatment before a medical meeting in Aomori. In 1906 he moved to Yokohama and studied the treatment of leprosy. In 1907, he published \\"Leprosy and Social Problems\\" and criticized the 1907 segregation leprosy prevention law. In 1913, he moved to Asakusa, Tokyo and specialized in venereal disease. In 1945, he died amid the great Tokyo air raid. Presentation of Patients before a meeting A newspaper ToOo Nippou, recorded his presentation. After the general meeting of Aomori Prefecture Physicians in the morning, \\"Isamu Masuda presented two patients who recovered well with his remedy and told them the story of his treatment.\\" Leprosy and social problems From Aomori he moved to Yokohama, where leprosy patients gathered. He studied leprosy patients while practicing dermatology and venereology. In 1907 he published the results of his studies and his opinions in Leprosy and Social Problems. Based on his experiences, he firmly believed that leprosy was curable, and he was against indiscriminate segregation. The leprosy policy should be based on humanity and the state should order that specialists study the treatments of leprosy. Patients may be willing to be hospitalized if leprosy will be curable within 5 years. His opinions were not accepted by the Government and the publication of his book was impossible. Only one copy was left in the National Diet Library. His Remedy His remedy was from plants and was served in powder and injections. Because his remedy was not perfect, he did not make his medicine public. He wrote that 34 out of 100 patients recovered. Kitasato Shibasabur≈ç, a noted physician of his time, reported that only 4 cured and 15 almost cured out of 233 patients, according to Leprosy and Social Problems.

The band were disbanded in 2014. Background The band formed in 2005 in Washington, D.C. by three members of the short-lived Olney, MD, band Fell off the Face of the Earth: Dan Scheuerman (lead vocals and guitar), Matt Dowling (bass, keyboards, guitar and backing vocals), and Dominic Campanaro (guitar and keyboards). Ricardo Lagomasino (drums) joined in 2012, replacing Brian Hospital. The art rock style of Deleted Scenes is, according to Lane Billings of Paste Magazine, \\"nearly impossible to categorize,\\" combining elements of rock, punk, avant- guarde, pop, noise, psych, math rock, and Americana. Frontman Dan Scheuerman contributes confessional, poetic lyrics to the songs. In January 2009, Deleted Scenes' debut album Birdseed Shirt came out on Brooklyn label What Delicate Recordings. It was engineered in part by J. Robbins and produced and mixed by L Skell. Pitchfork awarded the album with an 8.0, calling it \\"ferocious, brave, and a well-balanced demonstration of both thoughtful existentialism and strange, drowsy downers.\\" NPR noted its \\"playfully unpredictable songs that veer in unexpected directions while remaining completely infectious.\\" The title of the record was taken from Jonathan Safran Foer's novel Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close. In the fall of 2010, the band convened in a disused garden center in Hockessen, DE with Birdseed Shirt producer L. Skell and Nick Krill of The Spinto Band to record their second album, Young People's Church of the Air. The resulting album, released by Sockets Records in 2011 and re- released by Park the Van in 2012, \\"balances out the group's experimental impulses with an uncanny knack for pop hooks,\\" according to Paste. In his 7.8 review for Pitchfork, Aaron Leitko praised Scheuerman's \\"gift for distilling complex thought into everyday language\\".\\" In March 2013, Deleted Scenes began recording sessions in Philadelphia, PA with Brian McTear and Jon Low, a production duo who have worked with Kurt Vile, Sharon Van Etten, The War on Drugs, and The National. On December 29, 2014, the band announced their disbandment on their Facebook page, stating \\"We're done. Called it in August.

The LCC consisted of members from across the spectrum of former leading Latvian politicians and aimed to be the governing body after the war. Its military units were an alternative to the Soviet partisans also operating in Latvia.Geoffrey Swain, Latvia‚Äôs Democratic Resistance: a Forgotten Episode from the Second World War, European History Quarterly, No. 2, 2009. Latvia had gained its independence from Russia at the end of World War I, but in June 1940 the country was occupied by the Red Army and in August 1940 it was forcibly incorporated into the Soviet Union. In June 1941, Nazi Germany invaded the Soviet Union and by July of that year it had overrun Latvia and incorporated the country into Germany‚Äôs eastern empire. Latvians resisted both Soviet and German occupation and sought to restore their independence. The Latvian Central Council was founded on August 13, 1943 by members of the four biggest Latvian political parties- the Latvian Social Democratic Workers' Party, Democratic Centre, Latvian Farmers Union and the Latgalian Christian Farmers party. These men survived the Soviet terror and now strove to restore the democratic Republic of Latvia. Konstantƒ´ns ƒåakste was elected as the chairman with deputies Pauls Kalni≈Ü≈° and Ludvigs Sƒìja as general secretary. Seven commissions were made for most important sectors like defense, foreign affairs and finances.Latvian Resistance Against the Nazi Occupation. Latvianhistory.com On March 17, 1944, 189 Latvian political leaders and public figures signed the Memorandum of the Latvian Central Council, which declared the urgent need to restore the de facto sovereignty of the Republic of Latvia and create a Latvian government. The memorandum was a call to resist the reoccupation of Latvia by the Soviet Union following the defeat of Germany, which by that time was widely expected. The memorandum was drawn up in several original copies and photographically reproduced with the aim of taking it out of Latvia and getting it into the hands of the governments of the Western allies and the German occupation government. On 8 September 1944 in Riga, the leadership of the Latvian Central Council adopted a Declaration on the restoration of the State of Latvia.Edgars Andersons, Leonƒ´ds Sili≈Ü≈° ‚ÄúLatvijas CentrƒÅlƒÅ padome ‚Äì LCP‚Äù ‚Äî LCP, Upsala 1994. The adoption of the Declaration was an attempt to restore de facto independence of the Republic of Latvia, in hopes of international support and by taking advantage of the interval between changes of occupying powers. The Declaration prescribed that the Satversme is the fundamental law of the restored Republic of Latvia, and provided for establishment of a Cabinet of Ministers that would organise the restoration of the State of Latvia. Some of the most prominent LCC accomplishments are related to its military branch ‚Äì General JƒÅnis Kurelis group (the so-called ‚Äúkurelie≈°i‚Äù) with Lieutenant Roberts Rubenis battalion which carried out the armed resistance against Waffen SS forces. Moreover, LCC helped Latvians escape to Sweden by boat in 1943-45 from Courland in Western Latvia, thereby rescuing thousands including Jews.The national resistance movement during WWII the ‚ÄúLatvian Central Council‚Äù turns 70 On 3 October 1945 the Latvian Central Council in Lustenau (Austria) held its first meeting . After the death of Dr. Pauls Kalni≈Ü≈° on 27 August 1945, the chairing of the CC Latvia was undertaken by Bishop JƒÅzeps RancƒÅns, the former Deputy Speaker of the Latvian Parliament. The CC Latvia comprised the officials of the Presidium of the Parliament and the largest parties of the pre-war Latvia, its headquarters were located in Esslingen.Latvian Central Council The LCC prepared several petitions and memorandums on the policies of the Bolshevik and Nazi occupation powers in Latvia and submitted them to the governments of the important western powers. Bishop J. RancƒÅns and other LCC members repeatedly visited American and British occupation authorities in Germany to achieve improvement of the situation of former Latvian soldiers and refugees. Authorised by the LCC, they arrived at international conferences where the arrangement of the post-war Europe was decided, to unofficially inform the representatives of western powers on issues related to the Latvian state and its citizens. The Latvian Central Council established contacts with Lithuanian and Estonian political organisations to apply common efforts in the fight against the occupation regime in the Baltic States.

The main task of the People‚Äôs Council was to draw up a constitution on the basis of a draft presented by the SED in 1946. First people's council Meeting of the first People's Council, March 1949 The First German People's Council emerged from the Second German People's Congress convened on 17-18 March 1948. It consisted of 300 voting members of the Soviet Occupation Zone. At the inaugural meeting of a further 100 people had been co-opted from the Western zones in order to underscore the overall German claim. The organization of the People's Council was similar to that of a parliament (even though it lacked the legitimacy of an election) and elected a Presidium and committees. In a point of order, the bourgeois parties put emphasis on the finding that the prior People's Council should be parliament, the SED attempted to portray it as a pan-German Parliament.SBZ-Handbuch, Seite 321-322 The selection of members of the People's Council had insured that the SED would have a large majority. The SED also provided 153 of the deputies coming from the Soviet Zone. Added to this were the members of mass organizations affiliated the SED. CDU (55 members) and Liberal Democratic Party (56 members) possessed more than 111 seats. Also, in the Executive Committee and all committees, the SED had absolute majorities. The SED also questioned the committee chairs (except for the Judiciary Committee (Liberal Democrats) and the Committee for a peace treaty (CDU). Later came to the CDU nor the Committee on agricultural issues. Constitutional committee In the People's Council, a constitutional committee was formed that would develop under the leadership of Otto Grotewohl (SED) as a condition of the German Democratic Republic. Here, the Committee would be based on a draft of the SED already developed in November 1946. The draft was drawn up by the Committee on 22 October 1948 approved by the People's Council and on 19 March 1949 formally adopted. The proposal was then referred to the Third German People's Congress for approval. Second people's council The Second German People's Council was selected from the Third German People's Congress, at 29-30. Convened in May 1949. It appeared on 7 October 1949 together, during the Declaration of the German Democratic Republic, and constituted itself as a provisional parliament of the GDR. The People's Council commissioned the former Social Democrat Otto Grotewohl with forming a government. Thus the founding of the GDR had been completed.

Back That Fact was broadcast from New York City.  Game play  At the beginning of the show, a panel of judges was chosen from members of the studio audience. Then the emcee would interview another member of the audience about that person's life, family, job, hobbies and other parts of their background. If at any time during the interview the contestant made a positive assertion on an answer, the announcer would interrupt and ask the player to \\"Back That Fact\\". At that point, the player would attempt to prove, to the best of their ability, that the assertion was true. The judges would then decide if the player successfully justified or verified their explanation. If the judges agreed, the player won a modest prize.

This eliminates or reduces the need for an additional energy dissipator, such as a body of water, at the end of the spillway downstream. Historical developments Stepped spillways, consisting of weirs and channels, have been used for over 3,500 years since the first structures were built in Greece and Crete. During Antiquity, the stepped chute design was used for dam spillways, storm waterways, and in the town water supply channels. Most of these early structures were built around the Mediterranean Sea, and the expertise on stepped spillway design was spread successively by the Romans, Muslims and Spaniards. Although the early stepped spillways were built in cut-stone masonry, unlined rock and timber, a wider range of construction materials was introduced during the mid-19th century, including the first concrete stepped spillway of the Gold Creek dam (1890) in Brisbane, Australia. During the first half of the 20th century, the stepped cascade design became out of fashion, partly because of the maintenance costs but also because of the development in hydraulic jump stilling basins. Yet the long-lasting operation of several famous stepped cascades has demonstrated the soundness of the stepped spillway design. Although the stepped spillway design was common up to the beginning of the 20th century, a lot of expertise has been lost since, and the present expertise is limited to very simple geometries, namely some flat horizontal stepped prismatic chutes, despite some recent interest in stepped spillway design. Basic flow characteristics The flow over a stepped spillway may be divided into three distinct flow regimes depending upon the flow rate for a given stepped spillway geometry: nappe, transition and skimming flow regimes with increasing flow rates. For a given stepped spillway geometry, the nappe flows are observed for small discharges. They are characterized by a succession of free-falling nappes at each step edge, followed by nappe impact on the following step. The transition flows are observed for a range of intermediate discharges. Some strong hydrodynamic fluctuations, splashing and spray near the free surface constitute the main features of this flow regime. To date, the transition flow is avoided for design flow conditions because of past failures. The skimming flow regime is observed for the largest discharges. The waters skim over the pseudo-bottom formed by the step edges as a coherent turbulent flow. Beneath the pseudo- bottom some intense recirculation and vertical structures fill the cavities. These recirculation eddies are maintained by the transmission of shear stress from the mainstream and they contribute significantly to the energy dissipation down the stepped spillway. For a small dam, the nappe flow is considered most efficient in terms of energy dissipation, while the skimming flow is most efficient for long spillway chutes and large dams. Discussion Gabion stepped weirs are commonly used for embankment protection, river training and flood control; the stepped design enhances the rate of energy dissipation in the channel, and it is particularly well-suited to the construction of gabion stepped weirs. For very low flow, a porous seepage flow regime may be observed, when the water seeps through the gabion materials and there is no overflow past the step edges.

During the war, government forces carried out disappearances, estimated at 1,200, systematic torture, and \\"probable extrajudicial executions\\". The judicial investigation into State crimes against political movements was not opened until the end of the 71-year long PRI regime and the accession to power of Vicente Fox in 2000, which created the Special Prosecutor's Office for Social and Political Movements of the Past (FEMOSPP). However, despite revealing much about the history of the conflict, the FEMOSPP has not been able to finalize prosecutions against the main instigators of the Dirty War.http://catarina.udlap.mx/u_dl_a/tales/documentos/lri/garcia_r_d/capitulo2.pdf In March 2019, the President of Mexico, Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador, publicly released the archives of the defunct Federal Security Directorate, which contain a great amount of previously undisclosed information about the Dirty War and the political persecution by the PRI governments in the 20th century. L√≥pez Obrador stated that \\"We lived for decades under an authoritarian regime which limited freedoms and persecuted those who struggled for social change\\" and issued an official apology on behalf of the Mexican State towards the victims of the repression. L√≥pez Obrador further stated that judicial action will be taken against the surviving perpetrators of the repression, and promised that the surviving victims will be able to claim compensation under the law. Events Poster denouncing the forced disappearance of Felix Barrientos Campos, arrested on July 5, 1975 in Acapulco (Guerrero, Mexico) and whose whereabouts are unknown until the date of the poster's placement in 2010. The announcement was placed in the Alameda Central of Mexico City. The war was characterized by a backlash against the active student movement of the late 1960s which ended in the Tlatelolco massacre at a 1968 student rally in Mexico City, in which 30 to 300 (according to official reports; non- governmental sources claim death toll in the thousands) students were killed, and in the Corpus Christi massacre, another massacre of student demonstrators in Mexico City on June 10, 1971. There were several barely connected groups fighting against the government during this period. Among the most important, the September 23 Communist League was at the forefront of the conflict, active in several cities throughout Mexico, drawing heavily from Christian Socialist and Marxist student organizations. They carried out confrontations with Mexican security forces, several kidnappings, and attempted to kidnap Margarita L√≥pez Portillo, the sister of the president. In Guerrero, the Party of the Poor, ostensibly fighting against landholder impunity and oppressive police practices in rural areas, was led by the ex-teacher Lucio Caba√±as; they carried out ambushes of the army and security forces and the abduction of Guerrero's governor-elect. Cessation of hostilities The legalization of left-wing political parties in 1978 along with the amnesty of imprisoned and at large guerrillas caused a number of combatants to end militant struggle against the government. However, certain groups continued fighting, and the National Human Rights Commission states the hostilities continued into 1982. In June 2002, a report prepared for Vicente Fox, the first president not from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) in 71 years, detailed the government's actions from 1964 to 1982. The report states, according to BBC News, that the Mexican army \\"kidnapped, tortured, and killed hundreds of rebel suspects\\" in the period and accused the Mexican state of genocide. The Mexican Special Prosecutor claimed the report was overly biased against the military and that it failed to detail crimes committed by rebels, including kidnappings, bank robberies, and assassinations. However, general consensus is that the report accurately assessed the government's culpability. Instead of ensuring the security of innocent civilians, it victimized them and killed them alike.  Guerrilla groups  The year 1960 marked the beginning of a decade of terror in the region of Guerrero as the state slowly began to deal with the citizens and peasants there ever-more violently. The state enacted the acts of suppression on Guerrero to keep the numerous different political reform movements stifled, as the local people over time grew agitated with the way the government was wielding its power and meddling with their rights. As the citizens grew more determined to speak out against the government in the 1960s, the PRI continued to increase its terror tactics in the region. While that was done to keep the populace under its control, the constant stream of violence pushed many guerrillas to consider raising up arms against the PRI. The rising of guerrilla groups in the 1960s and 1970s provided the state an excuse to focus its resources on suppressing the armed activities of the guerrillas. The army would become infamous for its tactics in repressing the rebels in the rural areas of Mexico, where such practices such as the death flights were initiated. This period of state violence in the state of Guerrero helped to bring about numerous guerrilla organizations. One of the groups was the Party of the Poor (PDLP), which was influenced by Marxism and people like Che Guevara. That group tended to be focused more on the rural regions like Guerrero, where they would be more likely to find support among the peasants there. The PDLP actions become more violent towards the rich after events such as the 1967 Atoyac massacre, where leaders like Lucio Caba√±as tried to use the peasants anger to bring about true revolution. As the 1960s and 1970s would go on, the PDLP would gain attention around the nation for acts like its kidnapping of Ruben Figueroa who was a prominent leader of the PRI. While this act inspired those downtrodden by the government, this also marked the decline of the organization as the government began to focus more on taking out this guerrilla group. Eventually the army found and killed Caba√±as on December 2, 1974 in an attempt to cause his movement to fall apart. Another school teacher turned revolutionary, Genaro V√°zquez Rojas, founded the National Revolutionary Civic Association (ACNR) as a response to the governments actions in Guerrero. These two leaders and their movements emerged as the armed phase of this social struggle against a corrupt government, which would continue long after the deaths of the leaders.  Torture  Torture was one of the many tools used by the PRI-run state in its drive to keep the numerous guerrilla groups and political dissidents repressed. While torture was illegal in many countries during this time, the numerous authoritarian regimes that sprung up from the Cold War used it to great effect. The Mexican state used torture to get information from captured rebels and guerrillas about attacks and plans. This torturing would be done at any number of clandestine detention centers, where guerrillas would be sent to before arriving at a legal prison so as the state's activities would be kept secret from outside sources. Typically both male and female guerrilla prisoners would be tortured at these areas. It was more common for women to be sexually assaulted by their guards. This, combined with other forms of physical and psychological gender-based transgressions leads some to believe that the state employed this form of gender policing to try and deter women from breaking the regimes social and political norms. The detaining and torturing of political prisoners became more systematic after the student uprisings in 1968, for the government decided that heavy-handed responses were necessary to deal with the unrest. This stage of violent and public repression of differing ideals was similar to the regimes of the Southern Cone governments, such as Argentina.  Aftermath  While Mexico's Dirty War has been over for several years, not much is known of the extent of the number of victims the war claimed, due to its elusive nature throughout its length. Part of the reason for this problem is that since there was no large-scale truth commission to bring justice to the perpetrators and closure for the victim's families, Mexico never had its \\"Pinochet moment\\" in regards to the war. From the early 2000s onward, some local investigations have been carried out by NGOs, providing some insight into the tactics and dynamics of the war, as well as the scale of crimes. One example, conducted by the Association of Relatives of Victims of Disappearance, Detention and Human Rights Violations in Mexico (AFADEM) documented over 470 disappearances at the hands of state forces during the 1970s just in the municipality of Atoyac. Another problem was the lack of response in the wake of the 2006 report by Carillo Prieto, which documented some of the atrocities inflicted by the PRI regime. Despite this evidence of numerous crimes that violated human rights, ex-president Echeverria and several other PRI officials had their cases dismissed and became free men. The failure by the government to address these problems of the past has been a cause of tension at times in Mexico, as citizens become distrustful of a state that does not address the old regime and its reign of terror.

In Michigan's 15‚Äì6 win over Minnesota in 1909, Magidsohn scored both of Michigan's touchdowns, including a run for a touchdown in the first half and a interception return for a touchdown in the second half. =1909 football season= The 1909 season marked the first time that any school from the \\"West\\" defeated one of the \\"Big Four\\" eastern schools, as Michigan defeated Penn by a score of 12‚Äì6 in Philadelphia. Penn came into the 1909 Michigan game with a 23-game winning streak in which they had allowed their opponents only 44 points. Magidsohn scored both of Michigan's touchdowns in the 1909 win over the Penn, including a touchdown reception from Allerdice and a run around Penn's right end for a touchdown. Magidsohn later said of the Penn game: \\"That 1909 Michigan-Penn game is the one I regard as my greatest... My All-America teammate, halfback and captain, Dave Allerdice, had a broken left hand so I was obliged to do most of the ball carrying.\\" At the end of the 1909 season, eastern football expert Walter Camp selected both of Michigan's halfbacks (Magidsohn and Allerdice) as a second-team All-Americans. Both Michigan halfbacks were also picked by Walter Eckersall as first-team selections for his All-Western team. =1910 football season= Magidsohn from the 1910 Michigan football team photograph In 1910, Magidsohn started all six games at left halfback for an undefeated Michigan team (3‚Äì0‚Äì3) that outscored its opponents 29‚Äì9. Following Michigan's win over Syracuse in November 1910, the press called Magidsohn, who scored both of Michigan's touchdowns, the \\"Star of the Game\\" and noted that \\"his plunges were one of the features of the game.\\" At the end of the 1910 season, Magidsohn was chosen by at least a dozen selectors as a first-team member of the 1910 College Football All-America Team. He was also selected by E.C. Patterson as a first-team All-Western halfback in 1910. During Magidsohn's two seasons on the Michigan football team, the Wolverines lost only one game. =First Jewish letter winner at Michigan= Magidsohn was the first Jew to win an \\"M\\", the varsity letter awarded to competitors on the University of Michigan's varsity sports teams. After Magidsohn broke the barrier, other Jewish football players starred for Michigan, including All- Americans Benny Friedman, Harry Newman, Merv Pregulman and Dan Dworsky. According to several publications on Jews in sports, Magidsohn was the first athlete known to have refused to play on the Jewish High Holy Days. Magidsohn later recalled that Coach Yost \\"reluctantly excused me from workouts for two days to attend Rosh Hashanah services.\\" When teammates learned that Magidsohn had gotten two days off for the Holy Days, several reportedly responded, \\"Next year I'm going to be a Jew.\\" Later years After graduating from Michigan, Magidsohn served as a Big Ten Conference football official from 1912 to 1946 and was often assigned to officiate at many of the sport's biggest events, including the Army‚ÄìNavy Game, the Rose Bowl, and the College All-Star Game. In a World War I draft registration card completed in June 1917, Magidsohn stated that he was a naturalized United States citizen residing in Chicago, working as a civil engineer, and married with one child.Ancestry.com, on-line database of World War I Draft Registration Cards, 1917-1918, card completed by Joe Magidsoh, born December 20, 1888, in Tukun, Russia, completed on June 5, 1917. At the time of the 1920 U.S. Census, Magidsohn was listed as a civil engineer residing in Chicago with his wife Jennie (n√©e, Golden), age 30, son Elliot, age 5, and daughter Dorothy (age 2 years, 1 month).1920 United States Federal Census [database on-line]; Census Place: Chicago Ward 25, Cook (Chicago), Illinois; Roll: T625_341; Page: 15; Enumeration District: 1435; Image: 1081. Magidsohn was one of the organizers of Knollwood Country Club, its first secretary and its second president. He was also a former president of the Men's Club of Temple Beth El and served on the board for six years. He also served on the boards of the Jewish Community Center and the University of Michigan Alumni Association. Hall of fame He was inducted into the International Jewish Sports Hall of Fame in 1999.

This syndrome is a rare subcategory of autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI). It is associated with complications in the mid- trimester of a pregnancy leading to premature births. Although most prevalent in individuals of Scandinavian origin, there have also been scattered cases in people of Japanese, Italian and Indian ethnicity. This disorder is also referred to as ichthyosis congenital type IV.  Signs and symptoms  Eosinophils in peripheral blood The symptoms associated with the disorder are often confused for other dermatological disorders. The symptoms below are ones specifically associated with IPS.  Premature birth  Pregnancies that have a foetus affected with this syndrome are complicated because of polyhydramnion. Complications arise because of opaque amnionic fluid resulting from the shedding of skin. As a result, ultrasounds are difficult to conduct. Triggered by the harsh environment in the uterus, delivery results around 30‚Äì 34 weeks of gestation (pregnancy) and the baby is born in prematurely.  Thick caseous layer of skin  A white layer of thick scaly substance covers the surface of the skin of the infant. This is characterized by aggregating membranes in the upper layer of skin on epidermal cells.  Desquamating skin  Red endemic skin as well as spongy and desquamating (peeling) skin are consistent with this syndrome.  Respiratory problems  After premature delivery, the baby often has neonatal asphyxia from breathing amnionic debris mainly composed of shedding skin cells. Neonatal refers to the very young infant and amniotic fluid refers to the liquid environment the baby is bathed in inside the uterus.  Eosinophilia  Eosinophils are a kind of a white blood cell which help protect the body from certain infections and involved in allergic responses. Eosionphelia is an abnormal increase of eosinophils in tissue, blood or both and is present in individuals born with this syndrome. Genetics  Mode of inheritance  This rare syndrome is associated with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. The parents are classified as heterozygote carriers of the disease and the chance that the offspring will be affected is 25%. Both parents need to have the mutant allele in order to pass on the disease to their offspring and the offspring need to inherit both mutant alleles in order to express the disorder. an autosomal recessive pattern.  Genetic cause  IPS is caused by a number of mutations at different loci of the FATP4 gene. One nonsense mutation and a number of missense mutation in the FATP4 (SLC27A4) gene which codes for the fatty acid transport protein 4 are associated with IPS. Splice site mutations have also been linked to IPS. When the splice site between exons and introns is mutated, it leads to a deletion or duplication event which would change the stability or soundness of the protein the RNA is coding for. When a mutation is present in the gene coding for this protein, the protein product is not stable or able to perform its role. As a result, the pathway it is involved in is compromised and a diseased phenotype is often noted. In this particular case the fatty acid transport protein 4 is deformed due to the presence of mutations in the FATP4 gene and an interference occurs in the lipid metabolic pathway in the skin that this protein is involved with. This results in the abnormal formation of epidermal skin cells and a compromised formation and maintenance of an epidermal barrier. These underlying genetic causes explain the symptoms of the flaky, dry, cutaneous skin phenotype expressed. IPS genes segregate independently of the already known general ARCI locus. As a result, IPS has been identified to have its own gene locus making it easier to diagnose. Diagnosis Diagnosis can be made at birth by identifying the symptoms of the child. Ultrastructural diagnosis where tissues are analyzed is using electron microscopy is also conducted. A specimen of skin is obtained via a skin biopsy and analyzed to see any tell tale characteristics.Genetic testing can also be done to identify the mutation on the FATP4 gene associated with fatty acid synthesis. Genetic consultation through a genetic counsellor is done to determine whether the individual has this syndrome and reduces the chances of misdiagnoses with other cutaneous diseases. Treatment The infant is intubated post delivery to stabilize the respiratory problems experienced. Often the skin condition becomes less severe resolving itself to flaky dry skin as the individual grows. No intervention is usually required and the condition becomes less severe as the patient grows. The dry skin symptoms can be managed with topical ointments or creams and the individual remains otherwise healthy.  Prognosis  There are no life-threatening complications after the perinatal period (around the time of birth) and the skin conditions persist but to a lesser degree of severity. Individuals have a favourable prognosis as symptoms can be managed and past the infancy stage are not life-threatening. The red skin edema improves after a three-week period but the ichthyosis scaling persists. Asthma has been recorded in some cases later on in the individual's life and sign of atopic dermatitis persist, follicular hyperkeratosis and small amounts of scaling at the scalp that goes on into adulthood but otherwise the individual continues a healthy life. Epidemiology Frequencies of this disease are the greatest in Norway with a few Finnish cases have also having been noted to date. Some cases have been found in other ethnicities such as in people of Indian or Japanese descent as well as a north Italian family. These cases are scattered and there are potentially more under reported cases as this disease is often under diagnosed for other cutaneous diseases. It is most prevalent in a defined region in the middle of Norway and Sweden with a heterozygote carrier frequency of 1 in 50.

It was given in 1845 by Governor P√≠o Pico to Feliciano Soberanes.Ogden Hoffman, 1862, Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, Numa Hubert, San Francisco The grant derives its name from the secularized Mission Nuestra Se√±ora de la Soledad, but was called ex-Mission because of a division made of the lands held in the name of the Mission ‚Äî the church retaining the grounds immediately around, and all of the lands outside of this are called ex-Mission lands. The grant was adjacent Mission Soledad, west of the Salinas River and Soledad. History The Soberanes family patriarch, Jos√© Maria Soberanes (1753‚Äì1803) accompanied the Portola expedition to San Francisco Bay in 1769. Soberanes married Maria Josefa Castro (1759‚Äì1822) and received Rancho Buena Vista. Soberanes sons, Feliciano Soberanes (1788‚Äì1868) and Mariano Soberanes (1794‚Äì1859), were granted Rancho El Alisal in 1833. Feliciano Soberanes (1788‚Äì1868) was born in Monterey where he spent his whole life. He was regidor in 1829 and 1830, and then alcade at Monterey in 1838‚Äì1839. He married Maria Antonia Rodriguez (1795‚Äì1883) in 1810. Feliciano Soberanes was granted Rancho San Lorenzo in 1841. Feliciano's daughter, Maria Josefa Soberanes, was granted Rancho Los Coches in 1841. Feliciano's son, Francisco Maria Soberanes (1818‚Äì1887), was granted Rancho Sanjon de Santa Rita in 1841. Feliciano became administrator of Mission Soledad lands and received the two square league Rancho Ex-Mission Soledad in 1845. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Ex-Mission Soledad was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1853,United States. District Court (California : Southern District) Land Case 348 SD and the grant was patented to Feliciano Soberanes in 1874. Report of the Surveyor General 1844 - 1886 When Feliciano died in 1868, his son, Francisco Soberanes, acquired Rancho Ex-Mission Soledad, and later purchased the adjoining Rancho Paraje de Sanchez. Francisco Soberanes married Ysabel Boronda, daughter of Jos√© Manuel Boronda, grantee of Rancho Los Laureles. When Francisco Soberanes died in 1887, he left half of his estate to his widow, Ysabel Boronda Soberanes and the other half to his six surviving children. Shortly after the distribution of the estate under the will, the widow, Ysabel Bornoda Soberanes, transferred her entire share of the property to one son, Abel Soberanes, to the exclusion of the other five heirs. In 1891, Benito Soberanes, one of the other sons, petitioned to have the mother declared incompetent.

History Trains have historically been used by many global leaders and royalty, but particularly military leaders, due to their high speed, security and ability to accommodate extensive office and personal facilities within one mobile location. Kim Il-sung used a train during the Korean War as his headquarters, and continued the preference after the cessation of hostilities. He started the building of numerous secure palaces, many of which are either directly accessed by or close to railway stations, 19 of which it is estimated are accessed only by the private trains. Kim Jong-il's preference for the railroad transport was due to his fear of flying.Kim Jong-il rolls into Russia, BBC News website, 20 August 2002. Kim used the trains when he visited army units and factories, or traveled abroad. The private trains still serve a network of 19 stations across North Korea (including some underground palaces only accessible by rail). Operations The trains are usually pulled by two power units. It was reported in 2009 that Kim Jong-il made use of a fleet of six personal trains, which are made up of 90 armored luxury railcars. Each armoured train has modern communications equipment, such as satellite phones, enabling the leader to obtain briefings and issue orders while traveling. Security measures were increased after a 2004 explosion in Ryongchon near the border with China. The explosion, which was believed to have been caused by a train laden with oil and chemicals hitting power lines, occurred three hours after one of Kim's trains had passed through the area. This led to rumors that it might have been an assassination attempt. Now limited to , the private trains travel in groups of three: *The first running ahead to check the safety of railway lines *The middle one typically carries the leader, with a time delay of between 20 minutes and an hour after the first *A third train carries additional security staff, followers and communications equipment Once a train journey is confirmed, the area around the journey is cleared 24 hours before the three-train set travels. In December 2011, it was reported by North Korean television that Kim Jong-il died while on a train, during a domestic trip.

In March 2018, the Kim family's train was reportedly sighted in Beijing, which, along with heightened security around the Chinese government's Diaoyutai State Guesthouse led to speculation that Kim Jong-un and his wife Ri Sol-ju were visiting China. This was confirmed when they met with General Secretary of the Communist Party Xi Jinping and his wife Peng Liyuan. This marked the first time that North Korea's leader had left the country since taking the power in 2011.

He served until his defeat in the 2015 election. After his defeat in the 2015 election, Armstrong was appointed as the official opposition critic on Atlantic Canadian issues and ACOA and was the only official opposition critic who was not a member of parliament. On September 15, 2016, it was announced that Armstrong would be returning to full-time teaching and would relinquish his posts with the Conservative Party. Background Armstrong graduated from Cobequid Education Centre in 1984. He graduated from Acadia University with a Bachelor of Arts. He then went on to earn a Master of Social Science Education from Florida State University study at the University of Southern Mississippi as well. Armstrong has served as a school administrator for over 15 years. Armstrong was principal at Tatamagouche Elementary School in the early 2000s. He was also principal at Truro Elementary School in 2008 and 2009. After his election defeat in 2015 Armstrong returned to his career as an educator.

Armstrong is a former president and longstanding volunteer of the Progressive Conservative Party of Nova Scotia, and volunteer with the Conservative Party. Political career Following Bill Casey's resignation in April 2009, as the Member of Parliament for Cumberland-Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley, Armstrong was nominated as the Conservative Party candidate for the byelection to replace him. On November 9, 2009, Armstrong won the byelection, receiving 45.8% of the vote. He was re- elected in the 2011 federal election, receiving 52.5% of the vote. In September 2012, Armstrong was named chairman of the federal Conservative Atlantic caucus, replacing New Brunswick MP Mike Allen. In the 2015 federal election, Armstrong was defeated by Liberal Bill Casey. 40th Parliament Armstrong served as a member on the Standing Committee on Environment and Sustainable Development, the Standing Joint Committee on the Library of Parliament, the Standing Joint Committee on Scrutiny of Regulations and the Standing Committee on Canadian Heritage. During the 40th Parliament, Armstrong sponsored a Private Member's Bill, Bill C-636 ‚Äì An Act Respecting the Marine Mammals Regulations (Seal Fishery Observation Licence). The bill would have increased the distance that a person must maintain from another person who is fishing for seals.

He was educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton and at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich before being commissioned into the Royal Artillery in 1928. In 1931, Block joined the 2nd Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery, and went with them to Cairo as adjutant. He was an instructor at RMA Woolwich in 1936 until the outbreak of war. World War II On the outbreak of war Block was posted to the 12th Light Anti- Aircraft Regiment, TA, in West Lothian, again as adjutant. His obituary records his wartime services in North Africa and Italy: ‚ÄúIn April 1943, the Axis forces were slowly being squeezed into a pocket around Tunis. On 9 April, the 26th Armoured Brigade received orders to drive a gap through the high ridges flanking the Fondouk Pass. Standing in their way, guarding the entrance, was the Djebel Rhorab, a rocky outcrop held by German infantry in strength. The armour's advance was blocked by mines and anti-tank guns at the western end of the pass and the task of pushing the enemy off the Rhorab was given to the 1st Guards Brigade. Block, then a major, was the battery commander chosen to accompany a battalion of the Welsh Guards in the attack. The Welsh Guards assaulted the Rhorab under covering fire from the Yeomanry guns. Shells landed only a few yards ahead of the advancing Welshmen, but so well were the Germans dug in that it took four attempts before the position was captured. For his superb fire control and courage during the bitter fighting, Block was awarded a MC. Block attended Staff College in 1942 and, later that year, was appointed GS02 to the 6th Armoured Division at Troon and then in North Africa. In January 1943, he moved from Divisional HQ to take command of \\"C\\" Battery of the Ayrshire Yeomanry at Bou Arada, south-west of Tunis. In March, when the rest of his regiment was out of the line, the Germans mounted a strong attack, over-running the infantry positions and advancing to within 600 yards of the battery position. Block responded with deadly accurate shooting and the onslaught was beaten off with heavy enemy casualties. He was Mentioned in Despatches. In April, following the action in which Block won his MC, the Ayrshire Yeomanry lost two CO's within a few days. Block took over and in May led his regiment in the final battle for Tunis. Block embarked for Naples with his regiment and their 25-pounder field guns in February 1944. It was the Ayrshire Yeomanry's first experience of mountains and mule tracks. In April, the 1st Guards Brigade took over the Cassino sector with the Yeomanry in support. Much of the town was a chaotic maze of rubble, ruins and craters. Strong points, like the jail and the cemetery crypt outside the town, were turned into battalion HQs with the Yeomanry manning observation posts and providing the wireless operators. The German 1st Parachute Division was aggressive and its snipers and machineguns were all too efficient. In some areas the houses that they occupied were within 50 yards of British positions. Block devised a highly effective system of shooting that caused great destruction to these targets, and when some German tanks crept into the town, he borrowed an American 8 in howitzer and scored several direct hits. On Hitler's birthday, the German part of the town was bedecked with swastikas. The gunners tried to shoot these down but with only partial success. Life in Cassino started after dark. The route to the crypt HQ was within range of the German guns and had to be negotiated ventre a terre, in total silence. Porters delivered supplies under a nightly smokescreen. The German soldiers formed up for PT drill outside the Hotel des Roses, but the Yeomanry soon put a stop to that. On one occasion, returning from a late visit to a battalion HQ, Block and a small party became lost in no-man's land. The terrain was covered by German machineguns on fixed lines and was devoid of a single feature that could help them regain their bearings. Suddenly, in an uncanny stillness, a nightingale sang. \\"I know where we are,\\" exclaimed Block, \\"we must be in Berkeley Square!\\" After Cassino, the Ayrshire Yeomanry fought a mobile battle northwards up the spine of Italy to the Gothic Line. It was a slogging match with the German rearguards who could choose their ground for battle. In May, the advance of the 1st Guards Brigade was halted by the enemy dug in on Monte Piccolo, a bleak and stony hill south of Arce. The Guards attacked, supported by the Yeomanry gunners, and captured the feature. The German paratroopers counter-attacked four times. Each assault was broken up by brilliant shooting directed by Block, who was wounded in the action. For his skill and gallantry in leading his regiment through its many battles, Block was awarded the DSO. In the autumn of 1944, he was posted to 8th Army HQ as GSO1 RA before moving to Allied HQ in Vienna the following year. He returned to England in 1947 on his appointment as College Commander of RMA Sandhurst. Post war In 1949, Block assumed command of the 2nd Regiment, Royal Horse Artillery and was stationed at Retford and Hildesheim, before being posted to SHAPE at Versailles as GSO1 in 1951. In 1953, he was appointed Commander, Royal Artillery, 7th Armoured Division at Verden. He commanded the 18th Training Brigade RA at Oswestry in 1958, was appointed ADC to the Queen in 1959, retiring in 1961 as a brigadier. Following his retirement Block became involved in his local community, being a churchwarden at West Chelborough in Dorset and chairman of the Cattistock Hunt.

Unlike the Missoula Floods, which also occurred during the same period in the Pacific Northwest, the Bonneville flood only happened once. The flood is believed to be the second largest in known geologic history. Cause and events Red Rock Pass, Idaho. About 14,500 years ago, pluvial Lake Bonneville in northern Utah reached its highest water level since its formation. The lake occupied the present-day basin of the Great Salt Lake, but was far larger, covering about . As it rose the lake level caused seepage at, then breached, the ancient level of Red Rock Pass, a mountain pass at the headwaters of the Portneuf River, a tributary of the Snake River above present-day American Falls Reservoir. Ancient Red Rock Pass was the site of two alluvial fans descending from opposite sides of the notch, forming a natural dam. When the dam collapsed, it released a -high flood crest down the Portneuf River valley, also spilling into the neighboring Bear River valley. When it reached the Snake River, it eroded away a lava dam that had been at the site of the present-day American Falls, releasing a lake, American Falls Lake, that had formed behind the natural dam. At the peak of the flood, approximately poured over the Snake River Plain at speeds of up to per hour and deposited hundreds of square miles of sediments eroded from upstream. The flood scoured the -deep Snake River Canyon through the underlying basalt and loess soil, creating Shoshone Falls and several other waterfalls along the Snake River. It also carved and increased in size many other tributary canyons, including those of the Bruneau River and Salmon Falls Creek. The flood then entered Hells Canyon, significantly widening the gorge. Its waters eventually reached the Pacific Ocean via the Columbia River. Legacy Although the peak of the flood lasted a few weeks at most, erosion at Red Rock Pass continued for a few years before water ceased to spill over. The flood drained the top of Lake Bonneville, which constituted about of water, and lowered the lake level to a stage known as the Provo shoreline. The flood transformed the Snake River Plain into a series of channeled scablands resembling the Columbia Plateau. Also left by the flood were the many \\"melon\\" boulders distributed throughout the canyons in the Snake River Plain. According to some geologists, the total volume of the Bonneville flood was actually greater than any individual one of the Missoula Floods, although the Missoula floods released more water as a whole, and at least one had a much higher peak flow rate. Much of the sediment scoured by the flood was deposited near the mouth of the Snake River. It now lies beneath about 20 layers of Missoula Floods deposits.

The series was a summer replacement for the variety show The Ford Show. Jack Barry was the emcee and Don Pardo was the announcer. High Low was broadcast from Studio 6A at NBC Studios in the Rockefeller Center in Manhattan. Game play One contestant, stationed in an isolation booth, competed against a three-member panel of celebrities in a test of knowledge inspired by the game High-Low Poker. On his or her first appearance, the contestant was staked $500 of betting money. Barry posed a question containing multiple answers to both the contestant and the panel. Each member of the panel would secretly bid on how many correct answers he or she could give to the question. The panel, studio audience, and home audience could see the bids, but the contestant could not due to the way the booth was situated. After being told the amount of the \\"high\\" bid, the contestant would be given a choice: * To double his/her winnings by matching the undisclosed \\"lowest\\" bid. * To triple his/her winnings by matching the disclosed \\"high\\" bid. After making his or her choice, the contestant's booth was turned off and the corresponding panelist attempted to complete his/her bid. Once the panelist successfully completed his/her bid, the contestant's booth was turned back on. The contestant must then give as many correct answers as the panelist gave. If the contestant successfully matched the panelist, he or she won the game and the champion's winnings were multiplied accordingly. The contestant also earned the right to return on the next show to decide whether to play another game or walk away with his/her winnings; if at any point a contestant failed to match the panelist's bid, the contestant lost the game and departed with 10% of all previous winnings. Contestants could continue playing with their current winnings for up to five games. At that point, if the contestant decided to try for a sixth game, he or she started a new set of five games with another $500 stake. Contestants remain until they walk away or are defeated. Among the celebrities who appeared as panelists on High Low were actor/singer Burl Ives, actresses Patricia Medina and Arlene Dahl, actor Walter Slezak, John Van Doren (Charles Van Doren's brother), and former Twenty-One champ Hank Bloomgarden.

SR 611 provides a major artery for commuters, connecting the Eisenhower Valley section of Alexandria with Lorton and points south along US 1. SR 611 is known by three names: Telegraph Road, Old Colchester Road, and Furnace Road. Route description Telegraph Road Telegraph Road at its intersection with Jeff Todd Way, after a late March snowstorm in 2018 SR 611 starts as Telegraph Road at an intersection with SR 241, North Kings Highway, near Alexandria. North of this intersection Telegraph Road intersects with the Capital Beltway (I-95 and I-495), and SR 236 (Duke Street). Telegraph Road starts as a six-lane divided highway, passing a short commercial section and a residential section. When Telegraph Road passes SR 644 (Franconia Road), it reduces to four lanes divided, and gradually reduces from there to two lanes undivided. Shortly before SR 611 intersects with SR 633 (South Kings Highway), it intersects with SR 1635 (Rose Hill Drive). Across from this intersection is the entrance to Lee District Park. As Telegraph Road approaches South Kings Highway it passes Greendale Golf Course to the northwest. As SR 611 approaches SR 613 (Beulah Street), it widens to four lanes divided. Throughout most of the route from SR 635 (Hayfield Road) to the Fairfax County Parkway it forms the northernmost boundary of Fort Belvoir. After intersecting with the Fairfax County Parkway, Telegraph Road gradually turns to the south and passes by an industrialized area. It ends at an intersection with US 1 (Richmond Highway). Old Colchester Road On the other side of US 1, SR 611 becomes Old Colchester Road. Almost immediately it reduces to two lanes undivided. Shortly after this point it passes the rear side of the Noman M. Cole, Jr., Pollution Control Plant, which empties its treated water into nearby Pohick Creek.Noman M. Cole, Jr., Pollution Control Plant Retrieved January 15, 2010 Old Colchester Road then crosses Pohick Creek, and soon after intersects with SR 242, Gunston Road. From there Old Colchester Road heads toward the Occoquan River. It first intersects with Furnace Road. One must turn west to stay on SR 611. Furnace Road Furnace Road starts out as a two lane undivided road. It crosses under railroad tracks owned by CSX Transportation through a one-lane underpass. The road curves and is parallel with US 1, then turns and intersects with that road. On the other side of US 1, Furnace Road is four-lanes divided until an underpass with I-95, where it reduces to two lanes undivided. As it heads north, Furnace Road passes the I-95 Landfill (run by Fairfax County) to the west and a private landfill area to the east. The road turns slightly to the west and joins SR 642, Lorton Road at a Y intersection. Shortly after, the two routes diverge in another Y intersection. SR 611 heads to the west, and ends at an intersection with SR 123, Ox Road. History  Old Colchester Road  Old Colchester Road used to be a road leading to the seaport of Colchester, Virginia, which was on the banks of the Occoquan River near the Potomac River. Silt filled up the Occoquan River, making Colchester untenable as a seaport. Alexandria, Virginia became the major seaport in the area, taking the place of Colchester. The result was that Old Colchester Road became a minor road, and much later was incorporated into SR 611 (Fairfax County). Furnace Road Furnace Road largely borders the old Lorton Reformatory property to the east. Part of that property has become Fairfax County's I-95 Landfill.Laurel Hill Property Division Retrieved January 20, 2010 The area to the east of the I-95 Landfill is a private landfillComprehensive Plan - Lower Potomac p. 79 Retrieved January 21, 2010 Two large tracts south of the landfill are destined to become Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority parkland, although right now (January 2010) they are just wooded land.Laurel Hill Master Plan Retrieved January 20, 2010 North of the landfill is a tract that is destined to be parkland run by the Fairfax County Park Authority, although it, too, is just a wooded piece of land.

Offenses will typically exploit the flat in order to neutralize a strong attack from the defensive line in the middle of the field or to manipulate a defense's strong pass coverage farther down field. For example, in flat route plays, quarterbacks pass the ball to a player (often a running back) in the flat in hopes that, while the pass has not gone downfield, the receiver (far from the middle of the field and not far downfield enough to worry about cornerbacks and safeties) will have a clear line for an after-the-catch run. If the quarterback hopes to throw farther downfield, the running back in the flat is an outlet receiver. If the receiver is accompanied by blockers, the play is called a screen pass. Defenses meanwhile will generally assign a linebacker \\"flat responsibility\\" to guard against such passes, but it is difficult to defend against because the offense will usually use the flat route in conjunction with an attack downfield (sometimes as a feint), necessitating a quick linebacker adjustment to make an early tackle against a faster running back after the pass.

Feliciano Soberanes (1788‚Äì1868) was born in Monterey where he spent his whole life. He married Maria Antonia Rodriguez (1795‚Äì1883) in 1810. He was regidor in 1829 and 1830, and then alcade at Monterey in 1838‚Äì39. Feliciano became administrator of Mission Soledad lands and received Rancho Ex-Mission Soledad in 1845.

Feliciano Soberanes was granted the five square league Rancho San Lorenzo in 1841. The sons of Feliciano, with Panfilo Soberanes in charge, worked Rancho San Lorenzo for many years. With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored.

Sherwood began moving his attention to Rancho Sausal which he had purchased from Jacob P. Leese in 1860. About 1865, Carlisle S. Abbott, born in Quebec, Canada, purchased about of Rancho San Lorenzo. In the mid-1870s, Abbott joined with David Jacks to build the narrow gauge Monterey & Salinas Valley Railroad. When the railroad went bankrupt, Abbott lost everything. In 1884, Charles H.

Rodrigo Mart√≠nez () (died July 1138) was a Leonese nobleman, landowner, courtier, military leader, governor, and diplomat, \\"the most powerful lay figure in the region of the western Tierra de Campos,\\" who \\"emerges as far and away the most regular visitor to the court of Alfonso VII between 1127 and 1138.\\"Barton (1997), 129. He was a member of the Flag√≠nez family, rose to the highest rank in the kingdom and met his end on the battlefield. He was the eldest son of Mart√≠n Fla√≠nez and Sancha Fern√°ndez. Throughout his career he was closely associated with his brothers Pedro and Osorio Mart√≠nez. All three Mart√≠nez brothers met their ends on the battlefield.Barton (1997), 57. Mart√≠n Fla√≠nez is known to have donated a meadow, money, and some candles to the monastery of Santa Eugenia de Cordovilla because the monks had performed a successful exorcism on the young Rodrigo.Barton (1997), 209. On behalf of the Crown: governor and diplomat The castle of Aguilar de Campoo, one of Rodrigo's most important and longest- held fiefs. The Torre del Homenaje, all that remains of the castle at Castroverde, controlled by Rodrigo in 1117, his first tenencia. The first record of Rodrigo's public career dates to 1 May 1110.Barton (1997), 294‚Äì95. In 1117 he was governing the tenencia of Castroverde. Between 1117 and 1136 he held the tenencia of Becilla de Valderaduey. From 1125 to 1137 he held that of Aguilar de Campoo. Queen Urraca died on 8 March 1126. When Alfonso VII finally took control of the \\"towers of Le√≥n\\", the fortress that guarded the imperial capital of Le√≥n, Rodrigo along with the other Leonese magnates came to do him homage.CAI, I, ¬ß4. In 1134 he held that of Mayorga and in 1135 those of Atienza and Medina del Campo concurrently. In 1137 he held Calahorra, and there is a reference to him ruling Calahorra in a charter mistakenly dated to 1140. In 1136‚Äì37 he was also governing the Tierra de Campos. At some point he seems to have ruled in Grajal de Campos, since a charter of 1152 refers to both him and Ramiro Fr√≥ilaz as having held the title of potentior of Grajal. Between 1126 and 1138 he held the towers of Le√≥n for the crown. From 1120 to 1126 he held the tenencia of Melgar de Arriba (or possibly Melgar de Fernamental). It is possible that in 1126 he briefly held Somoza, but the only charter referring to this is suspect. From 1123 to 1136 he ruled Villalobos. From 1132 until his death he ruled Zamora.Barton (1997), 117 n87. By the end of 1128 Rodrigo had attained comital rank. In 1129 he was employing Pedro Manga as his majordomo. Pedro would later hold the tenencias of Luna and Valencia de Don Juan from the crown. In 1131 a certain Fernando Men√©ndez was acting as Rodrigo's vicar in Zamora.Reilly (1998), 194. In 1133 Rodrigo Mart√≠nez and Gutierre Fern√°ndez de Castro led an embassy to Rueda de Jal√≥n (Rota) to negotiate with the petty Muslim prince Sayf al-Dawla (Zafadola). They were \\"received honorably [and presented] with magnificent gifts.\\"CAI, I, ¬ß28; Barton, 140. They accompanied Sayf back to Le√≥n to meet with Alfonso VII. Rodrigo was rewarded by the emperor for his loyalty in June‚ÄìJuly 1135 with some lands confiscated from the defeated Asturian rebel Gonzalo Pel√°ez. Between 1135 and 1137 Rodrigo purchased land at Castrillo. Private transactions: marriage and property On 7 October 1123 he made a donation to the Benedictine monastery at Sahag√∫n. On 1 July 1131 Rodrigo donated an estate at Oteruelo to Gonzalo Alfonso and Teresa Pel√°ez. Between 1130 and 1132 he had a dispute with Arias II, Bishop of Le√≥n, over the property owned by one Pedro Pel√°ez.Cf. Fletcher (1978), 238‚Äì39, doc. VIII in the Appendix. On 29 March 1133 Alfonso VII granted immunity (Latin cautum, Spanish coto) to the count's estate at Castellanos. This gave Rodrigo the right to collect taxes and the profits of justice, to call upon the male denizens for military service, and to refuse entry to royal officials such as the merino and say√≥n.Barton (1997), 92. Rodrigo married Urraca Fern√°ndez, daughter of Fernando Garc√©s de Hita and Estefan√≠a Armengol. The couple was betrothed while she was no more than ten years old, at which time (21 November 1129) Rodrigo granted her a bridewealth consisting in eleven villages in the Campos G√≥ticos.Barton (1997), 52‚Äì53. Estefan√≠a was Fernando's second wife, and he granted her her bridewealth in November 1119, cf. Barton, 40. The charter, carta de arras, noting this gift is in the archives of Valladolid. In it Rodrigo refers to Urraca as Fernandi Garcie et infantisse domine Stephanie filie, \\"daughter of Fernando Garc√©s and the infantissa Do√±a Estefan√≠a.\\"Salazar Acha (1991); Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n (1984), 39, 52‚Äì53. Queen Urraca on two occasions referred to Estefan√≠a as her congermana, cousin. Urraca never bore him any children of whom we have record, but the couple were active in property acquisitions. Together they acquired properties scattered throughout the Campos from Carri√≥n in the east to Le√≥n in the west to Zamora in the south (de Carrione usque in Legionem et Cemorem et per totos Campos).Barton (1997), 71 and 118 n90. These acquisitions (gananciales) were bought by Alfonso VII after Rodrigo's death. On 21 January 1139 the emperor granted Amusco and an estate at Vertavillo to Urraca in exchange for Manganeses and \\"all those purchases and gains, which she made with her husband Rodrigo Mart√≠nez\\" (totis illis comparationibus et gananzes, quas fecit cum marito suo Roderico Martinez).Barton (1997), 118 and n90. At some point after Rodrigo's death Urraca began an affair with Alfonso VII, eventually giving birth to a daughter by him, Estefan√≠a, who married Fernando Rodr√≠guez de Castro.Canal S√°nchez-Pag√≠n (1984), 54. Alfonso's purchase of her and Rodrigo's gananciales may have been designed to provide for this daughter. Urraca conducted a number of property transactions with Alfonso between 1139 and 1148.She received imperial grants of land on 9 September 1140 and on 3 February 1148, cf. Barton 118 n90. Military activities and death During the rebellion of 1130 led by the Gonz√°lez de Lara brothers, Pedro and Rodrigo, and their kinsman Bertr√°n de Risnel, Alfonso VII called upon Rodrigo and Osorio Mart√≠nez to attack Pedro D√≠az, a supporter of the rebels, in his castle at Valle. According to the Chronica Adefonsi, Rodrigo and Osorio surrounded the castle and sent reports to Alfonso about the insults the garrison was hurling at them because of their failed assaults. The king came and the castle was taken and razed.CAI, I, ¬ß¬ß19‚Äì20. Reportedly Pedro D√≠az, upon surrendering, said to Alfonso, \\"My Lord and King, I stand at fault; I earnestly beg you, for the love of God who always aids you, do not hand me or my family over to Count Rodrigo. Instead, you yourself take vengeance upon me as you see fit.\\" Rodrigo's reputation for ill treatment of his prisoners is also recorded in the Chronica: > Count Rodrigo captured other knights. He sent some of these to prison until > they surrendered all their possessions to him. He made others serve him for > several days without any compensation. Those who had been insulting him he > yoked with oxen to plow and feed on grass like cattle. He also made them eat > straw from a manger. After he had stripped them of all their riches, he > allowed the pathetic prisoners to go their way.CAI, I, ¬ß21. On the orders of its rebel leader, Gimeno √ç√±iguez, the town of Coyanza also surrendered to the king to avoid falling into Rodrigo's hands. Siege tower like the one in which Rodrigo was mortally wounded. Rodrigo died at the Siege of Coria, where he was assisting the emperor with his own knightly retinue (mesnada), in July 1138. The siege was the culmination of a summer razzia deep into al-Andalus. The razzia had begun in May under the command of Alfonso, Rodrigo Mart√≠nez, and Rodrigo Fern√°ndez de Castro.Barton (1997), 167‚Äì68. The raiding army was known as an algara. It included, in this case, the palace guard and the militia of Salamanca. For this campaign see CAI, II, ¬ß¬ß135‚Äì36. Rodrigo Mart√≠nez died during an assault on the city walls, described in the Chronica Adefonsi: > The Emperor summoned the commanders and ordered them to mobilize the war > engines in preparation for the assault on the city. He left with his hunters > for the mountains then in search of deer, boar and bear. In the morning the > assault was begun. Consul Rodrigo Mart√≠nez himself climbed one of the wooden > towers. Many knights, archers and slingers went up the tower with him. Then > one of the enemy by pure chance shot an arrow at the tower which the consul > had climbed. Because of our sins, the arrow hit its target on the other side > of the wickerwork. The iron point of the arrow struck the neck of the > Consul. It pierced his headpiece and corselet and wounded him. Nevertheless, > after the Consul realized that he was wounded, he quickly grasped the point > of the arrow and, removed it. At once he began to hemorrhage. Neither the > conjurers nor the physicians could stop the bleeding. Finally Rodrigo said > to those around him, \\"Take off my arms, for I am extremely disheartened.\\" > Immediately they removed his arms and carried him to his tent. Throughout > the entire day they attempted to cure his wound. Around sunset all hope in > medicine was lost, and he died. As soon as the news had spread through the > camp, there was tremendous mourning‚Äîmore than anyone had imagined. Upon > returning from the mountains, the Emperor was informed of the Consul's > death. He learned the cause upon entering the camp. Alfonso gathered all of > his advisors, and in their presence, he appointed Osorio, Rodrigo's brother, > to be consul in his place.CAI, II, ¬ß¬ß137‚Äì38. The siege was lifted the next day, and Rodrigo's body was immediately conducted to its burial place in Le√≥n by his brother Osorio \\"accompanied by his own military force and by that of his brother\\".CAI, II, ¬ß139. Rodrigo was buried in the family mausoleum beside his parents, in a church next to the Cathedral of Santa Mar√≠a, possibly the monastery of San Pedro de los Huertos, which his parents had received by a royal grant of Urraca of Zamora and Elvira of Toro in 1099.Barton (1997), 45‚Äì46. For his burial see CAI, II, ¬ß139: \\"The mourning over the death of Rodrigo Mart√≠nez increased in every city. In Le√≥n they buried him with honors in his father's tomb near the Basilica of Saint Mary. The tomb is located very near the episcopal throne.\\" Osorio succeeded Rodrigo as count and received his tenencias of Aguilar, the Campos, Le√≥n, and Zamora.Barton (1997), 117.

He may be the same person as Johannes Cuvellarius from Bapaume, a suburb of Arras, who is mentioned in documents of 1258. He was the respondent in nine jeux partis and judge of six; he also composed six chansons courtoises. His six chansons are: *Amours est une merveille *Anuis et desesperance *J'ai une dame enamee *Jolivet√©s et joenece *Mout me plaisent a sentir *Pour la meillour qu'onques formast Nature This last one can be approximately dated, since it is dedicated to Wagon Wion, sheriff (√©chevin) of Arras in 1265 and dead by February 1273. Cuvelier's chansons are predominantly heptasyllabic, although one (Pour la meillour) is decasyllabic and there are pentasyllabic lines in the others. All are in bar form with the exception of Amours est, which is AA'BB'CC'DE. The use of motives in the caudae is typical. Unusual for his place and time he favoured plagal modes, save for the authentic J'ai une dame. In the readings of the music for Amours est, Mout me plaisent, and Pour la meillour found in the Chansonnier Cang√© (BnF fr.846), there is evidence of modal rhythm. Ligatures in Anuis et desesperance and Jolivet√©s also suggest the \\"free use\\" of modal rhythm. Jehan de Grieviler debated Cuvelier in Cuvelier, un jugement and in Cuvelier, j'ain mieus que moi Gamart de Vilers addressed Cuvelier as \\"sire\\", an indication of his rank. Cuvelier's most popular debating partner was Jehan Bretel, who initiated six juex partis with him: *Cuvelier, dites moi voir *Cuvelier, et vous, Ferri (also addressed to Lambert Ferri) *Cuvelier, or i parra *Cuvelier, s'il est ainsi *Cuvelier, vous amer√©s *Je vous demant, Cuvelier, espond√©s Bretel and Ferri joined up to propose a jeu with Cuvelier and the Tresorier d'Aire: Biaus sire tresorier d'Aire. Cuvelier also judged a jeu parti involving Adam de la Halle. References *Theodore Karp. \\"Cuvelier d'Arras, Jehan le.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. Accessed 9 November 2009.

He knew either Gace Brul√© or the Chastelain de Couci, two of the first-generation trouv√®res. He was probably a member of a landed family of √âpernay, or possibly of a family resident in and around Noyon. He is probably the local \\"Pierre II\\" referred to in documents from between 1210 and 1224. Four songs are attributed to Pierre in the Chansonnier du Roi and the Noailles Chansonnier, and all appear in other chansonniers with different attributions. All the melodies are in bar form. Most unusual are the presence of a melodic tritone in two sources for Fine amours et bone esperance and of a sharpened subdominant in Chanter me fet ce don't je crien morir, both created by the use of accidentals. Fine amours served as the model for an anonymous composition of the same name (the second line beginning Me fait), an anonymous piece beginning L'autrier par une matinee, and an anonymous song to the Virgin Mary, Douce dame, vierge Marie. The music of Chanter me fet was used in two different readings of Pour la pucele en chantant me deport by Gautier de Coincy and the lyrics were a model for the anonymous Destroiz d'amours et pensis sans deport.

Overview The Canon presents a summary of some of the different areas of science, as well as extensive descriptions of, and interviews with, contemporary scientists who work in these fields. Angier‚Äôs tenet is that an understanding of the basics of major areas of science can assist with providing a means by which to understand current scientific issues, and that this process should be fun. In her Introduction, Angier writes: Angier included quotes from the scientists she interviewed throughout her descriptions of different scientific topics in an attempt to show how scientists experience and think about their work, and why they do it. Scientists interviewed To obtain material for The Canon, Angier interviewed a number of scientists, professors, and other science professionals, and incorporated their stories and quotes into her work. She asked them questions such as, \\"What does it mean to think scientifically?\\" and \\"What should nonspecialist nonchildren know about science, and how should they know it, and what is this thing called fun?\\" Most of these scientists are presently active in their field of research.

Construction, acquisition, and commissioning USS Aloha (center) at the New York Navy Yard in Brooklyn, New York, on 2 October 1917, while serving as the flagship of Rear Admiral Cameron McRae Winslow.Aloha was built as a private steel-hulled, single-screw, bark-rigged steam yacht in 1910 by the Fore River Shipbuilding Company at Quincy, Massachusetts, for \\"Commodore\\" Arthur Curtiss James (1867‚Äì1941), an industrialist, railroad magnate, and yachtsman. She was the second yacht of the name built for James, was designed for ocean cruising, and had a large crew of 39. For her maiden voyage in 1910, James took her to England and Scotland. In 1911 he sailed her to Panama and Ireland, and to Egypt and the Near East in 1912 and 1913. The outbreak of World War I in Europe in July 1914 curtailed his voyages. On 22 April 1917, after the United States had entered the war earlier that month, the U.S. Navy acquired Aloha from James under a free lease for use as a patrol vessel during the war. She was commissioned on 5 June 1917 as USS Aloha (SP-317). Career A halftone reproduction of a 1919 painting of USS Aloha at sea during World War I Soon after commissioning, Aloha was assigned to serve as flagship for Rear Admiral Cameron McRae Winslow (1854‚Äì1932), Inspector of Naval Districts, East Coast. No record of Alohas activities during 1917 has survived. On the morning of 1 January 1918, while Aloha lay moored at the Norfolk Navy Yard at Portsmouth, Virginia, a fire broke out in downtown Norfolk, which quickly spread to engulf almost two city blocks. The city's civil authorities soon requested help from the Navy, which dispatched men from Norfolk Naval Base and ships nearby. Aloha contributed 12 men under a Chief Boatswain's Mate Whalton to the efforts that ultimately succeeded in bringing the stubborn blaze under control, although not before it did US$2,000,000 in damage. The civil government, fearing \\"incendiaries\\", or German agents, suggested that naval guards were required, as well. Aloha sent a detachment of 15 sailors under an Ensign Hall, USNRF, on the morning of 2 January 1918 as the Navy placed Norfolk briefly under martial law in the wake of the blaze. They remained ashore only a short time before returning to their ship shortly before noon on 2 January. Aloha remained at Norfolk until 23 February 1918, when she got underway with Rear Admiral Winslow embarked. She reached Key West on 28 February 1918. Over the next few months, Aloha touched at ports along the southeastern United States East Coast and on the United States Gulf Coast, ranging from Key West and Pensacola, Florida to Galveston, Texas, and New Orleans, Louisiana. Rear Admiral Winslow, usually accompanied by his aide, an Ensign Ackert, USNRF, and a Chief Yeoman Timmermann, conducted inspections of Coastal Air Station Miami and Naval Reserve Training Camp Miami at Miami; Naval Station New Orleans; the naval defenses of Tampa, Florida; Naval Station Jacksonville and the Jacksonville Navy Yard at Jacksonville; and the training camp at Charleston, South Carolina Aloha then underwent voyage repairs at Charleston from 15 April to 17 May 1918. Aloha shifted to Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 20 May 1918, where Rear Admiral Winslow inspected the training camp at Naval Base Hampton Roads. On 22 May 1918, while Aloha lay anchored in Hampton Roads, a lighthouse tender hailed her and asked if she could care for an aviator she had picked up who had met with an accident. Fortunately, the pilot proved to be uninjured, so he was sent to Naval Aviation Base Norfolk by motor launch. Aloha spent the remainder of May 1918 in the Tidewater region of Virginia before she departed for points north. She transferred Rear Admiral Winslow to patrol vessel USS Edorea (SP-549) on 1 June 1918, so he could inspect Naval Base Lewes at Lewes, Delaware, but he returned on board that afternoon. Aloha then coaled at the Philadelphia Navy Yard at Philadelphia on 3 June 1918 before returning to Hampton Roads, via Lewes, on 8 June 1918. She then cruised in the Hampton Roads and Chesapeake Bay area for the balance of June 1918 before heading north for New York City, where on 6 July 1918, Captain H. D. Hinckley of the United States Coast Guard relieved Lieutenant Swift as commanding officer. Aloha spent much of the summer of 1918 in waters off the northeastern United States, at Port Jefferson, New York; New London, Connecticut; Newport, Rhode Island; Machias and Boothbay, Maine; Portsmouth, New Hampshire; and Gloucester, Massachusetts, before arriving at the Boston Navy Yard in Boston for a major refit on 27 August 1918. During this period of repairs and alterations, which lasted through September and October 1918, she received additional armament in the form of two 4-inch (102-millimeter) guns. After departing the Boston Navy Yard on 5 November 1918, Aloha spent much of the ensuing passage to Shelburne, Nova Scotia, Canada, under sail and arrived at Shelburne on 7 November 1918. Returning to Boston on 10 November 1918, Aloha was lying moored there when the armistice with Germany ending hostilities was signed on 11 November 1918. The remainder of Alohas Navy career was spent alternately at Newport, Rhode Island, and at New London and New Haven, Connecticut, before she arrived back at New York City on 14 December 1918, shifting her berth to a point off Pier 72, East 25th Street, New York City, on 15 December 1918. She remained there until 10 January 1919. Decommissioning Aloha entered the New York Navy Yard at Brooklyn, New York, on 10 January 1919. Shipyard workmen removed her guns on 11 January 1918. Returning to her anchorage off Pier 72, Aloha spent the next few days undergoing the initial stage of the transformation from warship to yacht in anticipation of her return to Arthur Curtiss James; her crew cleaned the ship, shined brightwork, and landed such paraphernalia as flag mess gear, chairs, and an oval table from the admiral's cabin at pier 72. Her conversion back into a yacht was almost complete when, on 29 January 1919, her crew mustered aft and Captain Hinckley read the orders from the Commandant, 3rd Naval District, decommissioning Aloha. Down came the admiral's flag‚ÄîRear Admiral Winslow had maintained Aloha as his flagship to the very last moment‚Äîand the national colors, and a representative of James signed a receipt for the yacht. Later career Over the ensuing months, James had Aloha converted back to her full, prewar splendor. During 1921 and 1922, he took her around the world; in 1925, she cruised the Mediterranean; in 1927, she went to England, the Baltic Sea, and the Netherlands; and in 1930, she again went to the Mediterranean. Aloha appeared at New York City during the Presidential Review of 31 May 1934. Famous in her time and the only bark- rigged yacht of her size afloat, Aloha was scrapped in 1938.

Symbolic execution is used in conjunction with an automated theorem prover or constraint solver based on constraint logic programming to generate new concrete inputs (test cases) with the aim of maximizing code coverage. Its main focus is finding bugs in real- world software, rather than demonstrating program correctness. A description and discussion of the concept was introduced in \\"DART: Directed Automated Random Testing\\" by Patrice Godefroid, Nils Klarlund, and Koushik Sen. The paper \\"CUTE: A concolic unit testing engine for C\\", by Koushik Sen, Darko Marinov, and Gul Agha, further extended the idea to data structures, and first coined the term concolic testing. Another tool, called EGT (renamed to EXE and later improved and renamed to KLEE), based on similar ideas was independently developed by Cristian Cadar and Dawson Engler in 2005, and published in 2005 and 2006. PathCrawler first proposed to perform symbolic execution along a concrete execution path, but unlike concolic testing PathCrawler does not simplify complex symbolic constraints using concrete values. These tools (DART and CUTE, EXE) applied concolic testing to unit testing of C programs and concolic testing was originally conceived as a white box improvement upon established random testing methodologies. The technique was later generalized to testing multithreaded Java programs with jCUTE, and unit testing programs from their executable codes (tool OSMOSE). , It was also combined with fuzz testing and extended to detect exploitable security issues in large-scale x86 binaries by Microsoft Research's SAGE. The concolic approach is also applicable to model checking. In a concolic model checker, the model checker traverses states of the model representing the software being checked, while storing both a concrete state and a symbolic state. The symbolic state is used for checking properties on the software, while the concrete state is used to avoid reaching unreachable state. One such tool is ExpliSAT by Sharon Barner, Cindy Eisner, Ziv Glazberg, Daniel Kroening and Ishai RabinovitzSharon Barner, Cindy Eisner, Ziv Glazberg, Daniel Kroening, Ishai Rabinovitz: ExpliSAT: Guiding SAT-Based Software Verification with Explicit States. Haifa Verification Conference 2006: 138-154  Birth of concolic testing  Implementation of traditional symbolic execution based testing requires the implementation of a full-fledged symbolic interpreter for a programming language. Concolic testing implementors noticed that implementation of full- fledged symbolic execution can be avoided if symbolic execution can be piggy- backed with the normal execution of a program through instrumentation. This idea of simplifying implementation of symbolic execution gave birth to concolic testing.  Development of SMT solvers  An important reason for the rise of concolic testing (and more generally, symbolic-execution based analysis of programs) in the decade since it was introduced in 2005 is the dramatic improvement in the efficiency and expressive power of SMT Solvers. The key technical developments that lead to the rapid development of SMT solvers include combination of theories, lazy solving, DPLL(T) and the huge improvements in the speed of SAT solvers. SMT solvers that are particularly tuned for concolic testing include Z3, STP, Z3str2, and Boolector.  Example  Consider the following simple example, written in C: void f(int x, int y) { int z = 2*y; if (x  100000) { if (x < z) { assert(0); /* error */ } } } Execution path tree for this example. Three tests are generated corresponding to the three leaf nodes in the tree, and three execution paths in the program. Simple random testing, trying random values of x and y, would require an impractically large number of tests to reproduce the failure. We begin with an arbitrary choice for x and y, for example x = y = 1\\\\. In the concrete execution, line 2 sets z to 2, and the test in line 3 fails since 1 ‚â† 100000. Concurrently, the symbolic execution follows the same path but treats x and y as symbolic variables. It sets z to the expression 2y and notes that, because the test in line 3 failed, x ‚â† 100000. This inequality is called a path condition and must be true for all executions following the same execution path as the current one. Since we'd like the program to follow a different execution path on the next run, we take the last path condition encountered, x ‚â† 100000, and negate it, giving x = 100000. An automated theorem prover is then invoked to find values for the input variables x and y given the complete set of symbolic variable values and path conditions constructed during symbolic execution. In this case, a valid response from the theorem prover might be x = 100000, y = 0. Running the program on this input allows it to reach the inner branch on line 4, which is not taken since 100000 (x) is not less than 0 (z = 2y). The path conditions are x = 100000 and x ‚â• z. The latter is negated, giving x < z. The theorem prover then looks for x, y satisfying x = 100000, x < z, and z = 2y; for example, x = 100000, y = 50001. This input reaches the error.  Algorithm  Essentially, a concolic testing algorithm operates as follows: # Classify a particular set of variables as input variables. These variables will be treated as symbolic variables during symbolic execution. All other variables will be treated as concrete values. # Instrument the program so that each operation which may affect a symbolic variable value or a path condition is logged to a trace file, as well as any error that occurs. # Choose an arbitrary input to begin with. # Execute the program. # Symbolically re-execute the program on the trace, generating a set of symbolic constraints (including path conditions). # Negate the last path condition not already negated in order to visit a new execution path. If there is no such path condition, the algorithm terminates. # Invoke an automated satisfiability solver on the new set of path conditions to generate a new input. If there is no input satisfying the constraints, return to step 6 to try the next execution path. # Return to step 4. There are a few complications to the above procedure: * The algorithm performs a depth-first search over an implicit tree of possible execution paths. In practice programs may have very large or infinite path trees ‚Äì a common example is testing data structures that have an unbounded size or length. To prevent spending too much time on one small area of the program, the search may be depth-limited (bounded). * Symbolic execution and automated theorem provers have limitations on the classes of constraints they can represent and solve. For example, a theorem prover based on linear arithmetic will be unable to cope with the nonlinear path condition xy = 6. Any time that such constraints arise, the symbolic execution may substitute the current concrete value of one of the variables to simplify the problem. An important part of the design of a concolic testing system is selecting a symbolic representation precise enough to represent the constraints of interest.  Commercial success  Symbolic-execution based analysis and testing, in general, has witnessed a significant level of interest from industry . Perhaps the most famous commercial tool that uses dynamic symbolic execution (aka concolic testing) is the SAGE tool from Microsoft. The KLEE and S2E tools (both of which are open-source tools, and use the STP constraint solver) are widely used in many companies including Micro Focus Fortify, NVIDIA, and IBM . Increasingly these technologies are being used by many security companies and hackers alike to find security vulnerabilities.  Limitations  Concolic testing has a number of limitations: * If the program exhibits nondeterministic behavior, it may follow a different path than the intended one. This can lead to nontermination of the search and poor coverage. * Even in a deterministic program, a number of factors may lead to poor coverage, including imprecise symbolic representations, incomplete theorem proving, and failure to search the most fruitful portion of a large or infinite path tree. * Programs which thoroughly mix the state of their variables, such as cryptographic primitives, generate very large symbolic representations that cannot be solved in practice. For example, the condition \`if(sha256_hash(input)  0x12345678) { ... }\` requires the theorem prover to invert SHA256, which is an open problem.

Actor Steve Dunne was the emcee, with Hal Simms as the announcer and Joann Jordan was the commercial spokesperson for sponsor Hazel Bishop. You're On Your Own was broadcast from CBS Studio 59, also known as the Mansfield Theatre, in Manhattan. Game Play Pilot The pilot episode was recorded between December, 1955 and April 22, 1956 in New York City. Jack Barry was the emcee with Bern Bennett as the announcer. Three contestants compete, one at a time, to win cash for what they know and how fast they can find the answer. The stage contained all kinds of reference materials including encyclopedias, dictionaries, phonograph records with record player, a telephone with phone books, etc. Players can use any of the reference material to find the necessary information. The emcee assigns either a question or task to a player along with an amount of time, between 60 and 120 seconds depending upon difficulty, to complete their assignment. The player must find the correct answer or complete their task as fast as possible and before time ran out. Three assignments were given to each player. If the player was successful on the first assignment, they earned $100 minus $10 for each time segment used to complete the assignment. Time segments represent 10% of the total number of seconds given for the assignment (Example: 60 seconds = 10 six-second time segments). The two remaining assignments were each worth 10 times the amount earned for the previous assignment minus one multiple for each time segment used (Each player can earn a possible $10,000 in a game). However, if the player was unsuccessful at any time, they lost the game and any money earned up to that point. =Daily Double= The player who earned the most money on the broadcast was given a choice: * To walk away and keep their winnings. * To go for double-or-nothing and completing one last assignment called the \\"daily double\\". If the player decided to try for the \\"daily double\\", they must complete their assignment and return on the next show with proof that the assignment was completed. If the player was successful, they walked away with double their winnings from the previous program. However, if the player was unsuccessful, they lost all money earned on the previous program. Series Version 1 You're On Your Own followed a similar format to the pilot described above with a possible top prize of $25,000 to be won by a contestant. Series Version 2 Toward the end of the series run, You're On Your Own had changed its format into one where three contestants competed against each other to answer toss-up questions. If a player buzzed in with a correct answer, they earned one point. However, giving an incorrect answer resulted in the player having to perform a humiliating stunt. The player with the most points won a special prize. Episode Status The pilot episode of You're On Your Own is known to exist and can be found at The Paley Center for Media in New York City.

Biography Background and education Le Blanc-Smith's great- grandfather was Henry Le Blanc (1776-1855), born in Cavenham, Suffolk, one of 13 children of Thomas Le Blanc (1743‚Äì1801) and Felicia, n√©e Pelham (1747‚Äì1840). The Le Blanc's trace their ancestry back to France. In 1792 Henry joined the 71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot and served in India, Scotland, Ireland and South Africa, before losing a leg to a Spanish cannonball while serving as a major in the Expedition to the R√≠o de la Plata in 1806. He was invalided home to serve as lieutenant colonel of the 5th Royal Veteran Battalion in Guernsey, then as Captain of Invalids and Hospital Major at the Royal Hospital Chelsea. He somehow managed to see action during the battle of Waterloo in 1815, and was eventually promoted to colonel. He married Elizabeth McClintock of Drumcar, Ireland, in 1801 and they had four children. Their youngest child, Lucy Mary Le Blanc was born in Guernsey in 1813. Lucy Mary married a clergyman, the Reverend Thomas Tunstall Smith (1810‚Äì1893), rector of Wirksworth, Derbyshire. Together they had eight children; five boys and three girls. All the boys took the surname Le Blanc-Smith. Their fifth child, and third boy, Stanley Le Blanc-Smith (1849‚Äì1922) married Amy Harris in 1880 in Westmorland, and lived in Leatherhead, Surrey, while working as a stockbroker on the London Stock Exchange. They had three sons; Clive (1882‚Äì1907), Geoffrey (1884‚Äì1968) and Maurice. Like his father, Maurice was educated at Radley College, and rowed for the First VIII in 1914. Military service Maurice Le Blanc-Smith entered the Royal Flying Corps as a Special Reserve officer, which meant he first had to learn to fly at his own expense before being commissioned (and then was refunded the costs). He was granted Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 1440 after flying a Maurice Farman biplane at the Military School, Brooklands Aerodrome, on 14 July 1915, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant (on probation) in the Royal Flying Corps the same day. He completed his military flight training, and was appointed a flying officer and confirmed in his rank on 12 October 1915. Le Blanc-Smith served in No. 18 Squadron RFC as a bomber and reconnaissance pilot, flying the Airco DH.2 and the Vickers Gunbus. He was appointed a flight commander with the rank of temporary captain on 20 July 1916, before being promoted to the rank of lieutenant on 1 September. In early 1918, he was reassigned to No. 73 Squadron RFC, flying the Sopwith Camel. With him he brought \\"Adolphus\\", a toy dog presented to him by a French girl which was his mascot on his flying missions. Le Blanc-Smith's first aerial victory came on 10 March 1918 when he destroyed a Fokker Dr.I west of Bohain. On 1 April the Army's Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) were merged to form the Royal Air Force, and his unit became No. 73 Squadron RAF. Le Blanc-Smith destroyed another enemy fighter on 16 May south of the Arras‚ÄìCambrai Road, and on 6 June destroyed a Fokker D.VII south of Roye. On the morning of 12 June he destroyed an Albatros D.V north of Courcelles, and in the evening drove down two aircraft, a Fokker D.VII and an Albatros D.V, west of Tricot about a half hour apart. Both made forced landings and were captured. Finally on 21 July he shared in the destruction of another Fokker Dr.I north-east of Oulchy-le-Ch√¢teau with seven other members of his squadron: Major R. H. Freeman, Lieutenants J. Balfour, Gavin L. Graham, William Sidebottom and William Stephenson, and 2nd Lieutenants Robert Chandler and K. S. Laurie. Le Blanc-Smith was subsequently awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, which was gazetted on 2 August 1918. His citation read: :Captain Maurice Le Blanc-Smith. ::\\"A very efficient officer and successful patrol leader, who, during the late operations, has done great execution in attacking ground targets. On a recent occasion he attacked five enemy aeroplanes, destroying one and driving down another out of control.\\" On 9 August 1918 he was promoted to the temporary rank of major, which he held until 24 April 1919, and the reduction of the establishment following the end of hostilities. He was still listed a member of 73 Squadron when his name was among those mentioned in despatches by Sir Douglas Haig in his despatch of 16 March 1919, which was gazetted on 11 July. He was transferred to the unemployed list on 20 August 1919. Le Blanc-Smith briefly returned to RAF service, being recommissioned as a flight lieutenant on 9 April 1921, but was re-transferred to the unemployed list on cessation of temporary duty on 5 June. Post-war life Le Blanc-Smith became a director of Bewlay (Tobacconists) Ltd. until retiring in 1959. In 1926 he married Margaret Chance, and they had three children. Le Blanc-Smith died in a nursing home in Lyme Regis in 1986, aged 90.

The Jagera people, also written Yagarr, Yaggera, Yuggara,Yuggera, Chepara-Yuggara, Chepara- Yugara, Ugarapul, Yugarabul, Yuggarapul, and Yugarapul (pul-People that speak Yug[g]ara) are the Australian Aboriginal people who are the Traditional Owners of the territories from Moreton Bay to the base of the Toowoomba ranges including the city of Brisbane (including Ipswich). The Turrbal people are of roughly a group from the north of Brisbane, but referring strictly speaking to a Jagera dialect. This group is one of the traditional custodians of the land over which much of Brisbane is built. Language Yaggera is classified as belonging to the Durubalic subgroup of the Pama‚ÄìNyungan languages, but is also treated as the general name for the languages of the Brisbane area of which Chepara-Yugarapul people have historically been considered a dialect. The Australian English word 'yakka' (loosely meaning 'work', as in 'hard yakka') came from the Jagera language (yaga, 'strenuous work'). The Yaggera language was identified in Petrie on page 319 of his \\"Reminiscences\\" recorded by his daughter Constance, by the traditional language identifier, the word for \\"no\\". Their association with central Brisbane is established by the word for Brisbane, being recorded by Petrie as \\"Mianjin\\". Mianjin is the spike of land from North Quay to Breakfast Creek, and was also known, as was the tribe there, as Miguntyun. Ludwig Leichhardt's Diaries 1842-1843 recorded Miguntyun as \\"Megandsin\\" as the name for the land holding area from Brisbane CBD to Breakfast Creek, and the people who spoke the Yuggara Yugarabul language. Country This group is one of the traditional custodians of the land over which much of Brisbane is built. According to Watson, the Jagera-related peoples in the Chepara tribe inhabited the territories from Moreton Bay to Toowoomba to the west, nearly to Nanango in the north west, including Brisbane and Ipswich. It also encompasses Jimna and its surrounding forests, where their traditional lands adjoined those of the Wakka Wakka and the Gubbi Gubbi (also Kabi Kabi or Gabi Gabi). Subgroups of the Chepara have identified with distinct areas including those concentrated in the Fassifern and Lockyer Creek areas. The Yugambeh and the Bundjalung people bordered them on the south. An Indigenous Land Use Agreement (ILUA) was signed over the site of the historic 1843 Battle of One Tree Hill, now known as Table Top Mountain, when the warrior Multuggerah and a group of men ambushed and won a battle with settlers in the area. The ILUA was signed between Toowoomba City Council and a body representing the \\"Jagera, Yuggera and Ugarapul people\\" as the traditional owners of the area, in 2008. On 25 July 2017, the full bench of the Federal Court decided on appeals of the Turrbal People and the Yugara People, rejecting both appeals and confirming the 2015 decision that native title does not exist in the greater Brisbane area.

O. and G.D. for Henry Overton, 1643 (republished 1865) Relationship with Native people Wequash was the eldest son of the sachem of the Niantic people and some historians presume that his mother was a Pequot. Wequash was also a nephew of Chief Ninigret. In 1637 Wequash and Uncas united with the English under Captain John Mason to fight the Pequots and witnessed the destruction of the tribe's fort by the English forces during the Mystic massacre in Mystic, Connecticut. After the War, Wequash married many of the powerful Pequot women in an attempt to solidify his power.Shawn G. Wiemann, Lasting Marks: The Legacy of Robin Cassacinamon and the Survival of the Mashantucket Pequot Nation (University of New Mexico, Dissertation, 2011), p. 119 http://digitalrepository.unm.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1082&context;=hist_etds Wequash later deeded the land for the settlement of Guilford, Connecticut to Henry Whitfield in 1641.The history of Guilford, Connecticut, from its first settlement in 1639 By Ralph Dunning Smith (J. Munsell, printer, 1877), pg 69 Conversion to Christianity After witnessing the battle, the local historians observed, that Wequash was filled with \\"respect for English power\\" and \\"it awakened a spirit of inquiry in regard to the Englishmen's God, which led him finally to a hearty and influential reception of Christianity.\\" After this experience Wequash returned to local Native Americans as a missionary preaching about Christ for which he was persecuted. Wequash's tombstone in Lyme, Connecticut refers to him as New England's first Indian convert. Many Puritans in Massachusetts such as Governor John Winthrop wrote about Wequash's conversion as the first Native American conversion to Christianity, and New England's First Fruits was published in 1643 describing Wequash's experience.John Winthrop, James Kendall Hosmer, Winthrop's journal, \\"History of New England\\", 1630-1649, Volume 2, Original narratives of early American history, (1642), pg. 69 This was later used to justify the Massachusetts Bay Colony's existence as a mission in evangelizing to Native Americans. In A Key Into the Language of America Roger Williams spoke more skeptically of Wequash's conversion and described how on his deathbed Wequash thanked Williams for explaining Christianity to him at his home in Providence, but Williams still had concerns about whether Wequash had truly been converted. Wequash died in 1642 in the home of Colonel George Fenwick, co-founder of the Saybrook Colony, and there were suspicions that Wequash had been poisoned for his relationship with the English. Prior to his death Wequash requested that his son Wequash be raised by the English settlers,History of the Indians of Connecticut from the earliest known period to 1850 By John William De Forest, Felix Octavius Carr Darley, (W.

She undertook an important voyage to the Pacific Ocean in 1824. She was used for harbour service from 1850 and was renamed HMS Calypso in 1870, before being sold in 1895. Construction Blonde was ordered on 11 December 1812 from Deptford Dockyard, to a new design developed from the lines of the Apollo class. She was laid down in March 1816, and was rated at 38 guns until February 1817. Blonde was launched on 12 January 1819, but was almost immediately laid up in ordinary at Greenhithe from between April 1819 and 1824, when she was completed and fitted for service at Woolwich. She cost a total of ¬£38,266 to build, with a further ¬£15,241 spent on fitting out. Voyage to Hawaii Lord Byron (the 7th Baron, cousin of the famous poet George Gordon Byron) commanded her on an important voyage in 1824. Blonde departed Woolwich, England on 8 September 1824 with the bodies of King Kamehameha II and Queen KamƒÅmalu of the Kingdom of Hawaii who had died while trying to visit King George IV. The Hawaiian Islands had been named the \\"Sandwich Islands\\" in honor of John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich who was the sponsor of the voyage of Captain James Cook in 1776‚Äì1779. The crew included James Macrae, Scottish botanist sent by the Royal Horticultural Society, and naturalist Andrew Bloxam whose brother Rowland was ship's chaplain. Ship's artist Robert Dampier also made several important paintings on the voyage. On 27 November 1824 they arrived at Rio de Janeiro.

On 3 May land was first sighted off the island of Hawaii at Hilo. On 4 May they landed at Lahaina on the island of Maui where the Hawaiians disembarked. On 6 May they landed at Honolulu. A gardener named John Wilkinson had been brought from England to teach agriculture. Before they left England, Governor Boki had agreed to give some land to Wilkinson in the MƒÅnoa Valley, although private ownership of land did not take hold until 1848 in Hawaii. The botanist Macrae left some coffee plants and others he had brought from Brazil. Unfortunately the climate did not agree with Wilkinson, who died in March 1827. Coffee would take many more years to become a successful crop (see also coffee production in Hawaii and Kona coffee). On 11 May a state funeral was held for the late King and Queen, the first Christian memorial service for a ruler of Hawaii. The crew and many of the Hawaiian nobility attended. On 7 June Blonde sailed back past Maui to Hilo, where they had church services on 12 June. For a while Hilo Bay was called \\"Byron's Bay\\" by Europeans. American missionary Joseph Goodrich led a party in an attempt to climb Mauna Kea, the highest point for thousands of miles in any direction. On 15 June they took a canoe to LaupƒÅhoehoe. Although Goodrich did not reach the snow-covered summit due to altitude sickness, a few of the party did on 17 June.

On 25 June a party set out to visit the Kƒ´lauea volcano. They arrived at the smoking crater with glowing red lava on 27 June. Lord Byron visited a few days later. On 7 July they left Hilo and returned to Honolulu by 9 July. On 12 July they left for Kealakekua Bay, arriving on 14 July, where they inspected the place of death of Captain James Cook in 1779. On 15‚Äì16 July they visited the royal tomb called Hale o Keawe at Puuhonua o H≈çnaunau and removed most of the wooden carvings and other artefacts. Byron considered them \\"pagan symbols\\". They constructed a post with copper plate as a monument to Captain Cook, and left on 18 July. On 27 July they crossed the equator planning to go to Tahiti. The crew of Blonde are credited as the first Europeans to see Malden Island, named for navigator Lieutenant Charles Robert Malden on 30 July 1825. They landed on the island, however, and discovered remains of houses. On 1 August they passed Starbuck Island, and landed at Mauke in the Cook Islands on 8 August. On 6 September they reached Valpara√≠so, explored the coast of Chile, and rounded Cape Horn on 29 December. On 7 March 1826, they rescued survivors of Frances Mary and arrived back in England on 15 March. In 1826, Maria Graham published a book based on Rowland Bloxam's journal. The Huntington Library in Southern California holds the original manuscript of Byron's log of the voyage to and from Hawaii in 1824 and 1825 (https://catalog.huntington.org/record=b1706285). Service in China HMS Blonde was involved in a number of actions in China during the First Opium War (1839‚Äì1842) The first introduction of the top-level bureaucrats of the Ottoman Empire to the combination of fork and knife occurred at the ball that took place on the British ship Blonde in Istanbul after the war of 1828‚Äì29.D. G√ºrsoy, Turkish Cuisine, Istanbul, 2006, p. 137) Fate Blonde became a receiving ship at Portsmouth in November 1850. In the 1861 Census she was at Portsmouth, attached to the royal yacht Osbourne, and listed as 'her hulk'. She was renamed HMS Calypso on 9 March 1870. She was sold at Portsmouth on 28 February 1895.

He began his flying career in the Royal Flying Corps during the First World War, scoring seven confirmed victories to become a flying ace and rising to the rank of captain. He continued his service in the RAF, serving throughout the Second World War before retiring in 1946 to devote himself to writing, including several volumes of autobiography. Military career First World War Lee was commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant on 23 February 1915, to serve in the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment. He later transferred to the Royal Flying Corps, and was promoted to lieutenant on 1 July 1917. Posted to No. 46 Squadron RFC to fly the Sopwith Pup, Lee gained his first aerial victory on 4 September 1917 by driving down out of control an Albatros D.V north-east of Polygon Wood. A week later, on 11 September 1917 he shared in the driving down of a Type C reconnaissance aircraft with Captain Maurice Scott and Lieutenants Eric Yorath Hughes and E. Armitage, south of the Scarpe River. Lee, Scott and Hughes repeated this feat ten days later and, the following day, 22 September, Lee drove down another D.V over Sailly-en-Ostrevent. Lee's fifth victory, on 30 September, which made him an ace, was gained over Vitry, driving down a DFW reconnaissance aircraft. He was appointed a flight commander with the temporary rank of captain on 20 November, and completed his victory string ten days later on 30 November, driving down another DFW over Havrincourt- Flesqui√®res in the morning and destroying an Albatros D.V west of Bourlon in the afternoon. Lee was awarded the Military Cross on 4 February 1918, which was gazetted in July: Inter-war career Lee remained in the Royal Air Force (RAF) post-war, being granted a short service commission as a flight lieutenant on 24 October 1919, which was made permanent on 19 March 1924. He was posted to serve on the staff of the Headquarters of No. 1 Group, based at RAF Kidbrooke, on 15 July 1924. On 4 October 1925 Lee was transferred to serve at the Air Ministry, but only stayed there for a month as he was posted to the RAF Depot on 4 November, before being sent to Iraq to serve in No. 5 Armoured Car Company from 18 November, then as a staff officer at the Headquarters of RAF Iraq Command from 16 February 1926. On 1 July 1927 Lee was promoted to squadron leader, returning to the United Kingdom to attend a course at the RAF Staff College, Andover from 16 August. On 17 December 1928 he was posted to No. 10 (Bomber) Squadron based at RAF Upper Heyford, initially as a flight commander, before taking command of the squadron. From 4 February 1931 Lee served on the staff of the Headquarters of the Coastal Area, and on 4 January 1932 was posted to the Air Staff in the Directorate of Organisation and Staff Duties, later serving in the Directorate of Operations until 24 September 1934, and receiving promotion to wing commander on 1 July 1934. In 1935 Lee attended a course at the Imperial Defence College, which he completed in early December, and on 22 December was appointed station commander of RAF Hornchurch. On 15 October 1937 Lee was transferred to the Special Duty List when seconded for duty with the Turkish Government to serve as an instructor at the newly formed Turkish Air Force Staff College. He was promoted to group captain on 1 November 1938. Second World War Lee was released from his post in Turkey in March 1941, and soon after arriving in Egypt was appointed Senior Officer Administration to Air Vice Marshal John D'Albiac, commander of the British Air Forces in Greece, supporting the Greeks following the Italian invasion. Despite early successes the intervention of the Germans soon put the Allied forces on the defensive, and the British were eventually driven out, first to Crete, then to Egypt. For the rest of 1941 Lee served as a staff officer (operations) in the Headquarters of RAF Middle East Command, then as Deputy Senior Air Staff Officer in the Desert Air Force. Lee eventually returned to Britain to be appointed Senior Air Staff Officer of No. 12 Group in RAF Fighter Command, and was appointed a temporary air commodore on 1 November 1942. On 29 December 1942 he was granted permission to wear the insignia of a Commander of the Royal Order of George I with swords, conferred by George II, King of the Hellenes. On 8 June 1944 he received a mention in despatches. In September 1944, following the coup in Romania that brought the country over from the Axis to the Allies, Lee was appointed Head of the Air Section for the British Element of the Control Commission in Romania. On 19 February 1945 he was appointed chief of the British Military Mission to the Yugoslav Government of Marshal Josip Broz Tito, with the acting rank of air vice marshal, finally relinquishing his acting rank on 13 July 1945. Post- war career Lee retired from the RAF on 21 January 1946, and was permitted to retain the rank of air vice marshal. Following his retirement Lee pursued a career as a writer, something that had begun as early as 1917 when he wrote detailed daily letters to his wife, which later became the basis for his book No Parachute: A Fighter Pilot in World War I, published in 1970. While a serving officer Lee has been awarded prizes for essay-writing in 1924 and 1925, served as the first editor of The Hawk, the Royal Air Force Staff College's annual magazine, from 1929, and compiled a history of RAF Hornchurch in 1936. He wrote several works of autobiography, biographies, histories and a novel.

Carried out under the auspices of municipal Communist Party chief Bo Xilai and police chief Wang Lijun, a total of 4,781 suspects were arrested, including 19 suspected crime bosses, hundreds of triad members, and a number of allegedly corrupt police, government and Communist party officials, including six district police chiefs and the city's former deputy police commissioner, Wen Qiang. Time described it as \\"China's trial of the 21st century\\". The crackdown is believed to be the largest of its kind in the history of the People's Republic of China. Concerns over due process surfaced following the trial, including allegations of torture, forced confessions, and intimidation. The trials earned significant media attention for local party chief Bo Xilai, and its implications partially contributed to Bo's downfall in March 2012. Police chief Wang Lijun was also later convicted of abuse of power and went to prison. Background Chongqing had been a center for gang activities prior to the advent of Communism in China. When the Communist Party came to power in 1949, it cracked down on organized crime, almost eliminating it. After liberalization under Deng Xiaoping, gangs made a comeback in the city, this time with associates within the Communist Party. Politburo member Bo Xilai, the head of the Communist Party in Chongqing since November 2007, made \\"cleaning up the city\\" a priority, bringing in trusted outside aides such as Wang Lijun to lead the crackdown on gangs and corruption. Impact and response Over 9,000 suspects were investigated, including 50 public officials. Fourteen of these have been high-ranking officials, including members of the Chongqing Higher People's Court. Several members of the police force have also been detained, including Wen Qiang, the former director of the Chongqing Municipal Bureau of Justice and the bureau's party chief, as well as former deputy police commissioner. By 6 November 2009, over 800 people had warrants issued for their arrest and 327 were prosecuted. The first 31 defendants were brought to trial on 12 October 2009, nine in Chongqing's First Intermediate People's Court and another 22 at the Third Intermediate People's Court. Charges included murder, assault, and operating illegal coal mines. On 21 October, three of the defendants in the first round of trials (Yang Tianqing, Liu Chenghu, and Liu Zhongyong) were sentenced to death, and another three were given suspended death sentences. The other 25 defendants were sentenced to jail terms ranging from one year to life. Bo Xilai, party chief of Chongqing, led the crackdownThe highest-profile defendant has been deputy police commissioner Wen Qiang‚Äôs sister-in-law, Xie Caiping (), reputedly the ringleader of the syndicate and dubbed the \\"Godmother of Chongqing\\". Xie, 46, reputedly kept 16 young men as lovers. She and 22 accomplices were brought to trial on 14 October. During the trial, a judge rebuked her for profanity in her testimony. This, combined with the rumours of her lovers, have increased the public's interest in her case. On 3 November she was sentenced to 18 years in prison for running a crime syndicate that operated illegal gambling dens, illegally locked people up, harboured drug users, ran protection rackets, and bribed police. Though she won a five-year decrease in her original sentence by confessing to her crimes, she intends to appeal the court ruling. On 19 October the 23-year-old twin brothers Zhang Bo and Zhang Tao were arraigned in the Chongqing Municipal Intermediate People's Court with 21 accomplices. On 6 November, each of the brothers was sentenced to serve 17 years in prison, with members of the syndicate receiving jail sentences of between 6 months and 13 and a half years. In March 2010, Chongqing's police bureau saw an upheaval in jobs. On 8 March, the reform was publicized in a plenary conference and circulated on the police's internal website. Many, if not all, of the leadership positions have been opened to competition. Three new deputy directors were named in September 2009 and January and March 2010. Additionally, there are plans to hire over 7700 new policemen in 2010. The trial of Wen Qiang concluded on 14 April 2010, with the Fifth Intermediate People's Court of Chongqing announcing that Wen would be given the death penalty for his crimes, which include accepting bribes, rape, and failure to account for his assets. Previously, the Court had recovered over 30 million yuan ($4.38 million) of Wen's assets, some of which was found hidden in a vault. Other assets recovered included a mansion in the Xiannu Mountain district of Chongqing. The announcement of Wen's death sentence was met with cheers and exuberance outside the courtroom by victims and other Chongqing citizens. Wen's wife, Zhou Xiaoya, confessed to accepting bribes of some 4.5 million yuan, and was sentenced to eight years in prison. Several of Wen's cohorts were also sentenced. Wen Qiang, along with his wife and three others, appealed the decision. Wen lost the appeal in May, when the court announced the clear evidence against him, and he was executed in July 2010. Concerns about due process Some liberal Chinese media sources, including Southern Weekend, Caixin and Sanlian Life Week, have complained that in a rush to secure convictions, authorities are not fully heeding the legal requirements of due process. In December 2009 defence lawyer, Li Zhuang was arrested and accused of \\"coaching his client (Gong Gangmo) to make false claims of torture\\". Li was sentenced to 18 months in prison and barred for life from practising law. On 27 July 2010, another lawyer, Zhu Mingyong, released videotapes of his client Fan Qihang accusing authorities of torturing him almost every day for six months. Fan, 39 years old and accused of running a crime syndicate, had already been convicted and sentenced to death following his arrest in June 2009.Lawyer reveals grim details of client's torture, Ng Tze-wei, South China Morning Post, 29 Jul 2010 Fan said he was beaten, deprived of sleep and placed in stress positions for long periods of time. He said that after he tried to kill himself and bite off his own tongue, guards delayed his medical treatment for two days. His lawyer Zhu hoped to use the video evidence to persuade the Supreme People's Court, which reviewed the case in mid-2010, to reverse the death sentence on his client. Fan was subsequently executed. In the ten months after the fall of Bo and Wang in March 2012, 1235 police officers who had been charged with offences lodged appeals and 70% were declared innocent. Legacy The removal of large numbers of gangsters created a noticeable improvement in public safety but experts and locals think the results are unlikely to be permanent, as new crime bosses are expected to emerge.

Its carapace extends over its legs such that when it pulls in its legs, it resembles a small stone. It lives in rocky areas from the low intertidal to depths of . Description Red specimen Ventral view Cryptolithodes sitchensis has a half-moon shaped carapace extending over all of its eight walking legs and two chelipeds, giving them their common names of turtle crab, umbrella crab or helmet crab. The carapace can be at the adult stage and has scalloped edges. This carapace ranges from neutral sandy colors to bright oranges, reds, and purples. The rostrum extends forwards from the carapace, gradually widening before ending abruptly. From above, only the eyes and second antennae are visible. The ventral side is commonly white in color, and the abdomen is protected by multiple hard plates that lack raised margins. The chelipeds are smooth. The fifth pair of walking legs are located at the posterior and are difficult to distinguish. Range C. sitchensis can be found from southern Alaska to southern California, where they are common. They live within of the intertidal zone along the exposed coasts of the Pacific Ocean. Intertidal species of Lithodidae prefer habitats of cooler temperatures ranging from and temperatures of during larval development. This causes a restriction on their distribution as water temperatures change due to global warming. Identification The distinguishing characteristic between C. sitchensis and C. typicus is that the rostrum of C. sitchensis is wider distally than proximally, while the opposite is found in C. typicus. Also, C. typicus has raised margins of the abdominal segments, while C. sitchensis does not. Life history The larvae of C. sitchensis have six tergites at the megalopal stage. Upon reaching the adult stage, the first and second abdominal segments have fused and the sixth tergite and telson are whole. C. sitchensis males and females have symmetrical abdomens, yet females have a greater number of accessory plates on the left side of the third tergite. Natural history C. sitchensis may be hard to spot due to its rough, rock-like exterior, but it is easily caught due to its slow movements. Found most commonly in the intertidal zone, this species feeds on coralline algae. The reason for the diverse colorations of its carapace may be camouflage with its surroundings. Threats Natural predators of C. sitchensis include larger marine invertebrates, such as octopuses, seabirds, and marine mammals, such as otters. A major threat to C. sitchensis in Southern California is deforestation and its effects on the giant kelp forests around the Channel Islands National Park. The forests of Macrocystis pyrifera form a protective canopy, fostering the ideal temperature for various species that are temperature-sensitive, such as C. sitchensis, and the growth of macroalgae and coralline algae needed for their survival.

Early life Charles Malcolm Kennedy was born in London, the son of James Kennedy, Member of Parliament for Tiverton, and was educated at Blundell's School in Tiverton and at Caius College at Cambridge (where he took two firsts). Diplomatic career Kennedy entered the Foreign Office in 1852. He served chiefly in the commercial branch, attaining the senior clerkship there early in the 1870s. This was his substantive appointment for many years, but he was almost constantly engaged on special services abroad, in particular: *His first deputation (1870‚Äì71) was to the Levant as president of a commission of inquiry into the Consular establishments *British Commissioner in Paris in connection with the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation (concluded with the newly established republic in 1872) *On several occasions questions relating to interchange of commerce between Great Britain and France took him to Paris, the last of them being when he assisted Sir Charles Dilke then Under-Foreign Secretary, to negotiate the subsisting Treaty. *In conjunction with Sir Edward Malet, the arrangements with Italy in 1875 for the renewal of the commercial treaty signed eight years before. *The Joint Channel Tunnel Commission *Commission of commerce and industry at Brussels in 1880 *Senior British delegate to the North Sea Fisheries Conference in 1881 at The Hague (and was appointed plenipotentiary for the signature of the resulting Convention) *Senior British delegate to various international conferences on the protection of submarine cables held in Paris from 1882 to 1886 (Kennedy contributing powerfully to the resulting settlement) *Representing Great Britain at a conference at The Hague for the restriction of the liquor traffic in the North Sea *Representing Great Britain in the negotiations in Paris regarding the Channel Fisheries. Later life Kennedy was appointed Knight of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1893, and retired from the public service in the following year. About this time he was appointed Commander of the Order of Leopold. From 1895 to 1902 Kennedy was lecturer on international Law at University College, Bristol, a number of those lectures being published. Many years earlier he had edited \\"Kennedy's Ethnological and Linguistic Essays\\" and he was also chairman of the Exmouth School Board from 1896 to the dissolution of separate school authorities under Balfour's Act of 1902, and an active member of the council of the Society of Arts.

It was developed by Samsung Electronics. Its name is derived from \\" (bada)\\", meaning \\"ocean\\" or \\"sea\\" in Korean. It ranges from mid- to high-end smartphones. To foster adoption of Bada OS, since 2011 Samsung reportedly had considered releasing the source code under an open-source license, and expanding device support to include Smart TVs. Samsung announced in June 2012 intentions to merge Bada into the Tizen project, but would meanwhile use its own Bada operating system, in parallel with Google Android OS and Microsoft Windows Phone, for its smartphones. All devices running Bada were branded under the Wave name, unlike Samsung's devices that are branded under the name Galaxy, which do not encompass the whole range of Samsung devices running Android. On 25 February 2013, Samsung announced that it would stop developing Bada, moving development to Tizen instead.Samsung scraps Bada OS, folds it into Tizen - FierceMobileIT . Fiercemobilecontent.com (2013-02-25). Retrieved on 2013-12-09. Bug reporting was terminated in April 2014. History Bada and the mobile software distributions to which it is related After the announcement of Bada, the Wave S8500, which would eventually turn to be the first Bada-based phone, was first shown to the public at Mobile World Congress 2010 in Barcelona in February 2010. Alongside Bada itself, some applications running on Bada were exhibited, including mobile videogames like Gameloft's Asphalt 5. The Samsung Wave S8500, released in May that year, sold one million handsets over the first four weeks on the market. According to Samsung, companies such as Twitter, EA, Capcom, Gameloft and Blockbuster revealed their support for the Bada platform by having arranged development partnerships with Samsung since before the launch, and shared a few insights about their vision for the future of mobile apps and how Bada would play a role in it. These were a showcase of what could be heard in a series of events held across the world during the year 2010, called Developer Days. In addition, it was made public the announcement of an incoming Bada Developer Challenge with a total prize of $2,700,000 (USD) throughout the launch event. In May 2010, Samsung released a beta of their Bada software development kit (SDK), making it available to the general public as it had done with partners the previous December, to entice potential developers of applications for this platform. In August 2010, Samsung released version 1.0 of the Bada SDK. A year later, in August 2011, version 2.0 of the Bada SDK was released. Versions The Samsung S8500 Wave was launched with version 1.0 of the Bada operating system. Samsung soon released version 1.0.2, which included minor fixes for European users. The latest version 1.2 was released with the Samsung S8530 Wave II phone. The alpha-version of Bada 2.0 was introduced on 15 February 2011, with the Samsung S8530 Wave II handset. The current flagship Bada handset is the Samsung Wave 3 S8600, running Bada 2.0 Samsung Apps With the release of the Samsung Wave, Samsung opened an international application store, Samsung Apps, for the Bada platform. Samsung Apps has over 2400 applications. This store is also available for Android and Samsung feature phones. Samsung is to remove the Bada brand and market the new OS, Tizen, with its own apps and store. The new store has around 1000 applications for Tizen. Architecture Bada, as Samsung defines it, is not an operating system itself, but a platform with a kernel configurable architecture, which allows using either a proprietary real-time operating system hybrid (RTOS) kernel or the Linux kernel. According to copyrights displayed by Samsung Wave S8500, it uses code from FreeBSD, NetBSD and OpenBSD. Despite numerous suggestions, there is no known Bada device to date that is running the Linux kernel. Similarly, there is no evidence that Bada uses the same or similar graphics stack as the Tizen OS, in particular EFL. The device layer provides core functions such as graphics, protocols, telephony and security. The service layer provides more service-centric features such as SMS, mapping and in-app-purchasing. To provide such features there is a so-called Bada Server. The top layer, the framework layer provides an application programming interface (API) in C++ for application developers to use. Bada provides various UI controls to developers: It provides assorted basic UI controls such as Listbox, Color Picker, and Tab, has a web browser control based on the open-source WebKit, and features Adobe Flash, supporting Flash 9, 10, or 11 (Flash Lite 4 with ActionScript 3.0 support) in Bada 2.0. Both the WebKit and Flash can be embedded inside native Bada applications. Bada supports OpenGL ES 2.0 3D graphics API and offers interactive mapping with point of interest (POI) features, which can also be embedded inside native applications. It supports pinch-to-zoom, tabbed browsing and cut, copy, and paste features. Bada supports many mechanisms to enhance interaction, which can be incorporated into applications. These include various sensors such as motion sensing, vibration control, face detection, accelerometer, magnetometer, tilt, Global Positioning System (GPS), and multi-touch. Native applications are developed in C++ with the Bada SDK, and the Eclipse based integrated development environment (IDE). GNU-based tool chains are used for building and debugging applications. The IDE also contains UI Builder, with which developers can easily design the interface of their applications by dragging and dropping UI controls into forms. For testing and debugging, the IDE contains an emulator which can run apps. Criticism of Bada 1.x Picture being taken using the Samsung Wave 525 running on Bada 1.0 Some publications have criticized Bada 1.x over the following issues: *In the beginning, all VoIP over Wi-Fi applications were banned which meant that popular applications such as Skype could not be used. In March 2011 this restriction was removed, allowing VoIP applications to run on the platform.bada VoIP applications finally allowed ¬´. Joernesdohr.com (2011-04-04). Retrieved on June 24, 2012. *The external sensor API is not open-ended, preventing new types of sensors or unexpected technology developments from being added in the future by third parties. *Due to \\"performance and privacy issues\\", Bada 1.x applications cannot access the SMS/MMS inbox or receive incoming SMS/MMS notifications. This limit was removed in version 2.0. *Bada versions 1.x only allowed one Bada third party application to run at a time. Multitasking applications was only possible between the base applications and one Bada third party application. This limit is removed since version 2.0. *The GPS facility was poor in Bada 1.0. It was further updated in Bada 2.0. *The lack of availability of popular applications was arguably one of the most important factors in the demise of Bada. The lack of developer and consumer support that caused this deficit could not be rectified by the Bada 2.0 update. Bada 2.0 The Bada 2.0 version was shown at IFA 2011 in Berlin and was released in the end of December 2011 with a lot of new functions and improvements compared to version 1.2, introducing features such as: *Full HTML5 support *WAC 2.0 compatibility *Full multitasking *WiFi-Direct technology *Adobe Flash Lite 4 (mobile Flash Player version, supports ActionScript 3.0 of Adobe Flash 10 and 11) *Dolphin Browser 3.0 with download manager *Smart-wallpapers *Text-to- speech *Voice recognition *Vocal commands based on Vlingo *Push notifications *NFC (near-field communication technology) *New security policies and protection functions *New camera manager *New GUI *OpenAL *Inclusion of new proprietary applications and services such as ChatON (instant messaging software), Caster (to share multimedia content and web pages with PC) and Music Hub (a music store similar to iTunes) Devices *Samsung S8500 (Wave) is the only device available supporting Bada at its initial release date.Segan, Sascha.

The year of 1975 was a tough time for India and its democracy. That year, Indira Gandhi, the then Congress Prime Minister of India, declared Emergency on the Country, suppressing civil rights and unleashing a rein of terror. MK Stalin a leader of DMK, was just beginning to step into politics. MK Stalin did not expect it to get as bad as it did end up becoming. C. Chittibabu, decided to accompany MK Stalin as both were taken away to prison. All top leaders were taken under arrest. He (Stalin) later recalled that \\"for that moment, it was comforting to see a few known faces.\\" Having Chittibabu, Arcot Veerasamy, Neela Naryanan and V.S.Govindarajan around helped in dispelling the fear of uncertainty. That relief would never last. Cramped cells, unhygienic floors and walls that served to urinate and heavily salted porridge with chillies for breakfast was enough to break the strongest man. Everyday, C. Chittibabu's family would try to visit and he himself tried his hardest to send letters. MK Stalin was singled out, one night, and was beaten in the most inhuman way by jail supervisors. They had not expected him to live to tell of this. Chittibabu lunged forward and took several of these blows. But they were fatal. In the next couple of days, his health deteriorated. He died shortly. As a result of the sacrifice he made at a young age of 46, he was called \\"Thyaga Maravan\\", the sacrifice that never can be forgotten. Mayor Chittibabu was an avid reader and was interested in the dravidian principles that was preached by Periyar and Peraringar Annadurai. He was very close to Anna as well as Kalaignar karunanidhi and was well respected by everyone. His death came as a shock to thousands of people and for his funeral, many people from all over Tamil Nadu came to Chennai to pay their respect. Mr Chittibabu produced a film titled \\"Nambikai Natchithiram\\" in partnership with M.K. Stalin and casting Mr. M.karunanidhli's son Muthu as the lead character. He also acted in several dramas and was an orator.

The tandem undercarriage proved to be unsatisfactory and there were serious flight stability problems related to the delta wing, enough so that it never flew after an accident during taxiing tests. Background and description A June 1950 Council of Ministers directive ordered Yakovlev to develop a supersonic fighter that used the Lyul'ka AL-5 axial compressor turbojet. Based on a recommendation from one of TsAGI aerodynamicists, Yakovlev was directed to use the rhomboid or cropped delta-shaped wing covered in captured German research.Gordon, et al., pp. 184‚Äì185 The directive was extremely ambitious as it required the maximum speed to be Mach 1.7 at a time when the world speed record was barely over the sound barrier. This requirement had to be revised when the AL-5 was delayed and a substitute engine had to be chosen. No other Soviet turbojet offered the same sort of power as the AL-5 so the project was recast as a technology demonstrator to evaluate the novel wing aerodynamics. The Klimov RD-500 was chosen and the maximum speed was expected to be at a takeoff weight of . The Yak-1000 had a circular-section, semi-monocoque fuselage with the engine air intake in the nose. The engine was mounted behind the pressurized cockpit and exhausted through a long tailpipe in the rear fuselage. Two air brakes were fitted to the underside of the rear fuselage. Forward and rear fuel tanks held and , respectively. The entire rear fuselage and tail could be removed to allow access to the engine.Gunston 1995, p. 482 The small, three-spar wings were the most significant new feature on the Yak-1000. They had an aspect ratio of only 1.46 with 60¬∞ leading-edge sweepback with 51¬∞11' sweepback at quarter chord. The thickness/chord ratio was 3.4% at the root and 4.5% at the tip. The trailing edge was swept forward 11¬∞ and consisted of a full-span flap with an inset ailerons.Gordon, et al., pp. 185, 187Gunston 1997, p. 133 The delta-shaped horizontal stabilizer was set low on the tail and was shaped much like the wing, with 5% thickness. The rudder was tiny, as were the mass- balanced elevators. The tandem undercarriage legs, similar to those of the Yak-50, retracted aft, although the forward wheel remained exposed when retracted. Small outrigger struts retracted aft into underwing fairings set at mid-span. On the ground the Yak-1000 had a pronounced nose-high attitude, and the single nosewheel was steerable.Gordon, et al., pp. 185, 187 Development The prototype was completed on 27 February 1951 and it began taxiing trials on 2 March. On the following day it was taxiing at speed up to , but was blown off the runway when a strong crosswind caused the aircraft to bank which compressed the strut on the opposite side. This forced the aircraft to veer off the runway when the ailerons proved ineffective at countering the bank and the consequent damage forced the testing to be suspended. Some development was done to try to remedy the problems with instability already revealed, but Yakovlev was unenthusiastic about the whole project and it was cancelled in October 1951. The peculiar aerodynamics of delta wings would take the Soviets about another five years of experiments to validate in the Mikoyan-Gurevich Ye-4 prototype of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 and the Sukhoi T-3 delta-winged aircraft which both first flew in 1955‚Äì1956.Gordon, et al., p. 187 Specifications (estimated) References Bibliography * * * Gunston, Bill (1997).

It is a crystalline solid that is soluble in diethyl ether. The removal of two protons yields the acetylenedicarboxylate dianion , which consists only of carbon and oxygen, making it an oxocarbon anion. Partial ionization yields the monovalent hydrogenacetylenedicarboxylate anion . The acid was first described in 1877 by Polish chemist Ernest Bandrowski. It can be obtained by treating Œ±,Œ≤-dibromosuccinic acid with potassium hydroxide KOH in methanol or ethanol. The reaction yields potassium bromide and potassium acetylenedicarboxylate. The salts are separated and the latter is treated with sulfuric acid. Acetylenedicarboxylic acid is used in the synthesis of dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate, an important laboratory reagent. The acid is commonly traded as a laboratory chemical. It can also be reacted with sulfur tetrafluoride to produce hexafluoro-2-butyne, a powerful dienophile for use in Diels-Alder reactions. Fatty alcohol esters of acetylenedicarboxylic acid can be used for the preparation of phase change materials (PCM). Anions and salts Hydrogenacetylenedicarboxylate (often abbreviated as Hadc or HADC) is a monovalent anion of acetylenedicarboxylic acid with the formula or . The anion can be derived from acetylenedicarboxylic acid by removal of a single proton or from the acetylenedicarboxylate dianion by addition of a proton. The name is also used for any salt of this anion. Salts of this anion are of interest in crystallography because they contain unusually short and strong hydrogen bonds. In many crystalline salts (with the exception of the lithium one), the HADC units form linear chains connected by strong hydrogen bonds. Each carboxylate group is usually planar; but the two groups may lie in different planes due to rotation about the carbon‚Äìcarbon bonds. They are coplanar in the hydrated salts and , nearly coplanar in the guanidinium salt , but off by 60¬∞ or more in other salts such as anhydrous . Potassium hydrogenacetylenedicarboxylate is a potassium salt of HADC with chemical formula KC4HO4 or , often abbreviated as KHadc. It is often called potassium hydrogen acetylenedicarboxylate or monopotassium acetylenedicarboxylate. The salt can be obtained from acetylenedicarboxylic acid and is a common laboratory starting material for the synthesis of other derivatives of that acid. In the crystalline form, the hydrogenacetylenedicarboxylate anions are joined into linear chains by uncommonly short hydrogen bonds. Chemical structure of acetylenedicarboxylate Acetylenedicarboxylate (often abbreviated as ADC or adc) is a divalent anion with formula or [O2C‚ÄìC‚â°C‚ÄìCO2]2‚àí; or any salt or ester thereof. The anion can be derived from acetylenedicarboxylic acid by the loss of two protons. It is one of several oxocarbon anions which, like carbonate and oxalate , consist solely of carbon and oxygen. The ADC anion can at as a ligand in organometallic complexes, such as the blue polymeric complex with copper(II) and 2,2‚Ä≤-bipyridine, .

Early career Asscher‚Äôs grandfather founded the Asscher Diamond Company (now the Royal Asscher Diamond Company) in 1854, but it was Abraham and his brother Joseph who built its international fame. In 1907 the brothers opened a new factory at 127 Tolstraat in Amsterdam and soon they received a request from King Edward VII of Great Britain to cleave the legendary Cullinan Diamond, the largest rough gem-quality diamond ever found. Public service Asscher translated his growing success in business into political and community involvement. In 1917, he took up a seat on the Provincial Council of North Holland for the Liberale Staatspartij (Liberal State Party). And in the 1930s, he became a leader and spokesman of the Dutch Jewish community. He served as the President of the nation‚Äôs central Jewish organization, the Nederlandsch-Isra√´litsch Kerkgenootschap (Dutch Jewish Congregation). Therefore, when in 1933 Jewish refugees began to flee in numbers to the Netherlands from the Nazi regime in Germany, it was Asscher, along with Professor David Cohen, who established (with government cooperation) the ' (Committee for Special Jewish Affairs - CBJB). An offshoot of the CBJB, the Comit√© voor Joodsche Vluchtelingen (Committee for Jewish Refugees - CJV), was formed to provide direct service to the refugees. The CJV provided advice and, as needed, financial support to the refugees, and worked to facilitate the emigration of refugees away from continental Europe. David Cohen was the chair of the CJV for most of its eight years of existence. Both of these committees were dissolved by Germany in 1941, and their responsibilities transferred to a Jewish Council. No online access. The Jewish Council It was in this context (see Netherlands in World War II) that the Nazi occupiers later, on February 12, 1941, ordered Asscher and Cohen to head up a new ; the only example of a Jewish Council in the German occupations of Western Europe. The first meeting was held at the Asscher Brothers headquarters in Tolstraat. The Joodse Raad had to mediate the occupation government‚Äôs orders to the Dutch Jewish community and, beginning in July 1942, to help organize the selection of Jewish deportees from the Netherlands to the work camps. In September 1943, most of the remaining staff of the Joodse Raad, including Asscher were deported. Asscher, like most deported Dutch Jews, initially went to the Westerbork camp in the Drenthe province in the east of the country. From there, the Nazis transported him to Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. Postwar Asscher survived his imprisonment at Bergen- Belsen and returned to Amsterdam after the conclusion of the war. Aside from historian David Cohen, who also survived Theresienstadt concentration camp, all other members of the Jewish Council perished, including the Chief Rabbi of Amsterdam . The Dutch government instituted investigations against Asscher and his colleague David Cohen into charges of collaboration. A Joodsche Eereraad (Jewish Council of Honor or Community Tribunal) was also established to investigate wartime collaboration charges on behalf of the Jewish community. It was particularly concerned with activity after August 15, 1942; a point from which, according to the accusers' post-war perspective, it was considered obvious that the Joodse Raad was assisting in a mass-murder of Dutch Jews in German-occupied Poland‚Äôs Nazi extermination camps. However, what was obvious to either Jews or non-Jews in the Netherlands at the time is a matter of considerable historical controversy. The Nazi occupiers went to great lengths to conceal the fate of deported Jews from the Dutch population, including Dutch Jews and the Joodse Raad. In 1947 the Council of Honor ruled to exclude Asscher and Cohen from ever holding public office in the Dutch Jewish Community. By then, Asscher‚Äîdeeply wounded by what he saw as unjust charges leveled against him‚Äîhad left the Community. When Asscher died in 1950 in accordance with his wishes he was not buried in a Jewish cemetery, but instead at the Zorgvlied cemetery. However, in the same year, due to constant protests and appeals, the Jewish community tribunal after reconsidering the charges reversed and annulled its decree to exclude both Asscher and Cohen from official posts in the Jewish community, exonerating them completely. The Dutch government, taking its cue from the Jewish community, dropped all charges of its own the year following.See Ibid., p. 270, also Jozeph Michman, \\"The Controversy Surrounding the Jewish Council of Amsterdam,\\" in Patterns of Jewish Leadership in Nazi Europe, 1933-1945; Proceedings of the Third Yad Vashem International Historical Conference, edited by Y. Gutman and C. J. Haft, (Jerusalem, 1979), pp. 235-258, summarized in Idem, \\"Asscher, Abraham,\\" in The Encyclopedia of the Holocaust, edited by Yisrael Gutman (New York: Macmillan, 1990), Vol. 1: pp. 100-101. Abraham Asscher has been officially exonerated of all charges, even if it came too late for him to know about it. Legacy The actions of Asscher and the Joodse Raad during the German occupation were and are a controversial topic. Hans Knoop, in his history of the Joodse Raad, came to this conclusion: > ‚ÄúThey issued deportation notices and urged the Jews in Het Joodsche Weekblad > to obey these summons to the letter‚Ä¶Cohen declared after the war that > ‚Äòthanks to our efforts no Jew suffered from hunger in occupied Holland.‚Äô > That is the case. But thanks to Asscher and Cohen the deportation of the > Jews in the Netherlands achieved a greater measure of perfection and > efficiency than anywhere else in occupied Europe.‚ÄùAs quoted in: Of course, such accusations benefit from a hindsight that the leaders of the Jewish Council in The Netherlands did not have. Jacob Presser‚Äôs groundbreaking history of the Holocaust in the Netherlands, Ondergang (lit. Destruction; published in English as The Destruction of Dutch Jews, or Ashes in the Wind: The Destruction of Dutch Jews), also criticized Asscher and Cohen, while balancing this with a defense of their good intentions and courageous attempts within the realities of their own perceived situation, to lessen Nazi measures. Presser stated firmly that: \\"No one has accused the two Presidents and the Jewish Council\\" of being collaborators in the strict sense of being \\"corrupt and immoral willing tools\\" of the Nazis, much less as partisans for them, as were the Dutch Nazis, Quislings, Petains and Francos, but the accusations after the war rather were about the degree to which they as victims had naively or mistakenly, despite their best efforts to preserve as much as they could, conceded too much to Nazi pressures to collect together and help to transport the Jewish community to unknown destinations in \\"the East.\\"Presser, p. 271; for a strong criticism of Presser's account of the Jewish leaders as conceding too much to their critics and not putting enough weight on the leaders' courageous attempts to resist Nazi measures, see the review of Presser's book by Henriette Boas in Commentary Magazine, January, 1970. Also see Dwork and Van Pelt, pp. 62-64. Presser, acknowledging that they sought to preserve as many as possible of the Jewish community by haggling numbers deported down as far as possible, even adds,\\"The Jewish Council played for time. Was that wrong? ... Even the most unselfish people would surely have hesitated to shelter and hide Jews if they had known that their self-sacrifice would drag out over so many long years. And it has been said that had the war in fact ended in 1942 the Jewish community would have built a monument to Asscher and Cohen, as the brave and resourceful leaders by whose hands Dutch Jewry was saved.\\"Presser, pp. 272-273. Leni Yahil, in her The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, writes sympathetically of them: \\"While Visser's opposition to cooperation [of any kind whatsoever] with the Germans bespoke a political orientation,\\" (he had led a rival Jewish \\"Coordination Committee\\" that the Nazis had disbanded, which had urged that the Jewish community resist any cooperation with the Nazis and only address itself to the Dutch government, which, according to Yahil \\"ignored the fact that the heads of the Dutch administration were now carrying out orders issued by the Germans\\"), \\"Asscher and especially Cohen invoked the humanitarian principle and believed it was necessary to negotiate with the Germans in order to mitigate the suffering of the Jews through intercession on their behalf. Thus, they essentially held to the approach that had been employed prior to the war to obtain aid for the refugees, except that now they were tending to the Jewish community as a whole.\\"Leni Yahil, The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987), p. 227; Yahil has clarified further, in her \\"Methods of Persecution: A Comparison of the 'Final Solution' in Holland and Denmark,\\" Scripta Hiereosolymtana (Jerusalem) 23 (1972), 279-300, the restraints and real pressures limiting the options of the Jewish Council in The Netherlands. In 1980, the company that Asscher and his brother had brought to international fame and prominence was awarded the Royal title by Queen Juliana of the Netherlands; it is now known as Koninklijke Asscher Diamant Maatschappij (Royal Asscher Diamond Company). Abraham‚Äôs grandson, Edward Asscher, is the current President of the Company. His great-grandson Lodewijk Asscher was the Dutch Minister of Social Affairs and Employment until 2017.

With a friend in 1957, Lautrec created the acrobatic duo, Don and Lee, which performed on trampolines throughout Canada and the United States. He then mixed in the entertainment world by working as a lighting technician, a master of ceremonies in several Montreal cabarets and, for a short time, as a bodyguard to Qu√©b√©cois singer Michel Louvain. He then met impresario Yvan Dufresne, who had discovered Louvain, and asked him to help launch his own singing career. Dufresne accepted and, in 1961, booked Lautrec in the Hotel Central Saint-Martin in Laval, Quebec. That year Dufresne also arranged for Lautrec to record his first 45 rpm, Personne au monde (No One in the World). In the following years, Lautrec became one of Quebec's top pop music stars. In 1964, he popularized the ska, a dance inspired by Jamaican ska with the songs C'est le Ska (That's Ska) and Manon, viens danser le ska (Manon, Come and Dance the Ska). In 1965 and 1966, he grew his success with Tu dis des b√™tises (You're Talking Nonsense), Action and Loins dans ma campagne (Deep in My Countryside) which he sang in the movie Pas de vacances pour les idoles (No Holiday for Idols). In 1966 he travelled to France where he participated in television and radio, and received the Newcomer of the Year Award at the Gala des Artistes. In 1967 Lautrec was selected to sing Expo 67's theme song Un jour, un jour (an English version was also recorded as Hey Friend, Say Friend), composed by St√©phane Venne. That summer his French interpretation of the Procol Harum song, A Whiter Shade of Pale‚Äîtitled Le jour du dernier jour (The Day of the Final Day) -- reached hit status. In the fall, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) sent him to represent Canada at the Sopot International Song Festival in Sopot, Poland, where he won third prize for his rendition of La Manic, and at the International Festival of Popular Song in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In 1968, he toured France with internationally renowned Greek songstress Nana Mouskouri. In 1969, Lautrec definitively abandoned the y√©-y√© style with the release of songs like Eloise, Hallelujah (The Flowers of the Sun) and Hosanna, a French- language interpretation of Neil Diamond's Holly Holy. In 1969 and 1971, this success led to the CBC variety show Donald Lautrec Chaud (Donald Lautrec Hot). In 1972, Lautrec became one of the first recording artists to collaborate with Qu√©b√©cois lyricist Luc Plamondon. Their partnership led to recording the album Fluffy whose track list consists exclusively of Qu√©b√©cois compositions, including Plamondon's Le mur derri√®re la grange (The Wall Behind the Barn), which became a hit in Quebec. Singer-songwriter Claude Dubois also contributed to the album. Despite this success, sales of the LP were somewhat disappointing. Lautrec's success diminished over the following several years and he seemed to gradually withdraw from the entertainment world - his original fan base did not like his new rock style, and rock fans preferred Qu√©b√©cois performers Robert Charlebois or the band Offenbach. But in 1980 he returned to the stage by participating in the retro show, Les 3 L (The 3 L's), with Michel Louvain and Peter Lalonde. In 1981, he released the album Lautrec and hosted Lautrec '81, one of Quebec's first television programs to feature video clips. He returned later with similar programming with Lautrec '82, Lautrec '83 and Lautrec '85. In 1985, Donald Lautrec became the owner of the production company Riviera, which produces Quebec quiz shows such as Charivari, Action et Reaction and Double Jeopardy. He withdrew from the entertainment scene for about twenty years and unexpectedly returned in November 2009 with a new album of songs, Lautrec Forever, which was well received.

In reality the rechargeable calling card is a specialised form of a prepaid or debit account. To use the phonecard, the user would call an access number (which is usually a toll-free telephone number), enter the \\"card number\\" (also called the PIN) and then dial the desired telephone number. The user could add value to the card at the same time as making a call. When traveling, the user has a list of access numbers for various countries, enabling them to call from any phone in most countries and be able to top-up the card. The so-called rechargeable calling card is merely a marketing device, but it is convenient to many users because it is a durable credit card size card. In reality, the system works by a user being provided with a unique \\"card ID\\" (the PIN). After transferring funds to the card company, the ID can be provided electronically by email, by SMS, over the internet, a coupon printed by a cash register at a store, or any other way. Also, as the card balance is actually recorded on the card company's database, topping up can be effected in any manner that funds can be transferred to the company. History Calling cards were introduced in Italy in 1977 and became especially popular in Japan when they were introduced there in 1982. These cards had a set value that could be spent and, once the credit was used, the card would be discarded. Calling cards began to gain popularity around the world and they turned into a multimillion-dollar industry. In an attempt to improve the phonecard, companies started issuing rechargeable calling cards in the early 1990s, also obtainable over the internet, which became the most common phonecard on the market. Recharging Cards can be recharged or topped up in a variety of ways: * Credit card * Cash at convenience stores/corner shops * Swipe card machines * Internet * Coupons * Bank account * Debit card  Japan  Even though the calling card was first introduced in Italy the country that took to the calling card most was Japan, where calling cards were introduced in 1982 by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT). It was an instant hit, selling thousands a day on the subway systems in Tokyo and Osaka, various other companies began to get involved and released their own variants. In 2000, Brastel Telecom released the first rechargeable phone card in Japan called Brastel Card; this time the card was sold in convenience stores across Japan. As the rechargeable phone card took off, more companies began to release cards.  A cardless future  As international travel became cheaper and more people started to travel the international phone card became an essential part of a travelers\` itinerary, previously customers would have to carry one or more cards when traveling and the cards could only be used in certain phones. Phone companies such as Pure MinutesThe Best Way to Make International Calls [SF Gate] began to release \\"cardless\\" phone cards, instead of being issued with a real card, the user will be given a list of access numbers for various countries and a pin which they can use to log into their account. This allowed people to call from any phone in any country and still be able to top-up their credit.

Copenhagen Municipality is divided into 10 official administrative districts but they often comprise areas of a heterogeneous character which are colegually not seen as one district. Some districts have earlier been official subdivisions and thus have semi-official boundaries. Copenhagen postal code designations often correspond to district boundaries but in some cases differ from them, as an example parts of the city centre has the postal code K√∏benhavn V which is generally associated with Vesterbro. Official districts The ten districts of Copenhagen, surrounding Frederiksberg Copenhagen Municipality has ten official administrative districts. They are: Indre By, Vesterbro/Kongens Enghave, N√∏rrebro, √òsterbro, Amager √òst, Amager Vest, Valby, Bispebjerg, Vanl√∏se and Br√∏nsh√∏j-Husum. The districts serve administrative, statistical and tax purposes but are not boroughs since they are not self-governing, electoral or legislative subdivisions. -bro districts In Copenhagen, -bro districts (Danish: Brokvarterer) refers to a ring of dense, residential neighbourhoods surrounding the city centre, named for their common suffix -bro. The -bro districts include Vesterbro, N√∏rrebro, √òsterbro and Amagerbro on the northernmost part of Amager. The inner part of Frederiksberg, though an independent municipality and not sharing the same suffix, is often also considered a -bro district. They developed in the second half of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century after the demarcation line around the city's old fortifications had been released and the fortifications decommissioned. The four -bro districts correspond to the four former city gates Vesterport, N√∏rreport, √òsterport and Amagerport, outside which they rose. Through each -bro district run a -bro street (Danish: Brogade): Vesterbrogade, N√∏rrebrogade, √òsterbrogade and Amagerbrogade. They extend from the location of the old city gates and used to be country roads, leading in and out of town, but as the new districts rose, they were urbanized and turned into busy shopping streets.

One cause of morbilliform rash is an allergic reaction to transfused blood/blood components. In such a case, the skin lesions would develop within a few hours (Approx. 4hours) of transfusion along with pruritus. The condition may even present with other symptoms, such as conjunctival oedema, oedema in the lips and tongue, and even localised angioedema. On rare occasions, the condition may even escalate to anaphylactic shock where pulmonary restrictions are seen. The associated cause for this is a reaction against an allergen that is seldom identified during testing. Transfusing products with anti-IgA antibodies to IgA-deficient patients has also been a suspected cause for such reactions. Management usually relates to the stoppage of transfusion for around 30minutes, until given antihistamines take effect. Transfusion may even be continued after, if no further progression is seen.

Henrie was born Paul McKinley Henrie in Tampa, Florida. He established himself in 1960 in the artist community of Laguna Beach, California, where he lived in a hillside home with his wife and child. Henrie later moved to Carmel, California. Henrie became known for his watercolors and palette-knife oil paintings of California coastal scenes as well as exotic locales he had visited in Tahiti, Mexico and New Orleans. In works prior to 1961, his signature is \\"Paul Henrie\\" or \\"Blaine\\". Afterwards, he signed them \\"Paul Blaine Henrie\\". Henrie was criticized for \\"prostituting his undeniable talent\\" because he readily admitted to sometimes pumping out dozens of paintings only to maintain an expensive lifestyle. Henrie boasted he was the \\"fastest pallette in the west\\" and could produce several paintings in a day. He said he only did it for sale in tourist trap-type art galleries \\"when I need a load of bricks.\\" He said, \\"It may sound crass, but when I hear the bell and see the carrot, I'm gone.\\" Henrie reserved his best work for his collectors and several prestigious galleries like the Grand Central Art Galleries in New York City. Notable celebrities who bought his work included Vincent Price, Frank Sinatra, Princess Margaret, and John Wayne (for whom he created a serigraph titled \\"The Duke\\" in 1979). Henrie also illustrated two books for young adults, Legendary Outlaws of the West (1976) and Legendary Women of the West (1978), and wrote a how-to art book titled Painting in the South Seas. Later years After moving to Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, Henrie made an unsuccessful run for a seat on the city council in 1988. In May 1992, Henrie was arrested for selling more than 30 forged artworks that he alleged were done by Joan Mir√≥, to a Monterey art shop for $42,000. It was ascertained that Henrie was the painter after his palm print was found in the paint of one of the pieces. Henrie only faced one count of misdemeanor forgery because authorities could prove only that one painting was his work. He pleaded guilty in October 1992 and was fined $12000 and faced one year in jail.

Service during World War I He had a deep interest in aviation when he was in his late teens. He pursued a pilot's license, and received a Civil Pilot's Brevet on 7 November 1913. On 23 March 1914, he followed this up by earning Seaplane Pilot's Brevet No. 1. As the First World War kindled, Loste was called to military service on 10 August 1914. Although originally assigned to aviation, he was sent to the infantry on 26 September. Recalled to aviation on 2 January 1915, he began military pilot's training. On 19 April 1915, he was granted his Military Pilot's Brevet. Without additional schooling, he was posted to Escadrille C.56 just nine days later. Loste was wounded in action on 18 June 1915. He was raised out of the enlisted ranks on 17 April 1916, being promoted to Sous lieutenant. On 20 June 1916, he was transferred to Escadrille C46.

At any rate, he would score six more aerial victories by 26 January 1917. On 26 August 1917, he was removed from combat duty and transferred to the Service des Fabrications de l'Aviation. He was seriously injured on 30 September 1917. On 17 April 1918, he was promoted to lieutenant. Assigned to develop tactics on 21 August 1918, he was injured again the same day. Upon his return to duty on 23 September 1918, he was again posted to Service des Fabrications de l'Aviation, where he ended the war. Service after World War I Jean Loste remained in military service after World War I ended. He was promoted to Capitaine on 25 March 1926. When he retired on 1 December 1930, he received a final promotion to Chef de Bataillon. Jean Loste died on 26 July 1960 in Bordeaux, France.

Specifically, the threshold host density (NT) of a species refers to the minimum concentration of individuals necessary to sustain a given disease within a population. Threshold host density (NT) only applies to density dependent diseases, where there is an \\"aggregation of risk\\" to the host in either high host density or low host density patches. When low host density causes an increase in incidence of parasitism or disease, this is known as inverse host density dependence, whereas when incidence of parasitism or disease is elevated in high host density conditions, it is known as direct host density dependence. Host density independent diseases show no correlation between the concentration of a given host population and the incidence of a particular disease. Some examples of host density independent diseases are sexually transmitted diseases in both humans and other animals. This is due to the constant incidence of interaction observed in sexually transmitted diseases‚Äîeven if there are only 20 individuals left of a given population, survival of the species requires sexual contact, and continued spread of the disease. Density dependent diseases are significantly less likely to cause extinction of a population, as the natural course of disease will bring down the density, and thus the propinquity of individuals in the population. In other words, less individuals‚Äîas caused by disease‚Äîmeans lower infection rates and a population equilibrium.

As the population density increases, so do transmission events between individuals. Contact between individuals within a population as it relates to density in sexually transmitted infections File:Sexuallytransmitteddiseasepopulationcontactsgraph.png There is a rapid initial increase in disease transmission as the population increases from zero, and then the plateau of transmission throughout most of the graph. As sexual contact is required in nearly all sexually reproducing species, transmission is not very host density dependent. It is only in cases of near- extinction where sexually transmitted diseases show any dependence on host density. It is for this reason that sexually transmitted diseases are more likely than density dependent diseases to cause extinction.

Initially, the number of contacts between individuals and vectors increases as population density increases. Eventually, however, the advantage of host density diminishes as the density becomes too great for the vector to maintain its natural ecological relationship with the host, and transmission decreases.

The new front would be completed with brickwork and Oxford stone ornaments. He doubted the front could be finished before October.

The four-hour-long shootout was termed as India's \\"first daylight encounter\\" and was videographed and conducted in full view of the public. It ended in the deaths of all seven gangsters, including Dolas, Dilip Buwa and Anil Pawar. Prelude Mugshot of D-Company gangster, Maya Dolas. It was crossed with an \\"X\\" after his death, signifying that he was eliminated. In the late 1980s, the Bombay underworld was under the firm control of the D-Company, headed by Dawood Ibrahim. From his base in Dubai, Ibrahim controlled underworld activities through his various lieutenants. Among the most prominent was Mahindra Dolas, a gangster who was known more popularly by his nickname Maya. Dolas had got his start running several successful extortion rackets for the criminal-politician, Ashok Joshi's gang at Kanjurmarg. On 3 December 1988, Joshi was killed at the Bombay-Pune road near Panvel by a 15-man hit squad led by Chhota Rajan at Ibrahim's orders.How Dawood killed Ashok Joshi ‚Äì 2 August 2003, Express India After Joshi's murder, Dolas later broke out of the Ashok Joshi gang, and formed his own gang. He then convinced notorious Joshi gang sharpshooter Dilip Buwa to switch sides and together on 17 September 1989, they led a stealth attack against the Joshi gang in Kanjurmarg, in which five people were killed. This brought them into favour with Dawood Ibrahim, who was gunning for the Joshi gang after the killing of his pointman Satish Raje. Dolas and Buwa were a feared duo and soon began a steady rise within the ranks of the D-Company. They also conducted extortion activities on Ibrahim's behalf. However, they were also fugitives on the run, with ongoing arrest warrants for them. Dolas, had in fact escaped from prison a few years prior to the shootout. Shootout News and current affairs video magazine Newstrack captured the entire shoot out live in 1991. According to the former Additional Commissioner of Police Aftab Ahmed Khan, the ATS received a tip-off from a police informer that Dolas and his gang were hiding in the A wing, flats 002 and 003 in the Swati building at the Lokhandwala Complex, a posh upper middle class residential area. The informer reported that they were armed and were waiting for a few builders who would be coming in the evening. The apartment in which they were hiding belonged to Gopal Rajwani, a fugitive gangster from Ulhasnagar and associate of Dawood Ibrahim. The ATS formed three teams for the task of arresting the fugitives and taking them into custody. One was for reconnaissance, while the other two cordoned off the spot. What happened next is subject to dispute and controversy. According to the official police version, Officer M.I. Qavi was the first to go there. Qavi spotted Gopal Rajwani at the main gate, but did not arrest him for fear of surprising the gangsters hidden inside the building. On the other hand, Rajwani did not recognise the police officers, who were in their plain clothes, and escaped without any incident. The ATS officers Sunil Deshmukh, Z.M. Gharal and Qavi along with Jagdale and a handful of police officers were the first to walk into the ground-floor apartment where seven of them were watching TV. When they burst into the apartment, six of the gangsters, including Dolas, raised their arms in surprise. Dilip Buwa, who was armed with an AK-47 assault rifle, opened fire on the officers. Officer Gharal, who was not wearing body armour, was shot in the chest twice, puncturing his lungs. Qavi was shot in the elbow. Buwa's brazen attack was soon followed by the others. The ground-floor apartment had two doors, one opening into the compound and the other to the building's staircase. While the police officers came out from the front door, the gangsters escaped into the interiors using the stairs. Khan used the loudspeakers to request residents to go to the kitchen and lie on the floor, to avoid accidentally getting hit by a stray bullet. He also asked the gangsters to surrender, even when half the force was surrounding the building. The gangsters refused to surrender and responded with bullets and profanities. In the ensuing shootout, the police used 450 rounds of ammunition. Every other wall on all sides of the building was rained heavily with bullets. At the end, all seven gangsters were killed, with the last gangster being shot down at the terrace of Swati building. Although post- shootout media coverage made out Dolas to be the main shooter, according to Khan, in reality it was Dilip Buwa. Khan stated that Dolas just kept hurling abuses from inside the building, while the real bullets were being pumped by Buwa: Aftermath The shootout resulted in a great deal of controversy for the ATS. The ATS was suspected of staging a fake encounter and subsequently dragged to court. A magisterial inquiry was ordered as questions were raised on the use of 450 rounds of ammunition and the need for a ‚Äúdaylight‚Äù encounter. The ATS was also charged with walking away with Rs 7 million which belonged to Dolas. Petitions alleging corruption were also filed against Khan. However, the trial ended with Khan and other involving ATS officers acquittal. The fugitive underworld don Chotta Rajan was also extremely vocal in criticising the police operation as a \\"fake encounter\\". According to Chotta Rajan, the encounter was planned by his former boss Dawood Ibrahim, when they were allies, as part of a campaign to downsize Rajan's gang and curtail his power. He further claimed that the ground level co-ordination for the operation was conducted by a Dawood Ibrahim subordinate, Samir Shah. He stated that Dolas had expressed his willingness to surrender, but the police insisted on eliminating him. Khan dismissed the allegations as ridiculous, claiming that Dolas and the others were in no mood to surrender. He asserted that the operation was videographed and it was conducted in full view of the public. He further stated that a public interest litigation claiming that the encounter was stage-managed was dismissed by the Bombay high court. The court even dubbed it \\"vexatious litigation\\". He also justified the shootout, by stating that it had a demoralising effect on the Bombay underworld. In the aftermath of the Lokhandwala encounter, three dreaded shooters fled the city. While Subash Sawant and Subash Singh Thakur fled to Nepal, Anil Parab fled to Dubai. While the Lokhandwala shootout made Khan famous, he later faced criticism about the way he handled the Bombay riots under his jurisdiction. The Bharatiya Janata Party and the Shiv Sena protested his alleged partisan attitude towards their workers in the riots. In 1995, when the BJP-Shiv Sena government came to power in Maharashtra, Khan promotion to the rank of Additional Director General of Police was stalled and he was transferred to Nagpur. Frustrated at this insignificant posting, Khan retired and set up a security agency in 1996, which his son now runs.Meet the man behind the Lokhandwala shootout ‚Äì 23 May 2007, Rediff He also became a politician and joined the Janata Dal, with whom he stood elections in the Mumbai North-west constituency in 1998. Gopal Rajwani, the gangster who had inadvertently managed to avoid being caught in the crossfire, returned to Ulhasnagar and joined politics as a Shiv Sena member in 1995. He was eventually shot dead by four of rival mobster Pappu Kalani's henchmen on 24 January 2000 in the premises of the First Class Magistrate's court there.Sena leader Gopal Rajwani shot dead ‚Äì 25 January 2000, Rediff In popular culture The infamous shootout was immortalised in the 2007 film Shootout at Lokhandwala, starring Sanjay Dutt as ACP Aftab Ahmed Khan, Vivek Oberoi as Maya Dolas, Tushar Kapoor as Dilip Buwa and Amrita Singh as Maya's mother Ratnaprabha Dolas. The movie also featured the real-life former ACP Aftab Ahmed Khan in a cameo role as his superior, the police commissioner Krishnamurthy.. The film was however, criticised by underworld don Chotta Rajan on grounds that it grossly distorted the facts. In a May 2007 interview, he told the Times of India newspaper that the encounter was fake, while the film sought to depict it as an actual event. He stated that he would take it to the film's producer Sanjay Gupta, although when questioned, Gupta refused to pass any comment.

As they still look to her for guidance and support in dealing with their issues, they are able to rely on her when in pain yet battle with being able to move on. Because of the fractured state their family is in, their wounded unit is easily torn apart by outer societal influences. Due to the lack of parenting, each child struggles to cope in unique ways. They are treated harshly by Poppy and are neglected of any true care or concern. As he is depressed himself, he turns to drugs bringing the family to a more desperate state, economically and emotionally. Certain events begin to unfold and proper judgment on behalf of the children is not used. They find themselves teetering with very dangerous situations to which Eleanor would've never approved of. As a result, Uncle Paulo, a neighbor of the family, rapes Blu, weakening the already fragile state of the Ogatas. Poppy, left feeling beside himself, blames Ivah for her abandonment of her younger siblings as she attempted to cross her first stepping stone to independence (i.e. going away to school). As the children have no real support system, and they are constantly combated with troublesome circumstances including racial angst and violence, they are left to feel like orphans as their place in society seems to diminish even further. Ultimately; Ivah, Blu and Maisie, who are still very attached to the presence of Eleanor, are able somewhat move on through the letting go of their dog, Ka-san. Poppy, still unable to cope with the loss of his wife, leaves as well. Although the children are conclusively alone, it seems as a small glimmer of hope in allowing them to reform as individuals. Characters Major characters Ivah Harriet Ogata Ivah is the narrator and protagonist of Blu's Hanging ‚Äì we see the novel entirely through her perspective. Ivah is the oldest of Bertram's three children and acts as a protector and caretaker of Blu and Maisie after their mother dies. Blu's Hanging acts as a coming of age narrative for Ivah, where she transforms into a maternal figure. Bertram Ogata (Poppy) \\"Poppy\\" is the narrator's father. He and his wife, Eleanor, have three children: Ivah, Blue, and Maisie. His wife dies just before the beginning of the novel, but he has not assumed the primary caretaker role of the family. He works several jobs, but his family lives in poverty. Poppy is sometimes rude and abrasive and Ivah often has to take care of him. He lives with leprosy like his wife did.

Major Themes & Motifs The major themes and motifs of Blu's Hanging are centered around the Ivah's and her family members' adjustment and coming to terms with the death of their mother. Through the various themes and motifs, the reader sees how various characters process and accept grief, and the troubles and issues which confront them along the way. Grief: From the very first chapter of the novel, the reader encounters the Ogatas in their moment of deepest and most unconstrained grief. This feeling encompasses the entire book. Poppy's sadness is translated through his repeated singings of \\"Moon River\\", whose whimsical lyrics take on a haunting and troublesome edge when Ivah confesses that \\"I know where he wants to go,\\" and \\"And who the dreammaker is\\".Lois Ann Yamanaka, Blu's Hanging, New York: Harper's Perennial,1997, 3 Her brother Blu eats to control his grief, \\"eating away all the sadness until he's so full that he feels numb and sleepy\\".Yamanaka, Blu's Hanging, 105 Finally, her sister Maisie, turns inward. As a young child, her expression of grief is more physical. The fear and insecurity she feels after her mother's death is demonstrated through her refusal to say more than a handful of words and in the frequency which she wets her panties. Cats: Perhaps the most pervasive of motifs throughout the book is the reoccurring appearance of cats. Ivah's mother teaches her before she dies that \\"Black cats cure sadness. Calico cats bring good luck.\\"Yamanaka, Blu's Hanging, 44 Although the Ogatas adopt a calico-colored cat, Hoppy Creetat, Ivah continuously waits for a black cat to come to her family, to leach away the grief and sadness which has settled over her family, especially her father, following her mother's death. Another focus of the novel, is the treatment of these cats in the Ogata's neighborhood. The Ogata's neighbors, the Reyes, are deemed cat haters or human rats. They seem to derive pleasure from torturing and killing neighborhood cats in various cruel ways. Their torment is especially significant after they hang the newborn kittens from Hoppy Creetat's litter. In many ways, killing Ivah's hope for a black cat to release her family from sadness. Although the book mainly focuses on cats, dogs too play a significant role. Both Ivah and Maisie seem to believe that their adopted black dog, Ka-san, is an embodiment of their mother. Ka-san protects and provides comfort to the Ogata family members, almost in the way that the mythical black cat would. The Ogata children try to understand and find answers to their grief through the various animals which they encounter. While Hoppy Creetat and Ka-san bring them a measure of comfort and perhaps understanding of their mother, other animals such as the dogs kept by Mrs. Ikeda help them to process another kind of sadness and through the sadness, true happiness. Blu composes cartoons and sayings regarding what happiness is. \\"Happiness Is Gunther, Chloe, and Simon after they groom and bathe and stay in the house for on hour of love and play with their friends. When dogs happy, they dream. I seen my dog dreaming she was chasing a rabbit in her sleep. I love dogs.\\"Yamanaka, Blu's Hanging, 125 Finally, cats and dogs are used to seek revenge upon Uncle Paulo, a \\"human rat\\" and child molester. Maisie smears cat and dog feces over his wall at the end, leaving marks which he cannot wash off. Not only do the animals in Blu's Hanging embody specific characters' spirits, they are representative of entire spiritual belief. Consumption and food: Throughout most cultures of the world, food almost always has some relation to grief and death. The very novel, begins with a description of the bread which the Ogatas eat in their initial mourning period. Like many other cultures, the Ogatas are lavished with food following the death of a loved one, however, this supply quickly dwindles and Ivah must learn how to cook for her family. Her descriptions of the food which she learns to cook represent an understanding of the cultural and racial heritage of the Hawaiian islands and the Ogatas. Many of their meals are a mixture of more traditional Japanese elements such as rice with Hawaiian staples like Spam and American concepts and brands. Although the meals are often cheap and quick fixes, they provide the reader with an understanding of the Ogatas' unique place in the world. Their very lack of food comes to represent the family's breakdown and their attempts to bring back a semblance of normality. The most significant example of consumption throughout the book is undoubtedly Blu. As the book progresses, Blu continues to grow in size as he eats his feelings. One of his most frequent snacks is \\"mayonnaise bread,\\" which consists of mayonnaise and various spices slathered onto pieces of bread. Like their other meals, this unhealthy snack is a reminder of the Ogata's economic station and mixed heritage of various races and cultures. However, as the novel continues and the children begin to adapt to their grief and lifestyle changes, their meals generally improve. This parallel between food, grief, and life provides examples of how the family works to hold it together. Maisie eventually emerges from her shell, finally speaking in phrases and sentences while reading directions to make a cake. The reader comes to truly understand the family's relation to each other through what they eat. Coming of age and emerging sexuality:Since the novel is told through the perspective of a thirteen-year-old girl, the reader is not only given a sense of Ivah's coming of age, but of how she interprets the changes in which she sees in the people around her. The book most pointedly discusses the emerging sexuality of Ivah, Blu, the Reyes girls, and Mitchell Oliveira. Although the entire novel is dedicated to Ivah's growth and coming of age, one of the most poignant moments occurs when Ivah first gets her period without the knowledge and support of a mother. At the time Ivah has a crush on Mitchell Oliveira, a neighboring Portuguese boy. Although her crush is dashed, the reader comes to understand the Reyes girls' promiscuity and dark sexual background first through Mitchell's encounters with them. Ivah fears their sexual knowledge, all of which is foreign to her, and she tries her best to protect her brother Blu from them. Unfortunately, as Blue hits puberty and begins to discover his own sexuality through \\"wana underarms\\"Yamanaka, Blu's Hanging, 110 and \\"nocturnal emis-shuns\\",Yamanaka, Blu's Hanging, 159 he is continually drawn to the Reyes who can perform sexual favors which make Blu \\"fly.\\" While the book depicts these first sexual encounters with a certain starkness, the frank tone helps to convey the confusion and fear which Ivah faces in order to come to terms with her own sexuality and that of those around her. Popular culture:Yamanaka's descriptions are permeated with popular culture references. From the significance of \\"Moon River\\" lyrics to cowboy diseases and Clint Eastwood movies to Maisie's favorite song, \\"The Most Beautiful Girl\\". The reader understands the Ogata family's life through these references, what is important to them, what is culturally significant and relevant at the time, and how they relate to and understand these cultural items. The very details of their appearance and actions are given meaning through the labels and brands which they wear and use. Uncle Paolo's \\"Da Sun\\" with black lace panties hanging from the antenna, identify him as the sexual predator that he is. His car, and what he does in his car comes to embody his character. Perhaps most of all, Yamanaka's cultural references help to make the characters real and relatable in a world that is consumed and controlled by cultural dictates. Even on Molokai, which the book claims to be culturally behind, characters can find movies and songs to escape into, to create fantasies around, just like the rest of America. Disease and leprosy:Although the book hints at leprosy at several points, Poppy finally lifts the \\"veil\\" for Ivah and recounts his and her mother's experience with leprosy, and how this led to her death. Through his retelling of his battle with leprosy and his relationship with his wife, it becomes clear exactly what demons Poppy has faced, and both the physical and invisible scars these battles have left. The very island on which they live, Molokai has a deep relationship with leprosy, as it once functioned as a leper colony where the outcasts of society were sent. In a sense, Ivah's description of Molokai and their neighborhood makes it seem as if Molokai could still very well be a leper colony. Their island is so isolated from the outside world, that Ivah even explains it as their culture being \\"five years behind Hilo, and Hilo's five years behind Honolulu, and Honolulu's five years behind the mainland.Yamanaka, Blu's Hanging, 136 Like her parents, Ivah is also somewhat of an outcast, as she is always prone to catching various illnesses. Her father claims that she always catches \\"cowboy diseases\\" such as Hand, Hoof, and Mouth Disease. Although these diseases reflect how the Ogata's live, they also provide a certain identification and nostalgia with the past, both with the Old West and with their mother. Racial politics of local Hawaiian culture: Although Hawaii in general is a culturally diverse and mixed society, the interactions of these various ethnic people is especially relevant in the Ogata's neighborhood. Yamanaka describes a place in which Japanese and Filipino families mix with the \\"portagee\\" and even haole neighbors. These racial distinctions create a certain awareness of class and racial differences. Each ethnicity or minority seems to view the others with distrust or contempt. There is an especially strong dislike between the haole teachers and the more native Japanese teachers, as illustrated by Miss Owens and Miss Ito. Despite the tensions, which this mixture of peoples and cultures creates, the reader comes to understand that this is just one facet of Hawaiian culture and history. Blu's Hanging serves as a critique of these race relations. While Yamanaka has been criticized for her portrayals of different races, the novel does bring to light some of the class and hierarchical issues which do exist. Hanging: From the book's very title, several instances of hanging or references to hanging are markers of significant events within the novel. As the title might infer, most of these instances are related to Blu. In the very beginning Blu accidentally almost hangs himself, then later there is the incident when the Reyes girls hang Hoppy Creetat's kittens. At one point in the story, Blu and Maisie continually play hangman. While their games are indicative of their close relationship and childlike mindsets, Ivah comments that \\"Nobody's hanged yet.\\"Yamanaka, Blu's Hanging, 137 However, Blu does eventually hang for Maisie, the cartoon stick-figure Blu, of course. At the very end, this motif is brought up again, as Blu tries to hang onto the spirit of their mother following his molestation by Uncle Paulo. Later, Maisie seeks revenge by writing a message on Paulo's wall with the words \\"MaLeSTeR, HaNG, i KiLL You, HuMaN RaT.\\"Yamanaka, Blu's Hanging, 251 The image and use of hanging evokes a sense of struggle which is evident throughout the book. All of the characters struggle with different elements of their life, such as grief, sexuality, school, work, etc. Yet, of all of them, Blu is the most caught up within this struggle, at several points almost literally hanging himself. His personal connections and battles always seem to hang by a thread, and in essence, the novel becomes a study of whether in the end, Blu will hang or hang on. Reception and controversy When Lois-Ann Yamanaka's second novel, Blu's Hanging, was released, critics acclaimed that it was \\"powerful,\\" ‚Äúarresting,\\" and \\"brilliant.\\"Foote 1998, p. 63 However, Blu's Hanging quickly became known as a racially controversial work of literature, namely when the Association for Asian American Studies (AAAS) awarded the novel the fiction award, and then revoked it. The controversy centers around one of the Filipino characters in the novel: Uncle Paulo. Although Uncle Paulo is a minor character in the novel, the fact that he is a Filipino rapist and child molester creates uneasiness in the Asian American community: some ‚ÄúAsian American academics‚Ä¶say the character perpetuates a stereotype of Filipino men as sexual predators.\\"Foote 1998, p. 63 The protests from this group were successful in convincing the AAAS to revoke the awarded fiction award. Candace Fujikane, one of Yamanaka's critics, supports the AAAS decision to revoke the award, posing the questions: what if the writer were white and Uncle Paulo were black? ‚ÄúI think it would have been easier for people to understand what our concerns are‚Ä¶because she is Japanese, the flat portrayals seems to come from an unawareness of the difficulties that Filipinos have faced.‚ÄùSengupta 1999, Section E, p. 1 Fujikane argues that Yamanaka's one-dimensional portrayal of Uncle Paulo as a Filipino male reinforces a system of racism that is already operating. The revocation of Yamanaka's award generated a whirlwind of protest among other Asian American writers who accused the AAAS of ‚Äúengaging in censorship in its zeal to strengthen ties among the Asian American ethnic groups.\\"Foote 1998, p. 63 Dozens upon dozens of writers‚Äîincluding Amy Tan and Maxine Hong Kingston‚Äîhave written letters in support of Yamanaka, yet the AAAS refuses to grant an award to a piece of literature that insults the Filipino community. Filipino American poet and novelist Jessica Hagedorn wrote a letter to the AAAS at the pinnacle of the debate claiming, \\"Yamanaka's detractors seem to be demanding that only writers who create safe, reverent, comforting stories are worthy of acknowledgement.\\" She herself would go on to receive similar criticism for her derogatorily titled novel, Dogeaters.Sengupta 1999, Section E, p. 1 Some authors, including Viet Nguyen and Kandice Chuh, argue that the novel itself and the controversy that has surrounded it illuminates the diversity within Asian America. They suggest that \\"conflict is not the problem to be fixed, but the unavoidable condition of panethnicity.\\"Russell 2006, p. 76 In her novel, Yamanaka addresses the very phenomenon that has spurred such critical debate: particularities with the panethnic nature of Asian America. Erin Suzuki argues, \\"As such, what Blu's Hanging, as both a text and a controversy, ultimately represents is the complex moment at which a minority group-in this case, local Asian Americans-begins to reproduce the dominant discourse that has consumed them.\\"Suzuki 2006, p. 49 From an author's perspective, Yamanaka expressed concerns about the implications this controversy has on her future as a writer: ‚Äú‚ÄòThis has frightened me,‚Äô she says. ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs gotten very personal. The distinction between the narrator and the author is not being made. People are telling me how to write. The critics have crept into my room and are peeping over my shoulder.‚Äô‚ÄùFoote 1998, p. 63 Notes References * *. *. *. *.

History Construction of the line began in the late 19th century with the purpose of transferring produce from the Victoria's Western District to the industrial centre of Ballarat. The line was built in sections, from Irrewarra in the south to Beeac, and from Ballarat in the north to Newtown, as part of the Skipton Line. The link between Beeac and Newtown was eventually opened in the 1910s, but it passed through very few major settlements.

From the closing of the Colac-Ballarat line in 1953, the station was progressively downgraded, and it was closed in the 1990s. Today almost no trace of the station remains.

After serving as First Lieutenant from 1943 to 1946 in the segregated United States Army in World War II and being honorably discharged, he received a BA from Harvard College in 1948 (cum laude in Social Relations), was accepted into the Harvard Graduate School of Arts and Sciences (GSAS) before transferring to receive a MFA from the Yale School of Drama and a Ph.D. (Divinity with pastoral sacred storytelling) from the Union Institute, having delivered his doctoral presentation at Boston's Deer Island Prison, accompanied by a 25-piece jazz orchestra, with a video recording for his dissertation committee's further consideration. While performing frequently at U.S. National Storytelling Festivals and flown abroad by organizations and patrons from England to Russia and the Bahamas, Brother Blue regularly performed on the streets around Cambridge, most notably in Harvard Square. He was the Official Storyteller of Boston and of Cambridge by resolutions of both city councils.Brother Blue on Street Storytelling  The Art of Storytelling Show Brother Blue was a 2009 recipient of the W. E. B. Du Bois Medal from the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute at Harvard University, named for William Edward Burghardt Du Bois, the first African American to earn a Harvard PhD in 1895. Brother Blue's award was accepted posthumously on his behalf by his spouse, Ruth Edmonds Hill, oral historian at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard University, on December 4, 2009. In his performances and in private communications, Brother Blue frequently exhorted people to tell \\"stories that change the world,\\" with the combination caveat-encouragement, \\"We want a story from your heart. If it's not from your heart, don't tell it.\\"In the footsteps of Du Bois  Harvard Gazette Youth and early career Raised in the boisterously revivalist African Methodist Episcopal church of the 1920s and 1930s, young Hugh was the grandson of a slave who heard tales of his grandfather's slavery from his father, who was a devout Christian. The Hills lived in a poor area in Cleveland, Ohio as one of the few black families in their neighborhood. Brother Blue recalled his childhood as a rough time, saying \\"I'm like a flower who grew up in rocky soil.\\" During Sunday church services, Blue found his voice telling stories, carrying this art forward into Sunday school sessions he taught after prayer.The Story of Brother Blue Entering Harvard on scholarship, Brother Blue won the undergraduate Boylston Prize for his recital of a speech penned and originally orated by Haitian slave rebellion leader Toussaint L'Ouverture. He subsequently won the Walt Whitman International Media Competition for delivering selections from The Autobiography of Malcolm X. Inspired by American Civil Liberties attorney Clarence Darrow of Scopes Trial, son of an abolitionist family, Brother Blue initially intended to apply to law school in order to become \\"the black Clarence Darrow.\\" However his storytelling calling brought him successfully to Yale School of Drama's graduate school instead before obtaining his doctorate in Divinity from the Union Institute.The Age-Old Teachings and Joyful Beseechings of Brother Blue  News  The Harvard Crimson Iconography Morpho menelaus blue butterfly Brother Blue and Ruth's ubiquitous symbol is the blue butterfly, usually styled in the wing and scale patterns of the densely blue or solid blue morpho native to South America yet admired around the world for its over 80 species, a globe-spanning welcome totem. Personally dedicated to improvisation, Brother Blue welcomed variation in its styling, acknowledging its ancient Greek association with the diversities and flights of psyche. In the later part of his career, Brother Blue constantly wore a broad breast-plate sized medallion suspended around his neck which was a gift among the butterfly tokens with which people expressed their appreciation and affection for the Hills. Even then, many other butterflies from the myriad he wore through his career bedecked his whole body, and blue butterflies were frequently painted on cheeks and in the palms of his hands, with blue ballpoint pens when no other cosmetic was handy; blue butterflies in his palms are featured in his role as Merlin in the 1981 George A. Romero film Knightriders and the camera zooms in on his butterfly hand sadly and poetically waving goodbye at the camera during a funeral at which he officiates in the film.Knightriders directed by George A. Romero (1981) The morpho butterfly or large, fanciful blue hued lepidoptera grace Brother Blue's publications, media jackets, festival banners, ornamental staff, and stages. The story of a caterpillar's struggles, hopes and dreams and metamorphosis into a butterfly was one of Brother Blue's signature motifs. Usually sporting a close-fitting hat, Brother Blue particularly favored a blue beret on which butterfly pins, some with rhinestones or sea opals, were affixed. He wore a sash emblazoned with \\"BROTHER BLUE STORYTELLER\\" in his capacity as Official Storyteller of Cambridge, Massachusetts.City of Cambridge, Massachusetts resident and tourist printed brochures 1970s-2000s and website Lacing his shoulders, arms, elbows, wrists, knees, ankles and elsewhere were often curling ribbons, and he was known to carry bright blue balloons with his predominantly blue ensemble, underlying his finery with blue turtlenecks or collared shirts and blue pants. In the Judaic and Vedic and African traditions, he often appeared barefoot or would take off his shoes in the early course of a performance to touch earth as sacred ground. Brother Blue's 2002 business card read \\"Storyteller, Street Poet, Soul Theater\\".Spinning a Blue Yarn  FM  The Harvard Crimson Opus Brother Blue performing in Harvard Square circa 1979 \\"From the middle of the middle of me,\\" Brother Blue would say, swirling his finger in magical airs in the space between you then gently tapping it toward your heart, \\"to the middle of the middle of you ...\\" And he would say with growling resonance, \\"I am older than the oldest stories, I am the storyteller.\\" A signature story which gave form to one face of this archetypal \\"storyteller\\" from Blue is his tale of Muddy Duddy, a fictional musician who could hear the sound of a harp coming out of the earth.Harvard Storytelling Workshop, 1980 Brother Blue's unique style of storytelling made extensive use of rhyme, rhythm, and improvisation, creating a verbal jazz of words and images. He referred to himself as a street poet and, in the same words as Saint Francis of Assisi, as \\"God's fool\\". He told idiosyncratic versions of Shakespeare's King Lear, \\"The Big O, Othell-O\\" and Romeo and Juliet, a variety of self-mythologizing autobiographical stories, and always his signature story about a caterpillar's first vision of a butterfly. MacArthur Fellow, Salzburg Festival bad boy wunderkind of re-visioned theatrical works Peter Sellars (Harvard College Class of 1981) cast Brother Blue as an idiosyncratic actor in updated classical productions in such venues as The American Repertory Theater. As an educator, Brother Blue taught at the Episcopal and Harvard Divinity Schools, then with Ruth Hill in the Harvard Storytelling Workshop held in venues across Harvard University's campus, on television through WGBH, and in his most casual later forum, Storytelling with Brother Blue. The epic in the human situation, fundamental issues of birth, love, loss of siblings, anguish, death, subjective ugliness, impairment, imprisonment, divinity, freedom, imagination, daring, yearning, and the discontent which transforms social roles, conveyed through the most ancient of story cycles, African and Franco-Welsh legend, Shakespeare, modern jazz interpretations, and post-post-modern improvisation reaching directly to epic gestalt through even humble incidents are an enduring weight in Brother Blue's compositions, performance, professing in academia and in practica. Often these grand themes would pour through picaresque characters, though also through socially high profile characters portrayed such as Othello or unnamed archetypal personalities such as the Old Storyteller or This Little Girl or Someone Who's Somewhere Everywhere.Harvard University, 1940s, Harvard Storytelling Workshop, 1950s-90sGilgamesh, God King of Sumer, The Oldest Story in the World (1990s) Heuristics and story coaching methodology With great controversy, Brother Blue's refusal, at a phase of his evolution, to give grades to graduate students in university courses he taught, and then his formal adoption of an ethic of not \\"criticizing\\" in the usual senses but effusively \\"appreciating\\" and mainly \\"saying thank you\\" in response to performances he proctored, coached, or judged, set him even farther along the liberal humanist spectrum of oral storytelling critiquing whose kindly edge was otherwise defined in his later lifetime by the work of Doug Lipman's guidelines for Story Dynamics coaching, which filled out further in the eulogistic direction of Brother Blue's radical stance by Lipman's middle period schema in his collaboration with Jay O'Callahan among Brother Blue's internationally influential League for the Advancement of New England Storytelling (LANES) colleagues who treat this subject systematically within the oral storytelling field as well as in corporate consultation toward realizing human potential.The Storytelling Coach: How to Listen, Praise, and Bring Out People's Best, Doug Lipman, Jay O'Callahan (1995) Cautious of \\"the green dance\\" himself, Brother Blue eschewed the world of commerce and economics as much as the formality of numericalized aptitude assessment, and explained that he preferred to address people \\"in their wonderfulness\\" regardless of their situation and the tentativeness of their product and expression, calling on their individual superlativeness.Harvard Storytelling Workshop (1986) Improvisation was a pervasive element in Brother Blue's performances and one of the chief skills he nourished in others.Harvard Storytelling Workshop, 1950s-1990s, Storytelling with Brother Blue, 2000s \\"I call it cosmic jazz. I don't repeat myself, I don't write it down, you can't get it in a book, in a book\\" he said (2008). from clips at the National Association of Black Storytellers Festival in Atlanta, Georgia (2007) and in Cincinnati, Ohio (2008). In the early and middle parts of his career, Brother Blue practiced Calling the Muse to open any gathering of storytellers or storytelling.Harvard Storytelling Workshop, 1950s-1990s Tradition strands  = Universal traditions = Universal themes, lore, personalities, motifs and penumbra referenced in Brother Blue's opus include: caterpillar, metamorphosis and butterfly (which gave its ancient Greek sense to modern concepts of psyche)Harvard Storytelling Workshop, 1970s-1990s, Storytelling with Brother Blue, 2000s, Cambridge Community Television 1980s-2000s Brother Blue believed that telling stories is a divine calling. \\"I think I was anointed to be a storyteller‚ÄîI mean touched by the fire,\\" he said. \\"I can tell stories in my sleep and blow the world away!\\" Avowing that he was \\"working on greatness!\\" he described what he sought from everyone as \\"stories to change the world.\\" He declared that \\"Love will overcome all in this world.

They want to be amused mostly, or have a way of passing a little time. Not Blue. Even when I'm trying to be funny, I'm trying to give you my soul. That's strong\\". = Music and song and the European bardic tradition = Brother Blue's chief musical instruments were harmonica and human voice, and occasionally tambourine, drums, and the gnashing of chains, featuring genuine early American slave chains he used in an early signature story developed in performance to his class while he was a Divinity School teaching fellow. Finger snapping, stomping and dancing, often barefoot, are featured in many of his performances.Harvard Storytelling Workshop, 1950s-1980s At Harvard, Brother Blue studied under Albert Bates Lord who was, with Milman Parry, among the coterie of those who compared the methods of the most venerable surviving contemporary Slavic and Eastern Mediterranean bardic tellers of traditional sagas with the language and content and literary formats of the Homeric epics, concluding that Homeric works derived from or were transcribed out of oral storytelling forms, as ultimately documented in The Singer of Tales (1960)Alfred B. Lord, The Singer of Tales (1960; New York: Atheneum, 1974) These were themes in global mythography, contemporary with work such as that of Marija Gimbutas and Joseph Campbell which Brother Blue addressed in his training of others. Albert Lord's 1954 class also led Herbert Mason to write his intensely personal Gilgamesh, A Verse Narrative (1970) as Mason's own bosom young friend lay deathly ill, and which was narrated for accompaniment to the international museum exhibit, Treasures of the Royal Tombs of Ur, with dedication to both Mason and the Hills by a student of Brother Blue and Ruth Hill as Gilgamesh: God King of Sumer, The Oldest Story in the World, along with Diane Wolkstein's portrayal of Inanna. Brother Blue also advised a live, partially extempore performances of the Gilgamesh and Inanna cycle for this exhibit at the Bowers Museum in Santa Ana, California. Professor Albert Lord said that Brother Blue was \\"sui generis,\\" meaning in Latin \\"of a kind of his own\\" because Brother Blue \\"does not really belong to any particular tradition in storytelling\\" but is \\"a phenomenon in himself.\\" Like the bards throughout the ages, Brother Blue was f√™ted by titular nobility; he is known for the poignancy of his autobiographical tale of telling stories to enthrall, cheer, and uplift an English Duchess, and his feelings of guilt and dismay upon learning of her suicide on the coattails of his departure, wondering \\"if only\\" he could have told her just the one more thing, given her the one more smile into her soul...Harvard Storytelling Workshop, 1985 European-related themes, lore, personalities, motifs and penumbra referenced in Brother Blue's opus include: Albert Einstein, Homer, Vergil, Dante, William Shakespeare and personal favorites St. Francis of Assissi and Don Quixote, to all of whom he would compare his own, his colleagues' and his audiences' works and lives. \\"I bring Homer to the streets. I bring Sophocles,\\" he said. \\"To tell stories, you should know Chaucer. You should know Shakespeare. You should know Keats. You have to be constantly reading. You read, you think, you create. You have to know the new moves: You must be able to rap and be able to sing the blues!\\". = United States pan-cultural traditions = United States historical and cultural themes, lore, personalities, motifs and penumbra referenced in Brother Blue's opus include: Bob Dylan, John Coltrane and Robert F. Kennedy. Brother Blue said he wanted to be \\"the black Clarence Darrow,\\" which is why he had intended to go to law school before finding his calling at Yale School of Drama.

Brother Blue has been frequently featured by the U.S. National Association of Black Storytellers and is frequently referenced by the U.S. griot movement, spearheaded by such oral storyteller griots as Michael D. McCartyMichael D. McCarty - Have Mouth.

An apprentice of Brother Blue and Ruth's was welcomed with a name in the family of Purna Das Baul Samrat, like Blue crossed over into film actor and celebrity status through contributions in his own generation as pater familias of the Bauls of Bengal, a once home- shunning caste of storytellers who similarly fuse several religious traditions; and Brother Blue and Ruth Hill contributed to early initiatives to unite storytellers globally through organizations departing from this and other links. Telescoping Brother Blue's spiritual perspective is his recounting, included in Brother Blue: A Narrative Portrait, of spontaneously piling up a Jacob's ladder of chairs and climbing to the top of them wordlessly upon invitation of a distinguished Harvard lecturer in advanced Indian philosophies, to personify what was beyond words, as Brother Blue explains. Humanistic feeling for God recognized in our fellow creatures was increasingly emphasized in Brother Blue's personal work in his latest years, as he continued, with his wife Ruth, to encourage the fruition of storytelling both abroad and always in their own neighborhood community.Brother Blue: A Narrative Portrait of Brother Blue A.K.A.

Shortcomings was originally serialized in issues #9 through #11 of Tomine's comic book series Optic Nerve before being released as a whole in 2007. It was also excerpted in Timothy McSweeney's Quarterly Concern #13. Plot summary Adrian Tomine's graphic novel Shortcomings is his only work that fully deals with themes of being a young Asian-American male in American society. Ben Tanaka, the story's protagonist, lives in Berkeley, California with his politically active girlfriend Miko Hayashi. Ben is uninterested in Miko's participation in the Asian-American cultural community, but he possesses a wandering eyespecifically for Caucasian women. When Miko begins to resent what she interprets as a rejection of both her Asian heritage and of herself, she moves to New York, at which point Ben disastrously attempts to pursue the type of woman he feels he really wants. In Sandra Oh's essay \\"Sight Unseen: Adrian Tomine's Optic Nerve and the Politics of Recognition\\".,\\"Sight Unseen: Adrian Tomine's Optic Nerve and the Politics of Recognition\\" published by The Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States (MELUS), Oh writes that Tomine, like his character Ben Tanaka, is more or less \\"pessimistic about the possibility of escaping the limitations of socially inscribed identities.\\" Throughout the novel we see this pessimism manifest in Ben's general rejection and resentment of things that attempt to, in Ben's words, \\"make some big 'statement' about race.\\" At the same time, Shortcomings does deal with racial issues, but it attempts to do so without resorting to clich√©s. Critical reception Entertainment Weekly has frequently praised Tomine's work, and Shortcomings was no exception. In 2006, Entertainment Weekly published a short review of Tomine's work in their article.\\"The Mix\\", which lists \\"What not to miss in Music, Books, Games, and more‚Ä¶\\". They wrote: > Optic Nerve comics prodigy Adrian Tomine has built a loyal following off the > slice-of-life Nerve since '91. His latest arc (issues 9-11) follows moody > movie-theater owner Ben Tanaka, who struggles to hang on to his Asian > girlfriend while secretly lusting after white ladies. He's sad and somewhat > despicable, and yet Tomine, being the understated virtuoso he is, > effortlessly spins him into a Gen-X hero. In 2007, Entertainment Weekly placed Shortcomings on their list of \\"Autumn‚Äôs most eagerly awaited new books.\\" After its release, critic Ken Tucker gave Tomine's novel Shortcomings an \\"A\\" grade, calling it a \\"graphic narrative as piercingly realistic as any prose fiction.\\" In \\"World Literature Today\\", David Shook of the University of Oxford called Tomine's drawing in Shortcomings \\"characteristically clean and succinct\\" and praised the novel's success in asking questions \\"important enough to make raising them a notable effort in itself.\\" Shortcomings was also named to multiple Best of 2007 lists for both books in general and graphic novels, including those from Publisher's Weekly, the New York Times, and Amazon.com. Tomine has not completely escaped criticism, however. As Derek Parker Royal wrote in MELUS; \\"Tomine‚Äôs resistance to racialized identity in his works, for which some Asian-Americans have criticized him, is called into question by his recent efforts to confront Asian-American subject matters. As a result, one can read his semi- autobiographic comics as a chronicle of the limits and responsibilities of ethnic representation.\\" \\"Introduction: Coloring America: Multi-Ethnic Engagements with Graphic Narrative\\" References Category:2007 graphic novels Category:Comics by Adrian Tomine ","title":"Shortcomings (comics)"},{"id":"25031262","text":"Proctonotus is a genus of sea slugs, or more accurately nudibranchs, marine gastropod molluscs in the family Proctonotidae.WoRMS (2011).

Wootton, David (1992). Atheism from the Reformation to the Enlightenment. Oxford University Press. pp. 33, . According to Brill's Encyclopaedia of the Neo-Latin World, the Theophrastus redivivus is \\"a comprehensive statement of atheism and materialism that seems, in effect, timeless. Unlocalized in time or place, Latin confers a kind of scandalous universality or ubiquity on the most heterodox propositions.\\"  Contents  Theophrastus redivivus is famous for proclaiming that all the great philosophers, including the eponymous Theophrastus (ancient Greek philosopher c. 371 ‚Äì c. 287 BCE, successor of Aristotle), have been atheists; religions are contrived works of men; there is no valid proof for the existence of gods, and those who claim experience of a god are either disingenuous or ill. However, unlike the Treatise of the Three Impostors, another anti-religious work published around the same time, Theophrastus redivivus was never mentioned by the Age of Enlightenment philosophers and thinkers of the next century, despite being one of the first explicitly anti-religious works ever published in modern Europe.  Structure  Theophrastus redivivus is divided into a preface (\\"prooemium\\") and six treatises (\\"tractatus\\"), also called books (\\"libri\\"). Every treatise is subdivided into multiple chapters (\\"capita\\").Tractatus primus, Caput 1-6 # Tractatus primus qui est \\"de Diis\\" ‚Äì On the Gods # Tractatus secundus qui est \\"de Mundo\\" ‚Äì On the World # Tractatus tertius qui est \\"de religione\\" ‚Äì On Religion # Tractatus quartus qui est \\"de anima et de inferis\\" ‚Äì On the Soul and Hell # Tractatus quintus qui est \\"de contemnenda morte\\" ‚Äì On the Contempt of Death # Tractatus sextus qui est \\"de vita secundum natura\\" ‚Äì On the Natural Life  Surviving manuscripts  Today, only four copies are known to survive: one in the French National Library in Paris (donated by Claude Sallier in 1741, who allegedly bought it from the auction of Karl Heinrich von Hoym's estate in August 1738), two in the Austrian National Library in Vienna, and one owned by a Belgian professor. The Italian scholar Tullio Gregory studied the treatise in his Theophrastus redivivus. Erudizione e ateismo nel Seicento (Naples 1979), and in 1981 his colleagues Gianni Paganini and Guido Canziani edited and published the text. The latter two have shown that the two Austrian manuscripts from the Hohendorf collection belonging to Prince Eugene of Savoy are probably older, based on an earlier original, and that Parisian and Belgian manuscripts are copied from Prince Eugene's holdings.  Hessling's 1659 Theophrastus redivivus  The manuscript shares its title with another, printed book also titled Theophrastus redivivus, which was published in Frankfurt by an Elias Johann Hessling in 1659. The 1659 book, written in German and defending the Swiss German Renaissance scientist and occultist Paracelsus, has no connection to the anonymous work. It is unknown which work predates the other, and why the two books share the same title; neither work mentions the other. However, Latin book titles with a personal name from classical antiquity followed by \\"redivivus\\" were somewhat common in the 17th and 18th century.

His work in organic and inorganic chemistry influenced the development of coordination chemistry. Geuther spent most of his academic career at the University of Jena where he discovered ethyl acetoacetate, a key compound for chemical synthesis and for the discovery of tautomerism. Life Geuther was born in Neustadt bei Coburg and was educated in Neustad, Coburg and Saalfeld. Although his family favoured education in the merchant business, he started to study chemistry at the University of Jena, but changed to the University of G√∂ttingen in 1853. He received his PhD in 1855 for a work on oil shale carried out together with Friedrich W√∂hler. In the following years, he gradually improved his position in G√∂ttingen and became professor in the University of Jena in 1860. In 1883 he married and lived until his death with his wife, son and daughter in Jena. Geuther died of typhus in 1889 at the age of 57. Work Geuther started to work on inorganic topics, such as the electrolysis of chromic acid and sulfuric acid to determine the similarities of the two compounds. His research on the constitution of several cobalt amine complexes, such as hexamminecobalt(III) chloride, were later completed by Alfred Werner earning Werner a Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Some of his organic research was connected to isomerism of chemical molecules. The experimental work on the hydrolysis of 1,1-dichloroethane, which yielded glycol, and the chlorination of acetaldehyde giving 1,2-dichloroethane provided a good starting point for the development of the theory of the constitution of compounds with the same chemical formula, but different bond structure. Tautomeric forms for ethyl acetoacetate (for R = methyl and R' = ethyl) Geuther is best known for his discovery of ethyl acetoacetate. Although he discovered the compound in 1863, it took him two years to publish results in a peer reviewed journal. The experimental work of his and others yielded puzzling results and induced debates on the nature of ethyl acetoacetate. The structure proposed by Edward Frankland and Duppa showed a keto group (C=O), while Geuther was certain about presence of an acidic OH group in the molecule. It was long after the death of Geuther when Ludwig Knorr, Geuthers successor at the University of Jena, solved the riddle proving both sides right: the true nature of ethyl acetoacetate was a tautomeric equilibrium between the both suggested structures. The Keto-enol tautomerism strongly depends on the solvent used for the experiments. Geuther was planning to build a new chemical laboratory at University of Jena, but died well before the construction had started. Some of his unfinished work was completed by his successor in Jena Ludwig Knorr.

A large village, known as Partacsi, was located in this general area. An expedition led by Colonel Juan Bautista de Anza passed through this area in March 1776 as he forged the first overland route from Monterey to San Francisco Bay. Mission Santa Clara de Asis was founded in October of the same year, where many of the local Indians were taken. Governor Alvarado granted Rancho San Antonio de Padua to Juan Prado Mesa in 1839. This rancho was bounded by Adobe Creek to the north and Stevens Creek to the south, and included Permanente Creek.

Mesa had been a soldier at the Presidio of San Francisco since 1828, served as a corporal in the Santa Clara Guard, and had won fame as a soldier and Indian fighter. Mesa died in 1845. Permanente Creek is also the namesake for Kaiser Permanente. Bess Kaiser and her spouse, industrialist Henry J. Kaiser, had a lodge on the creek's headwaters above the large Permanente Quarry and Cement Plant, and, in 1945, Bess felt that the name of their attractive and dependable stream would be a good name for their medical program at the shipyards. That medical program became Kaiser Permanente. Accessed September 8, 2009 Watershed Permanente Creek consists of approximately of channel draining a watershed area of . From its origination at in headwaters protected by the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District just north of the peak of Black Mountain (and just east of the Black Mountain Trail), Permanente Creek descends along the Permanente Quarry (currently known as the Lehigh Southwest Cement Plant and Quarry), and continues easterly through unincorporated County land for about five miles (8 km), then turns to the north at the base of the foothills and continues another eight miles (13 km) along the valley floor. It has two major tributaries, the West Fork Permanente Creek and Hale Creek. West Fork Permanente Creek and its Wildcat Canyon tributary were formerly known as Ohlone Creek. West Fork Permanente Creek begins on the east side of Ewing Hill, and runs easterly until it reaches the connector from the Chamise and Rogue Valley Trails where an earthen dam forms High Meadow Pond (aka Rogue Valley Pond). Below the pond, the West Fork is joined by long Wildcat Canyon Creek at Deer Hollow Farm, then continues on its run ( total) to the Permanente Creek mainstem which it joins south of Interstate 280. Flows are perennial in the upper watershed but ephemeral on the valley floor, with two exceptions: the portion of the Permanente Creek mainstem between Foothill Expressway and Interstate 280, and the Hale Creek tributary. The perennial reaches of these creeks share the same perennial nature as a similar reach on nearby Adobe Creek. Diversion channel Highway 85 The confluence of Hale Creek (right) and the reduced Permanente Creek (left) in Los Altos, viewed from Mountain View Except for sakrete (bagged concrete) banking and several weirs, Permanente Creek's upper mainstem runs about in a relatively unmodified natural channel until reaching Portland and Miramonte Avenues at the north end of Heritage Oaks Park. Here the creek enters a concrete trapezoidal channel constructed by the Santa Clara Valley Water District (SCVWD). Just before reaching the rear of Blach Intermediate School, it becomes the Permanent Creek Diversion Channel, built by the SCVWD in 1959, and runs a total of , continuing due east until passing in a culvert beneath east under Highway 85 to Stevens Creek. A floodgate is closed every winter that diverts virtually all winter flows east to Stevens Creek, preventing high winter floodwaters from flowing north in the original creek channel through dense residential areas. Only during high floods can a portion of the creek's waters surmount the floodgate and return to the original channel. Therefore, the Diversion Channel effectively reconnects Permanente Creek to the Stevens Creek watershed. This recapitulates the 1862 Allardt Map of the San Francisco & San Jose Railroad which shows Permanente Creek (Arroyo Permanente) as a tributary of Stevens Creek (then Cupertino Creek) (see inset). This is significant ecologically, because Stevens Creek still hosts an anadromous steelhead trout run. Although steep drops in the Diversion Channel are impassable barriers to upstream fish migration, modifications to the Diversion Channel would allow trout to run to the upper Permanente Creek watershed. The Diversion Channel essentially changes the total length of Permanente Creek from to San Francisco Bay to ending at its junction with Stevens Creek just past Highway 85. However, Hale Creek still flows to the channelized lower reaches of Permanente Creek. Lower mainstem Most of the creek's route through Mountain View is channelized as here by Crittenden Middle School. The original creek channel below the floodgate in the Diversion Channel, now severely depleted of water, runs north another to its confluence with Hale Creek just upstream from McKelvey Park. Permanente Creek's original channel then goes on to pass under U. S. Highway 101, along the west side of the Google campus, and out to the Bay at the Mountain View Slough just east of Shoreline Park, the latter built on a reclaimed San Francisco garbage dump in 1983. This lowest part of the creek historically disappeared into the marshland before reaching the Bay, and its channel was extended to the Bay in the nineteenth century. The creek must have been hydrologically connected to the Bay at times of high winter flows since steelhead trout were able to access Permanente Creek historically. Saltwater is pumped from Charleston Slough into Shoreline Lake and from there it flows to Permanente Creek and then back into the Bay. The Mountain View Slough carries flows to the Bay between former salt ponds A1 and A2W. The levees around these ponds will be breached and opened to the Bay as part of the South Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project Phase II. The Santa Clara Valley Water District plans to excavate as much as down to create flood detention basins to protect homes from a 100-year Permanente Creek flood at Cuesta Park Annex, Blach Intermediate School, McKelvey Park and Rancho San Antonio County Park. Despite considerable community opposition, the SCVWD Board approved the decision to go ahead on June 17, 2010. The Blach School Board voted against use of school property for a detention basin but construction permits are being sought as of 2016 for the McKelvey Park and Rancho San Antonio Park basins. Construction of the McKelvey Park detention basin and recreational facilities was completed in February 2020. Construction at Rancho San Antonio Park is planned to include a 15-foot deep basin and new park infrastructure. Ecology Looking west, from east side of Stevens Creek, at terminus of Permanente Creek Diversion Channel as it exits beneath Highway 85. Here Permanente Creek drops about ten vertical feet over cemented boulders, an impassable barrier to in-migrating steelhead trout, 2013. Egrets are a common sight in the creek near the bay. There is an egret rookery in the trees on Shorebird Way a few blocks away. Federally threatened California red-legged frogs (Rana draytonii)) inhabit the upper watershed of Permanente Creek and the US Fish and Wildlife Service in 2017 asked the Army Corps of Engineers to assure that sufficient riparian habitat, specifically near ponds 14 and 21 along the Permanente Quarrry, would be set in a conservation easement to ensure their survival. In fact, a 2011 biological resources assessment of the quarry property found six California special status wildlife species, including the California red-legged frog, dusky- footed woodrat {Neotoma fuscipes), white-tailed kite (Elanus leucurus), olive- sided flycatcher (Contopus cooperi)), yellow warbler (Setophaga petechia), and grasshopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum). Although Leidy postulated that steelhead trout (coastal rainbow trout) (Oncorhynchus mykiss irideus) were once native to Permanente Creek but now extirpated, twenty stream resident rainbow trout from the stream were sampled in a genetic study by the SCVWD and published in 2008. In 1940, a California Department of Fish and Game stream survey noted a resident‚Äôs account of Permanente Creek as formerly a ‚Äúfine trout stream\\" from which anglers caught large fish. Since most of the creek's flow is diverted to the Permanente Creek Diversion which culminates in a drop, steelhead can no longer ascend the stream. However, rainbow trout (the landlocked form of steelhead trout) can successfully reproduce in freshwater and continue to do so. The genetics study indicates that their genetics have historical integrity, i.e. they are not hatchery stock. A study of trout in South Bay streams found the Permanente Creek trout to be the most genetically introgressed of any watershed in the region, potentially descended from a single, surviving family of trout. Downstream fish passage barrier removal will be key to restoring the genetic diversity, and thus likelihood of survival, of these trout. Also of relevance, the cement company operating in the upper part of the watershed has discharged sediment-laden water into Permanente Creek and has undertaken corrective actions. As recommended by Becker in 2007 and Higgins in 2012, modification of the Permanente Creek Diversion Channel would enable steelhead trout to return to the protected upper reaches of Permanente Creek beginning above Heritage Oaks Park and including Rancho San Antonio County Park and Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve. The amount of stream length available to spawning steelhead trout above the Diversion Channel would be increased significantly by more than ( of Permanente Creek mainstem plus of West Fork Permanente Creek (to the small reservoir) plus additional miles of Wildcat Canyon Creek and other small tributaries).U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high- resolution flowline data.The National Map, accessed June 8, 2013 Leidy's 2007 report also recorded the fish still inhabiting Permanente Creek - including native California roach (Lavinia symmetricus), Sacramento sucker (Catostomus occidentalis occidentalis), threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), and non-native bluegill (Lepomis macrochirus), common carp (Cyprinus carpio), rainwater killifish (Lucania parva), and western mosquitofish (Gambusia affinis). Riparian trees on Permanente Creek include the State's tallest and third largest California bay laurel tree (Umbellularia californica) - see Gallery below, estimated to be over 200 years old. Other riparian trees include Willow ssp. (Salix ssp.), California sycamore (Platanus racemosa), white alder (Alnus rhombifolia), black cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), Fremont cottonwood (Populus fremontii), bigleaf maple (Acer macrophyllum), California buckeye (Aesculus californica) and California walnut (Juglans californica). Shoreline Park meadows near the mouth of Permanente Creek provide critical remnant habitat for the western burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia), a bird that has vanished from many counties in the Bay Area. The owl was listed as a Species of Special Concern (a pre-listing category under the Endangered Species Act) by the California Department of Fish and Game in 1979, and its Bay Area population continues to decline. Although there were hundreds of burrowing owls in Santa Clara County when monitoring began in the 1980s, now there are only 35, with three breeding pairs raising ten eggs at Shoreline in 2011 (less than half the number of young in 2003). In August, 2003 the Stevens & Permanente Creeks Watershed Council was officially formed to support stewardship of the watersheds. Pollution Mercury The cement plant at the Permanente (Lehigh Hanson) Quarry is responsible for 29% of total Bay Area airborne mercury emissions and was shown to impact a rural site, Calero Reservoir, away. Mercury, a neurotoxin and pollutant which is concentrated in the aquatic food web, was found to be 5.8 to 6.7 times higher in precipitation near the cement plant than at a control location away. A 2011 study showed a significant geographic association between the occurrence of autism in local school districts, such as the Cupertino Union School District, and higher levels of ambient mercury generated by coal-fired power plants in Bexar County, Texas and the Permanente Quarry cement plant in Santa Clara County, California. Selenium discharges Groundwater fills the current quarry and is pumped into Permanente Creek. Selenium pollution in the creek downstream from the quarry ranged from 13 to 81 micrograms/liter (Œºg/L). A North Quarry water sample in January 2010 had a dissolved selenium concentration of 82 Œºg/L, indicating that the quarry is the source of the selenium pollution. Selenium is bioaccumulated in the aquatic food web. Safety standards for selenium concentrations in fresh water are 5 Œºg/L under the California Toxics Rule (same as the National Toxics Rule set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) in 2000 and 2012. Sediment discharges Anthropomorphic activities related to quarry operations and the cement plant have resulted in sediment discharges into Permanente Creek that are 3.5 times what would be expected under normal conditions. Sediment loads in the upper Permanente Creek mainstem are 15 times those in the West Fork Permanente Creek, which drains mostly parkland. These sediment loads could threaten the resident rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) population in the creek. Recreation The Permanente Creek Trail underpass at Old Middlefield Way Above Interstate 280 (and below the Quarry) a large section of the creek mainstem and all of the West Fork Permanente Creek tributary, and the Ohlone Creek sub-tributary, is protected by Rancho San Antonio County Park and Rancho San Antonio Open Space Preserve. The Open Space Preserve, combined with the adjoining County Park, in area and contains of hiking trails. A one-mile walk from the County Park's main parking lot leads to the historic 10-acre Deer Valley Farm on the West Fork Permanente Creek. There is a trail that runs along the creek, beginning at the historic Rengstorff House in Shoreline Park where it is connected to the San Francisco Bay Trail. The Permanente Creek Trail runs from there south to West Middlefield Road.

It was launched on 9 November 2009 and published its findings on 12 October 2010. It was chaired by Lord Browne of Madingley, the former chief executive of BP. It recommended wide-ranging changes to the system of university funding, including removing the cap on the level of fees that universities can charge, and increasing the income level at which graduates must begin to pay back their loans to ¬£21,000.Review research spending Scope According to Lord Mandelson the review would consider \\"balance of contributions to universities by taxpayers, students, graduates and employers\\" to University finances. The review would consider how much students should be charged for attending University. The panel was told to take into account the goal of widening participation. The panel would report its findings after the 2010 General Election. The review had been promised in 2004 to try to win over Labour rebels who nearly rejected the Bill which introduced ¬£3,000 a year fees. The review would consider other issues including simplifying the system of student finance and bursary arrangements. The Browne Review made its first call for evidence in December 2009. Times Higher Education reported that the review's themes were \\"participation rates, the quality of the higher education system and affordability for students and the state\\". Background Research The Browne Review spent ¬£68,000 on research, from a research budget of ¬£120,000. The majority of the expenditure funded one unpublished opinion survey of students and parents. Now that's research impact: 'paradigm-shifting' Browne drew on a single opinion survey The survey focussed on how much participants would be willing to pay if fees were restructured. It asked 80 school pupils, 40 parents, 40 early-year University students, and 18 part-time students from various backgrounds for their opinion on University funding. Participants of the survey were posed questions on an upper-limit on fees of ¬£6,000 per-annum. Interim findings In March 2010 the review published its initial findings stating that it had found \\"clear agreement\\" that the current level of fees had not deterred students but that the system of finance for part-time students was inadequate. The panel also found: *clear evidence that bursaries are not understood by students early enough to have a substantial impact on their choices *consensus that potential students need better information, advice and guidance, including information on the teaching experience they can expect on different courses *some concerns that a minority of students are deterred by top-up fees *that there has been progress over the past five years in widening participation to higher education, but that this has been less marked at the most selective universities Political positions The Browne Review was set up by Labour in 2009, but did not report until after the 2010 General Election. No party won the election outright, and after negotiations the Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties formed a coalition government. The Coalition Agreement gave the Liberal Democrats, who had campaigned against fee increases, the right to abstain from any vote to increase tuition fees. In this case, the effective majority of the Conservatives would fall to 24, meaning that the government could potentially be defeated by a rebellion of 12 of its own MPs. Labour David Miliband was the only candidate in the Labour leadership election to reject a graduate tax Lord Mandelson, the former Business Secretary who set up the review into higher education funding, hinted in July 2009 at a tuition fee rise stating that excellence in higher education was \\"not cheap\\" and that the country \\"had to face up to the challenge of paying for excellence\\". The Labour Party manifesto for the 2010 General Election promised extra University places but made no commitment on how much students would have to pay. During the Labour Party leadership election in 2010 following the resignation of Gordon Brown both Ed Balls and the eventual winner Ed Miliband came out in support of a graduate tax as a method of funding universities in the future. David Miliband was the only candidate in the leadership election not to support a graduate tax. Conservatives and Liberal Democrats The Conservatives have said that they will \\"consider carefully\\" the outcome of the review. In June 2010 David Willets stated that under the current arrangements students were a \\"burden on the taxpayer that had to be tackled\\" although he also stated he did not want to pre-empt the findings of Lord Browne. The Liberal Democrats have traditionally supported free higher education but downgraded this pledge because it was seen to be an unaffordable spending commitment. The Liberal Democrats had promised to abolish tuition fees over 6 years. All the elected Liberal Democrat MPs, as well as a number of others, also signed the NUS Vote for Students pledge, promising to vote against any proposed increase in fees. Coalition Government The Liberal Democrats agreed to abstain on a vote to increase fees as part of a Liberal-Conservative coalition government which emerged after the 2010 General Election. This would allow the Conservatives to pass an increase in tuition fees or even the removal of the cap on fees without the Liberal Democrats voting them down. The chief executive of Universities UK, Nicola Dandridge, has stated that senior Liberal Democrats have told them that they consider their election manifesto pledge to be \\"complete nonsense\\" and that the \\"visceral\\" opposition to fees from the party base was not shared by senior figures. Former Liberal Democrat leader Ming Campbell has said that he is \\"likely\\" to honour the pledge he made to his constituents and rebel against his party by voting against a rise in fees and newly elected Liberal Democrat Deputy Leader Simon Hughes has stated that the issue of fees could split the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government while reiterating the opposition of the Liberal Democrats to tuition fees. The MP for the student- populated Leeds North West, Greg Mulholland, is considered to be the leader of a backbench rebellion against the review that is indicated to have the support of at least thirty Liberal Democrats. In July 2010 it was reported that a graduate tax was seriously being considered by Vince Cable although a senior Conservative anonymously briefed against Mr Cable stating it was \\"unlikely\\" that a graduate tax would be adopted. Liberal Democrat leader and Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has also backed a graduate tax. Submissions and lobbying The Russell Group's submission to the review stated that graduates should pay real rates of interest on their student loans to prevent a university funding crisis. The 1994 Group have stated that there should be an increase in the cap to generate competition between universities. Wendy Piatt, head of the Russell Group, has stated that current levels of funding are not adequate if Universities are to remain globally competitive. The 1994 Group have called for the review to ensure that cost does not prevent people from attending University and for a focus on the student experience. Million+ have stated that students should not be asked to pay more for cuts in public funding and Unions 94 have called for more progressive alternatives to variable tuition fees. The University and Colleges Union have stated that lifting the cap on tuition fees would be 'the most regressive piece of education policy since the war' and suggest replacing fees with a Business Education Tax. In their second submission to the Browne Review the Russell Group stated that lifting the cap on tuition fees was the only \\"viable and fair\\" way of financing higher education and that the \\"liberalisation of the fee regime\\" was a future aim. The Institute for Fiscal Studies concludes in its submission that: \\"Increasing fees without increasing loans and/or grants by the same value or more will result in a negative impact on participation\\". The British Medical Association has warned that increasing tuition fees could land medical students with debts in excess of ‚Ç§90,000, as medical degrees are longer and give students less time to partake in part-time work. Findings The Browne Review published its findings on 12 October 2010. The recommendations include: * Removing the current ¬£3,290 per year cap on the tuition fees that universities can charge to students. There would be no cap on the fees that an institution could charge. * The government would provide upfront loans to cover tuition fees and living costs of students. Means tested grants would be available for students from lower income families. * Students would repay the loans after graduation, and only when they are earning more than ¬£21,000. Repayments would be made at a rate of 9% on any income above ¬£21,000. Any debt not repaid after 30 years would be written off. For comparison, the system at the time demanded repayments of 9% on income above ¬£15,000, and debt was written off after 25 years. *Part-time students would no longer have to pay upfront tuition fees, and would instead be eligible for loans. The review rejects the option of a graduate tax, because there would be a large funding gap in the short term. It estimates that if all new students from 2012 paid 3% graduate tax after graduation, the tax would not provide sufficient revenue to fund higher education until 2041‚Äì42. This would weaken the independence of universities, which would become entirely dependent on the government for funding. It argues that its own proposals would force universities to improve standards to compete for students: their relationship with students would become more important to universities than their relationship with government. Subsequent government proposals On 3 November 2010, David Willetts announced new government proposals following the review. The proposals incorporate many features of Lord Browne's recommendations: loans would be offered to all students to cover fees, to be repaid only when graduates are earning over ¬£21,000, at a rate of 9%, written off after 30 years; part-time students would be entitled to loans on a similar basis to full-time students; there would be a real interest rate with a progressive taper. But in a break with the review's proposals, the government proposed an absolute cap on fees of ¬£9,000 per year. Universities charging fees of over ¬£6,000 per year would be required to contribute to a National Scholarships program. There would be a tougher regime of sanctions encouraging these universities to widen access. There will be further consultation on early repayment systems, to avoid richer graduates gaining an unfair advantage by 'buying themselves out' of the system. The government intends to implement the changes in time for the 2012/13 academic year. Vote on maximum tuition fees The Parliamentary vote on increasing the maximum tuition fees was held on 9 December 2010, following a week of protests. The Labour Party opposed the fee increase and Conservatives mostly agreed. Liberal Democrats MPs voted both ways, with 28 voting for, 21 against and 8 not voting. Liberal Democrat ministers voted for the change; Jenny Willott and Mike Crockart resigned as PPS to vote against the increase. Deputy leader of the Liberal Democrats Simon Hughes abstained. The Conservative ‚Äì Liberal Democrat coalition agreement states that \\"If the response of the Government to Lord Browne‚Äôs report is one that Liberal Democrats cannot accept, then arrangements will be made to enable Liberal Democrat MPs to abstain in any vote\\". and Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg considered a mass abstention of the Liberal Democrat party on the issue in order to prevent a three-way split within the party. The minister responsible for the proposals was Business Secretary and Liberal Democrat Vince Cable. Cable gave a number of contradictory accounts of whether he would vote in favour or abstain from voting. Criticisms Stephen Williams criticised the lack of Parliamentary scrutiny of the review panel Criticisms before the release of the review findings The Browne Review has been the subject of several criticisms related to its perceived lack of independence, lack of Parliamentary scrutiny and lack of representativeness. =Independence= The independence of the review has been questioned. Lord Browne has been described by The Telegraph as \\"one of New Labour's favourite businessmen\\". Two Vice-Chancellors and a civil servant who advised the government on the introduction of the current fee regime also form part of the team conducting the review. After the 2010 General Election Lord Browne accepted a role as the Government's Lead Non-Executive Director' to advise on the appointment of business leaders to reformed departmental boards. =Representativeness= There is no student representation on the Browne Review: the youngest member of the review panel Rajay Naik rejected the suggestion that he is a representative of student interests, stating \\"I don't feel at all as if I represent only the student constituency, just as the other members aren't looking out for special interests\\". In November 2009 Liberal Democrat Universities Spokesperson Stephen Williams stated: \\"The lack of student representatives is particularly concerning as it is these people who will really suffer if fees are raised. It is disgraceful that there hasn't been an opportunity to scrutinise the make-up of the review‚Äôs panel or its remit in Parliament\\". Sally Hunt of the University and College Union criticised the lack of employee representation on the panel, suggesting that, by contrast, business and employer interests had a lot of representation. =Timing= The Liberal Democrats criticised the fact that the panel would not report its findings until after the General Election. BBC education journalist Mike Baker suggested that the Browne Review which had been expected to report in the summer would be delayed until the Autumn so as to avoid opponents causing trouble over fees during the party conference season. =Other criticisms= The National Union of Students warned the review could create a market based system of higher education. In 2009, then NUS President Wes Streeting stated: \\"There is a real danger that this review will pave the way for higher fees and a market in prices that would see poorer students priced out of more prestigious universities and other students and universities consigned to the 'bargain basement'\\". In July 2010 Labour MP Pat McFadden criticised anonymous briefings from the Conservative Party against the possibility of a graduate tax, a policy which had been mooted by Liberal Democrat Vince Cable. He stated: \\"It is completely shambolic for the Lib Dem secretary of state to make a speech advocating one policy one week then for a Tory briefing to point in a different direction a week late....Discussion of higher education finance within the coalition is now being governed more by managing the internal politics of the government than the interests of students, universities or the wider taxpayer.\\" Oxford University Student Union criticised the fact that the Russell Group's submission the Browne review was confidential with a freedom of information request being rejected. The UK Youth Parliament, an affiliate of the British Youth Council also responded to the Browne Review. Their criticism centred around both the way in which the review was conducted and the conclusion it reached. The UK Youth Parliament believed that lifting the cap on University tuition fees would force young people to make \\"financially driven choices when it comes to choosing where and what to study\\". Former Member of UK Youth Parliament and UKYP National Spokesperson Harrison Carter commented on behalf of the organisation saying: \\"Fees themselves are unfair and act as a barrier to education, widening the rich-poor divide which exists in this country. I and many other members of the UK Youth Parliament seriously condemn this action. The news that fees are set to go up, and that the graduate tax is to be dropped is truly worrying for young people. \\"We are deeply concerned that young people under the age of 18, those whom increased fees will actually hit, haven‚Äôt been adequately consulted about the proposed changes to university funding. \\"Young people up and down the country, starting secondary school, studying for their GCSEs, or thinking about A-levels ‚Äì those are the ones who will be making life changing choices, based on this review and decisions made behind closed doors. It is essential that the Government demonstrates they are in tune with young people‚Äôs views, by widely consulting under 18-year-olds and establishing the impact upon this group, before any legislative change to university funding is introduced\\"http://harrymyp.files.wordpress.com/2011/03/response-to-the-review- of-higher-education-and-student-finance-in-england-october-2010.pdf The Government made the decision to increase University tuition fees to a maximum of ¬£9,000 with a view that higher education institutions should invest some of the extra income from fees above ¬£6,000 in promoting fair access.http://www.bis.gov.uk/assets/biscore/higher- education/docs/g/11-1046-government-response-to-browne-review Criticisms of subsequent government proposals Analysis by the Chartered Institute for Taxation found most graduates will pay off their debt for the rest of their lives if they repay at the lowest possible rate due to the way the debt will increase by RPI inflation plus 3% over the years that the graduates repay it. Someone starting on ¬£21,000 and seeing their salary increase by 5% a year would end up paying ¬£64,239 over 30 years, with an unpaid debt of ¬£26,406 at the end of their working lives. This also suggests that the national debt may increase rather than fall as a result of the new system. In 2014 Nick Hillman of the Higher Education Policy Institute stated that the government had \\"got its maths wrong\\" by overestimating the amount of money students would repay with a ¬£21,000 threshold. The Guardian have revealed that based on 2014 estimates 45% of student loan debt will never be repaid. If this figure reaches the threshold of 48% then more money would have been collected under the \\"old\\" system of ¬£3,000 fees with a lower repayment threshold.

It is also sometimes called Bothmaskloof. This pass takes travelers over the mountain of Kasteelberg, and down to the lush Riebeek Valley, where the old town of Riebeek Kasteel is situated. In this valley, there are vineyards, wheat fields, and olive groves. The vineyards produce some excellent quality wines. As a result, wine tours are popular here, and the wines are often paired with the locally grown olives. There is a very deep cut through the top of the pass, which was created to ensure that the steep gradient is still safe for travelers to use. The cut is some 18 meters deep and the road is tarred. There is a memorial situated just past Bothmanskloof's summit, which is dedicated to Pieter Cruythoff. He and his travelling companion, Pieter Meerhoff, discovered Kasteelberg and the Riebeek Valley on their trek to a mythical place. They named it after Jan van Riebeeck, who was one of the founders of Cape Town in 1652 and the administrator of the Dutch East India Company. These explorers claimed to have spotted quagga, black wildebeest, and rhinoceros in this verdant valley. Nearby to Bothmaskloof are the towns of Riebeek-Kasteel and Riebeek West.

At that time, it consisted of the usual German infantry division elements: three infantry regiments of three battalions each, one three-battalion regiment of light artillery, one battalion of heavy artillery, a panzerjager (anti-tank) battalion, an aufkl√§rungs (reconnaissance) battalion, a signals battalion, a pioneer (engineer) battalion, and divisional supply, medical, and administrative units. Just prior to the invasion of Poland, the division was positioned on the left wing of Army Group South under the X Army Corps. It was to attack in the general direction of the area in front of ≈Å√≥d≈∫. It fought battles in areas of Kalisch, during the Vistula crossing at Warta, also at Kol. Balin, Niewiesz and Uniejew. During the Battle of Bzura they suffered heavy losses, including 1500 POWs captured by the Poles. They had to reject violent counterattacks and attempts to escape by the trapped Polish troops. Their commander Major General von Briesen personally led his last held in reserve battalion into battle and was seriously wounded and lost his right forearm.

The Organization was founded as a result of growing demand from people who wanted to know their HIV status. At this time the HIV/AIDS in Uganda was high. AIC currently offers HIV counselling and testing services through 8 branches of Kampala, Jinja, Mbale, Mbarara, Arua, Lira, Soroti and Kabale, selected hospitals, health centres, and antenatal clinics. AIC also conducts HCT outreaches to communities and institutions targeting the Most-at risk populations. AIC supported the Uganda Ministry of Health to extend HCT services nearer to the communities by supporting HCT in 33 districts in Uganda with over 200 district health facilities benefiting. By December 2010 AIC had served over 2,959,193 clients. The number keeps growing and for the last 3 years over 300,000 clients annually are being served using the different approaches for HCT. To consolidate its HIV counselling and Testing services in the country, AIC has adopted a new vision as ‚ÄòUniversal knowledge of HIV status in Uganda‚Äô and its mission as ‚Äòto provide HIV and AIDS information and quality HCT services‚Äô and this will be through to 2015. How AIC works AIC is now a membership organisation, with a functional Board of Trustees (BOT), 8 Branch Advisory Committees (BACs) and just over 3000 members all over Uganda. Headed by the Executive Director, AIC now employs 140 full- time staff that include Managers, coordinators, supervisors, medical and no medical counselors and medical officers and support staff. AIC has a wide range of stakeholders with whom it works including government ministries, development partners and other agencies involved in HIV and AIDS work. Major stakeholders include Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), United States Agency for International Development (USAID), Department for International Development (DFID), European Union (EU), Ministry of Health (MoH), Uganda AIDS Commission (UAC), the AIDS Support Organization (TASO), District Local Governments among others. Services offered by AIC HIV counselling and Testing Services  AIC uses a multi-faceted approach in order to increase accessibility and HCT utilisation. Client initiated HCT is provided at the 8 AIC stand alone branches and outreaches. Targeted outreaches for the Most At Risk Populations (MARPs) are also conducted for these hard to reach populations that included commercial sex workers, Long Distance Truck Drivers and their clients, Fishing communities and Institutions of Higher learning. Commercial sex workers access HCT services during the peak hours of service delivery in order to benefit their clients. The truck drivers with their \\"service providers\\" are also another target group that AIC serves during evenings and nights at their transit stations. This HCT service delivery strategy is now referred to as the \\"Moonlight HCT services\\". For distant areas with difficult terrain, the community camping strategy is used. This is where HCT service providers camp in a community and provide services from the community for several days. This strategy is cost effective in terms of fuel, wear and tear and ensured service delivery to all potential clients. This strategy also promotes community involvement as mobilisation is done through the existing community structures. HCT is also offered to pregnant women both at the branches and at the supported health units where HCT is offered to all pregnant women as part of their routine ante-natal medical check up. HIV Counseling and Testing (HCT) service are offered daily (even on Sundays and public holidays on appointments) at an affordable user fee in AIC main branches. Free HCT is also provided to children and youth below 24 years of age and Most At Risk Population. AIC is currently the largest single Non- governmental Organisation (NGO) HCT service provider in the country contributing at least 26 -30% of the total number of individuals tested for HIV in the country in any a given year. Palliative care AIC contributes to the goal of the National Strategic Plan in care and treatment by offering Palliative Care Basic ‚ÄìHealth Care (PCBHC). PCBHC includes psychosocial support, screening for and treatment of opportunistic infections (including Tuberculosis), as well as the provision of the basic health care package. The basic health care package includes prevention of malaria, respiratory and central nervous system diseases among PLHAs. Psychosocial Support Clients that are HIV positive are encouraged to live positively. This is provided by counselors to clients during one on one session or in Post Test clubs. TB/HIV Integration AIC is guided by the National Policy guidelines for TB/HIV collaborative activities in Uganda. The overall goal of the policy is to decrease the burden of tuberculosis and HIV in Uganda through improved TB and HIV collaborative interventions. AIC employs a screening tool developed in collaboration with Centres for Disease Control and prevention (CDC) to screen HIV positive clients for TB This is done in the 8 branches of AIC and the supported sites Screening and treatment of other opportunistic Infections AIC screens and treats sexually transmitted infections like syphilis and Herpes simplex type II and other opportunistic infections like skin infections, pneumonias and others in all its eight branches. Among the integrated services offered are education and counseling on Reproductive health issues for the HIV positive and offering of Family Planning (FP) suitable to individual circumstances and choice. Basic Care Packages (BCP) HIV positive clients receives basic care packages consisting of mosquito nets, water guard chemical and a safe water vessel, condoms, Septrin for prophylaxis and reading material on psychosocial counseling to all HIV positive clients. This Package helps in prevention of malaria, respiratory, central nervous system diseases among PLHAs. This was achieved through partnership with PSI. Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis A daily dose of Cotrimoxazole has been proven to prolong life (25-50% decrease in mortality) and reduce the incidence of malaria, diarrhoea, toxoplasmosis, certain respiratory infections, blood infections (Septicaemia) and other illnesses affecting PLHA. CD4 Monitoring AIC started offering this service in 2004 at AIC Kampala but has now expanded to cover all the 8 branches. The service is offered to the all HIV positive clients after VCT and are able to pay the user fee for the CD4/CD8+ count, any client with evidence of a positive HIV test and referral document from a recognized centre and clients already on ARVS with referral for monitoring. Research and Documentation AIC being the pioneer HCT organization in Uganda, and with over 20 years of work, AIC is well placed to play a leading role in driving or influencing policy and practice in the area of HCT. AIC has made deliberate efforts to promote its corporate image among its clients, development partners and central government agencies. AIC conducts operational research to generate answers to emerging questions and provide evidence-based data on HCT. Through its research and documentation activities with its partners, AIC has supported to the public to access evidence-based information on HCT and its related services through various channels, including the print materials, radio, video, the resource centre and website. Capacity Building for HIV Counselling and Testing AIC trains HIV/AIDS Counselors, Trainer of Trainers, Counselor supervisors, Laboratory technicians, Data entrants, Voluntary counseling and testing promoters, and People living with HIV/AIDS who have accepted to go public. AIC provides training within and outside Uganda in HCT; HIV prevention, care, adherence, and support. Youth Friendly Services AIC provides specially designed HCT to meet the special needs of young people, aged 12 to 24 free of charge with same day results. This followed a study conducted to identify opportunities and barriers for providing VCT to youth. With trained peer counselors, a private waiting room and lab, the environment is youth friendly, satisfying the need for privacy. Youth can also access all other AIC services including referral to youth friendly service organizations. AIC also provides HCT for children below age 12. To date AIC has established seven youth corners at seven AIC branches. HIV Prevention Programme AIC has continued to contribute towards the national efforts to fight the drivers of the epidemic. Appropriate messages are delivered depending on the nature of the client and community. Abstinence, Be faithful and condom use Abstinence messages encourage young clients to abstain or delay their sex debut. The messages delivered give the client the advantages of abstaining, and give role models in society who abstained and have been successful in their lives. AIC delivers abstinence messages to young people in and out of school through educational talks, music and drama outreaches and HIV counseling sessions at HCT service delivery sites. Recent studies indicate an escalating HIV prevalence among people who are currently married or cohabiting and those that have ever been married. Statistics from the AIC database corroborate these findings. AIC uses community dialogues, music and drama and HIV counseling in the provision of \\"Be faithful\\" messages to the target audience who are sexually active clients. The need for promotion of correct and consistent use of condoms remains vital because majority of high risk populations (MARPS) do not know the correct use of the condoms while those that know, do not use them consistently. Condoms are distributed through PTC condom distribution outlets, AIC branch offices and other targeted points such as bars and lodges. Know Your HIV Status Clubs The Uganda Demographic and Health Survey (UDHS), 2006 indicated that although most people had some knowledge about HIV only about 30 percent of women and 40 percent of men had comprehensive knowledge. In order to bridge this gap and increase comprehensive knowledge about HIV and to increase access to care and support for clients who have tested HIV positive, AIC established the Know Your HIV Status Clubs at parish level in 9 districts of Uganda in 2010. A Know Your HIV Status Club (KYHSC) is an association of 20 members at parish level who have been selected by the community to pass on messages to households on HIV and AIDS prevention and care. These members are drawn from the existing district structures such as Village Health Teams, Community Resource Persons, PHA Network Support Agents, Post Test Club members and other structures. The major role of the twenty members is to disseminate information on comprehensive HIV and AIDS prevention package at household level. Post Test Services The AIC Post Test Club (PTC) was established on August 4, 1990, in support of the national effort to prevent further spread of HIV and AIDS and to provide psychosocial support to those infected and affected by HIV. The purpose of the club is to respond to the expressed needs of the clients for ongoing support services. The major objective is to offer on-going psychosocial support to the members irrespective of their HIV status. All the eight AIC regional centres have PTC's and over 20 district based PTCs in Uganda are supported . The services range from on-going support counseling, educational talks, condom promotion, community mobilization to distribution of Information Education Communication (IEC) materials among others. AIC Couple Club In the recent past, AIC realized that the cases of HIV discordance among couples were on the rise. HIV test results showed that at least 8% of all couples tested have one HIV positive while the other is negative. The Couple Club support couples socially and psychologically, enabling them cope with denial, avoid blame, or violence. At the Discordant Couple Club, AIC provide: Ongoing psychosocial support; continuous education to prevent the infection of the HIV negative partner; peer psychosocial support groups through sharing experiences; promote positive living and provide education on treatment options. We also impart income generation skills for many of the clients. Philly Lutaaya Initiative (PLI) The PLI was established in September 1991 through the collaborative efforts of TASO, World Learning Inc., AIC and UNICEF. PLI was formed after the death of the renowned Ugandan musician Philly Lutaaya Bongole the first Ugandan to publicly declare that he was infected with HIV. The objective of the PLI was to bring the reality of HIV and AIDS to the general affected communities and to demonstrate that people living with HIV and AIDS (PHAs) can lead a healthy and productive life.

He is a global expert on implementation of large-scale system change, a leading authority on education systems and education reform, and was knighted in 2005 for his contributions to improving government. Barber has worked for over 20 years in education and government reform and improvement. During that time, he has advised governments in over 60 countries on issues of public policy and delivery. He was the founder and first head of the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit under Prime Minister Tony Blair, and later served as Chief Education Advisor at Pearson, and as a partner at McKinsey, where he was head of the global education practice. He currently serves as Co- Chair of Boston Consulting Group's not-for-profit foundation, Centre for Public Impact;; he has been a Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Harvard T.H.

As a member of the Labour Party, he was elected to the council of the London Borough of Hackney, becoming chair of the education committee. In 1987 he contested for Labour the seat of Henley-on-Thames, then held by Michael Heseltine. Government Barber served as Chief Adviser to the Secretary of State for Education on School Standards during the first term of British Prime Minister Tony Blair, from 1997 to 2001. During Blair's second term, from 2001 to 2005, Barber served as the Chief Adviser on Delivery, reporting directly to Prime Minister Tony Blair. As head of the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit (PMDU), he was responsible for working with government agencies to ensure successful implementation of the Prime Minister's priority programs, including those in health, education, transport, policing, the criminal justice system, and asylum/immigration. He wrote a book about his experience in the PMDU. Instruction to Deliver: Fighting to Reform Britain‚Äôs Public Services (Methuen 2008), It was described by the Financial Times as \\"one of the best books about British Government for many years\\". Barber is currently the Government's preferred candidate to chair the soon-to- be-established Office for Students. Delivery Associates Barber is the Founder and Chairman of Delivery Associates, the leading public sector advisory group focused on implementation of large-scale reform and establishment of delivery units. It applies the Science of Delivery across all 6 continents to achieve step-change in citizen outcomes across education, health, economic development, infrastructure and other areas of government. At McKinsey and Company Following his time leading the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit, Barber served as partner and head of McKinsey's Global Education Practice. While at McKinsey, Barber co-authored two major education reports: How the world‚Äôs most improved school systems keep getting better (2010) and How the world‚Äôs best-performing schools come out on top (2007). During this time, Barber continued to work on management in the public sector, and published Deliverology 101 in 2011 to serve as a comprehensive guide to system reform and delivery. Governments and large public organisations (from the Louisiana school system to the Malaysian government) adopted elements of the 'deliverology' approach. Additionally, a number of international organizations including the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the World Bank, DFID, and the IMF sought his advice and guidance. Barber also served as co-chair of the Pakistan Education Taskforce, as DFID Special Representative on Education for Pakistan. He has now made more than fifty visits to Pakistan, where he continues to serve as an advisor on system reform to the Chief Minister of Punjab, Shahbaz Sharif. This work led to the development of the 'Punjab Roadmap, with ambitious goals to increase the quality of education offered at all 60,000 schools in the Punjab. The Good News from Pakistan, published in 2013 with Reform, summarises the change achieved between August 2011 and January 2013. These include: * One and a half million extra children enrolled in school * Simple, easy-to-use lesson plans for every teacher and new textbooks for every student * Student attendance increased from 83 per cent to 92 per cent. * Teacher attendance increased from 81 per cent to 91 per cent. * Facilities with functioning electricity, drinking water, toilet and boundary walls increased from 69 per cent to 91 per cent. The Independent Commission on Aid Impact has praised the Roadmap as \\"an excellent example of how a well-designed monitoring system can be integral to the design of a reform programme\\". Education Delivery Institute In the summer of 2010, Barber teamed with leaders from the Education Trust and Achieve to found the U.S. Education Delivery Institute. Between 2010 and 2016, this Institute worked with leaders of K-12 and higher education systems around the United States to adapt the delivery concept pioneered by Barber in the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit to drive American education reform efforts.

Efficacy Barber was responsible for Pearson's detailed research and experimentation on what works in education, and how to demonstrate the effectiveness of different approaches, services and materials. This initiative was a major component of the company's global commitment to proven improvement in learning outcomes and applies across all investments and acquisitions. Pearson Affordable Learning Fund Barber chaired the Pearson Affordable Learning Fund. Announced in July 2012, The Pearson Affordable Learning Fund (PALF) is a venture fund with $65M of capital that invests in private schools, education technology, and scalable services to meet the demand for affordable education in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. PALF seeks investments with market returns while demonstrating outsized learning outcomes. In 2016, PALF had 10 portfolio companies across 6 countries, averaging 140% revenue growth in that year. The fund's first investment was in an affordable Ghanaian school chain, Omega Schools, headed by Ken Donkoh and Professor James Tooley. In the first four months of the investment, Omega Schools expanded from 10 schools serving 6,000 students to 20 schools serving 11,000. Oceans of Innovation In August 2012, Barber published Oceans of Innovation with Katelyn Donnelly and Saad Rizvi about the rise of Pacific Asia and the implications for global leadership and education. They laid out the need for whole system revolutions in education, which combine whole system reform and systemic innovation. The Learning Curve In November 2012, Barber launched The Learning Curve. The Learning Curve was commissioned by Pearson from the Economist Intelligence Unit to work with some of the world's leading education experts to review, research, and interview innovators from every continent about how best to achieve better learning outcomes. It established the first ever open and searchable global education data bank \\\\- drawing on the world's best existing data-sets including the PISA, TIMMS and PIRLS studies. It is one of the most comprehensive and accessible sets of data on learning that exists. An Avalanche is Coming In March 2013, Barber published An Avalanche is Coming with Katelyn Donnelly and Saad Rizvi about the upcoming revolution in global higher education. They described the 'unbundling' of higher education and called on university leaders to change The Incomplete Guide to Delivering Learning Outcomes This publication, co-authored with Saad Rizvi, introduces Pearson's journey towards putting efficacy at the heart of the company, and the lessons learned in the process that anyone passionate about delivering outcomes or transforming a company can apply. It describes the \\"Efficacy Framework,\\" a way to evaluate and improve impact on learning outcomes, and sets out the company's strategy, initiatives and insights in applying it. It also outlines how Pearson will ensure that the efficacy is applied throughout the company, reviewing all investments and acquisitions over a value of $1m, reporting publicly on Pearson's impact and making it a central pillar of every major decision. Asking More: The Path to Efficacy This publication, edited by Barber and Saad Rizvi, brings together articles from some of the world's leading education practitioners and business people to highlight the urgent opportunity for a global focus on outcomes in education. It explores how research and data collection can enable a revolutionary degree of rigour in measuring and improving the success of learning products and educational programmes. The authors consider priorities and barriers to learning outcomes and suggest possible solutions on the path to efficacy.

Beit Ya'akov, view toward Avishar Road. Beit Ya'akov (Hebrew: ◊ë◊ô◊™ ◊ô◊¢◊ß◊ë) is a small neighborhood in Jerusalem, founded in 1877, the ninth Jewish neighborhood outside the walls of the Old City. The neighborhood borders Jaffa Road and Avishar Road. The Mahane Yehuda Market is located there today. Historical background Beit Ya'akov was the last neighborhood in Jerusalem founded before the First Aliyah. This transition between the Old Yishuv and New Yishuv, and the awakening of Zionism, were not linked intentionally, but they stress the differences and similarities of these movements in the development of Israel and Jerusalem. In the 1860s and 1870s, the Old Yishuv expanded beyond the walls of the Old City, which was until then the traditional residential limit for Jerusalem residents. Other new neighborhoods were founded and Jerusalem grew. This building and expansion spawned new public and cultural institutions, intense activities which were driven by economic necessity, crowding and poverty in the traditional community. The development of these neighborhoods in the end of the 19th century was more like evolution, not like a new urban creation. A fine example may be found in the works of Joseph Rivlin. The 1870s saw the meeting between the Old Yishuv and the new immigrants of the First Aliyah. The lines of similarity between the two movements to settle Israel stand in the shadow of a conceptual distinction - the radical nationalist foundations of the new movement spawned a chasm between it and the Old, Orthodox religious, Yishuv. Founding of the neighborhood Beit Ya'akov was founded by a group of settlers under the leadership of Rabbi Moshe Graf, one of the appointees of the \\"Horodna Kollel\\" of the Ashkenazic community, and a member of the council of Mea She'arim. The neighborhood was called \\"Beit Ya'akov\\" because 70 houses that the founders planned for it, based on the Biblical verseGenesis 46:27 that 70 people came with Ya'akov (Jacob) to Egypt. Pinchas Grievsky explains in his book The Yishuv Outside the City Walls that the land of the neighborhood is 44,000 square cubits in area, and was purchased for a price of 500 Napoleonic gold. The construction was typical for the outer Jerusalem neighborhoods of that era. A wide yard, with an underground cistern that served to collect and preserve water for residents. In the neighborhood were public facilities like a bath house, a flour storehouse, a bakery, a synagogue and Torah school. Around the common yard, single-story residences were built to face the yard. M. N. Kohanov in his book Sha'alu Shlom Yerushalayim (1969‚Äì1970) writes: > About six reese [a biblical measurement] walk from Even Yisrael straight up > Jaffa Road there is the Beit Ya'akov group on the downslope of the mountain, > it was founded in 1875 from 70 people, so the group and city named it \\"Beit > Ya'akov\\" like the 70 people in Jacob's family [who went to Egypt]. Until now > there stand twenty houses, a large pit, and a large and beautiful Beth > Midrash. This group, though its leaders are honored and active, most of them > are poor and miserable and cannot pay the costs for each one. Grievsky in his book adds: > This neighborhood, when it was founded in 1876-7, was too far from the city. > The surrounding was a desolate desert with jagged rocks. People arriving > from Yafo passed by, riding on donkeys and horses. ... And here, of all > places, the builders decided to pave a road for all comers and to establish > a neighborhood for Jews, and they called it Beit Ya'akov. Establishment of the neighborhood suffered great difficulties. The 70 families took upon themselves to build houses, and about two years after the group came together, the first foundations were laid, but in the year of foundations only 15 houses were built, and the other members of the group acquired bare fields. Until 1881 the neighborhood had only 20 houses. In the first years, because of the isolation of the neighborhood, the few men had to rotate night guard duty to prevent raids by Arabs who lived in the surrounding area.

The text is read as \\"MAQQI IARI (K)[OI] MAQQI MUCCOI DOVVINIAS\\", commemorating \\"Mac-Iari\\", a member of the Corco Duibne. Drawn by Cork architect and antiquarian Richard Rolt Brash (1817‚Äì1876) and published in 1879 in his posthumous work The Ogam Inscribed Monuments of the Gaedhil in the British islands. The Corcu Duibne, which means \\"seed or tribe of Duibhne\\" (the name of a goddess), was a notable kingdom in prehistoric and medieval County Kerry, Ireland which included the Dingle Peninsula, the Iveragh Peninsula and connecting lands. The tribe belonged to the √ârainn and claimed descent from the legendary Conaire M√≥r, possibly making them distant cousins of such far off kingdoms as D√°l Riata in Ulster and Scotland, as well as the closer M√∫scraige and Corcu Baiscind.Byrne, pp. 63, 171, 174 All the tribes belonged to the S√≠l Conairi of legend and ultimately traced their descent from the Clanna Dedad.  Septs and relations with other kingdoms  The ruling septs of the Corcu Duibne were O'Shea and O'Falvey, and possibly O'Connell.Mumu, the Kingdom of Munster Noted creators of ogham inscriptions, with over one third of all Irish inscriptions found in their region,MacNeill 1909, p. 334 the existence of the Corcu Duibne is attested as early as the 5th century.MacCotter, p. 168 These tell us they claimed descent from a female ancestor DOVINIA.Byrne, pp. 166‚Äì7MacNeill 1909, p. 334MacCotter, p. 168 The Iron Age mountaintop fortress Caherconree, preserving the name of the legendary C√∫ Ro√≠, a cousin of Conaire M√≥r, is found on the Dingle Peninsula, the name of which in Modern Irish is Corca Dhuibhne. Relations between the Corcu Duibne and the nearby E√≥ganacht Locha L√©in are poorly understood, but it appears they spent at least some period of time under the nominal overlordship of the latter in the powerful, but relatively short-lived Kingdom of Iarmuman.Byrne, p. 207 Rule from distant overkingdom of E√≥ganacht Chaisil is not apparent and so it is likely that the Corcu Duibne kingdom had an independent, if remote, existence in the first millennium. Legendary origins The 8th-century text known as The Expulsion of the D√©isi attributes to the Corcu Duibne an eponymous founder, Corc Duibne, a scion of the branch of the √ârainn royal line called the S√≠l Conairi, after Conaire M√≥r. In particular, the later \\"B version\\" of the text includes a lengthy episode describing Corc's birth and childhood deeds. Corc and his twin brother Cormac are born of incest to Coirpre M√∫sc (a quo M√∫scraige) and Duihind, children of Conaire C√≥em, a descendant of Conaire M√≥r. Their conception causes the crops to fail, and the people determine to immolate them to remove their curse. However, a druid steps in and offers to take Corc to an offshore island so that the abomination is out of Ireland. Reciting a poem predicting great things for Corc's descendants, the druid and his wife Bo√≠ take the boy to the remote island of Inis Bo√≠. Every morning for the next year, Bo√≠ performs a purification ritual in which she gives Corc an ablution while he is seated on the back of an otherworldly white cow with red ears. Finally one morning Corc's curse leaves him and enters the cow, who jumps into the ocean and turns to stone, becoming the rock of B√≥ Bo√≠. Bo√≠ takes Corc to his grandmother, S√°rait, daughter of Conn C√©tchathach, and eventually convinces her to take him back.This Is The Cause Of The Expulsion Of The D√©ssi To Munster And The Violent Death Of Cormac, sect. 9‚Äì11. When he is older Corc is sent to serve as hostage in the court of Cormac mac Airt, King of Tara. There he is fostered by √ìengus Ga√≠b√∫aibthech, a leader of the D√©isi. When √ìengus and his people are expelled from Tara over a bloody dispute with the king's son, Corc absconds from hostageship and joins his foster-father, fighting beside him in many battles. Eventually the D√©isi wander to the southern coast, and come to the island where Corc was reared. He tries to convince them to settle there, but they elect to move farther north. Corc remains, and founds his dynasty.This Is The Cause Of The Expulsion Of The D√©ssi To Munster And The Violent Death Of Cormac, sect. 5; 8; 12.

The eponymous ancestor of the family was Ruaidhr√≠ mac Raghnaill, a principal member of Clann Somhairle in the thirteenth century. Members of Clann Ruaidhr√≠ were factors in both the histories of the Kingdom of the Isles and the Kingdom of Scotland in the thirteenth- and fourteenth centuries. The family appears to have held power in Kintyre in the thirteenth century. By the fourteenth century, the family controlled an extensive provincial lordship stretching along north-western Scottish coast and into the Hebrides. As a leading force in the Kingdom of the Isles, the family fiercely opposed Scottish authority. With the collapse of Norwegian hegemony in the region, the family nimbly integrated itself into the Kingdom of Scotland. Members of Clann Ruaidhr√≠ distinguished themselves in the First War of Scottish Independence, opposing adherents of both the English and Scottish Crowns. Like other branches of Clann Somhairle, Clann Ruaidhr√≠ was a noted exporter of gallowglass warriors into Ireland.McNamee (2010). The mid fourteenth century saw the diminishment of the family in both Scotland and Ireland. The last Irish gallowglass captain appears on record in 1342, whilst the last great chief of the family was assassinated in 1346. Following the latter's death, the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ lordship passed into the possession of the chief of Clann Domhnaill, a distant Clann Somhairle kinsman, and thereby formed a significant part of the Clann Domhnaill Lordship of the Isles. There is reason to suspect that the lines of the family may have continued on, albeit in a much diminished capacity, with one apparent member holding power as late as the early fifteenth century.

Somhairle's abrupt death in battle in 1164, coupled with the vast territorial extent of his offspring, may account for the rapid fracturing of Clann Somhairle into rival segments.MacGregor, M (2001). The title of the apparent Clann Ruaidhr√≠ wife of R«´gnvaldr Gu√∞r√∏√∞arson as it appears on folio 42v of British Library Cotton Julius A VII (the Chronicle of Mann): \\"regina Insularum\\" (\\"Queen of the Isles\\").McDonald (2007) pp. 79, 163; Anderson (1922) p. 458; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 86‚Äì87; Cotton MS Julius A VII (n.d.). Ruaidhr√≠ was probably the senior of Raghnall's sons.Woolf (2007) p. 79; Barrow (1988a) p. 5. Whilst Ruaidhr√≠ is likely one of the unnamed sons of Raghnall who is recorded to have campaigned with Thomas fitz Roland, Earl of Atholl against the Irish in 1211/1212,Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1211.3; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1211.3; Annals of Loch C√© (2008) ¬ß 1211.7; Duffy (2007) p. 10; Annala Uladh (2005) ¬ß 1212.4; Annals of Loch C√© (2005) ¬ß 1211.7; Pollock, M (2005) p. 27; Annala Uladh (2003) ¬ß 1212.4; Duffy (2002) p. 56; Oram (2000) p. 117; McDonald (1997) p. 80; Duffy (1993) pp. 67, 77. he is certainly reported to have assisted Thomas in the ravaging of Derry and surrounding countryside in 1213/1214.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1213.3; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1213.3; Annals of Loch C√© (2008) ¬ß 1213.6; Duffy (2007) p. 10; Ross (2007); Annala Uladh (2005) ¬ß 1214.2; Annals of Loch C√© (2005) ¬ß 1213.6; Pollock, M (2005) p. 27; Annala Uladh (2003) ¬ß 1214.2; Oram (2000) p. 117; McDonald (1997) p. 80; Duffy (1993) pp. 67, 77. On one hand, these seaborne operations may have been undertaken in the context of supporting the Irish interests of R«´gnvaldr Gu√∞r√∏√∞arson, King of the Isles, who seems to have been under pressure at about this period.Pollock, M (2005) pp. 26‚Äì27, 27 n. 138. It is also possible that the raids were conducted in specific regard to the interests of both the Scottish and English Crowns, and particularly aimed at limiting Irish support of the Meic Uilleim,Oram (2011a) p. 171; Ross (2007). a discontented rival branch of the Scottish royal family.Ross (2007).

Rawl. B. 489 (n.d.). By the second decade of the thirteenth century, Ruaidhr√≠ may have been the principal member of Clann Somhairle,Woolf (2007) pp. 80‚Äì82. and appears to have overseen an important marital alliance with the two foremost members of the Crovan dynasty. For example, R«´gnvaldr, and his younger half-brother √ìl√°fr, are recorded to have married the daughters of an unidentified nobleman from Kintyre,McDonald (2019) pp. 60, 66; McDonald (2007) pp. 78, 116‚Äì117, 152; Woolf (2007) p. 81; Pollock, M (2005) p. 27 n. 138; Brown, M (2004) pp. 76‚Äì78; Oram (2000) p. 125; McDonald (1997) p. 85; Anderson (1922) p. 457; Munch; Goss (1874a) pp. 84‚Äì85. and the fact that Ruaidhr√≠ and his father are known to have been styled Lord of Kintyre suggests that either man could have been the father of the brides.Oram (2011a) p. 189; McDonald (2007) pp. 117, 117 n. 68, 152; Woolf (2007) p. 81; Pollock, M (2005) pp. 4, 27 n. 138; Woolf (2004) p. 107; Oram (2000) p. 125. The marital alliance appears to have been orchestrated in an effort to patch up relations between Clann Somhairle and the Crovan dynasty, neighbouring kindreds who had bitterly contested the kingship of the Isles for about sixty years.Oram (2013); McDonald (2007) p. 117; Woolf (2007) p. 81. It is possible that R«´gnvaldr's kingship was formally recognised by Ruaidhr√≠, who thereby established himself as a leading magnate within a reunified Kingdom of the Isles.Oram (2013); Woolf (2007) p. 81. Since the majority of Ruaidhr√≠'s territories appear to have been mainland possessions, it is very likely that the Scottish Crown regarded this reunification as a threat to its own claims of overlordship of Argyll. Apprehension of this rejuvenated island realm may have been one of the factors that led to Ruaidhr√≠'s apparent expulsion from Kintyre by the royal forces of Alexander II, King of Scotland in the early 1220s.Oram (2013); McDonald (2007) p. 117; Woolf (2007) pp. 81‚Äì82. Dubhghall mac Ruaidhr√≠, and Ail√©an mac Ruaidhr√≠ Ail√©an and Dubhghall, as they appear on folio 122v of AM 45 fol (Codex Frisianus): \\"Aleinn bro√∞ir Dvggals konvngs\\".Unger (1871) p. 576 ch. 331; AM 45 Fol (n.d.). The excerpt notes the brothers' kinship and styles Dubhghall a king. There is reason to suspect that Ruaidhr√≠ is identical to the Clann Somhairle dynast, named in surviving sources only as Mac Somhairle, who was killed whilst resisting an English invasion of T√≠r Chonaill in 1247.Oram (2013) ch. 6; Woolf (2007) pp. 79‚Äì80; McLeod (2005) p. 42, n. 77; Power (2005) p. 46; Brown, M (2004) pp. 80‚Äì81; Duffy (2004) p. 47; Woolf (2004) p. 108; McLeod (2002) p. 31; Sellar (2000) pp. 200‚Äì201. Immediately after this event, Clann Ruaidhr√≠ was certainly represented by Ruaidhr√≠'s son, Dubhghall.Beuermann (2010) p. 108, 108 n. 28. Under the later, the kindred certainly involved itself against the English in Ireland. In 1258, Dubhghall is recorded to have clashed with and killed Jordan d'Exeter, the English Sheriff of Connacht.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1258.13; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1258.13; Ann√°la Connacht (2011a) ¬ß¬ß 1258.6‚Äì1258.8; Ann√°la Connacht (2011b) ¬ß¬ß 1258.6‚Äì1258.8; Annals of Loch C√© (2008) ¬ß 1258.5; Duffy (2007) pp. 17‚Äì18; Woolf (2007) p. 85; Annals of Loch C√© (2005) ¬ß 1258.5; Power (2005) p. 49; Verstraten (2003) p. 36 n. 131; Duffy (2002) pp. 57‚Äì58; Sellar (2000) p. 206, 206 n. 97; McDonald (1997) p. 118; Walton (1980) pp. 160, 234 n. 134, 506; Anderson (1922) pp. 594‚Äì595, 594 n. 4, 595 n. 1; Connemara (n.d.); The Annals of Connacht, p. 127 (n.d.). The following year, Aodh na nGall √ì Conchobhair, son of the U√≠ Conchobhair King of Connacht, is recorded to have married a daughter of Dubhghall, and to have received a tocher of one hundred and sixty gallowglass warriors commanded by Dubhghall's younger brother, Ail√©an.Downham (2018) p. 229; Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1259.5; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1259.5; Ann√°la Connacht (2011a) ¬ß 1259.6; Ann√°la Connacht (2011b) ¬ß 1259.6; Annals of Loch C√© (2008) ¬ß 1259.3; Lydon (2008) pp. 245, 248; Duffy (2007) pp. 1, 10 n. 43, 18; Kenny (2007) p. 68; Kenny (2006) p. 33; Annals of Loch C√© (2005) ¬ß 1259.3; Kenny (2005) p. 103; McLeod (2005) p. 43, n. 79; Power (2005) p. 49; Verstraten (2003) pp. 26, 36 n. 131; Duffy (2002) pp. 57‚Äì58; Simms (2001) p. 6; Sellar (2000) p. 206, 206 n. 99; Simms (2000a) pp. 121‚Äì122; Simms (2000b) p. 157 n. 62; McDonald (1997) pp. 118, 155; Simms (1997) p. 110; Lydon (1992) p. 7; Walton (1980) pp. 233‚Äì234, 234 n. 134; Derry (n.d.); The Annals of Connacht, p. 131 (n.d.). Ail√©an is, therefore, one of the earliest known warriors of this type.Duffy (2002) p. 60. Along with Dubhghall's naval operations of the previous year, the marital alliance between the U√≠ Conchobhair and Clann Ruaidhr√≠ appears to have formed part of a carefully coordinated plan to tackle English power in the north west of Ireland.Duffy (2007) pp. 17‚Äì18. Nevertheless, Aodh na nGall and his allies were utterly crushed in battle in 1260,Duffy (2007) pp. 18‚Äì19; Simms (2005a); Simms (2005b); Verstraten (2005); Verstraten (2003) pp. 27, 36 n. 142; Verstraten (2002) p. 15; Simms (2001) p. 6; Simms (1998) p. 80; Lydon (1994) p. 153; Moody; Martin (1994) p. 432. a conflict in which the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ gallowglasses may well have fought.Lydon (2008) p. 245; Duffy (2007) p. 19. rook gaming pieces of the so-called Lewis chessmen.Caldwell; Hall; Wilkinson (2009) pp. 161 fig. 6g, 185 fig. 12. The Scandinavian connections of leading members of the Isles may have been reflected in their military armament, and could have resembled that depicted upon such gaming pieces.Strickland (2012) p. 113. The year after Mac Somhairle's death in 1247, Dubhghall and the chief of Clann Dubhghaill, E√≥ghan Mac Dubhghaill, both travelled to Norway seeking the kingship of the northern ' from H√°kon H√°konarson, King of Norway.Oram (2013) ch. 6; W√¶rdahl (2011) p. 49; Beuermann (2010) p. 108; Woolf (2007) p. 83; Murray, N (2005) pp. 302‚Äì304; Power (2005) p. 46; Brown, M (2004) p. 80; Sellar (2004a); Tabraham (2004) p. 23; McLeod (2002) p. 30; Sellar (2000) pp. 203‚Äì204, 206; McDonald (1997) pp. 68, 98‚Äì99; Cowan (1990) p. 115; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 207; Anderson (1922) p. 548; J√≥nsson (1916) p. 627 ch. 287; Kj√¶r (1910) p. 608 ch. 304/259; Dasent (1894) p. 266 ch. 259; Vigfusson (1887) p. 255 ch. 259; Unger (1871) p. 535 ch. 264; Flateyjarbok (1868) pp. 174‚Äì175 ch. 230. Although the entirety of the ' roughly encompassed the Hebrides and Mann,Dumville (2018) p. 113; McDonald (2012) p. 152; Williams (2007) pp. 130‚Äì132 n. 8. the precise jurisdiction which Dubhghall and E√≥ghan competed for is uncertain. For example, the northern Hebridean islands of Lewis and Harris and Skye appear to have been held by the Crovan dynasty, then represented by the reigning Haraldr √ìl√°fsson, King of the Isles.McDonald (1997) p. 99; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 207. Whatever the case, it is possible that the events of 1247 and 1248 were related,Oram (2013) ch. 6; Woolf (2007) p. 83; Sellar (2000) p. 201. and that Dubhghall and E√≥ghan sought to succeed Mac Somhairle's position in the Isles.Woolf (2007) pp. 83‚Äì84. It was only after the unexpected death of Haraldr in 1248 that H√°kon sent E√≥ghan west over sea to temporarily take up the kingship of the Isles on his behalf.McDonald (2019) p. 33; Oram (2013) ch. 6; W√¶rdahl (2011) p. 49, 49 n. 66; Beuermann (2010) p. 108, 108 n. 29; Woolf (2007) p. 84; Power (2005) p. 46; Sellar (2004a); Stringer (2004); Carpenter (2003) ch. 10 ¬∂ 80; Sellar (2000) p. 204; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 207. E√≥ghan, however, was not only a Norwegian dependant in the Isles, but an eminent Scottish magnate on the mainland.Oram (2013) ch. 6; Sellar (2004a); Woolf (2004) p. 108. Although the Scottish Crown appears to have attempted to purchase the Isles earlier that decade,Dahlberg (2014) pp. 52‚Äì55; Oram (2013) ch. 6; Oram (2011b) ch. 13; Murray, N (2005) p. 303; Oram (2005b) p. 42; Reid (2005) p. 59; Stringer (2004); Carpenter (2003) ch. 10 ¬∂ 80; Bartlett (1999) pp. 823‚Äì824; Cowan (1990) p. 110; Barrow (1981) p. 115. E√≥ghan's acceptance of H√°kon's commission led Alexander II to unleash an invasion of Argyll in the summer of 1249, directed at the very heart of the Clann Dubhghaill lordship.Oram (2013) ch. 6; Oram (2011b) ch. 13; Oram (2005b) p. 42; Brown, M (2004) p. 80; Sellar (2004a); Stringer (2004); Carpenter (2003) ch. 10 ¬∂ 80; Sellar (2000) p. 204; Barrow (1981) pp. 115‚Äì116. The unfolding crisis only ended with the Scottish king's untimely death in July 1249.Oram (2013) ch. 6; W√¶rdahl (2011) p. 49; Murray, N (2005) pp. 304‚Äì305; Oram (2005b) pp. 42‚Äì43; Power (2005) p. 47; Brown, M (2004) p. 80; Sellar (2004a); Woolf (2004) p. 108; Sellar (2000) p. 204; Cowan (1990) pp. 115‚Äì116; Barrow (1981) pp. 115‚Äì116. E√≥ghan appears to have been utterly dispossessed by the Scots a result of their invasion.McDonald (1997) pp. 103‚Äì104. In fact, his apparent displacement could well have upended the hierarchy of Clann Somhairle.McDonald (1997) pp. 99, 104. For instance, within the very year that E√≥ghan was forced from Argyll by the Scots, Dubhghall is recorded to have \\"took kingship\\" in the Isles.Raven (2005a) p. 58; McDonald (1997) pp. 99, 104; Storm (1977) pp. 132, 190, 482; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 212 n. 2; Anderson (1922) p. 554, 554 n. 2; Vigfusson (1878) p. 374.

About a decade later, the latter's son and royal successor, Alexander III, came of age and took steps to continue his father's westward expansion.W√¶rdahl (2011) p. 49; Alexander; Neighbour; Oram (2002) p. 18. In 1261, the Scottish Crown sent envoys to Norway offering to purchase the Hebrides from H√°kon. Once the Norwegians rejected the offer, the Scots are recorded to have lashed out against the Islesmen in a particularly savage assault upon the inhabitants of Skye.Martin, C (2014) p. 186; W√¶rdahl (2011) pp. 49‚Äì50; Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 255‚Äì256; Woolf (2004) p. 108; Alexander; Neighbour; Oram (2002) p. 18; McDonald (1997) pp. 105‚Äì107; Duffy (1993) p. 109; Cowan (1990) pp. 117‚Äì118, 130 n. 70. Thus provoked, H√°kon assembled an enormous fleet to reassert Norwegian sovereignty along the north and western coast of Scotland.Alexander; Neighbour; Oram (2002) p. 18; McDonald (1997) p. 107. In July 1263, this armada disembarked from Norway, and by mid August, H√°kon reaffirmed his overlordship in Shetland and Orkney, forced the submission of Caithness, and arrived in the Hebrides.Alexander; Neighbour; Oram (2002) p. 18; McDonald (1997) pp. 107‚Äì108.

Not only had H√°kon failed to break Scottish power, but Alexander III seized the initiative in the following year, and oversaw a series of invasions into the Isles and northern Scotland. Recognising this dramatic shift in royal authority, Magn√∫s √ìl√°fsson, King of Mann and the Isles submitted to Alexander III within the year,Forte; Oram; Pedersen (2005) pp. 261‚Äì262; McDonald (1997) pp. 115‚Äì116; Reid (1984) pp. 18‚Äì19; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) pp. 213‚Äì214. and in so doing, symbolised the complete collapse of Norwegian sovereignty in the Isles.Brown, M (2004) p. 84; Reid (1984) pp. 18‚Äì19. Dubhghall, on the other hand, contrasted many of his compatriots from the Isles, and stubbornly refused to submit to the Scottish Crown.Brown, M (2004) p. 84; McDonald (1997) pp. 116, 118; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 214.

Although it is possible that Dubhghall's power base had been located in GarmoranSellar (2000) p. 206; Cowan (1990) p. 115. and perhaps Uist,Sellar (2000) p. 206. there is uncertainty as to how and when these territories entered into the possession of his family.Raven (2005a) pp. 56‚Äì58; Rixson (2001) p. 86.

On the other hand, the family's position in Garmoran and the Hebrides may have stemmed from its marital alliance with the Crovan dynasty, an affiliation undertaken at some point before Ruaidhr√≠'s expulsion from Kintyre.Raven (2005a) pp. 57‚Äì58; Woolf (2003) p. 178.

Kingdom of Scotland The arms attributed to the King of Mann depicted in the late thirteenth-century Armorial Wijnbergen. Ail√©an mac Ruaidhr√≠ In the wake of the Scots' acquisition of the Isles, and Dubhghall's death within the decade, Clann Ruaidhr√≠ disappears from the Scottish historical record. When the kindred finally reemerges in 1275, it is in the person of Ail√©an himself, by then a prominent Scottish magnate,McDonald (2004) pp. 181, 183‚Äì184; McDonald (1997) pp. 130‚Äì131. and representative of Clann Ruaidhr√≠.Holton (2017) p. 147. That year, Magn√∫s' illegitimate son, Gu√∞r√∏√∞r, led a revolt on Mann against the Scottish Crown, and Alexander III responded by sending a massive invasion force to restore royal authority. Of the recorded Scottish commanders, two were members of Clann Somhairle: Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, Lord of Argyll, and Ail√©an himself.Pollock, MA (2015) pp. 192‚Äì193, 193 n. 189; McDonald (2007) pp. 54, 91 n. 18, 100 n. 56, 107; Raven (2005a) p. 60; McDonald (2004) p. 183; Oram (2000) p. 156; Sellar (2000) p. 210; McDonald (1997) p. 137; Duffy (1993) p. 163; Anderson (1922) pp. 672‚Äì673, 673 n. 1; Maxwell (1913) p. 11; Anderson (1908) pp. 382‚Äì383; Howlett (1885) pp. 570‚Äì571; Munch; Goss (1874) pp. 110‚Äì111, 232; Stevenson (1839) pp. 97‚Äì98. The Clann Somhairle dimension to this campaign, as agents of the Scottish Crown's authority, clearly exemplifies the extent at which the kindred had been incorporated into Scottish realm.McDonald (2004) p. 183; Carpenter (2003) ch. 12 ¬∂ 42; Young (1990) p. 23. In 1284, Ail√©an was one of the many Scottish magnates who attended a government council at Scone which acknowledged Margaret, granddaughter of Alexander III, as the king's rightful heir.McDonald (2006) p. 77; Power (2005) p. 54; Raven (2005a) p. 60; Brown, M (2004) p. 85; Sellar (2000) p. 210; McDonald (1997) pp. 130, 136, 189; Young (1990) p. 22; Barrow (1981) p. 119; Barrow (1973) p. 380; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 216; The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland (1844) p. 424; Document 4/42/5 (n.d.). The inclusion of Ail√©an, and two of his Clann Somhairle kinsmen‚ÄîAlasdair Mac Dubhghaill and Aonghus M√≥r mac Domhnaill, Lord of Islay‚Äîfurther illustrates the kindred's incorporation within the Scottish realm.McDonald (2006) p. 77; Smith (1998); McDonald (1997) p. 136.

The former region‚Äîconsisting of Wester Ross, Glenelg, Skye, Lewis and Harris, Uist, Barra, Eigg, Rhum, and the Small Isles‚Äîwas given to William II, Earl of Ross, whilst the latter region‚Äîconsisting of Argyll (except Cowal and Kintyre), Mull, Jura and Islay‚Äîwas given to Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill.Cochran-Yu (2015) pp. 49‚Äì50, 50 n. 3; Cameron (2014) p. 152; Petre (2014) pp. 270‚Äì272; Brown, M (2011) p. 15; Brown, M (2004) p. 258; Barrow (1973) p. 383; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) pp. 216‚Äì217; The Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland (1844) p. 447; RPS, 1293/2/16 (n.d.a); RPS, 1293/2/16 (n.d.b); RPS, 1293/2/17 (n.d.); RPS, 1293/2/17 (n.d.b). Despite the king's intentions, his new sheriffs seem to have used their positions to exploit royal power against local rivals. Whilst Clann Domhnaill was forced to deal with their powerful Clann Dubhghaill rivals, Clann Ruaidhr√≠ appears to have fallen afoul of the Earl of Ross over control of Kintail, Skye, and Uist.Cochran-Yu (2015) pp. 50‚Äì51; Brown, M (2011) pp. 15‚Äì16; Boardman, S (2006) p. 19; Brown, M (2004) p. 258. Evidence of the earl's actions against Clann Ruaidhr√≠ is revealed in correspondence between him and the English Crown in 1304. In this particular communiqu√©, William II recalled a costly military campaign which he had conducted in the 1290s against rebellious Hebridean chieftains‚Äîincluding Lachlann himself‚Äîat the behest of the then-reigning John (reigned 1292‚Äì1296).Cochran-Yu (2015) pp. 50‚Äì51, 63‚Äì64; Brown, M (2011) p. 15; Brown, M (2008) pp. 31‚Äì32; Boardman, S (2006) p. 19; Brown, M (2004) p. 258; Bain (1884) pp. 434‚Äì435 ¬ß 1631, 435 ¬ß 1632; Document 3/20/5 (n.d); Document 3/20/6 (n.d). Ail√©an seems to have died at some point before 1296.McDonald (1997) p. 189; Barrow (1973) p. 380. That year, Edward I, King of England invaded and conquered Scotland.Prestwich (2008); Brown, M (2004) p. 259. One of the Scottish king's most ardent supporters had been Alasdair Mac Dubhghaill, a fact which appears to have led Edward I to use the former's chief rival, Alasdair √ìg Mac Domhnaill, Lord of Islay, as his principal agent in the maritime west. In this capacity, this Clann Domhnaill chief attempted to contain the Clann Dubhghaill revolt against English authority.Watson (2013) ch. 2; McNamee (2012) ch. 3; Young; Stead (2010) pp. 68‚Äì69; Brown, M (2004) pp. 258‚Äì259; Rotuli Scoti√¶ (1814) p. 40; Document 5/1/0 (n.d.). seal of Alasdair √ìg Mac Domhnaill,McAndrew (2006) p. 67; McDonald (1995) p. 132; Munro, J; Munro, RW (1986) p. 281; Rixson (1982) pp. 128, 219 n. 2; Macdonald (1904) p. 227 ¬ß 1793; MacDonald; MacDonald (1896) pp. 88‚Äì89; Laing, H (1866) p. 91 ¬ß 536. a Clann Somhairle opponent of Lachlann and Ruaidhr√≠. The struggle between the two Clann Somhairle namesakes seems to be documented in two undated letters from Alasdair √ìg to Edward I. Whilst the first reveals that Clann Ruaidhr√≠ warred against Clann Domhnaill with Clann Dubhghaill,Cochran-Yu (2015) pp. 56‚Äì57; Watson (2013) ch. 2, ch. 2 n. 52; Barrow (2006) p. 147; Brown, M (2004) p. 259; Barrow (2003) p. 347; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 60; McDonald (1997) pp. 165, 190; Barrow (1988b) pp. 107, 347 n. 104; Rixson (1982) pp. 13‚Äì15, 208 n. 2, 208 n. 4; Barrow (1973) p. 381; List of Diplomatic Documents (1963) p. 193; Stevenson (1870) p. 187‚Äì188 ¬ß 444; Bain (1884) pp. 235‚Äì236 ¬ß 904; Document 3/0/0 (n.d.b). the latter letter corroborates this alignment and violence, and also evinces cooperation with the Comyn kindred as well.Cochran-Yu (2015) pp. 56‚Äì57, 60; Watson (2013) ch. 2, ch. 2 n. 52; Brown, M (2009) pp. 10‚Äì11; Fisher (2005) p. 93; Barrow (2003) p. 347; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 60; Sellar (2000) p. 212; McDonald (1997) pp. 154, 165; Barrow (1988b) pp. 107, 347 n. 104; Rixson (1982) pp. 15‚Äì16, 208 n. 4, 208 n. 6; Barrow (1973) p. 381; List of Diplomatic Documents (1963) p. 193; Stevenson (1870) pp. 189‚Äì191 ¬ß 445; Bain (1884) p. 235 ¬ß 903; Document 3/0/0 (n.d.c). These dispatches seem to reveal that Lachlann and Ruaidhr√≠ were focused upon seizing control of Skye and Lewis and Harris from the absentee Earl of Ross,Cochran-Yu (2015) pp. 57, 95‚Äì96. a man who endured imprisonment in England from 1296 to 1303.Cochran-Yu (2015) pp. 51‚Äì55, 95‚Äì96. The bitter strife between Clann Ruaidhr√≠ and Clann Domhnaill depicted by these letters seems to indicate that both kindreds sought to capitalise on the earl's absence, and that both sought to incorporate the islands into their own lordships. In specific regard to Clann Ruaidhr√≠, it is likely that their campaigning was an extension of the conflict originating from the creation of the shrievalty of Ross in 1293.Cochran-Yu (2015) pp. 95‚Äì96.

Two years later, Robert Bruce VII, Earl of Carrick, a claimant to the Scottish throne, killed his chief rival to the kingship, John Comyn III, Lord of Badenoch.Barrow (2008); Young (2004); McDonald (1997) p. 169. Although the former seized the throne (as Robert I) by March, the English Crown immediately struck back, defeating his forces in June. By September, Robert I was a fugitive, and appears to have escaped into the Hebrides.Barrow (2008); McDonald (1997) pp. 170‚Äì174. According to a fourteenth-century chronicle, Ail√©an's daughter, Cairist√≠ona, played an instrumental part in Robert I's survival at this low point in his career, sheltering him along Scotland's western seaboard.Caldwell, DH (2016) p. 360; Penman, M (2014) pp. 104, 359 n. 82; Caldwell, DH (2012) p. 284; Young; Stead (2010) p. 92; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 49 n. 6, 55 n. 61;McDonald (2006) p. 79; Barrow (2003) p. 347; Duffy (2002) p. 60; McDonald (1997) pp. 174, 189, 196; Goldstein (1991) p. 279 n. 32; Barrow (1988b) p. 170; Reid (1984) pp. 293‚Äì294; Barrow (1973) pp. 380‚Äì381; Skene, WF (1872) p. 335 ch. 121; Skene, WF (1871) p. 343 ch. 121.

Although Cairist√≠ona was Ail√©an's sole legitimate offspring,Ewan (2006). it is unlikely that members of Clann Ruaidhr√≠ would have regarded legitimate birth as the sole qualification of succession.Barrow (1973) p. 381. In fact, as the leading male member of Clann Ruaidhr√≠, it is probable that Ruaidhr√≠ himself possessed control of the kindred's wide-ranging territories.Raven (2005a) p. 63; Barrow (1988b) pp. 290‚Äì291; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203; Barrow (1973) p. 381. Nevertheless, Ruaidhr√≠ seems to have only gained formal recognition of his rights to the lordship after Cairist√≠ona's resignation of her own claims.MacDonald (2013) p. 353; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 46, 54 n. 52, 55 n. 61; Raven (2005a) p. 63; Boardman, SI (2004); Brown, M (2004) p. 263; Duffy (1993) p. 207 n. 75; Barrow (1988b) pp. 290‚Äì291; Easson (1986) pp. 21, 60, 133, 151; Rixson (1982) p. 27 fig. 2; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203; Macphail (1916) p. 235; Thomson (1912) pp. 428‚Äì429 ¬ß 9; MacDonald; MacDonald (1896) pp. 495‚Äì496; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) pp. 201, 363, 366. There is reason to suspect that Cairist√≠ona's stake in the lordship posed a potential threat to Ruaidhr√≠ and his descendants.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 45‚Äì46. Certainly she was married to a member of the comital family of Mar,McNamee (2012) ch. 5; Brown, M (2011) p. 15; Boardman, S (2006) p. 46; Oram (2003) p. 64, 64 n. 84; Barrow (1988b) p. 384. a kindred that was in turn related in marriage to Robert I and his family.McNamee (2012) ch. 5; Barrow (2008); Duncan (2008); Boardman, S (2006) p. 46; Watson (2004a); Barrow (1988b) pp. 44, 141, 383, 384. Furthermore, Cairist√≠ona and her husband had a son, Ruaidhr√≠, who potentially could have sought royal assistance in pursuance of his mother's claims.Boardman, S (2006) p. 46. The name Cairist√≠ona bestowed upon this son could indicate that he was not only named after his maternal grandfather, but that he was regarded as a potential successor to the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ lordship.Boardman, S (2006) p. 55 n. 61. Cairist√≠ona resigned her claims with the condition that, if her brother died without a male heir, her like-named son would secure the inheritance.Boardman, S (2006) p. 55 n. 61; Ewan (2006); Brown, M (2004) p. 263; Barrow (1988b) pp. 290‚Äì291.

On one hand, it is possible that the king orchestrated Ruaidhr√≠'s succession to the lordship as a means of securing support from one of the most powerful families on the western coast. On the other hand, the fact that Cairist√≠ona‚Äîa close personal ally of Robert I‚Äîhad been superseded by Ruaidhr√≠‚Äîa man with a comparatively chequered career‚Äîcould indicate that the latter's consolidation of control was instead the result of internal family politics.Brown, M (2004) p. 263. Whatever the case, Ruaidhr√≠ was likely already regarded as the rightful chief, and the charter itself undeniably brought him under feudal dependence of the Scottish Crown.Barrow (1988b) p. 291. Ruaidhr√≠'s provincial lordship encompassed the mainland territories of Moidart, Arisaig, Morar, and Knoydart; and the island territories of Rhum, Eigg, Barra, St Kilda, and Uist.Daniels (2013) p. 94; Boardman, SI (2004). This dominion, like the great lordships of Annandale and Galloway, was comparable to any of the kingdom's thirteen earldoms.McNamee (2012) ch. 1. There is evidence to suggest that Ruaidhr√≠ assisted the Scottish Crown in its campaigning against the English in Ireland, and that he lost his life in the crushing Scottish defeat at the Battle of Faughart in 1318.Daniels (2013) p. 94; Brown (2008) pp. 143, 153; Boardman, S (2006) pp. 45‚Äì46; Boardman, SI (2004); Caldwell, DH (2004) p. 72; Duffy (2002) pp. 61, 194 n. 64; Bannerman (1998) p. 25; McDonald (1997) p. 191; Roberts (1997) pp. 144, 181; Duffy (1993) pp. 206‚Äì207; Barrow (1988b) p. 377 n. 103; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203.

This source is mirrored by several other Irish annals including the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Connacht,Penman, MA (2014) p. 71; Boardman, S (2012) p. 237; Ann√°la Connacht (2011a) ¬ß 1318.8; Ann√°la Connacht (2011b) ¬ß 1318.8; McLeod (2002) p. 31 n. 24; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 77; Davies (2000) p. 175 n. 14; Duffy (1998) p. 79; Duffy (1993) pp. 206‚Äì207; Dundalk (n.d.); Mac Domhnaill, King of Argyll (n.d.); The Annals of Connacht, p. 253 (n.d.). the seventeenth-century Annals of the Four Masters,Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1318.5; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1318.5; McLeod (2002) p. 31 n. 24; Duffy (1998) pp. 79, 102. the fifteenth- to sixteenth-century Annals of Ulster, and the seventeenth- century Annals of Clonmacnoise.McLeod (2002) p. 31 n. 24; Barrow (1988b) p. 377 n. 103; Murphy (1896) p. 281. The precise identities of the men named by such sources are unknown for certain, although they seem to have been the heads of Clann Ruaidhr√≠ and Clann Domhnaill,Duffy (2002) pp. 61, 194 n. 64; McQueen (2002) p. 287 n. 18; Duffy (1991) p. 312; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203. and the former man may well have been Ruaidhr√≠ himself. Another major engagement that featured Clann Ruaidhr√≠ was the final defeat of Ruaidhr√≠ √ì Conchobair, King of Connacht at the hands of Feidhlimidh √ì Conchobair, when a certain Donnchadh Mac Ruaidhr√≠ and one hundred gallowglasses fell with the king.Ann√°la Connacht (2011a) ¬ß 1316.3; Ann√°la Connacht (2011b) ¬ß 1316.3; Annals of Loch C√© (2008) ¬ß 1316.2; Annala Uladh (2005) ¬ß 1313.1; Annals of Loch C√© (2005) ¬ß 1316.2; Annala Uladh (2003) ¬ß 1313.1; Duffy (1993) pp. 173‚Äì174; Walton (1980) p. 351; Murphy (1896) p. 276; A Hundred Galloglasses (n.d.); AU, 1313 (n.d.); Donnchad mac Ruaidhri (n.d.); The Annals of Connacht, p. 249 (n.d.); The Annals of Connacht, p. 2435 (n.d.).

The following year, in 1317, Clann Ruaidhr√≠ was a participant in another crushing defeat, when the forces of Connacht vanquished those of Br√©ifne.Ann√°la Connacht (2011a) ¬ß 1317.8; Ann√°la Connacht (2011b) ¬ß 1317.8; Annals of Loch C√© (2008) ¬ß 1317.7; Annala Uladh (2005) ¬ß 1314.7; Annals of Loch C√© (2005) ¬ß 1317.7; Brown, M (2004) p. 265 n. 14; Annala Uladh (2003) ¬ß 1314.7; Duffy (1993) p. 174; Kilmore (n.d.); Mac Ruaidhri (n.d.b); The Annals of Connacht, p. 251 (n.d.a); The Annals of Connacht, p. 251 (n.d.b). According to one set of annals, seven score gallowglasses of a certain \\"Mac Ruaidri\\" were slain in the encounter.Ann√°la Connacht (2011a) ¬ß 1317.8; Ann√°la Connacht (2011b) ¬ß 1317.8; Brown, M (2004) p. 265 n. 14; Duffy (1993) p. 174; Kilmore (n.d.); Mac Ruaidhri (n.d.b); The Annals of Connacht, p. 251 (n.d.a); The Annals of Connacht, p. 251 (n.d.b). Raghnall Mac Ruaidhr√≠, and Cairist√≠ona Nic Ruaidhr√≠ Robert I.Birch (1905) p. 135 pl. 20. According to a fourteenth- century chronicle, Cairist√≠ona Nic Ruaidhr√≠ was instrumental in the survival of the king early in his reign. Although Ruaidhr√≠ seems to have ensured the continuation of his kindred by formally coming to terms with Robert I and campaigning in Ireland with the latter's brother, there is evidence indicating that the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ inheritance was contested by Cairist√≠ona after his demise.Boardman, S (2006) p. 46; Boardman, SI (2004). Ruaidhr√≠ was survived by a daughter, √Åine,Proctor (2006). and an illegitimate son, Raghnall.Boardman, SI (2004). The latter may well have been under age at the time of Ruaidhr√≠'s death, and it is apparent that Cairist√≠ona and her confederates attempted to seize control of the inheritance.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 45‚Äì47; Ewan (2006). Although Cairist√≠ona is recorded to have resigned her claimed rights to a certain Art√∫r Caimb√©al after Ruaidhr√≠'s death,Boardman, S (2006) pp. 46‚Äì47; Boardman, SI (2005) p. 149 n. 4; Fisher (2005) p. 91; Raven (2005a) p. 63; Boardman, SI (2004); Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 71‚Äì72, 226; McDonald (1997) pp. 189‚Äì190 n. 120; Barrow (1980) p. 139 n. 110; Macphail (1914) p. 110; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) p. 201, 201 n. 1; Document 3/0/0 (n.d.a). it is clear that Raghnall eventually succeeded in securing the region, and was regarded as the chief of Clann Ruaidhr√≠ by most of his kin. In 1325, a certain \\"Roderici de Ylay\\" suffered the forfeiture of his possessions by Robert I.Penman, M (2014) pp. 259‚Äì260, 391 n. 166; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 74‚Äì75, 74‚Äì75 n. 42; Brown, M (2004) p. 267 n. 18; McQueen (2002) p. 287; McDonald (1997) p. 187; Barrow (1988b) p. 299; Steer; Bannerman; Collins (1977) p. 203, 203 n. 12; Duncan; Brown (1956‚Äì1957) p. 205 n. 9; Thomson (1912) p. 557 ¬ß 699; RPS, A1325/2 (n.d.a); RPS, A1325/2 (n.d.b). It is possible that this record refers to a member of Clann Ruaidhr√≠, and that it demonstrates the contrast of relations between Clann Ruaidhr√≠ and the Scottish Crown in the 1320s and 1330s.Penman, M (2014) pp. 259, 391 n. 166; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 74‚Äì75; Penman, M (2008); Penman, MA (2005) pp. 28, 84. If correct, the man in question may be identical to Raghnall himself, which could indicate that his forfeiture was related to Cairist√≠ona's attempt to alienate the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ estate from him and transfer it into the clutches of the Caimb√©alaigh kindred (the Campbells).Penman, M (2014) pp. 259‚Äì260. Another possibility is that the forfeiture was instead ratified in response to undesirable Clann Ruaidhr√≠ expansion into certain neighbouring regions, such as the former territories of the disinherited Clann Dubhghaill.Penman, M (2008). Although Cairist√≠ona's resignation charter to Art√∫r is undated,Boardman, S (2006) p. 55 n. 62. it could date to just before the forfeiture. The list of witnesses who attested this grant is remarkable, and may reveal that the charter had royal approval.Penman, M (2014) p. 260. These men all seem to have been close adherents of Robert I against Clann Dubhghaill, and all represented families of power along the western seaboard. An alliance of such men may well have been an intimidating prospect to the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ leadership.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 46‚Äì47. In fact, the forfeiture could have been personally reinforced by Robert I, as the king seems to have travelled to Tarbert Castle‚Äîa royal stronghold in Kintyre‚Äîwithin the same year.Penman, M (2014) p. 260; Penman, MA (2014) pp. 74‚Äì75 n. 42. Borve Castle was constructed by √Åine Nic Ruaidhr√≠.Stell, G (2014) pp. 273‚Äì274; Raven (2005a) pp. 220‚Äì221; Macphail (1914) p. 26; Sinclair (1794) p. 299. According to the fourteenth-century chronicle, it was one of the principal fortresses along the western seaboard.Stell, G (2014) p. 287; Skene, WF (1872) p. 40; Skene, WF (1871) pp. 43‚Äì44. Unlike the First War of Scottish Independence, in which Clann Ruaidhr√≠ participated, Raghnall and his family are not known to have taken part in the second war (from 1332‚Äì41).Daniels (2013) pp. 25, 94. In fact, Raghnall certainly appears on record by 1337,Daniels (2013) pp. 94‚Äì95; Boardman, SI (2004). when he aided his third cousin, E√≥in Mac Domhnaill I, Lord of the Isles, in the latter's efforts to receive a papal dispensation to marry Raghnall's sister, √Åine, in 1337.Penman, MA (2014) p. 77, 77 n. 51; Boardman, SI (2004); Daniels (2013) pp. 94‚Äì95; Brown, M (2004) p. 270; Macphail (1914) pp. 25 n. 1, 73‚Äì75; Thomson (1911); Stuart (1798) p. 446. At the time, Raghnall and E√≥in were apparently supporters of Edward Balliol,Daniels (2013) pp. 94‚Äì95; Boardman, SI (2004); Penman, MA (2001) p. 166; Boardman, S (1996b) pp. 30‚Äì31 n. 60. a claimant to the Scottish throne who held power in the realm from 1332 to 1336.Webster (2004). By June 1343, however, both Raghnall and E√≥in were reconciled with Edward's rival, the reigning son of Robert I, David II, King of Scotland,Daniels (2013) pp. 94‚Äì95; Caldwell, D (2008) p. 52; Boardman, S (2006) p. 62; Boardman, SI (2004); Penman, MA (2001) p. 166; Boardman, S (1996b) pp. 30‚Äì31 n. 60. and Raghnall himself was confirmed in the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ lordship by the king.Penman, MA (2014) p. 77; Daniels (2013) p. 95; Addyman; Oram (2012); Caldwell, D (2008) p. 52; Boardman, S (2006) p. 87; Raven (2005a) pp. 61, 64; Boardman, SI (2004); Penman, MA (2001) p. 166; Campbell of Airds (2000) p. 83; Thomson (1912) p. 569 ¬ß 861; MacDonald; MacDonald (1900) p. 743; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) p. 201; Robertson (1798) pp. 48 ¬ß 3, 99, 100 ¬ß 2. The arms of the Earl of Ross depicted in Balliol Roll.Chesshyre; Woodcock; Grant et al. (1992) p. 277; McAndrew (2006) p. 136; The Balliol Roll (n.d.). At about this time, Raghnall received the rights to Kintail from William III, Earl of Ross, a transaction which was confirmed by the king that July.Penman, MA (2005) p. 99; Boardman, SI (2004); Penman, MA (2001) p. 166; Boardman, S (1996b) p. 101 n. 43; Munro (1986) pp. 59‚Äì61; MacDonald; MacDonald (1900) p. 744; Thomson (1912) p. 569 ¬ß 860; Robertson (1798) p. 48 ¬ß 2. There is reason to suspect that the king's recognition of this grant may have been intended as a regional counterbalance of sorts, since he also diverted the rights to Skye from E√≥in to William III.Penman, MA (2005) p. 99; Penman, MA (2001) p. 166. It is also possible that Clann Ruaidhr√≠ power had expanded into the coastal region of Kintail at some point after the death of William III's father in 1333, during a period when William III may have been either a minor or exiled from the country. Whatever the case, the earl seems to have had little choice but to relinquish his rights to Kintail to Raghnall.Boardman, SI (2004); Boardman, S (1996b) p. 101 n. 43. Bitterness between these two magnates appears to be evidenced in dramatic fashion by the assassination of Raghnall and several of his followers at the hands of the earl and his adherents.Daniels (2013) pp. 28, 95, 112; Penman, MA (2005) pp. 99, 126; Boardman, SI (2004); Brown, M (2004) p. 271; Boardman, S (1996b) p. 101 n. 43;.

At the time of his demise, Raghnall had been obeying the king's muster at Perth, in preparation for the Scots' imminent invasion of England. Following the deed, William III deserted the royal host, and fled to the safety of his domain.Cochran-Yu (2015) p. 86; Penman, MA (2014) p. 79; Daniels (2013) p. 112; Webster (2011); Munro, R; Munro, J (2008); Penman, MA (2005) pp. 1‚Äì2, 99, 126, 158; Brown, M (2004) pp. 247, 271; Oram (2004) p. 124; Penman, MA (2001) pp. 166, 175‚Äì176; Duncan (1998) pp. 261, 268; Boardman, S (1997) p. 39; Munro (1986) p. 62; Cokayne; White (1949) p. 146, 146 n. d. Although he was later to pay dearly for this act of disloyalty,Daniels (2013) pp. 112‚Äì113. the episode itself evidences the earl's determination to deal with the threat of encroachment of Clann Ruaidhr√≠ power into what he regarded as his own domain.Daniels (2013) p. 28. Despite this dramatic removal of William III's main rival, the most immediate beneficiary of the killing was E√≥in,Brown, M (2004) p. 271; Duncan (1998) p. 268. a man who was also William III's brother- in-law.Caldwell, D (2008) pp. 52‚Äì53; Duncan (1998) p. 268.

Although the latter appears to have been either dead or divorced from E√≥in by 1350, the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ territories evidently remained in Clann Domhnaill possession after E√≥in's subsequent marriage to Margaret, daughter of Robert Stewart, Steward of Scotland.Proctor (2006); Boardman, SI (2004); Oram (2004) p. 124; Munro (1981) p. 24; Bliss (1897) p. 381; Theiner (1864) p. 294 ¬ß 588. David himself died in 1371, and was succeeded by his uncle, Robert Stewart (as Robert II).Boardman, SI (2006).

A view down the spine of Glen Tilt, a region that appears to have been granted to a member of Clann Ruaidhr√≠. Although severely diminished, there is evidence indicating that Clann Ruaidhr√≠ continued on for several generations. Members of the family were noted gallowglasses in Ireland at about this time. One such man, the gallowglass commander of Toirdhealbhach √ì Conchobhair, King of Connacht was notably slain in 1342.Annals of the Four Masters (2013a) ¬ß 1342.2; Annals of the Four Masters (2013b) ¬ß 1342.2; Ann√°la Connacht (2011a) ¬ß 1342.3; Ann√°la Connacht (2011b) ¬ß 1342.3; Nicholls (2007) p. 89; Annala Uladh (2005) ¬ß 1339.2; McLeod (2005) p. 46; Annala Uladh (2003) ¬ß 1339.2; Roberts (1999) p. 8; Boardman, S (1996a) p. 9; AU 1339 (n.d.); Mac Ruaidhri (n.d.a); Raid Resulting from Political Encounter (n.d.); The Annals of Connacht, p. 287 (n.d.). The annal-entries noting this man are the last sources to specifically note Clann Ruaidhr√≠ gallowglasses in Ireland.Nicholls (2007) p. 89. Nevertheless, there is reason to suspect that a certain E√≥ghan‚Äîgranted the thanage of Glen Tilt by Robert Stewart at some point before 1346‚Äîwas an Irish- based brother of Raghnall and √Åine,Boardman, SI (2004); Brown, M (2004) p. 333; Roberts (1999) p. 6; Grant (1998) p. 79; Boardman, S (1996a) pp. 9, 26 n. 46; Boardman, S (1996b) pp. 7, 28 n. 31; Atholl (1908) pp. 26‚Äì27. brought back to Scotland to serve the military forces of the expanding Steward.Roberts (1999) p. 10; Boardman, S (1996a) p. 9; Boardman, S (1996b) p. 7. As in Scotland,MacGregor, M (2000) p. 145 n. 93. it seems that the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ ruling line dwindled and faded away in Ireland in the fourteenth century. Even so, the fact that the family continued into later centuries appears to be evidenced by the fifteenth-century executions of Alasdair Mac Ruaidhr√≠ and E√≥in Mac Artair, chieftains said to have commanded one thousand men apiece.Boardman, S (2006) p. 126; Boardman, SI (2005) p. 133; Campbell of Airds (2004) p. 142; Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 114‚Äì116, 226; Brown, MH (1991) pp. 290‚Äì291; Watt (1987) p. 261; Origines Parochiales Scotiae (1854) p. 201; Turnbull (1842) p. 232; Goodall (1759) p. 489 bk. 16 ch. 15; Hearnius (1722) pp. 1283‚Äì1284. The attempt by Cairist√≠ona to divert the Clann Ruaidhr√≠ lordship into the hands of Art√∫r Caimb√©al, almost a century before, could indicate that Alasdair Mac Ruaidhr√≠ and E√≥in Mac Artair had continued a feud that stemmed from Cairist√≠ona's contested inheritance and her connections with the Caimb√©alaigh.Boardman, S (2006) pp. 126, 137 n. 53; Campbell of Airds (2004) p. 142; Campbell of Airds (2000) pp. 114‚Äì116, 226.

The fact that Ruaidhr√≠ Mac N√©ill seems to be the first member of Clann N√©ill to have borne a name alluding to Clann Ruaidhr√≠, coupled with the fact that Giolla Adhamhn√°in is known to have held Barra and Boisdale‚Äîinsular territories formerly controlled by Clann Ruaidhr√≠‚Äîcould indicate that Clann N√©ill's right to these lands came through a line of descent from a Clann Ruaidhr√≠ heiress.Holden; Boardman; McNeill et al.

Du Toits Peak is the highest mountain at . History The pass was named after Francois Du Toit, a 17th- century Huguenot pioneer who settled in the foothills. Prior to 1825, farmers used the pass to get to the interior beyond. At that time, Lieutenant Schonfelt of the farm Du Toitskloof asked the Cape Colony government for money for a road through the pass but no funds were provided. Another pass became the better route and in 1845, the route over the Bainskloof Pass was constructed, named after engineer Andrew Geddes Bain. In 1930, engineer P.A. de Villiers explored the idea of a road over the pass and in 1938 it was investigated further by the National Roads Board with the route finalised in 1940. The project was started in the summer of 1941/42. It cost R1.25 million and was 40km long with the road opened in March 1949 by Prime Minister DF Malan.

Art in the Caribbean reflects thousands of years of habitation by Arawak, Kalinago, and other people of the Caribbean followed by waves of immigration, which included artists of European origins and subsequently by artists with heritage from countries all around the world (including countries in the African continent). The nature of Caribbean art reflects these diverse origins, as artists have taken their traditions and adapted these influences to reflect the reality of their lives in the Caribbean. The governments of the Caribbean have at times played a central role in the development of Caribbean culture. However, some scholars and artists challenge this governmental role. Historically and in later times artists have combined British, French, Spanish, Dutch and African artistic traditions, at times embracing European styles and at other times working to promote nationalism by developing distinctly Caribbean styles. Caribbean art remains the combination of these various influences. Early influences The first immigrants (said to be originally from the Orinoco basin) to the Caribbean region were the Ta√≠no (those found throughout much of the Greater and Lesser Antilles), and the Arawak (those found in South America and part of Trinidad). These early Caribbeans are supposed to have occupied the region since 2000BC. In Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles, the Ta√≠no-Arawak art has been found in stone carvings, figurines (which are essentially curvilinear) and pottery dating from the period before European contact and are said to be as old as twenty- four hundred years. These few discovered artifacts, preserved in museum collections, have contributed new culturally hybrid art forms. Not until the 1950s and 1960s did a small number of Caribbean artists began to renew and in some cases re-invent indigenous art forms. Currently there are no indigenous artists practicing in any media in the Caribbean. Art in the colonial period (from 1496) T. de Bry - 1594 The settlement in the Caribbean islands began by the Spanish on the island of Hispaniola as early as 1496. They then settled on Puerto Rico followed by Cuba. They did not colonise Trinidad until 1592. It is extremely unlikely that the Ta√≠no-Arawak people had any input to the spaniade artistic developments since it has been estimated that their population was quickly depleted from 200,000 to as little as 500. Map of New France made by Samuel de Champlain in 1612. French settlers arrived in the Caribbean in the 1625 and established trading ports on the islands of St. Kitts, Tortuga (in 1628, now a British Virgin Island) in Saint-Domingue (later Haiti), Martinique, and Guadeloupe (both in 1635). Near the end of the 17th century, the population of the French Caribbean was growing steadily but the territory was increasingly isolated from France because in 1674 the French trading company finally failed, and few artists had arrived from Europe. Currently little or no research has been done to highlight the early French influenced art forms originating in the Caribbean, nor to list artists who might fit within this category. Although Trinidad was never governed by the French, the islands original settlers, the Spanish, allowed planters from the French islands to settle and develop the country from about 1777. The effect of French occupation can be seen in the names of places and to a smaller extent in the laws of the country - so it is highly possible that art also may have early French influences. Turgoart (Haiti), Another Call From Africa, 2009 According to Jamaican art historian Petrine Archer, \\"there is sparse evidence of local art production in any of the islands prior to the 20th century\\" other than from the occasional visiting European. Haiti was a lone exception.  The Caribbean Artists Movement  A key movement that sprung from Caribbean Art was the Caribbean Artist Movement (Also known as CAM). The movement lasted for less than ten years while the founders of the movement were Eddie Brathwaite, John Larose, and Andrew Salkey. In 1966, CAM resulted from the works of Caribbean Art: artists, writers, poets, filmmakers, actors, and musicians that made an excursion to London England. The Caribbean Artist Movement was a new look into the arts that transferred ideas amongst Caribbean artists. This gave them a shared Caribbean ‚Äònationhood‚Äô which in turn allowed people to take pride in their new cultural achievements. CAM held many newsletters, conferences, and exhibitions to showcase the Caribbean Arts; however, many of these events were held to get recognition of Caribbean artists.  Contemporary trends in Caribbean art  Art made in the Caribbean by living Caribbean artists refers to a range of visual, media, performance, and other practices that are critically acclaimed. There has been much debate over whether a national style, philosophical outlook, or unified and cohesive culture exists or ever has existed within the Caribbean. Geographically it is large, with many distinct regions, and its population are diverse and made up of varying national and ethnic backgrounds. Also distinctions between \\"high art\\" and \\"popular\\" art seem to be becoming less clear, making the task of locating common characteristics of Caribbean art or culture increasingly difficult. Tumelo Mosaka, curator at the Brooklyn Museum (NY) suggests: Contemporary art in the Caribbean reflects an engagement with the region's cultural past. Archer describes recent trends as \\"a self-conscious and satirical embracing of cultural memory styled in unconventional settings, installations and off-the-wall works that straddle African traditions and European post-modern ideas of 'primitive' creativity.\\" It is an imagery and history which is yet to be resolved. There are moments when contemporary artists living and working in the Caribbean ‚Äî as individuals or groups ‚Äî for example Christopher Cozier (Trinidad & Tobago), Deborah Anzinger (Jamaica), Humberto Diaz and Wilfredo Prieto (Cuba), Jorge Pineda / Quintapata (Dominican Republic), LaVaughn Bell (St. Croix), Maksaens Denis (Haiti), Tirzo Martha (Curacao) and Tony Cruz (Puerto Rico) to name a few have distinguished themselves through international recognition, collaboration, or \\"the spirit of the times\\".

Biography  Roman Mashkov was born on September 24, 1922, to a Russian peasant family in Bolshiye Goly, a village in the Kachugsky Municipal District of the Irkutsk region of Russia. After completing seven years of school, he went to work on a collective farm. In October 1941, he joined the Red Army, serving in its airborne troops, and in April 1942, he arrived in I operate army. He served as the commander of an intelligence platoon in the 2nd Baltic Front, a major formation of the Red Army, where he caused a stir in fights on Latvia's clearing. On August 21, 1944, under the command of Major Dityuk, Mashkov was deployed in a mechanized infantry battalion that carried out an attack on the railway station ƒírgƒºi in the Madona Municipality of Latvia, now the ƒírgƒºi municipality. On August 22, the battalion appeared to cut off from the brigade's main forces. As the platoon fought to hold its defenses, Lieutenant Mashkov commanded eight soldiers to beat off the enemy attacks, which killed ten German soldiers. During the attack, Mashkov fired from a mounted machine gun. After that, the group was successfully forwarded through the lake on which another coast has incorporated into the armies. Mashkov supplied information on the deployment and location of German soldiers and artillery. Later, Mashkov was in charge of several prospecting sorties. In one of them, Mashkov found out a staff of a German division. Having collected a group of scouts, it had made a touch on a team. As a result, Moshkov not only seized enemy documents but also killed the commander of an enemy division. Moshkov played an essential role in preparing an exit strategy for the battalion and accepting the correct decision on the enemy defense break. He delivered the prospecting data about weapon emplacements of the opponent to the commander of a battalion. For these accomplishments, Moshkov was awarded the rank of Hero of the Soviet Union. He was wounded four times throughout the war, however, he returned to the front lines after every treatment. Roman Mashkov was present on Russian Victory Day in Berlin. After World War II, Moshkov was transferred to the reserve, and he worked on his native collective farm, the \\"Second Pyatiletka.\\" After retirement, Moshkov moved to Novokhopyorsk in Voronezh Oblast, where he died on July 22, 1971. By Lenin's order, Moshkov was awarded the Gold Star medal (‚Ññ 8936) and other medals. Leonid Sandalov's 1965 book, The Difficult Boundaries, (Russian: –¢—Ä—É–¥–Ω—ã–µ —Ä—É–±–µ–∂–∏), identifies Roman Mashkov as a hero. The memorial bust of the Novel of Moshkov can be found in the central memorial devoted to a victory in World War II in the city of Novokhopyorsk.

Records of California Men In The War of the Rebellion 1861 to 1867, California Adjutant-General's Office, 1890 Pgs. 763-795 Service At Tubac and Fort Mason In the Spring of 1865, the Regimental Headquarters and Companies D, E, and G were assigned to Tubac, Arizona Territory. Though they were there primarily to operate against the Apaches, they were also assigned the job of reinforcing the International Line against potential incursions by the forces of the Mexican Empire and its French allies. As part of the ongoing war of the French Intervention, Imperialist forces had made recent advances into the neighboring Mexican State of Sonora, causing considerable alarm among officials in the United States. In September, the garrison was moved south to Calabazas, a small settlement near the border where they established a post called Post at Calabasas, later renamed Fort Mason. They were joined there by the 1st Battalion of Native Cavalry, California Volunteers. Shortly afterward, Sonora Governor Ignacio Pesqueira, who had fled northward after his army had been destroyed in a series of battles with the Imperialists, arrived at the post with a small party seeking refuge. Colonel Lewis put the post, his officers, and his men at the Governor's disposal. Service at Fort Mason was generally considered miserable. Because of its somewhat swampy (by Arizona standards) location on the banks of the Santa Cruz River, the men suffered from an epidemic which at one point rendered over half of them too sick for duty and led to at least 25 deaths. The post suffered from supply problems as well. These conditions caused construction of permanent buildings at the post to slow to a halt, leaving the men to live in tents and temporary brush shelters during their service there and generally curtailing operations against the Apaches. Participation in one campaign against the Apaches, for instance, was aborted by a lack of adequate shoes. Despite this, the Seventh was, from time to time, able to put small expeditions into the field. On one such occasion, Captain Hiram A. Messenger led a scouting party of 15 men into the Huachuca Mountains in July, 1865. The detachment found itself surrounded and under attack by a reported 100 or 200 Apaches and escaped after a fortuitous rainstorm ended a fight that lasted over an hour and left two soldiers dead and one wounded.Hunt. Pgs. 143-144 The Regiment was ordered back to The Presidio in March, 1866 and was mustered out the following April and May.

Originally formed in 1912 as a Militia formation, the brigade was re-raised in 1916 as part of the expansion of the Australian Imperial Force following the end of the Gallipoli campaign. It subsequently saw service on the Western Front in France and Belgium during the First World War. After the war it was disbanded but was re-raised in 1921 as a part-time formation based in the state of Victoria. During the Second World War the brigade was used in a garrison role in Australia before being disbanded in 1942. History The 10th Brigade traces its origins to 1912, when it was formed as a Militia brigade as part of the introduction of the compulsory training scheme, assigned to the 2nd Military District. At this time, the brigade's constituent units were located around New South Wales including Bulli, Wollongong, Nowra, Rockdale, Kogarah, Ashfield, Canterbury, Burwood and Rookwood. First World War The 10th Brigade was re-formed in 1916 as an Australian Imperial Force (AIF) formation for service during the First World War. Assigned to the 3rd Division, upon formation it consisted of four battalions‚Äîthe 37th, 38th, 39th and 40th Battalions‚Äîwhich were raised in Victoria and Tasmania. In July 1916, the brigade sailed to England where it undertook further training before being committed to the fighting on the Western Front in late 1916. A period of acclimatization followed in a \\"nursery sector\\" around Armenti√®res where the newly arrived troops undertook patrols into No Man's Land and minor raids on the German trenches opposite them during the winter months. In early 1917, the brigade moved to the Messines‚ÄìWytschaete Ridge section of the front line in Belgium, where they began to prepare to take part in their first major battle of the war. Throughout the year, the brigade took part in the fighting at Messines in June, the Battle of Broodseinde in early October and then later the Battle of Passchendaele also in October. In early 1918, the collapse of the Russian resistance on the Eastern Front enabled the Germans to transfer a large number of troops to the west, and the Germans subsequently launched their Spring Offensive. The offensive was initially successful in pushing the Allies back towards Amiens and the 10th Brigade's battalions, which had remained around Armenti√®res throughout the winter, were hastily committed to a defensive role. In late March, the brigade fought a defensive actions around Dernancourt and Morlancourt. On 13 July, the brigade captured Merris. The offensive was eventually halted and afterwards, in August, the Allies launched their Hundred Days offensive. The brigade was subsequently committed to the Allied advance through the Somme Valley, taking part in actions at Proyart, Bray and Clery. Shortly before the end of the war, due to heavy casualties amongst the AIF in 1918, the brigade's establishment was reduced to three infantry battalions as one‚Äîthe 37th‚Äîwas disbanded in September in order to reinforce the other battalions. This was due to widespread manpower shortages in the AIF as a result of the high number of casualties suffered during the Hundred Days Offensive. Inter-war years and the Second World War  Following the end of the war, the 10th Brigade was disbanded; however, in 1921 it was re-raised as part of the Militia after it was decided to perpetuate the designations and battle honours of the AIF by reorganising Australia's part- time military force. Assigned to the 3rd Division again, at this time, the brigade was based in Melbourne and regional Victoria within the 3rd Military District and consisted of four infantry battalions: the 24th, 37th, 39th and 48th. The 48th Battalion was subsequently re-designated as the 52nd Battalion, and a new 48th Battalion re-raised in South Australia. On 1 May 1926, Thomas Blamey became commander of the brigade, remaining in the position until he took over the 3rd Division on 23 March 1931. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War, the brigade was based in Victoria in September 1939, and assigned to the 3rd Division. On 8 December 1941, the brigade was mobilised for full- time duty as the Militia was called up for garrison and defensive duties following Japan's entry into the war. Forming part of the Army's reserve element, it was based at Nagambie Road, near Seymour, Victoria. As part of the mobilisation process, the brigade was reorganised into a brigade-group formation with organic artillery, anti-tank and engineer support. Its establishment was also reduced from four infantry battalions to three as the Australian Army moved towards the British Army brigade structure. In March 1942, the brigade moved to Bonegilla, Victoria, for further training before moving to Queensland to defend the area around Beaudesert. In July, the brigade moved again, this time to Oakhurst, as the 3rd Division began to move to Maryborough, where it would concentrate as part of II Corps. In September 1942, the 10th Brigade was disbanded‚Äîhaving not seen active service‚Äîas part of the reallocation of manpower resources that occurred within the Australian Army at that time. During the war, the 10th Brigade's subordinate units included: the 37th, 52nd, 24th/39th and 24th Battalions, as well as the 2nd Field Regiment, Royal Australian Artillery, the 10th Field Company, Royal Australian Engineers and the 23rd Anti-Tank Battery, Royal Australian Artillery.

Formed in 1912 as a Militia formation, it was later re-raised in 1916 as part of the all volunteer First Australian Imperial Force that was raised for overseas service during the First World War. The brigade was part of the 4th Division and fought on the Western Front until the end of the war in November 1918. During the inter-war years, the brigade was re-formed in Australia as a part-time unit; during the Second World War, it was mobilised for full-time service, but did not serve overseas, undertaking garrison duties in Australia until 1945 when it was used to raise Timor Force. History The 12th Brigade traces its origins to 1912, when it was formed as a Militia brigade as part of the introduction of the compulsory training scheme, assigned to the 3rd Military District. At this time, the brigade's constituent units were located at various locations throughout Victoria, including Oakleigh, Sale, Caulfield, Balaclava, Brighton, Toorak, Armadale, Auburn and Camberwell. During World War I, the 12th Brigade was re-raised in early 1916 as part of the expansion of the all volunteer First Australian Imperial Force. The brigade was formed in Egypt from a cadre of experienced personnel who had served during the Gallipoli Campaign as part of the 4th Brigade. Attached to the 4th Division and consisting of four infantry battalions‚Äîthe 45th, 46th, 47th and 48th Battalions‚Äîit served in the trenches of the Western Front from June 1916 onwards. During this time, the brigade fought in several significant battles including the Battle of Pozi√®res, the First Battle of Bullecourt, the Battle of Messines, the Battle of Passchendaele, and the German Spring Offensive. During the German Spring Offensive, the brigade fought a defensive action around Dernancourt. In May 1918, the brigade was one of three that was selected to disband one of its battalions in order to provide reinforcements to other units in the Australian Corps and it was at this time that the 47th Battalion was disbanded. The 12th Brigade's remaining battalions continued to fight after this, taking part in the final Allied offensive of the war, the Hundred Days Offensive, which was launched around Amiens in August and followed by a series of advances as the Allies broke through the Hindenburg Line. Following the end of hostilities, the brigade was disbanded in early 1919 as part of the demobilisation of the AIF. In 1921, the Australian government decided to reorganise the nation's part-time military forces in order to replicate the numerical designations and structure of the AIF. As a result, the 12th Brigade was re-raised at this time as part of the 6th Military District in Tasmania as a unit of the Citizens Force. Headquartered Hobart, the brigade consisted of the 12th, 40th, 51st, and 52nd Infantry Battalions, and the 22nd Light Horse Regiment. In 1924, the 12th Brigade was reorganised as the 12th Mixed Brigade, consisting of several infantry, artillery, engineer and light horse units. However, by 1928, the brigade consisted of only two infantry battalions: the 12th and 40th. Initially, the Citizens Forces units were maintained by a mixture of voluntary and compulsory service, but in 1929, the compulsory training scheme was suspended and the Citizens Force was re-formed as the \\"Militia\\", staffed on an all volunteer basis. Upon the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939, the brigade was stationed in Tasmania, where it served in a garrison role. At this time it consisted of two infantry battalions, an artillery regiment, an engineer field company and a light horse regiment. The brigade was mobilised for full time defensive service in December 1941, and was initially assigned to the defence of Hobart. By early 1943, the threat of invasion in the area had passed and the brigade was transferred to Yorkforce around Townsville, Queensland. The brigade was assigned to the 4th Division between April and June 1943, and then assigned to the Northern Territory Force, where it replaced the 23rd Brigade and served in a defensive capacity around Darwin. During this time the brigade's establishment was reduced from four battalions to three; however, the brigade's establishment changed a number of times. The following units were attached to the brigade at various times during the war: 22nd Light Horse, 40th Battalion, 12th/50th Battalion, 22nd Motor Regiment, 36th Battalion, 55th/53rd Battalion, 38th Battalion, 10th/48th Battalion, 12th/40th Battalion. As the war progressed, the size of the Darwin garrison was greatly reduced as other formations were disbanded or transferred to take part in combat operations in the Pacific. At war's end in August 1945, the 12th Brigade was used to form Timor Force, accepting the Japanese surrender.

The area traditionally belonged to the Styria region and is now included in the Mura Statistical Region.Ljutomer municipal site Name Cven was attested in written sources in 1445 as Wyenn and circa 1500 as Wienn. The Slovene name Cven is borrowed from the Middle High German prepositional phrase ze Wienn, literally 'at Wienn'. The name Wienn refers to a manor built in the 14th century by a military commander named Aman. It may be derived from the Middle High German noun win 'acquisition'.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1980.

For similar Slovene geographical names based on foreign-language prepositional phrases of location, compare Cmurek, Crngrob, Dragonja, Sostro, and Spuhlja. History Potsherds and human remains from antiquity have been found in the settlement, testifying to early settlement in the area. The village was sacked during a peasant uprising in 1704, and the castle was also burned and never rebuilt. Cven Castle was surrounded by a meander in the Murica River on three sides and protected by a moat on the fourth side. Cven was known for horse breeding from the mid-19th century until the Second World War. Horse races were held as early as 1850 along the road from Ljutomer to Kri≈æevci pri Ljutomeru, and a horse racing society was established in 1875, which also set up a racetrack in Cven. A school was established in the village in 1879, and a fire station was built in 1892. Cultural heritage There is a small chapel with a belfry in the centre of the village.

The park is developed and run by Malabar Tourism Development Co-operative Limited (MTDC). It is situated near to the famous Muthappan temple in Parassinikadavu. It was officially inaugurated in August 2008 and since then it has become one of the favorite holiday destination in Malabar. The park is completely operated by the rain water collected by the reservoir spread over of land with a capacity of of water. Developments and the future Malabar Tourism Development Cooperative Limited (MTDC) was registered on 15 February 2000. And one month later on 9 March 2000 kick-started its operations with E.P.Jayarajan as the Chairman. The job sector of Malabar, mainly Kannur focused on textile industry especially handloom, khadi and other industries such as beedi, pottery etc. an integral part of conventional occupation of the region. But all these occupations faced many challenges which gradually lead to an economic decline. In such scenario, to meet the growing market and to create more job opportunities in addition to catering to the growing tourism industry, MTDC came into existence. The main objects of MTDC are to promote, establish, maintain and manage the business related to tourism and hospitality industry by setting up establishment such as: * Amusement park, museum. * Tour operations for foreign and domestic tourists. * Hotels, restaurants, cool bars, ice cream stall, motels etc. * Shops for selling handicrafts, curious etc. * Water sports and river cruises. * Hill and beach resorts with all modern facilities to attract foreign and domestic tourists, etc. Vismaya park is one of the first projects started by MTDC.

The Danubian Principalities Sporadic antisemitic legislation existed in Wallachia and Moldavia, the predecessors of the Romanian state, since the settlement of Jews in the area. As a non-Christian people coming mostly from the Ottoman Empire (almost all Jews in Wallachia were Sephardi at the time), their allegiance was considered dubious. Nevertheless, their community was usually given a large amount of autonomy.Radu Ioanid, The Holocaust in Romania: \\"The Legal Status of the Jews in Romania\\", at the Romanian Jewish Community The Russian-imposed quasi-constitutional document Regulamentul Organic demanded Jews to register with the local authority, specifying their occupation, so that the Jews who \\"cannot demonstrate their usefulness\\" could be identified and expelled. During the Wallachian Revolution of 1848, the Proclamation of Islaz demanded the emancipation of the Jews, but the eventual defeat of the revolution meant that its clauses were not applied. Pre-WWI Kingdom of Romania  Citizenship  When Romania was formed by the union of Wallachia and Moldavia, Jewish residents did not become citizens of the new state. Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza announced in 1865 a project which would lead to the \\"gradual emancipation of the people of Mosaic faith\\", however, all the plans were canceled as Cuza was deposed the following year.Hitchins, p. 165 After Cuza was deposed, Article 7 of the 1866 Constitution of Romania did not allow non-Christians to become citizens of the United Principalities of Romania,Hitchins, p. 16 so Jews could not become citizens unless they converted to Christianity. The change in outlook can be explained by the weakening of the liberalism which led to the 1848 Revolution and its replacement with nationalism. As a result of the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878), Romania gained its independence and at the Congress of Berlin of 1878, the nations of Europe recognized it, with the condition of making all citizens, regardless of ethnic origin or religious beliefs, equal under law. In 1879, the Parliament of Romania grudgingly removed the constitution article which barred Jews from becoming citizens. However naturalization was still a cumbersome process requiring a personal petition and the approval of the Parliament on individual cases. The result was that very few Jews were naturalized: between 1866 and 1904, only 2000 people of Jewish faith were naturalized, of which 888 were granted citizenship for their participation in the Russo-Turkish War.  Economic discrimination  The Prince and later King of Romania, Carol I was an antisemite and the Liberal Interior Minister Ion BrƒÉtianu began some tightening of policies against Jews. In 1867 he demanded the prefects to enforce the regulations about the \\"Jewish vagabonds\\" and therefore stop the Jewish immigration into Romania and prevent their settlement into villages. One year later, the Chamber of Deputies received a draft law project that would attempt to eliminate the Jews from economic activity in the villages. The policies of the other major party, the Conservative Party, regarding the Jews were similar to the one of the Liberals. For instance, in 1873, the LascƒÉr Catargiu government introduced a law regarding the sale of alcoholic beverages which tried to remove the near- monopoly Jews had on these products. The Jews of Romania protested against the economic and political discrimination they faced and gained support from Western European Jewish organizations such as the Paris-based Alliance Isra√©lite Universelle, which attempted to put pressure on Romania with the help of sympathetic politicians. Romanian legislation generally discriminated against the people who were not citizens of Romania (such as were most Jews) and as such, Jews were not allowed to hold certain offices.Hitchins, p. 165-166 Interwar Romania Antonescu government See also *History of the Jews in Romania Notes References *Radu Ioanid, The Holocaust in Romania: The Destruction of Jews and Gypsies Under the Antonescu Regime, 1940-1944, * Category:Jewish Romanian history Category:Antisemitism in Romania Category:Legal history of Romania ","title":"Antisemitic laws in Romania"},{"id":"25032719","text":"Bodislavci () is a settlement in the Slovene Hills () in the Municipality of Ljutomer, Slovenia.

Main characters Kiyosumi High School The main characters start out as students at Kiyosumi High School. ; : :Portrayed by: Minami Hamabe :Saki Miyanaga is a first-year student and is the titular character of the story. When originally discovered by Kiyosumi's club, she was notorious for her ability to finish plus/minus 0, essentially finishing with the same score she started with (+/- 400 points). This came out of playing with her family when she was younger, \\"I would not get any candy if I lose, but they will get angry if I win too many.\\" as stated by Saki. Eventually, she joins the club so that she can reach the Inter-highs and see her sister, Teru Miyanaga, who by this time has become a top-ranked professional mahjong player. :Saki's ability once she goes for the Inter-Highs is rinshan kaih≈ç, or winning off of a tile taken from the dead wall after calling kan. It can even go to the extent that she can call multiple kans off of the dead well en route to the win. It is because of this ability that Hisa places Saki into the captaincy position (5th player). Moreover, because of her performance in the Nagano prefecturals and the eventual defeat of Amae Koromo, people begin considering her as one of the feared national-class monsters. Her presence when performing her ability can either take the form of white provincial flowers appearing behind her in the background with several petals swirling around (this is in reference to her name which literally translated means \\"a flower blooms on a ridge\\"), or her left eye flashing with yellow or red light in a lightning formation or forming flame-like arrays and her playing hand engulfed in yellow flames or static. :It has been noted though after the quarterfinals where Kiyosumi and Himematsu advance, that not only has Saki been using her rinshan kaiho ability, but that in fact she has continued to use her plus/minus 0 ability even in tournament play. The difference in the quarterfinals is that instead of insuring that she just finishes plus/minus 0, she manipulates everyone else's score such that she winds up being the winner. :Outside of using her abilities, her gameplay tends to be rather quiet. However, she appears to get a handle on the flow of any particular game, thus allowing her to make use of her ability. She placed third in the Nagano Prefectural Individual Tournament. :Saki and Nodoka's relationship initially gets off to a shaky footing; however, eventually they become very close to the point where they frequently hold hands to draw strength from each other. In general, she is very shy, an avid bookworm, and has a terrible sense of direction (leading her to get lost easily, particularly in tournaments). Her goal is to reach the national tournament and face her sister in a mahjong match, in the hopes that even though her sister has stopped talking to her, she can communicate to her through mahjong, and they can reconcile. :In the Nationals, she is hailed as one of the first year monsters alongside Awai. ; : :Portrayed by: Nana Asakawa :Nodoka Haramura is a first-year, who was the previous year's National Middle School Individual Champion and plays the vice- captain position (4th) on the team. She first learned how to play mahjong during 4th grade while staying in a hospital. Unlike many of the national- class monsters, Nodoka does not have an innate ability that is hand related (such as Saki's rinshan, or Amae's haitei). Instead, she draws upon her online mahjong abilities in her gameplay. :Due to having so few people to play with, Nodoka turned to online mahjong. Known as \\"Nodocchi\\" („ÅÆ„Å©„Å£„Å°), she developed into one of the better online players (much to Touka's chagrin). She transfers her online abilities to live play as seen from her quick draws and discards. In addition, due to Hisa's recommendation she carries her stuffed penguin Etopen to help settle her down while playing in tournaments helping her reach her heightened state. That state, known as \\"Nodocchi mode\\", manifests itself as her online avatar dressed in white with a halo and white wings. In this state, she can view the board on a digital level thus negating abilities like Momoko's stealth mode. In addition, her hands come together much faster making it hard for her opponents to build their own hands as well as sense Nodoka's hands. She was the runner up of the Nagano Prefectural Individual Tournament. :Outside of gameplay, Nodoka's personality is that of a \\"proper lady\\" as noted by Mako Someya though she still carries Etopen around and sleeps with it. She considers herself very rational, to the point where she still considers Saki's rinshan ability, and earlier Kuro's dora ability to be mere coincidence. A continual running gag is that she is very self-conscious about her breasts, especially around Saki and Yuuki. :Nodoka hopes to win the tournament, so that her father, who dislikes her playing mahjong, will allow her to stay at her current school. ; : :Portrayed by: Aika Hirota :Yuuki Kataoka is a first year student at Kiyosumi High School and plays the vanguard (1st) position. Her main ability is to be very strong in the East wind of every game, often jumping out to huge leads against her opponents. She can supplement this with what she refers to as \\"taco power\\" by eating her favorite food, tacos - or in a pinch eating something with taco in the word such as takoyaki („Åü„Åì„ÇÑ„Åç) which can partially increase her ability. However, since competition games are hanchans (East and South winds), she often struggles in the south wind usually giving back most if not all of her gains. :Her mannerism at the table tends to match her childish personality, such as wearing a cape to the table during the Inter-highs and declaring she'd end the game in the first round. It can also lead her to be rather slow at realizing things, such as when Mihoko was leading her on during the prefectural final. She placed 14th in the final Nagano Prefectural Individual Tournament. :Yuuki and Nodoka first met back in Takatoobara Middle, eventually choosing to go to Kiyosumi simply because the cafeteria sells tacos. She tends to treat Kyoutarou as an errand boy, getting tacos for her or having him carry the luggage amongst other things. Despite this, she does get jealous when he looks at Nodoka or Mihoko and becomes even more self-conscious about her flat chest in comparison. :Even though she is childish in nature, she is very protective of her friends as shown when she vows to win the Inter-highs after the media states that Kiyosumi is from a weak prefecture. :On the semi-finals match against Himematsu, Rinkai and Usuzan, Yuuki changed her playstyle from high-scoring hands into cheap quick- winning hands with the intention of getting a parenchan. Her changed playstyle led to the despair of Suzu and also led Satoha to determine to utterly crush her. :Her switch of playing style was ordered by Hisa to prepare Yuuki from facing Teru with fast hands. Since Yuuki's style is increasing her points with dora tiles, Hisa also told her to get used to play fast hands with little to no dora tiles to prepare her from Kuro's dora-hoarding. ; : :Portrayed by: Seika Furuhata :Hisa Takei is a third year student at Kiyosumi High School, and plays the lieutenant (3rd) position on the team. She is the president of the mahjong club, as well as the student council president. Her history is a bit shady as when she was younger, she went by the name of Hisa Ueno and during a tournament (in which she played with Mihoko), she mysteriously withdrew despite being near the top of the leaderboard. :Now in high school, she brings back the mahjong club at Kiyosumi in the hopes of participating in the Inter-highs though it would not be until her senior year that they would be able to compete as a team (she never wanted to participate in the individuals because she wanted to participate with others). She placed 4th in the Nagano Prefectural Individual Tournament :Hisa's ability is to win on what are termed \\"hell waits\\" - waits with those with just one tile to win (for instance like the 8-pin on a 7-9 inside wait), or those with just one tile left (if for instance in that same 8-pin wait 3 have already been discarded). This ability can intimidate opponents so much that she can use it to her advantage, tricking others to play into her hand, or in one case declaring an empty riichi (a ready hand with no winning tiles available as they have been called or discarded) so as to force an exhaustive draw. :Despite having an ability that would seem to suggest inefficient play, she is still very strategic in nature as shown when she went toe-to-toe with Mihoko in the prefectural individual tournament. :Outside of the table, Hisa exhibits great leadership skills over her team as well as organizing events and communicating with other schools in the prefecture. In addition, she's very caring towards not just her teammates, but for other players as well (such as Mihoko). This may lead her to make the statement that there is a meaning to each tile you grab. ; : :Portrayed by: Anna Yamada :Mako Someya is a second year student at Kiyosumi High School and plays the sergeant (2nd) position. Mako was introduced to mahjong at an early age as her grandfather owned a mahjong parlor and she regularly visited there (she now works there as a waitress). As a result of this, she picks up her peculiar speech manner and more importantly her special ability; she also received her glasses from him. Nicknamed \\"Spindle Territory\\", it allows her to memorize games she has seen or played in so as to be able to recall them in similar situations. She utilizes this when she takes her glasses off. However, this technique fails when playing against Kaori Senoo as her beginner playing style goes against all her prior experiences. :Mako winds up being the first person that Hisa recruits for the mahjong club and as such becomes someone that she can rely upon, often being the only person that she shares her concerns to (though in daily interactions, she is often snarky when having conversations with her). She placed 15th in the final Nagano Prefectural Individual Tournament. Her favorite hand is ryuuiisou. :She's very good against players who use an orthodox playing style as seen when she curbstomped Aislynn. However, Hao's playing style is very different that it's very hard for Mako to counter against Hao. ; : :Kyoutarou Suga is a first year student at Kiyosumi High School. He was a classmate of Saki's back in middle school and is the one responsible for bringing her to the Kiyosumi mahjong club. :Despite being the only male in Kiyosumi's mahjong club, his skills are so poor that he winds up getting minimal attention most of the time and becomes the errand-boy fetching tacos for Yuuki or carrying the luggage of the team. His interest in both Nodoka and Mihoko, combined with his teasing of Yuuki often gets him into trouble - mostly with Yuuki. :Later in the series, he trains with Hagiyoshi to improve his taco making skills for Yuuki. He also is found to have a pet capybara that is featured in Yuuki's miniseries at the beginning and end of each Saki manga volume. Achiga Girls Academy This is the featured school in the side story, Saki Achiga-hen episode of side-A. Achiga is located in a rural part of Nara as evidenced by landmarks such as Yoshino Station in the series. ; : :Played by: Hiyori Sakurada :Shizuno is a first year, plays the captain position, and is the main protagonist of the side-A story. Plays the Captain position. In sixth grade she befriends Nodoka Haramura and together they play in the school's mahjong club. Considered the club's third best player before Nodoka joined them, she had forgotten about mahjong until she stumbled upon Nodoka's national individual middle school victory. Because of this, she decides that she wants to go to the Inter-highs so that she can play against Nodoka once again, and thus reforms the mahjong club. Outside of the table, Shizuno is a high energy, athletic girl. She enjoys hanging out with her friends whenever possible and tries to have as much fun as she can. :While people are led to believe that Shizuno doesn't have any special ability, it is hinted in the semifinals that she indeed does have one. She supposedly used it at the end of the first hanchan to win off of (and thus stop) Shiraitodai's Oohoshi Awai during her dealership. The only clues about her ability is the depiction of her having summitted a large hill, and the reference in the mid-game break with Ako to \\"11 more games\\" remaining. It is strong enough that Koromo makes a point of warning Saki of it while they watch the semifinal match. :It is finally revealed in the last chapter that Shizuno's ability is related to the mountains she played in as a child. Kuro and Ako recall her exploring the mountains and always finding her way home while Shizuno goes on to explain that in her time spent in the mountains, her consciousness would become one with them. In the same sense that the walls in mahjong are also referred to as mountains (Â±±), Shizuno is able to explore the mahjong \\"mountains\\" to a deeper extent than her opponents. This doesn't necessarily result in a nullification of other player's abilities, but it can slow them down. :As shown in the 2nd half of the semifinal Shizuno affects her opponents as follows. Against Senriyama's Ryuuka, when she uses her final ability of Toki's lap power it's probable that Shizuno prevents Toki from seeing a path to a winning hand. Versus Shindouju's Himeko and her linked power with Mairu, while Himeko still achieved her counted yakuman she noticed that her hand was slower to come together and that her link with Mairu was almost lost. And most decisively, against Shiraitodai's Awai she completely shuts out her double-riichi ability by creating rolls that make a final wall so deep she in effect \\"gets lost\\". And in the final hand (again where the final wall is very deep), Shizuno shocks Awai by taking away her kan ura-dora stating that the dead wall \\"is no longer her territory\\". ; : :Played by: Momoka Ito :Ako is a first year and the younger sister of Nozomi Atarashi who played alongside Harue 10 years ago. Plays the Lieutenant position. She is an elementary-school friend of Shizuno Takakamo and Nodoka Haramura and was considered the second best player in the club. However, when the club was to be disbanded she decided to head off to Adamine Middle so she could continue playing mahjong (eventually for prefectural powerhouse Bansei). At Adamine, Ako was very successful as she managed to finish in the top 16 in the individual prefectural tournament. But when it came time to choose a high school, Shizuno's desire to reform the Achiga team compelled her to leave her teammates at Adamine and returns to Achiga. Like Shizuno, Ako has no special abilities, but according to nationals announcer Uta Mihirogi, she is Achiga's most skilled players but is overlooked because of the upperclassmen's special abilities. :Ako is much like Shizuno in that she wants to be with her friends as much as possible, but unlike Shizuno tends to be more rational and logical than her. ; : :Played by: Yuri Tsunematsu :Kuro is a second year and Yuu's younger sister. Plays the Vanguard position. Kuro was considered Achiga's number one player before it was disbanded. During the time the club was disbanded, she faithfully cleaned up the room in the hopes that the club would once again be revived. :Kuro's ability is to attract dora tiles during the game. This comes from the fact that her mother told her to cherish her dora, which led to her keeping them in her hand, and subsequently began collecting them more frequently. This eventually leads to her being nicknamed \\"The Dragon Lord\\". The problem with this ability is that should she ever discard a dora, she will be unable to draw one for several games thereafter. In addition, her ability is easy to identify and therefore becomes easier to play against and turn against her. :However in the national semifinals, in the final hand of her vanguard match, Kuro experiences a transformation. Recalling her memories of her sister and mom and how her friends left and returned, she realizes that people will leave her but that she'll be willing to wait for them no matter what. With that realization, she becomes willing to discard a dora knowing that even if it doesn't come back she'll still be waiting. Whether this transformation changes the timeframe of Kuro's dora \\"drought\\" when she discards one, or affects her abilities in general is as of now unknown. However, Kuro's willingness to discard a dora makes her play less predictable. ; : :Played by: Kome Watanabe :Yuu is a third year and the older sister of Kuro and becomes the fourth member to join Achiga's mahjong club at Kuro's request. Plays the Sergeant position. She had wanted to play with the others in the mahjong club before it was disbanded, but felt it was awkward because she was older. :Yuu is very sensitive to the cold, seen wearing coats, mufflers, gloves outside, while resorting to using kotatsus inside even on summer. This leads to her special ability which is to draw chun and manzu tiles as they represent warmth to her, due to their predominantly red color. Should that fail in a match, she draws any tile with red on it and becomes much harder to defend against. Incidentally, Toki considers her playing style similar to hers, despite their abilities being much different. ; : :Played by: Riko Nakayama :Arata is a second year and the final member recruited for the team. Plays the Vice- Captain position. She was a huge admirer of Harue when Harue was playing for Achiga, but resented her and stopped playing when Harue decided to teach mahjong at Achiga instead of playing professionally. However, her view changes when Harue returns from her corporate team and wants to help the team reach the Inter-High again. When playing she wears a tie that was given to her by Harue, and since her family runs a bowling alley she also wears a bowler's glove. Her main play style is very much influenced by bowling, especially with how she prefers waits using \\"pins\\" tiles. As Hiroko notes, the tiles she ends up waiting for look like well-known bowling splits/washouts one gets after the first roll in bowling - the two mentioned explicitly were the Greek Church (4-6-7-9-10) and the Cincinnati (7-9). However, this is not her only way of playing as Hiroko notes that she has another \\"outdated\\" style. She later realizes that her other style is inspired by how Harue played ten years prior. In addition, Arata plays with extra determination in the semifinals, as she plays in the same position as Harue who had lost 10 years prior. ; : :Played by: Nao Minamisawa :The coach of the Achiga team, Harue was part of Achiga's first appearance in the nationals before being defeated in the semi-finals by a team which consisted of current announcer Sukoya Kojaki. The loss was so devastating that she decided to head the mahjong club at Achiga for the elementary section of the school. Eventually with the help of Kumakura (who is now the coach at Miyamori Girls'), she lands a position playing for the Hakata Evergreens corporate team. But when the team is disbanded, Harue found herself drawn back to Achiga and upon discovering that the mahjong club was being started up again decided to become its coach. Nagano Prefectural Tournament Ry≈´monbuchi High School ; : :Portrayed by: Mai Kikuchi :Koromo is a second year student and plays captain for Ry≈´monbuchi. Despite being child-like in stature, she is considered one of the national-class monsters, and brought Kazekoshi's dominance to an end last year. Her special ability can prevent opponents from tenpai, but her primary ability is to win via haitei raoyue. This ability is further enhanced the close it is to a full moon. Winning in this manner tends to invoke despair in opponents as they appear helpless to stop the eventual win at the very end. :Koromo had lost both of her parents at a younger age, and despite being brought in by Touka mainly kept to herself. Touka tried to use mahjong as a tool to help her make friends, but because of her playing style she winds up being feared by many people - including her own teammates. As a result she only sees mahjong as a mere game for her to crush her opponent until Saki is able to befriend her by teaching her the fun of playing mahjong. Her birthday is September 6. :Koromo acts like a child despite being the oldest among the members of the team. She sleeps for 12 hours a day. ; : :Portrayed by: Mariya Nagao :Touka is a second year student who is the president of the club and plays the vice-captain position. The daughter of the principal and grand-daughter of the founder, her family is quite rich which is reflected in her personality using formal speech as well as drinking tea like a noblewoman. Despite her attitude, she can get wrapped up in activities such as ping-pong when she defeated everyone despite stating that she viewed it as a commoner's game. She once played a RTS game for 6 days straight just to get to top 100. :As part of the noblewoman persona, she tends to try and draw attention to herself while at the same time begrudging other who seem to draw attention to themselves. This manifests itself into an obsession with Nodoka who gets all the attention at the prefectural tournament as last year's individual champion. This is further exaggerated when Touka determines that Nodoka and the online avatar Nodocchi are the same person. But in contrast to her somewhat snobby attitude, Touka does care a lot for others taking in Hajime and Koromo Amae, as well as her reasons for entering the team tournament - though if anyone ever mentions it to her, she vehemently denies it. Her birthday is September 10. :Touka's playing style is similar to Nodoka in that she plays a fair amount of online mahjong. She uses a careful approach to obtain easily winnable hands. What differs is that she uses her emotions to ride the flow of the table when going up against strong opponents. However, Touka can enter what her friends call a \\"cold state\\" where she utilizes her flow control without the hindrance of emotion. This increases her ability so much that she can easily dominate very strong opponents like Saki, Koromo and even Fujita. The problem is that in this state she loses consciousness after a few games and cannot recall anything she did while in her cold state. ; : :Portrayed by: Kyoka Shibata :Hajime is a second year student, plays the lieutenant position and is a self- proclaimed maid to T≈çka. She is brought in by Touka as a second chance to play mahjong. This comes about as when she had played previously, she used her sleight-of-hand abilities to cheat during a tournament and thus had stopped playing. While Hajime took the offer, Touka chained her hands together (severely limiting her overall reach) in order to prevent her from using her sleight-of-hand. She is a maid in the Ryuumonbuchi Household. :Hajime for the most part is easy-going, though she does get a little jealous when T≈çka acts friendly towards other people. From her time when she was younger, she had worn a moon tattoo on her cheek though after playing against Koromo she took it off and now wears a star instead. Since being brought in by Touka, she now consider her mahjong team as a family. Her birthday is September 21. She placed 11 in the final Nagano Prefectural Individual Tournament. ; : :Portrayed by: Rie Kaneko :Tomoki is a second year student and plays the sergeant position. Tomoki has a developed figure, but dresses to cover her features and is seen most of the time on her subnotebook. She was a top ranked professional player at an RTS online video game before Touka recruited her to their mahjong team. Originally from a NEET from Hokkaido, Touka admired her skills in the RTS game and decided to recruit her into the Ryuumonbuchi Mahjong Team as the 5th player. She does not have any apparent special abilities. She placed 10th in the final Nagano Prefectural Individual Tournament. ; : :Portrayed by: Ena Koshino :Jun is a second year student and plays vanguard position. She has a tomboyish personality which is quite popular among girls and sometimes make fun of Koromo about her childish features, while other team members reciprocate by teasing her about her male- like traits often leading her to insist that she is in fact a woman. She is one of the closer members to Koromo Amae as she is almost always seen with her, though in her spare time, she is always seen eating. Her birthday is September 14. She is also a maid in the Ryuumonbuchi Household. :Jun has a heightened sense of the flow on the board, allowing her to change things into her favor including, but not limited to disabling the tiles her opponents collect. She placed seventh in the final Nagano Prefectural Individual Tournament ; : :Played by: Yuki Tamaki :Hagiyoshi is Touka Ryuumonbuchi's butler. Always calm and with a smile, he appears to be skilled at a wide variety of things such as sewing, cooking, as well as mahjong. His main trait though is to appear and disappear at the snap of Touka's fingers. In addition to his duties as a butler, he also tracks and escorts Koromo Amae when she is required for matches. :Later on it is revealed at the nationals that he and Kyoutarou met during the prefecturals while he was buying tacos. Hagiyoshi has since taught him how to make his own tacos. Kazekoshi Girls School A school noted to have a membership of over 80 students. The school had a strong history of winning the Nagano prefectural tournaments, until Ryuumonbuchi defeated them. ; : :Portrayed by: Mami Kamura :Mihoko is a third year student, captain of the Kazekoshi team, and plays the vanguard position. Though always called captain by her teammates, Mihoko plays vanguard/first-up and not the captain position. She has heterochromia and has her right eye closed most of the time. Being gentle towards everyone including her mahjong opponents, she is a perfect figure in her school and takes care of the house chores in the Kazekoshi mahjong club, thinking in doing so allows other members to practice with ease, which has the reverse effect of other members worrying about her instead. She manages to remember the names of all the members in the Mahjong Club, despite having around 100 members. Her favorite saying is \\"Anyone who tries has a chance.\\" Her mahjong playing ability comes when she opened her right eye, allowing her to calculate how the game progresses and predict opponent's hands with excellent accuracy, as well as a strong presence which disrupts the concentration of her opponents. Despite her abilities, she is useless with technology. The opponent that makes her most worried is Hisa Takei, the president of the Kiyosumi mahjong club. Hisa is Mihoko's old rival, back when she was known as Hisa Ueno. While Hisa had forgotten about her, they finally reminisce at the individuals tournament. Her presence manifests when she opens her right eye, triggering a blue crystal like background. While she fails to get progress to the nationals in the team tournament, she placed 1st in the Nagano Prefectural Individual Tournament, qualifying for the nationals along Saki and Nodoka. ; : :Portrayed by: Rena Takeda :Kana Ikeda is a second year student and plays the captain position. She has triplet sisters named Hina, Nazuna and Shirona who look exactly like her. She is very fond of her captain Mihoko. She was the only one in her year to get into Kazekoshi with a scholarship due to her achievements in middle school mahjong tournaments. Even though Kana is not the strongest player on their team, Mihoko entrusts the captain position to her so she can have another match-up against Koromo Amae and avenge their loss the previous year. Kana is very cat-like, sprouting ears and a tail at any given time, and she also purrs. Kana also appears in the Yuuki miniseries. Kana is a cheerful and has great confidence in her mahjong skill. Kana is shown to be very fond of Mihoko and loves to be petted by her. Kana has proclaimed that there is no-one who is more annoying than she is. She has also shown to be very stubborn. She placed 9th in the final Nagano Prefectural Individual Tournament. ; : :Portrayed by: Aya Yoshizaki :Miharu Yoshitome is a second year and plays the sergeant position. She is close with Kana and is given the nickname Miharun by her. She, like Yuuki tends to be sensitive about her flat-chest as evidenced when she saw Kaori entering the bath during the training camp. The incident exaggerates her implied rivalry with her which started in the prefectural tournament. She has far-sightedness and got glasses to be able to see mahjong tiles clearly. She placed 13th in the final Nagano Prefectural Individual Tournament. ; : :Portrayed by: Yuzu Higuchi :Seika Bundou is a first year student, and plays the lieutenant position. Previously ranked 78th in the club, she worked her way up to 5th before the tournament thus earning a spot on the team. Always seen with her eyes closed, Bundou tends to worry before and during her matches. However, after the prefectural tournament Bundou has been shown to have more confidence in herself, going so far as to say that her and Kazekoshi will be going to the nationals next year. One of her hobbies include collecting the mahjong stars series trading cards. ; : :Portrayed by: Mizuki Hoshina :Sumiyo Fukabori is a second year student, and plays the vice-captain position. She is a rather quiet individual and rarely talks outside of her matches. She is not shown doing much but standing in the background with her teammates. Sumiyo currently takes care of the Ikeda triplets with Seika Bundou, while their parents are at work and Kana Ikeda is away at the nationals. ; : :Played by: Hinako Sano :Takako Kubo is the coach of Kazekoshi Girls School. She initially is shown to have a rather harsh personality, to the point of physically abusing her team when they do not perform to her high expectations. However she does care for them, shown when she tried to comfort Kana Ikeda after her loss in the prefectural finals. She is friends with Yasuko Fujita and together they work on a mahjong selection committee. Tsuruga Academy A well-funded academy, the Mahjong club mainly makes use of online mahjong as a training instrument via portable laptops. ; : :Portrayed by: Natsumi Okamoto :Yumi Kajiki is a third year and plays the captain position. Originally very weak at mahjong, she wound up buying a book after a loss to Kanbara in her first year, which allowed her to get much better. While she doesn't have a special ability, she is able to recognize players' abilities and try to form a defense against them as evidenced by her match in the prefectural finals. :Yumi also exhibits great leadership skills which wind up having her mistaken for the club president instead of the laid-back Kanbara. These skills allow Tsuruga to become a strong team and reach the finals for the first time in school history. :Outside of mahjong, Yumi has a particularly strong relationship with Momoko as she was the first one to show interest in her and was responsible for bringing her into the club; it is implied that she chose to come to the training camp in large part to spend time with Momo. And when Kanbara first met Yumi she thought she was a gloomy ice queen, but changed her opinion after they became friends. Initially not able to swim, she learned how to do so under Momo's guidance. She placed 6th in the final Nagano Prefectural Individual Tournament ; : :Portrayed by: Ano :Momoko is a first year, and plays the vice-captain position. She is sought out specifically by Yumi after a match through LAN mahjong, and \\"appears\\" when Yumi calls her out during a class break to acknowledge her skills. The two wind up becoming very close friends, so much so that she gets jealous of others Yumi shows interest in as well as becoming very anxious of what will happen after Yumi graduates. Her speech includes an accent which often adds the ending \\"su\\" and \\"s\\" any to her sentences. :Momo eventually becomes known as \\"Stealth Momo\\", as she uses her negative presence to essentially become invisible at the table. This comes about because she is often ignored by her friends despite her efforts to gain attention. Eventually she gave up on building relationships with other people and thus carried a lacking presence (normally depicted as either completely invisible, fading away from plain sight, or parts of herself slightly dissipating into a steam-like formation). However, this ability can be negated by players who ignore presence such as Nodoka (and later on by Saki, using the same principle that Nodoka subconsciously employed). She placed 12th in the final Nagano Prefectural Individual Tournament. ; : :Portrayed by: Aguri ≈ånishi :Satomi Kanbara is a third year, plays the lieutenant position and is the president of the schools mahjong club. Laid-back in nature, she is always seen with a wide smile and her distinguished laugh. This can tend to lead to incorrect assumptions as Yumi initially thought she was an idiot with an empty-headed grin - but she changed her opinion after they became friends. In reality, she doesn't let anything get to her and has a lot of trust in her team members. She is one of the few who can detect Momo, though only when she is upwind of her. :As she is 18, she has a driver's license and drives a Volkswagen Type 2 Van. Her personality is also reflected in her driving style, which is a bit on the reckless side. Her first time driving was to the beach with her fellow mahjong club members, and this made the rest of the members afraid of her driving. :In Achiga Hen ~ Side A, Satomi appears after they run into the Achiga team who were spying on Harue after reaching the semifinals. After hearing Achiga request to become stronger, she takes them back to her grandmothers place where they ask Yumi for help. When Yumi agrees, Kanbara gets Mihoko to help Achiga as well. She placed 19th in the final Nagano Prefectural Individual Tournament ; : :Portrayed by: Marina Nagasawa :Kaori is a second year and plays the sergeant position. She is recruited by childhood friend Kanbara to complete the team of 5 despite being a beginner. Amazingly, it is shown that she appears to have an enhanced form of beginners luck, allowing her to get big hands against strong opponents. Because of this, she is forbidden from practicing or studying before the individuals, under the belief that she would lose her luck, but not improve enough in that time to compensate for it. :Kaori is a very shy and ditsy girl who gets nervous easily, yet does appear to have a perceptive side having noticed that Saki Miyanaga wasn't the least bit deterred during her match against Kazue Nanpo. ; : :Portrayed by: Mari Yamachi :Mutsuki Tsuyama is a second year, and plays the vanguard position. Nicknamed Mukki by Kanbara, she collects the mahjong star trading card series to which she gives Seika Bundou the collectors card she wanted as a gift. She gets motion sickness from Kanbara's driving. Mutsuki appears to be a very reliable girl and is named the next president of the mahjong club once their tournament is over. National Tournament Shiraitodai High School West Tokyo Prefecture. The first seeded school. This school is the top ranked team in the tournament and has won the last two national titles. Before Miyanaga Teru played for Shiraitodai, Shiraitodai and the West prefecture was infamously known as giving 2nd-rated players. ; : :Played by: Minami Hamabe :Saki's older sister, who is a 3rd year and plays Vanguard position. Head of the Shiraitodai team, she is the national high school individual champion of at least the previous year and is considered to be not only the strongest player in high school, but possibly one of the strongest in the country. In addition to the individual titles, Teru has helped Shiraitodai win the past two national tournaments and is leading them for their third straight title. According to Fujita, she was one of the three monsters to show themselves in national tournaments of the past 2 years (Koromo and Jindai being the others). In each match, she spends the first hand analyzing her opponent's innate abilities. Afterwards, she is capable of going on long winning streaks with the value of each successful hand worth more than the previous. This manifests itself in a tornado on her right arm. She and Sumire form the ToraHime (Tiger and Princess) combination with Teru being the tiger. Due to her winning streaks, she was put on the Vanguard position instead of the Captain position to fully maximize her winning streaks, to the point of deciding some matches by herself when she plummets her opponents' points below zero. :However, her ability does lead to problems. First of all, since the values of her hands must increase with each win, she must find ways to increase the yaku of her hand, which can lead to unusual plays. Second, in analyzing her opponent's abilities she has reached the point where she assumes the players character to be static and unchanging. These issues were made evident in the national semifinals as first she was unable to increase the value of her hands thanks to Kuro's ability to collect dora and thus had to resort to even more drastic measures to achieve her goal. And in the final hand of the hanchan, Kuro changing her mindset and strategy and discarding a dora without fear resulted in Teru being unable to win and instead playing into Kuro's hand ending the hanchan. :As for Teru's personal life, she and her mother moved from Nagano to Tokyo as a result of a separation in the family. While they used to play mahjong when they were all together, Teru now refuses to speak with Saki and denies her younger sister's existence despite her efforts to reach the finals. It is still unknown why she ignores Saki, but according to the manga, it is implied that an accident, which might have been witnessed by Saki, involved a close acquaintance of the two sisters. ; : :Played by: Mikoto Hibi :3rd year, plays Sergeant position. She makes up the Hime (princess) part of the ToraHime (Tiger and Princess) combination with Teru. She is also known as Shiraitodai's \\"Sharpshooter\\". Her main ability is the ability to target a player at the table and then proceed to win off of them by changing her hand to target them with a certain discard. If the opponent were to somehow avoid playing in, she will try change her hand and win off of them again, but this compromises her defense. This playstyle is perfect for targeting the weaker schools and busting them out. This is known as her \\"Piercing Arrow\\". However, unbenounced to her Harue has noticed a tell which involves the movement of her right hand ever so slightly before directing a gaze at the player whom she wishes to target. Matsumi Yuu took advantage of this early on in Achiga's semifinal match against Shiraitodai, dodging the first \\"arrow\\" and attacking when Sumire weakens her defense in response. :Outside of mahjong, Hirose is one of the few who are a friend of Teru's. In addition, she is the only person known to Teru who seems to have had prior knowledge of Saki's existence. She is often noted to treat Teru 'coldly' when referring to Saki. ; : :Played by: RaMu :Takami is a 2nd year who wears glasses and always carries a cup of tea. She plays the Lieutenant position. Her ability is called \\"Harvest Time\\", in which, on the All-Last round, she will have all the tiles that she first discarded in the previous rounds. The length of the round determines the strength of her ability - at best it can result in an immediate Tenhou/Chiho Yakuman and at worst it gives her only 7 tiles (which, if all 7 are dragons, can still result in a Daisangen yakuman). No records of her being last dealer exist; Eguchi Sera speculates that in that case she would be able to continue harvesting Yakuman hands while remaining dealer. ; : :Played by: Karen Iwata :Seiko is a 2nd year who sports a tomboyish look. She plays vice-captain. She is known as The Fisherman of Shiraitodai and her ability involves her \\"fishing\\" (calling) a tile that will advance her hand in the \\"pond\\" (discard pile), and is she manages to fish 3 times, she is guaranteed to win in the next 5 turns. Her playstyle is fast and as such, her opponents need to quickly form their hands if she starts calling. ; : :Played by: Yuumi Shida :Awai is a 1st year and plays the Captain position. She is a blonde-haired girl who is hailed as one of the first year monsters alongside Saki. In fact, according to Hiroko Funakubo, Awai is the nations most dangerous first years, and is considered to be the successor of Teru Miyanaga. Her special ability activates at the beginning of every hand: her hair begins to wave and a night sky appears behind her. After this the starting hand of all her opponents will usually be very poor with a low probability of completion (e.g. hands with 5-6 shanten). Afterwards, her opponents' draws are normal and they usually have to resort to declaring chis, pons or kans to advance their hands which seems to cause them to play more easily in Awai's hands. :This ability of hers is very difficult to get around and only two people have been confirmed to be able to actually beat it - her team mate Takami Shibuya with her \\"Harvest Time\\" ability during the last hand, and Awai's opponent Himeko Tsuruta who, by linking with her team-mate Mairu Shirouzu, can win during a specific round Mairu won (e.g. the East third round). :Awai has a second ability, which involves her declaring double-riichi (riichi on the first turn). Teru states that she has only used this ability publicly once before the Inter-Highs depicted in the manga. It is then explained that Awai's ability begins with declaring double-riichi, then declares kan before rounding the last corner of the wall, wins the hand after passing the last corner, and then turn her kan into uradora immediately scoring 6 han (2 for double-riichi, 4 for the uradora) for an automatic haneman. :Due to her skills and abilities, Awai is considerably confident, cocky, and arrogant, but is shown to be the most talkative and cheerful out of her Shiraitodai team-mates. She seems fairly close to Teru, and calls her by her first name without any honorifics, which is somewhat unusual outside of close friends. Rinkai All-Girls School East Tokyo Prefecture. The fourth seeded school. Rinkai had been well known for recruiting mahjong players from across the world to play for their school. However, a rule which had been implemented forced Rinkai to field one Japanese player for their team. ; : :3rd year, plays vanguard position. As Rinkai's only Japanese mahjong player, she must play vanguard under the new rules. She was the 3rd placer in the Individual tournament last year, right behind Miyanaga Teru and Arakawa Kei. She is determined to end Yuuki's attempt of a continuous dealership due to the fact that Yuuki reminded her of Arakawa Kei. Although she was appointed as the vanguard due to being the only Japanese player, Rinkai's coach and her teammates explicitly mentioned that she's the vanguard and the ace due to her results last year. ; :1st year and plays the sergeant position. Originally coming from Hong Kong, she is Inchon mahjong league's post silver medalist. She was a champion player of Hong Kong mahjong. She decided to play in the Asian Mahjong Tournament but because of difference in rules between Chinese mahjong and Riichi mahjong, she lost badly. Therefore, she decided to play in the Interhigh tournament to get exposure as the Interhigh tournament have rules that are more or less similar as the Asia tournament. :Her way of playing is using MCR mahjong mindset while still playing Riichi mahjong is a perfect counter to Mako. As she plays with the MCR mindset, she does not declare riichi. Due to her background, she does not know some of the rules in the riichi tournament, like the noten penalty. Mako considered her style closely similar to Hisa in which both of them discard tiles that would give them a higher chance of winning to win on a specific tile. ; :2nd year. She is a French-Korean and known as European mahjong league's top ranked player, referred as \\"Venter\\" or \\"The God of Wind\\". :Her family name, ÈõÄ (the second character of the word È∫ªÈõÄ \\"mahjong\\"), is likely to be a misnomer as the character ÈõÄ reads as \\"jak\\" (Ïûë in hangul) in Korean. It is most likely intended to be the similar Â¥î (\\"choe\\", Ïµú in hangul), a common Korean family name which is also romanized \\"Choi\\". :Her main ability, according Kinue Atago, is to always start of with a pung of her seat wind and as such she already has one yaku with her initial thirteen tiles. It is also implied that she has further abilities. :Her father died some time ago, and she has been raised by her mother, a professor, ever since. She hopes to become independent so that her mother will not be as burdened. ; : :3rd year. From America. In the Nationals last year, she fought against Touka in the Vice-Captain battle and had awakened Cold Touka. She was so scared of Cold Touka that she ended up targeting another school, ending the game, resulting in Koromo not being able to play. She was disappointed to hear that she won't be facing Ryuumonbuuchi this year. :Her ability is to be able to tell when others are in tenpai when she herself is in a tenpai, and is able to call announce a duel. Even if she is not in riichi or in damaten, as long as she is in tenpai, she is able to see if other players are in tenpai as well, as seen with a cowboy imagery. When she declares a duel, within 3 turns, either Megan or the other player will lose. Megan would usually win. The weak point of this ability is that she has a likely chance to deal in when her duel is disrupted by having the player whom she has targeted as the player in her duel would intentionally take herself out in tenpai (either to change waits or to betaori). Another weakness is that when she announces a duel with a player, her duel is locked on to that player herself and the other players on the table can use this chance to successfully assassinate her. This weak point was used skillfully by Kinue as Megan dealt in to Kinue when Kinue changed her wait and got herself into a tenpai, distracting Megan to duel with Maya with a kokushi hand. ; :1st year. Originally of Georgian descent. She was World Junior Champion. She occasionally alludes to having a need for money, and possibly as a result of this, is somewhat concerned with what the sponsors of Rinkai's team will think. Eisui All-Girls School Kagoshima Prefecture. Eisui, considered to be the strongest team from the Kyushu region. The third seeded school and its members wear miko (shrine maiden) outfits and stay in solemn rooms during competitions. For this years competition, all the branch families have come together so that Komaki Jindai doesn't have to carry the team by herself. They were responsible for dropping Himematsu into 5th place. ; : :2nd year, plays vanguard position. Referred to as \\"Princess\\" by her teammates and she is an average player when awake, but is considered as a national-class monster when asleep. She's a vessel for 7 out of the 8 Goddesses and as such, one of her notable play style is attacking the weakest player on the table with the Nine Gates yakuman. She is the team's captain and the daughter of the main branch of the family. A year prior to the events of the story she had achieved fame as one of the new monsters of the nationals, but pushed herself too hard and the reason why this year's lineup for Eisui's team consists of the branch families. ; : :3rd year, plays sergeant position. She prefers to wear her school uniform over the miko outfit, and was seen to be only wearing the miko outfit during the match. ; : :1st year, plays lieutenant position. Wins with cheap hands if she senses her opponent's hands coming together. A stoic person who never smiles unless talking about two things-- Muscuvado chips and the demon world. ; : :3rd year, plays vice-captain position. She wears a traditional headdress that scares Nodoka during the quarterfinals. Like Kataoka and Nanpo, Hatsumi wins more often in the north position. Her ability, called the \\"Gates of Evil\\", makes it easy for her to gather north and east tiles, and to a lesser extent, south and west tiles, as a reference to misfortune hailing from the northeast. With her ability, every time she's in the north position, she has a higher chance of playing the Little four winds or the Big four winds yakuman. She is referred as Deadly Storm. ; : :3rd year, plays the captain position. She's been known to play defensively and her records shows that she has never dealt into someone's hand and is only damaged by a tsumo. As the most closely related to Komaki, she is the vessel for the last Goddess and her ability is that she can randomly collect one suit and honor tiles for each round. As such, her hands deals with big damages and this playstyle can only be on the attack, conflicting with her usual defensive playstyle. If she uses this ability she cannot return to her regular playing style until she's been purified so she's always careful when using this ability. She is considered by Suehara as the most dangerous player in Eisui. Senriyama Girl's High North Osaka Prefecture. The second seeded school. Senriyama is considered the strongest school in the Kansai region and the second ranked school in the nation. Senriyama makes its 11th straight national appearance and is the fourth overall seed. Overall, it is also the school's 25th appearance in the national championships. ; : :Played by: Nao Sakura :Third year, plays vanguard position. She is physically weak, but has the ability to predict one turn into the future. However, if she changes her prediction she loses the ability for one go-around. She once tried to see two turns, but that put her back into the hospital. Ryuuka had her promise not to do it again, but unbeknownst to him she has been practicing and has been able to see two turns into the future though it severely drains her. In addition, should she become too fatigued she loses her abilities outright. :In the national semifinals she uses her look two ahead ability to try and stop Teru, and despite her condition pushes even further to see three turns ahead. After the match is over, she collapses due to fatigue and is rushed to the hospital by her teammates. ; : :Played by: Manami Arai :First year, plays sergeant position. Izumi has very stable play and protects points well. However, she is a normal person, without special abilities, and thus, was unable to defend against Hirose Sumire's piercing shots. She seems to think that she's the best first year player in the tournament. She lost to Nodoka last year during the Inter Middle Individual Championship and consider her as a rival. ; : :Played by: Mizuha :Third year, plays lieutenant position. She hates wearing girl's clothes and often wears a t-shirt and shorts, only being forced to wear her uniform during matches. Her playstyle is to play with slow but very big hands, completely the opposite of Ako's playstyle. As a second year she was the teams ace player and did very well during the inter-high tournament. ; : :Played by: Rino Shimazaki :Second year, plays vice-captain position. Analytical in nature, she is able to determine the Matsumi sisters' abilities thus allowing Senriyama to achieve an easy win in their first match against Achiga. Senriyama's coach is Atago Masae, Hiroko's aunt, and there is unfounded gossip that Hiroko only managed to go into the team due to the coach's influence, which the coach hopes will be disproved by Hiroko's performance. ; : :Played by: Yuka Ogura :Third year who plays in the captain position. She is constantly looking after Toki, and hoped Toki would get onto the main team to play alongside her. As the result of Toki resting on her lap so much, she is able to use some of her prediction ability during the semi-finals. However, unlike Toki she is only limited to seeing her own hand. In addition, her usage of the ability is perhaps dependent on the softness of her lap (i.e. how fat her thighs are). Ryuuka briefly considers getting a bit \\"fatter\\" after realizing this, but Toki immediately and vehemently objects to the idea. Himematsu High South Osaka Prefecture. One of the top ranking schools in the Nationals. One of the strongest school in the Kansai region along with their cross-town rival, Senriyama. They were a seeded school until the emergence of Eisui last year, knocking them off to 5th place. ; : :2nd year, plays vanguard position. Kyouko recommended her on the team because of her ability to win explosively albeit rarely. Can do well if the game is all simples. If she fails at a task given to her by Kyouko, as punishment, Kyouko will write something on her forehead. Kyouko says she usually wins explosively the stronger her opponent gets, although sometimes she misfires. At the quarterfinals, she won explosively with a baiman when Satoha switched into an offensive mode. When she's on an explosive streak, she tends to win on high 7-8-9 tiles. ; : :3rd year, plays sergeant position. A careful player who is always seen to be smiling. On both the quarterfinal match and the semi-final match, she finished with a positive score. On a table against Hao, she tend to go for a quick closed hand without declaring riichi. When Mako went on to the attack, Yuuko immediately defended and discards safe tiles. ; : :3rd year, plays lieutenant position. Captain of the Himematsu High's mahjong team, and the older daughter of Senriyama's coach. She has amazing self confidence and the skill to back it up. She is the ace player and one of the few people that can go up against Shiratodai. Known as the \\"Trap Master\\" and uses bluff to manipulate the opponent into unwillingly playing into her big hands. She is considered one of the best players despite not having any special abilities whatsoever as she's able to consistently win with big hands and are able to counteract other strategies against her. ; : :2nd year, plays vice-captain position. Younger sister of Hiroe, she passed up a soccer scholarship to be with her sister though she shows her skills when she inadvertently kicks Etopen thinking it was something else. She seems to have a sister complex for Hiroe, as shown when, after hearing Hiroe speak highly of Kyouko, she wished Hiroe would think of her the same way. ; : :3rd year, plays captain position. She is usually the one that briefs the team about their opponents. She doesn't have any special powers per se, but she is quite adept at three-player mahjong. While Hiroe comes to the table with the mentality that she'll win, she comes to the table with the mentality that she's going to lose. As such, she's always very careful and calculative during the match, passing up a potential win for a higher scoring hand. She took up the challenge of facing against monsters in the captain's position despite being a normal player and as such, Saki considers her as the most resilient player as Kyouko was able to turn a decent scoring hand into a high scoring hand against players with special abilities and win. ; : :Himematsu current acting director. She very cheerful and her eyes are often closed. Miyamori Girl's High Iwate Prefecture. Originally having only three members. Miyamori is one of the few schools who proceed to the second round of the 71st Inter High, and is widely famous for knocking off the high ranking Makabi High. ; : :3rd year, plays vanguard position. She is stoic, quiet, and apathetic. She is very tactical during her matches. According to her teammates, Shiromi has a unique style. When she worries about her hand, it usually means that its high scoring and normally scores her points this way. She is tactful when it comes to her opponents hands and has solid defense. She often discards what others call risky tiles, but it hasn't been shown to backfire on her. ; : :3rd year, plays sergeant position. Originally from New Zealand, she communicates with her teammates with a white board as she doesn't know the language. There's nothing flashy nor anything that stands out about her game but according to Shiromi Kosegawa, Aislinn can draw her ideal table like something from a dream. Whenever she plays she always gets a winning hand and in terms of winning percentage she was first in her country. Kyouko Suehara explains that Aislinn will always get a closed hand tenpai before the 13th turn. ; : :3rd year, plays lieutenant position. Kurumi doesn't declare riichi during her matches. She does this so her opponents can't tell if shes in tenpai or not. She doesn't tolerate any of Hiroe's loudmouthedness. ; : :3rd year, plays vice- captain position and wears a monocle. She has the ability to \\"mark\\" an opponent by keeping her gaze on them, so that they will not be able to complete a hand. This ability though is very fatiguing and can cause her to be on the verge of collapse afterwards. She was responsible for taking out Makabi High's strongest player and getting Miyamori to the nationals. She seems to look up to Coach Kumakura, even using her monocle. This monocle seems to have some sort of power to it, as the lens clouds over when someone is away to win with a big hand. It also seems to react to \\"monster\\" players as it shatters due to Saki Miyanaga's power. ; : :3rd year, plays captain position. Toyone's most distinguishing characteristic is that she is very tall (taller than Jun), usually wears large brim hats, and has unique eyes. Recruited from a rural area in Iwate, she possesses the \\"Rokuyou\\" abilities. One is to declare a riichi after another player declares, winning off of the initial riichi, which is known as \\"Senbu\\". This is where she gains her nickname of Right-behind-you- Toyone. Her second ability is to win when she has one tile remaining in her hand, which is known as \\"Tomobiki\\". A third ability is called \\"Shakkou\\" and this ability allows her to call dora tiles by having the surrounding two tiles (for example, in the manga, when Toyone is told to use Shakkou, Toyone calls the four of bamboos, which is a dora tile, with the three and five of bamboos). It is unknown if Toyone has other abilities related to the other \\"Rokuyou\\". :Since she lives in the rural area of Iwate, and due to her village not having many young people, Toyone learnt how to play Mahjong by watching matches on the television and using her own mahjong set. Due to watching a lot of mahjong matches on television, she is a fan of \\"Mahjong idols\\" like Jindai and Nodoka. At the end of the captain's match, aside from asking Jindai's and Nodoka's autograph, she also asked for Saki's, Kasumi's and Kyouko's autographs. ; : :She Miyamori's coach and seems to be a very adept mahjong player as when she is first introduced to the girls, they have a friendly match and she repeatedly brings them all below zero. She was responsible for recruiting Harue for the company team in Fukuoka. They meet up again at nationals where she inquires about Harue going pro once again. However, she is rebuffed by Harue as she states that she wants to see her team through first before thinking about herself. During the matches, she gives her monocle to Sae. She also seems to know a lot about the competition as she frequently provides commentary on the matches to the Miyamori students and offers them advice. Shindouji Girl's High Fukuoka Prefecture. This team has a history of reaching the national tournament, however with bad results. ; : :Played by: Yuuka Yano :2nd year, plays vanguard position. Attended the same Takatoobara Middle School that Nodoka and Yuki attended. Was chosen over their 5th best player, Tomokiyo, to be a sacrificial lamb. The team has been re- structured from weakest to strongest this year to try and counteract other teams' strategies, and as such her ability to not lose all her points means the team at least survives for one round. Although Himeko feared she would be upset by knowing that she was not chosen for her skill, she's glad to be of some use to them. She constantly likes to say , even when the situation is bad. ; : :Played by: Rio Kotomi :3rd year, plays sergeant position. She is Shindouji's 4th best player. Her ability is not described at this point, but Sumire and Izumi both notice that her playing style in the semifinals differs from her records or prior games. Sumire goes further to state that it's as if she's going for big hands but winds up settling for something cheaper. The reason for this was because it was to counteract Sumire from using her \\"Piercing Arrow\\" playstyle. She was shown to be relieved when Sumire went to target other schools instead. ; : :Played by: Haruka Iwasaki :3rd year, plays the lieutenant position. She is Shindouji's 3rd best player. She seems to think that the reason Shindouji went back from 3rd to 4th place was because of the government's doing. ; : :Played by: Riho Takada :3rd year, plays vice- captain position. She is Shindouji's 2nd best player and the captain of the Shindouji's Mahjong club. She was the ace of Shindouji last year and the reason why Shindouji did very badly last year was because of her as she wasn't able to match up to other school's aces. She was the one who suggested to use Kirame as a sacrificial pawn. Her and Himeko's ability is called the \\"Tsuru no Ongaeshi\\" or \\"The Return Of Gratitude of The White Crane\\". That means that if Mairu binds herself and win a han, on the next match, Himeko is guaranteed to win it with double the han. (If Mairu wins with 2 han, Himeko would win it with 4 han, 3 han to 6 han, and so forth). :The downside is that if Mairu doesn't win, it'll be difficult for Himeko to win that round, and only at 1 han at best. Also, for example, if Mairu binds herself with 3 han but she managed to chance an uradora that increased her han, the additional han will not pass over to Himeko, so Mairu is careful at binding the hans she could accomplish. :Hers and Himeko's ability are the reason for Shindouji's lineup. 3 years prior, both of them were a terror in the Inter Middle. Mairu faced of Teru in a match in a previous year and that's the reason why Shiraitodai know of their ability which is nigh impossible to detect. ; : :Played by: Sae Okazaki :2nd year, plays captain position. She is currently Shindouji's best mahjong player. Her and Mairu's ability is called the \\"Tsuru no Ongaeshi\\" or \\"The Return Of Gratitude of The White Crane\\". A third player for Shindouji. She wears a uniform that has a sleeve too long for her and has been with Mairu ever since middle school. She and Mairu are considered as Shindouji's double aces. When Mairu successfully binds a han, a key appears before her. The key appears during the round in her turn and if she uses it, she‚Äôll be able to win it double the han. Hers and Mairu‚Äôs linked ability is so powerful that it was able to override Awai‚Äôs 5-6 isshanten ability. Her key is so strong that it even negates Ryuuka's predictions. Usuzan High School From South Hokkaido. Like Kiyosumi, this is Usuzan's first time appearing at the Nationals. Mizuhara-pro had stated that Usuzan is one of the scarier schools to face. They did not catch up to Rinkai in the Quarterfinal match until the vice-captain match. They use the same tactic as Shindouji and Makabi with their line-up being weakest to strongest. However, unlike Shindouji, only their vice-captain and captain are National-class players. The captain is however, in a higher league from their already strong vice-captain. ; : :A 2nd year student who plays the Vanguard position. She has light purple hair with her bangs covering half of her face, and her hair tied into two twintails at the back of her head. She was mostly tenpai in the vanguard match but hardly wins any hand and gets ronned instead. Satoha uses her to deal blow one of Suzu's fuse. Her performance is described as \\"lackluster\\". ; :A 3rd year student who plays the Sergeant position. She is tall and has blond hair, with thick eyebrows that have a \\"cross\\" pattern. She is a beginner at mahjong but Hiroko Funakubo stated that she had put in some effort to get better. She tends to call tiles to get into an empty tenpai so that she won't get the noten penalty. ; :A 2nd year who plays the Lieutenant position. She has black, unruly hair which is tied into a pony tail. She also wears a jacket. She likes to sew and she was the one who sew Maya's idol outfit. She is a relatively weak player, only winning one small hand toward the end. During the semi-final match, Usuzan is in critical condition and had initially planned to manipulate and use Hisa to score points to have Usuzan get a higher score but failed when Hisa started her. ; : A 1st year who plays the Vice-Captain position. She has long dark hair, but is notably shorter and has the biggest breasts compared to the other Usuzan girls. She is one of Usuzan's players who plays at a national-level. She has an unreserved nature and does what she wants therefore she does not mind wearing idol clothes or becoming the next idol. When she was in middle school, she was a loner and was being bullied without her knowing by her classmates but was helped by the remaining Usuzan team members to come out of her shell. She joined Usuzan because of them and was groomed by the Usuzan girls to become one of the next mahjong idols. Coming from a Christian school, her ability shows this and activates only one time per day. When she uses her left hand to pick up tiles, a Jehovah symbol will appear. She'll quote a bible verse and her hand will be completed with shining tsumo- her tsumo having a heavy payout hand with a mangan as the minimum points that she can score. Aside from her ability, she is a naturally great mahjong player and is always seen to be on tenpai for expensive-scoring hands, even managing a kokushi tenpai against Megan. ; :A 3rd year student who plays the Captain position. She has red hair and ties it into a sad ponytail. Her eyes have a triangle pattern on them. She is aiming to turn Maya into the next mahjong idol like Mizuhara-pro. She is one of Usuzan's players who plays at a national-level, however, it seems that she is on a higher level than Maya. Kentani High School Hyougo Prefecture. One of the contenders by bringing one of the team's score below zero during its first match round. ; : :A 3rd year student who plays the Vanguard position. She has a yellow-whitish bob cut hair. ; : :A 2nd year student who plays the Sergeant position. She has green hair and always looks like she's not confident. ; : :A 3rd year student, plays the Lieutenant position and Kentani High's club president. She plays defensively consistently throughout the match. She entrusted their two new recruits as the Vice-Captain and the Captain despite having more experience. ; : :A 1st year student who plays the Vice-Captain position. She used to live abroad before going to Kentani and she does not know much about Japanese customs. She managed to hit a dealer's baiman and scored the most points in the Vice- Captain position. ; : :A 1st year student who plays the Captain's position. She has a flower headband. She paid into Shizuno on the final hand causing Achiga to advance into the next round instead of Kentani. Koshigaya Girl's High School Saitama Prefecture. Koshigaya had never advanced into the second round in its previous four appearances in the Inter High until this year. ; : :A 3rd year who plays the Vanguard position. A half-Japanese girl with dark skin and sports a weave. ; : :A 3rd year who plays the Sergeant position. She wears a skater's hat and ear piercing. She speaks in a skater slang. ; : :A 1st year who plays the Lieutenant position. She is always seen to be fixing her appearance. ; : :A 3rd year who plays the Vice-Captain position. She have been drawn with different eyes who goes up and down in the manga, and wears a clown hat. She was responsible for losing the most points for Koshigaya. Funakubo didn't think she was much of a threat. ; : :A 2nd year who plays the captain position, and was able to bring her team through the first round for the first time in five years. In her second round match she was tasked with a 50000 point comeback, but was not able to get anywhere. Her final damaten hand actually sealed her defeat because it didn't give her enough points. She wears a headband with a sword attach to it. Commentators ; : :Played by: Natsuna Watanabe :Fujita is a professional mahjong player who is first introduced when Hisa invites her to play against Saki and Nodoka at Mako's grandfather's mahjong parlor. She is a strong player, but has a good sense of opponents with great power, such as Koromo and Saki. She acts as a commentator for mahjong tournaments, often seen eating a bowl of katsudon, where she provides some unique insight into how the players play. While she respects how Koromo plays the game, having lost to her once, she cannot help but tease her small stature. She has mistakenly referred to Yumi Kajiki as Tsuruga's mahjong club's president on multiple occasions. ; : :Played by: Ayu Higashi :A professional mahjong player and works as a commentator for the All Japan High School Mahjong Tournament along with Kouko Fukuyo. She is the youngest person to hold eight mahjong tournament trophies. She had previously won the mahjong nationals ten years ago (defeating Harue in the process), though now she doesn't participate in many tournaments and thus carries a low ranking. ; : :An announcer who commentates alongside Sukoya. She is rather energetic and tends to embarrass Sukoya over the air a lot. ; : :Eri is an announcer who commentates alongside Uta. She makes her play-by-play calls in a somewhat serious manner, thus she becomes annoyed at Uta's flightiness in answering her questions. ; : :Uta is a color commentator for the inter-high and a professional mahjong player. She wears a kimono and carries a paper fan. She is also currently the vanguard for the All-Japan team. She is paired with Eri Hariu and they are main commentator team in Saki Achiga Hen episode of side A. She is very knowledgeable but prone to be a bit flighty, commonly making an observation, only to say \\"I don't really know\\" soon afterward. Others ; : :Kazue is a student from Hirataki High School who enters the individual tournament. Similar to Y≈´ki, her play is most powerful during the south wind rounds. Her name is a pun on kaze (wind) and wind seems to blow behind her whenever she awakens and her surname is a reference for her strength during the south wind round. She is a strong player in a weak school, and entered the individual tournament to prove the strength of her grandfather's play style without being held back by her teammates. She placed 5th in the Nagano Prefectural Individual Tournament. ; : :A 2nd year student at Sangamaki High. She is one of the Individual participants hailing from North Osaka. She wears a nurses outfit as a school uniform. The second placer in the Individual Tournament last year just after Miyanaga Teru. She is one of the few people that can put up a good fight against Shiraitodai. Kei is very friendly and was the only one who accepted to help Achiga when they called for friendly battle. During the final Individual tournament last year, even though she was just a first year, she had a smile on her face throughout the match despite the match being dominated by Teru, which gave Satoha a strong impression. Although, considered one of last year's 'mahjong monsters' next to Koromo and Jindai, Sangamaki High did not advance to the Nationals in the team tournament as Kei couldn't carry the team by herself and ultimately lost in combined power against Senriyama. ; : :Y≈çko is a second-year high school student, and the vanguard of the Imamiya Girls' High School mahjong team. She loses to Y≈´ki in the first round of the local mahjong tournament. Later on, she takes Nodoka's stuffed penguin as a prank. She soon regrets the prank, apologizing to Nodoka along with Mai. ; : :Mai is a third-year high school student, and the vice-captain of the Imamiya Girls' High School mahjong team. She loses to Nodoka in the first round of the local mahjong tournament. Along with Y≈çko, she takes away Nodoka's stuffed penguin. The two soon regret the prank and both apologize to Nodoka. ; :A second year junior-high student at Nodoka's old school, one of her underclassman. Her ability is to mimic other mahjong player's playing styles, such as Saki's rinshan kaih≈ç. However, she can only mimic a specific ability once a day, and she otherwise makes a lot of amateur mistakes, in spite of having practiced for a long time. She is invited to Kiyosumi's training camp both to invoke fear into Saki and help Mako deal with beginners. ; :A third year junior-high student at the same school as Maho.

It is directed towards the liberation of women from all kinds of oppression and exploitation based on sex, race or class. In the Philippines, it is engaged in direct services for survivors of incest, rape and the sex trade. History By 1981, TW-MAE-W had initiated a number of demonstrations in the Southeast Asian capitals to gain momentum and support. It spearheaded the protest against Japanese sex tours on Human Rights Day, December 10, 1980, its foundation date. The programme really got going after Brother Andrew, head of La Salle University, offered scholarships to learn computer work to a mama san (brothel manager), her daughter and two bar girls. From this small beginning, TW-MAE-W created seven drop-in centres and three homes around the country, run by 35 female staff members. In addition, the Bethany Transition Home in Quezon City, Manila, houses 10-20 women, all of whom have outside jobs. In 2007, they held an Anti-Human Trafficking workshop. Programs and services The programs and services of TW-MAE-W are geared towards the sector of children and women survivors of sexual abuse and exploitation. They offer Drop-In Centers and Growth Homes and Transition Homes to victims. Livelihood projects Handbags are made by their women using materials from different sources which are then sold. Other income-generating projects include beekeeping (honey production), candlemaking, catering, and massage.

With the color co-site sampling identically colored pixels in several frames of the specimen, obtained by moving the sensor with a piezo mechanism in a regular raster, are combined to a sharp resulting image. The detector, however, can also be translated by a fraction of the pixel pitch: this way also the interstitial space between sensor pixels gets scanned and the number of pixels in the final image is increased. Three positions on the x and y axes increase the image size by a factor of 9, for instance from the common 1388 x 1040 pixels to 4164 x 3120 pixels (see Sony ICX285 series). The color co-site sampling used at the same time ensures correct reproduction of colors at the pixel density produced. Whether the spatial resolution will increase accordingly, depends on the optical resolution of the complete system. The relevant parameter is the resolving power, i.e. how many lines per mm can be resolved. It increases with the aperture of the optical system and is inversely proportional to its magnification. As a result, a low-resolution camera with 500 lines would be enough for an 100X objective with 0.9 aperture. On the other hand, low-magnification objectives profit most from micro scanning: for instance for a 2,5X objective with N.A.=0.12 cameras with as high as 2500 lines resolution could be used.

Colour co-site sampling is a system of photographic colour sensing, wherein 4, 16 or 36 images are collected from the sensor and merged to form a single image. Each subsequent image physically moves the sensor by exactly one pixel, in order to collect R, G and B data for each pixel, known as microscanning. This is a viable alternative to the typical Bayer filter array of pixels which returns a lower quality images with interpolated pixel colours. Operation Several images are captured and combined to a sharp resulting image. After the acquisition of each image a piezo mechanism moves the sensor by precisely the distance of one pixel and delivers the complete colour information for each detail and with the same sharpness in all three colour channels. Microscanning is essential for the method. 4 (2√ó2), 16 (4√ó4) or 36 (6√ó6) shots can be used for improved colour reproduction. * Advantages ** Higher resolution possible in comparison with the basic CCD pixel count ** No colour interpolation required ** Better sensitivity than a three-chip camera ** Live colour image possible at the basic CCD sensor's resolution ** Only one colour sensor required * Disadvantages ** Stable imaging conditions required due to microscanning ** Longer acquisition times because of multiple exposures During the acquisition, the sensor is moved by the distance of one pixel. Thus every pixel is scanned at least once in all three colours. Comparison to Bayer filter The colour CCD is moved to 2√ó2 positions, sampling the colour information of the corresponding pixel at each location of the sensor. With standard digital cameras, colour images are acquired with only one sensor (see CCD and CMOS sensor). Each pixel of the sensor is sensitive to just one of the three basic colours. For each single pixel on the CCD only one third of the required information is provided and two thirds are missing, as at least three monochrome pixels would be necessary for one colour pixel. As only one image is acquired, the missing colour information is determined by the interpolation. In current cameras sophisticated interpolation algorithms are used to reconstruct the colour information (see filter mosaics, interpolation, and aliasing), so the reduction in the \\"colour\\" resolution can turn out to be better than the expected one third. Because of the interpolation, however, unwanted side-effect artifacts, such as colour Moire patterns or false coloured edges, can occur. * Advantages ** R, G, B in one exposure ** Colour live image and dynamic scenes possible * Disadvantages ** Colour interpolation ** Reduced spatial resolution ** Susceptible to colour errors References * European patent EP0396687 (1989-10-26), Reimar Lenz, Optoelectronic image sensor Family patent of that EP687 patrent is also published as US5877807 .

He has written music for orchestra, chamber ensemble, choir, and instruments including the piano, violin, cello, flute, mandolin, guitar, harp, organ, as well as about sixty- five pieces of music with graphic notation. His compositions have been performed in numerous countries with different orchestras under conductors such as Aldo Ceccato, Errico Fresis, Clytus Gottwald, Juan Pablo Izquierdo, Erhard Karkoschka, Herbert Kegel, Lukas Foss, Zubin Mehta, Hermann Scherchen, and Ingo Schulz. The scores of his graphic music have been shown in various exhibitions linked to concerts, such as in the Staatsgalerie Stuttgart, Kunsthaus Hamburg, the Wilhelm-Hack-Museum, Ludwigshafen, and the Stadtgalerie Saarbr√ºcken. Biography Schidlowsky pursued his secondary studies at the Instituto Nacional de Chile in Santiago from 1940‚Äì47 and studied the piano with Roberto Duncker at the Conservatorio Nacional de Chile in Santiago from 1942-48. He later studied composition with Juan Allende-Blin and Fr√© Focke, as well as philosophy and psychology at the Universidad de Chile in Santiago from 1948-51. He completed his studies in Germany at the Nordwestdeutsche Musikakademie (later Hochschule f√ºr Musik Detmold) in Detmold, where he met his future wife Susanne, whom he married in 1953. They had five children (David, Elias, Judith, and twins Yuval and Noam). Chile (1954-1968; 2014) After his return to Chile in 1954 Leon Schidlowsky became a member of the avant-garde ensemble Grupo Tonus in Santiago and served as its director from 1958-61\\\\. This ensemble wanted to spread avant-garde and contemporary music in Chile. In 1956 Schidlowsky produced \\"Nacimiento\\", considered the first electroacoustic work composed in Latin America. Between 1956 and 1959 he was member of the British Council and between 1956 and 1961 a musical adviser of the pantomime ensemble Grupo Noisvander. He served as director of the music library at the Instituto de Extensi√≥n Musical, of the Universidad de Chile (Chilean University) in 1961-62, and as secretary-general of the Asociaci√≥n Nacional de Compositores from 1961-63. He also served as director-general of the Instituto de Extensi√≥n Musical, Universidad de Chile, from 1962-66. In this period the Institute achieved distinction, with the performance of music that had never been played in Chile before, and with the performance of at least one work by a Chilean composer every year. Besides that, a number of orchestral conductors, soloists, and foreign orchestras visited Chile and made a substantial contribution to the musical culture of the country. In 1964 he was, together with Luigi Dallapiccola and Alberto Ginastera, a member of the jury in a composers' competition in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The same year he took part in the music symposium \\"Latin America and the music of our time\\" (Am√©rica Latina y la m√∫sica de nuestros tiempos) in Lima, Peru. In 1965, Schidlowsky was appointed Professor of Composition at the Conservatorio Nacional, Universidad de Chile (Chilean University). In 1966 he participated in the Inter-American Festival in Washington, D.C., USA, as well as the Festival Interamericano de M√∫sica in Caracas, Venezuela. In 1967, he took part in the Festival of Music from Spain and Latin America, in Madrid, Spain. He participated in the \\"Festival of the Three Worlds\\" in M√©rida, Venezuela in 1968, with lectures and discussions with the composers Krzyztof Penderecki and Luigi Nono. The city of M√©rida nominated him a \\"Distinguished Guest of the City\\". In the same year he received a Fellowship from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation in order to write an opera, which he completed in Germany. On 21 August 2014 Leon Schidlowsky was awarded the Chilean National Prize for Musical Arts, accompanied by several homages, press articles and interviews in the local press. Israel In 1969, he was appointed Professor for Composition and Music Theory at the Samuel Rubin Academy of Music at Tel Aviv University. In 1979 he was granted a Sabbatical Year, which he spent in Hamburg. He has given many conferences in Berlin, Hamburg and Stuttgart (Germany), Vienna (Austria), Lund (Sweden), and Saragossa (Spain). Schidlowsky received several fellowships from the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD), and stayed in Berlin for various periods, where he composed and painted. During one of these sojourns, in 1999, his wife Susanne died; she was buried in Tel Aviv. Leon Schidlowsky received various prizes for his music, such as at the regular Festivals of Chilean Music (Festivales de M√∫sica Chilena), with works of his being awarded the Chilean Prize CRAV. In 1996 he received the First Prize for his work Absalom in the 60th anniversary competition of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra. In 2000 he was awarded the ACUM Prize for his entire oeuvre by the Israel Composers Association. In the following year, during a visit to Chile, the Chilean Chamber Orchestra declared him an Honorary Member, the Universidad de Chile appointed him an Honorary Professor in its Arts Faculty, and the Chilean Ministry of Education conferred on him the \\"Orden al M√©rito Docente y Cultural Gabriela Mistral\\" with the rank of \\"Caballero\\". He received the Engel Prize for his original work and his research into Jewish music, awarded by the city of Tel Aviv in June 2007. Leon Schidlowsky has given courses in composition in several countries; and he has helped to form and influence a whole generation of composers in Israel, like Avraham Amzallag, Chaya Arbel, Mary Even-Or, Rachel Galinne, Betty Olivero, Jan Radzynski, Ruben Seroussi, Ron Weidberg, Moshe Zorman. Works Many of his works make reference to his Jewish-Israeli identity and to the history of the Jewish people, as well as to his interest in history and the political and social situation in Chile and Latin America. There is also in his works a musical response to his personal life and experience, such as the death of his wife Susanne (1999) and his son Elias (2004), or the destiny of many personal and professional friends, or personalities of his time. As an admirer of Arnold Schoenberg¬¥s music, Schidlowsky began his career as a composer in the tradition of the Second Viennese School. His music is also highly influenced by Edgard Var√®se, specially on his concern with timbre and freedom of form. Later he began to use serial techniques, and to experiment with various tonal concepts (atonal, aleatoric, graphic notation), but always on the understanding that music has a deeper significance which transcends absolute art, which can open up a path for a human being to find a way to himself (Schidlowsky: \\"Art itself has not only one meaning. It includes and encompasses all senses, questions and all answers. I think that art is a way to us.\\"). Leon Schidlowsky has written dramatic and vivid works.

His family would come to epitomize the ideal of cultural synthesis in Ireland, becoming More Irish than the Irish themselves, fusing Gaelic and Norman customs in Irish identity. \\"But others say that he never enjoyed that lordship himself, but passed it the son and grandson of his eldest brother Gerald.\\"Hickson, M. \\"Miscellanea\\", Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, 1894, p. 188 Career He was born in 1238 in Wexford, Ireland, the second son of Maurice FitzGerald, 2nd Lord of Offaly and Juliana de Grenville. He had three brothers, Gerald fitz Maurice II (died 1243), Thomas fitz Maurice (died 1271), and David fitz Maurice (died without issue). Maurice was known by the nickname of Maurice Mael (from an old word meaning \\"devotee\\" in Irish). He was granted his father's lands in Connacht in exchange for quitclaiming the barony of Offaly sometime before 20 May 1257,Red Book of the earls of Kildare, no. 31 when his father Maurice FitzGerald II died at Youghal Monastery.

The capture of the three magnates led to a private war in Ireland, with the Geraldines on one side and Walter de Burgh and Geoffrey de Geneville on the other. However, the Second Barons' War in England forced them to come to a temporary peace while they battled Montfortians in the English Midlands in 1266.R. Frame, 'Ireland and the Barons' Wars', in Ireland and Britain, 1170-1450, pp 62-3. In May 1265, Maurice FitzMaurice was among the chief magnates in Ireland summoned to inform King Henry III of England and his son Prince Edward about conditions in the country, and again in June 1265. These were the result of the private war between the Geraldines and Walter de Burgh, lord of Connacht (who was later made the 1st earl of Ulster). Maurice was appointed Justiciar of Ireland on 23 June 1272 following the accidental death of his predecessor, James de Audley on 11 June of that year; his father had served in the same capacity from 1232 to 1245. Maurice himself held the post until September 1273, when he was succeeded by Sir Geoffrey de Geneville, Seigneur de Vaucouleurs. He held four knight's fees in both Lea and Geashill from Roger Mortimer, 1st Baron Mortimer who had inherited them from his wife, Maud de Braose.Calendar of Documents., Ire. 125-84, p. 467 In 1276, he led a force of men from Connacht against the Irish of County Wicklow. Maurice's contingent joined the main army of English settlers jointly commanded by his son-in-law, Thomas de Clare, Lord of Inchiquin and Youghal who had been made Lord of Thomond earlier that same year, and Sir Geoffrey de Geneville, Maurice's successor as Justiciar of Ireland. The English under Thomas de Clare and Geoffrey de Geneville attacked the Irish at Glenmalure, but were defeated and suffered heavy losses.Annette J.

Together he and Maud had two daughters:Richardson, Douglas. Royal Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families. Vol. IV, (2013), pp. 431-432, [Prendergast-8]. Burke, Bernard. \\"Prendergast Lineage\\", A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Colonial Gentry, Harrison, 1895, p. 773. Note: Though genealogists have long placed Emmeline as mother of Juliana (e.g. The Complete Peerage, Vol.VII, p.200), Emmeline married FitzGerald in 1273 when Juliana was already 10 years old, and her own heiress was Maud La Zouche, Baroness Holland, who was a granddaughter of her elder sister, Ela Longespee. * Juliana FitzMaurice (d. 24 September 1300), married firstly, Thomas de Clare, Lord of Thomond, by whom she had four children; she married secondly Nicholas Avenel, and thirdly, Adam de Cretynges. * Amabel FitzMaurice, married but died childless. Maurice was Maud's third husband. She died on an unknown date. In 1273, Maurice married his second wife, Emmeline Longespee (1252‚Äì1291), daughter of Stephen Longesp√©e and Emmeline de Ridelsford. He and Emeline had no issue.Richardson, Douglas. Royal Ancestry: A Study in Colonial and Medieval Families. Vol. IV, (2013), pp. 431-432, [Prendergast-8]. Maurice died 2 September 1277, at Ross, County Wexford. Emmeline Longespee then fought until her death to claim her dower against her daughter, Juliana, her step-daughter, Amabilia, and John FitzGerald, who would be created 1st Earl of Kildare on 14 May 1316. John was the son of his brother Thomas by Rohesia de St. Michael. John sued or physically took lands from the bailiffs of Emmeline, Juliana, and Amabilia.Cormac O Cleirigh, 'John fitz Thomas' PhD thesis, Trinity College (1996) There is some confusion as to whether Gerald Fitzmaurice FitzGerald was the first or second son of Maurice FitzGerald, 2nd Lord of Offaly. Most, like M. Hickson, of the RSAI say he was the eldest. Lord Walter FitzGerald says he was the second. In any event, he predeceased his father in 1243. His son, Maurice FitzGerald,The first indicator that Maurice fitz Gerald III was 'full- age' was a mandate to him by the Montfort-government in England in 1264, 21 years after his father's death.

Gerald's marriage was sold to Geoffrey de Geneville, who matched Gerald with his own daughter, Joan, but he died childless on 29 August 1287.

At this moment, a subsequently-famous photograph was taken from which a statue was cast.Sinclair, Upton; Sagarin, Edward; Teichnerhe, Albert; Cry for Justice: An Anthology of the Literature of Social Protest p. 438; L. Stuart, 1963. The August 1941 edition of the Croatian daily newspaper Vjesnik, then the primary media publication of the Partisan resistance movement, featured the statement \\"Smrt fa≈°izmu, sloboda narodu\\". The slogan was part of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia's 1941 call to arms for the people of Yugoslavia. The Bulletin of the Partisan Supreme Headquarters uses the slogan in its first issue dated 16 August 1941.Zbornik dokumenata i podataka o narodno-oslobodilaƒçkom ratu jugoslovenskih naroda.

Barnwell Priory was an Augustinian priory at Barnwell in Cambridgeshire, founded as a house of Canons Regular. The only surviving parts are 13th-century claustral building, which is a Grade II* listed, and remnants found in the walls, cellar and gardens of Abbey House. The priory was home to the Barnwell chronicler, an anonymous chronicler who wrote about the reign of King John. History The priory was founded in c.1092 by Picot of Cambridge, High Sheriff of Cambridgeshire, as a house of canons regular in St Giles' Church by Cambridge Castle. The Liber Memorandorum Ecclesie de Bernewelle (the Book of Things to do with Barnwell) says that Picot's wife, Hugolina, had been gravely ill and vowed that if she recovered, she would found a religious house. She recovered: although Picot endowed the priory, it could well have been on his wife's instructions.https://archive.org/details/libermemorandor00clar/page/38/mode/2upHarmon, J. (2016), 'Some aspects of the history of Barnwell Priory', https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/66837/1/Thesis_Final.pdf, p.152 Two other East Anglian houses of canons regular were founded around this time: Colchester Priory and Huntingdon Priory. It is likely that Picot's foundation was established using canons from one of these houses, probably Huntingdon (whose canons later went to found Merton Priory).Harmon, p.198. Canons regular followed the Rule of St Augustine. Picot endowed the six brethren with an income from tithes and with a number of rectories. After Picot and Hugolina's death, the priory fell into the hands of Henry I, who then gave it to Pain Peverel. Not much is known about Pain Peverel, but he had ambitions for the priory, and persuaded Henry to grant him land on the eastern edge of Cambridge so that he could move and expand the priory, which now became Barnwell Priory. These lands increased by donations from local landowners, and over time the priory itself grew in size and strength until there were 30 canons in residence. Barnwell held an annual fair, the Barnwell or Midsummer Fair, which added to its income. Having an active scriptorium, well-stocked library and, because of its role as landlord, plenty of business for attorneys, Barnwell seems to have helped the early University of Cambridge become established.Harmon, pp.80-102; Brundage, J. (1993), 'The Cambridge Faculty of Canon Law and the Ecclesiastical Courts of Ely' in Medieval Cambridge: Essays on the Pre-reformation University, ed. Zutshi, P. N.

The priory was dissolved on 11 November 1538 as part of the general Dissolution of the Monasteries and granted to Anthony Brown c.1546 and Edward, Lord Clinton c.1552. The buildings became ruinous and were almost thoroughly destroyed in 1810.

After the return to democracy in 1999, he was the elected senator for the Kogi West constituency of Kogi State from May 1999 to May 2007. He is an influential figure in Kogi State politics. A biography on Ogbeha titled \\"Jonathan Tunde Ogbeha: A Noble Path\\" was written by Innocent Nzeke Waniko, a journalist, and presented publicly on 1 September 2017. The book chronicles the early life and comprehensively captures the life and career of Ogbeha. Birth and education Tunde Ogbeha was born in Lokoja, Kogi State in 1947. After obtaining a West African School Certificate, he attended the Nigerian Military School, Zaria, where he obtained a Nigerian Defense Academy diploma in 1970. In 1986, he attended National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies in Kuru for a year. Military career Tunde Ogbeha was commissioned second lieutenant in 1970. As a colonel in December 1983, he was involved in the military coup when President Shehu Shagari was replaced by Major-General Muhammadu Buhari. Ogbeha approached Captain Augustine A. Anyogo of the Brigade of Guards and told him to arrest the president at midnight. Anyogo refused and alerted his superior officer, who arranged for increased security around the State House. However, the coup succeeded despite these measures. Ogbeha played a prominent role in the subsequent coup of August 1985, when General Ibrahim Babangida ousted Buhari's government. Brigadier Ibrahim Bako was the other senior army officer and coup conspirator who accompanied Colonel Ogbeha to arrest President Shagari during the coup. Bako was killed under murky circumstances, likely cross fire and confusion that ensued between the Brigade of Guards loyal to President Shagari and the army detachment accompanying Bako and Ogbeha to arrest President Shagari. In 1985, he was appointed an ambassador to Equatorial Guinea. In 1987, he was appointed military governor of the newly formed Akwa Ibom State. In 1988, he was appointed military governor of the now defunct Bendel State. Reminiscing about the period, Ogbeha said that he was not in the vanguard for the 1991 creation of Kogi State, but helped in its creation because he was a trusted advisor of President Ibrahim Babangida. He voluntary retired as a brigadier-general in 1993, after Babangida stepped down from power. Senate career In 1998, Ogbeha and his close friend General David Medaese Jemibewon, a former military governor of Oyo State, were a team in Kogi State. In the April 1999 elections, Ogbeha ran for the Senate and was elected to represent Kogi West on the platform of People's Democratic Party (PDP), while Jemibewon obtained the ministerial post allocated to Kogi State in the new government. In 2003, Ogbeha and David Jemibewon were rivals for the Kogi West PDP senate candidacy. However, Ogbeha was backed by president Olusegun Obasanjo. He was chosen as PDP candidate and reelected to the Senate in April 2003. Ogbeha was appointed chairman of the Senate Committee on Water Resources, in which role he attended the Fourth World Water Forum, March 16‚Äì22, 2006, in Mexico city. In a December 2005 interview, Ogbeha said \\"The constitution was made without the thought that we will have cowboys who will operate it and these cowboys are bringing us shame and disgrace\\". He strongly criticized the current leaders for wanton and unbridled corruption. As senator for Kogi West, Ogbeha advocated a new Kogi State comprising the Okun Yorubas and the people of Kogi Central. He said that the people of Kogi East should constitute a separate state. He chose not to run for another term in 2007. Outgoing President Olusegun Obasanjo had been campaigning for Tunde Ogbeha to become National Secretary of the PDP, which may have been the reason for Ogbeha' decision, but eventually he gave his support to Alhaji Abubakar Kawu Baraje as PDP secretary. Later career After leaving the Senate, Ogbeha became Chairman of the Confluence Cable Network, Kogi State's first private broadcasting station. He also became a member of the board of Falcon Securities, a stock brokerage established by Peter Ukuoritsemofe Ololo in 1993. Ololo was arrested in 2009 by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission on charges that a huge portion of the loans taken by Ololo‚Äôs firms were carried out illegally. Ogbeha was not implicated in the charges. In July 2009, President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua appointed Tunde Ogbeha to the Board of the Niger Delta Development Commission, representing the non-oil-producing North Central region.

The Dentici family were already in the grocery business when in 1967 Joe and Tom Dentici purchased Kuhn's Market from its founder Joseph Kuhn, who owned and operated the small grocery on Perrysville Avenue since 1939. As of August 2019, the company owns and operates eight full-service stores and employs more than 800 workers in the greater Pittsburgh area. Still owned by the same family that started the business in 1967, the chain has stores in the neighborhoods of Allison Park, Banksville, Bellevue, Wilkins Twp. (Beulah), North Side (Highwood), Hopewell Twp.(Aliquippa), Ingomar (McCandless), and McKnight (Ross Twp.). The company uses SuperValu as its supplier. The company's slogan is \\"A Pittsburgh Tradition\\".  Expansion and Decline  Since acquiring the first Kuhn's Market in 1967, the chain grew to five locations by 1992. In 2006, Kuhn's acquired two Shop 'n Save stores from SuperValu. A Kuhn's store left vacant when the former Shop 'N Save stores were acquired was leased in 2009 by Big Lots, a discount retailer.(\\"Two Shop 'n Save grocery stores in Ross and Cranberry will become Kuhn's Quality Foods stores by next week.\\") A tenth store was slated to open in the Hill District. Kuhn's Markets spokesman Dan Sakala declined to discuss the development, but Urban Redevelopment Authority spokeswoman in Pittsburgh, Megan Stearman said Joe Dentici, one of the owners, has cancer. Kuhn's Markets has blamed \\"economic\\" reasons as to why it has pulled out of the development. Kuhn's would have been the first grocer in 30 years to be in the region. Since 2009, Kuhn's has closed locations due to continued increase in the competitive landscape. Management at a recent store closure in Moon Township, PA claimed that the chain was unable to compete with Walmart.  Employee relations  Prior to 2009, none of Kuhn's markets were represented by a trade union, but instead by a company-sponsored \\"Employee Council\\". Each store has a representative that discusses employee issues such as pay rates, disagreements, and the like. A former Foodland location (Beulah) acquired in 2009 that was represented by United Food and Commercial Workers Local 23 continues to represent the employees, as required by law.

At a late stage the Aero Club chose to enter the more promising RAE Hurricane instead, using the Zephyr's engine, and the Zephyr itself was abandoned. Design and development The Zephyr was the first of three light aircraft designed and built by the Aero Club of the RAE. It was designed by Samuel Childs. As the Club originally considered it as an entrant to the Lympne Motor Glider Competition where the Daily Mail prize of ¬£1000 for a 50-mile flight was limited to aircraft with engines of less than 750 cc capacity, it was fitted with a 600 cc Douglas flat-twin engine that produced only about 20 hp (15 kW).According to Jackson, the engine was a 500 cc unit and by implication not the one used in the Hurricane. Ord-Hume states the same engine was used, but puts the power at 17 hp for the Zephyr and 21.5 hp for the Hurricane The Zephyr was a two bay biplane with wings without stagger or sweep and of constant chord with square tips. It was a pusher design, reminiscent of the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E series, for example the FE8, with a full fuselage replaced with a pod or nacelle with the cockpit and the engine behind it, the empennage supported on an open frame. The Zephyr's pilot sat under the front wing with a long but downward sloping nose ahead of him. Four booms ran rearwards from the wings, two on each side converging in the vertical plane from the inner interplane struts to the tail, with rectangular bracing to stiffen them. The tailplane was mounted at the meeting of the booms and twin triangular fins, each bearing a near rectangular rudder were placed at the ends of each vertical pair of booms. The twin-wheeled main undercarriage was supplemented by twin sprung tails skids, one under each fin. The Zephyr flew for the first time with Paul Bulman in control on 3 September 1923, with just over a month before the start of the Lympne Trials on 8 October. It was certainly later than intended, for the Zephyr had been registered as a competitor in the Vauvilles (near Cherbourg) Light Plane and Glider event which ended on 26 August.The Vauvilles entrants Flight 16 August 1923 The first flight went well, and Bulman reported excellent handling.Flight 13 September 1923 However, by this time the Aero Club had designed and built the much more modern looking Hurricane, a cantilever monoplane with less air resistance and slightly lower weight, though no lightweight. The Zephyr was therefore even more underpowered than the Hurricane, and it was decided to put the Douglas engine into the latter aircraft and enter it for the trials. The wing area of the biplane was more than three times that of the Hurricane, making for such a low wing loading (2.54 b/sq. ft. or 12.4 kg/m2) that the Zephyr would have been hard to fly except in a dead calm. With the loss of its engine the sole Zephyr, registeredCAA registration of G-EBGW G-EBGW was abandoned, though not destroyed until 1925.

Walsh has a Catholic church with a nearby cemetery, and there is a Lutheran church about to the west. The town of Porterfield's town hall and fire station are located in Walsh. Name The community was originally known as Rawnsville in the nineteenth century. It was named for the family of Jacob Rawn (1819‚Äì1896; surname earlier spelled Rein, Raan, or Rhyne),Rawn family genealogy who settled in the area. The name was changed to Walsh on July 5, 1902. The new name honored John R. Walsh (1837‚Äì1911) of Chicago. Walsh was the founder of the Chicago National Bank, and he purchased a controlling interest in the Wisconsin & Michigan Railway in October 1900. History A post office was established in Rawnsville (later Walsh) in 1881 but discontinued in 1882. The post office was reestablished in 1902 and operated until 1928. Rawnsville was the first stop north of Bagley Junction on the Wisconsin & Michigan (W. & M.) Railway line to Iron Mountain. The rail line was built in 1894 using surplus rail from the Chicago World's Fair, which had closed in 1893. The line was used to ship logs south to the mills in Marinette and Menominee, and it also offered passenger service. In the 1920s, the railroad owner John Marsch (1869‚Äì1954) operated a gravel pit with its own narrow-gauge railroad with a saddle tank locomotive next to the W. & M. line in Walsh. Gravel from the pit was delivered to Iron Mountain and then used to build the Ford Motor Company factory in nearby Kingsford. Gravel from Walsh was also used in the construction of U.S. Route 2 in Norway, Michigan. The rail line through Walsh was discontinued in 1938, when Marsch had the tracks torn out and the rolling stock sold off.

According to 11th-century accounts, it was located north of Constantinople, just outside the Blachernae walls. Competing accounts place it seaward of the Golden Gate. The place was loved by Justinian and Theodora, and served as a spring or summer retreat for the Byzantine emperors after them. The 6th-century historian Procopius describes it as \\"A luxuriant forest of cypresses, verdant and flowery slopes, a spring noiselessly pouring forth its calm and refreshing waters, these are the features which beseem that sacred spot.\\" Near the centre of the plain is the spring called the Life- giving Spring (ŒñœâŒøŒ¥œåœáŒøœÇ Œ†Œ∑Œ≥ŒÆ, Zoodochos Pege). When it was reported that a blind man had been restored to sight at the touch of its waters, Leo the Thracian erected a church over the spring. Justinian, believing that a bath in the spring had cured him of calculus, thriftily enlarged the church by means of the superfluous material that remained after the completion of Hagia Sophia. Twice destroyed by earthquake, it was successively rebuilt by Irene of Athens, wife of Leo IV, in the 8th century, and by Basil I one hundred years later. The Bulgarian Tsar Simeon, during one of his raids in the early 10th century, burnt it to the ground, and on his departure it was restored with added splendor by Romanos I Lekapenos. A generation later King Peter, the son of Simeon, wedded at its altar the granddaughter of that same Romanos. There too was solemnized the still more brilliant wedding of the youthful Emperor John V, and Helena, the bewitching daughter of John VI Kantakouzenos. Near the church was the Palace of the Pege, or of the Spring, to which the emperors annually removed on Ascension Day, and where they devoted a few weeks to their health. During the Second Crusade, King Louis VII of France and his wife, Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine, were for several weeks lodged there. Not a vestige of the palace exists. Here were the headquarters of Ottoman Sultan Murad II during his unsuccessful three months' siege of Constantinople in 1422. The church was greatly injured at the time, but not entirely destroyed until after the victory of Mehmed II. The site of the church (nowadays the suburb of Balƒ±klƒ±) remained in Greek Orthodox hands throughout the Ottoman period, becoming the site of a patriarchal hospital in the 18th century. The church was destroyed again by Janissaries in 1825, and rebuilt in 1833. The cemetery of the church serves as the principal Orthodox cemetery of the city, housing the tombs of many patriarchs.

The hotel was built in the 1880s and operated continuously until May 24, 2009, reopening after change of ownership and renovation on October 29, 2010. The Green Park Inn is a member of Historic Hotels of America, the official program of the National Trust for Historic Preservation for recognizing and celebrating the finest historic hotels across America. Past guests of the hotel have included John D. Rockefeller, Herbert Hoover, Annie Oakley, Calvin Coolidge, Eleanor Roosevelt and Margaret Mitchell among others. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on June 3, 1982. It is located in the Green Park Historic District. In the latter part of the Civil War a small fortification was built on the site of the Green Park by Federal Troops. The hotel is purported to be haunted, and has played host over the years to several conventions of ghost hunters. In the face of a difficult economy, the Green Park Inn was closed seeking a new buyer in 2009, and foreclosed later that year. On March 31, 2010, The Green Park Inn was purchased by two New York real estate investors who were already the owners of a number of other hotel properties. The new owners worked extensively with the Blowing Rock Historical Society and the State Historic Preservation authority in order to the retain charm, character, and historical integrity of the property. Just off the Lobby is the History Room which recounts the Hotel's storied past and contains the original Green Park U.S. Post Office. Following an aggressive renovation of the property, The Green Park Inn reopened to the public on October 29, 2010. During the refurnishing, the owners purchased only American made products. On July 1, 2011, the Green Park Inn reopened the Laurel Room Restaurant (now named the Chestnut Grille, to hone the American Chestnut from which the hotel is primarily constructed) and the Divide Tavern (so named as it straddles the Eastern Continental Divide) following a gut renovation of the hotel's kitchen facilities. The new food and beverage operations was headed by James Beard award-winning Chef James Welch. On October 29, 2011, the Green Park Inn celebrated its first anniversary of reopening after having a progressively successful year. In 2016, the hotel celebrated its 125th anniversary at a gala dinner and dance celebrating a milestone for the state's second oldest operating resort hotel and the last of the \\"Grand Manor\\" hotels still operating in western North Carolina. Included among the guests were descendants of two of the three hotels founders, the Bernhardt family and the Harper family. References * Winston-Salem Journal (July 31, 2009).

Its 19th- century growth was encouraged by the development of turnpikes and stagecoach routes to London and nearby towns. By the middle of that century railway services improved journey times and conditions significantly. Suburbanisation in the 20th century was assisted by a network of bus routes. Road A Compass Travel service in Worthing town centre Coastliner route 700 The Stagecoach in the South Downs office and bus depot on Marine Parade Worthing is served by several major roads. The A24 runs to Horsham, Dorking, Leatherhead and London; the A27 serves Brighton and Portsmouth; and the A259 runs along the coast to Littlehampton, Chichester, Brighton, Hastings and Folkestone. The A27's predecessor was the Roman road between Chichester and Brighton. The present route, south of this ancient road, became established in the 17th century. The borough has a road network of more than . Worthing's remoteness from London and the major roads and coach routes of Sussex was alleviated in 1803, when a turnpike was opened between the seafront and West Grinstead via Findon. A tollgate stood near the present Teville Gate shopping centre between 1804 and 1845. Other tollgates in Goring, Heene and East Worthing served later turnpikes in those areas. Until 1803, the nearest boarding point for stagecoaches was Steyning, but coaches ran regularly to London soon after the turnpike opened. The initial service of three per week in summer only was upgraded to a daily service all year, leaving at 7.00am. The journey took about seven hours and cost 11/- (¬£ as of ) for an uncovered seat. Coaches also ran to Brighton and Arundel, and by 1832 there were 24 departures and arrivals daily, serving destinations all over the south of England. James Town, who was closely involved with the early-19th-century coaching industry, became Worthing's leading horse-bus operator in the late 19th century, after the success of the railway caused coaching to decline. Other businessmen provided competition, and by 1900 horse-drawn buses served all parts of the town. From 1904, motorised buses superseded these: the Sussex Motor Road Car Company and its successor the Worthing Motor Omnibus Company ran local and long-distance from garages near the railway station. By 1909, Worthing Motor Services Ltd had formed; their fleet was 15 strong. Southdown Motor Services, formed in 1915 and later nationalised, survived with that identity until deregulation in 1986, after which Stagecoach Group acquired its routes and fleet. An experimental \\"tramocar\\" service was started in 1924. This used small single-decker vehicles manufactured by Shelvoke and Drewry. The first tramocars had solid wheels, open sides and a tiller instead of a conventional steering wheel; later models were fully enclosed and had pneumatic tyres. The initial service along the promenade was provided by two vehicles, but by the time Southdown Motor Services took over Tramocars Ltd's operations in 1938 there were 15 tramocars and a network of routes across Worthing. The last vehicle was withdrawn from service in 1942. A bureaucratic oversight meant that the borough council passed a bill to allow the development of a tramway network in Worthing. Between 1901 and 1903, The British Electric Traction Company sought permission to open tram routes between Hove, Worthing and Littlehampton. The council passed a bill to prevent this by ensuring that only they could authorise such a development, although they had no intention of doing so. The bill was never repealed. In the early 21st century longer-distance routes to Midhurst, Brighton and Portsmouth, were run by Stagecoach's South Downs division. Metrobus operated a route to Crawley. Other bus operators in the area included Worthing-based Compass Travel, Brighton & Hove Bus and Coach Company and Worthing Coaches, a division of haulage and travel company Lucketts Travel Group. Day trips and longer holidays by coach, and private hire of vehicles, are offered. Rail The 1909 buildings at Worthing railway station West Worthing's Italianate station building The borough of Worthing has five railway stations. From east to west, these are East Worthing, Worthing, West Worthing, Durrington-on-Sea and Goring-by-Sea. All are on the West Coastway Line, which takes a straight east‚Äìwest route through the area, and all are managed and operated by the Southern train operating company. East Worthing opened in September 1905 as Ham Bridge Halt and was renamed in 1949. It retained a ticket office until the 1990s, but is now unstaffed. The town's main station, Worthing (formerly Worthing Central), is west. It was opened on 24 November 1845, but the present structure dates from 1909. The old station building, further east, was preserved and is now listed at Grade II. West Worthing station, a further on, opened in 1889 to serve new residential development north of Heene. The main building is Italianate. Before Durrington-on-Sea, another west, are train carriage stabling facilities, sheds and sidings. Durrington-on-Sea, which was almost renamed Field Place in 1947 in reference to an 18th-century house nearby, opened in 1937. Goring-by-Sea is further west and dates from 1846. All stations have frequent daily services provided by Southern, to destinations such as London, Croydon, Gatwick Airport, Brighton, Chichester, Portsmouth and Southampton. Worthing station also receives occasional long-distance trains operated by Great Western Railway. Rail travel became quicker and more convenient from 1 January 1933, when the route between West Worthing and Brighton was electrified. Electric trains reached Durrington and Goring in 1938. Freight traffic has declined in importance, but Worthing, West Worthing and Goring had goods yards until the 1960s; West Worthing's supported the town's market gardening industry for many years. There are plans for Worthing to have a direct hourly link to the international station at London St Pancras and on to Cambridge as part of the ¬£5 billion Thameslink Programme. Originally envisaged to be completed in 2000, the project is now provisionally scheduled to be completed in 2015. Cycle Worthing is on National Cycle Network Route 2, which will run along the English Channel coast from Dover in Kent to St Austell in Cornwall. As of 2009, it is incomplete and does not run west of the town. The section from Brighton is partly traffic-free and follows the coast for most of its length. In August 2009, local byelaws were changed to support a year-long trial allowing cyclists to use a section of the seafront promenade. Public consultation suggested that residents were generally in favour of the scheme, but the absence of a speed limit and the lack of segregation between pedestrians and cyclists proved controversial. Air Shoreham Airport is the closest airport to Worthing. The closest airport to Worthing for light aircraft is Shoreham Airport, about to the east in the district of Adur. It was the first licensed airfield in Britain when it opened in 1911. In 1933 it was bought by a committee, redesignated the Brighton, Hove and Worthing Municipal Airport, and opened under this name on 13 June 1936. London Gatwick Airport is about away. Seaplanes often took off from Worthing beach in the early 20th century.

The location also has a camp used by the Sami people, and there is even a mountain cabin and Caravan camp run by the Svenska Turistf√∂reningen.http://www.svenskaturistforeningen.se/sv/upptack/Omraden/Lappland/Fjallstugor/STF- Fjallstuga-ritsem/ The cabin is mostly used by tourists who are traveling to/from Northern Padjelanta and Northern Sarek and are using the ferry (run by Svenska Turistf√∂reningen) across Akkajaure. Ritsem is located near the Stora Sj√∂fallet National Park. There is a regular bus line between Ritsem and G√§llivare during both summer and winter. Climate Ritsem has a subarctic climate that is significantly moderated by the North Atlantic Current outside of the nearby Norwegian coastline. As a result, summers are chilly and winters cold, but not severely cold when compared to areas on such northerly latitudes elsewhere in the world. Given its very high latitude, Ritsem sees a long midnight sun period in summer, whereas a shorter polar night period with significant twilight hours occurs in winter. Due to the low sun however, summers can see frost well inside the midnight sun period. Ritsem's all-time record is lower than any other of the 100 stations featured in the national weather service's monthly reports. It does have to be taken into account that these records only date back to 1981. By the time Atlantic depressions set in during late autumn, temperatures are far milder in Ritsem than further east and even further south in the country. Days above freezing are common throughout November. The ensuing winters very seldom see temperatures fall below , unlike in the aforementioned areas. Even though the maritime air is strong during winter, precipitation in form of snow is normally not extreme in raw content, although large snowpacks form due to the lack of thaws.

Lorenzo Jones was a daytime radio series which aired on NBC in different timeslots over an 18-year span. Produced by Frank and Anne Hummert, the series could be classified with its own unique category of \\"comedy soap opera\\", highlighted by organist Rosa Rio's rollicking rendition of the opening theme music, \\"Funiculi, Funicula\\". During the early 1950s, the 15-minute program served as a comedy lead-in to Bob and Ray. Each episode opened with this introduction: :We all know couples like lovable, impractical Lorenzo Jones and his devoted wife, Belle. Lorenzo's inventions have made him a character to the town, but not to Belle, who loves him. Their struggle for security is anybody's story, but somehow, with Lorenzo, it has more smiles than tears... and now, let's smile awhile with Lorenzo Jones and his wife, Belle. Characters and story The daydreaming Lorenzo Jones (Karl Swenson) was employed as an auto mechanic at a garage owned by Jim Barker (John Brown, Frank Behrens). Barker's wife Irma (Mary Wickes, Grace Keddy, Nancy Sheridan) had her own opinions about Lorenzo's inventions. Lorenzo's friend Sandy Matson (Joseph Julian) listened patiently as Lorenzo told him how fame and fortune were just around the corner, even though Lorenzo's dreams and schemes rarely surfaced in the marketplace. However, his wife Belle (Betty Garde, Lucille Wall) always remained faithful as Lorenzo devised such curiosities as an outdoor vacuum cleaner and a teapot with three spouts (for strong, medium and weak tea). Lorenzo and Belle were able to buy their rented house after his invention of an automatic foot-warmer became a success, bringing them $2500. During the early 1950s, when science fiction became increasingly popular, Lorenzo spent many days attempting to construct a rocket ship in his basement. As time passed, the plots became a bit more like conventional soap operas, notably during a story arc in which Lorenzo was kidnapped by jewel thieves, received a blow to the head and wandered about with amnesia for more than a year. Program The program was launched by NBC at 4 pm on April 26, 1937, airing in that time period until the following year. In 1938‚Äì39, it was heard at 11:15 am, moving to 4:30 pm (1939‚Äì51), then to 5:30 pm (1951-54), concluding the series run at 5:15 pm (1954‚Äì55). From 1937 to 1949, the sponsors were Phillips Milk of Magnesia and Bayer Aspirin, followed by Procter & Gamble (1949‚Äì55). The show was scripted by Ted Ferro (who also collaborated on the Barnaby comic strip in 1946-47) and his wife, Mathilde Ferro. The announcers were Don Lowe, Norman Sweetser and George Putnam. Directors included Stephen Gross and Ernest Ricca. This show is widely acclaimed in the novel In Country. Cultural legacy Lorenzo Jones served as an example of an inventor in the oral arguments of the 2009 Supreme Court case in re Bilski.

However, the co-producer was Milton Subotsky of Amicus.Ed. Allan Bryce, Amicus: The Studio That Dripped Blood, Stray Cat Publishing, 2000 p 153-154 The film was a British-Canadian co- production shot on-location in Montreal and Senneville, Quebec, and Pinewood Studios in England. In the UK, the film was originally given an X-rating. Plot In 1977, in Montreal, writer Wilbur Gray visits his publisher Frank Richards to discuss his new book about cats. Wilbur believes that felines are supernatural creatures, and that they are the devil in disguise. Wilbur tells three tales to illustrate his thoughts: In 1912, in London, Miss Malkin is a wealthy woman who rewrites her will leaving her fortune to her cats rather than to her nephew Michael. Her maid Janet, also the mistress of Michael, steals one copy of the will from the lawyer's briefcase and tries to destroy the original copy which is kept in the safe. When Miss Malkin sees her attempt, Janet kills her. The cats avenge Miss Malkin's death. In 1975, in the Province of Quebec, the orphan Lucy comes to live with her aunt Mrs. Blake, her husband, and her cousin Angela after the death of her parents in a plane crash. Lucy brings her only friend, the cat Wellington, but her mean cousin forces her parents to get rid of Wellington. Lucy uses her mother's book of witchcraft to avenge Wellington. In 1936, in Hollywood, the actor Valentine De'ath replaces the blade of a fake pendulum to kill his actress wife, and give his young mistress and aspiring actress Edina a chance.

History Kingsley-Smith and Associates Kingsley-Smith and Associates (KSA) was formed in 1972, initially as a full software service company comprising five people serving manufacturing, banks and insurance companies within the UK. By 1973, the company had expanded to around twenty personnel, and begun to focus on UK banks and foreign banks which had operational activities in London. KSA realised a gap existed in packaged software aimed specifically at banks, at the same time as IBM released its System/32, later known as IBM 5320, as a new small PC system which could easily be programmed in RPG. The original five Kingsley-Smith and Associates members were Brian Kingsley-Smith, David Eley, David Mitchell, David Shaw, and David Harington. Initial development The MIDAS banking system was designed in 1975 at Kingsley Smith and Associates by Barrington (Barry) Fludgate. It was the brainchild of Achie Reid a then director of KSA. The system was originally going to be called FALCON, since SWIFT had just been announced, but at the last minute was changed to MIDAS (Modular International Dealing and Accounting System), the name was suggested by Jeremy Blackman, one of the two original programmers on the development. The development phase consisted of three people, Barry (designer and architect), Jeremy (technical programmer) and John Gilbert (business programmer) The system was built for the newly announced IBM System 32 in RPGII. The first sale was made to Australia and New Zealand Bank in early 1976 and was installed and running live in their New York office in the summer of 1976. The KSA development of MIDAS banking system had nothing to do with the Management Information Distributor Accounting System (MIDAS) software system created by David Shaw in 1972 for Jaguar Rover Triumph. BIS Banking Systems In 1976 KSA and Midas was sold to the BIS Group. The company was called BIS Software and the main office was in Lincolns Inn Fields with software development based at York House near Waterloo; convenient for the City. The Managing Director of BIS Software was John Prosser with the charismatic Stan Smith as the Sales Director. David Tebbs (see ITNEA) became CEO in 1983 and later moved the business to Wimbledon and the company was renamed BIS Banking Systems. In 1988 the BIS Group was bought by Nynex, an offshoot of the recently demerged AT&T;, and by this time the Midas banking packages supplied 900+ of the world's 1,000 largest banks. Leadership phase 70s and 80s Midas became the standard package for banks off shore operations (and some domestic wholesale banking operations) worldwide by the end of the 1970s, and thanks to that early leadership it has been argued that Midas is (or was) the world's most successful banking system. In the 1970s and 1980s the Midas family of banking- packages led the market with more worldwide customers, more awards, and more capability than any other. Thanks to the inertia of banks, 10 year renewals and cost of migration by some accounts it could claim to have kept this leadership position into the 1990s. The system had broader functionality (and sometimes deeper) than most of the packages initially available on packaged systems. It reduced risks bringing efficiency due to a fairly standardised and comparatively automated process cycle. Offshore expansion 1990s In 1990 BIS opened an offshore maintenance center in Makati City, Philippines. This pioneering move in the banking software industry was not capitalized on quickly and for the next decade the location was little more than a coding shop taking orders from the UK. It did however provide a cheap pool of resources amenable to spending months/years on site coding modifications and fixes. By the end of the decade no two Midas user sites ran the same code base and Midas maintained large staff numbers in most financial centers. In 1993 BIS Banking Systems was purchased by ACT ACT which had previously purchased Kindle Banking Systems and a handful of other banking applications. The organisation was fragmented with some parts of the organisation called ACT International and some labelled ACT Financial Systems. In 1994 ACT bought Kapiti Ltd, who owned the Equation product line. The IBM AS/400 based products, Equation from Kapiti and Midas from ACT/BIS were united into the Midas Kapiti International (MKI) business. Technical and functional comparisons between Midas and Equation followed. It was no surprise that Equation had zoomed past Midas in terms of core banking functionality (payments, lending, customer management, deposits, tellering), but it was something of a shock for the Midas team to see how the Midas user interface, the flat file data base and the system architecture in general had fallen behind Equation - and by implication fallen behind other competitors. Multiple Midas catch up projects followed to retro fit basic features like product templates, customer centric banking and application program interfaces (API's) into the aging platform. The federated Midas data base however was considered beyond redemption and remains fragmented and poorly documented. Midas has a very broad coverage of banking business areas. In the 70s and 80s it had provided market leading functionality in several of those areas. However, in the late 1990s other packaged systems within Misys and from other vendors caught up with and overtook Midas in areas like retail banking, customer and party management, work flow and most significantly treasury. Despite this in the early 1990s Midas maintained a leadership position or close to leadership position in terms of annual new names sales and installed base size. Misys International Banking Systems ‚Äì decline On 1 October 2001, Midas-Kapiti International [MKI] was renamed as Misys International Banking Systems. The new name formed part of an extensive re-branding exercise undertaken by the company, which also embraced sister companies MKI Frustum and the Credo Group, becoming unified under the new brand name. Midas had built up an impressive user base of international branch banking and treasury operations in the previous decades. Treasury focused users in the Midas user base came under attack from cheaper Windows and Unix based systems with better coverage of the newer classes of financial instruments like derivatives. Although Midas had some retail functionality the Midas team underestimated the complexity of retail banking software, importance of work flow and automation resulting in the stalling of multiple Midas retail banking initiatives. Overall the Midas customer numbers were in decline. In the late 1990s Midas was the first core banking system to introduce global processing to the core banking industry but this did nothing to stop the decline. Misys 2010 onwards ‚Äì stasis Two technology refreshes Midas Plus and BankFusion Midas have staunched the flow of defections from the existing user base and some existing user banks are expanding usage of the system. However, there have been very few new name users signed in recent years, nonetheless the legacy installed base is still large compared to most competitor system when measured by numbers of banks, user banks profiles and the re-occurring revenue stream..

Toner cartridges contain toner powder, a fine, dry mixture of plastic particles, carbon, and black or other coloring agents that make the actual image on the paper. The toner is transferred to paper via an electrostatically charged drum unit, and fused onto the paper by heated rollers during the printing process. It will not stain like ink cartridges, but it can get messy if handled improperly.  Variants  Low-end to mid-range laser printers typically contain two consumable parts: the toner cartridge itself (which has a typical life of 2,000 pages) and the drum unit (a typical life of 40,000 pages). Some toner cartridges incorporate the drum unit in the design, and both drum and cartridge are replaced simultaneously; cost of a cartridge is higher than a toner-only cartridge, although separate drum replacement is avoided. Toner cartridges have the same function as ink cartridges used by inkjet printers.  Price  The price of printer manufacturers' toner cartridges for the cheapest laser printers can exceed the cost of the printer. These cheap printers often come with cartridges containing much less toner than the standard cartridge, quickly requiring replacement. Many companies make generic replacement toner cartridges, sold at much lower prices than the original cartridges. The cartridges may be new or remanufactured (refilled), and the quality varies. There are also toner refill kits, allowing the user to refill an empty cartridge.  Yield  Page yield is the number of pages that can be printed with a cartridge. Estimated yield is a number published by manufacturers to provide consumers with an idea of how many pages they can expect from a cartridge. For many years, manufacturers developed their own methods for testing and reporting the yields of their toner cartridges, making it difficult for customers to compare products. In June 2004, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), in conjunction with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), published the ISO/IEC 19752 yield standard for monochrome toner cartridges. This was followed in December 2006 by new standards for color inkjet cartridges (ISO/IEC 24711) and color toner cartridges (ISO/IEC 19798). ISO yield may differ considerably from user experience, proportionally to the difference between the real use of the printer and ISO standard test pages and conditions.  Cartridge types   OEM  Cartridges made by the printer manufacturer are referred to by brandname or as \\"original equipment manufacturer\\" (OEM); they are often described as \\"genuine\\". Manufacturers warn about the poor quality of third- party cartridges‚Äîwhich their suppliers deny‚Äîsometimes stating that their use will void the printer warranty. OEM toner cartridges are more expensive than refilled, compatible, or re-manufactured cartridges.  Compatible  \\"Compatible\\", \\"generic\\", or \\"alternative brand\\" are cartridges manufactured by third party companies and sold under different brand names. Compatible cartridges may vary slightly in look, design and page yield to their OEM counterparts, sometimes due to patents or design copyrights. Generic cartridges are cheaper, often significantly so, than original manufacturer cartridges. They may be less reliable, depending upon the manufacturer. Some contain more toner than OEM cartridges, printing more pages. Some compatible toner cartridges may be of similar quality to their OEM competitors, but many are not. Problems with compatible toners may be caused by various factors including different melting points, different electrostatic qualities, different pigments and different particle sizes, any of which can lead to poor print quality, dirty background or in extreme cases, damage to equipment.  Remanufactured  Remanufacturing is, at least, refilling a cartridge with toner. The term implies that the cartridge is also refurbished, with worn or damaged parts replaced.Uninet: Remanufacturing the Brother HL23xx cartridge The remanufacturing process, and the quality of the toner, differs between remanufacturers. A poorly remanufactured (or newly manufactured) cartridge may leak, malfunction, or damage the printer. Printer manufacturers use a toner designed to be suitable for their printers; remanufactured and third-party cartridges may use a generic toner which is less well matched. While toner cartridges are commonly refilled with results reported to be good, in at least some cases this may leave waste toner from each print and paper debris in the cartridge, potentially causing backgrounding problems and producing contamination in the refilled cartridge. On March 28, 1989, Fred Keen was granted a United States Patent for the \\"Refillable Toner Cartridge.\\" U.S. Patent Office: Refillable toner cartridge and method of manufacture thereof  Availability  Remanufactured, compatible, OEM and refilled toner cartridges are available from a variety of sources across the world. While compatible and OEM cartridges can be purchased off-the-shelf, smaller remanufacturers may refill an empty cartridge supplied by a customer. Larger remanufacturers used to collect old, empty and unused cartridges for recycling but nowadays they manufacturer theirs. On average, up to 90% of components from old cartridges can be salvaged and used in remanufactured cartridges, while the other 10% is broken down for recycling. Remanufacturers will put together countless cartridges (OEM and compatible) and sell to the retail market at discounted rates.  Sustainability  Each brand new toner cartridge requires the burning of over two quarts of petroleum in the manufacturing process. In North America alone, more than 200 million litres of petroleum are used to sustain the production of new toner cartridges with the majority of these cartridges ending up in the worlds landfills once empty. Manufactures have responded by developing recycling programs for their used cartridges. Advocates of more environmentally friendly processes claim that using refilled and remanufactured toner cartridges are much more environmentally friendly than using brand name new cartridges. Refilled and remanufactured cartridges reduce the dependency on petroleum that otherwise would have been used in the manufacture process of the new cartridge.

He entered the Confederate States Army on the promise that the Confederacy would support an Indian state if it won the war, and achieved the rank of colonel. He served as delegate from the Nation to Washington, DC during the 1860s and 1870s. Born in the traditional Cherokee territory in Georgia, he traveled as a child with his family on the Trail of Tears of Indian Removal from the Southeast to Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). Background William Penn Adair was born on April 15, 1830, in the old Cherokee Nation in New Echota, Georgia. His parents were George Washington Adair (1806-1862) and Martha (n√©e Martin) Adair. The family was forced to remove to Indian Territory in 1838, a process which their people called the Trail of Tears, because of the loss of their lands and the high number of deaths along the way. Adair attended Cherokee schools in Indian Territory, and studied law. He became a Freemason,Littlefield and Parins, 165 belonging to the Vinita Lodge No. 5, which was chartered in 1875.Starr, 185 He was described as being \\"six foot and two inches in height, magnetic, logical and frankly agreeable, the ablest and most brilliant of all Cherokees.\\"Starr, 264 Adair married Sarah Ann McNair. After her death, he married again, to Susannah \\"Sue\\" McIntosh Drew.Starr, 328 He lived on land along the Grand River in what is now Adair, Oklahoma. It was named for him. Military service During the Civil War, Adair served in the Confederate States Army, first in the First Regiment of Cherokee Mounted Volunteers, under General Stand Watie.Betty Lou Harper Thomas, \\"Adair.\\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, Accessed 24 March 2010 The Confederacy had promised the nations in Indian territory that it would support an Indian-controlled state if it won the war. Adair rose to the rank of colonel and organized the Second Cherokee Mounted Volunteers.Starr, 148 Tribal leadership Adair served the Cherokee Nation in many capacities. He was a senator, a justice of the Cherokee Supreme Court, delegate to Washington, DC, and assistant principal chief. He served as the Senator from the Flint District from 1855-1860Starr, 272 and Senator from the Saline District from 1869-1874.Starr, 267 In 1879, he was elected as Assistant Chief. Throughout the 1860s and 1870s, Adair served as a delegate from the Cherokee Nation to Washington.Starr, 296 He was a vocal advocate for the rights of the Texas Cherokees. He served as Chairman of the Texas Cherokees and Affiliated (later Associate) Bands from 1871 until his death in 1880. During this period in 1873, he and Clement Neely Vann co-authored the book, History of the Claim of the Texas Cherokees, which they wrote on behalf of \\"the Texas Cherokees and Affiliated Bands.\\"Adair and Vann, 1 The Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands was established by Adair and John Adair Bell in the early 1850s in the Mount Tabor Indian Community in Rusk County, Texas for the purposes of seeking redress over the violations of the 1836 Treaty of Bowles Village which later led to the Cherokee-Texas war in 1839 as well as later actions by Texas Cherokee leader Chicken Trotter until the Treaty of Birds Fort in 1843 that ended hostilities. The Texas Cherokee continued to seek compensation from the state of Texas for lands taken from them in 1839. Adair along with other Confederate Cherokees went to Washington in order to petition Congress to allow him to sue the state to return lands in Texas once belonging to Texas Cherokee people. Initially this was to allow Southern Cherokees to relocate back on treaty lands due to the hostilities of Cherokee factions after the war. Some of these issues went back to the Ross-Ridge party feuds stemming from the Trail of Tears that had been played out during the Civil War. The main point for the suit was that in 1839, while the Republic of Texas was independent, President Mirabeau Lamar had forcibly driven most of the Texas Cherokee into Indian Territory and seized their lands in East Texas. The Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands sought the return of in East Texas.Chief Bowles and the Texas Cherokees by Mary Whatley Clarke, pages 121-125 In the 1850s the state had offered lands in the Texas Panhandle in exchange, but Adair refused to accept that offer.\\"Cherokee Indians\\", Handbook of Texas Online. (retrieved 24 March 2010) No such offer was made to settle after that. However the Texas Cherokees and Associate Bands continued to pursue litigation as late as 1963 some eighty-three years after Adair's death. Death and legacy While in Washington, D.C., Adair died on October 23, 1880. He was initially buried in Arlington National Cemetery in Washington, D.C., but his body was soon thereafter transferred to the Tahlequah City Cemetery in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. This move was paid for by the Cherokee Nation. Several Cherokee boys were named after him in the late 19th century, including the celebrated Cherokee humorist William Penn Adair Rogers (better known as Will Rogers).Rogers et al, 83 Adair, Oklahoma was named for William Penn Adair and his brother, Dr. Walter Thompson Adair. In 1955, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum. Notes References Sources *Adair, William Penn and C. N. Vann.

Synopsis  Ku A-ming (Âè§ÈòøÊòé) is a fourth grader at Chungshan Elementary School in Shuiyu Township. Despite being not very good in most subjects at school, he is very talented in art and has a great imagination, though most teachers cannot understand what he's expressing in his artwork. During a morning assembly, a new art teacher named Mr. Kuo asks if anyone is interested in joining the after school art club. Ku A-ming was the first one to volunteer. During an art competition, the school teachers voted to decide a winner to represent the school in a nationwide competition; most voted the mayor's son for their own interests. Since A-ming lost, Mr. Kuo protested by quitting his job at the school. Before he leaves, he asked A-ming to give him one of his drawings. Sadly, after Mr. Kuo has left, A-ming dies of liver illness. Mr. Kuo sends A-ming's drawing to a worldwide children's art competition, with A-ming's winning as the champion. The teachers begin to regret for neglecting A-ming's great artistic talent.

In 1963, Michels began providing outside plant construction and installation of buried telephone cable systems. The company expanded again in 1970, forming a Sewer, Water and Tunnel Division.http://www.answers.com/topic/michels-corporation In 1976, Michels began producing crushed aggregates to supply materials for various road and building construction projects throughout eastern Wisconsin. The next year, 1977, Michels began constructing rural water distribution systems throughout the Northern Plains. As part of this development, the company constructed water mains, laterals and residential water service. Michels branched out into fiber optic cable systems in 1983. The company built customized equipment, including the design and fabrication of rail-mounted cable plows. In 1988, Michels began a new method known as horizontal directional drilling to construct underground utilities. The company expanded on this when it designed and manufactured the most powerful directional drilling rig to date in 1996. The rig was called \\"Hercules-1200\\" for its 1,200,000 pounds of push/pullback. Michels acquired Superior Electric Company of Appleton, Wisconsin, in 1997, and changed the name to Michels Power. The company also established Michels Directional Crossings Co. in Canada.

Early life He was born in 1889 as the youngest of nine children to Francisco Antonio Barandiaran and Mar√≠a Antonia Ayerbe in the family baserri Perune-Zarre in Ataun. Encouraged by his mother, he entered the priesthood aged 14 in Baliarrain and was ordained as a priest in 1914 in Burgos. Ordained a priest in 1914, the following year he obtained a degree in Theology. In 1916 he joined the Faculty of Philosophy of the Vitoria Seminary as a science professor, teaching the subjects of Physics and Chemistry, Geology, Human Paleontology, Prehistory and History of Religions. He lasted for twenty years as a professor, simultaneously exercising managerial positions such as that of vice-rector. Career as an ethnographer Soon after being ordained as a priest, he took up ethnographic studies of Basque culture and archeology around 1916 in the Aralar Mountains. He carried out invaluable research into folk traditions and collecting accounts and tales related to Basque mythology. His contribution to the paleontological study of the Basque people. Magismo, which presented in Bilbao in 1919, strongly interested the great ethnologist Wilhelm Schmidt, founder of the magazine Anthropos in Vienna. This offered him the position of correspondent for Spain and invited him to participate in the International Week of Religious Ethnology that was going to be celebrated in the Dutch town of Tilburg in 1922. There he delivered his communication . When the Spanish Civil War began, he had to go into exile in September 1936, considered a suspect simply because of his dedication to Basque culture.In 1953 he returned from exile and opened at the University of Salamanca, at the request of its rector, Don Antonio Tovar, the Larramendi Chair with a course on the current state of Basque studies. The following year, within the Aranzadi Science Society, he created the Ethnology Seminar and, after twenty years of interruption, in 1955, published volume XV of the Eusko Folklore Yearbook, with studies on pastoral and agricultural life followed by others dedicated to popular industries and crafts. Awards In 1989, he received the Gold Medal for Merit in Fine Arts from the Ministry of Education, Culture and Sports Ministry of Education, Spanish Culture and Sports.

History Both what is now Germany and Norway were settled by Proto-Germanic peoples. The Ahrensburg culture, named after the town of Ahrensburg in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein, originated mostly in the North German Plain and were the first known peoples to settle modern-day Norway. By the 2nd century AD, Proto-Norse devolved from Proto-Germanic in Scandinavia. This separated the West Germanic peoples (of whom Germans are associated) and the North Germanic (of whom the Norwegians are associated). A large collection of North German towns formed the Hanseatic League. A kontor was established in Bergen, which since became a major hub of trade with the Germans. The League issued a lot of loans to the Norwegian royalty; this is the long term indebted them, and Norway's economy and trade became subordinate to the League.

Frequently the term relates specifically to catalytic reaction systems where either a homogeneous or heterogeneous catalyst is present in the reactor. Sometimes a reactor per se is not present by itself, but rather is integrated into a process, for example in reactive separations vessels, retorts, certain fuel cells, and photocatalytic surfaces. The issue of solvent effects on reaction kinetics is also considered as an integral part. Origin of chemical reaction engineering Chemical reaction engineering as a discipline started in the early 1950s under the impulse of researchers at the Shell Amsterdam research center and the university of Delft. The term chemical reaction engineering was apparently coined by J.C. Vlugter while preparing the 1st European Symposium on Chemical Reaction Engineering which was held in Amsterdam in 1957. Discipline Chemical reaction engineering aims at studying and optimizing chemical reactions in order to define the best reactor design. Hence, the interactions of flow phenomena, mass transfer, heat transfer, and reaction kinetics are of prime importance in order to relate reactor performance to feed composition and operating conditions. Although originally applied to the petroleum and petrochemical industries, its general methodology combining reaction chemistry and chemical engineering concepts allows optimization of a variety of systems where modeling or engineering of reactions is needed. Chemical reaction engineering approaches are indeed tailored for the development of new processes and the improvement of existing technologies.

These three-day conferences are held every two years, rotating among sites in North America, Europe, and the Asia-Pacific region, on a six-year cycle. These conferences bring together for three days distinguished international researchers in reaction engineering, prominent industrial practitioners, and new researchers and students of this multifaceted field. ISCRE symposia are a unique gathering place for reaction engineers where research gains are consolidated and new frontiers explored.

History Historical connections Vikings of Norwegian stock particularly settled in certain areas of modern day Scotland and Northern England, and to this day many people in these areas carry surnames derived from Old Norse words, such as Ainscough, or are of partial Norwegian descent. In England, Norwegian Vikings began to arrive along the coast of the north west after being driven out of Ireland around the early 10th century. They are principally known for settling in The Wirral and Chester,https://www.british- history.ac.uk/vch/ches/vol5/pt1/pp16-33 but evidence has strongly suggested that this expulsion also led to some settling in nearby West Derby Hundred (today split between Greater Manchester and Merseyside), Amounderness Hundred and Lonsdale Hundred in Lancashire. The Vikings were able to settle comfortably in these areas, as they were sparsely populated at that time.https://thewildpeak.wordpress.com/2014/05/23/north-meols-and-the- scandinavian-settlement-of- lancashire/https://www.southportvisiter.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/new-book- shows-vikings-still-6610982http://www.martlet- books.co.uk/user/image/lonsdaletrail.pdf Many place names in this area, such as North Meols, Scholes,http://www.wiganarchsoc.co.uk/content/History/medieval_wigan.htm Skelmersdalehttp://www.cheshiretrove.com/current/history/vikings/index.html and Grimsargh are of Old Norse origin, as are certain words in Lancashire dialect from this area, such as \\"skrike\\". The Cuerdale Hoard and Silverdale Hoard were both discovered within this area. Around the same time, Norwegian Vikings moved on to settle in the area that today is Cumbria.http://www.english-lakes.com/history.html In Scotland, the islands of Shetland and Orkney have longstanding historical connections with Norway. 1900s Both countries established diplomatic relations in 1905, after Norway‚Äôs independence. The UK has an embassy in Oslo. Norway has an embassy in London. Relations, however, go as far back as the Viking Age when Norse Vikings raided the British Isles, founding permanent settlements in the west of England, Isle of Man, the Hebrides in Scotland and the islands of Orkney and Shetland. As a result, the English language has been greatly influenced by the Norwegian language. This cultural bond has persisted to this day, resulting in a close cultural relationship between the two countries. With Norway's complete independence from Sweden, the question arose as to a king for Norway. The choice of Prince Carl of Denmark, who became King Haakon VII, was largely seen as being influenced by two unusual factors: Denmark's being a smaller nation meant that the Balance of Power in Europe would not be upset by Norway's instant alliance with the native land of its new king, and Carl's wife, Maud, was a British princess, which would be expected to lead to a close relationship with the United Kingdom, which could give Norway some protection from German hegemony. During World War I, Norway was neutral. However, due to largely favouring the British over the Germans, Norway came to be known as The Neutral Ally. World War II The Trafalgar Square Christmas tree is donated to the people of London by the city of Oslo each year since 1947 During World War II, Norway was invaded and occupied by Germany, forcing the Norwegian king and government to create a government-in-exile in London. The British military also helped train and organize Norwegian commandos to attack Nazi installations in Norway. As a token of appreciation from the Norwegian people to the people of Britain, a Norwegian Christmas Tree is sent every year from Oslo to Trafalgar Square in London. Each year for the last 60 years Newcastle upon Tyne has received a Christmas tree as a gift from the people of Bergen, one of Newcastle‚Äôs twin cities. The impressive Norwegian spruce, standing at 45 feet tall, was personally felled by Gunnar Bakke who has been the mayor of Newcastle‚Äôs twin city since September 2007. Each year the tree is decorated in traditional Norwegian white lights and is a symbol of peace and goodwill. The people of Norway also send a tree to the town of Great Grimsby every Christmas since the end of World War II, for the past few years the tree has been selected by the people of Sortland. Brexit In January 2020, with the imminent departure of Britain from the EU, Norway and the UK signed an exclusive Brexit agreement between the two countries that would aim to maintain existing guarantees for citizens of either.https://www.newsinenglish.no/2020/01/28/norway-uk-sign-own-brexit-deal/ Modern Day British Foreign Secretary William Hague (right) and Norwegian Foreign Minister Jonas Gahr St√∏re sign a Memorandum of Understanding on UK- Norway co-operation on polar research and cultural heritage in London, England, on 30 November 2011. After the English town of Harwich was badly affected by the North Sea Flood of 1953, in which several people were made homeless, the Norwegian Government responded by funding the building of some wooden houses in the town. Despite being considered temporary, the houses still stand in Harwich today. Norway and the U.K. share mutual border boundary lines in Antarctica, and mutually recognise each other's claims as well as those of Australia, France and New Zealand. Both countries are full members of NATO and of the Council of Europe.

It was built by Nuuk-Kraft and it is operated by Nukissiorfiit - Greenland's national energy company. In 1984‚Äì85, Greenland's energy authority prepared a Greenland's hydroelectricity development program. At that time all electricity in Greenland was produced by oil based fuels, but there had been a sharp rise in the oil prices the preceding years. Construction of a plant in Buksefjord was proposed by a private consortium in 1988. In 1989, four companies were invited to a public tender. However, later it was decided that construction of the plant will be financed by the Home Rule of Greenland and the plant will be rented to Nuuk- Kraft consortium. Construction of the plant was approved by the Parliament of Greenland in 1990. It was commissioned in 1993. Unconventionally, the power station is situated inside a mountain and it consists of of tunnels. The upper reservoir, Kang Lake, is situated above sea level at Buksefjord. Due to damming and deep inlet, it has a total effective volume of , which is six times more than the annual water consumption by the plant. From the lake, a long inlet pressure tunnel runs down to the plant. Originally, the plant had two turbines with capacity of 15 MW each. In 2008, a third turbine with the same capacity was installed.

Harris is known best for penning The Southern Vampire Mysteries (also referred to as the True Blood Series), a series rich in supernatural characters such as vampires, telepaths, werewolves, shapeshifters and fairies; she has also written more traditional (non-paranormal) mysteries. The Harper Connelly Mysteries is also centered on a character with supernatural abilities, however these abilities are more subtle than in The Southern Vampire Mysteries. The series is narrated by 24-year-old Harper Connelly, who comes from a self-professed ‚Äúriches to rags‚Äù family. Her mother married a man when Harper was a teenager, and she acquired a step-brother, Tolliver, in the process. They watched their parents succumb to drugs and their family life reduced to nothing. At 15, Harper was struck by lightning, a life-altering event that left her with the unique ability to sense dead people. When near a dead person, she can hear a ‚Äúbuzzing sound‚Äù that intensifies if the death is more recent. Along with this ability, she can see how the person died, but in the case of murders, not the identity of the murderer. Intent on making the most of her situation, Harper and Tolliver (who has taken on the role of her manager) charge customers who are in need of her special talent. The Harper Connelly Novels # Grave Sight (October 2005), # Grave Surprise (October 2006), # An Ice Cold Grave (October 2007), # Grave Secret (October 2009), Characters Main characters Harper Connelly: The main character, Harper is 24 years old in the first novel of the series. As a result of being struck by lightning at the age of 15, Harper can find dead bodies by sensing a buzzing sound when they are near. In addition, she can see their cause of death. Tolliver Lang: Tolliver is Harper‚Äôs stepbrother, and is 28 years old in the first novel of the series. Harper‚Äôs mother married Tolliver‚Äôs father when Harper was a teenager and they have relied on each other for strength ever since. After Harper acquired her unique ability to sense the dead, Tolliver became her manager and travels with her, booking appointments with customers. There is a certain degree of sexual tension between Tolliver and Harper, and they both must deal with their feelings for each other as well as their status as stepsiblings. Recurring characters * Cameron Connelly: Harper's older sister who went missing at the age of 18. Harper dreams of one day finding her, although she is almost certain that she is dead. * Gracie : Harper and Tolliver's youngest sister. * Hank Gorham: Harper's uncle by his marriage to Iona Gorham. He is the adopted father of Mariella and Gracie. * Iona Gorham (n√©e Howe): Harper's maternal aunt. She is the adopted mother of Mariella and Gracie, and married to Hank Gorham. In Grave Sight (book 1), Hank and Iona are described as Tolliver's biological aunt and uncle, not Harper's. This changes in book 2. * Manfred Bernardo: A genuine psychic who appears in books 2‚Äì4 as a friend and colleague of Harper and Tolliver. He is the grandson of psychic Xylda Bernardo, and demonstrates a romantic interest in Harper. He plays a major role in the resolution of the storylines in An Ice Cold Grave, and Grave Secret. * Mariella: Harper and Tolliver's younger sister. There seem to be some inconsistencies in age though. In book 1, It states that she had just turned eleven and had run off. In book 2, it states that she was nine. * Mark Lang: Tolliver's older brother. He assumes a much larger role in the final book in the series, Grave Secret. * Matthew Lang: Father to Mark, Tolliver, Mariella and Gracie Lang, and stepfather to Harper and Cameron Connelly. He was married to Harper's mother, Laurel Howe Connelly Lang. * Xylda Bernardo: A psychic who appears in books 2‚Äì3 as a friend and colleague of Harper and Tolliver. She is the grandmother of Manfred Bernardo. Although she possesses genuine psychic ability, she is described as an \\"old fraud\\" due to sometimes unscrupulous, although never malicious, conduct. Television adaptation CBS was developing a series based on the Harper Connelly Mysteries series with Ridley Scott and Tony Scott as executive producers. Could Charlaine Harris' Harper Connelly Book Series Become the Next 'True Blood'? Charlaine Harris later stated that CBS had passed on the show and it would not be adapted. In April 2012, Charlaine confirmed that SyFy was making a television adaption of the Harper Connelly Mysteries series.

(January 21, 1836 - February 1, 1916) was the Superior General of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana from 1874-83. During her term, she established missions beyond Indiana for the first time and greatly reduced the Congregation's indebtedness, which was partly a result of the Panic of 1873. She was born Margaret Glenn in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, in 1836 but grew up in Indiana. Her parochial school in Madison was run by the Sisters of Providence, and the congregation foundress Saint Mother Theodore Guerin visited this mission in 1846. Mother Theodore was impressed by Margaret and gave her a picture representing a child near the Blessed Virgin. Margaret later remarked that this was the beginning of her vocation to become a religious sister. Margaret later entered the Sisters of Providence and took the name Sister Mary Ephrem. By 1862 she was a fully professed Sister and was sent to work at a school in Loogootee, Indiana. In 1866, due to her way with finances, Sister Mary Ephrem was named the Econome (Treasurer) of the congregation, in charge of all accounting. She also spent time at St. Rose Academy in Vincennes, Indiana. As Superior General In 1874, with the congregation struggling with debt and other issues arising from the Panic of 1873, Sister Mary Ephrem was elected Superior General of the Sisters of Providence. From then on she was honored with the title Mother Mary Ephrem. She was a strong advocate of parochial education. In addition to schools already run by the Sisters of Providence, Mother Mary Ephrem oversaw the opening of seventeen parish schools, though several did not succeed due to lack of financial support by poor congregations. Schools in Michigan, Ohio and Illinois took the Sisters of Providence outside of Indiana for the first time, with the permission of Bishop Jacques-Maurice De Saint Palais. While visiting one of these missions in 1881, Mother Mary Ephrem met and inspired another young student who would grow up to be a Superior General of the congregation, Mother Mary Raphael Slattery. Mother Mary Ephrem also proved skillful at soliciting donors and regulating spending within the congregation, greatly reducing the debt of the Sisters of Providence. A special project undertaken during her term was the building of the St. Anne Shell Chapel, a small stone chapel to replace a wooden one built by Mother Theodore to honor Saint Anne after a harrowing trip. The chapel was completed in 1876. Mother Mary Ephrem also began the building of a new novitiate. After her nine-year term, Mother Mary Ephrem returned to her post as Econome for the congregation in 1883. In 1890, she went to St. Patrick's in Terre Haute, Indiana, which she had founded in 1881.St. Patrick's School History In 1891 she went to teach in Galesburg, Illinois. After various other ministries, Mother Mary Ephrem spent the last ten years of her life at the motherhouse, where she died on February 1, 1916.

Wards in dark grey were not contested in 2004. The 2004 St Albans City and District Council election took place on 10 June 2004 to elect members of St Albans District Council in Hertfordshire, England. One third of the council was up for election and the council stayed under no overall control. After the election, the composition of the council was *Liberal Democrats 29 *Conservative 17 *Labour 11 *Independent 1 Background After the last election in 2003 the Liberal Democrats were the largest party on the council with 23 seats, compared to 21 for the Conservatives, 13 for Labour and there was 1 independent. In April 2004 the Liberal Democrats gained a seat from the Conservatives at a by-election in Verulam, which meant they needed to gain 6 seats at the 2004 council election to take a majority on the council. St Albans was reported by national newspapers to be a council that the Liberal Democrats were hoping to win a majority on. 18 seats were contested at the election with only Colney Heath and Sandridge wards not having elections. Candidates from the 3 main parties stood in all 18 wards apart from in Redbourn, where the Liberal Democrats did not put up a candidate to oppose the independent councillor, Tony Swendell, who was standing for re-election. Two other parties put up some candidates, 3 from the new St Albans Party and 2 from the Green Party. 4 Conservative councillors stood down at the election, Mike Bretherton, Mike Jameson, Martin Treasure and Hazel Ward, as well as 1 from Labour, Andrew Rose and 1 Liberal Democrat, John White. Election result The results saw the Liberal Democrat make 5 gains but come up one seat short of gaining an overall majority. They gained seats in Ashley and St Peters wards from Labour, and in Marshalswick South, Park Street and Wheathampstead from the Conservatives, to have exactly half of the 58 seats on the council. This reduced the Conservatives to 17 seats and Labour to 11 seats, while independent Anthony Swendell was re- elected in Redbourn. Following the election the Liberal Democrats took control of the council with all of the seats on the council cabinet after winning a vote 29 to 24, with 1 abstention, despite opposition from both Labour and the Conservatives.

(September 15, 1847 ‚Äì August 27, 1889) was the Superior General of the Sisters of Providence of Saint Mary-of-the-Woods, Indiana, from 1883 to 1889. She was a convert from Methodism. During her term, she established missions of the Sisters of Providence in Chicago, Illinois and Chelsea, Massachusetts. She began building the Church of the Immaculate Conception on the motherhouse grounds in 1886. She died in office August 27, 1889. Early life She was born Anna Hinkle in 1847, in Carrollton, Kentucky to George D. Hinkle and Lucy S. Hawkins. Her father was a prominent judge connected with the publishing firm of Wilson, Hinkle and Co. Her mother died when Anna was very young, and she was raised by her father and a paternal aunt. Although the Hinkles were Methodist, George sent his daughters to St. Augustine School, run by the Sisters of Providence. Anna was unhappy with this arrangement and made her displeasure known in school, one day even going so far as to toss all of the classroom books on Christian Doctrine out the window. However, as her schooling continued, Anna was drawn to Catholicism and soon converted. She entered the Sisters of Providence on July 14, 1864, taking the name Sister Euphrasie, and spent a year at St. John Academy in Indianapolis. After taking her first vows, she became Assistant Mistress of Novices, a position that she held until 1874. She then was appointed Superior of St. Rose Academy in Vincennes, Indiana. In August 1880, Sister Euphrasie was elected into the general administration of the Sisters of Providence as Second Assistant to Mother Mary Ephrem Glenn. With her background in education, Sister Euphrasie was very helpful in school mission visitations, a yearly required task for Superiors General. As Superior General In 1883, Sister Euphrasie was herself elected Superior General of the Sisters of Providence and was called Mother Euphrasie from then on. A priority of her administration was education, not only in schools run by the Sisters but also of the Sisters themselves. During her term she opened numerous schools, including the first Chicago mission of the congregation (St. Philip, now St. Mel) and the first East Coast mission (St. Rose in Chelsea, Massachusetts). She also began building the Church of the Immaculate Conception in her term, working with architects D.A. Bohlen & Son of Indianapolis. The cornerstone was laid on September 14, 1886. (The church was not completed until 1907.) In the elections of 1886, Mother Euphrasie asked to be relieved of her position due to failing health, but she was re-elected. In addition to her personal problems, the motherhouse burned down on February 7, 1889. She died on August 27, 1889, aged 41.

When Musette learns that Lothario is married and has a baby, Mignon, she jumps off a cliff. For revenge, Giarno kidnaps Mignon. After Lothario's wife dies of grief, Lothario becomes a mad, wandering minstrel. When Mignon is sixteen, the young nobleman Wilhelm Meister, seeing her mistreatment, buys Mignon from Giarno. Mignon falls in love with Wilhelm, but she believes that he loves the actress Filina. At a fete, Filina locks Mignon, whom Lothario has befriended, into her room. Filina traps Wilhelm into proposing, but as he announces their engagement, Lothario, acting on Mignon's earlier suggestions, sets the castle on fire. Wilhelm rescues Mignon, but because she still believes that he loves Filina, she leaves with Lothario. When an innkeeper recognizes Lothario and shows him a piece of the baby Mignon's belt, Lothario's memory returns. As Mignon has the other piece, she is revealed to be his daughter. Wilhelm finds them, and he and Mignon vow to marry.

There are two types of incorporated municipalities in Maine, towns and cities. The tables below differentiate between towns and cities. Most areas of New England are entirely divided into incorporated municipalities, with no unincorporated territory. In the three northern New England states, however, some unincorporated territory does exist, generally in areas that are very sparsely populated. Maine contains significantly more unincorporated territory than the other states, with the bulk of it in interior and northern counties, including Washington County. Some unincorporated territory in Maine is organized into a third type of town- level municipality unique to Maine, called a plantation (considered to be ‚Äúorganized‚Äù, but not incorporated), while some is entirely unorganized. Washington County also contains two Indian reservations, which are considered to be distinct entities independent from any municipality, although this has not always been the case in the past. Due to the large extent of unincorporated territory in Washington County, separate sections with detailed historical census totals for such areas follow the main tables below. For any census, adding up the totals for each town-level municipality, including any plantations, unorganized entities and Indian reservations (when recognized as independent entities), should yield the county total.

This consisted of 442 residents in organized plantations, and 1,315 residents in unorganized territory. An additional 1,316 residents lived on Indian reservations. Plantations As of 1900, Washington County contained six plantations: Codyville, Kossuth, Grand Lake Stream, Lambert Lake, Plantation No. 14, and Plantation No.21 (the last two were in an area originally laid out as sequentially numbered townships, and had simply kept their numbers when they organized as plantations). Kossuth had been incorporated as a town for a time in the 19th century, but had disincorporated and changed to a plantation form of government prior to 1900. Of the six plantations in existence in 1900, only two remain today, Codyville and Grand Lake Stream. Kossuth and Lambert Lake apparently dissolved during the 1920s, while No. 21 did so in 1983 and No. 14 in 1986. On the other hand, an additional plantation has been added: the former town of Baring, which organized as a plantation in 1961 (Baring had disincorporated as a town in early 1940s). Topsfield also operated as a plantation for a brief period following its disincorporation as a town in 1940; it was reported as a plantation in the 1940 Census, but surrendered its organization as a plantation the following year (1941). Some sources also suggest that Edmunds and Brookton may have briefly operated as plantations following their disincorporations as towns; if they did, their existence as plantations must have been very brief, and did not last long enough for them to be reported as such in a decennial census. 1900 *Grand Lake Stream 221 *Lambert Lake 113 *No. 21 86 *No. 14 77 *Codyville 68 *Kossuth 46 1910 *Grand Lake Stream 290 *Lambert Lake 104 *No. 14 82 *No. 21 81 *Codyville 69 *Kossuth 44 1920 *Grand Lake Stream 231 *Lambert Lake 119 *Codyville 80 *No. 21 79 *No. 14 74 *Kossuth 40 1930 *Grand Lake Stream 240 *Codyville 89 *No. 21 88 *No. 14 73 1940 *Topsfield 221 *Grand Lake Stream 216 *No. 21 110 *No. 14 99 *Codyville 79 1950 *Grand Lake Stream 294 *No. 21 84 *No. 14 80 *Codyville 62 1960 *Grand Lake Stream 219 *No. 14 63 *No. 21 56 *Codyville 38 1970 *Grand Lake Stream 186 *Baring 181 *No. 21 83 *Codyville 45 *No. 14 29 1980 *Baring 308 *Grand Lake Stream 198 *No. 21 127 *No. 14 52 *Codyville 43 1990 *Baring 275 *Grand Lake Stream 174 *Codyville 35 2000 *Baring 273 *Grand Lake Stream 150 *Codyville 19 Unorganized Territory Like all of Maine's interior and northern counties, Washington County contains a significant amount of unorganized territory. Most of the unorganized territory in Washington County is in areas which have historically been very sparsely populated. The southern and southeastern parts of the county, along the coast, were historically fully incorporated. Further inland, lower-lying areas with access to lakes and rivers have generally been incorporated or organized, while more mountainous or remote areas have often never had any significant population and have remained unorganized. The area along the western edge of the county, bordering Hancock County, is largely unorganized, down to a point just a few towns away from the coast. Historically, about two-thirds of the county's land area was incorporated or organized, leaving the remaining one-third unorganized. There are approximately 25 townships in the county which have never been organized, along with a few others which never advanced beyond the plantation stage. Washington County saw one town disincorporation as early as 1895 (Kossuth), followed by another in 1924 (Forest City). Between 1935 and 1945, a large number of municipalities in Maine dissolved and reverted to unorganized townships. In Washington County, this included six communities which had historically been towns (Edmunds, Marion, Topsfield, Baring, Brookton and Trescott). Since that time, Piscataquis County has both gained and lost municipalities. In the 1960s, Topsfield re-incorporated as a town, and the former town of Baring organized as a plantation. In the 1980s, two plantations dissolved (No. 14 and No. 21), and in 2004 the town of Centerville disincorporated. The areas of Hancock County that are entirely unorganized cover about , with a population of about 1,300. This covers about 40% of the county's land area, but includes less than 4% of its population. Six unorganized townships have large enough populations to maintain a registrar and clerk to conduct elections for state and federal offices, although they do not have true organized municipal governments: Brookton, Centerville, Edmunds, No. 14, No.21 and No. 27. All except No. 27 were incorporated towns or organized plantations at one time. Over the years, the U.S. Census Bureau has used different methods to compile data for unorganized territory in Maine. From 1900 to 1950, data was tabulated for each individual unorganized entity. In 1960, a single catch-all ‚ÄúUnorganized Territory‚Äù listing was provided for each Maine county, generally with no further breakdown. Since 1970, the Census has grouped contiguous areas in each county into one or more ‚Äúunorganized territories‚Äù. As of the 2000 Census, two such areas are recognized within Hancock County: *North Washington Unorganized Territory: the bulk of the historically unorganized territory in the county, covering much of the northern and western parts of the county. The Territory is irregularly shaped and encompasses approximately 29 unorganized townships. This includes the former towns of Brookton, Forest City and Kossuth, as well as the former Lambert Lake Plantation and Plantation No. 21. The former town of Centerville was also added when it disincorporated in 2004. *East Central Washington Unorganized Territory: a group of six unorganized townships in the east central part of the county: the former towns of Trescott, Edmunds and Marion; the former Plantation No. 14 (also known as T14 ED); T18 ED; and T19 ED. The Territory is irregularly shaped, and completely surrounded by organized municipalities except for an ocean boundary in the former town of Trescott. The roster of Unorganized Territories in Washington County has not changed since Unorganized Territories were first created for the 1970 Census. The listings below provide population figures for 1) all unincorporated territory, including plantations; 2) organized plantations, for which breakouts are available in the main tables above; and 3) unorganized territory, with any available breakouts provided. 1900 All unincorporated territory 841 Organized plantations 611 Unorganized territory 230 *Indian Twp. 87 *Forest Twp.

This numbering scheme also covered a significant portion of Hancock County, and extended into southern Penobscot County as well. Many of the remaining unorganized townships in Washington County are in the MD or ED sequences. The MD townships, which can be found in the southwestern part of the county, are numbered row-by-row south to north, then west to east within each row. For example, T18 MD is to the north of the town of Columbia; T30 MD is further north; and T42 MD even further directly north. The ED townships, further to the east, are numbered column-by-column east to west, then south to north within each column. The former plantations No. 14 and No. 21 were in the ED sequence. There are also two ND townships in Hancock County, to the north of the MD area (T5 ND and T6 ND). Most of the unorganized townships in these sequences are identified only by their survey numbers and have never developed informal township names. *To the northeast of the territory that was originally surveyed as part of Bingham's Penobscot Purchase, a handful of townships were originally surveyed as part of Titcomb's Survey (TS). A few of these remain unorganized, including T1R1 (also known as Fowler Twp.), T1R2 (also known as Dyer Twp.), and T1R3 (also known as Lambert Lake Twp.). *The area to the northwest of the territory that was originally surveyed as part of Bingham's Penobscot Purchase, as well as the last few rows of townships at the northern edge of the county, were originally part of the NBPP (North of Bingham's Penobscot Purchase) grid. This grid also extends into Penobscot County. The numbering of these townships is somewhat irregular, but all of the unorganized townships on this grid in Washington County are in rows 6 through 11 (numbered west to east) and in rows 1 through 4 (numbered south to north). Indian Reservations Maine contains three federally recognized Indian reservations. Two of these are in Washington County, both under the jurisdiction of the Passamaquoddy tribe. These are the Passamaquoddy Indian Township Reservation and the Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point Reservation. Maine currently treats Indian reservations as distinct entities, not part of any organized municipality or unorganized entity. This has not always been the case in the past; at one time, present-day reservation land was regarded as part of the municipalities or unorganized entities within which it is geographically located. The Pleasant Point Reservation, the smaller of the two reservations, is an enclave in the town of Perry, with a short border with the city of Eastport. It covers less than half of a square mile. The larger Indian Township Reservation occupies an entire survey township, bordered by Grand Lake Stream Plantation and the towns of Waite and Princeton, along Grand Falls Lake. It has a land area of about . Treatment of the reservations by the State of Maine, and by the Census Bureau, has varied over time. The Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point Reservation was first recognized in the 1940 Census, where it was referred to simply as the ‚ÄúPassamaquoddy Indian Reservation‚Äù. The Census began referring to it by its present name in 1970. Prior to 1940, the population of the present-day reservation appears to have been included with the town of Perry. Passamaquoddy Indian Township Reservation was first recognized by the Census under that name in 1970. Because it covers an area originally considered to be an entire survey township, however, its population can be tracked for all censuses from 1900 to 1950, though it was being treated as an unorganized township at the time, not as an Indian reservation (it was usually referred to in Census listings as ‚ÄúIndian Township‚Äù or ‚ÄúIndiantown Township‚Äù). See the ‚ÄúUnorganized Territory‚Äù section for population totals. In 1960, a separate breakout for Indian Township was not provided, as the Census had discontinued the practice of publishing totals for each individual unorganized township. The population of the reservations has been recorded as follows: 1940 *Passamaquoddy Indian Reservation 328 1950 *Passamaquoddy Indian Reservation 354 1960 *Passamaquoddy Indian Reservation 330 1970 Total: 600 *Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point Reservation 307 *Passamaquoddy Indian Township Reservation 293 1980 Total: 972 *Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point Reservation 549 *Passamaquoddy Indian Township Reservation 423 1990 Total: 1,189 *Passamaquoddy Indian Township Reservation 617 *Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point Reservation 572 2000 Total: 1,315 *Passamaquoddy Indian Township Reservation 676 *Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point Reservation 640 Notes 1970 Census The Census Bureau made a number of revisions to 1970 census totals subsequent to their initial release: *The original 1970 Census reports did not provide breakouts for either of the Indian reservations in Washington County. The Passamaquoddy Pleasant Point Reservation was included in the total for the town of Perry (which was originally reported as 878), while Passamaquoddy Indian Township Reservation was included in the total for North Washington Unorganized Territory (which was originally reported as 793). The totals were later revised to break out the two Indian reservations, and the totals for Perry and North Washington Unorganized Territory were revised to those shown in the lists above. *The original 1970 Census Reports reported Baring as ‚ÄúBaring Unorganized Territory‚Äù. This appears to have been in error, as sources indicate that Baring had organized as a plantation in 1961. (Baring had previously disincorporated as a town; had Baring in fact been an unorganized township as of 1970, it would have been logical for it to be treated as its own unincorporated territory, as it did not border any other land within Washington County that is unorganized.) The 1980 Census reports note that Baring had been reported as an Unorganized Territory in 1970 but provide no further explanation. *The original 1970 Census reports did not contain a breakout for the Town of Topsfield, apparently treating it as part of North Washington Unorganized Territory. This appears to have been in error, as sources indicate that Topsfield had re-incorporated as a town in 1960. Later Census reports were revised to include a 1970 population total for Topsfield (177). Oddly, however, the total for North Washington Unorganized Territory was not adjusted to reflect this change. As a result, in the list above, adding together the totals for each municipality, Unorganized Territory and Indian reservation does not yield the county total, but comes out to 177 more (30,036). It would appear that the county total shown above (29,859) is in fact correct, and that the total for North Washington Unorganized Territory should actually be 177 less than what is shown above (323 instead of 500). The 1980 Census reports note that Topsfield had ‚Äúreorganized‚Äù but provide no further explanation. 1990 Census The 1990 Census reports show Baring as a town. This appears to have been in error, as both the 1980 and 2000 Census reports show Baring as a plantation, the 1990 Census reports make no other reference to this change, and the author of this article has found no other evidence suggesting that Baring was a town around the time of the 1990 Census. Until information to the contrary is discovered, this article assumes that Baring should have been shown as a plantation in 1990.

History Boeing 707 LV-MSG at Malpensa Airport, Italy, 1981 The airline was set up in December 1969 by Carlos F. Martinez Guerrero and several of his associates. Operations commenced in July 1970, however, the first aircraft, a Canadair CL-44 freighter did not commence service with the airline until 1971. Flights with the CL-44 commenced between Buenos Aires and Houston, on which cattle were transported, and the airline quickly established itself operating worldwide ad hoc charters, leading to the addition of three more of the aircraft type. The airline had regular flights to Houston, Miami, and Basel, Switzerland from September 1976. The airline acquired its first Boeing 707 freighter from Dan-Air in 1978, and a second one a year later. The arrival of the 707s led to the gradual retirement from service of the CL-44s. Transporte A√©reo Rioplatense continued to operate into the 1980s, but had ceased operations by 1989. 1981 CL-44 crash Canadair CL-44 of TAR at Basle Airport in October 1976. The same aircraft was brought down by the Soviet Air Force in July 1981 In 1981 the airline was contracted to conduct a series of flights to send arms to Iran, to assist in arming Nicaraguan contras. Military equipment from Israel was shipped to Iran, in support of the latter during its war with Iraq. A total of 360 tons of arms was to be transported from Israel to Iran. On 18 July 1981, one of the airline's CL-44s was returning to Cyprus after making the third delivery flight to Iran. It strayed into Soviet airspace in the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic and the Soviet Air Force sent a Sukhoi Su-15 to intercept it. The Su-15 hit the CL-44's tail and it crashed near the Soviet‚ÄìTurkish border, killing all four of the occupants. The Soviet Union claimed that its Su-15 pilot deliberately downed the CL-44 by aerial ramming.

Ilva Ligabue studied at the Milan Conservatory in the class of Campogalliani and at La Scuola di Canto alla Scala where she made her debut as Marina in 1953.Blyth, Alan. Obituary for Ilva Ligabue.

After singing with success at most of the Italian opera houses, she won considerable acclaim in the title role of Beatrice di Tenda at La Scala in 1961, followed by Margherita in Boito's Mefistofele in Chicago. She then began appearing abroad, notably in Germany, also singing at the Vienna State Opera, the Paris Opera, and became a regular guest artist at the Glyndebourne Festival and the Aix-en- Provence Festival, where she was especially admired as Fiordiligi in Cosi fan tutte. She also appeared in Buenos Aires, Chicago and New York City.

A notable feature of his lordship is the North Gate of Athenry, which is believed to have been built in his time.

Life She was the sister of Marshal Pyotr Rumyantsev and married to Count James Bruce, governor of Saint Petersburg. She became the lady-in-waiting of Catherine soon after Catherine's arrival in Russia in 1744, and continued to be so after Catherine's elevation to the throne in 1762. She was described as an attractive woman, the \\"Right hand\\" of Catherine. Catherine called her \\"Brussja\\" and entrusted her with her most intimate personal affairs. Catherine said of her that she was \\"the person to whom I can say everything, without fear of the consequences\\", and she is described as her closest confidant in her private affairs. Bruce is best known in history as \\"l'√©prouveuse\\", for the role she allegedly played in Catherine's love life. According to legend, Bruce was to \\"test\\" any prospective lovers sexually before they became the lovers of Catherine, after they had been suggested by Potemkin, chosen by Catherine, and examined by a doctor. This very same role has then been attributed to her successor as lady-in-waiting, Anna Protasova. This is unconfirmed, and it is unknown how much truth there is in this, but it is a well-reported story in history. Bruce played an important role in developing the relationship between Catherine and Potemkin, notably as a messenger, a role she played until the relationship was consummated in 1773, when it was she who was given the task to persuade Potemkin to leave his exile in a convent and enter into a relationship with Catherine. She is suggested to have been Potemkin's advisor from the beginning in the 1760s. In 1779, Catherine was directed into a room where she witnessed her latest lover, Ivan Rimsky-Korsakov, having sex with Bruce. The person who directed her is believed to have been Aleksandra von Engelhardt, on the order of Potemkin, who wished for the removal of both Korsakov and Bruce from court. This resulted in the fall of both Korsakov and Bruce: Korsakov was sent in exile to Moscow. Bruce soon followed him, but the relationship of Bruce and Korsakov ended shortly after and Bruce returned to reside with her spouse. She was dismissed as a lady-in-waiting and replaced by Anna Stepanova Protasova (1745‚Äì1826), the cousin of Alexej Orlov, who is mentioned as \\"l'√©prouveuse\\" in the poems of Byron. In Popular Culture Bruce is played by Gina McKee in the 2019 TV miniseries Catherine the Great.

This approach differs from the classical method according to which all government spending is done from a consolidated fund. History Hypothecated taxes have a long history. One of the first examples of earmarking was ship money, the tax paid by English seaports used to finance the Royal Navy. Later, in the 20th century, the hypothecated tax began to be discussed by politicians in the United Kingdom. For example, the Vehicle Excise Duty from 1920 when earned revenues were used for the construction and maintenance of the roads, assigning 1p on the income tax directly to education in 1992, or giving ¬£300 million per year from the revenues from taxes on the tobacco industry to help the fight against smoking-related diseases since 1999. Nowadays, earmarking of taxes is mainly connected to the health care system, education or the upkeep of the roads. Types of hypothecated tax The hypothecated tax can be divided into three groups based on the main characteristics. The emphasis can be put on the final use of the revenues, on the vastness of the area financed from the money earned or on the type of the tax. Each group then has two subsections. In the first case, we distinguish between strong and weak hypothecation. Strong hypothecation means that the revenues from the tax go only to financing the particular service and the service is financed only through the revenues from this tax. Strong hypothecation is thought to be appropriate for pure public goods where voters must reveal their consumption preferences. If at least one of the two conditions is not met, we say that the hypothecation is weak. This distinction is the most common as many of the arguments for and against hypothecated tax are based on it. Secondly, differentiation is made between wide and narrow hypothecation. When the tax revenues finance the entire public service such as the health care, it is described as wide hypothecation. Narrow hypothecation means that only a specific area such as nursery education is funded. The third level of splitting is based on the type of, and the reason for imposing, the tax that is hypothecated. The most supported type is a combination of strong and narrow hypothecation. In this case, the hypothecation can serve as a beneficial link between demand and supply. An example can be financing the roads in the U.S. by the gasoline tax. Benefits There are three main ideas of which benefits hypothecation can bring: believing that people will be willing to pay more for better services; demonstrating the real cost of services to people; and supporting democracy. These can be broken down into four main hypothecation-supporting points. * Transparency ‚Äì Hypothecated taxation makes the link between revenues from taxes and government spending more visible and consumers may be better able to decide how much they are willing to pay. * Accountability and trust ‚Äì Hypothecated taxes may help when the government is not trusted. With hypothecation, it will have to follow a plan made in advance and will have no flexibility. * Public support ‚Äì The knowledge that the money paid on taxes will go directly to some needed service (e.g. health care) can help to reduce the dissatisfaction of the population with an increase in taxes. * Protecting resources ‚Äì Earmarking can protect resources for financing services (such as health care) from being spent in other areas. Criticism The arguments against earmarking come mostly from the traditional way of viewing the taxes where they were confined to compulsory, unrequited payments to the general government as defined by the OECD in 1988. Firstly, public spending should be determined by policies and not by the amount of the revenue raised. With earmarking, inappropriate funding levels may occur as the strong hypothecated tax implies the dependence of spending on the tax revenues and thus on the macroeconomic performance of the country. Secondly, the flexibility of fiscal policy and thus the ability to influence the economic situation is reduced when hypothecation is used. In 2012, the Mercatus Center pointed outThe Effects of Dedicating Tax Revenues the negative effects that dedicating tax revenues to specific expenditures can have on the policymakers. In their report they stated that hypothecation can be used to mask the increases in total government spending. Examples The problem of ambiguity of hypothecation occurs in many countries all over the world. As mentioned before, revenues of hypothecated taxes are often used to finance health care or education because in these sectors the aggregate preference can be easily revealed. One of the most known cases of hypothecation in Europe is the National Insurance contribution in the United Kingdom. Money that is raised goes directly to the National Insurance Fund from which the benefits are paid. This is also an example of the combination of wide and weak earmarking. (In practice, National Insurance today funds general government expenditures, for after accounting for health spending there is a large surplus which is loaned to the Consolidated Fund.) The health care system is also often supported by taxes on tobacco, as smoking is considered a serious threat. For example, in Egypt, the revenue earned from these taxes is used to help to cover health insurance and provide prevention and rehabilitation for students. Besides the United Kingdom and Egypt, hypothecation helps to finance health care in many countries including Finland, the Republic of Korea, Portugal, Thailand and Belgium. (Hypothecation of tax revenue for health Ole Doetinchem, World Health Report (2010) Background Paper, 51) An example from a different sector is television licences. People who use television sets to receive broadcast transmissions can be obliged to pay an annual fee (depending on local laws) and the revenues can be used to fund public broadcasting. In the UK the money raised goes to the BBC, but this type of hypothecation is also applied in many European countries.

Biography One of nine children, John Paschang was born in Hemingford, Nebraska, to Casper and Gertrude (n√©e Fisher) Paschang. Drawn to the religious life from high school, he studied at Conception Seminary College in Conception, Missouri, and at St. John's Seminary in Collegeville, Minnesota. He was ordained to the priesthood on June 12, 1921. After serving as pastor of St. Rose of Lima Church in Hooper (1921-1923), he furthered his studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., from where he earned a doctorate in canon law. He then served as pastor of Holy Cross Church in Omaha from 1927 to 1951. On July 28, 1951, Paschang was appointed the fourth Bishop of Grand Island by Pope Pius XII. He received his episcopal consecration on the following October 9 from Archbishop Gerald Thomas Bergan, with Bishops Louis Benedict Kucera and Edward Joseph Hunkeler serving as co-consecrators. During his tenure, he ordained 55 priests and established 33 churches, 15 parish houses, 13 schools, 11 parish centers, six convents, several rectories, and four hospital additions. He attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965), but was privately opposed to some of the Council's more liberal reforms. He also earned a stockbroker's license to better his knowledge of financial investments for the church. After twenty-one years as bishop, Paschang retired on July 25, 1972. He founded the Damian Leper Relief Society in 1976. He moved to St. Joseph's Retirement Home in West Point in 1993, and said Mass every day in his room until he was hospitalized at St. Francis Memorial Hospital in 1999. At the time of his death, at age 103, he was the world's oldest living Catholic bishop.

Vermilion border is noticeably more defined in post-operative aspect. A lip lift is a plastic surgery procedure that modifies the cosmetic appearance of the lips by reshaping them to increase the prominence of the vermilion border; and to enhance the facial area above the lips into a more aesthetically pleasing shape. In corrective praxis, a lip lift procedure is distinguished from lip enhancement, the augmentation of the lips, which can be effected with a non-surgical procedure. Background Techniques There are surgical and non-surgical techniques for effecting lip lift and lip augmentation to the lips. The surgical techniques include incisions below the nose and in the periphery of the lips area of the face, the perioral area; other techniques effect the surgical incisions from inside the mouth. Surgical aesthetics The aesthetic ideal of a mouth with youthful lips‚Äîshaped like a lozenge‚Äîfeatures an upper lip with a pronounced Cupid's bow, and much fullness to each lip; however, such an ideal physiognomy declines with age, and the lips shrink and lose anatomic definition, as the lips sag, which affects the aesthetics of the smile, by revealing less of the teeth during a relaxed smile.Austin HW, 1986. The American Society of Plastic Surgeons reported 3.2 million cosmetic surgery procedures performed to mature patients, aged 55 years and older, in 2008. The patient demand for facial rejuvenation indicates that most requests do not include the mouth, which results in a surgical outcome that is aesthetically deficient.Fanous N, 1984.Aiache AE, 1997.Wilkinson TS, 1994(a).Rohrich RJ, et al., 2000.Weston GW, et al., 2009. In the 1980s, when collagen, originally the principal filler for the lips, proved limited in effecting permanent correction, plastic surgeons then developed surgical techniques for lifting and augmenting the lips, and correcting aesthetic defects and deformities.Jacono AA, Quatela V C, 2004. Surgical procedures A systematic review regarding \\"non-filling\\" procedures for lip augmentation classified lip lift techniques in four surgical categories: the direct lip lift (DLL), indirect lip lift (ILL), corner of the mouth lift (CML), and the V‚ÄìY lip advancement (VYLA).San Miguel Moragas J, 2014. Lip lift: the pre-operative aspect (left), and the post-operative aspect of the lifte corners of the mouth.  Direct lip lift (DLL)  The \\"gull-wing lift\\" is an effective surgical technique for increasing the prominence (display) of the vermilion coloring of the lips, by removing skin (and other tissues) as required, ether directly from or from above the white line of skin that borders onto, and sets off, the vermilion of the lips (the white roll). The incisions remove tissue and significantly alter the shape of the lips by moving up the vermilion from both peaks of the Cupid's bow outwards to the commissures, the corners of the mouth. Incisions are also made below the lower lip to increase the projection of the vermilion of the lower lip. This gull-wing lip lift usually requires an OR time of approximately 20 minutes; post-operatively, the swelling of the lips subsides at 1‚Äì2 weeks and the tightness subsides at 2‚Äì4 months. Asymmetry, under-correction, and hypertrophic scarring are possible complications.  Indirect lip lift (ILL)  = Subnasal bullhorn ILL= A technical variant of the gull-wing lip lift is the sub-nasal lip lift (bull- horn lip lift), which involves the removal of either an ellipse or a curved- edge ellipse of tissue from under the nose. The skin then is raised, and sutured to lift the lip and expose more of the upper-lip vermilion.Greenwald AE. 1987. Depending upon the indications of the patient, this technique can increase the drooping the corners of the mouth (commissures); thus, the sub- nasal lip lift often includes a corner-lift surgical step. In the corner lift procedure (external angle oral commissuroplasty), triangles of tissue are resected from above the commissures, thereby elevating the corners of the mouth. A descending wedge of tissue can also be removed to add contour to the Cupid's bow or to reduce bulky lips. = Thread lip lift = Another variation is the thread lift, in which a square stitch is placed from one nostril to the other and down to the peaks of the Cupid's bow. This variation has fallen out of favor because the results are short-lived. = Double duck lip lift = Another variation is the Double duck lip lift, in which the columella of the nose is not incised.  Corner of the mouth lift (CML)  Another variation of the procedure consists of a lenticular excision of the white skin surrounding the upper oral commissure in order to lift this part of the lips. This technique has also been dubbed \\"Smile Lift\\".  V-Y lip augmentation  Another variation of the procedure is for a surgeon to make an incision inside the mouth to loosen the mucosa and vermilion, which are then advanced and secured, leaving a portion of scar tissue inside the mouth which may take 2-4 months to heal. Yet another technique uses a \\"W\\" incision inside the mouth to create several \\"V\\" flaps, which are then used in a V-to-Y plasty technique to advance the vermilion of either or both lips. This procedure leaves no exposed areas inside the mouth, but can be painful and has a lengthy recovery period. Outcomes Although surgeons report patient satisfaction with these techniques to be \\"high,\\" no one variation has been sufficiently applauded to become the standard procedure. Most of these methods result in an increase in the amount of vermilion visible. Quantitative data exists for the V-Y lip augmentation, for which statistically significant increases in upper vermilion height and surface area have been measured. A systematic review regarding \\"non-filling\\" procedures for lip augmentation published in 2014 showed that philtrum length decreases with Indirect Lip Lift techniques, but not with V-Y lip augmentation. Complications which may arise from lip lift surgery include: * Numbness * Stiffness * Pain * Parasthesia * Lip distortion * Lip lengthening * Smile deformation * Speech impediment * Visible scarring Bc of this, patients must be on bed rest for at least a week. In particular, the technique of removing skin at or directly above the white roll has been singled out as resulting in unfavorable scarring and stiffness in the lips.Wilkinson, T. S., 2013. Advancements and improvements in non- surgical fillers available for lip enhancement has reduced demand for the lip lift procedure.

This network of women invests in the lives of low-income women ‚Äì and single moms in particular ‚Äì so they, in turn, can enrich the lives of their children. The Women‚Äôs Foundation‚Äôs mission is to foster a powerful wave of philanthropy to improve the lives of women and girls in the surrounding region. The Women‚Äôs Foundation accomplishes this by: expanding and leveraging women‚Äôs philanthropy; increasing social change philanthropy in the community; providing grants, operational resources and technical assistance to local organizations; and serving as a regional voice for women and girls. Washington Area Women‚Äôs Foundation serves Washington, DC, Montgomery County and Prince George's County in Maryland, and Alexandria, Fairfax County and Arlington County in Virginia. The Women‚Äôs Foundation is the only public foundation in the metropolitan DC area that is dedicated to improving the lives of women and girls. It is one of the fastest growing women‚Äôs funds in the country, both in terms of supporting donors and the number of grants made.  History  The organization was first conceived by a small group of women who got together for a Sunday afternoon tea on May 18, 1997 in Bethesda, MD. In 1998, Washington Area Women‚Äôs Foundation was officially established. It was founded on the principle that women, working together, can enhance the physical, social, and financial well-being of women and girls in the Washington metropolitan area by providing financial resources to local nonprofits already engaged in innovative, effective work for communities in need. In its first year, The Women‚Äôs Foundation increased its individual donors from 75 to over 300 with creative fundraising strategies, including over $5,000 from Beanie Baby sales at Sandy Rubin‚Äôs store, garnering her The Women‚Äôs Foundation‚Äôs first Entrepreneurial Philanthropy award. Since 2006, The Women‚Äôs Foundation has granted over $1 million per year to area nonprofits.  Philanthropy  The Women‚Äôs Foundation encourages philanthropic investments in the community in a number of ways intended to encourage members to donate at whatever level is best for them. Individuals Some participants choose to be individual donors, making one-time, occasional, or regular donations both large and small. Giving Circles There are two giving circles that allow women to come together and contribute as a group. The Rainmakers Giving Circle, founded in 2003, supports programs for young women and girls between the ages of 10 and 21 that empower and increase competence in the areas of employment, education, health and life skills. Rainmakers Giving Circle members commit to give $5,000 each over two years. To date, they've invested more than $200,000 in nonprofits supporting young women and girls in the DC metropolitan area. Since 2004, the African American Women‚Äôs Giving Circle has invested nearly $120,000 in nonprofits supporting African American women and girls. The circle includes 15-25 women who have each made a financial commitment of at least $2,000 over a two-year period and agreed to work together to determine which local nonprofits will receive grants. Leadership Networks The Women‚Äôs Foundation has also created two Leadership Networks. The Washington 100 combines the resources of more than 100 women and men who make a two-year commitment of $10,000 each. The result is more than $1 million of critical support to fuel programs that build strong communities through investments in women and girls. The 1K Club is a network of emerging philanthropists committed to strengthening the effectiveness of The Women‚Äôs Foundation and its work. 1K Club members each contribute a minimum of $1,000 paid over a two-year period‚Äîor approximately $42 per month. Leadership Luncheon The Leadership Luncheon is The Women‚Äôs Foundation‚Äôs annual fundraising event. It is designed to bring together nonprofits that benefit from The Women‚Äôs Foundation, donors, and others involved with The Foundation for an afternoon of raising money, networking, learning more about The Foundation, and celebrating those involved.  Focus areas and partnerships  Washington Area Women‚Äôs Foundation distributes funds primarily through grants for which local organizations apply. The Women‚Äôs Foundation also provides visibility and technical assistance to local nonprofits referred to as Grantee Partners. Since 1998, The Women‚Äôs Foundation has assisted more than 100 Grantee Partners who aid women and girls in the DC metro area. The Grantee Partners deal with a wide range of issues including: homelessness, healthcare, child care, immigration, poverty, rape, women‚Äôs rights, human trafficking, reproductive rights, home ownership, domestic violence, and job training. In 2005, The Women‚Äôs Foundation launched Stepping Stones, a multi-year, regional initiative with the goal of building long-term financial independence and economic security of low-income women and women-headed families. It's a data-driven strategy focused on single mothers earning between $15,000 - $35,000 per year. From July 2008 to June 2009, despite being in the middle of an economic downturn, Grantee Partners that received money from Stepping Stones helped nearly 1,000 women increase their assets by $2.2 million, helped 66 women become homeowners, and helped over 70 women increase their income by more than $600,000 due to job placements. The Leadership Awards is an annual program that invests in the work of outstanding, emerging community-based organizations that serve the critical needs of women and girls. It provides an opportunity for members of The Women‚Äôs Foundation community to volunteer in the selection of awardees through ‚Äúcitizen philanthropy.‚Äù Each year, 40-60 volunteers evaluate organizations that apply for the leadership awards through interviews and site visits. The volunteers then choose 10 nonprofits to receive Leadership Awards. An online vote opens up the process to the rest of the community, allowing anyone to cast a vote for the organization of their choice to get an additional monetary award. The Be That Woman movement stemmed from a video that was created for Washington Area Women‚Äôs Foundation by RP3 Agency. Debuting at the 2009 Leadership Luncheon on October 20, 2009, the video is an animated short that tells the story of a woman who receives assistance in a time of need and is then inspired to help others. Luncheon attendees were encouraged to forward a link to the video to others. The link to watch and share for the \\"Be That Woman\\" video, created by RP3 Agency is: Be That Woman, or http://www.bethatwoman.org.  Research  Washington Area Women‚Äôs Foundation also funds research and reports. In 2003, The Women‚Äôs Foundation published A Portrait of Women & Girls in the Washington Metropolitan Area (The Portrait Project)‚Äîthe first and only comprehensive look at the status of women and girls in the region. This groundbreaking study‚Äôs principal conclusion was that low-income, women-headed families ‚Äì single mothers and their children ‚Äì are, by far, the most economically vulnerable population in our region. The Portrait Project was the result of a two-year process during which The Women‚Äôs Foundation collaborated with a wide cross- section of community-based organizations, foundations, research institutions and individuals. An accurate ‚Äúportrait‚Äù of women and girls in the region, The Portrait Project has been a proven community asset for nonprofits, policymakers and philanthropists to better inform their programming and grantmaking.

In 1884, a judge fined Wyatt Earp $65 for claim jumping after he forced William Payne off his land at gunpoint near Murray. There was never a Northern Pacific line serving Murray. The line was built by the Idaho Northern Railroad in 1908. The Idaho Northern was taken over by the Oregon‚ÄìWashington Railroad and Navigation Company (OWR & N) on March 1, 1911. It served as a branch line from Enaville, Idaho until the 1933 flood washed out much of the line. It was then abandoned. A Northern Pacific railroad line served the community for two years during the 1910s. A post office was established at Murray in 1884, and remained in operation until 1959.

Background She was bred at Angus Glen Farm in Markham, Ontario by owner Arthur Stollery and raced by his wife Helen. By the stakes- winning mare Its Ann, she was sired by Kentucky Derby winner and United States and Canadian Hall of Fame inductee Northern Dancer, one of the most influential sires in Thoroughbred history. She was conditioned for racing by Jim Bentley from a base at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, Ontario. Racing career At age two, Lauries Dancer won two her eight starts with her best stakes race results a third in both the Mazarine and Natalma Stakes. As a three-year-old in 1971, she developed into the best horse in Canada, female or male. She won the 1971 Bison City Stakes in stakes record time at Fort Erie Racetrack and the Star Shoot and Canadian Oaks at Woodbine. United States and Canadian Hall of Fame jockey Sandy Hawley rode her to victory in the Canadian Oaks, marking his second of five straight wins in Canada's most important race for three-year-old fillies. Sent to race in the United States at Delaware Park, she came from dead last in a field of eight to win the Delaware Oaks. At Saratoga Race Course, under future U.S. and Canadian Hall of Fame jockey Ron Turcotte, she captured the Alabama Stakes by three lengths in stakes record time. In both races, Lauries Dancer defeated the 1970 American Champion Two- Year-Old Filly, Forward Gal. Lauries Dancer's 1971 performances earned her Canadian Horse of the Year honors. As a four-year-old in 1972, Lauries Dancer did not enjoy the same success but won the historic Maple Leaf Stakes. She won her final race in 1972, then in January 1973 was racing in the Miss Tropical Handicap at Calder Race Course when she went lame midway down the backstretch. Stud record Sold for $825,000, Lauries Dancer was retired to broodmare duty. She was bred to major stallions including Secretariat, Buckpasser, Vaguely Noble, Hoist The Flag, and Riverman. Of her nine foals, none met with her level of success in racing. Her value dropped considerably, and the February 23, 1990, issue of the Toronto Star newspaper reported that she had been sold in January 1990 in Oklahoma for $9,000. Standing at Margaux Farm in Midway, Kentucky, Lauries Dancer died at age twenty-three in March 1991 as a result of foaling complications. In 2006, Lauries Dancer was inducted in the Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame.

CGA Ontario also administers and delivers the CGA program of professional studies to more than 8,000 students, granting exclusive rights to the CGA designation in Ontario. About CGA Ontario CGA Ontario is headquartered in Toronto, Ontario. It is an affiliate of the Certified General Accountants Association of Canada (CGA Canada), the national accountancy body of CGAs in Canada, which comprises more than 10 provincial, territorial and international organizations. These organizations work collaboratively with CGA Canada as a federation. CGA Ontario is one of the three authorized designated bodies (CA, CMA, and CGA Ontario) in the province of Ontario that may grant public accounting licences to its members. The association was authorized by the Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario in June 2010. CGA Program Of Professional Studies The CGA program of professional studies is a multi-year process of accreditation through which individuals are granted the certified general accountant (CGA) designation. Competency-based Learning The CGA program is a competency- based curriculum that requires candidates to perform tasks and roles to standards expected in the work environment. The knowledge, skills and professional values required of a CGA are based on the CGA Competency Framework, a list of 130 competencies required of a newly certified CGA, under three general areas: professionalism, leadership and professional knowledge. The complete academic program consists of 19 courses, two business cases, and professional qualification exams: Foundation Studies, Advanced Studies, and PACE qualification. Online Delivery CGA Ontario administers the online learning environment on behalf of several CGA affiliate organizations program in addition to administering the program to students enrolled in the province of Ontario.

Administration of the association is conducted from the office of the chief executive officer. The association's 18 chapters are administered by an elected board of directors and chapter chair. History CGA Ontario traces its history to 1916, when CGAs living in Ontario approached CGA Canada (formed in 1913) with the proposal to form a branch in Toronto. By virtue of its size and rising industrial and commercial importance, Toronto had the greatest number of CGA aspirants outside Montreal, where CGA Canada was based at the time (its head office is now located in Vancouver). The Toronto Branch of CGA Canada was formed in 1921 and comprised 35 members. Its head office was located in the Traders Bank of Canada Building, at 67 Yonge Street in Toronto. In 1932, Ivy Thomas, a member of CGA Ontario, became the first female CGA and one of the first female professional accountants in the history of Canada. In 1952, CGA Canada amended its national bylaws to refer to provincial \\"associations\\" rather than branches, and Toronto Branch was officially renamed CGA Ontario. In 1957, CGA Ontario was incorporated by a provincial charter, and a number of provincial branches became \\"chapters\\" of CGA Ontario. In 1973, CGA Ontario became the first association of accountants in Canada to implement a mandatory program of continuing professional development. In June 2010, CGA Ontario was granted authorized designated body status by the Public Accountants Council for the Province of Ontario, enabling it to license CGAs in the province of Ontario to practise public accounting.CGA-Canada Applauds Advancement in Ontario Public Accounting (June 23, 2010). CGA Ontario is active in academic research and public policy. In 2010 it created the CGA Ontario Professorship in Accounting at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management. In 2012 it created the CGA Ontario Chair in International Entrepreneurship at York University's Schulich School of Business. In 2014, CGA Ontario joined the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants and Certified Management Accountants of Canada to become the Chartered Professional Accountants.CPA Canada This brought an end to CGA Ontario.

From 1973 to 2006, he served as a university professor (Chair of Zoology/Physiology) in the Faculty of Natural Sciences at the University of Kassel, Germany. Career From 1958 to 1965 J√∂rg-Peter Ewert studied the specialties biology, chemistry, and geography at the University of G√∂ttingen. He graduated in 1965 and took up the specialty of zoology under the direction of the behavior physiologist Georg Birukow. The subject of Ewert's PhD (Dr.rer.nat.) dissertation was: \\"The influence of peripheral sensory and central nervous system responses on the readiness of the orienting movement in the common toad\\". Later he passed the state examination for the lecturing at secondary schools. After 1966, he was a scientific assistant at the zoological institute of the Darmstadt University of Technology at Darmstadt. First he worked under the developmental physiologist Wolfgang Luther and continued under the sense physiologist Hubert Markl. In 1968 he received an invitation from the neurophysiologist Otto-Joachim Gr√ºsser offering him a research visit for neuron recordings at the physiological institute of the Free University of Berlin. He used the methodological knowledge acquired to begin recording neurons from the visual system of the common toad. In 1969 he obtained his Habilitation degree, the Venia Legendi for Zoology (focus on Physiology), at the Darmstadt University of Technology. During a research project 1970‚Äì71, he worked as a Fellow of the Foundations' Fund for Research in Psychiatry with the neuropsychologist David J. Ingle at the McLean Hospital (Harvard Medical School) in Belmont, MA, USA. From 1971-1972 he worked as a university professor at the zoological institute of the Darmstadt University of Technology. In 1973, Ewert became the chair of Zoology/Physiology at the Faculty of Natural Sciences at the University of Kassel. There he formed a Neuroethology team for research. During the foundation phase of the university, he was authoritatively involved in the construction of the students' science curricula in the biology program. In 1983 he was offered the chair of Zoology/Physiology at the University of Vienna. However, accepting the offer of the Minister for Culture of Hesse he opted to remain at the University of Kassel and worked there until his retirement in 2006. From 2000 to 2004, Ewert led an expert group of the Council of Europe as a representative of the European Science Foundation (ESF). The task of the Group of Experts on Amphibians and Reptiles was the revision of Appendix A to the European Convention for the Protection of Vertebrate Animals used for Experimental and other Scientific Purposes ETS_123. From the Expert Group Amphibians and Reptiles of the Council of Europe Document prepared Memberships For his scientific achievements research on amphibians in the field of neuroethology, Ewert was admitted as a fellow in the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). In 1993 he was nominated for the Max-Planck-Award. In August 1981, Ewert, as director of the NATO Advanced Study Institute (NATO ASI), organized the International Conference of Advances in Vertebrate Neuroethology at the University of Kassel (Venue: Schl√∂sschen Sch√∂nburg, Hofgeismar). On the occasion of this conference, the International Society for Neuroethology (ISN) was founded. Ewert was a member of the ISN Steering Committee.Ewert, J.-P.

Richard had one of the longest terms as lord, but it was during these years that Athenry came to decline. The succession crisis of the second Earl of Clanricarde and the subsequent Mac an Iarla wars, devastate his lordship, to the point where he admitted to Sir Henry Sidney that though his was the oldest Anglo-Irish lordship in Connacht, he and his people were reduced to penury; he was \\"as poor a baron as liveth\\". Two of the worst events were the 1572 Sack of Athenry and its destruction by Aodh mac Maghnusa √ì Domhnaill in 1577. While in the 1540s there were above three hundred prosperous houses in the town, there were by the 1570s less than forty, now of quality and many of their inhabitants ready to leave. In response to the unrest, Richard permanently shifted the location of the lordship to Dunmore, at the northern extent of his rule. The family would be based in the area henceforth, though still owning land and property in Athenry and its environs. Richard died in 1580, but was so insignificant that his death was not reported in the annals. He married Catherine O'Kelly, and had a son Edmond, 10th Baron.

He is a former Lebanese Labour minister in Najib Mikati's second government. He was one of eleven Change and Reform ministers, which is headed by General Michel Aoun, the largest share that it has ever had in government. Nahas is widely considered to be a Lebanese progressive whose priority has been to improve living conditions for the country's disenfranchised poor. He submitted his resignation to Michel Aoun on 21 February 2012, and was officially resigned on 22 February 2012, arguing that all of his colleagues in government were preventing any effective improvement in workers' rights. Nahas is currently the General Secretary of Citizens in a State, a new political party that was established in 2016 and that has as its goal to create \\"a civil, democratic, fair and capable state\\". Early life and education Charbel Nahas was born in Beirut on 16 August 1954 into a Melkite family. He graduated from the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris in 1976, and from the Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©es, also in Paris, in 1978. He also received a PhD in social anthropology in 1980. Political career Minister of Telecommunications In November 2009, Nahas was appointed minister of telecommunications in the government headed by Saad Hariri. Several commentators at the time hailed Nahas' appointment as a victory for Lebanese progressives. Sources indicated that one of the factors that led the FPM to nominate Nahas was to participate in ongoing discussions in relation to the annual state budget and the national debt, which are priority issues for the FPM. In 2006, Nahas wrote that \\"[a]lthough most of the rest of the world has moved on from the attitude that had been prevalent in the 1990s, according to which privatisation was the solution to all problems relating to public finance, Lebanon still adheres to that old mentality, either as a result of intellectual laziness or opportunism. [...] What we need in Lebanon is a 'better state', and not a 'lesser state'.\\" Subsequent reports indicate that Nahas supports the part-privatization of the telecom sector to a consortium of companies while ensuring that the government and the Lebanese public retains a stake. On 11 December 2009, Nahas announced that his ministry plans to create facilities to provide at least 90% of regions in Lebanon with broadband internet access. In November 2009, Nahas was appointed to the committee responsible for drafting the new government's policy statement. In the committee's first meeting, he called for Lebanon's economic system to be reformed, saying that \\"it is outdated. The Taef Agreement did not meet the requirements needed.\\" During the summer of 2010, Nahas raised a number of objections in cabinet meetings to the draft budget law that was proposed by Finance Minister Raya Haffar al-Hassan. In particular, he objected to what he described as the proposed law's failure to address Lebanon's basic economic difficulties (which manifested themselves in the form of high unemployment and emigration) at a time of relatively favorable circumstances (including a spectacular increase in capital in-flows since 2008). Nahas proposed a number of changes to the draft budget law that would reduce the burdens on employment and on income, as well as increased investment in a modern public transport system in Lebanon. He has also insisted on a number of methodological changes, including the elimination of all off-balance sheet expenses. The draft budget law was eventually approved by the Cabinet, including by Nahas, on 19 June 2010. Nahas subsequently led efforts to investigate and dismantle an alleged Israeli espionage operation which had infiltrated the Lebanese telecommunications network. Ashraf Rifi, then a general in the Internal Security Forces, prevented Nahas from accessing the facility. Rifi ignored then Minister of Interior Ziad Baroud instructions to allow Nahas to access the facility, prompting Baroud to resign. As minister of telecommunications, Nahas set as one of his goals to modernise the Lebanese telecom sector, which at the time was ranked as amongst the least competitive and the least developed in the world. Early in his tenure, his Ministry entered into a number of agreements for the creation a 3.9G network in Lebanon, and also commenced work on the installation of a fibre optics network. The 3G network was officially launched in October 2011, while the fibre optics network is set for completion in 2012. During Nahas' tenure, a number of measures to reduce the cost of mobile phones for less advantaged citizens were introduced. Amongst other things, the cost of purchasing a prepaid mobile phone line was reduced from $100 to $25, a collect call mechanism was introduced, as was a \\"family and friends\\" measure, which reduced prices for prepaid cellphone subscribers. Minister of Labour 2012 cover of al-Akhbar newspaper that is captioned \\"Tragedy of a brave man\\" In June 2011, Nahas was appointed Lebanese minister of labour in the second government headed by Najib Mikati. Miqati is rumored to have vetoed Nahas' reappointment as Minister of Telecommunications. In his new position, Nahas focused on improving the rights of foreign domestic workers, on increasing the minimum wage in Lebanon and on granting health care to all Lebanese citizens. He argued that such measures are necessary to achieve greater social justice in Lebanon. Nahas put together a reform package during the fall of 2011, which had as its objective to ensure periodic adjustment of wages, in accordance with the legislation that is already in force, to redistribute revenue from rentier to productive services (by increasing taxes on real estate transactions), and to reinvigorate the role of the unions. Nahas' proposal included creating the basis for universal health care in Lebanon. That package was rejected by the Council of Ministries, a majority of which voted in favor of a plan put forward by Prime Minister Najib Mikati. Determined to see his plan come to fruition, Nahas referred the government's decision to the Lebanese Shoura Council, an administrative court, with a view to examining the decision's legality. The Council found in October 2011 that the government's decision was illegal given that it was not based on existing legislation. In December 2011, Nahas put forth his proposal to the Council of Ministries again, but Mikati once again put forth a proposal of his own. Even though Nahas won the vote this time, the Shoura Council rejected his proposal as it did Mikati's earlier proposal, on the grounds that as a Labour minister Nahas had no legal right to add transportation expenses to the minimum wage. Lebanon's General Labour Confederation threatened to organise its largest strike in history in reaction to the government's decision. In January 2012, the Council of Ministries approved two separate decrees relating to wage increases, over Nahas' objections. The first provided for a modest increase in the actual minimum wage, and the second reconfirmed the transportation allowance. Nahas refused to sign the second decree on the basis that it was in violation of the law and amounted to theft of workers' pension rights. In response, Prime Minister Mikati announced that he would refrain from calling the Council of Ministries into session until the second decree was signed. After significant pressure, including from his own political bloc, to sign the decree, Nahas opted to resign on 21 February 2012 rather than sign the decree. On 24 February 2012, Salim Jreissati, another nomination by Aoun, replaced him as labor minister. Citizens in a State In 2016, Nahas led the establishment of Citizens in a State, a new political party which has as its objective to establish a civil, non-sectarian state in Lebanon. He is currently its Secretary General. Since the 2019 popular uprising, Nahas and Citizens in a State have been leading organised political action against Lebanon's current ruling elite. Professional career Academic career Nahas was a professor at the Lebanese University for 12 years, where he headed the Civil Engineering Department. Nahas has also served as Distinguished Practictioner of Public Policy-in Residence at the American University of Beirut. Much of his work has centred around Lebanon's macroeconomic situation, in particular its sovereign debt, which Nahas has maintained is unsustainable. He is also the author of A Socioeconomic Programme for Lebanon, which was published by the Lebanese Center for Policy Studies in March 2006. Other Nahas is a leading social anthropologist and the author of many publications and studies on the Lebanese economy. He has acted as an expert for a number of Lebanese state institutions, as well as many international organisations, including the World Bank and the United Nations. Nahas was in charge of the reconstruction of Beirut Central District from 1982 to 1986. Nahas has contributed to development in areas including policy formation and public administration in Syria, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Iraq, amongst others. Personal life Nahas is married and has four children. Nahas is fluent in Arabic, French and English.

It was founded by David Morrisette in 1980, making it among the oldest wineries in Virginia. Containing 13 acres of land, the winery production has increased to approximately 60,000 cases per year. History Main Cellar William Morrisette began experimenting with grape growing in the early 1970s on the advice of the Virginia Tech Fruit and Science Department. After graduating from Mississippi State University's Viticulture and Enology program, David Morrisette returned to Virginia and ripped out the vines that his father planted. In 1978, William, Nancy and David Morrisette planted the first vines, starting the Chateau Morrisette Winery. Chateau Morrisette was one of the six wineries started in Virginia prior to 1980, making it one of the oldest wineries in the state. David Morrisette became Ch√¢teau Morrisette‚Äôs first official winemaker. In 1982, the first commercial wines were produced, beginning with approximately 1,500 gallons. The winery has 13 acres and wine production is now in excess of 60,000 cases. The Winery underwent an expansion and modernization in 1999, including a new wine production facility and hospitality center. Blue Ridge Timberwrights constructed a building from salvaged timber from the St. Marie River and from a Seattle warehouse to create one of the largest salvaged timber frame buildings in North America: with over 132,000 board feet of recycled Douglas-fir timbers. Production The production building houses over 160,000 gallons of stainless steel tank capacity, 50,000 gallons of capacity in French and American oak barrels, a twenty-two ton press and a bottling line with the capacity of 2,000 cases per shift.
