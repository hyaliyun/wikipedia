Terrestrial television viewing was estimated at 20% of total television households in 2011. IPTV is offered by Maroc Telecom. Digital terrestrial television is gradually spreading, with 41 national and foreign channels. The national broadcaster SNRT aims to complete digital switchover by 2015. Morocco has nine domestic free-to-air channels: seven government owned, one privately owned, and one of mixed ownership. 2M TV started out as the first private terrestrial channel in Morocco, in 1989, however it became a mixed ownership channel as 70% of its capital was bought by the government. It is by far the most watched channel in Morocco, cited by 84% of TV viewers. Medi1 TV (formerly Medi 1 Sat) is the privately owned channel, although 50% of its shares are owned by the public sector. The other seven channels are all government-owned. beIN SPORTS is the most popular pay-TV bouquet in Morocco, accounting for around 65% of the local pay-TV market. History Morocco was a pioneer in the Television field in the Middle East. In the 1950s, the country had a first experience undertaken by the French company \\"TELMA\\" who saw in the European community in Morocco a potential audience. In 1951, the authorization of exploitation and diffusion was ceded to \\"TELMA\\" which did not begin to transmit until February 1954. It was an experience that would only last a few months, the station ceasing its activity soon after covering the return of King Mohammed V to Morocco on November 16, 1955. The company had to stop, not because of a simple commercial failure but because of the political events generated by the nationalist movement that shook the country, and deprived the company of advertising resources, local advertisers gradually withdrawing their contracts for fear of possible reprisals, as reported in an interview Abdellah Chakroun, former Director of Moroccan Television, author of the book \\"Reflections on the audiovisual and theatre\\". According to the technical guide \\"World Radio Television Handbook\\" of the time 2, the \\"TELMA\\" emitted to standard 819 French lines (Standard E) since its studios of Casablanca settled in the district of Ain Chock. It had two transmitters, one in Casablanca on the F12 channel, the other in Rabat on the F8 channel (connected by radio link to the previous one) and planned to open two more in 1955 in Fes and Meknes. The main shareholders, the management and technical staff were mainly French, notably Jean Luc in the Programs Department, who had previously held this position on RTF Television. The programs were mainly of French origin, with magazines and varieties \\"kinescop√©s\\" (recorded on film), serials and films. In his book \\"Reflections on the Audiovisual and Theater\\" , the former director of Moroccan television Abdellah Chakroun also said that in 1960, the Moroccan government bought the \\"TELMA\\" for the symbolic sum of 100 million francs, he then called on Italian public television RAI to help him set up his own public channel, which was set up at Mohammed V Theater in Rabat. The technical standard adopted was the 625 \\"European\\" lines (Standard B) with specific channels in Morocco (\\"M4 to M10 channels in band III.) Like\\" TELMA \\", it initially had only two transmitters, in Rabat (M10 channel) and Casablanca (M7 channel).http://archives.television.free.fr/TV/Afrique/Maroc/Telma/WRTH_Edition_1956_Maroc_TELMA.jpg The Moroccan public channel began on the day of the celebration of the first year of Hassan II's reign on March 3, 1962.

The status of the TVM has moved successively from the regime of legal capacity and financial autonomy to that of the public institution, and then to its integration into the central administration of the Ministry of Communication, with a subsidiary budget. In terms of resources, the TVM ensures the balance of its budget through a grant from the State, in addition to a contribution-based contribution indexed to the energy consumption of households, the surplus of revenues of the Autonomous Advertising Service (SAP), as well as miscellaneous and accidental revenues resulting from the income from its services.

The pact to carry out the invasion, concluded between James I and the ecclesiastical and secular leaders, was ratified in Tarragona on August 28, 1229. It was open and promised conditions of parity for all who wished to participate. James I reached an agreement regarding the arrival of the Christian troops with a local chief in the Port de Pollen√ßa, but the strong mistral winds forced the king to divert to the southern part of the island. He landed at midnight on September 10, 1229, on the coast where there is now the tourist resort of Santa Ponsa, the population centre of the Calvi√° municipality. Although the city of Madina Mayurqa (now Palma de Mallorca) fell within the first year of the conquest, the Muslim resistance in the mountains lasted for three years. After the conquest, James I divided the land among the nobles who accompanied him on the campaign, per the Llibre del Repartiment (book of distribution). Later, he also conquered Ibiza, whose campaign ended in 1235, while Menorca had already surrendered to him in 1231. While he occupied the island, James I created the Kingdom of Majorca, which became independent of the Crown of Aragon by the provisions of his will, until its subsequent conquest by the Aragonese Pedro IV during the reign of James II of Majorca. The first repopulation of Majorca consisted primarily of Catalan settlers, but a second wave, which took place towards the middle of the 13th century, also saw the arrival of Italians, Occitans, Aragonese and Navarrese, due to a legal statute granting the settlers possession of the property seized during the conquest. Some Mudejar and Jewish residents remained in the area, with the Jewish residents receiving official status protecting their rights and granting them fiscal autonomy. Background Majorca's geographical location was conducive to trade. The island had become a meeting point for traders from various Mediterranean coastal areas, including Perpignan, Maghreb, Genoa, Granada, Valencia and Catalonia. Eventually, a conglomerate was formed by Jewish, Christian, and Muslim merchants who transported and sold a variety of goods. Majorca was located in the boundary zone between Christian and Muslim areas, at a nautical intersection close to Spain, southern France, Italy and North Africa. The island served primarily as a trade interchange and transit point, and as a result the island's economy was inextricably linked with international trade traffic. It developed an active market, monitored by the Consulate of the Sea. Map of Barbary Coast made in 1630 by Gerardus Mercator. Map showing the territorial division of the Balearic Archipelago during the period known as the Oriental Islands of al-√Åndalus. In 707, the eldest son of Musa ibn Nusair, governor of the Umayyad caliphate in North Africa, landed on Majorca and plundered the island. In 903, the island was conquered by Issam al-Khawlani, ruler of the same caliphate, who took advantage of the destabilisation of the island population caused by a series of raids launched out of Normandy. After this conquest, the city of Palma, then still partially under control by the Roman Empire, became part of the Emirate of C√≥rdoba in al-Andalus. The last governor rebuilt it and named it Madina Mayurqa. From then on, Majorca experienced substantial growth which led to the Muslim- controlled Balearic islands becoming a haven for Saracens pirates, besides serving as a base for the Berbers who used to attack Christian ships in the western Mediterranean, hindering trade among Pisa, Genoa, Barcelona and Marseille. The local economy was supported by a combination of stolen goods from raids on Christian territories, naval trade, and taxes levied on Majorcan farmers. Conquest of the island by Ramon Berenguer III Fos castle (Fos- sur-Mer, Provenza), by Mari√† Fortuny (1856 or 1857), Reial Acad√®mia Catalana de Belles Arts de Sant Jordi (on trust at the Palau de la Generalitat de Catalunya). In 1114, the Count of Barcelona, Ramon Berenguer, gathered a group of nobles from Pisa and other Proven√ßal and Italian cities, including the Viscount of Narbonne and the Count of Montpellier. This group of nobles launched a retaliatory expedition against the island to combat the pirate raids being organized on Majorca. The objective of this mission was to wrest Majorca from Muslim control, establish a Christian government, and thereby prevent any further attacks on shipping by Christian merchants. After an eight-month siege, Berenguer had to return home because an Almoravid offensive was threatening Barcelona. He left the Genoese in charge, but they ultimately gave up on the siege and fled with the captured spoils. Although the siege failed, it laid the foundation for future Catalan naval power and strengthened strategic alliances among Christian kingdoms around the Mediterranean. In Pisa there are still some remains that were moved from Mayurqa. There is also an account of the expedition in a Pisan document called Liber maiolichinus, in which Ramon Berenguer III is referred to by the appellate \\"Dux Catalensis\\" or \\"Catalanensis\\" and \\"catalanicus heros\\", while his subjects are called \\"Christicolas Catalanensis\\". This is considered the oldest documented reference to Catalonia that has been identified within the domains of the Count of Barcelona. The siege of Majorca prompted the Almoravid caliph to send a relative of his to take over the local government and rebuild the province. The new wƒÅli led to a dynasty, the Ban√ª G√¢niya, which, from its capital at Madina Mayurqa, tried to reconquer the Almoravid empire. King Alfonso II, using Sicilian ships, organised a new expedition and again attempted to conquer the island, but was unsuccessful. Almoravid and Almohad Empire Mapamundi from the geographer Al-Idrisi (1100‚Äì1162), who was born and educated in al-√Åndalus during the Almoravid period then moved, in the middle of the century, to the Normandy court of Roger II of Sicily. After the Count of Barcelona withdrew his troops, Majorca returned to uncontested Muslim control under the Almoravid family, Ban√ª G√¢niya. As a result of the Almohad reunification, he created a new independent state in the Balearic Islands. Trade between the various Mediterranean enclaves continued despite ongoing attacks on commercial shipping by Muslim forces. In 1148, Muhammad ben G√¢niya signed a treaty of non-aggression in Genoa and Pisa, which was revalidated in 1177 and in subsequent years. The wƒÅli was one of the sons of the Almoravid sultan, Ali ibn Yusuf, which meant that his kingdom had dynastic legitimacy. He proclaimed its independence in 1146. When G√¢niya acceded to the Majorcan seat, there were temples, inns, and sanitary conveniences that had been built by the previous wƒÅli, al-Khawlani. There were social meeting places and amenities as well as three enclosures and some 48 mosques spread across the island. There were also hydraulic and wind mills which were used to grind flour and extract groundwater. Majorcan production was based on irrigated and rainfed products ‚Äì oil, salt, mules and firewood, all of which were particularly useful to the military regime of the time. During this period, the Majorcans developed irrigation agriculture and constructed water sources, ditches, and channels. The land was divided into farmsteads and operated by family clans in collectives. Management and administrative functions were concentrated in Medina Mayurqa. Cultural and artistic life thrived, and the city soon became a trade centre between the East and West. Although the Almoravids preached a more orthodox compliance to Islam in Barbary, Majorca was influenced by Andalusian culture, which meant their religious precepts were less strict. Pressure from King Alfonso I and the emerging Almohad power led to a crisis in the Almoravid administration and, after the fall of Marrakech in 1147, it eventually succumbed to this new empire. In 1203, an Almohad fleet that was leaving Denia fought a fierce battle against G√¢niya, the last Almoravid stronghold of the Andalus period, incorporating Majorca into their domain. It was then ruled by different wƒÅlis who were appointed from Marrakech, until when Abu Yahya was appointed as its governor in 1208. He created a semi-independent principality with only a formal submission to the Almohad emir. Status of the Crown of Aragon Coat of arms of the Crown of Aragon. Having pacified their territories and having normalized economic recovery following the drought that began in 1212, the Crown of Aragon began to develop an expansionary policy. Also in 1212, the Muslims were defeated at the battle of Las Navas de Tolosa, an event that resulted in subsequent Almohad decline and allowed the Aragonese kingdom to reassert its power. A northward expansion was halted at the Battle of Muret, where the father of James I, Peter II of Aragon, was killed in combat. The kingdom then turned southward, seeing the benefits of having greater control of the Mediterranean. By then, James I was only five years old and, after a series of events, he was interned in the Templar castle of Monz√≥n, in the province of Huesca, under the tutelage of Simon de Montfort, where he received an education in a religious and military environment. Preparations James I's motivation to conquer Valencia and the Balearic Islands was driven by a combination of economic and strategic factors. Valencia was a rich land that could be used to provide new territory for the population of the Kingdom of Aragon, and Catalonia offered new fiefdoms for the nobility. The king of Castile, Ferdinand III, had tried to take parts of Valencia that were, in principle, reserved for the king of Aragon. Meanwhile, a conquest of the Balearic Islands enabled Catalan and Provence merchants to eliminate competition from Majorcan merchants and also dismantle the Barbary pirates who used Majorca as a safe haven. The taking of the Balearic Islands represented not only a retaliatory strike for the damage caused to the merchants, but also the beginning of a planned expansion to obtain a trade monopoly with Syria and Alexandria, thereby enhancing trade with Italy and the rest of the Mediterranean. It was after the success achieved in Majorca that James I decided that he was ready to conquer the kingdom of Valencia, which capitulated after the Battle of Puig in 1237.

Catalan Courts Assembly The Catalan Courts, an advisory council that met in December 1228 in Barcelona, discussed the desirability of carrying out a military campaign against the Balearic Islands or Valencia. The three estates took part in this assembly, in which the king guaranteed the Bishop of Barcelona the concessions from the churches on the islands. The Barcelona Courts of December 1228, an assembly at which the details of the military campaign for the island of Majorca were discussed. During this period, there was a group of families of the upper bourgeoisie who formed the minority leadership of the city. These families had acquired their power and wealth at the end of the previous century and were also the leaders of the city government. Their economic interests were connected to any future conquests of the monarch. In order to increase the profitability of their investments, they demanded more and more stringency towards their nobility or proprietary rights. Father Grony, the representative of the city of Barcelona, offered the king assistance from the city for this expedition. After that first assembly, there were others, until finally, the king had chosen the option of Majorca. The attack on Majorcan lands was already supported by tradesmen and businessmen, so only the support of the nobles was pending; their support was essential in carrying out the expedition. According to James I, it was the expert Catalan navigator Pedro Martell who encouraged him to embark on that enterprise during a dinner banquet that the latter held in Tarragona in late 1228.Llibre dels Feyts. Both the political and religious agenda of the enterprise were clearly defined in the discourses of the courts. James I opened his speech by uttering a verse in Latin, whose origin is not clear but which was often used in medieval times to seek divine inspiration for the rest of the sermon: \\"Illumina cor meum, Domine, et verba mea de Spiritu Sancto\\" (Enlighten my heart, O Lord, and my words by the Holy Spirit). James I suggested that the expedition would be a \\"good work\\". The church and the influence of religion in the reign of James I is manifold, his life and work reflecting the importance of Raymond of Penyafort, the Dominicans and Peter Nolasco, and the founding of the order of Mercy. According to the philologist Rafael Alarcon Herrera, the spiritual values of the Templars played a key role in the conquest. In 1129 the order had already included the Balearics in its list of territories to conquer a year before their recognition in the Council of Troyes. Thus, during the dinner, they apparently alluded to the monarch that the invasion was \\"God's will\\", a fact which may have encouraged the young king, given the connection of that house to his birth and education. In fact, much of the conquest was planned and executed by the Templars, proof of which is in the gift of the castle, the Jewish district, more than a third of the city and an exclusive port given to the order after the conquest. Possibly, the Templars provided James I with the best troops of those that took part in the conquest. James I himself narrates in Llibre dels fets, the conquest of the island of Majorca was presented to the Aragonese monarch by merchants at a dinner given by the navigator, Pere Martell in Tarragona. Financing and support from the nobility It is possible that, though the purpose of the dinner was to determine the necessary investments for the venture, the attack on the island was already decided. At that meeting, the Catalan nobles declared their support and offered economic and military aid to the king, each pledging a number of knights and foot soldiers. The collection of the bovaje tax, a tax on yokes of oxen paid to the king and used to fund military ventures, was also negotiated, as well as the signing of a peace treaty and a truce throughout the Catalonia region. In return, they would receive a share of the conquered lands proportional to the support given to the conquest; the king promised to appoint arbitrators for the distribution of lands and loot. The men who were appointed to lead the conquest were the Master of the Knights Templar, Bishop Berenguer de Palou of Barcelona, Bishop of Girona, Count Nu√±o S√°nchez del Roussillon (who, after the king, was the most important figure in the venture), Count Hugh IV of Ampurias, Catalan knights Ram√≥n Alam√°n and Ram√≥n Berenguer de Ager, and the wealthy gentlemen of Aragon, Jimeno de Urrea and Pedro Cornel. The king also requested a loan of 60,000 Aragonese pounds from the merchants, promising that it would be returned when the city of Majorca was taken, although it is unknown if they were given in gold or silver. Concerning assistance that the citizens of his kingdom could contribute towards the campaign, he remarked that he could not give them anything in return, since he had nothing, but that on achieving victory he would turn over property covering the entire length of sea from the beaches of Barcelona up to the beaches of Majorca. Consequently, in modern times, when the boundaries of a Catalan beachfront property are discussed, the owner technically controls the section of the sea from the shore of their property all the way to the opposite stretch of shore on Majorca. Participants Seal of the Knights Templars, with the well-known image of two knights mounted on one horse, a symbol of their initial poverty. The text is written in Greek and Latin characters \\"Sigillum Militum Xpisti:\\" which means \\"Seal of the soldiers of Christ\\". In the first meeting of the court, the operation was presented only for subjects of the Crown, but when the venture began to be considered as a crusade and to fall within a papal bull, it was open to all who wished to participate. Thus, private groups and Jews began to join. The Jews were called Xuetes and their importance was partly qualitative as they represented the industrial, commercial and scientific activity of the Crown. From his perspective, James I considered this set preferable to Christians from the nobility, who could become political rivals, so he focused on persuading this group of citizens to move their homes to new conquered territories, which served as a cornerstone for his policies as they were subjects whose contribution to the economy and the colonisation of the island would be substantial. The king's sympathy for the Jewish collective came from an early age. From when he was recognised as king in 1214, he had a Jewish doctor named A√ßac Abenvenist at his disposal. Besides taking care of his health, this doctor was once commissioned to obtain a temporary truce with the Muslims. The nobles and bishops who contributed goods and troops to the formation of the army included some nobles from the royal family, such as Nu√±o S√°nchez himself, Ram√≥n Berenguer IV's grandson, who took 100 knights. There was also Count Hugh IV of Ampurias who contributed 60 along with his son Ponce Hugo. Among the nobles there was also the most important magnate in Catalonia, Guillem Ram√≥n de Montcada who brought 400 knights along with his nephew. The members of the clergy also provided men, allocating 100 men to each company. The Archbishop of Tarragona, Asp√†reg de la Barca, and Ferrer de Pallar√©s, prelate of Tarragona (who later became bishop of Valencia), also took part, providing a galley and four knights, and became part of the king's War Council. It was not only the nobles and prelates who were committed to the venture, but also free men and cities, and Catalans were not the only ones who provided ships and financial support to the cause.Montpellier, Narbona, Marsella and G√©nova also participated and subsequently obtained profits from the conquest. Barcelona, which along with Tortosa and Tarragona had been the most affected by piracy, had a major role in the meetings of the Court, as demonstrated by the involvement of a significant number of its citizens. Berenguer Gerard and Pedro Grony were directly involved in the talks and Berenguer Durfort, a member of a powerful merchant family, was appointed the first mayor of the City of Majorca after the conquest. The venture was presented as a crusade against the infidels, like that undertaken against Pe√±√≠scola following other courts held in Tortosa in 1225. King James took the cross in Lleida in April 1229.Lomax Although the conquest was primarily initiated by the Catalans, there was collaboration with many other cities and towns in Provence ‚Äì Montpellier, Marseilles, and Narbonne, or Italian cities such as Genoa.La forja dels Pa√Øsos Catalans The cities of Tortosa, Tarragona, and Barcelona, the most affected by the pillaging of pirates, were the ones who offered the most ships. Ram√≥n de Plegamans, a wealthy businessman in the royal service, was in charge of preparing the fleet,According to The Cr√≤nica de Bernat Desclot but later did not participate in the campaign. Although the lower class within the Aragonese cities declined to collaborate, in a meeting held in Lleida a few days after the Barcelona Courts, James I was able to get a number of Aragonese nobles to take part because of their vassalage links with the king. The Lleidans ultimately supported the venture, though at first it appeared that they would not participate, because like the Aragonese they were more interested in Valencia, a fact that James I subsequently took advantage of when preparing for the conquest of that Muslim kingdom. Finally, among the knights who embarked on the expedition, about 200 came from Aragon, of which 150 were provided by Pedro Cornel and 30 by Pedro de Lizana,Jos√© A. Sesma the king's chamberlain who was eventually appointed governor general of the island. Some of the Aragonese nobles who got involved had been part of the monarch's advisory board. Although they all followed the monarch in the conquest of Valencia, many of his mesnaderos settled on the island in order to receive benefits in the division of spoils, further promoting the repopulation of Aragon leading to extensive economic and social activity. Papal bull and final preparations Image of a manuscript from pope Gregory IX. Preparations for the venture intensified. Holding the papal bull that Pope Urban II had granted to James I's grandfather, Peter I of Aragon, in 1095, Pope Gregory IX dispatched two documents on February 13, 1229 in which he reaffirmed his power to grant pardons in Aragon to those men who would organise themselves into military groups against the Muslims. He also reminded the coastal towns of Genoa, Pisa and Marseille that a trade veto had been imposed on military materials for the Majorcans. In August 1229, the archbishop of Tarragona donated 600 cuarterasA cuartera is a dry measure which equates to approximately fifteen pecks of barley, and one day later, the king reaffirmed the promises of granting land. He also instituted prosecutors and received oaths from several knights. The rejection of the Aragonese caused \\"the Conqueror\\" great annoyance but, upon arrival in Barcelona, he was pleased that a powerful navy had been prepared. In addition to about 100 small boats, there were 25 warships, 12 galleys and 18 t√°ridas to transport horses and siege engines. Although the Catalan armed naval fleet had existed since the ninth century, even before the Castillian, it was James I who, during his reign, led it to demonstrate its true power. On the day of Our Lady of August, all the barons and knights of Catalonia, along with the king, travelled to Tarragona and Salou, carrying all their equipment ‚Äì guns, sails, rigging, ships and t√°ridas which were loaded with logs, flour, barley, meat, cheese, wine, water and 'biscuit', a type of bread that was re-toasted to harden and preserve it. Before leaving, the king, along with the nobles and his entourage, attended a Mass given by Berenguer de Palou in the Tarragona Cathedral where he also took communion, while the army took communion in a chapel that had been built at the port for that purpose. Most citizens of Tarragona came to witness the spectacle of the fleet's departure, gathering along the rocky cliffs rising above the sea. The ship on which Guillem de Montcada travelled was led by Nicholas Bonet and was ordered to be at the forefront, with captain Carroz to the rear, while the galleys were arranged in a circle surrounding the transport ships to safeguard them. The last ship to set sail was a galley from Montpellier which had originally been intended for the king and his knights, but at the last moment, a multitude of volunteers appeared and had to be boarded on the ship. Armies Christian army A very rough estimate of the Christian army, composed of aristocratic armies, would give the figure of 1,500 knights and 15,000 footmen, divided among the following: * Army of the House of Aragon, 150/200 knights. * Army of Nu√±o S√°nchez I of Roussillon and Cerdagne, 100 knights. * Army of Guillem II de Bearn i Montcada, 100 knights. * Army of Ram√≥n Alemany Cervell√≥ de Querol, 30 knights. * Army of Hug V de Mataplana, 50 knights. * Army of Berenguer de Palou II, 99 knights. * Army of Guillem Aycard and Balduino Gemberto, 600 knights and several ships. * Army of Hug IV of Emp√∫ries, 50 knights. * Army of the bishop of Girona, Guillem de Montgr√≠, 100 knights. * Army of the Abbott of Sant Feliu de Gu√≠xols, Bernat Descoll. * Army of the provost of the archbishop of Tarragona, Esp√°rago de la Barca, 100 knights and 1,000 lancers. * Army of the Knights Templar. * Army of the Knights of Malta. * Army of Guillem I de Cervell√≥, 100 knights. * Army of Ferrer de San Mart√≠n, 100 knights. * Army of Ram√≥n II de Montcada, 25/50 knights. * Army of Ramon Berenguer de √Åger, 50 knights. * Army of Gal√ßeran de Pin√≥s, 50 knights. * Army of Bernat de Santa Eug√®nia, 30 knights. * Army of Guillem de Claramunt, 30 knights. * Army of Raimundo Alam√°n, 30 knights. * Army of Pedro Cornel, 150 soldiers. * Army of Gilabert de Cruilles, 30 knights. Muslim army According to various accounts, the Muslim king of the island, Abu Yahya, had between 18,000 and 42,000 men, and between 2,000 and 5,000 horses. The weaponry of the Muslims did not differ much from those of the Christians ‚Äì meshes, spears, mallets, arrows and leather shields resistant to swords. As evidenced from a display at the Museum of Catalan Art, one of the widely used Muslim weapons from the battlements was the Fustibalus, similar to a slingshot contraption, whose bands were tied to a wooden stick. The Muslims also had catapults and low shot machines, called algarradas by James I, which were very light, rapid, and capable of destroying several enemy tents at once.

Municipality of Andrach. Santa Ponsa bay with the Puch de Galatz√≥ mountain in the background. The photo was taken from the location of the landing. The expedition left for Majorca from Salou, Cambrils and Tarragona on September 5, 1229, with a fleet of over 150 vessels, the majority of which were Catalan. Various sources indicate an armed contingent of between 800 and 1,500 men and 15,000 soldiers.The majority of sources indicate 800 knights, but Jos√© A. Sesma places it at 720. The Muslim king of the island, Ab√∫ Yahya, had between 18,000 and 42,000 men and between 2,000 and 5,000 horses (according to various reports) and received no military support, neither from the peninsula, nor from North Africa, by which they tried to hinder the Christian advance towards the capital as much as possible. Some of the Christian ships were built at the expense of the Crown, but most of them were private contributions. Because of his experience and knowledge of the Balearics, Peter Martell was appointed head of the fleet, while Guillem de Montcada, who previously had asked the king to allow him to take charge of the mission because of the risk that the enterprise entailed, served as lieutenant, all under the command of James I, who due to his enthusiasm did not allow impositions and rejected the petition. The royal vessel, heading the fleet, was skippered by Nicholas Bonet, followed by the vessels of Bearne, Martell and Carroz in that order. The journey to the island was hampered by a severe storm that nearly caused the convoy to retreat. After three days, between Friday September 7 and part of Saturday, the entire Christian fleet arrived at Pantaleu island, located on the coast of the present-day town of San Telmo, a hamlet belonging to the municipality of present-day Andrach. James I's forces were not bothered by the possible threat of early conflict with the Muslim fleet, but the storm was so harsh that in the midst of the tempest the king swore to Santa Maria that he would build a cathedral to venerate her if their lives were spared. Local tradition has it that the first royal mass was held on this island and that a water trough where the king watered his horse was kept there, but in 1868 it was destroyed by revolutionaries who wanted to eliminate the vestiges of the former feudal system. While the Christians were preparing to begin the assault, Ab√∫ Yahya had to suppress a revolt that had been caused by his uncle, Abu Has Ibn Sayri, and as a reprimand was preparing to execute 50 of the rioters, but the governor pardoned them so they could help in the defence work. However, once pardoned they left Medina Mayurqa for their homes; some of them preferred to side with the Christians, as was the case of Ali de Pantaleu, also known as \\"Ali de la Palomera\\" or by Ben Abed, a Muslim who provided supplies to James I for three months. Battle of Portop√≠ Battle of Portop√≠. Fragments of the mural paintings of the conquest of Mallorca from the Palacio Aguilar in Barcelona, conserved in the Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya. Dated: 1285‚Äì1290 A Moroccan Army with a Christian Banner. Monument at the site where Guillem and Ramon Montcada died in combat, now part of the Paseo Calvia network, near the present tourist resort of Palmanova. The battle of Portop√≠ was the main armed conflict in open terrain between the Christian troops of James I and the Muslim troops of Ab√∫ Yahya in the conquest. It took place on September 12 at various points on the Na Bourgeois mountains (formerly called Portop√≠ highlands), about halfway between Santa Ponsa and the City of Majorca, an area known locally as the \\"Coll de sa Batalla\\". Though the Christians were victorious, they suffered significant casualties, including Guillem II de Bearne and his nephew Ram√≥n, whose relation to each other had previously given as brothers, so they were usually referred to as \\"the Montcada brothers\\". Before the start of the skirmish, the Muslim army had been deployed throughout the Portop√≠ highlands, knowing that the Christians would have to cross these mountains on their way to Medina Mayurqa. On the other hand, hours before the confrontation and aware of the danger that threatened them, Guillem de Montcada and Nu√±o S√°nchez debated who would lead the vanguard of troops; in the end it was Montcada. However, they penetrated the Muslim defense awkwardly, falling into an ambush that left them completely surrounded, until they were killed. James I, who was unaware at the time of their deaths, followed the same route, advancing with the rest of the army, intending to join them and participate in the fray with them, until he came upon the enemy in the mountains. The Montcadas' bodies were found disfigured by multiple injuries and they were interred in rich caskets at the Santes Creus monastery in the present municipality of Aiguam√∫rcia, in the province of Tarragona. According to the chronicles of the historian Desclot Bernat, the Christian forces left much to be desired, as there were several times when the king had to insist that his men enter the battle, even admonishing them on two occasions when he exclaimed the phrase that later passed down into Majorcan folk history: \\"For shame knights, shame.\\" Finally, the military superiority of the Christians caused the Muslims to withdraw. When James I's knights requested a pause to pay tribute to the nobles who had died, the Muslims were left to flee to the medina where they took refuge. Desclot says in his article that only fourteen men were killed, probably relatives of the Montcadas, among them Hug Desfar and Hug de Mataplana, but only a few commoners died. At night, James I's army stopped to rest in the present town of Bendinat. The popular tradition has it that after dinner the king uttered the words in Catalan \\"b√© hem dinat\\" (\\"We have eaten well\\") which could have given that location the name. The news of the death of the Montcadas was given to James I by Berenguer de Palou and two days later, on September 14, they were sent to bury his remains amidst scenes of grief and sadness. Siege of Medina Mayurqa and the pacification of the island The siege of Medina Mayurqa lasted for more than three months. In this image, the assault on Jerusalem in the First Crusade. Grief over the loss of the Montcadas and the decision over the next location of the camp kept the king and his troops busy for the next eight days. From there, they moved and camped north of the city, between the wall and the area known today as \\"La Real\\". James I ordered two trebuchets, a catapult and a Turkish mangonel to be mounted, with which they subsequently began to bomb the city. The actual site of the camp was strategically chosen based on its proximity to the canal that supplied water to the city, but also for its distance from the springs and Muslim mangonels. James I bore in mind what happened to his father in Muret and, sensing that the siege was to extend longer than anticipated, ordered the construction of a fence around the camp that would ensure the safety of his troops. The trebuchet, a siege engine from the medieval era, that could launch some two projectiles per hour at a target. While the Christian army camped outside the Medina, they received a visit from a wealthy and well-regarded Muslim named Ben Abed who appeared before the king and told him that he was in command of 800 Muslim villages in the mountains and wanted to offer all kinds of help and hostages, provided the king maintain peace with him. Along with advice on the practices of the besieged, this alliance represented powerful help to the Christians. As a first test of submission, Abed gave James I twenty horses laden with oats, and goats and chickens, while the king gave him one of his banners, so that his messengers could appear before the Christian hosts without being attacked. The response from the besieged was immediate and they answered with fourteen algarradas and two trebuchets. Faced with the unstoppable advance of the king's troops, the Moors tied several Christian prisoners completely naked on top of the walls to prevent it from being bombed. However, the prisoners instead screamed exhortations to their compatriots to continue firing. James I, hearing the pleas in which they said that their death would bring them glory, commended them to God and redoubled the discharges. Despite the discharges going over their heads, this caused the Muslims to return the prisoners to their cell, seeing that their blackmail was unsuccessful. In response to the Muslim ploy, James I catapulted the 400 heads of soldiers who had been captured in a skirmish (commanded by Lieutenant Vali, Fati Allah) while trying to reopen the water supply to Medina Mayurqa that the Christians had previously blocked. Knowing they were losing, the Muslims offered various negotiations to discuss the surrender of Ab√∫ Yahya. James I, in order to minimize losses, save lives and keep the city intact, was in favour of reaching an agreement, but the relatives of the Montcadas and the bishop of Barcelona demanded revenge and extermination. Ab√∫ Yahya then withdrew from negotiations as the king was not accepting the conditions. The Wali assured that from then on every Saracen would be worth twice as much. The king was left with no choice but to yield to the desires of his allies and continue with the campaign that culminated in the taking of Palma de Mallorca. Taking of Medina Mayurqa Hug IV of Emp√∫ries and Pero Ma√ßa, Lord of Sangarr√©n, during the conquest of the island. The strategy used to conduct a siege on a walled city usually involved encircling the city and waiting for its defenders to suffer from thirst and starvation. Due to the weather conditions on the island during that time of year and the low morale and energy of his troops, the king elected to break down the walls and assault the towers in order to end the venture as soon as possible. Among the various machines that were usually used at the time were wooden siege towers, woven wattles, battering rams, lath crossbows and trebuchets. After heavy fighting that lasted for months during the siege, the Christians began making inroads, knocking down walls and defence towers. The siege was so difficult that when the Christians opened a gap on one of the walls, the Muslims erected another wall made of stone and lime to cover it. One of the main strategies of the Christian attack was to use mines to destabilize the walls, but the Muslims countered with countermines. Finally, on December 31, 1229, James I managed to take Medina Mayurqa. The initial moment occurred when a gang of six soldiers managed to place a banner on top of one of the towers of the city and began to signal to the rest of the army to follow, while shouting, \\"In, in, everything is ours!\\" The soldier who went ahead of the rest of the troops, waving the banner of the Crown of Aragon on that tower and encouraging the other five to follow was Arnaldo Sorell, and was subsequently knighted by James I in return for his courage. The rest of the Christian army entered the city shouting, \\"Santa Maria, Santa Maria,\\" an act that was typical of medieval times. Pedro Marsilio indicates that 50 men launched their horses against the Saracens in the name of God, while shouting aloud, \\"Help us Holy Mary, Mother of Our Lord,\\" and again, \\"For shame, knights, shame,\\" while their horses butted forward and stirred-up the Saracens who had remained in the city, while thousands of others fled through the back gates. James' triumphal entry occurred through the main gate of the city, called in Arabic \\"Bab al-Kofol\\" or \\"Bab al-Kahl\\", and locally \\"Porta de la Conquesta\\", the \\"Porta de Santa Margalida\\", the \\"Porta de Esva√Ødor\\", or \\"Porta Graffiti\\". A commemorative plate was retained from this gate after it was demolished in 1912, years after the wall itself had been destroyed. In the Diocesan Museum of Majorca, there is a medieval picture with a fight scene in the altarpiece of San Jorge developed by the Flemish painter, Peter Nisart. It is said that, after taking the city, the Christians apprehended Ab√∫ Yahya and tortured him for a month and a half to make him confess where the pirates kept their treasure. They even cut the throat of his 16-year-old son in his presence, while his other son was converted to Christianity to save himself. Ab√∫ Yahya was tortured to death before he would reveal where the treasure was stored. At the same time, they burned the city and slaughtered the people who had failed to escape through the north door and had been left behind in the houses, although a few converted to Christianity to save themselves. The slaughter was so widespread that the resulting thousands of corpses could not be buried; as a result, the Christian troops were soon depleted by a plague epidemic due to the putrefaction of the bodies. According to the Chronicles of James I, though it appears to be literary information according to the epic atmosphere of the campaign, 20,000 Muslims were killed, while another 30,000 left the city without being noticed. On the other hand, in the Tramuntana Mountains and in the region of Art√†, they had managed to shelter some 20,000 people including civilians and armed men, but were ultimately captured by the Christians. Dispute over the division of the spoils As soon as they entered the city, the conquerors began to take over what they saw, and soon discord began to emerge among the troops. To avoid conflict here, the king suggested first dealing with the Moors who had fled to the mountains, to avoid a possible counter-attack, but their desire to seize the goods of the vanquished prompted the Bishop of Barcelona and Nu√±o S√°nchez to propose that a public auction be held. The spoils collected during the early days were abundant, with each taking what they wished. When it was revealed that they had to pay, they revolted, which ended in them storming the house where the pavorde of Tarragona had been installed. In response, James I ordered that they bring everything they had gotten to the castle where the Templars were settled. He then said to the people that the distribution would be fair, and that if they continued looting homes they would be hanged. The sacking of the city lasted until April 30, 1230, a month before the master of the house of San Juan had arrived on the island with some of his knights. He requested that, in addition to land, they be given one building and some property. James gave in to their demands and gave them the deracenal house, plus four galleys that the wali had captured from the island. Another of the problems that James I faced was the abandonment of the city by the troops once the military targets were achieved. Thus he sent Pedro Cornel to Barcelona to recruit 150 knights to finish conquering the rest of the island. Muslim resistance Location of the last pockets of Muslim resistance in Majorca. As a result of internal disputes among the conquerors over the distribution of the spoils, the Muslims who escaped were able to organise in the northern mountains of Majorca and last for two years, until mid-1232, when the complete conquest of the territory was accomplished. However, the majority of the Muslim population did not offer much resistance and remained disunited, facilitating the invasion. To combat pockets of resistance that had been organised in the mountains, several cavalcades were organised. The first one, led by James I, failed because the troops had little strength and were plagued with illness. The second raid took place in March, against the Muslims who had been hiding in the Tramuntana Mountains. A group of rebels were found there and they surrendered on condition that they agreed not to receive assistance from other Moorish groups who were in the mountains. While the Christians fulfilled the agreement, they took the opportunity to look for new arrivals. A detachment under the command of Pedro Maza found a cave where a large number of Muslims had hidden; the Muslims eventually surrendered. James I, having solved the major problems and eager to return home, decided to go back to Barcelona, naming Berenguer de Santa Eugenia as his lieutenant. Berenguer de Santa Eugenia later became governor of the island and was in charge of halting the Muslim resistance in the castles and mountains of Majorca. James I's return trip to Catalonia was carried out in the galley of the Occitan knight, Ram√≥n Canet, on October 28, 1230, arriving three days later in Barcelona to a reception with many festivities, as news of his victory had preceded him and his vassals wanted to extol him as the greatest monarch of the century. However, shortly afterwards, it was rumoured that a large Muslim squadron was forming in Tunisia to fight back and wrest control of the island. Thus, he returned to Majorca and managed to take the castles where part of the Muslim resistance was found: the castles of Pollensa, Santueri in Felanich, and the Alar√≥ in the town of the same name. The last stronghold of the Saracen forces was in Pollensa, within what is known as the castle of the King, located on a hill 492 metres above sea level. Once he had taken these fortresses and was convinced that no army would come from Africa to confront him, he again returned to Catalonia. During the period from December 31, 1229, to October 30, 1230, the towns located in the Pla, Migjorn, Llevant and the northeast of the island were taken. Finally, those who did not manage to flee to North Africa or to Menorca were reduced and turned into slaves, although a few managed to remain on their land. The last pocket of resistance caused James I to again return to the island in May 1232, when about 2,000 Saracens, who had taken shelter in the mountains, refused to surrender or yield to anyone aside from James I himself. Muslim perspective One of Majorca's leading historians and archaeologists, Guillermo Rossell√≥ Bordoy, worked alongside philologist Nicolau Roser Nebot in the translation of the first known Muslim account of the conquest of Majorca, Kitab ta'rih Mayurqa, discovered by Professor Muhammad Ben Ma'mar. The work, which was discovered in the late sixteenth century but was believed lost, was found on a CD in a library in Tindouf when, under the auspices of a patron, they were performing worldwide cataloguing and digitisation work on Arab documents. This contribution is the first time that details of the conquest became known from the point of view of the conquered. Its author was Ibn Amira Al-Mahzumi, an Andalusian born in Alzira in 1184 who fled to Africa during the war and who is believed to have died in Tunisia between 1251 and 1259. His account is considered to be of important historical and literary value, since it is the only document that recounts the vision of the campaign on the part of the conquered. In its 26 pages it describes previously unknown details, such as the name of the landing site, Sanat Busa, which in Arabic means \\"place of reeds\\". Ma'mar Ben Muhammad, professor of the University of Oran, carried out the first transcription and annotation, and subsequently Guillermo Rossell√≥ Bordoy translated it into Catalan in 2009. Since its introduction, it rapidly became a small best seller in the Balearics. Among other information, it confirms the presence of 50 ships in the Christian fleet as well as its detour through the Tramuntana coast, as it was spotted from coastal watchtowers by scouts who informed Ab√∫ Yahya. The Muslim & Christian accounts of the treatment given to the Muslim governor of Majorca do not agree with each other; based on the Muslim account, it seems that he was assassinated with his family without fulfilling the promises made in the capitulation treaty as the Christian accounts maintain. The Muslim account concurs with other details such as the capture of the Christian ships in Ibiza as an excuse for the invasion, the landing site, the Battle of Portop√≠ and 24,000 Muslim casualties. Distribution of land and property James I divided the island between the royal house, the nobility, the church, according to the Llibre del Repartiment. Image of James I in the City Council of Palma. At the time of the invasion, Majorca had 816 farms. The distribution of land and property on the island was complete and was performed as previously agreed in Parliament and according to what was available in the Llibre del Repartiment. King James I divided the island into eight sections, making one half the \\"medietas regis\\" and the other half the \\"medietas magnatis\\"; that is, half of the island passed into the hands of the king and the other half to the participating nobles or arbitrators of the distribution. Information exists only on the properties and lands composing the \\"medietas regis\\", which were what appeared in the Llibre del Repartiment, but it is believed that the \\"medietas magnatis\\" was similar.Salrach The groups that had the greatest participation in the enterprise were Barcelona and Marseille, the first with a total of 877 horses and the second with 636, followed by the house of the Templars which had 525. The nucleus of the island feudal system which James I installed consisted of jurisdictional units that were subject to the provision of a number of armed defenders called chivalry, although some of them, because of their relevance, seniority or importance to the successful bidding lord, came to be called baronies. The knights had a number of privileges that made them figures honoured by the king, mainly due to the nobility of their lineage and their kindness. Some of their rights and customs included that they did not sit down to eat with their armour bearer, but instead with some other honourable knights or gentlemen who deserved this privilege. However, the legal system allowed the cavalries to be leased or sold to third parties, even though they were knights, a fact which in return gave them lesser civil and criminal jurisdiction, permission to collect certain manorial rights or establish a clergy. Medieta regis and magnatis The medietas regis comprised about 2113 houses, about 320 urban workshops and 47,000 hectares divided into 817 estates. In turn the monarch divided this part among the military orders that supported the conquest, mainly the Knights Templar, the infants, officers and the men in their charge and the free men and the cities and towns. Thus, the Order of the Knights Templars received 22,000 hectares, 393 houses, 54 shops and 525 horses. The men in the service of the monarchAccording to Salrach, some 300 men. got 65,000 hectares. The citiesBarcelona, Tarragona, Marsella, Lleida, Girona, Besal√∫, Villafranca, Montblanc, Cervera, Lleida, Prades, Caldes, Piera, T√†rrega, Vilamajor and Argel√®s-sur-Mer. received 50,000 hectares and the infant Alfonso, his first-born, got 14,500 hectares. The medietas magnatum were partitioned among the four main participants, which in turn were to distribute the land among their men, freemen and religious communities. The four participants were Guillem Montcada, viscount of Bearn,Died during the Battle of Portop√≠. Hug of Emp√∫ries, Nu√±o S√°nchez and the Bishop of Barcelona. Origin of the conquerors The conquerors came from various locations and in different proportions, and so some of the current names of the towns are those of their masters, such as the village of Deya, named for the conqueror who was probably Nu√±o S√°nchez's main knight since this class of settlers was given the villas and castles. Similarly, other names were given, such as Estellenchs by the Estella and Santa Eugenia gentlemen, from Bernardo de Santa Eugenia. Thus, according to the Llibre dels Repartiment, the conquered lands were divided among people from Catalonia (39.71%), Occitan (24.26%), Italy (16.19%), Aragon (7.35%), Navarra (5.88%), France (4.42%), Castille (1.47%) and Flanders (0.73%). Due to the extermination or expulsion of most of the native population, there was not enough manpower to cultivate the fields, so the island's first franchise letters were issued in 1230 and offered privileges which attracted more settlers for the purpose of cultivation. The new Majorcan population came mainly from Catalonia, more specifically from the northeast and east, from Ampurd√°n, although there did remain a small Moorish population. As a result, the language of Majorca is an eastern Catalan dialect (which was already used in the texts of the Royal Chancellery by the Crown of Aragon, whose scribes included Bernat Metge, one of the most important figures of Catalan literature) derived in turn from Limousin and called Majorquin. Many typical Majorcan surnames, as they came into hereditary use throughout the various strata of the island in the thirteenth century, refer to the original lands of the first repopulators. Some examples are Catal√† (Catalan), Pisa (Pisa), Cerd√† (from Cerdagne), Vallespir, Rossello (Roussillon), Corr√≥ (the population of Valle Franquesas), or Balaguer and Cervera (towns in the province of Lleida). The toponymic picture of the island after 1232 was composed of various elements, such as anthroponyms, denominatives, phytonyms and geographic names, but the origin of many others are still unclear because of the permeability to all kinds of influences linked to the Balearic Islands from antiquity. It seems that, before the conquest, the Christian population on the island was low or even non-existent. A mosque, known today as the Sant Miquel church, had to be converted in order to hold the first mass after the taking of the city. This suggests that Christian worship and priesthood were non-existent before then. Majorcan historians say that during the long period of Muslim captivity, religion and the Catholic faith were never completely extinguished, given that the Santa Eul√†lia Cathedral, whose original construction predates the Saracen invasion, never served as a mosque, although it is unclear whether the troops of James I found any Mozarabic Christians. Menorca and Ibiza After the island was captured and annexed to the Crown of Aragon, James I dismissed an attack on Menorca because of the casualties suffered during the conquest of Majorca and because the troops were needed for the conquest of Valencia. At this point, they conceived of a strategy that would allow them to still gain Menorca. Ram√≥n de Serra, acting commander of the Knights Templar, advised the king to send a committee to the neighbouring island to attempt to obtain a Muslim surrender. The king decided that the Master Templar, Bernardo de Santa Eug√©nia, and Knight Templar, Pedro Masa, would accompany him, each with their respective ships. While the delegation started the discussions with the Muslim neighbours, in the place where the Castle of Capdepera now stands, James I ordered the building of large fires that could be clearly seen from Menorca as a way to make the Moors from the neighbouring island believe that there was a great army encamped there ready to invade. This act had its desired effect, causing the recapitulation of Menorca and the signing of the Treaty of Capdepera. After the surrender, Menorca remained in Muslim hands, but after the signing of the treaty of vassalage and the payment of taxes on the Miquel Nunis tower in the current Capdepera, on June 17, 1231, it became a tributary to the king of Majorca. The island was finally taken in 1287 by Alfonso III of Aragon. The conquest of Ibiza was appointed by James I to the archbishop of Tarragona Guillem de Montgr√≠, his brother Bernardo de Santa Eug√©nia, Count of Roussillon, Nu√±o S√°nchez, and the Count of Urgel, Pedro I. The islands were taken on August 8, 1235, and incorporated into the Kingdom of Majorca. The repopulation was carried out by people from Ampurd√°n. Consequences Cathedral of Santa Maria of Palma was constructed on the old mosque, as was the custom in that era. The Royal Palace of La Almudaina, next to the Cathedral, was reconstructed following the Gothic style of the era. Flag of the Kingdom of Majorca. At first, the new Christian city was divided into two parishes: Santa Eulalia and San Miguel, functioning as administrative, labor and spiritual centres. The latter parish is considered by Majorcan historians as the oldest temple in Palma because its construction was carried out on a Muslim mosque after the invasion, although with minor changes in the original structure to adapt it to Christian worship. Subsequently, Majorca was constituted as a territory of the Crown of Aragon, under the name \\"regnum Maioricarum et insulae adyacentes\\". At first they began using the Catalan system known as usages, or usatges, as the laws of the island, and the regime called \\"Universitat de la Ciutat i Regne de Mallorca\\"Established in the Carta de Privilegis i Franqueses of 1249, following the format of similar letters from Tortosa, Lleida or Agramunt. was also established for the City of Majorca. Medina Mayurqa was renamed \\"Ciutat de Mallorca or Mallorques\\" (\\"Ciudad de Mallorca\\" in Catalan) because James I endowed it with a municipality covering the whole island. Subsequently, the city experienced a period of economic prosperity due to its privileged geographical location, ideal for trade with North Africa, Italy and the rest of the Mediterranean. On September 29, 1231, contravening the pact with the nobles, James I exchanged the kingdom of Majorca for lands in Urgel with his uncle, Prince Peter I of Portugal, an agreement that was finalized on May 9, 1232, the prince being assigned 103 royal agricultural estates and serving as lord over the island. The criminal justice system began to make use of new tactics that gradually became imposing. In the letter of repopulation, archaic provisions were added, self-governance arrangements were admitted, and the aggressors who had been injured by the use of the word \\"renegat\\" (renegade) or \\"cugut\\"(cuckold) received impunity. It also allowed for the perpetrator and victim of a crime to agree to settle their differences via financial compensation. From the moment these provisions were added, due to the repopulation letters, there were notaries public. One of the first to hold this office, which had identical characteristics to those in Catalonia, was Guillem Company; this appears in an August 14, 1231 document. Both James I and the rest of the judicial lords established a notary that would document judicial and property acts within their jurisdiction, whose role came with financial compensation as perceived from the rates that corresponded to deeds authorized to the holder. Islam was oppressed after the conquest. Although not all Muslims remained in captivity, mechanisms were not provided for their conversion to Christianity, nor were they allowed to express their religion publicly. Those who collaborated with the invasion received special treatment and retained their status as free men and could pursue crafts or trade, and many others were sold into slavery. Soon, the beneficiaries were able to take advantage of the acquisitions. The Knights Templar were allowed to settle 30 Saracen families who participated in the olive harvest, and at the same time, through a pact with the Jews in which they guaranteed water supply, the latter were able to learn to draw navigational charts. Taxation as a public mechanism for detraction was still not formalized. The major source of income for the king was feudal in nature. Another source of revenue was payments from non- Christian communities by way of trade impositions. The mosque was used as a Christian church until about 1300 when construction began on the Santa Maria cathedral, known for being built closer to the sea than any other Gothic cathedral, and also for having one of the world's largest rose windows, popularly known as the Gothic eye.Most guidebooks on Palma present inaccurate information, in reference to the dimensions of the glass surface. There are some Gothic cathedrals in Europe with rose windows larger in diameter, although the glass area is less than that of Palma. Of the Strasbourg Cathedral with a diameter of 15 metres (see the book Merveilleuses cath√©drales de France, (Magnificent cathedrals of France), ), and also those in Notre Dame de Paris, whose northern and southern rose windows, built in 1250 and 1260, respectively, and have a diameter of 12.90 metres, see Notre-Dame de Paris. The city's water supply system consisted of ditches entering through the main gate and flowing to the royal palace. It was feudalized and became privately owned by royal grant, its distribution carried out through concession fees imposed by each owner. After the population decline resulting from the Black Death, pastoral activities were enhanced and helped to provide low-cost supplies to the local textile industry and improved their ability to sell products to Italian cities. The city did not lose its function as a transit hub for commercial shipping activity in North Africa. Although the Romans had introduced the craft of growing grapes for winemaking, the Moorish population limited its consumption based on Qur'anic prohibitions. Its cultivation was reintroduced and assisted by the Aragonese Cortes by way of a planting licensing regime, which granted a period of relative prosperity. The process of land occupation was slow. For 15 years after the conquest there were plots where only a quarter of the available land was cultivated, while most of the people settled in the capital city and its surrounding areas. In 1270, the indigenous Muslim population that had been conquered by the invaders was extinguished, expelled or replaced by continental settlers or slaves. After the death of James I, the kingdom, along with other possessions in southern France, was inherited by his son James II, who became the king of Majorca, independent of the Crown of Aragon until its subsequent return to the Crown. Some streets of Palma commemorate James I's name and this chapter of the island's history, including the Abu Yahya square. The \\"calle 31 de diciembre\\" (December 31 Street) crosses the square and refers to the date of the triumphant entry of the Christian troops into the city. Legacy Events Celebration of the battle between Moors and Christians in the tourist resort of Santa Ponsa, commemorating the landing made in the bay on September 10, 1229. In 2009, a tour with 19 panels in four languages was opened; known as \\"the landing routes\\", it involves a walk around the outskirts of the town of Santa Ponsa along three different routes: the Christian route, the Muslim route and the battle route. On September 9, 2010, during the commemoration of the 781 years since the landing, Carlos Delgado Truyols, the mayor of the municipality of Calvia, reiterated his support for historical approaches: \\"The conquest of Majorca, from the political point of view was not a Catalan conquest, but it was of a plural nature and involved Christendom.\\" He also reclaimed the Majorcan dialect of Catalan as the official language of Majorca. In 2010, the remains of a Berber woman of the era were found in the town of Arta. It is estimated that she had taken refuge in a cave with the keys to her home, along with more than two dozen people, who are believed to have been unaware that the island had been invaded three months earlier. The capture of the capital is annually commemorated during the \\"Festa de l'Estendart\\" on the 30 and 31 of December. This festival was declared \\"Bien de Inter√©s Cultural\\". Since the thirteenth century, it has been considered one of the oldest civil festivals in Europe. During the event, which usually results in protests by nationalist groups, a proclamation is made and a floral offering made to the statue of James I located in the Plaza of Spain in Palma. It is believed that the name of the festival refers to the soldier that placed the royal standard in the tower and told the rest of the Christian troops that they could storm the city. Literature In the folk literature of Catalan- speaking territories there is a wide range of stories and legends featuring James I, such as one that is told of the king attending a banquet held at the residence of Pere Martell. In the middle of the banquet he is said to have ordered them to leave his food and drink and to not touch anything until his victorious return from the island. Among his troops, James I also had the presence of Almogavars, mercenaries who lived for battle and war and are usually sold to the highest bidder. The attire of the Christian troops consisted of a hemispherical helmet reinforced by a ring from which a kind of protector for the nose could be hung. Their helmets were made of wrought iron plates that after a period of honing were often painted mainly to improve their durability, but also as a means of identifying the warriors wearing them. Art Monument dedicated to James I in the Salou porch. Its construction began in 1965 and shows an effigy of the Conquistador on a stone horse in a galley. Interior patio of the Palacio Aguilar. Although in the late Middle Ages the predominant architectural style of the bourgeois class was Gothic, both James I and the monarchs who succeeded him on the throne of Majorca were devoted to developing policies and promoting commercial maritime trade. The commercial character of this policy was developed by Catalans, Valencians and Majorcans, while the kingdom of Aragon was assimilated in part into the social and economic patterns of Castile, engaged in agriculture, livestock and the dominance of the nobility. Within Majorca there began to emerge a massive development of civil Gothic architecture which became abundant in the area. The rich and powerful bourgeois built palaces, held auctions and county councils contrary to the pretensions of the Aragonese monarchs. During the Christian conquest, many Islamic architectural works were destroyed and only the baths located in the garden of the Palma mansion of Can Fontirroig survive. Its construction date is estimated to be during the tenth century and some believe that it could have been attached to a Muslim palace. It maintained its well-preserved arches and 12 columns decorated with capitals of an uneven design and a square hall-topped dome. In terms of paintings, there have been many works of art made throughout the history of the island. Between 1285 and 1290, the reception hall of the Royal Palace of Barcelona was painted with images of the conquest; three canvases on which the cavalry, labourers, spearmen and archers are depicted have been conserved. There are also fragments of other paintings in the Palacio Aguilar, representing the meeting of the courts of Barcelona in 1228. With the intent of decorating its halls, the cultural society, the Mallorcan Circle, convened a painting competition in 1897 regarding the events on the battlefield during the conquest. One of two winning entries, entitled Rendici√≥n del wal√≠ de Mallorca al rey Jaime I (Surrender of the wali of Majorca to King James I), done on a huge canvas by Richard Anckermann, reflected the triumphant entry into the city by James on horseback and dressed in a coat of mail. The other entry depicted the surrender of the Vali.  Mysticism  In the Llibre dels Fets appear several mentions of Jaume I to the Divinity. For example, faced with the arrival to Majorca, says: Already for 2012, appeared a sequence evoking the event that was related to an own mystical experience.

Every little thing Marius (»òerban Pavlu) does is meant to serve one purpose only: to make the intended trip to the seaside with his daughter Sofia come true.

Director Radu Jude (The Happiest Girl in the World, A Film for Friends) expands on the theme explored in his 2007 short Alexandra in this bitterly ironic and intelligently choreographed drama. Marius‚Äô erratic movements beautifully illustrate his state of confusion. He turns from victim to aggressor, and the scene of this sudden transition displays both raw energy and directorial mastery.

He described himself as a \\"mathematician, consulting engineer, psychologist, educational consultant and practitioner, consulting psychotherapist, author, and poet\\".Brief bio of G. Spencer-Brown. Life Born in Grimsby, Lincolnshire, England, Spencer-Brown attended Mill Hill School and then passed the First M.B. in 1940 at London Hospital Medical College (now part of Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry). After serving in the Royal Navy (1943‚Äì47), he studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, earning Honours in Philosophy (1950) and Psychology (1951), and where he met Bertrand Russell. From 1952 to 1958, he taught philosophy at Christ Church, Oxford, took M.A. degrees in 1954 from both Oxford and Cambridge, and wrote his doctorate thesis Probability and Scientific Inference under the supervision of William Kneale which was released as a book in 1957.Spencer Brown, George (1957): Probability and Scientific Inference, London. During the 1960s, he became a disciple of the innovative Scottish psychiatrist R. D. Laing, frequently cited in Laws of Form. In 1964, on Bertrand Russell's recommendation, he became a lecturer in formal mathematics at the University of London. From 1969 onward, he was affiliated with the Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics at the University of Cambridge. In the 1970s and 1980s, he was visiting professor at the University of Western Australia, Stanford University, and at the University of Maryland, College Park. During his time at Cambridge Spencer-Brown was a chess half-blue. He held two world records as a glider pilot, and was a sports correspondent to the Daily Express.Cf. Spencer-Brown, George: Laws of Form, New York: Dutton, (1969/1979), S. 143 (About the Author). He has also written some novels and poems, sometimes employing the pen name James Keys. Spencer-Brown died on 25 August 2016. Laws of Form Laws of Form, at once a work of mathematics and of philosophy, emerged from work in electronic engineering Spencer-Brown did around 1960, and from lectures on mathematical logic he later gave under the auspices of the University of London's extension program. First published in 1969, it has never been out of print. Spencer-Brown referred to the mathematical system of Laws of Form as the \\"primary algebra\\" and the \\"calculus of indications\\"; others have termed it \\"boundary algebra.\\" The primary algebra is essentially an elegant minimalist notation for the two-element Boolean algebra, very similar to formal systems that Charles Sanders Peirce devised in work written in the 1880s and 90s (see entitative graph and existential graph), but in some cases not published until after the first edition of Laws of Form. Laws of Form has influenced, among others, Heinz von Foerster, Louis Kauffman, Niklas Luhmann, Humberto Maturana, Francisco Varela, and William Bricken. Some of these authors have modified and extended the primary algebra, with interesting consequences. Controversial mathematics In a 1976 letter to the Editor of Nature, Spencer-Brown claimed a proof of the four-color theorem, which is not computer-assisted. The preface of the 1979 edition of Laws of Form repeats that claim, and further states that the generally accepted computational proof by Appel, Haken, and Koch has 'failed' (page xii). Spencer-Brown's claimed proof of the four-color theorem has yet to find any defenders; Kauffman provides a detailed review of parts of that work., preprint available online.

Edwards, Regional manuscripts, 1200-1700 (2008), p. 74: \\"William Hatteclyffe, a Fellow of King's College, Cambridge, a doctor of medicine from Padua, and a signatory like Gilbert Kymer of the alchemy petition in 1456 seeking a quintessential remedy for the ills of Henry VI.\\" By 1461 Hatteclyffe had transferred his allegiance to the Yorkists, led by Edward, Duke of York, and after the Second Battle of St Albans of 17 February 1461, a disaster for the House of York, Hatteclyffe took ship for Ireland. His ship was captured by a French vessel, and he was held for ransom, but within a few days, in a speedy reversal of his fortunes, Warwick the Kingmaker had gained control of London and Westminster, and on 4 March 1461 he proclaimed the Duke of York king as Edward IV. The new king then provided funds from the Treasury for Hatteclyffe's ransom, and he was released. In January 1461/62 he was paid almost a year's stipend as king's physician, with effect from the previous March. In September 1464 King Edward IV sent Hatteclyffe on a diplomatic mission to Francis I, Duke of Brittany, and by January 1465/66 he had become King's Secretary. While continuing to serve as Secretary and also as a king's physician from time to time, Hatteclyffe was sent on many more diplomatic missions, especially to the Hanseatic League and Burgundy, Denmark and Scotland. Indeed, from 1464 to 1476 he spent a large part of his time overseas. \\"In particular William Hatteclyffe was constantly employed in negotiations with Brittany, Burgundy and the Hanse towns between 1464 and 1476, and spent a very considerable proportion of these years abroad.\\"Transactions of the Royal Historical Society (1936), p.96 In 1468 Hatteclyffe \\"Our Secretary and Councillor\\" alongside Richard Beauchamp, Bishop of Salisbury, successfully negotiated a marriage between King Edward's sister Margaret of York and Charles the Bold.Charles Lethbridge Kingsford, 'Hatteclyffe, William' in Dictionary of National Biography (1885-1900), vol. 25 In October 1470, when Henry VI briefly regained the throne of England, Hatteclyffe was one of those who was speedily arrested and imprisoned. However, on 11 April 1471 King Edward was restored, and Hatteclyffe was then released and promoted, not merely returning as King's Secretary but also being appointed to the Privy Council and as Master of Requests. In 1473 Hatteclyffe acted for Queen Elizabeth Woodville in business concerning her cousin Anne Haute. Secretary Hatteclyffe attended accompanied the king on a royal progression to France, a man-at-arms for protection, and 13 archers paid for three months. He received expenses of 2 shilling per day, as well as ¬£36 8s for his staff. In his were also retinue were a gentleman and servant. The following year he completed his last diplomatic mission. In 1478 he gave up his house in the City of London and took one in Westminster. In June 1480 he was joined as King's secretary by Oliver King, acting as his coadjutor, on account of Hatteclyffe's age and infirmity. Hatteclyffe died in the winter of 1480 and was buried in Westminster Abbey, but the date of his death is uncertain. He left property in Southwark, Deptford, Rotherhithe, and East Greenwich.

It is also known as annual kyasuwa grass in Nigeria, bare in Mauritania, and deenanath grass in India. It grows in its native geographic location, naturally spreading across the escarpment of the Ethiopian highlands.Smith, G. (2010). Ethiopia: local solutions to a global problem. Retrieved from http://www.new-ag.info/en/focus/focusItem.php?a=1784.

Description  Flower Desho is a herbaceous perennial grass which has a massive root system that anchors to the soil.SLM Ethiopia. SLM Knowledge: Technologies [Desho grass soil bund]. Retrieved from http://www.slmethiopia.info.et/slmknowledge/technologies/tech_report.php?questid=eth41. It has a high biomass producing capacity and grows upright with the potential of reaching 90 cm to 120 cm in height depending on soil fertility.Shiferaw, A., Puskur, R., Tegegne, A., & Hoekstra, D.

Desho is said to have high nutritive values and is naturally palatable for livestock.Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds,), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT.SLM Ethiopia. SLM Knowledge: Technologies [Desho grass soil bund]. Retrieved from http://www.slmethiopia.info.et/slmknowledge/technologies/tech_report.php?questid=eth41.  Geography  Desho is native to the humid Ethiopian highlands. It was discovered as a species in 1991 in the Chencha district of the southern region of Ethiopia.Welle, S., Chantawarangul, K., Nontananandh, S., & Jantawat, S. (2006). Effectiveness of grass strips as barriers against runoff and soil loss in Jijiga area, northern part of Somalia region, Ethiopia. Kasetsart Journal: Natural Science, 40, (pp. 549-558). It can grow anywhere from 1500‚Äì2800 m above sea level, but it performs best at elevations higher than 1700 m above sea level.SLM Ethiopia. SLM Knowledge: Technologies [Desho grass soil bund]. Retrieved from http://www.slmethiopia.info.et/slmknowledge/technologies/tech_report.php?questid=eth41.  Growing conditions  The technical specifications for cultivating desho are essential to improve grazing land management practices. Cuts of the grass are ideally planted in rows, spaced at 10 cm by 10 cm, using a hand hoe.Smith, G. (2010). Ethiopia: local solutions to a global problem. Retrieved from http://www.new-ag.info/en/focus/focusItem.php?a=1784. This spacing gives each plant sufficient soil nutrients and access to sunlight to achieve optimal growth, while ensuring the soil will be completely covered by the grass once established. It is recommended to plant other species alongside desho to promote biodiversity. Multipurpose shrubs/trees, for example Leucaena sp and Sesbania sp, can be planted approximately 5 m apart with no particular layout. Other legumes, such as alfalfa and clover, can be mixed in with desho by being broadcast throughout the plot.Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds,), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT. Once planted, maintenance activities such as applying fertilizer, weeding and gap filling, ensure proper establishment and persistence of desho.SLM Ethiopia. (2004). SLM Knowledge: Technologies [Improved grazing land management]. Retrieved from http://www.slmethiopia.info.et/slmknowledge/technologies/tech_report.php?questid=eth26. Fertilizer should be applied throughout the plot one month after planting. It is recommended to use organic compost in the form of animal manure, leaf litter, wood ash, food scraps, and/or any other rich biodegradable matters.Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds,), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT. After this initial treatment, fertilizer is only applied sporadically when desho plants are struggling to grow or where replanting has taken place. Weeding and gap filling are continuous activities. However, after 2 to 3 years, maintenance inputs decrease substantially or cease altogether as the grass cover closes up and the plot becomes a sustainable fodder source.Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds,), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT. Past interventions have shown that desho based grazing land management practices are best implemented and established when communal grazing land is distributed into small plots (less than 0.5 ha) for individuals to use, develop and manage.Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds,), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT.  Uses  Desho is used as a year round fodder. To maintain the sustainability of the intervention, the plot is permanently made inaccessible to free grazing livestock; instead a cut-and-carry system is encouraged.SLM Ethiopia. SLM Knowledge: Technologies [Desho grass soil bund]. Retrieved from http://www.slmethiopia.info.et/slmknowledge/technologies/tech_report.php?questid=eth41. Cut-and-carry means that desho is harvested and brought to livestock for stall-feeding.Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds,), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT. Due to its rapid growth rate, desho provides regular harvests, even reaching monthly cuts during the rainy reason. Once a year, just before the dry season, sufficient grass is harvested and stored as hay to feed the livestock until the rains return.Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds,), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT. One study assessed the effectiveness of another use for desho, the use of desho as grass strips, or hedgerows, to protect against runoff and soil loss on the slopes on the Ethiopian highlands. The results of the study showed that desho grass strips reduce soil loss by approximately 45% in the first few years of establishment compared to areas with no barriers. However, vetiver grass was found to be more effective than desho, and thus vetiver should be used as the preferred grass for hedgerow technology.Welle, S., Chantawarangul, K., Nontananandh, S., & Jantawat, S. (2006). Effectiveness of grass strips as barriers against runoff and soil loss in Jijiga area, northern part of Somalia region, Ethiopia. Kasetsart Journal: Natural Science, 40, (pp. 549-558).  Environmental impacts  The desho grazing land management intervention has significant positive impacts on the natural environment, particularly when biodiversity is improved. Desho is used as a rehabilitation method to overcome land degradation caused by overpopulation and unsustainable farming practices.Smith, G. (2010). Ethiopia: local solutions to a global problem. Retrieved from http://www.new-ag.info/en/focus/focusItem.php?a=1784.SLM Ethiopia. (2004). SLM Knowledge: Technologies [Improved grazing land management]. Retrieved from http://www.slmethiopia.info.et/slmknowledge/technologies/tech_report.php?questid=eth26. Desho greatly improves ground cover, which in turn controls runoff and soil loss. Moreover its massive root system strengthens the soil structure and improves water conservation capacities while effectively using deeper nutrients for growth.Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds,), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT. The application of trees and legumes alongside desho improves soil fertility by regenerating critical nutrients such as fixed nitrogen from legumes.Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds,), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT. However, most important for land rehabilitation is the change from overgrazing to silvopasture practices (combining forestry with grazing).Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds,), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT. In Ethiopian agriculture, livestock production plays a fundamental role for the livelihood of the people.Shiferaw, A., Puskur, R., Tegegne, A., & Hoekstra, D. (2011). Innovation in forage development: Empirical evidence from Alaba Special District, Southern Ethiopia. Development in Practice, 21(8), (pp. 1138-1152). Due to rapid population growth in the Ethiopian highlands, traditional communal grazing areas are increasingly being fragmented into cropland to meet growing demand. In turn, massive pressure is placed on remaining grazing land as overstocking cow and oxen leads to overgrazing and land degradation.Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds,), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT. This pattern negatively affects agricultural productivity and places a direct threat on the livelihoods of local farmers.Smith, G. (2010). Ethiopia: local solutions to a global problem. Retrieved from http://www.new- ag.info/en/focus/focusItem.php?a=1784. Implementing desho with silvopasture methods, such as cut-and-carry and biodiversity systems,Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds,), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT. protects grazing land from further degradation while increasing its productivity, and consequently improving livestock production.Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds,), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT.  Economics  The desho grazing land management intervention has significant positive impacts on the livelihoods of Ethiopian farmers. Ethiopia has the largest livestock population is Africa.IPMS Ethiopia. Dairy: A synthesis of IPMS value-chain experiences. Retrieved from http://www.ipms- ethiopia.org/content/files/Documents/publications/Commodity%20Case%20Studies/Dairy_synthesis.pdf. (pp. 1-11). Livestock production accounts for approximately 40% of the average household income of an Ethiopian farmer.Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds,), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT. Therefore, the increase in grazing land productivity leads to the increase in fodder (desho) production, due to high and consistent good quality yields, and consequently creates an increase in livestock production. The commercialisation and marketing of the animals and their by products then increases the cash income of the farmer and their family.Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds,), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT. Desho also provides a small business opportunity for Ethiopians. Various studies have shown that fodder is the key limiting factor influencing the growth of the commercial livestock production sector in Ethiopia as there is a critical shortage of consistent quality fodder.Shiferaw, A., Puskur, R., Tegegne, A., & Hoekstra, D. (2011). Innovation in forage development: Empirical evidence from Alaba Special District, Southern Ethiopia. Development in Practice, 21(8), (pp. 1138-1152).IPMS Ethiopia. Dairy: A synthesis of IPMS value-chain experiences. Retrieved from http://www.ipms- ethiopia.org/content/files/Documents/publications/Commodity%20Case%20Studies/Dairy_synthesis.pdf. (pp. 1-11). Thus, the development of efficient and sustainable for-profit desho plots and nurseries could be a good business model with the goal of selling the desho materials to local farmers. If fodder demands are met, commercial livestock production of the region could be promoted, raising the livelihoods of farmers and bringing more economic opportunity to the region.  Disadvantages of wider adoption  Wider adoption of desho is prevented by the inputs required. To start, the tools and cuts needed for planting require high cash inputs relative to that of free grazing. Moreover, fertilizers are needed for the proper establishment of desho, which are extremely costly under Ethiopian conditions, unless organic compost is used. Finally, the implementation, establishment and maintenance of desho require intensive labour, particularly in the initial stages of implementation and establishment.Danano, D. (2007). Improved grazing land management- Ethiopia. In H. Liniger, & W. Critchley (Eds.), Where the land is greener (pp. 313-316). Bern, Switzerland: WOCAT. However, the advantages of using a local sustainable technology seem to outweigh the disadvantages, as the spontaneous adoption of desho-based grazing land management has been very high among farmers in the highlands of Ethiopia.Smith, G.

The document includes only properties that were ceded to the monarch after the conquest of the island of Majorca in 1229. It meticulously recorded the houses or land donations made by James I to the Aragonese and Catalan nobles and ultimately to all who participated in the crusade for the conquest of Majorca. Of course, the properties had been expropriated from the Muslims who had previously inhabited the island of Majorca. This book is kept in the \\"l'Arxiu del Regne de Mallorca\\" in the city of Palma, but actually consists of two volumes: one bilingual in Latin and Arabic, and another in Catalan. The groups that had greater involvement in the company were Barcelona and Marseille, the first with a total of 877 horses and the second with 636, followed by the Knights Templar which had 525.

It celebrates the eelpout (or burbot, scientific name Lota lota), an indigenous bottom dwelling fish that inhabits the region's lakes, in some cases being found as deep as 300m. The fish itself is described as a cross between a catfish and eel, giving it a slender disposition but retaining a tapered midsection with a full complement of pectoral and caudal fins. While Lota lota is known locally as eelpout, eelpout also may refer to a family of marine fishes. Leech Lake is known for its exceptional walleye fishing, making this festival a banner for the often forgotten eelpout. 2018 location move As reported in September 2017 for a variety of reasons, the festival board is exploring the possibility of relocating the event to Lake Bemidji, an hour northwest of Walker. According to the Bemidji Pioneer, an application has been filed with the Beltrami County board, to proceed with moving the event north. History The first Eelpout Festival was held in February 1979 and ran continuously to 2019. Because of pollution concerns, 2020 saw the festival get scrapped. The celebration is held during one of the coldest periods of the year, and temperatures often reach well below zero. The events are designed to cater to a wide range of audiences and family activities are plentiful. Environment Leech Lake is well known among locals for its abundance of walleye, bass, Northern pike, sunfish and muskellunge. Eelpout are frequently caught only during the winter months. Leech Lake is the third largest lake in Minnesota covering 102,947.83 acres, with 195 miles of shoreline, and a maximum depth of 150 feet. Temperatures in February average a high of 25 degrees Fahrenheit and a low of 5 degrees.http://www.weather.com/weather/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/6744:21 References Category:Tourist attractions in Cass County, Minnesota Category:Festivals in Minnesota ","title":"Eelpout Festival"},{"id":"37942117","title":"Nicole Scherzinger videography"},{"id":"37942121","text":"Llibre del Repartiment refers to one of several land distribution documents which partitioned land acquired by King James I during the Reconquista.

A new gene is inserted into a cell using the AAV protein shell. Once inside the nucleus, the new gene makes functional protein to treat a disease. Alipogene tiparvovec, sold under the brand name Glybera, is a gene therapy treatment designed to reverse lipoprotein lipase deficiency (LPLD), a rare inherited disorder which can cause severe pancreatitis.European Agency Backs Approval of a Gene Therapy July 20, 2012 It was recommended for approval by the European Medicines Agency in July 2012 and approved by the European Commission in November of the same year. It was the first marketing authorisation for a gene therapy treatment in either Europe or the United States.Gallagher, James. (2012-11-02) BBC News ‚Äì Gene therapy: Glybera approved by European Commission. Bbc.co.uk. Retrieved on 2012-12-15. The drug is administered via a series of injections into the leg muscles ‚Äì as many as 60, all in one session. It is a one-time treatment intended to last at least ten years. Glybera gained infamy as the \\"million-dollar drug\\" and proved commercially unsuccessful for a number of reasons. Its cost to patients and payers, together with the rarity of LPLD, high maintenance costs to its manufacturer uniQure, and failure to achieve approval in the US, led to uniQure withdrawing the drug after two years on the EU market. As of 2018, only 31 people worldwide have ever been administered Glybera, and uniQure has no plans to sell the drug in the US or Canada. History Glybera was developed over a period of decades by researchers at the University of British Columbia (UBC). In 1986, Michael R. Hayden and John Kastelein began research at UBC, confirming the hypothesis that LPLD was caused by a gene mutation. Years later, in 2002, Hayden and Colin Ross successfully performed gene therapy on test mice to treat LPLD; their findings were featured on the September 2004 cover of Human Gene Therapy. Ross and Hayden next succeeded in treating cats in the same manner, with the help of Boyce Jones. Trials and approval Meanwhile, Kastelein‚Äîwho had, by 1998, become an international expert in lipid disorders‚Äîco-founded Amsterdam Molecular Therapeutics (AMT), which acquired rights to Hayden's research with the aim of releasing the drug in Europe. Since LPLD is a rare condition (prevalence worldwide 1‚Äì2 per million), related clinical tests and trials have involved unusually small cohort sizes. The first main trial (CT-AMT-011-01) involved just 14 subjects, and by 2015, a total of 27 individuals had been involved in phase III testing. The second phase of testing focused on subjects living along the Saguenay River in Quebec, where LPLD affects people at the highest rate in the world (up to 200 per million) due to the founder effect. Price After over two years of testing, Glybera was approved in the European Union in 2012. However, after spending millions of euros on Glybera's approval, AMT went bankrupt and its assets were acquired by uniQure. Alipogene tiparvovec was expected to cost around $1.6 million per treatment in 2012‚Äîrevised to $1 million in 2015‚Äîmaking it the most expensive medicine in the world at the time.Gene therapy approved in Europe for first time However, replacement therapy, a similar treatment, can cost over $300,000 per year, for life. In 2015, uniQure dropped its plans for approval in the US and exclusively licensed rights to sell the drug in Europe to Chiesi Farmaceutici for ‚Ç¨31 million. As of 2016, only one person had received the drug outside of a clinical trial. In April 2017, Chiesi quit selling Glybera and uniQure announced that it would not pursue the renewal of the marketing authorisation in the European Union when it was scheduled to expire that October, due to lack of demand. Afterwards, the three remaining doses in Chiesi's inventory were administered to three patients for ‚Ç¨1 each. Mechanism The adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV1) viral vector delivers an intact copy of the human lipoprotein lipase (LPL) gene to muscle cells. The LPL gene is not inserted into the cell's chromosomes but remains as free floating DNA in the nucleus. The injection is followed by immunosuppressive therapy to prevent immune reactions to the virus. Data from the clinical trials indicates that fat concentrations in blood were reduced between 3 and 12 weeks after injection, in nearly all patients. The advantages of AAV include apparent lack of pathogenicity, delivery to non-dividing cells, and much smaller risk of insertion compared to retroviruses, which show random insertion with accompanying risk of cancer. AAV also presents very low immunogenicity, mainly restricted to generating neutralising antibodies, and little well defined cytotoxic response. The cloning capacity of the vector is limited to replacement of the virus's 4.8 kilobase genome.

Á∫¢Âá§Ëèú hong feng cai There are two kinds: one that is green on both sides, and another with leaves that are green on the top and purple underneath. Both kinds are considered medicinal vegetables. Gynura bicolor is a perennial and therefore found for sale throughout the year, however, winter and spring are the best times to use the plant. Uses Gynura bicolor is rich in iron, potassium, calcium, vitamin A, and more. According to Chinese food grouping, Gynura bicolor is a 'cool' food, so the leaves are stir-fried with sesame oil and ginger (both 'hotter' foods) to achieve balance. The stems and roots of the plant can also be made into tea. Choose leaves with few bruises and without black stains. In Japan, Gynura bicolor is eaten as local vegetable in Ishikawa, Kumamoto, and Okinawa, blanched lightly and served with ponzu, as an ingredient of miso soup, or tempura. Propagation Taking cuttings is very easy. Toxicity It was said that it can damage liver. Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids, toxic to the human liver, have been discovered in Gynura bicolor. Weak cytotoxic activity was noted in an assay, validating that caution must be utilised when using Gynura bicolor.

His hobby, which later turned into a future occupation, was the manufacturing of improved paper bag. During that time, paper and grocery bags already existed, but they were cumbersome to store and fold. Adding to it, they had a v-shaped bottom, which prevented them from standing still while someone is packing. On June 12, 1883 he got a grant on a patent to invent a machine that will manufacture a square-bottom bag, from the U.S. Patent Office. He named his invention S.O.S. or the Self-Opening Sack because of the bag's ability to remain standing and open without the person's assistance.

Tradition, however, dates it on October 9, the day of San Dion√≠s. That same day the King distributed houses in the city and in Benimaclet, as was agreed in the siege, and the document was issued in the city. The \\"llibre\\" meticulously recorded the houses or land grants made by King James I to the Aragonese, Catalan, Navarre, English, Hungarian, Italian and French, i.e. all those who participated in the crusade that resulted in the conquest of Valencia. Recorded in this book are the affiliation of the recipient of the house or farm, where they came from and the goods assigned. Of course, the properties had been expropriated from the Muslims that lived there before. Some fled south with all their goods, to territories still controlled by Muslims, while others remained in the new Christian kingdom.

Early life Born in Boston on May 20, 1940, his father Samuel Magee Green was Dean of Fine Arts at Wesleyan University and descended from Samuel Adams, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States. His mother was also a university arts lecturer. During his childhood, his parents gave him a love of art and architecture, which led to him enrolling at the Rhode Island School of Design. However, bored with academic life, Green left after one year and moved to New York City, where he joined the local art scene. Contemporary art curator In 1962 aged 22, he was introduced to the avant-garde art dealer Richard Bellamy (1927‚Äì1998), owner of the Green Gallery on 57th Street. Amused by the coincidence of their names, Bellamy hired Green on the spot to man the galleries front desk. Art writer John Gruen later described Green Gallery as \\"An important stepping-stone for every major American Pop artist\\". After Andy Warhol's friend Ted Carey saw the works of James Rosenquist there - when Warhol was without a gallery, and still working as an illustrator - he suggested that Warhol try to engage the owner. In 1963 Warhol befriended Green in the gallery (assuming that Green was the son of the owner named \\"Green\\"), looking for an outlet for his artworks. Warhol and Green became friends, and Green displayed a few of Warhol's early works at the gallery. Green also acted as an assistant to one of Warhol's film projects, where they spent the summer on Long Island and in The Hamptons, persuading wealthy socialites to let them film naked models in their bathrooms. Green later appeared in Warhol's films Batman Dracula (1963) and Soap Opera (1964). After six months at the gallery, through his father, Green secured the loan of over 50 works of art, which he intended to exhibit at the Davison Art Center at Wesleyan University. The exhibition included Warhol pieces and other leading contemporary artists including Tom Wesselmann's Great American Nude #39, and Yayoi Kusama's Ten Guest Table. In 1965, Green left the gallery and at the age of 25 became director of the Institute of Contemporary Art, Philadelphia. Creating his first museum exhibition, he asked Warhol for what would make up the bulk of the exhibition works, which was also the artist's first retrospective. Green chose Warhol's S&H; Green Stamps as the 40x40cm invitations he sent out for the preview ‚Äì and for the design of the silk tie that he wore under his white Gucci evening suit. However, as Warhol was not signing anything that year, Green signed all of the invitations \\"Andy Warhol, 1965\\". In an exhibition space that nominally held 300 people, Green invited 6,000, resulting in the mass-mobbing of Warhol and Edie Sedgwick. After the exhibition ended, Warhol had left his original dealer Eleanor Ward, and signed with Leo Castelli. After three years, in 1967 having been refused permission to organise a campuswide sculpture exhibition at the University of Pennsylvania, Green \\"abandoned the philistines\\" and created an exhibition in the city's museum that included works by Barnett Newman, Tony Smith and Philip Johnson. The resultant success allowed him to return to New York City's art scene as an acknowledged master of contemporary art installation. Appointed a cultural adviser by the city's mayor John Lindsay, six months later in 1967 Green realised Claes Oldenburg's first outdoor public monument beside the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Placid Civic Monument took the form of a Conceptual performance/action, with a crew of gravediggers digging a 6-by-3-foot rectangular hole in the ground.Claes Oldenburg Guggenheim Collection. To then protest against the proposed redevelopment of Easter Island as a United States Air Force refuelling station, Green shut down the 59th Street Bridge and both lanes of Park Avenue to allow installation of a giant Moai head sculpture in the forecourt of Seagram's Plaza. The USAF redevelopment plans were stopped by Congress shortly afterwards. Socialite After being introduced to Cecil Beaton in the summer of 1969, Green \\"retired\\" from the art gallery scene from 1970 to accompany Beaton as his assistant around Europe. Through the noted British photographer, Green greatly escalated the breadth and power of his social network, making many new and influential friends. In 1971, the actress Candy Darling moved in with Green. In a note written shortly before she died, she referred to Green as \\"a true friend and noble person\\". Barbara Daly Baekeland In 1969, he met the married Barbara Daly Baekeland, with whom he started an affair. Green was later introduced to her son Antony, about whom Green was very unimpressed by his artistic capabilities. After six weeks, Green broke off the relationship, although Barbara was still obsessed by Green. She pursued him relentlessly, and when she returned to the United States that fall, walked barefoot across Central Park in the snow wearing nothing but a Lynx fur coat to demand entry to his apartment. In 1972, Antony killed his mother at her apartment in Chelsea, London. The 2007 film Savage Grace, starring Julianne Moore, cast Hugh Dancy as Green, who in one scene is involved in a M√©nage √† trois with Barbara and Anthony. After the film opened, Green wrote an article pointing out that elements of the film were factually inaccurate: Green then embarked on legal action against the film makers which was still unresolved at the time of his death. The case was ultimately settled confidentially by his Estate. Greta Garbo The well connected Baroness Cecile de Rothschild's summer home was located in Saint-Rapha√´l, Var on the French Riviera. In the first summer that he assisted Beaton, Green accompanied him to stay at de Rothschild's house. De Rothschild had been concerned for her friend, the by- then retired actress Greta Garbo, and so began vetting Green to be a new companion for her. On Garbo's 65th birthday -- September 18, 1970 -- de Rothschild introduced the pair at a birthday party he had arranged at his home in Saint-Rapha√´l. The following winter, 1971, de Rothschild invited Green to a party at his apartment in New York, which became the first occasion on which Green walked Garbo home. It was not until late 1972 that Green first entered Garbo's apartment, amazed to find that she permanently covered her artworks to avoid having to cover them when she was out of town. Green quickly learned that he and Garbo had little in common but a love of walking and of silliness; but they formed an immediate bond which would last 15 years. However, in all the years that Green knew Garbo, he never revealed that Mercedes de Acosta's sister Maria was his godmother; Garbo had cut Mercedes de Acosta off after the publication of de Acosta's tell-all autobiography, so Green never mentioned her name. Garbo later ostracised Beaton, after he claimed in his 1971 autobiography that the pair had been lovers. Whenever Garbo and Green were both in New York, they would walk twice a week, regardless of the weather. It is thought by some that Garbo wore many layers of clothes and large sunglasses to avoid notice. Garbo also stayed at Green's houses in both Fire Island, New York, and Cartagena, Colombia, both isolated locations. Their main relationship was undertaken by telephone. They had a regular morning call: At an early stage, Green informed Garbo that as an art dealer, he often recorded his telephone calls. Garbo made no immediate protest, and Green never violated the understanding that the recordings would not be exploited in any way during or after her lifetime. In the fall of 1985, while Green was in Colombia, Green's assistant spoke to a journalist working for the American tabloid newspaper, The Globe. On October 29, the headline read \\"Garbo to wed at 80 - bridegroom will be art dealer 30 years her junior\\". Upon his return to New York, Green rang Garbo to arrange a walk, to which she responded: \\"Mr. Green, you've done a terrible thing.\\" The relationship ended at that point, with Garbo's friends later adding that she had heard that Green had played their tape recordings over a dinner party, an accusation which Green categorically denied. After her death five years later at 11:30AM on Easter Sunday, April 15, 1990, Green learned that around that period, due to her failing physical and mental health, Garbo had also cut many other close friends out of her life. Green in his last will and testament bequeathed all 100 hours of the tapes, which make up one of the most important records of the last 50 years of Garbo's life, to Wesleyan University. Yoko Ono and John Lennon Green, an admirer of New York-resident Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama, met her flat mate Yoko Ono in the 1960s on one of his regular visits to their apartment. After Ono married John Lennon in 1969, from 1974 the couple became resident in Manhattan, and would regularly dine with Green. Green managed to obtain an invitation to President Jimmy Carter's January 1976 Inauguration, to which he invited John and Yoko as guests. In the summer of 1976, Green used his connections at the Cairo Museum of Art to get the couple access to an archaeological dig in Egypt. In the summer of 1979, Lennon named Green as Sean Lennon's guardian should he and Yoko be killed together. After the murder of Lennon in 1980, Green always spoke well of his friend, and would commemorate the occasion annually at Mortimer's dining club on East 75th Street. Preservationist For the last 30 years of his life from the early 1980s onwards, Green worked to preserve various ancient art installations around the world, including Bhutanese monasteries and Buddhas carved in the mountainsides of Sri Lanka. To expand and sustain his work, in 1997 Green established the Landmarks Foundation, by the time of his death one of America's leading organisations for historic preservation. About this work he observed: Death At the time of Green's death, the ICA in Philadelphia was planning an exhibition based on his 1965 exhibition of Warhol's work. The exhibition (titled \\"That's How We Escaped\\": Reflections on Warhol) ran at the ICA from April 21 to August 7, 2011. References External links *Landmarks Foundation *Samuel Adams Green Papers.

They are protected as a National Historic Site by the Japanese government. History Located on a hill measuring roughly one square kilometer, the site was excavated in 1928 by a team from Mie University under the direction of Dr Toshio Sato. The team found a total of 88 kofun burial mounds, of which 26 were relatively intact. The site was named the and was proclaimed a National Historic Site in 1932. However, by 1965 encroaching urban development had destroyed 81 of the kofun, and a movement was begun to preserve the remaining seven. However, in the twenty years it took to obtain official injunctions against further destruction and urban development, another three of the remaining kofun were destroyed. Despite official protection, a road was built directly through the site in the 1980s, destroying another two of the remaining four kofun, and physically separating the remaining pair. Takarazuka Kofun No.1 This is a keyhole-shaped tomb, with a total length of , making it the largest found in Ise Province. The tomb was unusual in that it had a small rectangular stage extending from one side, presumably for ceremonial purposes. The tomb is attributed to , the deified progenitor of the local Itaka clan and dates from the early 5th century AD. The kofun was re-evcavated by the Mie Prefectural Board of Education from 1999-2000, and numerous haniwa and other funerary objects were uncovered. These, as well as the artifacts uncovered in the 1928 excavations, are preserved at the Matsusaka City Cultural Center. Of especial note is a large boat-shaped haniwa, which is registered by the government as an Important Cultural Property of Japan, as well as haniwa in the shapes of single and multistory houses and of men in armor.

The island of Helg√∏ya is now more or less an abandoned village of picturesque wooden houses with a historic church that is used on special occasions. Some of the houses are still used as summer vacation homes. Name The island is named Helg√∏ya (Old Norse: Helg√∏y) since it is the location of the main church for the parish, Helg√∏y Church. The name means den hellige √∏y or \\"the holy island\\" since the first element helgi means \\"sanctuary\\" or \\"holy\\" and the second part √∏y is identical for the word \\"island\\".

She serves as Coolidge Professor of History at Harvard University, where she focuses on the history of Britain and the British Empire.  Early life  Jasanoff grew up in Ithaca, New York and comes from a family of academics. Her parents, Sheila and Jay Jasanoff, are both Harvard professors, and her brother Alan is a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She was educated at Harvard College before studying for a master's degree at Cambridge, where she worked with Christopher Bayly. She earned her Ph.D. at Yale with Linda Colley, completing the thesis \\"French and British imperial collecting in Egypt and India, 1780-1820\\" (Yale, 2002).  Career  Prior to joining the faculty at Harvard, Jasanoff was a fellow at the University of Michigan, through its Society of Fellows, after which she taught at the University of Virginia. Books =Edge of Empire= Jasanoff published her first book, Edge of Empire: Lives, Culture, and Conquest in the East, 1750-1850, with Alfred A. Knopf in 2005 and received mostly favorable reviews. In the London Review of Books, UCLA history and political science professor Anthony Pagden called the work a \\"brilliant contribution\\" to the historical investigation of the complexities of empire; in The Guardian, Richard Gott called it \\"a riveting and original book.\\" However, in The American Historical Review, University of Pennsylvania English professor Suvir Kaul said Jasanoff's history of \\"objects and individuals, no matter how lovingly recollected, do not add up to an argument that historians should think of empire as instantiating 'the essential humanity of successful international relationships',\\" and underestimate the \\"concerns of those peoples who were at the receiving end of imperial power, whether that power was exerted by Europeans or by the native elites who functioned increasingly at their command. Similarly in The New York Times, Columbia University history professor Mark Mazower found \\"a high degree of wishful thinking\\" in Jasanoff's casting 18th- and early 19th-century empire as less asymmetrical domination and more \\"the kind of happy cross-cultural fusion that we dream about today\\". =Liberty's Exiles= Jasanoff published Liberty's Exiles: American Loyalists in the Revolutionary World in 2011, also with Alfred A. Knopf. The book describes the trajectories of the approximately 60,000 loyalists who fled the American Revolution to relocate in other parts of the British Empire; some 8,000 of those who elected to relocate were free black people, but 15,000 enslaved people of African descent were also forcibly moved when their owners chose to go. Liberty's Exiles was widely and favorably reviewed. In The New York Times, Thomas Bender called it a \\"richly informative account,\\" \\"smart, deeply researched and elegantly written.\\" =The Dawn Watch= Jasanoff's 2017 book, The Dawn Watch: Joseph Conrad in a Global World, published by Penguin Press and in the UK by William Collins centers on the life and times of novelist Joseph Conrad. The Times lauded the book as the \\"Conrad for our time,\\" and The Spectator called her an \\"enviably gifted writer....her historian's eye can untie knots that might baffle the pure critic,\\" noting that she \\"steers us securely and stylishly through those latitudes where Conrad witnessed the future scupper the past.\\" In the judgment of the Financial Times: \\"This is an unobtrusively skilful, subtle, clear-eyed book, beautifully narrated,\\" while the Literary Review observes: \\"Written with a novelist's flair for vivid detail and a scholar's attention to texts, The Dawn Watch is by any standard a major contribution to our understanding of Conrad and his time.\\" Reviewing the book in The Guardian, Patrick French began: \\"The Dawn Watch will win prizes, and if it doesn't, there is something wrong with the prizes.\\" In The Hindu, Sudipta Datta wrote that Jasanoff's approach to Conrad makes for a \\"remarkable retelling of Joseph Conrad's life and work and its resonance with the present dysfunctional world.\\" In The Guardian, William Dalrymple named the book to his list of best holiday reads of 2017. According to the Wall Street Journal's reviewer, \\"'The Dawn Watch' is the most vivid and suggestive biography of Conrad ever written.\\" In The New York Times, Ngugi wa Thiong'O applauded the book as \\"masterful.\\" Thiong'O wrote that Jasanoff succeeded where \\"An Image of Africa: Racism in Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness,\\" Chinua Achebe's classic Conrad essay, had failed, specifically in bringing into clear relief \\"Conrad's ability to capture the hypocrisy of the 'civilizing mission' and the material interests that drove capitalist empires, crushing the human spirit.\\" \\"'The Dawn Watch,' Thiong'O wrote, \\"will become a creative companion to all students of his work. It has made me want to re-establish connections with the Conrad whose written sentences once inspired in me the same joy as a musical phrase.\\" As part of the project, Jasanoff blogged a journey on a cargo ship sailing from China to Europe. She also published an essay in The New York Times describing the portion of her journey in the Democratic Republic of Congo; the piece drew criticism. In a letter to the editor, Boston University professor Timothy Longman said the essay \\"reeks of condescension\\" and \\"continues the widespread practice of ignoring the voices of Congolese intellectuals, many of whom write about their homeland with nuance.\\" The Dawn Watch was discussed on Andrew Marr's Start the Week program on 6 November 2017. It was BBC Radio Four's Book of the Week. Awards In 2005, Jasanoff won the Duff Cooper Prize for Edge of Empire. She won both the 2011 National Book Critics Circle Award for Non- Fiction and 2012 George Washington Book Prize for Liberty's Exiles. She won a Guggenheim Fellowship in 2013 and in 2017, she was awarded the Windham‚ÄìCampbell Literature Prize, valued at $165,000. Jasanoff won the 2018 Cundill History Prize valued at $75,000 for The Dawn Watch: Joseph Conrad in a Global World.

Monotoca scoparia was formerly in the family Epacridaceae but now belongs to the family Ericaceae. Monotoca is an endemic Australian genus with 17 described species occurring in all states.  Description  Monotoca scoparia is a lignotuberous shrub that grows usually between 30‚Äì120 cm high. The alternating leaves are erect and prickly, and narrowly oblong to elliptic in shape. Leaves are 0.6-2.2 cm long and 1‚Äì4 mm wide. The adaxial (upper) surface of the leaf is dark green in colour and the abaxial (lower) surface in a pale green to whitish colour, with 3-5 prominent veins. Leaf tips are sharp and branchlets are rough to hairless. The male and female flowers occur on different plants. Flowers are tubular and white to cream in colour. Flowers in 2-9 clusters occur in axillary spikes or the lowermost occurs solitary. The corolla of female flowers is 1.3-2.8 mm long and the male corolla is slightly longer, 2‚Äì4 mm. Flowering occurs most of the year, from December to August. The fleshy, oblong fruit is yellow to orange. A distinguishing feature of the Monotoca scoparia flower is the corolla tube is longer than the sepals.  Distribution and Habitat  Monotoca scoparia is widespread across Australia with sightings recorded across the country in Tasmania, Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland and few in Northern Territory and South Australia. Monotoca scoparia is a common understorey shrub in dry sclerophyll forest, woodland and heathland. Monotoca scoparia occurs on well-drained sandy and rocky soils from sea-level to montane elevations in full sun to semi-shade. Tasmania has six native species of Monotoca. These species are all quite similar and can be difficult to distinguish. The most similar species to Monotoca scoparia is the Tasmanian endemic species Monotoca submutica, which can be described as Monotoca scoparia var. submutica. Monotoca scoparia and Monotoca submutica closely resemble each other, except the flowers of Monotoca scoparia are longer and flowering times are different. These two species also differ in habitat, where Monotoca submutica is widespread across southern and western Tasmania growing in subalpine forest and wet sclerophyll rainforest.  Ecological Importance  Monotoca scoparia and other heath species such as Epacris impressa, Leptospermum trinerivium, xanthorrhoea sp. and a variety of legumes make up the preferred diet on the Smoky mouse (Pseudomys fumeus) in New South Wales. Pseudomys fumeus is an endangered rodent. Studies found that Monotoca scoparia was a major food source for this species and therefore its presence is important for the survival of this endangered species as well as the other species that feed on it.  Cultivation  Monotoca scoparia is commonly used in gardens. Best results for the prickly shrub occur when established in gardens, located in well drained positions with full sun to semi-shade. Establishment will occur under existing trees. Monotoca scoparia is often used in gardens for hedging and regulating traffic.

Any failure occurred at any point along the path of a circuit will cause the end nodes to move/pick the traffic to/from a new route. Finding paths with protection, especially in elastic optical networks, was considered a difficult problem, but an efficient and optimal algorithm was proposed . Other techniques to protect telecommunications networks against failures are: Channel Protection, Link Protection, Segment-Protection, and P-cycle Protection  Path protection in ring-based networks  In ring-based networks topology where the setup is to form a closed loop among the Add Drop Multiplexers, there is basically one path related ring protection scheme available in Unidirectional Path-Switched RingUnidirectional Path Switched Ring (UPSR). architecture. In SDH networks, the equivalent of UPSR is Sub-Network Connection Protection (SNCP). Note that SNCP does not assume a ring topology, and can also be used in mesh topologies. In UPSR, the data is transmitted in both directions, clock and counter clock wise, at the source ADM. At the destination then, both signals are compared and the best one of the two is selected. If a failure occurs then the destination just needs to switch to the unaffected path.  Path protection in optical mesh network  Circuits in optical mesh networks can be unprotected, protected to a single failure, and protected to multiple failures. The end optical switches in protected circuits are in charge of detecting the failure, in some cases requesting digital cross connects or optical cross-connects in intermediate devices, and switching the traffic to/from the backup path. When the primary and backup paths are calculated, it is important that they are at least link diverse so that a single link failure does not affect both of them at the same time. They can also be node diverse, which offers more protection in case a node failure occurs; depending on the network sometimes the primary and backup path cannot be provisioned to be node diverse at the edges, ingress and egress, node. There are two types of path protection in Optical Mesh Networks: Dedicated Backup Path Protection and Shared Backup Path Protection  Dedicated backup path protection or DBPP (1+1)  In DBPP, both the primary and backup path carry the traffic end to end, then it is up to the receiver to decide which of the two incoming traffic it is going to pick; this is exactly the same concept as in Ring Based Path Protection. Since the optics along both paths are already active, DBPP is the fastest protection scheme available, usually in the order of a few tens of milliseconds, because there is no signaling involved in between ingress and egress nodes thus only needing the egress node to detect the failure and switch the traffic over to the unaffected path. Being the fastest protection scheme also makes it the most expensive; normally using more than double of the provisioned capacity for the primary because the backup path is usually longer due to the link and/or node diversity rule of thumb.  Shared backup path protection or SBPP  The concept behind this protection scheme is to share a backup channel among different, link/node diverse, primary paths. In other words, one backup channel can be used to protect various primary paths as shown on the figure below where the link between S and T is used to protect both AB and CD primaries. Under normal operations, assuming no failure on the network, the traffic is carried on the primary paths only; the shared backup path is only used when there is a failure in one of those primary paths. There are two approaches to provision or reserve backups channels. First, there is the failure dependent assignment or approach also known as restoration in which the backup path is calculated in real time after the failure occurs. This technique is found in early versions of Mesh networks. However, in today‚Äôs Optical Mesh Network it can be used as a re-provisioning technique to help recover a second failure when the backup resources are already in use. The down side to restoration as a protection technique is that the recovery time is not fast enough. The second approach is to have a predefined backup path computed before the failure. This approach is said to be failure independent and it takes less processing time to recover as compared to the failure dependent approach. Here the backup path is calculated together with the primary at provisioning time. Even though the backup path is calculated, it is not assigned to a specific circuit before a failure occurs; cross connect requests are initiated after the fact on a first-come, first-served basis. Since this approach can only protect from a single failure at a time, if a second primary path fails and at least a portion of its backup path is already in used, this path won't be able to recover unless restoration technique is in place for such cases. There is a general down side to both of the above approaches and is that assuming there is a link failure with several paths running through it, each path in that link is going to be recovered individually. This implies that the total time the last path on that link is going to take to be back in service through the secondary path will be the sum of all other previous recovery times plus its own. This could affect the committed SLA (Service Level Agreement) to the customer.  Path protection in MPLS networks  Multi-Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) architecture is described in the RFC-3031. It is a packet-based network technology that provides a framework for recovery through the creation of point to point paths called Label Switched Paths (LSP). These LSPs creation are between a head-end and a tail-end Label Switch Router (LSR). In the former case, the head-end router is the input or ingress router. In the latter case the tail-end represents the output or egress router in the path. There are a few protection techniques for MPLS very similar in the general concept to those for Optical Mesh Networks, such as link protection (e.g., MPLS local protection) and path protection. The path protection schemes for MPLS are as follow:  Packet protection scheme (1+1)  Packet Protection Scheme (1+1) This protection scheme is similar in a sense to Ring-based path protection and Dedicated Backup Path Protection (DBPP) schemes described before. Here, same traffic is transmitted over two, link and/or node disjoint, LSPs; primary and backup. The transmission is done by the head-end LSR. The tail-end LSR then receives and compares both traffics; when a failure occurs, the tail-end detects it and switches the traffic to the secondary LSP. As with DBPP in Optical Mesh Network, there is no signaling involved in this protection scheme. This technique is the simplest and fastest of all, but as it reserves and transmits packets on both LSP, it takes away bandwidth that could be shared and used by other LSPs.  Global path protection (1:1)  Global Path Protection (1:1) In this protection scheme, a primary and a backup LSP are computed and setup at the provisioning time prior to failures. The backup LSP does not necessarily need to have the same constrain in terms of bandwidth as the primary; it is possible to reserve less bandwidth on the backup LSP and not incur in packet loss when in use. This is because the bandwidth of the link is shared among the different LSPs and the reason why the previous explained protection scheme is not preferred. It is also true that the Backup LSP does not necessarily carry traffic unless the primary LSP fails. When this occurs, a fault indication signal (FIS) is sent back to the head-end LSR that will immediately switch the traffic to the backup LSP. The drawback in this protection scheme is that the longer the LSPs, the longer the recovery time will be because of the travel time of the FIS notification.

Life  Yervant Gobelyan was one of four children born to an Armenian family from Izmit Bardizag (Bah√ßecik). He was born in Rumeli Hisar, a district of Istanbul, in 1923. He received his primary education at Tateosyan School where he graduated in 1937. He continued his studies at the Armenian Esayan School and having graduated from there, never went to school again. He then became a grocery apprentice, auto mechanic, carpenter, and worked in many jobs. Despite the hardships, he never ceased to write. During the Second World War he served the Turkish army for four years. In the army, he met Haygazun Kalustyan, a well- known Armenian poet. Gobelyan also knew another respected Armenian poet Garbis Cancikyan in Samatya. These three poets regularly met at Taksim at the Eptalofos Coffee Shop where they discussed literature and critiqued one another. Gobelyan's first book of poems, Hopefully, was published in 1948. He along with Hagop Sivasliyan and Hacik Amiryan were one of the founding members of the Luys (Light) weekly newspaper. However, financial difficulties soon forced Luys to close down, after which Gobelyan was again forced to find another job. The newly established the Ayk (Dawn) daily newspaper in Beirut invited Gobelyan to become editor in 1953. He went to Beirut and continued his literary career by writing short stories and poems. In 1954 he returned to Istanbul to work for the Marmara newspaper. He went back to Beirut in 1957 and worked for the Spyurk (Diaspora) newspaper. He returned to Istanbul in 1965 and continued his work at Marmara. During this time, he also worked for the Jamanak newspaper.

The unit was established on 1 November 1941 and was responsible for protecting the southern part of New Zealand's North Island from invasion. The division was greatly reduced in size during 1943 and was disbanded on 1 April 1944 without seeing combat. History As part of the preparations for the possible outbreak of war in the Pacific, the defensive forces stationed in New Zealand were expanded in late 1941. On 1 November, three new brigade headquarters were raised (taking the total in the New Zealand Military Forces, as the New Zealand Army was then known, to seven), and three divisional headquarters were established to coordinate the units located in the Northern, Central and Southern Military Districts.Cooke and Crawford (2011), p. 262 Upon formation, the division in the Central Military District comprised two brigade groups. The New Zealand Military Forces were further expanded following the outbreak of the Pacific War. The Territorial Force (which comprised reservist personnel) was fully mobilised on 10 January 1942, and reinforced by 7000 men who had originally enlisted in the New Zealand Expeditionary Force for overseas service.Cooke and Crawford (2011), pp. 265‚Äì266 The role of the Territorial Force was to counter any Japanese landings in New Zealand, and it was organised into both mobile and fortress units. The Home Guard would support the Territorial units in the event of an invasion.Cooke and Crawford (2011), p. 268 In 1942, the three divisions stationed in New Zealand were transformed into mobile formations and renamed, and the Central Division became the 4th Division; the divisions in the Northern and Southern Military Districts were redesignated the 1st and 5th Divisions respectively. The 4th Division's inaugural commander was Major General Norman Weir.Cooke and Crawford (2011), p. 272 As of mid 1942, the main elements of the division were the 2nd Infantry Brigade, which was based near Palmerston North, and the 7th Brigade Group, which was located near Masterton. The division also comprised a number of supporting reconnaissance, artillery, engineer and supply units which reported directly to the divisional headquarters.Cooke and Crawford (2011), p. 274 All Army units stationed in New Zealand were held at a high level of readiness to respond to a Japanese landing throughout 1942, though beach defences ceased to be manned from August. In addition, Masterton was struck by an earthquake on 24 June; following this disaster the 1st Battalion, Ruahine Regiment (which formed part of the 7th Brigade Group) patrolled the town and had to recover its colours from a ruined church.Cooke and Crawford (2011), p. 276 Brigadier Geoffrey Peren assumed command of the 4th Division at some point in 1942 and held this position until 1943. Peren had commanded the 2nd Infantry Brigade during 1941 and 1942, and was both a long-serving territorial soldier and the professor of agriculture at Massey University.Cooke and Crawford (2011), p. 267 Weir subsequently served overseas as the commanding officer of New Zealand Troops in Egypt. The forces stationed in New Zealand were considerably reduced as the threat of invasion passed. During early 1943, each of the three home defence divisions was cut from 22,358 to 11,530 men. The non-divisional units suffered even greater reductions.Cooke and Crawford (2011), p. 279 The New Zealand Government ordered a general stand-down of the defensive forces in the country on 28 June, which led to further reductions in the strength of units and a lower state of readiness.Cooke and Crawford (2011), p. 280 By the end of the year, almost all of the Territorial Force personnel had been demobilised (though they retained their uniforms and equipment), and only 44 soldiers were posted to the three divisional and seven brigade headquarters.Cooke and Crawford (2011), p. 281 The war situation continued to improve and the 4th Division, along with the other two divisions and almost all the remaining Territorial Force units, was disbanded on 1 April 1944.

He was the fourth son of Alexander I, King of Georgia (r. 1412‚Äì1442), by his second wife Tamar of Imereti. There is no scholarly consensus regarding the duration of David II's tenure as some historians, such Michel Tamarati, place three different catholicoi named David‚ÄîDavid II or III (1426‚Äì1428), David III or IV (1435‚Äì1439), and David IV or V (1447‚Äì1457)‚Äîin the course of the 15th century, the chronology also accepted by the Georgian Orthodox Church. Others, especially Cyril Toumanoff, see in these three names one and the same person, a son of Alexander I. The confusion arises from the three chronological groups of documents, while the inconsistency in the numerals after the catholical names is because some historians, like Tamarati, omit the catholicos David of 859‚Äì861. According to Toumanoff, David, born c. 1417, was destined by his father for the church career at a young age and became, or was designated to become, a catholicos in 1426. In the view of Toumanoff, his tenure lasted until his death c. 1457, while the two other contemporary catholicoi, Theodore and Shio, mentioned in the years 1427‚Äì1434 and 1440‚Äì1446, respectively, were his locum tenentes with the title of catholicos while David was still very young and before he himself acceded to the primacy of the Georgian church c. 1447.

The treaty permitted the island of Menorca to remain under Muslim rule, while remaining subject to the Aragonese king by means of the payment of a tribute. Having conquered Majorca, James I decided against an invasion of the neighbouring island because he needed the forces for the conquest of Valencia. Thus he resorted to a stratagem of dissuasion. He ordered huge bonfires, which could be seen from Menorca, to be lit in the town so that the Muslims who lived there would think that there was a great army ready to invade.

A disciple of Zen Master Jeongang, he received Dharma transmission from his teacher and thereby becoming the 78th patriarch in the Dharma Lineage of the Buddha in 1962. Activities Teaching activities After a period spent in isolation in 1988 he founded Moonzen and the Moonzen Zen Centers in order to widely spread the teaching he received from his master, Zen Master Jeongang. Zen Master Daewon educates and trains his disciples at Moonzen Zen Centers around the country. Interest in environment Faced with the many phenomena that accompany climate change, in 2009 Zen Master Daewon established the International Union to Prevent Desertification (IUPD). He is active in participating in the resolution of climate change. For example, through IUPD, Zen Master Daewon opened the measures to prevent the desertification at the UNCCD (United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification) and made an agreement with Burkina Faso and the Republic of Niger in order to stop the desertification. At present, after a successful test, the process to change barren desert into grass land is in steady process in the two countries. Dharma transmission Early life and background He is recognized as a disciple of Zen Master Jeongang, the 77th patriarch and Zen Master of the Jogye Order of Korean Buddhism. Zen Master Daewon received Dharma Transmission from Zen Master Jeongang. When Master Daewon was 12, his father died in front of his eyes, and this experience left an indelible imprint on the young man's view of the world. As soon as he was able to leave his house, in 1954 he entered into the large monastery, Hae-in-sa temple under the mentorship of his preceptor Master Pak In-gok. Searching for the true master Since he was motivated to understand about life and death he searched around the country for an enlightened master with whom he could practice with. After practicing for several years he finally was able to meet with the famous Zen Master Jeongang sunim. In 1962 while he was practicing at Dong-hwa-sa temple the following story has been left behind. Part of the dharma transmission story Prior to the summer monastic retreat, the abbot of the Dong-hwa-sa temple, Wolsan sunim had publicly announced that the Zen Master Jeongang would be overseeing the 3 month retreat so meditators from around the country gathered there to practice. One evening, during a session of sitting meditation, all of the seats in the meditation hall were empty except for those of a couple elder monks. The young Daewon thought this to be unusual and then saw a young monk furtively call him out, quietly waving at him from outside the hall. When he went to him, the young monk told Daewon sunim that a group of monks were waiting for him up on the mountain out back. Daewon sunim followed the young monk into the mountain and found a gathering of twenty monks, waiting for him in stony silence. Immediately upon seeing Daewon sunim, one of the monks named Beopseong (presently known as the Zen Master Jinje, a disciple of Zen Master Hyanggok), called out to him, \\"Say something about Bodhidharma's 'I don't know.' Kong-an (Koan).\\" Daewon sunim answered without a moment's hesitation, \\"Revealed.\\" Songam sunim, who was standing nearby asked him about the Ansujeongdeung Kong-an (Koan), \\"How would you save yourself?\\" Daewon sunim spoke loudly, \\"An (Â≤∏)! Su (Ê®π)! Jeong (‰∫ï)! Deung (Ëó§)!\\" All the gathered monks stood still with their lips pursed in silence as Daewon sunim turned around and walked away. The next day after breakfast, Myeongheo sunim, who was serving as monitor for the retreat, called a temple hearing to find out why the monks had been absent without notice the night before. During the hearing, all that had happened up on the mountain was laid out in the open and as a result, the monks who had been absent during the sitting meditation session assumed their formal robes and bowed in penance before Zen Master Jeongang, who was serving as the Josil of the temple at the time. Birth of the 78th patriarch The next day, Zen Master Jeongang called on Daewon sunim. He told Daewon that his first Song of Enlightenment was clear evidence of his enlightenment but that a Song of Enlightenment is customarily kept short. To this, Daewon sunim recited the second Song of Enlightenment he had composed when he saw the sun and the moon in the setting sky while passing the fields of Gimje. After Zen Master Jeongang heard the second Song of Enlightenment, he again asked Master Daewon to make up another song on the spot that would encapsulate the same stage of enlightenment. Immediately upon this request, Master Daewon produced the following song: :Over the rock the wind passes through the pine trees, :And below the mountain flies the golden oriole. :There is not a trace even of the entire universe, :But the monkey cries loudly under the moonlight. Zen Master Jeongang listened to the first two lines with his eyes gently closed; then upon hearing the last two lines, he opened his eyes, revealing delight. However, he did not stop there and asked once more, \\"When the others called you out on the mountain and Beopseong asked you to speak on the 'I don't know.' Kong-an (Koan), you said, 'Revealed.' If you were Emperor Wu of Liang, how wouldyou respond to Bodhidharma's 'I don't know.'?\\" \\"If I was Emperor Wu of Liang, I'd respond by saying 'Even though there is no such thing as a saint, wouldn't it be much better to enjoy the flowering of my virtue together, just like this?' and take him by the hand.\\" Zen Master Jeongang spoke with astonishment, \\"How have you reached such a stage?\\" \\"How could one say that he has reached it, that he has it, or that it is of his nature? It is only just like this.\\" In this manner, the reverend Daewon, received Dharma Transmission from the Master Jeongang and in 1962 became the 78th patriarch in the Korean tradition of Zen. Academic Lineage of Buddhist Doctrine (Lineage of Instruction) At his ordination ceremony in 2009, Zen Master Daewon was received into the Academic Lineages of Buddhist Doctrine by Zen Masters: Hoegwang Saseonbul (Êô¶ÂÖâ Â∏´Áíø‰Ωõ) and Yongseong Jinjong (ÈæçÂüé ÈúáÈçæ). Buddhist texts translation and publications Zen Master Daewon has translated and published collections of kong-ans, famous sutras, analects of Buddhist patriarchs and many profound Buddhist texts. Furthermore, he has reinterpreted these works with a modern viewpoint and added his own gathas and incisive comments. , Zen Master Daewon is translating 80 volumes of the Avatamsaka Sutra and is also preparing to publish more Buddhist texts.

The palace is situated in Murapara village, about 25 km southeast of Dhaka on the Narsindghi road. It is connected 5 km stretch of bumpy brick-paved feeder road on the west of main Dhaka- Sylhet trunk road.Husain A., ASIATIC SOCIETY VOLUME-2 ARCHITECTURE, PP.392 History \\"Murapara Rajbari\\" is one of the examples of such activity of an affluent community located in Murapara village, about 25 kilometres southeast of Dhaka on the western side of the Dhaka-Narsingdi road. The Murapara Jomidarbari/Palace was established by the founder of the Murapara Raj family named Ramratan Banerjee. He was appointed as treasurer of the Natore estate and rose to a high position and acquired large properties by dint of his honesty. One source says it was Ramratan Banarjee who constructed the palace in 1889 but the other source says he just established the basement of the structure. It was Protap Chandra Banarjee who left his old traditional house and made new palace behind the old one in 1889. Architecture The two- storey picturesque palace is rectangular in plan and has a grand frontage facing west of about 200 feet long. A 10 feet wide verandah runs in front of the palace at both levels, providing access to the rooms. The depth of the verandah is used as a shading device from the western sun. It has semicircular arches. The areas in the arches are filled with cast iron tracery decorated with green, red and blue glasses, so that the floor of the verandah demonstrates as a colourful mosaic pattern by casting shadow from the sun.

He was co-king with his father from 1433 to 1442 and with his brother Vakhtang IV from 1442 to 1446. On Vakhtang's death, Demetrius became a de jure king of Georgia but his accession to the throne was precluded by his younger brother George VIII. Biography Demetrius first appears in the charter dated to 1413. Traditional Georgian historiography founded by Prince Vakhushti in the 18th century erroneously makes him a younger brother of George VIII and frequently omits him from the list of the kings of Georgia. Demetrius was co-opted by his father Alexander I in 1433. He was sent by him as ambassador to Shah Rukh, Timur's son. After Alexander I's renouncement of the throne in 1442 in favor of Vakhtang IV, Demetrius remained a co-king with the latter, whereas Alexander's third son, George VIII, was made a co-king appanaged in Kakheti. Upon the death of Vakhtang IV in 1446, Demetrius III was to become de jure king-regnant of Georgia, but the throne was seized by George VIII, inaugurating a series of conflicts which would eventually lead to the dissolution of the kingdom of Georgia by the close of the 15th century. Demetrius retired to the western province of Imereti. He was killed by a horse while hunting in 1453. Family Demetrius was married, sometime after 1446, to Gulashar, whom Marie-F√©licit√© Brosset identified with his aunt Gulkan, the widow of Demetrius's paternal uncle George. She died in 1471 or c. 1475. Their son, Constantine II, was the last king of a united Georgia (1478‚Äì1490) and the first king of Kartli (1490‚Äì1505). The historian Vakhushti claims that Demetrius had another son, David, who was installed as king in Kakheti in 1465 by the local nobility and founded the dynasty of the kings of Kakheti. Vakhushti makes David the father of George, king of Kakheti, whom he differentiates from George VIII, Demetrius's younger brother, at first king of Georgia and then king of Kakheti. The David of Vakhushti is, however, a fictitious figure.

It was built during the Bengal Sultanate under the reign of Sultan Alauddin Hussain Shah.https://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/2019/12/22/goaldi-mosque-in- sonargaon It is one of the few surviving medieval monuments in Sonargaon Upazila, Bangladesh. History The mosque was established in 1519. It was built by Mulla Hizabar Akbar Khan during the reign of Sultan Alauddin Husain Shah of Bengal at a place called Goaldi - half a mile northeast of Panam village in Sonargaon. Sonargaon was a Mint Town of the Bengal Sultanate and often served as a royal capital. The Sultans often launched raids into Assam, Tripura and Arakan from Sonargaon.https://www.dhakatribune.com/feature/2019/12/22/goaldi-mosque-in- sonargaon The town was the principal administrative center of eastern Bengal, particularly the Bhati region. The area falls under present-day Narayanganj District, Bangladesh. The mosque is of the more elegant and ornate sultanate- era mosques in the country. Architectural features Mihrabs inside Goaldi Mosque The Goaldi mosque is a good example of the 'enclosed square type' mosque of Bengal that is distinguished by a cubical prayer chamber with corner towers and entrances on all sides except the qibla wall. A single dome caps the mosque; engaged ribbed turrets define the four corners; and the cornice is gently sloped. Circular corner towers are a deviation from the usual octagonal corner towers. This is the only example of circular corner towers in the Dhaka district. Accentuating the cornice is a row of small niches with floral motifs inside. The east facade has three arched openings, embellished on either sides with rectangular panels of delicate relief work in the form of a niche with an ornamental hanging lamp motif. The north and south facades similarly display three arches, though only the center arch is open while the two side arches are blind. The cubical prayer chamber measures 7.57 m and the walls are 2 m thick. The dome is carried on squinches that spring from the tops of stone pilasters, two on each wall. The qibla wall has three mihrabs. The use of black basalt for the central mihrab was a common practice during the sixteenth century. It is decorated with beautiful, intricate patterns composed of an ornamental hanging lamp motif. The two flanking mihrabs are decorated in similar fashion but instead of black basalt they are made of brick and fine terra cotta work. Lotus motifs are found carved in the spandrels and are closely related to the lotuses held by the Hindu god, Surya. Present condition The condition of mosque had deteriorated: with the exception of the qibla wall the entire mosque had collapsed, including the dome. Careful restoration was executed by the Department of Archaeology and Museums and this small graceful mosque is now restored to resemble its original design. References * Ahmed, Nazimuddin. 1984.

Foundation Ocean Recovery Alliance was founded by Douglas Woodring and Ashley Day in 2010. Doug, currently Managing Director of Ocean Recovery Alliance, also co-founded Project Kaisei in 2009, which led a science expedition to the North Pacific Gyre with Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) listed plastic pollution in the ocean as the first of three main focal points in their 2011 UNEP Yearbook, indicating the necessity of addressing how we use and dispose of plastics. One of the causes of plastic pollution is that so many of our disposable, single-use products, are made with a permanent material - plastic. With the growth of our \\"disposable\\" lifestyles has come a growing burden on communities and governments whose waste management and recycling infrastructures have not been able to keep pace with our consumption patterns and waste generation. Ocean Recovery Alliance is working on ways to combat this issue through the following projects: Projects The group is an umbrella organization which operates and organizes a variety of sub-projects related to the reduction of plastic pollution, ocean conservation, and general awareness about the value of our waters. Two of the projects within the group were announced at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) in 2010, and are focused on innovative prevention programs for plastic waste reduction. This includes the Plastic Disclosure Project, and the Global Alert platform. Ocean Recovery Alliance is also a founding member of the Ocean Conservancy‚Äôs ‚ÄúTrash Free Seas Alliance‚Äù which was announced at the Clinton Global Initiative in 2011. On June 21, 2012, Ocean Recovery Alliance hosted a side event Plasticity Forum Rio, at the RIO+20 Earth Summit. The Tsunami Debris Tracking Project was the first project to place satellite tracking buoys to follow some of the debris flow in the south west part of the plume that was generated from the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Together with Wallem Group and Anglo Eastern, Ocean Recovery Alliance installed acoustic equipment to bring awareness and enhanced science observations for the endangered Chinese white dolphin. Ocean Recovery Alliance, in association with Flynn Consulting, published a bilingual book titled Water Margin: Hong Kong's Link to the Sea. This book, which features images and stories from Hong Kong's unique aquatic environment, will be distributed free to over 700 local schools in Hong Kong. In April 2012, Ocean Recovery Alliance organized Asia's first ocean film festival, in association with the San Francisco Ocean Film Festival HK-SF Ocean Film Festival. In September 2012, Ocean Recovery Alliance organized Kids Ocean Day HK. To celebrate World Oceans Day each June 8, Ocean Recovery Alliance encourages the Oceanic Big 5 to organize ocean cleanups to give back to the environment they rely on for recreation. The Oceanic Big 5 are the top sport users of our ocean; surfers, sailors, swimmers, divers and paddlers. Ocean Recovery Alliance offers educational Junk Trips for companies or schools. Groups will have hands-on experience trawling for plastic debris on the west side of Hong Kong and learn about what plastic pollution means to Hong Kong and what we can do to make a difference. In response to an unusual inundation of marine trash in 2016, ORA organized a human art piece and protest \\"Trashzilla\\" in November 2016. Grate Art project: As part of an educational awareness campaign about the link between drains and the ocean, artistic ceramic tiles with environmental messages have been installed near sewage grates.

Similar to the Carbon Disclosure Project, PDP encourages measurement, disclosure and management to improve corporate, community and individual accountability on plastic manufacture, use and disposal. Foundation PDP was announced at the opening plenary session of the Clinton Global Initiative in 2010 as a preventative project that can help address the issue of plastic waste on a global scale. PDP is a project of Ocean Recovery Alliance. Goals * Create a world where plastic can be used, but where there is no environmental impact as a result * Use annual reporting and measurement of production or waste creation to bring about better management * Encourage sustainable business practices around plastic use * Inspire improved design and innovative solutions for plastic products and packaging How it works PDP asks businesses to measure, manage, reduce and benefit from plastic waste to create a world where plastic benefits consumers and businesses without negatively impacting the environment. PDP is based on the principle that to effectively manage and improve efficiency in plastic use, reuse and recycling, businesses must first quantify their plastics. Annual disclosure requests are sent to companies that use plastic for goods and/or services on behalf of socially conscious investors and community stakeholders. PDP aims to connect solution providers with prospective companies to facilitate design and innovation. All types of organisation are invited to participate in PDP and commit to reducing their plastic footprint. Company disclosures Lush (company) became the first PDP Discloser in 2011. In 2012 UC Berkeley became the first university to join PDP. The project will be managed by Campus Recycling and Refuse Services as well as the Office of Sustainability, and the university plans to assign interns to track plastic waste as it leaves campus. Further companies in at least a dozen countries have expressed interest in this project. At the Plasticity Forum Rio '12, an alliance was formed between Plastic Pollution Coalition and PDP to work with university campuses around the world to reduce their plastic footprint. Earth People,http://www.earthpeopleco.com/ a Dallas-based environmental consultancy, is the first consultancy to offer plastic assessment and reporting services though PDP for clients.

Nearly all daylight fish have color vision that is at least as good as a human's (see vision in fishes). Many fish also have chemoreceptors that are responsible for extraordinary senses of taste and smell. Although they have ears, many fish may not hear very well. Most fish have sensitive receptors that form the lateral line system, which detects gentle currents and vibrations, and senses the motion of nearby fish and prey. Sharks can sense frequencies in the range of 25 to 50 Hz through their lateral line. Fish orient themselves using landmarks and may use mental maps based on multiple landmarks or symbols. Fish behavior in mazes reveals that they possess spatial memory and visual discrimination.  Vision  Diagrammatic vertical section through the eye of teleost fish. Fish have a refractive index gradient within the lens which compensates for spherical aberration. Unlike humans, most fish adjust focus by moving the lens closer or further from the retina.Helfman et al, 2009, pp. 84-87. Teleosts do so by contracting the retractor lentis muscle. Vision is an important sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes are similar to those of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rod cells and cone cells (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots.N. A. Campbell and J. B. Reece (2005). Biology, Seventh Edition. Benjamin Cummings, San Francisco, California. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment. Fish and other aquatic animals live in a different light environment than terrestrial species. Water absorbs light so that with increasing depth the amount of light available decreases quickly. The optic properties of water also lead to different wavelengths of light being absorbed to different degrees, for example light of long wavelengths (e.g. red, orange) is absorbed quite quickly compared to light of short wavelengths (blue, violet), though ultraviolet light (even shorter wavelength than blue) is absorbed quite quickly as well. Besides these universal qualities of water, different bodies of water may absorb light of different wavelengths because of salts and other chemicals in the water.  Hearing  Hearing is an important sensory system for most species of fish. Hearing threshold and the ability to localize sound sources are reduced underwater, in which the speed of sound is faster than in air. Underwater hearing is by bone conduction, and localization of sound appears to depend on differences in amplitude detected by bone conduction. As such, aquatic animals such as fish have a more specialized hearing apparatus that is effective underwater. Fish can sense sound through their lateral lines and their otoliths (ears). Some fishes, such as some species of carp and herring, hear through their swim bladders, which function rather like a hearing aid.B, WILLIAMS C. \\"Sense of Hearing in Fishes.\\" Nature 147.3731 (n.d.): 543. Print. Hearing is well-developed in carp, which have the Weberian organ, three specialized vertebral processes that transfer vibrations in the swim bladder to the inner ear. Although it is hard to test sharks' hearing, they may have a sharp sense of hearing and can possibly hear prey many miles away. A small opening on each side of their heads (not the spiracle) leads directly into the inner ear through a thin channel. The lateral line shows a similar arrangement, and is open to the environment via a series of openings called lateral line pores. This is a reminder of the common origin of these two vibration- and sound-detecting organs that are grouped together as the acoustico-lateralis system. In bony fish and tetrapods the external opening into the inner ear has been lost. Current detection three-spined stickleback with stained neuromasts The lateral line in fish and aquatic forms of amphibians is a detection system of water currents, consisting mostly of vortices. The lateral line is also sensitive to low- frequency vibrations. It is used primarily for navigation, hunting, and schooling. The mechanoreceptors are hair cells, the same mechanoreceptors for vestibular sense and hearing. Hair cells in fish are used to detect water movements around their bodies. These hair cells are embedded in a jelly-like protrusion called cupula. The hair cells therefore can not be seen and do not appear on the surface of skin. The receptors of the electrical sense are modified hair cells of the lateral line system. Fish and some aquatic amphibians detect hydrodynamic stimuli via a lateral line. This system consists of an array of sensors called neuromasts along the length of the fish's body.Bleckmann, H, and R Zelick. \\"Lateral line system of fish.\\" Integrative Zoology 4 (2009): 13-25. . Neuromasts can be free-standing (superficial neuromasts) or within fluid-filled canals (canal neuromasts). The sensory cells within neuromasts are polarized hair cells contained within a gelatinous cupula.Herring, Peter. The Biology of the Deep Ocean. New York: Oxford, 2002. The cupula, and the stereocilia which are the \\"hairs\\" of hair cells, are moved by a certain amount depending on the movement of the surrounding water. Afferent nerve fibers are excited or inhibited depending on whether the hair cells they arise from are deflected in the preferred or opposite direction. Lateral line neurons form somatotopic maps within the brain informing the fish of amplitude and direction of flow at different points along the body. These maps are located in the medial octavolateral nucleus (MON) of the medulla and in higher areas such as the torus semicircularis. Pressure detection Pressure detection uses the organ of Weber, a system consisting of three appendages of vertebrae transferring changes in shape of the gas bladder to the middle ear. It can be used to regulate the buoyancy of the fish. Fish like the weather fish and other loaches are also known to respond to low pressure areas but they lack a swim bladder. Chemoreception(smelling) The shape of the alt=Eyelevel photo of hammerhead from the front The aquatic equivalent to smelling in air is tasting in water. Many larger catfish have chemoreceptors across their entire bodies, which means they \\"taste\\" anything they touch and \\"smell\\" any chemicals in the water. \\"In catfish, gustation plays a primary role in the orientation and location of food\\".Atema, Jelle (1980) \\"Chemical senses, chemical signals, and feeding behavior in fishes\\" pp. 57‚Äì101. In: Bardach, JE Fish behavior and its use in the capture and culture of fishes', The WorldFish Center, . Salmon have a strong sense of smell. Speculation about whether odours provide homing cues, go back to the 19th century.Trevanius 1822 In 1951, Hasler hypothesised that, once in vicinity of the estuary or entrance to its birth river, salmon may use chemical cues which they can smell, and which are unique to their natal stream, as a mechanism to home onto the entrance of the stream.Hasler 1951 In 1978, Hasler and his students convincingly showed that the way salmon locate their home rivers with such precision was indeed because they could recognise its characteristic smell. They further demonstrated that the smell of their river becomes imprinted in salmon when they transform into smolts, just before they migrate out to sea.Hasler 1978Dittman 1996 Homecoming salmon can also recognise characteristic smells in tributary streams as they move up the main river. They may also be sensitive to characteristic pheromones given off by juvenile conspecifics. There is evidence that they can \\"discriminate between two populations of their own species\\".Groot 1986 Sharks have keen olfactory senses, located in the short duct (which is not fused, unlike bony fish) between the anterior and posterior nasal openings, with some species able to detect as little as one part per million of blood in seawater. Sharks have the ability to determine the direction of a given scent based on the timing of scent detection in each nostril.The Function of Bilateral Odor Arrival Time Differences in Olfactory Orientation of Sharks , Jayne M. Gardiner, Jelle Atema, Current Biology - 13 July 2010 (Vol. 20, Issue 13, pp. 1187-1191) This is similar to the method mammals use to determine the direction of sound. They are more attracted to the chemicals found in the intestines of many species, and as a result often linger near or in sewage outfalls. Some species, such as nurse sharks, have external barbels that greatly increase their ability to sense prey. The MHC genes are a group of genes present in many animals and important for the immune system; in general, offspring from parents with differing MHC genes have a stronger immune system. Fish are able to smell some aspect of the MHC genes of potential sex partners and prefer partners with MHC genes different from their own. Electroreception and magnetoreception alt=Drawing of shark head. Active electrolocation. Conductive objects concentrate the field and resistive objects spread the field. Electroreception, or electroception, is the ability to detect electric fields or currents. Some fish, such as catfish and sharks, have organs that detect weak electric potentials on the order of millivolts.Albert, J.S., and W.G.R. Crampton. 2005. Electroreception and electrogenesis. pp. 431‚Äì472 in The Physiology of Fishes, 3rd Edition. D.H. Evans and J.B. Claiborne (eds.). CRC Press. Other fish, like the South American electric fishes Gymnotiformes, can produce weak electric currents, which they use in navigation and social communication. In sharks, the ampullae of Lorenzini are electroreceptor organs. They number in the hundreds to thousands. Sharks use the ampullae of Lorenzini to detect the electromagnetic fields that all living things produce. This helps sharks (particularly the hammerhead shark) find prey. The shark has the greatest electrical sensitivity of any animal. Sharks find prey hidden in sand by detecting the electric fields they produce. Ocean currents moving in the magnetic field of the Earth also generate electric fields that sharks can use for orientation and possibly navigation. Electric field proximity sensing is used by the electric catfish to navigate through muddy waters. These fish make use of spectral changes and amplitude modulation to determine factors such shape, size, distance, velocity, and conductivity. The abilities of the electric fish to communicate and identify sex, age, and hierarchy within the species are also made possible through electric fields. EF gradients as low as 5nV/cm can be found in some saltwater weakly electric fish.Zimmerman, T., Smith, J., Paradiso, J., Allport, D., & Gershenfeld, N. (1995). Applying Electric Field Sensing to Human-Computer Interfaces. IEEE SIG . The paddlefish (Polyodon spathula) hunts plankton using thousands of tiny passive electroreceptors located on its extended snout, or rostrum. The paddlefish is able to detect electric fields that oscillate at 0.5‚Äì20 Hz, and large groups of plankton generate this type of signal. See: Electroreceptors in paddlefish Electric fishes use an active sensory system to probe the environment and create active electrodynamic imaging.Montgomery JC, Coombs S, Baker CF (2001) The mechanosensory lateral line system of the hypogean form of Astyanax fasciatus. Env Biol Fish 62:87‚Äì96 In 1973, it was shown that Atlantic salmon have conditioned cardiac responses to electric fields with strengths similar to those found in oceans. \\"This sensitivity might allow a migrating fish to align itself upstream or downstream in an ocean current in the absence of fixed references.\\"Rommel 1973 Magnetoception, or magnetoreception, is the ability to detect the direction one is facing based on the Earth's magnetic field. In 1988, researchers found iron, in the form of single domain magnetite, resides in the skulls of sockeye salmon. The quantities present are sufficient for magnetoception.Quinn 1988 Fish navigation Salmon regularly migrate thousands of miles to and from their breeding grounds. Salmon spend their early life in rivers, and then swim out to sea where they live their adult lives and gain most of their body mass. After several years wandering huge distances in the ocean where they mature, most surviving salmons return to the same natal rivers to spawn. Usually they return with uncanny precision to the river where they were born: most of them swim up the rivers until they reach the very spawning ground that was their original birthplace.Moyle 2004, p.190 There are various theories about how this happens. One theory is that there are geomagnetic and chemical cues which the salmon use to guide them back to their birthplace. It is thought that, when they are in the ocean, they use magnetoception related to Earth's magnetic field to orient itself in the ocean and locate the general position of their natal river, and once close to the river, that they use their sense of smell to home in on the river entrance and even their natal spawning ground.Lohmann 2008  Pain  Hooked sailfish Experiments done by William Tavolga provide evidence that fish have pain and fear responses. For instance, in Tavolga's experiments, toadfish grunted when electrically shocked and over time they came to grunt at the mere sight of an electrode.Dunayer, Joan, \\"Fish: Sensitivity Beyond the Captor's Grasp,\\" The Animals' Agenda, July/August 1991, pp. 12‚Äì18 In 2003, Scottish scientists at the University of Edinburgh and the Roslin Institute concluded that rainbow trout exhibit behaviors often associated with pain in other animals. Bee venom and acetic acid injected into the lips resulted in fish rocking their bodies and rubbing their lips along the sides and floors of their tanks, which the researchers concluded were attempts to relieve pain, similar to what mammals would do.Vantressa Brown, \\"Fish Feel Pain, British Researchers Say,\\" Agence France-Presse, 1 May 2003 Neurons fired in a pattern resembling human neuronal patterns. Professor James D. Rose of the University of Wyoming claimed the study was flawed since it did not provide proof that fish possess \\"conscious awareness, particularly a kind of awareness that is meaningfully like ours\\". Rose argues that since fish brains are so different from human brains, fish are probably not conscious in the manner humans are, so that reactions similar to human reactions to pain instead have other causes. Rose had published a study a year earlier arguing that fish cannot feel pain because their brains lack a neocortex.James D. Rose, Do Fish Feel Pain?, 2002. Retrieved 27 September 2007. However, animal behaviorist Temple Grandin argues that fish could still have consciousness without a neocortex because \\"different species can use different brain structures and systems to handle the same functions.\\" Animal welfare advocates raise concerns about the possible suffering of fish caused by angling. Some countries, such as Germany have banned specific types of fishing, and the British RSPCA now prosecutes individuals who are cruel to fish.

She released the song under Republic Records (at the time, Universal Republic Records) on December 12, 2011. The song samples \\"What's Up?\\" (1993) by 4 Non Blondes. Background Grande began working on her debut album while she was filming Victorious and formally started to work on it with a record label after she was signed to Universal Republic Records on August 10, 2011. By September 10 of that year, Grande already had twenty songs prepared and was going through the process of narrowing it down to thirteen. \\"Put Your Hearts Up\\" was written by Matt Squire, Linda Perry, and Martin Johnson. It was released the first single on December 12, 2011. It's a \\"50s, 60s doo-wop- inspired\\" bubblegum pop song which talks about making the world a better place. Release and cover Grande decided to let her fans be a part of choosing the single's artwork by showing four possible covers for the single via her account on Twitter. After the fans voted, the cover was chosen and the release date for the single was announced via Ariana Grande's Twitter account on November 29, 2011. \\"Put Your Hearts Up\\" was originally going to be released on December 20, 2011, but was later decided to be released earlier. \\"Put Your Hearts Up\\" premiered on On Air with Ryan Seacrest on December 9, 2011 and became available for digital download through iTunes three days later.

Clark. Goines released the books under a pseudonym on the request of his publisher, who wanted to avoid flooding the market with too many books under Goines's name and potentially undermining sales as well as to differentiate the books from Goines's \\"grittier\\" urban fiction novels. The books cover the actions of a man by the name of Kenyatta, named after Jomo Kenyatta, that leads a group of militant blacks similar to the Black Panther Party. The series comprises four books, Crime Partners, Death List, Kenyatta's Escape, and Kenyatta's Last Hit. Goines released the first book in June 1974 through Holloway House, with the final book being published posthumously in November of the same year. Synopsis Crime Partners Crime Partners introduces the character of Kenyatta, the leader of a group of militant Blacks. The novel also introduces the reader to a pair of detectives named Benson and Ryan, who are intent on tracking down the people responsible for the murders going on in the city. The story takes place in Detroit, where two stick-up men named Jackie and Billy break into the apartment of a drug addicted couple. They discover the body of a child that had been beaten to death, which enrage them. Jackie and Billy then decide to kill the couple in addition to robbing them due to their part in the child's death. After they finish this, they end up coming across a man named Kenyatta, who runs a group of militant Blacks intent on ridding the streets of drug dealers and racist cops. He manages to persuade the two into joining the group in order to kill a couple of racist cops as well as to hire them to perform a hit on a local drug dealer. Jackie and Billy stake out the drug dealer for a few days before killing him, unaware that their surveillance has been observed by a drug addict. The drug addict then goes to the police to report the crime with the intention of gaining the identity of the two men he had observed and selling it to the drug dealer's supplier. During this time Jackie and Billy have traveled to a farm where Kenyatta trains the organization's members. While they are there the two fall in love with some of the girls working from within the organization. Billy, Jackie, and the two girls they meet later travel back to Detroit, but are ambushed and killed. Death List Death List picks up immediately after the events in Crime Partners, with detectives Benson and Ryan discovering the bodies of Jackie, Billy, and their girlfriends. Meanwhile, Kenyatta has agreed to pay an arms dealer for a list of the city's drug suppliers, but must hold up a food stamp depot in order to pay him. Once he has the list, Kenyatta has one of his men knock off the people on the list one by one. This proves to be a relatively effective task with the exception of the man at the top of the list, who is elusive. He eventually manages to locate the man by way of a person that works in the supplier's apartment and has that person commit the hit. During all of this Benson and Ryan continue to investigate Kenyatta, eventually locating the farm he trains his members at. The book ends with Kenyatta and a few of his men hijacking an airplane while the police head towards the farm where most of the organization is currently located. Kenyatta's Escape The novel follows Kenyatta as he and part of his organization hijack a plane while the rest of his group are assaulted by the police and military at a farm. Much of the group at the farm are killed despite some surrendering, with only four people managing to survive and escape. The survivors make their way to an apartment in Chicago. Meanwhile, Kenyatta and his small group depart from Detroit, only to become involved in a mid-flight gun battle. As a result of the gun fight one of the pilots is shot, while the other one had already been killed. Despite being shot, the pilot manages to land the plane in the Nevada desert, where Kenyatta and his group appropriate some motorcycles from a nearby group of bikers. This leads to a fight, with some of the bikers getting killed. Kenyatta's group then steal a few cars and drive out to Los Angeles, where the FBI has brought in Detroit detectives Benson and Ryan, who had been following Kenyatta. The novel ends with a standoff at a gas station that sees Kenyatta‚Äôs group dwindle even further as a large explosion takes out some police officers as well as a few of Kenyatta's people. Kenyatta and the surviving members of his group manage to escape the explosion and the incoming police officers just in time to avoid both death and capture. Kenyatta's Last Hit The final book in the series, Kenyatta's Last Hit takes place in Los Angeles a year after the events in the previous entry. Kenyatta has managed to form a new group of activists that share his goals to clean the streets of drug dealers and crooked cops. He has also managed to recruit Elliot Stone, a former college football player, to join him. Stone is later shot by a gang along with two of Kenyatta's men, with the gang also setting fire to the building that Stone is in. He manages to escape dying in the fire, but is taken to a hospital where Kenyatta's men are forced to rescue him. They take him to Kenyatta's hide out, where he quickly recovers. The Detroit detectives Benson and Ryan fly into Los Angeles after discovering that the two dead men are members of Kenyatta's group, but are paired with a crooked LA cop. This cop does whatever he can to undermine the investigation, killing several witnesses before being killed himself. Kenyatta later sets up a meeting with a major drug dealer, then kills the drug dealer's men and threatens to kill him unless he introduces Kenyatta to his supplier. The drug dealer sets up a meeting in Las Vegas, only for it to turn into a bloodbath. Despite Kenyatta's attempts, the supplier escapes via helicopter while Kenyatta and much of his militant group and shot and killed. The bodies are then dumped, with Benson and Ryan being called in to identify Kenyatta's corpse. Themes The Kenyatta series deals with several themes such as drug usage and the idea of morality. The book also dealt with the idea of the exploitation of Black sex trade workers by white financiers as well as with the idea of African and African-American \\"cultural and political nationalism behind bars\\". In addition to Kenyatta seeking revenge against white police officers and financiers that he believes have wronged his people, the books also deal with the theme of black on black crime and the possible futility of one man attempting to clean up the ghettos in the absence of state or local government assistance. In his book Low Road: The Life and Legacy of Donald Goines, Eddie B. Allen, Jr described the series as \\"symbolizing [Goines's] desire for victory\\" and \\"represented the strength and fearless determination that he lacked\\". Allen expressed disappointment over Kenyatta's death, as he saw the character as a representation of Goines's \\"desire to overcome his addiction to drugs\\" and because it \\"suggests that good can never defeat the larger societal evils that afflict our black communities.\\" Film adaptation Film rights to the Kenyatta series were purchased by Picture Perfect Films, with Kenneth McGriff intending to release all four books as a series of feature-length films. The first film, Crime Partners was released in 2003. The film starred Ice-T, Snoop Dogg, and Ja Rule, with Clifton Powell playing the character of Kenyatta. The film was directed by J. Jesses Smith, with McGriff producing. Producer Irv Gotti funded and marketed Crime Partner's soundtrack, with part of the funding being seized by the Federal government. Federal agents claimed that the soundtrack was one of several avenues used by Murder Inc. and Gotti to launder drug money.

Moscow: Likominvest.) was a Georgian nobleman active during and in the aftermath of Timur's invasions of Georgia. He was a father-in-law of King Constantine I of Georgia and a maternal grandfather of King Alexander I of Georgia.Toumanoff, Cyril (1949‚Äì51). \\"The Fifteenth-Century Bagratids and the Institution of Collegial Sovereignty in Georgia\\". Traditio 7: 176‚Äì177. Origin It is not completely clear to which noble house Kutsna belonged. The latter part of his name, Amirejibi, or sometimes written as Amiredjibi, indicates his being a Prince-Chamberlain of the Kingdom of Georgia, but it is also the surname of the aristocratic family better documented from the early 17th century. Modern genealogists in Georgia have accepted the notion that Kutsna was one of the earliest members of that family as plausible. In the view of the historian Cyril Toumanoff, the praenomen of Kutsna as well as that of his grandfather Kurtsik may suggest that he belonged to the feudal house of Khurtsikidze or Khurtsidze from Samtskhe, but, on the other hand the family memory believes and certain historical documents, such as The King George the Excellent's \\"Khelmtsifis karis garigeba\\", dated close to 1340-46, suggests that the family surname of Amirejibi is Kvabulidze, or Kobulisdze, in later centuries pronounced as Gabelidze, or even Gobelidze. The first documented appearance of this noble family dates back to 819 A.D. In his charter, Kutsna mentions his homonymous ancestor as having been a constable of Georgia under Queen Regnant Rusudan (r. 1223‚Äì1245). But between the constableship of Zakaria II Mkhargrdzeli (who died in 1212) and that of his nephew Avag-Sargis III Mkhargrdzeli (who filled that office from 1233/4 to 1250), the incumbents of it are not known. Career and family Kutsna was married to the lady called Rusa Mkheidze (Rusudan; died 1413). Their daughter, Natia, became the consort of King Constantine I of Georgia and mothered Alexander I, at the time of whose birth c. 1390 Kutsna was ambassador to Constantinople. The chronicles describe him as the one who was \\"greatly ennobled by the kings\\" and who \\"headed the army\\". Both Kutsna and his wife Rusa are known for their restoration of churches and monasteries in the aftermath of Timur's devastations; Kutsna patronized the churches of Ulumba and Nabakhtevi, and Rusa undertook the restoration of the principal cathedral of the Living Pillar at Mtskheta. She also directed the education of Alexander I and influenced the future king's preoccupations and his enthusiasm for religious building.Salia, Kalistrat (1983). History of the Georgian nation, p. 242. Paris: N. Salia.Rayfield, Donald (2012). Edge of Empires: A History of Georgia, p. 153. London: Reaktion Books. . Kutsna appears in the contemporary records for the last time in 1415. He was succeeded by his son Ramin as the head of the family. Kutsna's fresco portrait as well as those of his wife and four children survive in the Nabakhtevi church, in Shida Kartli, east of Surami.

It is sponsored by the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society. History In 1976, the International Wittgenstein Symposium was founded by Elisabeth Leinfellner, Werner Leinfellner, Rudolf Haller, Paul Weingartner, and Adolf H√ºbner in Kirchberg am Wechsel, Lower Austria. The location was chosen because in the 1920s, Ludwig Wittgenstein taught at elementary schools in the area surrounding Kirchberg am Wechsel. On the 24th to the 25th of April, 1976 (just prior to the 25th anniversary of Wittgenstein's death), the first conference took place. Only four of the five founders gave talks on his philosophical work at the first meeting, but at the second, 120 speakers attended from around the world. Philosophical topics The general topic of each symposium centers around the philosophy and philosophy of science of Wittgenstein, but the specific topics change from year to year. For example, the topic of the second International Wittgenstein Symposium was \\"Wittgenstein and his impact on contemporary thought\\" and the topic of the third symposium was \\"Wittgenstein, the Vienna Circle, and critical rationalism (including a seminar on Popper's open society).\\" A survey of topics is available from the site of the Austrian Ludwig Wittgenstein Society. Proceedings Starting with the second symposium, the papers accepted for presentation have been published in edited proceedings. From 1978 to 2005 the proceedings of the International Wittgenstein Symposium were published by H√∂lder-Pichler-Tempsky and are now published by ontos verlag. The proceedings published at ontos verlag are available Open Access online at a site prepared by the Wittgenstein Archives at the University of Bergen. The Wittgenstein Archives have also prepared a site that contains an Open Access selection of symposium papers from the period 2001-10.

The Age. 25 April 1961 p.2 The Age book reviewer Richard Troy described Strizic's contribution; \\"The photography is startlingly imaginative and startlingly beautiful‚Äîbeautiful, not in the sense of the word as movie-advertisement copy writers use it, but in the sense that truth is beautiful\\".Richard Troy, 'Portrait of a city: a Melbourne camera study,' The Age Saturday, Feb 4, 1961, p.19  Fine art  Having exhibited there with Athol Shmith in 1958, Strizic become the first photographer to exhibit solo at the National Gallery of Victoria in 1968Mark Strizic: A Journey in Photography information National Portrait Gallery Travelling Exhibitions site http://www.portrait.gov.au/site/exhibition_subsite_strizic4.php and the first whose work was acquired by the National Gallery of Australia. In 1984 he became a full-time artist, photographer and designer and the winner of a number of photographic awards and grants and finding a market for large scale mural installations amongst corporate clients. He began combining, enlarging, cropping and transforming elements from his black and white negatives through montage, then colourising and posterising the monochrome images in the manner associated with Pop Art. Symbols of urban ugliness such as power poles and billboards were his subject matter and critical target in often apocalyptic imagery intended to provoke a social consciousness.\\"The essential ugliness has been glossed with beauty; and this is because Strizic's eye is instinctively selective. From an infinite range of possible shots it selects the ones in which the truth is armatured on a structure of formal beauty. His photographs are about ugliness. but as photographs they are not ugly. Strizic constructs vast and colourful murals [...] that are to be read as decorative abstracts. It comes as something of a shock to realise that these apparently non- figurative schemes are often evolved from a single figurative motif.\\". Review by James Gleeson, Sydney Morning Herald , 1 July 1973. He was an early adopter of digital imaging techniques in producing such murals.Strizic discussed these processes in an address to \\"Still Photography?\\", \\"International Symposium on digital imaging, Melbourne, April 4, to April 8, 1994\\".

The Strizic portraits were shown that year at the National Gallery of Victoria in a solo exhibition that was reviewed dismissively as 'posed' and 'self-conscious', by Melbourne Age painting critic Patrick McCaughey. In his 1969 review of the book, writer Clive Turnbull enthused over the 'complementarity' of the portraits of the same people in the two different media.\\"The idea of printing reproductions of paintings and photographs of the subject matter in juxtaposition is not new; usually (as in the case of Cezanne) it is done to show how the artist has manipulated nature. Here Strizic‚Äôs portraits appear in their right as products of a different discipline and everyone is apparently happy about their complementarity. Both painter and photographer are very articulate and they tell us about their reactions to the sitters; where one knows the subjects oneself one can say that their comments are extremely discerning ‚Äì as one would expect.\\" Clive Turnbull, 'A sumptuous Taj Mahal of a book,' The Age Saturday 08 Feb 1969, p.15 Strizic used 35mm at a time when medium or large format was the norm for portraiture, and his use of long focal lengths, available light and aura- enhancing shallow depth of field sets the sitter into their environment.

The first production by Star Film, it was produced by Jo Eng Sek and features camerawork by Cho' Chin Hsin. Starring Pah Wongso, Elly Joenara and Mohamad Arief, it follows the social worker Pah Wongso as he investigates a murder to clear his prot√©g√©'s name. The first film of its genre to be produced in the Indies, Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman was made to capitalize on the popularity of Wijnhamer and Hollywood characters such as Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto. Released in April 1941 to popular acclaim, it had a mixed critical reception; the reviewer Saeroen suggested that its success was entirely because of its star's renown. A sequel to this film, Pah Wongso Tersangka, was released later in 1941 but is possibly lost. Plot Pah Wongso is a nut seller, social worker, and schoolmaster who lives in Batavia and takes care of the local poor. One day his young prot√©g√© Wisnoe saves the life of a young woman named Siti when she is almost hit by a carriage. Thankful, her father Haji Abdullah gives Wisnoe a job at his rice mill. Wisnoe's zeal and diligence quickly makes him stand out from his fellow employees and he begins to woo Siti, who returns his affections. However, Wisnoe's cousin Bardja is envious of his newfound success. A gambler who frequents prostitutes, Bardja is smitten with Siti, who does not love him. Hoping to eliminate his competition, Bardja hires some thugs to kill Wisnoe; this attempt fails, and Bardja's financial situation becomes increasingly desperate. He decides to steal from his rich uncle but is caught in the act. In the ensuing struggle, he kills the older man, then frames Wisnoe for the murder. Wisnoe is arrested, and soon Pah Wongso ‚Äì warned by Siti of Bardja's previous treachery ‚Äì begins to investigate the case. Ultimately he discovers that Bardja is the true murderer and confronts him, resulting in a battle to the death. Wongso emerges victorious, and Wisnoe's name is cleared. Production Pah Wongso teaching, in a scene from the film Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman was produced by Jo Eng Sek, a businessman who had produced the film Si Tjonat in 1929. Cinematography on this black-and-white film was handled by Cho' Chin Hsin, who had recently immigrated from Shanghai.; The film was the first production of Star Film, a studio which Jo and Cho' had established in Prinsenland, Batavia (now Mangga Besar, Jakarta). At the time, the Hollywood characters Charlie Chan and Mr. Moto were popular in the Indies, as were imported detective films in general; however, no films in that genre had yet been produced domestically. This led Jo to make a detective film which he thought would be successful with ethnic Chinese audiences. For this, he approached L. V. Wijnhamer, Jr., an Indo man who was popular within the ethnic Chinese community for his social work; Wijnhamer, better known as Pah Wongso, helped educate abandoned children, ran an employment office, and raised funds for Red Cross aid in war-torn China. Wijnhamer accepted the role. To support Wongso, stage actress Elly Joenara was cast as Siti, making her film debut, while Mohamad Arief appeared as Wisnu.; Other cast members included Djoenaedi, R. Sukran, and Miss Satijem. To ensure that fight scenes went smoothly, Jo hired members of Primo Oesman's silat and boxing group to perform as criminals; Oesman, a professional boxer, also appeared in the film. Release and reception Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman was rated for audiences over the age of 17. It premiered at the Rex Theatre in Batavia on 1 April 1941, following a short speech by Wijnhamer. It had reached Surabaya by June, where it was advertised as a film of intrigue, life, and death. Although intended predominantly for domestic consumption, it was also screened in China, Singapore and British Malaya. When the film reached Singapore in July 1941, it was touted as a \\"thrilling Malay detective story ... full of thrills and excitement from beginning to end\\". The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran records Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman as a commercial success. Critical reviews, however, were mixed. An anonymous reviewer in the Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad praised the quality of the film, particularly its cinematography, acting, and story. In the Malayan magazine Film Melayu, a reviewer considered the film of similar quality to Hollywood productions and praised its casting of a South East Asian as the titular detective. The critic and filmwriter Saeroen expressed concern that the film's success was not because of its quality, and opined that it was only popular because of Wijnhamer's fame.; Legacy Pah Wongso (left) with S. Waldy and M. Sarip in the sequel Pah Wongso Tersangka By September 1941, Jo had begun production of a second ‚Äì and final ‚Äì film starring Wongso, titled Pah Wongso Tersangka (Pah Wongso Becomes a Suspect). Directed by Wu Tsun, this late 1941 release featured Pah Wongso in four roles and showed him attempting to clear his name after being framed for a crime. Arief, Primo, and Sukran were also recast in this film, which was billed as the colony's first comedy film.; Although Joenara did not return for Pah Wongso Tersangka, she acted in three further films for Star; her acting career continued into the 1950s, and she became a producer in the early 1970s. Pah Wongso Pendekar Boediman may be lost. Movies were then shot on inflammable nitrate film, and after a fire destroyed much of Produksi Film Negara's warehouse in 1952, old films shot on nitrate were deliberately destroyed. Thus, the American visual anthropologist Karl G. Heider wrote that all Indonesian films from before 1950 are lost. However, JB Kristanto's Katalog Film Indonesia (Indonesian Film Catalogue) records several as having survived at Sinematek Indonesia's archives, and Biran writes that several Japanese propaganda films have survived at the Netherlands Government Information Service.

Life John was the fourth son of George Pitt (1663‚Äì1735) MP of Strathfieldsaye and second son by his second wife n√©e Lora Grey of Kingston Maurward nr Dorchester. He was educated at Queen's College, Oxford. The property enabling George Morton Pitt's control of the Pontefract seat came to John Pitt (of Encombe) by remainder but he sold it in 1766.

The borough was the town of Wareham on the Isle of Purbeck, a market town close to Poole Harbour. In 1831, the population of the borough was 1,676, and it contained 364 houses. * Dorchester - Held by John Pitt: 29 January 1751 - 1761 :Dorchester was a parliamentary constituency centred on the town of Dorchester in Dorset. It returned two Members of Parliament to the House of Commons. * Wareham - Held again by John Pitt: 1761‚Äì1768 Acts A procedure to allow resignation from the House of Commons was invented by Pitt to vacate his Wareham seat, as he wished to stand for Dorchester but could not be a candidate while still an MP. Pitt wrote to Prime Minister Henry Pelham in May 1750 reporting that he had been invited to stand in Dorchester, and asking for \\"a new mark of his Majesty's favour [to] enable me to do him these further services\\".'Pitt, John' in History of Parliament 1715‚Äì1754, vol II p. 350-1, citing Newcastle (Clumber) mss.

It is a concept piece over 23 minutes long, which comprises the whole B-side of the album. \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\" evolved in the studio, recorded in small sections and pieced together during mixing. The song has many changes in time signature and key signature, and even incorporates some musique concr√®te. Recording \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\" was recorded at intervals between gigs. It was recorded in small sections that were pieced together during mixing, and it took about three to four months to record, non- continuous.Christopulos & Smart, 126. According to producer John Anthony, the track features a lot more studio experimentation than on previous albums, saying \\"we pushed the facilities at Trident to the limit and had involved the use of every single tape machine in Trident at some stage.\\" The experiments included tape manipulation and Hugh Banton experimenting with Mellotron and synthesizer. According to David Jackson, one section of it features the entire band overdubbed 16 times. Robert Fripp provided a cameo appearance on electric guitar, which can be heard from 8:10‚Äì10:20 into the song and near the end of the song. (Fripp also had a cameo on Pawn Hearts track \\"Man-Erg\\".) Lyrics Peter Hammill, interviewed by Sounds, said: \\"It's just the story of the lighthouse keeper, that's it on its basic level. And there's the narrative about his guilt and his complexes about seeing people die and letting people die, and not being able to help. In the end ‚Äì well, it doesn't really have an end, it's really up to you to decide. He either kills himself, or he rationalises it all and can live in peace... Then on the psychic/religious level it's about him coming to terms with himself, and at the end there is either him losing it all completely to insanity, or transcendence; it's either way at the end... And then it's also about the individual coming to terms with society ‚Äì that's the third level...\\"Christopulos & Smart, 121. Live performance In between tours of Italy, in March 1972 the band made an appearance on Belgian television performing \\"Theme One\\" and \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\". Since the studio recording of \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\" was a collage of multiple recordings, impossible to reproduce live in one setting, the band had individual sections of the song filmed and spliced them together in the editing suite.Christopulos & Smart, 141. \\"We spent two hours working out 'Lighthouse Keepers' because we hadn't played it in months. We had to re-learn it\\", said Guy Evans. And Banton said: \\"It was very difficult, we had to film it in two halves\\", although from watching the DVD it seems there was more than one cut. The recording was released on DVD in February 2003 as Masters from the Vaults (incorrectly labelled as having been recorded in 1971). It is the only confirmed live performance of the song of the era, although it is mentioned that it was played live in Leeds in October 1971.Album notes by Ian Laycock in the booklet of the CD \\"The Box\\" (2000). Virgin Records. In 1977 and 1978, Van der Graaf, in a line-up of voice, piano, guitar, bass guitar, drums and violin (and in 1978 also cello) now and then played a medley in their set, called \\"Medley: A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers/Sleepwalkers\\". This song consisted of parts of \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\" and the second part of \\"The Sleepwalkers\\" (from the album Godbluff), glued together. Parts from \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\" that are used include \\"Eyewitness\\" and \\"The Clot Thickens\\". A rendition of this medley can be heard on the live album Vital (recorded January 1978), where it is 13:41 long in total. In concerts in 1978, 1979 and 1980 Peter Hammill played the medley solo on piano/keyboard (or with violin accompaniment) a number of times live. In March 2013, Peter Hammill announced that Van der Graaf Generator would play each night complete renditions of \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\" in the subsequent tour. A live version finally appeared on their live album Merlin Atmos, released in February 2015. Reception Allmusic calls the song \\"monumental\\", but believes it is \\"not as concise as it might've been\\". Mojo on the other hand, calls the song \\"preposterous\\".

It features Inigo Prabhakar, Vijay Sethupathi, Gayathrie, and Aishwarya Rajesh in the lead roles, while Soori and Joe Malloori play supporting roles. The music was composed by D. Imman with editing by Raja Mohammad and cinematography by C. Premkumar. The film was shot around Pudhukottai, Karaikudi and Thanjavur. It released on 31 January 2014 to moderate reviews. Plot Sakthi (Inigo Prabhakaran) joins a college in Sivagangai, where he meets his classmates Joseph (Vijay Sethupathi) and Meenakshi (Gayathrie). Sakthi and Joseph are hostel roommates and are very close. Meanwhile, Sakthi falls in love with Meenakshi, who happens to be the daughter of Periyavar (Joe Malloori), the headman of a nearby village. Periyavar and his family show at most casteism and go to the extent of killing anyone involved in an inter-caste marriage. Meenakshi fears for her father as he might kill Sakthi if he gets to know about her love. Sakthi and Joseph get expelled from the college hostel following a fight with another classmate, and come to Meenakshi‚Äôs village to stay. Joseph meets Swarna (Aishwarya Rajesh) in the village and develops a liking towards her, for which Swarna too reciprocates. It is revealed that Swarna is actually Meenakshi's elder sister. Periyavar finds about Swarna‚Äôs love affair and sets the stage to kill Joseph. However, Joseph and Swarna elope from the village and get married with the help of Sakthi and Meenakshi. Periyavar‚Äôs henchmen trace their location and beat up Joseph. In the process, Joseph is killed, and Swarna is taken back to her village and locked up in a room. In the meantime, Periyavar finds about Meenakshi's love affair and sets a plan to kill Sakthi. An angered Swarna kills Periyavar with a sickle before he could kill Sakthi. Thus, Swarna sets a full stop to Periyavar‚Äôs honor killing practice. Sakthi and Meenakshi get united at the end.

Balakrishnan, former assistant of N. Linguswamy who impressed him with his script. The film is said to be set in the 1980s. According to sources, Rummy is a dark romantic thriller. The first look was released on 4 October 2013. While it was reported that actress Remya Nambeesan, a trained classical singer, would be making her Tamil singing debut with this film, the song apparently doesn't appear in the soundtrack. Rummy has completed the mandatory Censor formality and it has been cleared with U certificate. Contrary to popular thought, Inigo Prabhakar plays the male lead role although the film was marketed as a Vijay Sethupathi film.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack album was composed by D. Imman to the lyrics penned by Yugabharathi. The audio rights were bought by Sony Music. The album was released by Kamal Haasan. Track list From Times of India.  Release  The satellite rights of the film were secured by Zee Thamizh. The film was supposed to release on 31 December 2013, but due to the presence of many big films it was postponed and released on 31 January 2014. Critical reception The film received mixed to positive reviews.‚ÄòRummy‚Äô Review Roundup: Gets Mixed Reaction - International Business Times Baradwaj Rangan wrote, \\"We keep waiting for something to happen and throw these aimless scenes into sharp relief. We await a twist in the tale. But there‚Äôs nothing...It‚Äôs a testament to the power of melodrama that the story turns mildly interesting in its final section, but the ending isn‚Äôt earned.

The Times of India gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"While it is, on the whole, a decent film, especially in the set-in-the-sickle-toting-south genre, Rummy is also wearisome, mainly because it is so predictable. There is a strong been-there-done-that whiff in the proceedings that you are hardly surprised and never really root for the characters\\". Sify wrote, \\"K.

The Hindustan Times gave 2.5 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"Rummy is often violent...There is more bloodshed and gore to come, more revenge and brutality -- sometimes treated with arrogant casualness. However, the high point of Balakrishnan's script is the shock it presents at the end\\".

The cochlear implant is considered to be the first invention to restore not just the sense of hearing, but any of the absent five senses in humans. Dr. House also pioneered approaches to the lateral skull base for removal of tumors, and is considered \\"the Father of Neurotology.\\" William F. House, MD Biography House was born on December 1, 1923, in Kansas City, Missouri, and moved to Whittier, California, when he was three years old. House completed pre-dental degrees at Whittier College and the University of Southern California. He then enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, where he received a doctorate in dentistry. House next earned a medical degree from the University of Southern California after two years in the U.S. Navy. His older half brother, Howard P. House, was also a physician and was focused on otology, founding the House Ear Institute (later renamed the House Research Institute) in 1946. William House eventually adopted the same focus. House was heavily criticized by physicians and surgeons during much of his career. Many believed his idea of a device to electrically stimulate the ear would never work. Today, however, he is generally regarded as a hero, in that his innovative research and development led to the creation of the modern cochlear implant. House's first design for a cochlear implant was surgically implanted in 1961, but the implant was rejected by the patient's body. A longer-lasting model was developed and successfully implanted in 1969, and it was introduced commercially in 1972. One of his patients was astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr., first American and the second person in space in 1961, and, thanks to Dr. House, 5th man to walk on the Moon in 1971 following a procedure he performed on him for Meniere's disease. In 1987, House was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science (Sc.D.) degree from Whittier College. House died on December 7, 2012, at his home in Aurora, Oregon, at the age of 89.

It was rebuilt by the Favre d'Echallens family in the 1860s, and survives unaltered, with a complete set of communs (multi-purpose outbuildings).  Origin and design  In the late 18th century the land on which the Ch√¢teau de Pleuville was built belonged to the Duverrier de Boulzat family, based at Ch√¢teau de Gorce, about two kilometres south of Pleuville village. Following the French Revolution, Pierre-Jacques Duverrier succeeded in retaining the family's existing properties and in acquiring other abandoned or forfeited estates. He also became mayor of the new commune of Pleuville, retaining this position until his death in 1829. One of his children, Antoine, inherited the Pleuville properties. On the 1825 plan cadastrale there is a long rectangular building near the village centre where the Ch√¢teau de Pleuville now stands,Service R√©gional de l'Inventaire de Poitou-Charentes and this was almost certainly adapted and raised in height to form the present structure.

Hardouin-Mansart), about 30 kilometres north of Pleuville. www.culture.gouv.fr The present three large granges (multi-purpose barns), the main gateway, and the moat are not present on the 1825 map and were also newly built. The age of the earlier long building is not known. Although of relatively recent date, the reconstruction was carried out in limestone and oak, using long-standing traditional methods. There are no typical 19th century embellishments on the exterior, which is stylistically indistinguishable from similar buildings of c.1750. In about 1830 Antoine Duverrier's daughter Marie-Emma-S√©raphine (1810-1886) married Jean-Joseph Favre d'Echallens (1801-1886). They acquired the chateau buildings and land, but do not appear with their household as Pleuville residents until the 1872 census. A reconstruction date of about 1865 therefore seems likely. Jean was mayor of Pleuville for a time; and S√©raphine's grave in Pleuville cemetery is inscribed ‚Äúd√©c√©d√©e en son ch√¢teau de Pleuville le 14 Mai 1886‚Äù. Members of the Favre family continued to be buried at Pleuville cemetery until the 1930s, but at some point the chateau was sold and it has had a number of owners and occupants since. The Communs The rebuilt chateau was provided with three extensive granges, placed at right angles to the south-east front of the house to create two new courtyards. Facilities included a large bakery with large and small ovens; the village jail; a coach house with farrier's forge, stables, tack room and coachman's lodge; a large cart shed; various areas for animals including a range of cow stalls; extensive storage areas; and a six-seat latrine. Thus equipped, the chateau with its park and farm would have been self-sufficient. The ensemble remains largely unaltered today. World War II The chateau has a significant connection with mar√©chal Jean de Lattre de Tassigny (1889-1952), who played a major role in 20th century French history as one of the four supreme allied commanders in the closing stages of the war. He was named after his great-grandfather Jean-Joseph Favre, and his grandmother Marie-Gabrielle (daughter of Jean-Joseph and Seraphine Favre who married Gaston de Lattre at Pleuville in 1854). General de Lattre was born at Mouilleron-en-Pareds in Vend√©e, lived much of his early life in Poitiers and stayed at Ch√¢teau de Pleuville in his youth. Jean de Lattre de Tassigny In 1939, people from eastern parts of France were evacuated to the Charente prior to the German invasion, and numerous families from Kalhausen in Moselle were accommodated in the Chateau, which was otherwise virtually unoccupied at the time. The armistice with Germany was signed in June 1940, and the evacuees returned home in August. Souvenirs de l‚Äô√©vacuation en Charente Under the terms of the armistice France was divided between the zone libre and zone occup√©e, The boundary between the two zones ran through Pleuville commune and a checkpoint was set up outside its cemetery. Later in the war there was strong local support for the resistance, and the chateau was used to store equipment and weapons; but it escaped damage when Pleuville was raided and set alight by a German unit in 1944.

Dakinis have been described in medieval Hindu texts such as the Bhagavata Purana, Brahma Purana, Markandeya Purana, and Kathasaritsagara as a female fiendish spirits in the train of Kali who feeds on human flesh.monier-williams , A Sanskrit dictionary 1899 Daayans are comparable to malevolent female spirits such as the succubi of Western folklore, they also resemble vampiresses by their alleged feeding behaviours that requires the blood or life-force of their victims.It is also said that powerful and older Daayan is also referred as Ekayan.The primary source of a daayan's power is her long plaited hair (\\"choti\\") that is used as an additional limb, it can be flexed, stretched, and retracted to do whatever the daayan pleases. The daayan is also described as having long and monstrous black nails, and feet that face backwards. It is said that once a daayan lays her evil eye on someone, it is a bad omen for the whole household of that person. She is regarded as the most powerful paranormal beingDavid Templeman, Iranian Themes in Tibetan Tantric Culture: The ·∏åƒÅkinƒ´ History The daayan cult refers to a secret society which emerged during the 15th century in Harangul, a village in the Latur district of Maharashtra. The concept of daayans has permeated Indian culture, and may be seen on popular television programs. Belief in daayans has existed in most regions of India, particularly Jharkhand and Bihar. \\"'Victims of witch-hunting are usually old or widowed women. These women are victimized for their property, or due to problems in the family or for sexual exploitation,' said Vasvi Kiro, a member of the Jharkhand Women's Commission.\\" It is prevalent in rural and semi-rural areas, with \\"witch-hunts\\" causing women to be killed or ostracised. In Harangul it is believed that daayan lives in an area of the village, and an evil spirit resides within them. Villagers believe these women destroy everything good. Daayans are reported in and around cemeteries, abandoned battlefields, crossroads, toilets and squalid places.Fane, Hannah (1975). \\"The Female Element in Indian Culture\\".

Weiser Books. p. 33. .https://www.bbc.com/news/health-33980904 Folklore suggests that a woman treated badly by her family or who died in childbirth as a result of family neglect returns as a daayan, haunting the family and drinking the blood of male family members.Cheung, Theresa (2006). The Element Encyclopedia of the Psychic World. Harper Element. p. 112. .

A daayan is also said to target young families, young women and other family surrogates.Bane, Theresa (2010). \\"Chedipe\\". Encyclopedia of Vampire Mythology. McFarland. pp. 47‚Äì8. ISBN 978-0786444526. Assuming the form of a young, attractive female, she hunts for young men on roads and seduces lone travellers into accompanying her. Imprisoning a man, she feeds on his age and blood. One legend says that a daayan will hold a young man captive until he is old, using him sexually until he dies and joins the spirit world. Another says that a young man seduced by the daayan who eats her food returns at dawn to the village as an old man.Melton, J. Gordon (1999). The Vampire Book: The Encyclopedia of the Undead. Visible Ink Press. p. 372. Differences between dayaans and churels Daayan is sometimes used interchangeably with the term churel ( cu·πõail), although conceptual and cultural differences exist between them. A churel is a vengeful ghost that arise from the death of a woman during pregnancy or childbirth, with preternatural powers similar to a witch. Indian witch stories vary across the country; the north Indian states believe that the churel (which lives near graveyards or in forests) can change its form and lure young men killing or having physical contact with them while in the western and eastern parts of India, it is believed that a Chudail looks like an old hag who lures small children away from their families to kill and eat them so as to keep herself younger. In the end Daayan is way more powerful than Chudail according old folk's of India. Folklore Some women are believed to be daayans, and (along with young children) are sometimes tortured and killed in rural areas. One of them is Jharkhand which ranks 24th out of 29 states in literacy. Witchcraft is a major social problem in this state, a large number of women are declared as witches and killed. It is prevalent because of belief in superstitions borne out of illiteracy and lack of education. The state is famous for an indigenous religion called Sarna. Similar to the puritan society of the 1600s, women here are not treated as equal to men. Hence single women, especially widows, are easy targets of witchcraft accusations.Singh SS.

Biography Galofre was born in Reus. His first art lessons were in the workshop of the amateur painter and wine merchant, Dom√®nec Soberano, when he was still quite young. Shortly after, his family moved to Barcelona, where he was enrolled at the Escola de la Llotja and studied with Ramon Mart√≠ Alsina.Gran Enciclop√®dia Catalana: Brief biography He later moved to Madrid to continue his studies. His first exhibition was at the \\"Exposici√≥ de Belles Arts del 1866\\" in Barcelona, where he presented his work \\"Els traginers\\" (The Porters). He later participated in the Barcelona exhibitions of 1870 and 1872, as well as one in Zaragoza in 1868, where he presented a series of landscapes depicting the hills of Montju√Øc and Vallvidrera as well as some maritime paintings. His watercolors won a silver medal at an exposition in Salamanca. From 1870 to 1882, he lived in Rome on a pension, granted by the First Republic, while he studied at the \\"Academia Espa√±ola de Bellas Artes de Roma\\", a branch of the Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando. At this time, he came under the influence of Mari√† Fortuny, but preserved his own style; especially his use of color.Esteban Casado Alcalde: Pintores de la Academia de Roma. La primera promoci√≥n.

At an exhibition in Madrid in 1890, one of his works was purchased by Queen Mar√≠a Cristina. In 1886, he became a regular contributor to the Sala Par√©s. His final work \\"El cavall m√©s valent\\" (The Bravest Horse) was left unfinished at his death, but sold for 20,000 Pesetas. He died in Barcelona, aged 57.

Cobalt have toured extensively in the US and Europe, including performances at Roadburn Festival in Tilburg, Netherlands and Maryland Deathfest. Background Cobalt began as a solo project of Phil McSorley, under the name Grimness Enshroud, who released one demo. Childhood friend Erik Wunder then joined the band and the name was changed to Cobalt in 2002. The name Cobalt was chosen because, in the words of Wunder, \\"we wanted a name that didn't entail anything. Something basic. Something elemental. The name 'Cobalt' leaves room for any variety of directions\\". Wunder drums and performs all of the guitars and bass on the studio albums, and performs the drums live. McSorley provided vocals until 2015, when he split with the band due to personal differences. Mcsorley was replaced by Chicago's Charlie Fell, who is the current front man and vocalist for Cobalt. Wunder and Fell met during the Jarboe/Nachtmystium European tour in 2010. Fell formerly played bass and vocals in black sludge metal band Lord Mantis. Aside from being in Cobalt, Phil McSorley has served tours of duty with the U.S. army in Iraq and South Korea, while Wunder fronts folk band Man's Gin and plays in experimental singer Jarboe's band. Debut and Eater of Birds The first album, War Metal, was mostly raw and primitive black metal, with the occasional hint of what Cobalt was to become. The following album, Eater of Birds, has been cited as \\"a great step in the bands evolution\\". Aside from being inspired by early 1990s black metal, the album embraced such influences as Neurosis and Swans, with Jarboe (of Swans) making guest appearances on Cobalt's last two albums. Eater of Birds has been described as featuring \\"70 minute monolith of blasting war metal, massive thrash riffs, drawn-out crescendoes and ritualistic interludes\\". Both albums were out of print for years and commanded high prices on webstores such as eBay, but in April 2013 Eater of Birds was reissued by Profound Lore. Gin The follow up to Eater of Birds, Gin, further cemented the duo as one of the very best forward thinking, envelope shredding purveyors of black metal that the US has to offer. It was released in 2009 to critical acclaim, being described as \\"an album that truly, viscerally expanded the possibilities of black metal, both musically and thematically\\". Among other accolades it was voted as the second best album of 2009 by Terrorizer. The album was largely inspired by two literary figures, Ernest Hemingway and Hunter Thompson. The front cover features a young Hemingway in army uniform, whereas the back cover has a bloated and aged Hemingway brandishing the same shotgun that he took his life with. A picture of Thompson shooting his typewriter is in the center of the inlay. Slow Forever McSorley has stated that the band plan on recording a new album following their East Coast tour in May 2013, and that it will be entitled Slow Forever. On March 17, 2014, McSorley announced via the band's Facebook page that he was quitting Cobalt. He gave Wunder his blessings to continue with the project, if Wunder so chooses. A month later McSorley announced that he and Wunder would indeed be recording Slow Forever together and that their differences had been settled. On December 16, 2014, Wunder announced via Cobalt's Facebook page that, once again....and for good this time, Phil was out of the project due to certain personal differences and viewpoints expressed that aren't agreeable to the band. On June 23, 2015, Cobalt revealed that Wunder was officially in the studio and actively recording Slow Forever, with a tentative release date of early 2016. Two days later, Cobalt also revealed on their Facebook page the identity of its new vocalist. Charlie Fell (ex-Lord Mantis) will be contributing to the new album. It was confirmed on 26 January 2016, that the new album will be released on 25 March 2016, via Profound Lore Records, and will be a double album.

In 1926, he began manufacturing spraying equipment for fields and gardens, marketing Denmark's first mechanized sprayer by the end of the same year. By that time he was employing 14 workmen. He also made a success of stationary engines for winching. While continuing his engine business, he later also moved into radios which he assembled himself until he met competition from larger manufacturers. In 1936, Sigvardt organized the Brohallen bridge exhibition in Orehoved in connection with the building of the Storstr√∏m Bridge. In 1951, he had 12 houses built in the town for his factory employees. In 1970, the Sigvardt factory was taken over by Hardi International. It has now moved to N√∏rre Alslev where it is the town's largest employer.\\"375-1 G√•bense\\" , Museum-online.dk. Retrieved 16 December 2012.

The work was exhibited in Paris at the Salon des Ind√©pendants (20 March‚Äì16 May) in 1912 and the Salon de la Section d'Or, 1912.Exhibit catalog for Salon de \\"La Section d'Or\\", 1912, Jean Metzinger, La Femme au cheval, p. 11, no. 116. Walter Pach papers, Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution The following year La Femme au Cheval was reproduced in The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations by Guillaume Apollinaire (1913). The artist has broken down the picture plane into facets, presenting multiple aspects of the subject simultaneously. This concept first pronounced by Metzinger in 1910‚Äîsince considered a founding principle of Cubism‚Äîwould soon find its way into the foundations of the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics; the fact that a complete description of one and the same subject may require diverse points of view which defy a unique description. The painting was owned by the poet Joseph Houot (known as Jacques Nayral). In 1918 La Femme au Cheval was exhibited at International Kunst, Kleis Kunsthandel, Copenhagen, an exhibition arranged by Herwarth Walden.Der Sturm, 'International Kunst, Ekspressionister og Kubister, Malerier og Skulpturer', Kleis Kunsthandel, K√∏benhavn 1918, Herwarth Walden (titled Kone med hest, cat. 82) It was presumably bought by a Danish collector in 1918. The painting was subsequently sold at auction through art dealer Kai Grunth hos Winkel & Magnussen, auction no. 108, February 19, 1932, lot no. 119. Purchased by Danish physicist Niels Bohr. After his death Woman with Horse was sold by his widow Margrethe Bohr (through Ernest Bohr) to the Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen. It is now in the Royal Collection of Paintings and Sculpture at the museum.Statens Museum for Kunst (in Danish) Description La Femme au Cheval is an oil painting on canvas with dimensions 162 x 130.5 cm (63.8 x 51.4 in). As the title indicates the painting represents a woman and a horse. The rather elegant woman wearing only a pearl necklace and the horse are immersed in a landscape with trees and a window (in the 'background'), a vase, with fruits and vegetation (in the 'foreground') clearly taken from the natural world. Roger Allard, in his review of the 1912 Salon des Ind√©pendants, noted Metzinger's 'refined choice of colors' and the 'precious rarity' of the painting's 'mati√®re'. Andr√© Salmon also noted Metzinger's 'refined use of color' in La Femme au Cheval and praised its 'French grace', while thanking Metzinger for having, for the first time, 'illuminated a cubist figure with the virtues of a smile'.David Cottington, Cubism and Its Histories, Manchester University Press, 2004 :\\"In the absence of more evidence than such brief snatches of commentary in wide- ranging salon reviews can provide, we can only speculate\\" writes Cottington \\"as to whether Metzinger intended, or its initial audience read, the provocative juxtaposition in this painting of a naked woman with horse, and of natural with cosmetic adornment, as a follow-up to Tea Time's essay on sensation and the viewer's apprehension of it.\\" :\\"After the clarity and measure of the demonstration piece that was Tea-Time,\\" writes Cottington, \\"Metzinger reprised those qualities in the large Woman on a Horse, shown at the Ind√©pendants of 1912. Through its fussy geometry we can discern a nude woman, her limbs and upper torso picked out in sensuous chiaroscuro, perched side-saddle on a studio prop-horse and stroking its mane (visible top right)...\\" The nude woman is in fact not perched side-saddle on the horse. As others have pointed out (Antliff and Leighten),Mark Antliff, Patricia Dee Leighten, Cubism and Culture, Thames & Hudson, 2001 and as emerges upon close examination, the nude woman is seated on what appears to be a rectangular block or cube, perhaps a model's pedestal (visible to the left). The horse occupies the upper right-hand quadrant as if observed from above. Its head is turned toward the monumental nude while she strokes the horses right ear with her left hand. She cups her hand underneath the horse's mouth, as if feeding the horse a piece of fruit. Georges Seurat, 1891, Le Cirque (The Circus), oil on canvas, 185 x 152 cm, Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris The reconstruction of the total image was left, according to Metzinger, to 'creative intuition' of the observer. While one viewer may see a woman riding a horse, another may see her sitting beside the horse, and yet others may not see a horse at all. That there even exists such ambiguity with respect to what is transpiring on the canvas is remarkable. According to the founders of Cubist theory, objects possess no absolute or essential form. \\"There are as many images of an object as there are eyes which look at it; there are as many essential images of it as there are minds which comprehend it.\\"Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, Du \\"Cubisme\\", Paris, 1912, in Robert L. Herbert, Modern Artists on Art, Englewood Cliffs, 1964. The nude figure sitting to the left, the horse standing to the right, along with other elements of the painting are depicted in a faceted manner, based to some extent on non-Euclidean geometry. Denying the illusion of Renaissance perspective the artist breaks down the figures and background into facets and planes, presenting multiple aspects of the subject all at once. This can be seen in the deliberate positioning of light, shadow, form and color, in the way in which Metzinger assimilates the union of the background, woman and horse. For example, the division of the model's features generates a subtle profile view, the vase is shown both from above and the side. The resulting free and mobile perspective, 'simultaneity' of multiple view-points, was used by Metzinger to constitute the image of a whole‚Äîone that includes the fourth dimension‚Äîwhat he called 'total image'.Alex Mittelmann, State of the Modern Art World, The Essence of Cubism and its Evolution in Time, Nov. 2011 Background: color, form and motion Georges Seurat, 1889‚Äì90, Le Chahut, oil on canvas, 171.5 x 140.5 cm (66 7/8 x 54 3/4 in), Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum, Otterlo, Netherlands Where the dialectic nature of Paul C√©zanne's work had been influential between 1908 and 1910 during the expressionistic phase of Cubism, the flat, linear structures of Georges Seurat would capture the attention of the Cubists from 1911. In addition to the flattened depth of field, the colors (subtle blues, raw umber and burnt sienna) employed in La Femme au Cheval bear a resemblance to the colors of Seurat's 1889‚Äì90 Le Chahut and his 1887‚Äì88 Parade de Cirque. :\\"With the advent of monochromatic Cubism in 1910‚Äì1911,\\" Robert Herbert writes, \\"questions of form displaced color in the artists' attention, and for these Seurat was more relevant. Thanks to several exhibitions, his paintings and drawings were easily seen in Paris, and reproductions of his major compositions circulated widely among the Cubists. The Chahut (Kr√∂ller-M√ºller Museum, Otterlo) was called by Andr√© Salmon \\"one of the great icons of the new devotion\\", and both it and the Circus (Mus√©e d'Orsay, Paris), according to Apollinaire, \\"almost belong to Synthetic Cubism\\".Robert Herbert, Neo-Impressionism, The Solomon R.

Muybridge often traveled to Europe to promote his work and he met √âtienne-Jules Marey in 1881. His freeze-framed images of galloping horses evoked time and motion. Displayed in a grid, the horse is captured in split- second intervals. Because the horse's movement was too fast for the human eye to register, there was a scientific debate in the 1870s questioning (Marey's hypothesis originally) whether all four hooves ever left the ground simultaneously. To prove that Marey was right Muybridge (in Palo Alto, California) carried out his \\"Photographic Investigation\\". His photographs settled the debate, though skeptics remained. 'Many people didn't believe it,' Brookman writes, 'They thought they were fake because the horse looked so strange'.Philip Brookman, Helios: Eadweard Muybridge in a Time of Change, Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, DC, 2010 (Steidl).Neda Ulaby, Muybridge: The Man Who Made Pictures Move, 2010Philip Brookman, with contributions by Marta Braun, Andy Grundberg, Corey Keller and Rebecca Solnit, Eadweard Muybridge, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Tate Pub., 2010 In an interview with Katherine Kuh, Marcel Duchamp spoke about his 1912 Nude Descending a Staircase and its relation to the photographic motion studies of Muybridge and Marey: > \\"In 1912... the idea of describing the movement of a nude coming downstairs > while still retaining static visual means to do this, particularly > interested me.

The images captured from multiple spatial view-points and at successive time intervals are shown simultaneously on the canvas.Joann Moser, Cubist Works, 1910‚Äì1921, p. 43, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art (J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press) The anti-Hellenic concept of representing a subject from multiple view-points was a central idea of Jean Metzinger's Note sur la Peinture, 1910.Note sur la peinture, Jean Metzinger, Pan (Paris), October‚ÄìNovember 1910Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art (J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press) p. 9-23Cubisme et tradition, Jean Metzinger, Paris Journal, 16 August 1911 Indeed, prior to Cubism painters worked from the limiting factor of a single view-point. And it was Jean Metzinger, for the first time in Note sur la peinture who enunciated the stimulating interest in representing objects as remembered from successive and subjective experiences within the context of both space and time. In that article, Metzinger writes about the works of Robert Delaunay, Henri Le Fauconnier, Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso, noting that they \\"discarded traditional perspective and granted themselves the liberty of moving around objects.\\" All four, according to Metzinger, held in common the notion of simultanety. This is the concept of \\"mobile perspective\\" that would tend towards the representation of the \\"total image.\\" Though he does not discuss his own work in Note sur la peinture, clearly at the time of writing he had already discarded classical perspective (Nu, Landscape and Nu √† la chemin√©e (Nude), c. 1908, 1909 and 1910 respectively) turning his attention fully towards the geometric abstraction of form.S.

Published in Au Salon d'Automne \\"Les Ind√©pendants\\" 1912, Exhibited at the 1912 Salon d'Automne, Paris The idea exemplified in La Femme au Cheval of moving around an object in order to see it from different view-points was elaborated upon in Du \\"Cubisme\\" (1912),Du \\"Cubisme\\", Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes, Edition Figui√®re, Paris, 1912 (First English edition: Cubism, Unwin, London, 1913) written in collaboration with Albert Gleizes. In addition to being illustrated in Du \\"Cubisme\\", Metzinger's La Femme au Cheval is also reproduced in Les Peintres Cubistes by Guillaume Apollinaire, 1913. Metzinger and Gleizes wrote with reference to non-Euclidean geometry in Du \\"Cubisme\\". It was argued that Cubism itself was not based on any geometrical theory, but that non- Euclidean geometry corresponded better than classical, or Euclidean geometry, to what the Cubsists were doing. The essential was in the understanding of space other than by the classical method of perspective; an understanding that would include and integrate the fourth dimension with 3-space.Linda Henderson, The Fourth Dimension and NonEuclidean geometry in Modern Art, 1983 The reconstruction of the total image was left to the creative intuition of the observer. The spectator now played an active role. Taken at face value, each of the constituent parts (the fragments or facets) are just as important as the whole. Yet, the total image, greater than the sum of the parts of which it is composed, now resides in the mind of the beholder. The dynamism of form implicit or explicit in the quantitative and qualitative properties of the work, set in motion by the artist, could be reassembled and understood in a dynamic process no longer solely restricted to the artist and subject matter. Essentially, if the permutations and simultanism of Cubism was to be understood, the observer was left with no other option but to participate in the creative process. The other option resulted in the misunderstanding and alienation of the spectator. Albeit, the latter was not a viable option for Metzinger, whose intention had been to diffuse Cubism to a wider audience. At the same time, Metzinger new full well that to varying degrees a barrier would remain, insurmountable, between the exclusive intellectual geometric deliberations of Cubism practiced by the Section d'Or group and popular culture. \\"But we cannot enjoy in isolation\\" wrote the two principle theorists of Cubism in 1912, \\"we wish to dazzle others with that which we daily snatch from the world of sense, and in return we wish others to show us their trophies.\\" This 'reciprocity' between artist and public is perhaps one of the reasons Metzinger felt the need to include elements of the real world into his paintings of the period, untouched by the wrath of mobile perspective. \\"The reminiscence of natural forms cannot be absolutely banished; not yet, at all events\\" wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, for art, to them, could not \\"be raised to the level of a pure effusion at the first step.\\" Woman with a Horse was conceived in such a way that the viewer is obliged to contemplate the manifold surface of the painting for an extended period of time, piecing together the recognizable forms, not just in space, but in time; due to the temporal evolution resulting from the act of moving around the subject (during the painting process). Only then do the more obscure structures become legible with the topological context of the multi-dimension space of the whole. The radical new concept based on non-conventional precepts of space and time transformed the canvas from something quasi-static to something that possessed dynamic evolutionary characteristics. No longer governed by Euclidean geometry (or classical Renaissance perspective), Metzinger's Woman with a Horse is composed of a series of ellipses, curvilinear and rectilinear structures and planes juxtaposed and distributed throughout the canvas in complex myriad combinations of abstract volumetric forms that suggest rather than define the underlying subject. Though the rupture with the past seemed total, there was still within La Femme au Cheval something of the past. Metzinger, for example, writes in a Pan article, two years before the publication of Du \\"Cubisme\\" that the greatest challenge to the modern artist is not to 'cancel' tradition, but to accept \\"it is in us\\", acquired by living. It was the combination of the past with the present, and its progression into the future that most intrigued Metzinger:Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of Art, p. 11 Jean Metzinger, 1910, Nu √† la chemin√©e (Nude). Exhibited at the 1910 Salon d'Automne. Published in Les Peintres Cubistes by Guillaume Apollinaire in 1913 > \\"If we wished to relate the space of the [Cubist] painters to geometry, we > should have to refer it to the non-Euclidean mathematicians; we should have > to study, at some length, certain of Riemann's theorems.\\" The concept of observing a subject from different points in space and time simultaneously (multiple or mobile perspective) \\"to seize it from several successive appearances, which fused into a single image, reconstitute in time\\" developed by Metzinger (in his article, Cubisme et tradition, Paris Journal, 16 August 1911) and observed in La Femme au Cheval was not derived from Albert Einstein's theory of relativity, though it was certainly influenced in a similar way, through the work of Jules Henri Poincar√© (particularly Science and Hypothesis). Poincar√©'s writings, unlike Einstein's, were well known leading up to 1912. Poincar√©'s widely read book, La Science et l'Hypoth√®se, was published in 1902 (by Flammarion). The French mathematician Maurice Princet discussed the work of Poincar√©, along with the concept of the fourth spatial dimension, to artists at the Bateau-Lavoir. He was a close associate of Pablo Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, Max Jacob, Marcel Duchamp and Jean Metzinger. Princet is known as \\"le math√©maticien du cubisme.\\" Princet brought to attention of these artists a book entitled Trait√© √©l√©mentaire de g√©om√©trie √† quatre dimensions by Esprit Jouffret (1903) a popularization of Poincar√©'s Science and Hypothesis. In this book Jouffret described hypercubes and complex polyhedra in four dimensions projected onto a two-dimensional page. Princet was close to Metzinger and participated in meetings of the Section d'Or in Puteaux, giving informal lectures to the artists, many of whom were passionate about mathematical order. In 1910, Metzinger said of him, \\"[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician Maurice Princet has deduced a whole geometry\\". The similarity of Metzinger's own work of 1910 to that of Picasso is exemplified in his Nu √† la chemin√©e (Nude), exhibited at the 1910 Salon d'Automne. The style of lips in both Metzinger's Nude and Picasso's Portrait of Wilhelm Uhde (spring-automn 1910) bear a resemblance to each other (both are in the form of an \\"X\\"). So too, both pictures merge the model with the environment, blurring the distinction between background and foreground. Metzinger, however‚Äîin addition to the simultaneous views and multiple perspective‚Äîhas included the image of a clock in the upper right quadrant, a fact that reveals Metzinger's didactic visual and literary reference to Poincar√© and Bergsonian 'duration'. Reviewing the 1910 Salon d'Automne Roger Allard wrote of the 'new innovators': > \\"Metzinger's nude and his landscape are ruled by an equal striving for > fragmentary synthesis. No usual clich√© from the aesthetic vocabulary fits > the art of this disconcerting painter. Consider the elements of his nude: a > woman, a clock, an armchair, a table, a vase with flowers...such, at least, > is an account of my personal inventory. The head whose expression is very > noble is rendered formally, and the artist seems to have drawn back from the > integral application of his law. [...] The analytical kinships among objects > and their mutual subordinations will be henceforth of little importance\\", > Allard continues, \\"since they will be suppressed in the painted realization. > These come into play later, subjectively, in each individual's mental > realization\\". (Allard, 1910)Daniel Robbins, Jean Metzinger: At the Center of > Cubism, 1985, Jean Metzinger in Retrospect, The University of Iowa Museum of > Art (J. Paul Getty Trust, University of Washington Press) p. 15 What Allard means, according to art historian Daniel Robbins, is that in the treatment of the nude's head, Metzinger retreats from the bold ideas exhibited in the rest of the painting. \\"The importance of Allard's understanding of the genuine innovation visible at the salon is hard to overestimate.\\" Robbins writes, \\"He goes well beyond Metzinger's emphasis in the Pan article on multiple points of view, that is, beyond the technical innovations of the new painting. He penetrates to its intellectual core: an art capable of synthesizing a reality in the mind of the observer...\\" Influence on quantum mechanics Jean Metzinger, La Femme au Cheval, hanging in the office of Niels Bohr (the Danish physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum mechanics, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922) Arthur I. Miller, author of Einstein, Picasso: Space, Time and the Beauty that Causes Havoc (2002), writes: \\"Cubism directly helped Niels Bohr discover the principle of complementarity in quantum theory, which says that something can be a particle and a wave at the same time, but it will always be measured to be either one or the other. In analytic cubism, artists tried to represent a scene from all possible viewpoints on one canvas.\\" Miller continues: \\"An observer picks out one particular viewpoint. How you view the painting, that‚Äôs the way it is. Bohr read the book by Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes on cubist theory, Du \\"Cubisme\\". It inspired him to postulate that the totality of an electron is both a particle and a wave, but when you observe it you pick out one particular viewpoint.\\"Miller, A. From issue 2523 of New Scientist magazine, 29 October 2005, page 44 Niels Bohr (1885‚Äì1962), the Danish physicist and one of the principle founders of quantum mechanics, moved into a mansion owned by the Carlsberg Foundation (where he and his family resided after 1932)French, A.

For inspiration Bohr hung in his office a large painting by Jean Metzinger, La Femme au Cheval,Abraham Pais, Niels Bohr's Times: In Physics, Philosophy, and Polity, Clarendon Press, 1991, p. 335, one of Metzinger's most conspicuous early examples of 'mobile perspective' implementation (also called simultaneity). Bohr, vitally interested in the rapid changes taking place in modern art, took great pleasure talking about La Femme au Cheval and in giving \\"form to thoughts to an audience at first unable to see anything in Metzinger's painting‚ÄîThey came with a preconceived idea\\", according to the Danish artist and writer Mogens Andersen.Anderson, Mogens, 1967: \\"An Impression\\" in Niels Bohr: His Life and Work as seen by his friends and colleagues, New York: Interscience Publishers, pp. 321-324 His lectures had been meant to parallel \\"the lessons painfully learned by atomic physicists,\\" writes Miller, \\"who realized the inadequacy of visual perception when they discarded the visual imagery of the solar system atom after 1923.\\"Miller, A., 2002, Einstein, Picasso: space, time and the beauty that causes havoc, Basic Books, New York, 2001, pp. 166-169, 256-258 To this problem Bohr developed a solution in 1927 with striking similarities to Metzinger's concept of multiple perspective: the principle of complementarity, which Bohr summarized as follows: > [...] the account of the experimental arrangements and of the results of the > observations must be expressed in unambiguous language with suitable > application of the terminology of classical physics. [...] Consequently, > evidence obtained under different experimental conditions cannot be > comprehended within a single picture, but must be regarded as complementary > in the sense that only the totality of the phenomenena exhausts the possible > information about the objects.Niels Bohr (1949). Discussions with Einstein > on Epistemological Problems in Atomic Physics. In P. Schilpp. Albert > Einstein: Philosopher-Scientist. Open Court. Bohr was the first to point out the ‚Äòindivisibility of the quantum of action‚Äô, his way of describing the uncertainty principle, implying that not all aspects of a system can be viewed simultaneously. For example, the wave‚Äìparticle duality of physical objects are such complementary phenomena. Both concepts are borrowed from classical mechanics, i.e., measurements such as the double- slit experiment can demonstrate one or the other, but not both phenomena at a particular moment in time or position in space. It is impossible to empirically demonstrate both phenomena simultaneously.Bohr, N. (1927/1928). The quantum postulate and the recent development of atomic theory, Nature Supplement April 14 1928, 121: 580‚Äì590 This was perhaps the first manifestation of interest in Cubism on the part of a leading representative of the physics community.Peter Brooke, Letter to Arthur Miller, A commentary on Arthur Miller's book Einstein - Picasso: Space, Time and the beauty that causes havoc Bohr's interest in the new art, Miller notes, was anchored in the writings of Metzinger. He concludes: \\"If cubism is the result of the science in Art, the quantum theory is the result of art in science.\\" In the epistemological words of Bohr, 1929: > ...depending upon our arbitrary point of view...we must, in general, be > prepared to accept the fact that a complete elucidation of one and the same > object may require diverse points of view which defy a unique description. > (Niels Bohr, 1929)Niels Bohr, 1929, Wirkungsquantum und Naturbeschreibung', > Die Naturwissenschaften 17 (The Quantum of Action and Description of > Nature), pp. 483-486) Within the context of Cubism, artists were forced into the position of re- evaluating the role of the observer. Classical linear and aerial perspective, uninterrupted surface transitions and chiaroscuro were pushed aside. What remained was a series of images obtained by the observer (the artist) in different frames of reference as the object was being painted. Essentially, observations became linked through a system of coordinate transformations. The result was Metzinger's 'total image' or a combination of successive images. Le Port (The Harbor).

Dimensions and current location unknown In Metzinger's theory, the artist and the object being observed became equivocally linked so that the results of any observation seemed to be determined, at least partially, by actual choices made by the artist. \\"An object has not one absolute form; it has many,\\" Metzinger wrote. Furthermore, part of the role of placing together various images was left to the observer (the one looking at the painting). The object represented, depending on how the observer perceives it, could have as many forms \\"as there are planes in the region of perception.\\" (Jean Metzinger, 1912)Gayana Jurkevic, 2000, In pursuit of the natural sign- Azor√≠n and the poetics of Ekphrasis, pp. 200-213 Salon des Ind√©pendants, 1912 The Salon des Ind√©pendants transpired in Paris from 20 March to 16 May 1912. This massive exhibition occurred exactly one year after Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, L√©ger and Laurencin were shown together in Room 41 of the 1911 Salon des Ind√©pendants, which provoked the scandal out of which Cubism emerged and spread throughout Paris with wide-ranging repercussions in Germany, the Netherlands, Italy, Russia, Spain and elsewhere (influencing Futurism, Suprematism, Constructivism, De Stijl and so on). Just five months prior to this show another polemic developed at the Salon d'Automne of 1912. Originating in Salle XI where the Cubists exhibited their works, this quarrel involved both the French and non-French avant-garde artists. On 3 December 1912 the polemic reached the Chambre des d√©put√©s and was debated at the Assembl√©e Nationale. At stake was more than just the future of public funding for exhibitions that included Cubist art.B√©atrice Joyeux-Prunel, Histoire & Mesure, no.

Andr√© Salmon too, in his review, noted Metzinger's 'refined use of color' in La Femme au Cheval and praised its 'French grace', while noting Metzinger 'illuminated a cubist figure with the virtues of a smile'.

Depicting Queen Victoria, it was only valid for local postage and it was originally issued on 1 December 1860. It was the only stamp issued by Malta for two and a half decades, and during this period various reprints were made with differences in colour shade, perforation and watermark. When control of Malta's postal service was transferred to the islands' colonial government on 1 January 1885, the stamp was withdrawn and it was replaced by a set of definitive stamps.  Design, production and issue  An experimental free daily postal service for letters and newspapers was introduced between Valletta, the Three Cities, Gozo and some of the larger towns in Malta on 10 June 1853. British postage stamps were introduced in the islands in August 1857 for use on mail sent from Malta to foreign destinations. In 1859, the Council of Government decided that the free local postal service was to be withdrawn, and on 12 March 1859 the Committee of Supply set aside the sum of ¬£110 for the cost of ordering a halfpenny stamp for local postage. The government informed the Crown Agents of this on 30 April 1859, who then commissioned the British printing company De La Rue to engrave a die for the new stamp. The stamp depicts a portrait of Queen Victoria wearing a diadem, set on an octagonal shield surrounded by olive leaves. The die was engraved by Jean Ferdinand Joubert de la Fert√©, and die proofs were ready by 21 June. Specimen stamps were sent to Malta later on in the year, and they were approved by the government. The initial printing consisted of 100 sheets of 240 stamps each, and it was sent to Malta on 21 July 1859. The introduction of the stamp was announced in a Government notice dated 16 November 1860, and it was issued on 1 December so as to coincide with the start of the financial year. The stamp paid the local letter rate of ¬Ωd per half ounce (14g), and it had no validity on mail addressed to foreign destinations, which continued to be franked with British stamps. The new stamp was sold from the General Post Office at Valletta, police stations and some stationers. The earliest known use of the stamp is a letter dated 13 December 1860 which was sent by Giorgio Grognet de Vass√© in Valletta to Giuseppe Said in Mosta. This particular letter sold for ¬£5800 at an auction in December 2009.  Printings and technical details  A wing marginal stamp from the 1863 printing The initial printing which was issued on 1 December 1860 consisted of stamps in a buff colour which were printed on blued unwatermarked paper. Between 1861 and 1884, 28 reprints of the stamp were made in a variety of different colour shades, on paper with a different watermark, and with differing perforations. The first few printings were on unwatermarked paper, while stamps printed between 1863 and 1881 had a Crown CC watermark. The last few printings which were made between 1882 and 1884 had a Crown CA watermark. These watermarks consisted of the letters \\"CC\\" or \\"CA\\" (both referring to the Crown Agents for the Colonies) beneath a representation of a crown. Varieties of some stamps also exist in which the watermarks are inverted or reversed. Most of the Halfpenny Yellow stamps were perforated with a gauge of 14, but printings in 1868 and 1870 had a gauge 12¬Ω which was rough in the former and clean-cut in the latter. Another two printings in 1878 and 1879 had a perforation of 14 x 12¬Ω. Prior to 1878, the gutter between the panes of stamps in the sheet was perforated centrally, resulting in the stamps along the gutter having a large wing margin. After 1878, the configuration of the perforator was changed such that wing marginal stamps were no longer produced. In 1883, plans were being made to transfer control of Malta's postal services to the colonial government, and it was therefore proposed that the colour of the halfpenny stamp be changed from yellow to green in accordance with Universal Postal Union guidelines. In addition, new denominations of stamps would be needed to cater for postal rates to foreign destinations. A printing of ¬Ωd stamps in green was made in 1883 but was not issued immediately, while a final printing of the ¬Ωd yellow was made in 1884. The transfer of control took place on 1 January 1885 when the Malta Post Office was established. At this point, a new definitive set of six stamps including the ¬Ωd green which had been printed in 1883 was introduced, replacing both the Halfpenny Yellows and the British stamps used in Malta.  Collecting  An 1862 stamp catalogue by Frederick Booty illustrating the Halfpenny Yellow along with some stamps from Mauritius When the Halfpenny Yellow was first issued in 1860, stamp collecting was emerging as a popular new hobby in Europe. In some early philatelic literature, the stamp's issue date was incorrectly identified as 1861. There were a number of stamp collectors in Malta by the mid-1860s and early philatelists (then called timbrophilists) began to identify variations in the different printings. Some versions of the stamp such as that on bluish paper quickly became sought after, particularly by French collectors. In contemporary philatelic literature, some printings of the stamp were praised while others were poorly received. In a November 1866 article in The Stamp Collector's Magazine, an anonymous Maltese collector identified stamps from an 1864 printing in orange as \\"the best that have as yet been circulated in the island, their bright colour bringing out the beauties of the engraving\\", but criticized a subsequent printing in buff as being \\"the ugliest stamp of the British colonies\\". In an earlier edition of the magazine from August 1866, the same anonymous author had lamented that Malta only used local halfpenny stamps while other British colonies had stamps for international mail. In a letter to the editor, the collector proposed that the islands should issue stamps featuring local symbols such as the Maltese cross which were absent from the Halfpenny Yellow. The Halfpenny Yellow stamps are highly sought after by stamp collectors, and their value varies considerably depending on the scarcity of the particular version of the stamp. As of 2015, the catalogue prices of a mint Halfpenny Yellow range from ¬£18 to ¬£1300 in the Stanley Gibbons catalogue, while those of a used stamp range between ¬£35 and ¬£650 (excluding errors such as inverted or reversed watermarks which are sometimes worth more). The earliest printings of 1860‚Äì1863 on unwatermarked paper are among the most expensive, while the latest printings of 1882‚Äì1884 with the Crown CA watermark are the cheapest. A number of forgeries of Halfpenny Yellow stamps exist, most notably by Jean de Sperati.  Legacy  Malta stamp depicting Edward VII within the frame of the Halfpenny Yellow The ¬Ωd green which replaced the Halfpenny Yellows was in regular use from 1885 to 1903, and due to its long period of use it is a very common stamp. In 1899, this stamp was also issued with overprints for revenue purposes. After Queen Victoria died and was succeeded by King Edward VII, the new stamps which depicted the king had designs which were based on the Halfpenny Yellow. Between 1903 and 1911, various stamps with denominations ranging from ¬Ωd to 5/- were issued which featured the king's portrait set within the octagonal frame of the 1860 stamp. Some of these were also issued with revenue overprints between 1904 and 1912, and one was issued with a war tax overprint in 1918. On 1 December 1960, Malta issued a set of three stamps on stamps depicting the Halfpenny Yellow along with Queen Elizabeth II to commemorate the centenary of the stamp's issue. The stamp is also depicted on Malta's first postal card, which was issued on 6 May 1980 on the occasion of the London 1980 International Stamp Exhibition. The Maltex 2010 philatelic exhibition, which was held by the Malta Philatelic Society at the Hotel Phoenicia between 8 and 10 October 2010, was dedicated to the Halfpenny Yellow to coincide with the stamp's 150th anniversary. The exhibition included a number of displays which focused on the stamp and souvenirs which depicted it were also produced. On 1 December, MaltaPost commemorated the anniversary by issuing a miniature sheet depicting the earliest recorded cover with the Halfpenny Yellow as a stamp on stamp. For the occasion, the company also held an exhibition and talks about Maltese postal history at the National Library of Malta between 2 December 2010 and 8 January 2011. The 1860 stamp was also depicted on the cover of the year pack which contained all the stamps issued by MaltaPost during 2010.

The main top entrance, Short Drop Cave, is a small hole in a fenced off shakehole near the main stream sink; Gavel Pot, a window into the system, is a large fenced shakehole some deep requiring tackle to descend. There are two other smaller entrances into Short Drop Cave. At its base the system links via a sump with Lost Johns' Cave, and is part of the Three Counties System, an cave system which spans the borders of Cumbria, Lancashire, and North Yorkshire. Description The main entrance into Short Cave is at the end of a shallow valley where a small hole drops into a stream passage. Upstream leads to a canal passage which becomes too tight, although an excavated squeeze on the right before the end leads to the Coal Hole entrance. Downstream, of mainly low passage leads to an oxbow with a larger passage arriving from Rift Entrance. A long awkward inlet passage called Masochist Passage can be followed to the north-east for some almost up to the Rumbling Hole stream sinks, and an old high level route named Ancient Highway loops back to the main route. Downstream continues as a canyon passage which steadily enlarges, passing an inlet passage on the left where the main water enters which can be followed up to where it becomes choked with boulders underneath the stream sink. The main passage continues for about up to high and wide, under a boulder bridge wedged across the passage, to finish in a choke in a roof chamber. The water then follows a narrow meandering canyon to the first waterfall pitch of , and continues to a second pitch of at the base of which the water disappears into a choked sump pool. A traverse can be followed over the top of the pitch round to where a pitch enters from the Gavel Pot doline. Rift Entrance () is a currently blocked entrance just over the wall from the main sink. A climb down enters a rift chamber, where a passage enters the First Oxbow in Short Drop Cave. Coal Hole Entrance () is located in a small shakehole SE of Rumbling Hole. A long crawl eventually reaches a bedding chamber with a coal seam exposed in the walls where an excavated squeeze drops into Canals Inlet in Short Drop Cave. Gavel Pot () consists of a steep-sided shakehole some deep, and in circumference - reputedly the largest shakehole in England. Scrambling down the eastern side, a ledge is reached where an pitch lands at the end of the traverse from Short Drop Cave. In the other direction a high canyon passage soon enters the bottom of the Gavel Pot shakehole, overlooked by rocky ramparts. In the corner a further pitch over a chockstone lands in a chamber where an excavated drop lands in the main passage. The water from Short Drop soon enters from the right, and a large collapse from Ash Tree Hole on the surface is passed on the left. The passage develops into a canyon, and drops down two well-watered shafts of and . The final one lands in a chamber with a sump pool, which is a window into the underwater passages carrying water from Notts Pot to the resurgence at Leck Beck Head. Upstream has been dived for to a shaft deep. At the bottom a descending passage chokes at a depth of , the deepest point in the Three Counties System. The main downstream has been dived past a junction at . Upstream here emerges at the downstream sump of Lost Johns' Cave after . Downstream has been dived for some , past an inlet from Pippikin Pot, to the resurgence, much of it at depth. A window in the upper part of the main passage leads into a series of well decorated chambers called Glasfurd's Chamber. Geology and hydrology The cave is a solutional cave formed in Visean Great Scar limestone from the Mississippian Series of the Carboniferous period. The various abandoned passages in Short Drop Cave show that it has a long history, but the current drainage flows through the main passages of Short Drop Cave and Gavel Pot to join the main Ireby Fell Cavern - Notts Pot water at the base of the cave, where it flows through to its resurgence at Leck Beck Head. The position and orientation of the main system is thought to have been influenced by a gentle syncline plunging towards the north-west, and the height of the development of Short Drop Cave has been influenced by a major inception horizon between the Lower Hawes and Goredale Limestones, identifiable by a thin bed of shale and sometimes coal. Glasfurd's Chamber is thought to be part of a major phreatic passage formed some 350,000 years ago, that took water from a major sink at Rumbling Hole, through Death's Head Hole and Glasfurd's Chamber, and hence to a resurgence in the Leck Beck valley some above the current resurgence which is now covered with glacial till. History The first recorded exploration of the Gavel Pot - Short Drop system was in 1885, when Messrs. W. Eckroyd, Geoffrey and Cuthbert Hastings descended one of the entrances in the Gavel Pot shakehole, and explored Short Drop Cave for a considerable distance upstream, using a ladder constructed out of iron piping and rope to scale the high waterfall. They referred to the cave as \\"Low Dowk Cave\\", seemingly under the impression it was Low Douk Cave near Marble Steps Pot. It was referred to as \\"Gavel-pot\\" in 1842 by Jonathan Otley, and in 1881 Balderstone referred to it as \\"Gavel or Navel Pot\\". Short Drop cave was explored through to Gavel Pot by a Yorkshire Ramblers' Club party in 1898. The University of Leeds Speleological Society undertook a major survey of the system in 1965, and pushed a lot of inlets and high level passages including Masochist Passage and the Ancient Highway and opening up Rift Entrance, to extend the cave to a length of . The Coal Hole entrance was explored to Short Drop in 1977 by the Cave Projects Group. The main passages in Gavel Pot were first explored in 1970, when the Northern Pennine Club excavated a shaft in the final chamber. The upstream terminal sump was originally dived by Dave Yeandle. Geoff Yeadon descended the sump to a depth of in 1974, and the shaft was finally bottomed in 1985 by Rob Palmer. The downstream underwater connection with Lost Johns' Cave was made by Bob Churcher in 1975, and with Pippikin Pot in 1989 by Geoff Yeadon.

Police harassment at California Hall On the eve of January 1, 1965, several homophile organizations in San Francisco, California - including the Council on Religion and the Homosexual, the Society for Individual Rights, the Daughters of Bilitis, and the Mattachine Society - held a fund-raising ball for their mutual benefit at the California Hall. Prior to the ball, several of the ministers from the Council on Religion and the Homosexual met with the San Francisco police, who tried to get them to cancel it. The clergy members declined to cancel the event, and the San Francisco police agreed not to interfere. However, on the evening of the ball, the police showed up in force and surrounded the California Hall and focused numerous kleig lights on the entrance to the hall. As each of the 600 plus persons entering the ball approached the entrance, the police took their photographs. A number of police vans were parked in plain view near the entrance to the ball. Evander Smith, a lawyer for the groups organizing the ball, and Herb Donaldson, another openly gay lawyer, tried to stop the police from conducting the fourth \\"inspection\\" of the evening; both were arrested, along with two heterosexual lawyers - Elliott Leighton and Nancy May - who were supporting the rights of the participants to gather at the ball. On January 2, 1965, ministers associated with the Council on Religion and the Homosexual held a news conference in protest of Smith, Donaldson, and the other two lawyers arrest as well as the police harassment that they ball attendees had been subjected to. Twenty-five of the most prominent lawyers in San Francisco joined the defense team for the four lawyers, and the judge directed the jury to find the four not-guilty before the defense had even had a chance to begin their argumentation when the case came to court. This event has been called the \\"San Francisco's Stonewall\\" by some historians; The participation of such prominent litigators in the defense of the Smith, Donaldson, and the other two lawyers marked a turning point in gay rights on the West Coast of the United States.

Cloud computing is a large-scale distributed computing model that is driven by economies of scale. It integrates a set of abstracted, virtualized, dynamically-scalable, and managed resources, such as computing power, storage, platforms, and services. External users can access to resources over the Internet using terminals, especially mobile terminals. Cloud architectures are developed in on-demand fashion. That is, the resources are dynamically assigned to a user according to his request, and relinquished after the job is done.Cloud computing and grid computing 360-degree compared. Yong Zhao , Raicu.

According to the level of its resources, cloud computing services can be divided into three categories, Infrastructure as a service (IaaS), Platform as a service (PaaS), and Software as a service (SaaS).A taxonomy and survey of cloud computing systems. Eunmi Choi , Lumb. I. INC, IMS and IDC, 2009. NCM '09. Fifth International Joint Conference on.  Potential Threats  While enjoying the convenience of cloud computing, network security risks cannot be ignored. A customer's data security relies on security service from cloud computing providers, however, current structure of cloud computing services are provided by independent operators. First, the user's information security provides commerce and management. Second, the information leakage can be caused by technology flows of providers. What's more, cloud computing is an open environment. Hence, any weakness will cause information security risks of the whole system.  Crypto Cloud Computing  Cloud computing is a combination of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS. To construct a secure cloud computing system, security at infrastructure, service platforms and application software levels have to be studied for a secure cloud computing system. Information encryption is one of effective means to achieve cloud computing information security. Traditionally, information encryption focuses on specified stages and operations, such as data encryption. For cloud computing, a system level design has to be implemented. Crypto cloud computing is a new secure cloud computing architecture. It can provide protection of information security at the system level, and allows users access to shared services conveniently and accurately. Crypto cloud computing protects individual's connections with the outside world. It can protect the personal privacy without any delay of information exchange. Crypto cloud computing is based on the Quantum Direct Key system. Quantum Direct Key (QDK) is a set of advanced asymmetric offline key mechanism. In this mechanism, all entities get public and private key pair according to their ID. Each entity only holds its own private key, but has a public key generator to generate any public key. In this system, an entity can produce the public key of any other entities offline, no any third-party agency (such as CA) is necessary. Crypto cloud computing based on QDK can avoid network traffic congestion, and other drawbacks using current encryption system. In the crypto cloud computing system, each entity encrypts data using his/her own private key. All elements in the system such as cloud computing infrastructure units, platform, virtualization tools and all involved entities have their own keys. While fulfilling their own functions of information exchange and processing, all these elements will use the public key and private key to perform authentication first. What's more, events occur in the cloud computing are also assigned a unique key. In this way, crypto cloud system guarantees the security and credibility of information exchange. Current cloud computing structure is developed for data and computing sharing. Security is not priority of system. On the contrary, encryption and security are inherently integrated in the crypto cloud computing based on the QDK. QDK authorized function units are bricks of crypto cloud computing. Besides primary function of data en/decryption, crypto cloud computing also provides many security related functions. For example, all channels sign transmit data using with their own keys, and the receiving terminals can avoid hijacking by verifying signature. What's more, the exact position of security leakage can be identified determined by analyzing digital signatures of forged data. Based on such capabilities, crypto-related functions can be provided as services in cloud, which is named as ‚ÄòCrypto as a service (CAAS)‚Äô. Crypto cloud computing is not only the advances in information technology, but also innovation of logical relationship. In crypto cloud computing system, non-system data is not allowed to store and transmit. Private Key and offline public key, play a role of identification and certification in the process of information exchange. In this way, the cloud establishes a relationship of trust with a customer. Data identification depends on the logical relationship of mutual trust or need, and the logical relationship depends on the cloud customer.  Importance of Crypto Cloud Computing  Crypto cloud computing is a new framework for cyber resource sharing. It protects data security and privacy. Well, in cloud environment, crypto cloud computing guarantees the information security and integrity during whole procedure. Security management of cloud computing can also be performed by authorizing the signatures of every element involved. What's more, a user can retrieve all related resources using his QDK key. There is no personal privacy under the current cloud framework, as pointed out by Mark Zuckerberg, 'the Age of Privacy Is Over '. However, with the development of crypto cloud computing, we can resolve the conflict between services data sharing and privacy security. It opens up new prospects for the development of information sharing technology. References [1] Cloud computing and grid computing 360-degree compared. Yong Zhao, Raicu. I, Lu.S.

Background Fort Larned is a bay horse with a small white star. He was bred in Kentucky by Janis Whitham, under whose colors he also raced. In 1988, Whitham and her late husband purchased the Argentinian mare Bayakoa and campaigned her in the United States, winning the Breeders' Cup Distaff in both 1989 and 1990. Twice named the American Champion Older Female Horse, Bayakoa was later inducted into the Hall of Fame. Bayakoa produced four foals for Whitham, including the mare Arlucea. In 2007, Arlucea was bred to E Dubai, a horse who won both the Dwyer Stakes and the Suburban Handicap for his owners Godolphin Racing. Apart from Fort Larned, his most successful runner has been the Breeders' Cup Turf Sprint winner Desert Code. Whitham, a native of Kansas, named the resultant colt after Fort Larned National Historic Site, located near Larned, Kansas. Fort Larned was trained by Ian Wilkes, who had been a long-time assistant trainer for Hall of Famer Carl Nafzger, who won the Kentucky Derby with both Unbridled and Street Sense. Racing career Fort Larned raced only once as a two-year-old, finishing fourth in a maiden special weight race at Churchill Downs on November 27, 2010. At age three, Fort Larned ran nine times, winning three of them. His first win came on January 8, 2011 at Gulfstream Park, after which he lost his next four starts. Wilkes decided to try the horse on the turf and Fort Larned responded by winning an allowance race on September 10 at Kentucky Downs. After two more losses on the turf, Fort Larned made his last start of the year at Churchill Downs on November 27 in an allowance race that had been switched from turf to the dirt course due to rain. He won by seven lengths, \\"turning a proverbial corner\\" on his way to becoming a top-ranked older horse. 2012: four-year-old season Fort Larned began his 2012 season in Florida with a loss in a handicap at Tampa Bay Downs followed by a win in the Challenger Stakes on March 3. He then recorded his first important success at Gulfstream Park on March 31, winning the Grade III Skip Away Stakes by two and a half lengths over Alma d'Oro while setting a track record of 1:53.92 for miles. Wilkes stated that the horse had made great improvement and it was suggested that he was well-suited by being allowed to \\"run free\\". At Churchill Downs in May he finished second in the Alysheba Stakes behind Successful Dan, with Mucho Macho Man in third. At the same course a month later he was moved into Grade I class and finished unplaced behind Ron the Greek in the Stephen Foster Handicap after being forced wide in the straight. In his next race, Fort Larned was ridden for the first time by Brian Hernandez, Jr.. At Prairie Meadows on June 30, he led from the start to record a three length success over Successful Dan and Awesome Gem in the Cornhusker Handicap. A first Grade I success followed in August in the Whitney Handicap at Saratoga Race Course. Racing in blinkers for the first time, he took the lead a quarter mile from the finish and won from Ron the Greek and Flat Out. \\"He's getting better all the time,\\" said Wilkes a few weeks after the race. \\"Mentally, he has a swagger about him. It's like he‚Äôs gone from a boy to a man. He has a presence about him now, a confidence.\\" Fort Larned's improving form saw him start the 3-1 favorite for the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park in late September. He moved up to challenge the leaders approaching the straight, then faded in the closing stages to finish third behind Flat Out and Stay Thirsty. \\"My horse ran good; we'll be fine, we'll go to the Breeders' Cup,\\" said Wilkes. \\"I wouldn't want to trade places. Blame got beat here before he beat Zenyatta (in the 2010 Breeders' Cup Classic). It doesn't pay to win this race to win the Breeders' Cup. You have to look at the bright side.\\" Fort Larned was sent to Santa Anita Park in November to contest the Breeders' Cup Classic, staying in the same barn that had housed his grand-dam Bayakoa. He started at odds of 9-1 in a twelve runner field with Game On Dude being made the 6-5 favorite. Hernandez sent the colt into the lead soon after the start and he was never headed. In the stretch he faced a strong challenge from Mucho Macho Man but stayed on to prevail by half a length, with a gap of six and a half lengths back to Flat Out in third. \\"I never thought the horse was that good,\\" said Whitham's son Clay, \\"because he was so slow developing. He was just a plain bay horse and nothing more. He wasn‚Äôt flashy at all. He finally grew up at Churchill Downs last November in the slop. When he won the Skip Away at Gulfstream this winter and set a track record, I finally thought, 'Hey, he‚Äôs got some talent.' But I sure wasn‚Äôt counting on winning this race.\\" Fort Larned was a finalist in the Eclipse Award voting for American Horse of the Year and Champion Older Male Horse, but lost both to Wise Dan, a turf specialist. In 2015, the Older Male Horse award became restricted to horses that run on the dirt. 2013: five-year-old season Fort Larned's first start since winning the Breeders' Cup came on March 9, 2013 at Gulfstream Park. He started favorite for the Gulfstream Park Handicap but lost his chance two strides after the start when he stumbled badly and unseated Hernandez. He injured his left front hoof but Wilkes felt lucky the injury was not worse. \\"The horse fell on his head,\\" he said. \\"He's lucky he didn't really hurt himself. He could have ripped his whole heel off or he could have broken his leg. The way he fell, his whole head hit the ground.\\" A month later he was made 1/2 favorite for the Oaklawn Handicap but ran poorly to finish fifth behind Cyber Secret, leading Wilkes to suggest that the horse had been unsuited by the fast track. After a break of two months, Fort Larned returned to contest the Stephen Foster Handicap. The horse led from the start and drew clear of his five opponents to win by six lengths from Golden Ticket and Ron the Greek in what was described as a \\"stunning display\\". The winning time of 1:47.45 was the second fastest in the history of the race, and just th of a second off the track record. \\"He ran unbelievable,\\" said winning trainer Ian Wilkes. \\"It was gratifying to get the horse back and to prove that he's as good as I thought he was and show he wasn't a one-year wonder.\\" On August 3 Fort Larned was made favorite for his second Whitney Handicap on August 3. Carrying top weight of 122 pounds he finished fifth of the eight runners behind Cross Traffic. Wilkes described his horse's performance as \\" a dull effort\\" but added, \\"We'll regroup. We'll be back.\\" Fort Larned was scheduled to make his next start in the Woodward Stakes but was scratched because he was not in top form. Eight weeks after his poor run in the Whitney, Fort Larned reappeared at Churchill Downs for the first running of the Homecoming Classic Stakes, which Wilkes had selected in preference to the Jockey Club Gold Cup. Hernandez sent the horse into the lead from the start and he was never headed, winning by one and a half lengths from Windswept in a time of 1:48.58. Fort Larned made his final start in the 2013 Breeders' Cup Classic, where he entered an early speed duel with Game On Dude and Moreno. The other two horses finished well back but Fort Larned held on to finish fourth behind Mucho Macho Man, the horse he had defeated in 2012. \\"It is emotional because it‚Äôs his last race,\\" said Wilkes. \\"He laid his body down today. My hat's off to Mucho Macho Man. He made a great comeback. I knew my horse would bring his 'A' game and he did. He definitely didn't disgrace himself. He put the two speed horses away and they aren't slouches.\\" Retirement Fort Larned retired to stud at Adena Springs Farm. As a horse with no trace of Northern Dancer or Seattle Slew in his own pedigree, he is expected to be a popular \\"outcross\\" for mares from these lines. His first foals will be of racing age in 2017.

Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol.2 p.208 and grew up in Dungar, now Frenchpark, County Roscommon. He was the second son of the wealthy landowner Colonel John French,Mosley, ed. Burkes' Peerage 107th Edition 2003 Vol.1 p.1056 who was nicknamed An Tiarna M√≥r (the Great Lord). Colonel French was the eldest son of Dominick French and his wife Anne King, daughter of John KIng and Sarah Conway, and granddaughter of Edward KIng, Bishop of Elphin. His mother was Anne Gore, daughter of Sir Arthur Gore, 1st Baronet and his wife Eleanor St. George. While his father's wealth and connections no doubt helped him in his career, he also owed much to his mother's family, in particular his uncle George Gore, justice of the Court of Common Pleas. Frenchpark, present day, winter He attended the local school in Roscommon, matriculated from the University of Dublin in 1708, took his degree of Bachelor of Arts in 1715 and was made Doctor of Law in 1730. He entered the Middle Temple in 1710 and was called to the Irish Bar in 1717. He sat in the Irish House of Commons as member for Jamestown, County Leitrim from 1727 to 1745.Ball p.208 In 1745 his uncle Mr Justice Gore announced that he would retire from the Court of Common Pleas (Ireland) on condition that French replace him. This put the Government in an awkward position; Gore, although he was not considered an especially good judge was personally very popular, whereas French was both a notoriously bad lawyer and personally a most unpopular individual.Ball p.137 However, since Gore was clearly unable to continue with his duties, the Crown reluctantly agreed to appoint French. French's conduct as a judge fully justified the official misgivings: an anonymous satire refers to \\"snarling, bridling, self-corroding French\\" and asked where his like for ignorance could be found.Ball p.140 He retired in 1761 and died in 1772.

He immigrated to Israel in 1926, and purchased 173 acres of orchards on the road from Tel Aviv to Petah Tikva, north of Bnei Brak. In the wake of the global economic crisis of 1929, parts of the orchards stopped being used, and as of October 1933 they were offered for sale as private building plots. In the second phase of the construction of the neighborhood, in November 1934, the name of the neighborhood is Tel Ephraim after Katz's son, Ephraim (Freddie) Katz. In July 1936 the health department of the Mandatory Palestine rented Katz's own orchard, and established the government Hospital for Infectious Diseases. Until 1947 were about 70 houses in the neighborhood. In its early years, Pardes Katz, was considered a prime location, due to the large open spaces in and around the orchards. At the beginning, the neighborhood was home to immigrants from Turkey, Yemen, Poland and Iraq. Further, many left the camp and were replaced by Maghrebi Jewish immigrants.

Hon‚Äôble the Chief Justice, vide order dated 1 November 1956 constituted temporary benches of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore and Gwalior. Later, by a Presidential Notification Dated 28 November 1968, issued in the exercise of the powers conferred by the Subsection (2) of section 51 of the States Reorganisation Act, 1956, permanent benches of the High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Indore and Gwalior were established. History In 1913, under Mandsaur Treaty, the Britishers established their existence in Indore through East India Company. The English, wherever they went, established their military, civil and health services as well as judicial system. Implementation of proceeding to impart justice to the people having transaction with the English and residing under their jurisdiction, was initiated at all levels. Till the end of 19th century, the portion of Indore city under jurisdiction of Britishers was known as cantonment. In the court of Resident, British law was applicable and District Judge of Khandwa in the British India used to come to exercise jurisdiction of High Court Judge in the cases of cantonment. In the rest of Indore under Holkars imparting justice went on as per old pattern by the jurists and petitions were finally decided in the Court of King. From the beginning of 20th Century administrative system of Holkar was highly influenced and the Britishers went on increasing their control over Malwa as advisers. From the beginning of 20th Century, officers of judiciary were being appointed according to advise of English and in Indore under the reign of Holkar, retired High Court Judges of British India were being appointed as Chief Justice. During this process, British law was adopted which prevailed as law made by Holkar. In 1931, extension of legal education started at Holkar College and thereafter study of law completely started in Indore. Prior to it, citizens of Indore had to go to pune, Bombay, Agra and Allahabad for obtaining degree of law. Formation In 1947, a new State known as Madhya Bharat came into existence in which Indore and other states were included and, capital and High Court both the places remained at Indore and Gwalior. On 26 January 1950, the Republic Day, constitutional High Court at Indore came into existence, and under the leadership of Hon'ble Justice Shri P.K. Kaul, the present system of High Court started at Indore. Justice Shri Kaul hailed from Allahabad High Court. Under his guidance it was decided that High Court should work at a different place. For it, the Government of Madhya Bharat obtained land from Maharaja Holkar for the present building on 22 March 1955. The President of India, Hon'ble Dr. Rajendra Prasad laid foundation stone of this building. Bench Conflict In 1956, State of Madhya Pradesh came into existence. That time, it was apprehended that the Bench of High Court at Indore might cease its existence, because Jabalpur was awarded with the High Court in lieu of capital. The then Chief Justice Hon'ble Shri Hidayatullah tried his best to keep High Court intact and only at a place. After Hon'ble late Justice P.K. Dixit became the Chief Justice, Bench at Indore resumed its lost dignity. During his tenure Indore Bench was declared a permanent bench by the President of India instead of being a bench established by the powers vested with the Chief Justice. In March 1959, Indore Bench was established in the present building, then the work started here with only 4 Judges. For the first time Hon'ble Shri Justice Newaskar, Hon'ble Shri Krishnan, Hon'ble Shri S.B. Sen and Hon'ble Shri Justice Razzaque were appointed. Territorial Jurisdiction The Indore High Court bench has the second largest jurisdiction area in state with 13 revenue districts which covers whole Malwa and Nimar region i.e. western Madhya Pradesh. The revenue districts includes Alirajpur District, Barwani District, Dewas District, Dhar District, Indore District, Jhabua District, Mandsaur District, Neemuch District, Ratlam District, Rajgarh District, Shajapur District, Ujjain District and Khargone District (West Nimar).

Plunkett's side later nearly pulled off a shock defeat of reigning Leinster champions Galway in the provincial semi-final. Laois's 2014 league campaign saw Plunkett's side preserve their position in Division 1B before narrowly losing to Clare at the quarter-final stage. For the second year in succession Laois nearly pulled off a shock victory over Galway, however, Plunkett's side eventually lost by two points. In 2015 Laois enjoyed a mixed league campaign but eventually survived in a relegation battle with Antrim. On 28 May 2015 Plunkett announced his resignation as manager after two of his panel members played a club game against the wishes of management. He later reversed his decision and returned as manager less than a week later. Personal life Plunkett's nickname is \\"Cheddar\\", which stems from his schooldays in Portlaoise.

Location The Mosque is in the district of Karatay of Greater Konya at about . It is situated in the business center of the city. History The original Mosque had been commissioned between 1671 and 1676Konya Index by Damat Mustafa Pasha who was the husband of Hatice Sultan, the daughter of sultan Mehmet IV. But when it was ruined as a result of a fire in 1867, it was recommissioned by Pertevniyal, the mother of sultan Abd√ºlaziz in 1874. (Name Aziziye refers to Abd√ºlaziz) Architecture The architectural style is a mixture of baroque and traditional Ottoman architecture. Nevertheless, it has many features which make it one of a kind. It is a double minaret building. In each minaret the ≈üerefe (balcony) roof is supported with columns which makes the mosque unique in Turkey. Unlike most other Mosques its main floor is elevated and stairs are used to reach the main floor. Also the floorspace is not wide and there is no yard. Because of the same reason Sadirvans (≈üadƒ±rvan, water fountains), are adjacent to minarets. The praying hall is square shaped and its ceiling is a big dome. The nartex has three smaller domes on six marble pillars. Another interesting feature of the Mosque is its windows which are wider than the doors. Building material The main building material is cut stone. Bluish marble has been used in the construction of mimber and mihrab.

In later life he became involved in charitable works, and was knighted in 1891. Biography Measom was born in Blackheath, Kent, the son of Daniel Measom, a carver and gilder. In 1842, he married Sarah Hillman. During the 1840s, he developed his skills as an engraver and in 1849 published The Bible: its Elevating Influence on Man, a moral tale in illustrated form. From the 1850s onwards much of Measom's work related to descriptions of railways; first railway work was the 1852 Illustrated Guide to the Great Western Railway. His railway works described the railways from the practical standpoint of a traveller, and all publications after the first took a title of the form The Official Illustrated Guide to ... . By 1867 his book covered the entire British network. Sarah died in 1867, after which he remarried to Charlotte Simpson. From the 1880s, Measom became involved in charity work, he was treasurer of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and promoted a related work that later became the Battersea Dogs' Home, and supported the Royal Marsden hospital. He was knighted in 1891, for his public work. George Measom died on 1 March 1901 at home, Isleworth, Middlesex. He left no children.

Although Ptolemy indicated that there were 19 \\"towns\\" in Caledonia, north of the Roman province of Britannia, no clear evidence of urban settlements has been found and these were probably hillforts. There is evidence of over 1,000 such forts, most below the Clyde- Forth line, but the majority seem to have been abandoned in the Roman period. There is also evidence of distinctive stone wheelhouses and small underground souterrains. From about 71 CE the Romans began military expeditions into what is now Scotland, building forts, like that at Trimontium, and probably pushing north as far as the River Tay where they created more fortifications, like those at Inchtuthil. These were soon abandoned, and the Romans settled for the occupation of the Southern Uplands by the end of the first century, below a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. This resulted in more fortifications and the building of Hadrian's Wall across what is now northern England. Around 141 CE they moved up to construct a new limes, a sward-covered wall made of turf known as the Antonine Wall, the largest Roman structure in modern Scotland. They soon retreated to Hadrian's Wall, with occasional expeditions that involved the building and reoccupation of forts, until the collapse of Roman power in the early fifth century. Caledonia wheelhouse on Grimsay Caledonia was the name that the Romans gave to the land north of their province of Britannia. In his Geographia, Ptolemy, possibly drawing on earlier sources of information as well as more contemporary accounts from the Agricolan invasion, identified 19 \\"towns\\" in Caledonia. No archaeological evidence of any truly urban places has been found from this time, and the names may have indicated hill forts, temporary markets or meeting places. Most of the names are obscure: Devana may be the modern Banchory, Alauna (meaning \\"the rock\\") in the west is probably Dumbarton Rock and the place of the same name in the east of the Lowlands may be the site of Edinburgh Castle. Lindon may be Balloch on Loch Lomond side.A. Moffat, Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History (London: Thames and Hudson, 2005), , pp. 268‚Äì70. There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, with a single palisade around an enclosure.J-D. G. G. Lepage, British Fortifications Through the Reign of Richard III: An Illustrated History (McFarland, 2012), , pp. 25 and 31. However, they appear to have been largely abandoned in the Roman period.A. Konstam, Strongholds of the Picts: The Fortifications of Dark Age Scotland (Botley: Osprey, 2010), , p. 12. There are also numerous vitrified forts, whose walls have been subjected to fire, which may date to this period, but an accurate chronology has not been created. Extensive studies of this type of fort at Finavon Hill near Forfar in Angus, suggest dates for the destruction of the site in either the last two centuries BCE, or the mid-first millennium CE.D. Alexander, \\"The oblong fort at Finavon, Angus\\" in B. B. Smith and I. Banks, eds, In the Shadow of the Brochs (Stroud: Tempus, 2002), , pp. 45‚Äì54. Many of these forts would be reoccupied after the Roman departure.A. Konstam, Strongholds of the Picts: The Fortifications of Dark Age Scotland (Botley: Osprey, 2010), , p. 12. Beyond the area of Roman occupation, in the west and north, there are over 60 sites identified of wheelhouses. Perhaps a development of earlier Atlantic roundhouses, these have a characteristic outer wall surrounding a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel).I. Crawford, \\"The wheelhouse\\" in B. B. Smith and I. Banks, eds, In the Shadow of the Brochs (Stroud: Tempus, 2002), , pp. 127‚Äì28. Over 400 souterrains, small underground constructions, have been discovered in Scotland, many of them in the south-east, and although few have been dated, those that have suggest a construction date in the second or third centuries CE. They are usually found close to settlements (whose timber frames are much less well-preserved) and may have been for storing perishable agricultural products.R. Miket, \\"The souterrains of Skye\\" in B. B. Smith and I. Banks, eds, In the Shadow of the Brochs (Stroud: Tempus, 2002), , pp. 77‚Äì110. Early Roman constructions The site of the fortress at Inchtuthil The Romans began military expeditions into what is now Scotland from about 71 CE. In 78 CE Gnaeus Julius Agricola arrived in Britain to take up his appointment as the new governor and began a series of major incursions. Two years later his legions constructed a substantial fort at Trimontium near Melrose. He is said to have pushed his armies to the estuary of the \\"River Taus\\" (usually assumed to be the River Tay) and established forts there, including a legionary fortress at Inchtuthil. After his victory over the northern tribes at Mons Graupius in 84 CE, a series of forts and towers were established along the Gask Ridge, which marked the boundary between the Lowland and Highland zones, probably forming the first Roman limes or frontier in Scotland. Agricola's successors were unable or unwilling to further subdue the far north. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion, and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge were abandoned within the space of a few years.A. Moffat, Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History (London: Thames and Hudson, 2005), , p. 245. By CE 87 the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands, and by the end of the first century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth.W. S. Hanson, \\"The Roman Presence: Brief Interludes\\", in K. J. Edwards, I. B. M. Ralston, eds, Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC ‚Äì AD 1000 (Edinburgh. Edinburgh University Press, 2003), , p. 195. Elginhaugh fort, in Midlothian, dates to about this period, as may Castle Greg in West Lothian. The Romans eventually withdrew to a line in what is now northern England, building the fortification known as Hadrian's Wall from coast to coast. The Antonine Wall and later invasions The locations of Hadrian's Wall and the Antonine Wall Around 141 CE the Romans undertook a reoccupation of southern Scotland, moving up to construct a new limes between the Firth of Forth and the Firth of Clyde. The resulting Antonine Wall is the largest Roman construction inside Scotland. It is a sward-covered wall made of turf, around high, with nineteen forts and extending for .\\"History\\", antoninewall.org, retrieved 25 July 2008.D. J. Breeze, The Antonine Wall (Edinburgh: John Donald, 2006), , p. 167. The stone foundations and wing walls of the original forts demonstrate that the intention was to build a stone wall similar to Hadrian's Wall, but this was quickly amended. There is a wide ditch on the north side, and a military way on the south. The Romans initially planned to build forts every , but this was soon revised to every . One of the best preserved forts, but also one of the smallest, is Rough Castle Fort. In addition to the forts, there are at least nine smaller fortlets, probably on Roman mile spacings, which formed part of the original scheme, some of which were later replaced by forts.L. Keppie, The Legacy of Rome: Scotland's Roman Remains (Edinburgh: John Donald, 1986), . The most visible fortlet is Kinneil, at the eastern end of the Wall, near Bo'ness.\\"The Antonine Wall\\", Scottish Heritage, retrieved 25 October 2013. Having taken twelve years to build, the wall was overrun and abandoned soon after CE 160. The Romans retreated to the line of Hadrian's Wall.A. Moffat, Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History (London: Thames and Hudson, 2005), , pp. 297‚Äì301. Roman troops penetrated far into the north of modern Scotland several more times, with at least four major campaigns. The Antonine Wall was occupied again for a brief period after 197 CE.A. S. Robertson, The Antonine Wall, Glasgow Archaeological Society (1960), p. 37. The most notable invasion was in 209 when the emperor Septimius Severus led a major campaign. A string of forts was constructed in the north-east (some of which may have been begun in the earlier Antonine campaign). These include camps associated with the Elsick Mounth, such as Normandykes, Ythan Wells, Deers Den and Glenmailen.C. M. Hogan, \\"Elsick Mounth ‚Äì Ancient Trackway in Scotland in Aberdeenshire\\" in The Megalithic Portal, ed. A. Burnham. Retrieved 24 July 2008. However, only two forts in Scotland, at Cramond and Carpow (in the Tay valley) are definitely known to have been permanently occupied during this incursion.W. S. Hanson, \\"The Roman Presence: Brief Interludes\\", in K. J. Edwards, I. B. M. Ralston, eds, Scotland After the Ice Age: Environment, Archaeology and History, 8000 BC ‚Äì AD 1000 (Edinburgh. Edinburgh University Press, 2003), , p. 198. There is evidence that these campaigns are coincident with the wholesale destruction and abandonment of souterrains in southern Scotland. This may have been due either to Roman military aggression or the collapse of local grain markets in the wake of Roman withdrawal.R. Miket, \\"The souterrains of Skye\\" in B. B. Smith and I. Banks, eds, In the Shadow of the Brochs (Stroud: Tempus, 2002), , pp. 82.

Stone Age settlers began to build in wood in what is now Scotland from at least 8,000 years ago. The first permanent houses of stone were constructed around 6,000 years ago, as at Knap of Howar, Orkney and settlements like Skara Brae. There are also large numbers of chambered tombs and cairns from this era, particularly in the west and north. In the south and east there are earthen barrows, often linked to timber monuments of which only remnants remain. Related structures include bank barrows, cursus monuments, mortuary enclosures and timber halls. From the Bronze Age there are fewer new buildings, but there is evidence of crannogs, roundhouses built on an artificial islands and of Clava cairns and the first hillforts. From the Iron Age there is evidence of substantial stone Atlantic roundhouses, which include broch towers, smaller duns. There is also evidence of about 1,000 hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. Stone Age Maes Howe, a passage grave on Orkney The oldest house for which there is evidence in Britain is the oval structure of wooden posts found at South Queensferry near the Firth of Forth, dating from the Mesolithic period, about 8240 BCE.R.

Moffat, Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History (London: Thames & Hudson, 2005), , pp. 90‚Äì1. With the development of agriculture, groups of settlers began building stone houses on what is now Scottish soil in the Neolithic era, around 6,000 years ago, and the first villages around 500 years later. Neolithic habitation, burial and ritual sites are particularly common and well-preserved in the Northern and Western Isles, where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.F. Pryor, Britain BC (London: HarperPerennial, 2003), , pp. 98‚Äì104 and 246‚Äì50. The stone building at Knap of Howar at Papa Westray, Orkney is one of the oldest surviving houses in north-west Europe, making use of locally gathered rubble in a dry-stone construction, it was probably occupied for 900 years, between 3700 and 2800 BCE.I. Maxwell, A History of Scotland‚Äôs Masonry Construction in P. Wilson, ed., Building with Scottish Stone (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), , p. 19. Skara Brae on the Mainland of Orkney also dates from this era, occupied from about 3100 to 2500 BCE and is Europe's most complete Neolithic village. There are also large numbers of chambered tombs and cairns from this period. Many different types have been identified, but they can be roughly grouped into passage graves, gallery graves and stone cists. Cists are relatively simple box-like graves, usually made up of stone slaps and covered with a large stone or slab.G. Noble, Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), , p. 113. Maes Howe, near Stenness on the mainland of Orkney (dated 3400‚Äì3200 BCE) and Monamore, Isle of Arran (dated approximately 3500 BCE) are passage graves, of megalith construction, built with large stones, many of which weigh several tons.F. Somerset Fry and P. Somerset Fry, The History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 1992), , p. 7. Gallery graves are rectangular gallery-like spaces, where the entrance at one end is the width of the gallery. These were sometimes lined or roofed with slabs and then covered with earth.F. Somerset Fry and P. Somerset Fry, The History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 1992), , p. 8. Among the most impressive surviving monuments of the period are the first sets of standing stones in Scotland, such as those at Stenness on the mainland of Orkney, which date from about 3100 BCE, of four stones, the tallest of which is in height.C. Wickham-Jones, Orkney: A Historical Guide (Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2007), , p. 28. The Callanish Stones, one of the finest stone circles in Scotland In contrast to the Highlands and Islands where stone was extensively used, in the south and east the most visible architectural survivals of the Neolithic are mainly earthen barrows, the earliest probably dating from the beginning of the fourth millennium BCE. Today these monuments consist of massive mounds of earth or stone, most commonly trapezoidal in plan and often orientated to the east. They are widely distributed in the Lowlands, particularly in Aberdeenshire, Angus, Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders.G. Noble, Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), , p. 71. Related structures include bank barrows, cursus monuments, mortuary enclosures, timber halls, and other forms of enclosure.G. Noble, Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), , p. 45. Bank barrows are parallel-sided mounds, usually flanked by ditches on either side. Originally believed to be Roman in origin, cursus monuments also consist of long parallel lengths of banks of earth with external ditches, but with an open avenue or enclose between. Both forms are usually associated with burial chambers.J. Pollard, Neolithic Britain (Osprey, 2008), , pp. 39‚Äì40. Examples of bank barrows in Scotland include from Perthshire the long mound at Auchenlaich and the hybrid bank barrow/cursus monument and at Cleaven Dyke, which stretches for over .R.

Mortuary enclosures are usually sub-rectangular banks with external ditches and raised platforms of stone or wood within them, thought by J. G. Scott to be used for the exposure of corpses prior to burial elsewhere, although this interpretation is disputed. Remains of mortuary enclosures of this period are often found under long barrows. Key examples include Pitnacree, Perthshire and two closely related sites at Lochhill and Slewcairn, both in Kirkcudbright.G. Noble, Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), , pp. 72‚Äì4. The timber halls are probably unique to Scotland and were massive roofed buildings made of oak, all of which seem to have been subsequently burnt down. There is debate as to the role of these buildings, which have been seen variously as regular farming homesteads of Neolithic families and as related to a series of monumental constructions such as barrows.G. Noble, Neolithic Scotland: Timber, Stone, Earth and Fire (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2006), , p. 17. The hall at Balbridie, Aberdeenshire was long, wide and may have had a roof high, making it large enough to accommodate up to 50 people.A.

Bronze Age Reconstructed crannog on Loch Tay As bronze working developed from about 2000 BCE, there was a decline in the building of large new structures, which, with a reduction of the total area under cultivation, suggests a fall in population.A.

From the Early and Middle Bronze Age there is evidence of cellular round houses of stone, as at Jarlshof and Sumburgh in Shetland.B. Cunliffe, Iron Age Communities in Britain: An Account of England, Scotland and Wales from the Seventh Century BC until the Roman Conquest (New York, NY: Routledge, 2004), , p. 60. At Jarlshof these are oval houses with thick stone walls, which may have been partly subterranean at the earliest period of inhabitation, a technique that provided both structural stability and insulation.I. Armit, Towers in the North: The Brochs of Scotland (Stroud: Tempus, 2003), , p. 28. There is also evidence of the occupation of crannogs, roundhouses partially or entirely built on an artificial islands, usually in lakes, rivers and estuarine waters.N. Dixon The Crannogs of Scotland: An Underwater Archaeology (Stroud: Tempus, 2004), . They were often constructed of layers of brushwood and rubble. Sometimes they were revetted around the edges with vertical piles and sometimes surfaced with logs of oak. The creation of cairns and Megalithic monuments continued into this period. There are approximately fifty Clava cairns in Scotland, named after those at Balnuaran of Clava near Inverness. They take two distinct forms, either a circular rubble enclosure known as \\"ring cairns\\", or passage graves, with a long entrance, usually in complex astronomical alignments.C.

As elsewhere in Europe, hill forts were first introduced in this period, including the occupation of Eildon hill near Melrose in the Scottish Borders, from around 1000 BCE, which accommodated several hundred houses on a fortified hilltop,A.

Iron Age The ruins of Dun Carloway Iron Age broch In the early Iron Age, from the seventh century BCE, cellular houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles by simple Atlantic roundhouses, substantial circular buildings with a drystone construction. Important examples are at Quanterness, Bu, Pierowall, and Tofts Ness on Orkney, and at Clickimin in Shetland. From about 400 BC more complex Atlantic roundhouses began to be built, as at Howe, Orkney and Crosskirk, Caithness.B. Cunliffe, Iron Age Communities in Britain: An Account of England, Scotland and Wales from the Seventh Century BC until the Roman Conquest (New York, NY: Routledge, 2004), , p. 325. The most massive constructions that date from this era are the circular broch towers, probably dating from about 200 BCE. They are drystone hollow-walled structures that are unique to Scotland. Most ruins only survive up to a few metres above ground level, although there are five extant examples of towers whose walls still exceed in height.I. Armit, Towers in the North: The Brochs of Scotland (Stroud: Tempus, 2003), , p. 55. There are at least 100 broch sites in Scotland, of which the best preserved include those at South Yarrows near Wick, Midhowe Broch on Orkney and the Broch of Clickimin and the Broch of Mousa in Shetland.I.

Despite extensive research, their purpose and the nature of the societies that created them are still a matter of debate.B. Smith and I. Banks, In the Shadow of the Brochs (Stroud: Tempus, 2002), , p. 218. Archaeologists since the 1960s have distinguished brochs from smaller structures of similar construction, usually called duns.B.

This period also saw the beginnings of wheelhouses, a roundhouse with a characteristic outer wall, within which was a circle of stone piers (bearing a resemblance to the spokes of a wheel), but these would flourish most in the era of Roman occupation.V. Turner, Ancient Shetland (London: B. T. Batsford/Historic Scotland, 1999), , p. 81. There is evidence for about 1,000 Iron Age hillforts in Scotland, most located below the Clyde-Forth line. The majority are circular, with a single palisade around an enclosure. Most are relatively small, covering one or two acres, but some are much larger as at Castle O'er, Birrenwark, Cadimuir, Cadroner and White Meldon.J-D. G. G. Lepage, British Fortifications Through the Reign of Richard III: An Illustrated History (McFarland, 2012), , pp. 25 and 31.

It was established on December 2, 2009 at the 64th session of the United Nations General Assembly by the resolution 64/35, which was adopted unanimously. The resolution in particular calls for increasing awareness \\"about the effects of nuclear weapon test explosions or any other nuclear explosions and the need for their cessation as one of the means of achieving the goal of a nuclear- weapon-free world\\". The resolution was initiated by Kazakhstan together with several sponsors and cosponsors to commemorate the closure of the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site on August 29, 1991. Following the establishment of the International Day against Nuclear Tests, in May 2010 all state parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons committed themselves to \\"achieve the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons\\". Conferences On September 15, 2014 the Embassy of Kazakhstan in the United States in co-sponsorship with Arms Control Association, Green Cross International, the Embassy of Canada, and the ATOM Project held a conference \\"Nuclear Weapons Testing: History, Progress, Challenges\\" commemorating United Nations International Day Against Nuclear Tests. The conference took place at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, D.C. This conference was focused on the issue of nuclear weapons testing and the road forward for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. The keynote presenters included the U.S. Secretary of Energy Ernest J. Moniz, the U.S. Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security Rose E. Gottemoeller, the U.S. Under Secretary of Energy and NNSA Administrator Frank J. Klotz, and the Executive Secretary of CTBTO Lassina Zerbo. The participants of the conference underlined their commitment to the nuclear weapons non- proliferation. In popular culture * NationStates, a popular multiplayer government simulation browser game, celebrates the International Day against Nuclear Tests in a surprising way. On August 29th of every year, nations are granted the ability to use nuclear weapons against each other, leading to a violent multifaceted nuclear war.

He was the father of the N√πng/Zhuang chieftain Nong Zhigao, who revolted against Annamese rule in 1048, established the Kingdom of Changsheng, and besieged Guangzhou for two months in 1052. Biography Nong Quanfu was a son of Nong Minfu (ÂÑÇÊ∞ëÂØå), a local chieftain of Guangyuan. Nong Minfu received the titles minister of works (Âè∏Á©∫) and grand master of splendid happiness bearing the golden pocket with purple trimming (ÈáëÁ¥´ÂÖâÁ•øÂ§ßÂ§´) from the Song court, which he eventually passed on to his son, Nong Quanfu. Nong Quanfu was then granted the additional authority to rule Thang Do prefecture in the southeastern corner of the present-day Jingxi county, in Guangxi. His younger brother and brother-in-law controlled two other nearby prefectures. Quanfu's home prefecture was a great source of gold, which together with his domination over local trade route along the Bang river must have largely increased his wealth and political influence. Around 1020, Nong Quanfu married A Nong, a shamaness and the daughter of a noted chieftain of the Nong clan. Later, A Nong became his primary political advisor. Under A Nong's instruction, Quanfu killed his brother who was a leader in the Cen (Â≤ë) clan and took his land.http://freepages.family.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~chinesesurname/s067.htmlJeffrey G. Barlow (1987:256) writes that Nong Quanfu first killed his own brother, then a leader of the Cen clan, and took their lands. Nung/Zhuang chieftains allocated lands to followers in a true feudal system, with some attributes of slave-holding practices. The amount of land controlled by a chieftain affected the number of men he could field, a powerful incentive to expansive warfare. The Nong clan eventually controlled 14 majors dongs, compared to 5 claimed by the Huang clan. Quanfu found the Kingdom of Longevity (Èï∑ÁîüÂúã) and took for himself the exalted title Luminous and Sage Emperor (Êò≠ËÅñÁöáÂ∏ù). He gave his wife A Nong the title Enlightened and Virtuous Empress (ÊòéÂæ∑ÁöáÂêé). Quanfu then broke off all ties with Annamese ruler Ly Phat Ma, but was finally captured and executed by the Annamese ruler in 1039.

Background  Lady Ma was born in 890, during the reign of Emperor Zhaozong of Tang. Her father Ma Chuo was an officer serving under Qian Liu, a warlord who then controlled the region around Hang Prefecture (Êù≠Â∑û, in modern Hangzhou, Zhejiang), who would eventually found Wuyue as King Wusu. (She was said to be from Anguo County (ÂÆâÂúã), which might have been referring to Qian Liu's hometown Yijin Base (Ë°£Èå¶Ëªç, in modern Hangzhou), as it was also known as Anguo Yijin Base.) Ma Chuo was, either by familial relations or by personal relations, was very close to Qian, as, because of those relations, he married one of Qian's younger sisters. At some point, Qian also took Lady Ma to be the wife of his son Qian Chuanguan. (Qian Chuanguan had been forced to marry the daughter of another late-Tang warlord, Tian Jun the military governor of Ningguo Circuit (ÂØßÂúã, headquartered in modern Xuancheng, Anhui) as a political marriage and was taken to Ningguo, in 902,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 263. and was not able to return to Qian Liu's domain until Tian's downfall in 903,Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 264. so his marriage to Lady Ma would have come after.)  Marriage to Qian Yuanguan  As Qian Chuanguan's wife, Lady Ma was said to be intelligent, wise, and diligent. During Qian Liu's reign, he banned officials from having concubines. As Qian Chuanguan and Lady Ma did not have any sons even past the age of 30, Lady Ma became concerned. She went to her father-in-law Qian Liu to ask for an exemption on Qian Chuanguan's behalf. Qian Liu responded to her happily, \\"My family's future bloodline is in your hands.\\" He thus allowed Qian Chuanguan to have concubines, and they bore him a large number of sons, whom Lady Ma treated as her own sons. She had a silver deer made and placed before her seat, and was accustomed to happily watch the children play on and around it.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 282. Over the years, apparently after Qian Chuanguan succeeded Qian Liu upon Qian Liu's death in 932 (at which time he changed his name to Qian Yuanguan),Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. Lady Ma received titles from the emperors of Later Tang and the subsequent Later Jin, whom Qian Yuanguan was formally a vassal to. She was initially created the Lady of Yue, and later Lady Zhuangmu of Wuyue. She died in 939, while Qian Yuanguan was still king, and was posthumously honored by Emperor Gaozu of Later Jin as Lady Gongmu (\\"respectful and solemn\\").

It is used for stationery, leaflets, posters, books, magazines, bags, packaging, wallpaper, adhesives, tags, in-mould labels, plates, trays, containers, and maps among other uses. Production Stone paper consists of 3 components : calcium carbonate, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and usually a proprietary coating developed by the individual supplier. High density polyethylene is a non-toxic resin. The proprietary coating serves to enhance printing quality and performance for applications in printing papers. Properties Stone paper has a density range of 1.0-1.6g/cm3, which is equal to, or slightly higher than, ordinary paper and a texture somewhat like that of the outer membrane of a boiled egg. It may be recycled with Number 2 plastics or remade into rich mineral paper again, and is not biodegradable but is photo- degradable under suitable conditions.Chu and Nel, \\"Characterisation and deterioration of stone papers\\", AICCM Bulletin, vol 40.1, 2019 Because it is not made from wood fibers, stone paper possesses a smoother surface than most traditional paper products, eliminating the need for a coating or lamination. The source of the calcium carbonate is waste material collected from marble quarries and offcuts which are ground and reduced to fine white calcium carbonate powder. The production of stone paper uses no water, acid, bleach or optical brighteners.

Sustainability Comparisons have been made between stone paper and traditional paper for applications like book printing in Europe. If stone paper were to replace coated and uncoated graphic printing stock in Europe, it could potentially reduce the according CO2 generation by 62%, water consumption by 99.2%, and wood usage by 100%. These results depend however on the type of calcium carbonate used for stone paper and the source of the HDPE. The ratio of oil required to make virgin HDPE for stone paper is such that large scale replacement of traditional paper could save 46% of oil consumption from the current European graphic paper supply with virgin and recycled components.

The use off pre-eruption guidance appliances and the timing of extractions of certain deciduous teeth aligns the teeth naturally as opposed to orthodontic mechanical movement of permanent teeth into alignment after they have erupted. Research shows that pre-eruption guidance produces far more stable tooth alignment than alternative treatments.American Journal of Orthodontics and DentoFacial Orthopedics \\"Preventive Treatment of Ectopically Erupting Maxillary Permanent Canines by Extraction of Deciduous Canines and First Molars: A Randomized Clinical Trial\\" March 2011. http://www.ajodo.org/article/S0889-5406(10)00764-X/abstract As defined by the American Dental Association and The American Association of Orthodontists, pre-eruption guidance therapy is a treatment method instituted with the use of bimaxillary bilateral removable space maintainers and the removal of the maxillary right and left deciduous cuspids [baby teeth] at very specific times to allow for a more optimal eruption pattern for permanent teeth to enter the mouth.American Dental Association's Current Dental Terminology User's Manuel, 2012 Edition as CODE 8060 (Appendix 1), ‚ÄúInterceptive Orthodontic Treatment of the Transitional Dentition.‚Äù http://www.dhhs.nh.gov/ombp/medicaid/children/documents/dpm.pdf An integral part of the success of this treatment is the timely removal of certain deciduous teeth. Pre-eruption guidance is distinctive because unlike other approaches, a patients' treatment results are achieved physiologically through muscle movements and removable functional spacer maintainers.The guidance of Eruption Without Extraction: http://ejo.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/suppl_1/i107.full instead of mechanically through dental braces. This alleviates the need for braces to mechanically align or essentially repair the effects of mature teeth that erupted misaligned and crowded.Orthodontic braces This form of early, interceptive orthodontic treatment can be started on certain types of tooth problems before all teeth have erupted. Pre-eruption guidance treatment is usually begun after the four permanent upper and lower front teeth have erupted (approximately age seven).http://dentistry.hsc.wvu.edu/Orthodontics/MediaLibraries/Dentistry- Orthodontics/Media/early-treatments-pubs/Guidance-of-eruption-for-general- practitioners.pdf The goal of this treatment for a child of that age is to normalize and naturalize the dentition and then to allow the daily use of durable orthodontic retainers and the patient's natural muscle development to guide future erupting teeth into an optimal position in the mouth over time. In some cases a second phase of treatment is necessary. This additional phase is significantly shorter and can be completed by the time patients who are not undergoing pre-eruption guidance are first beginning their treatments. Cases in which the pre-eruption guidance process would be beneficial include improvement of dental alignment and correction of a functional occlusion (severe deep bite, severe overjet, constricted maxillary width, blocked out maxillary cuspids, lower crowding).Dentofacial Changes after Orthodontic Intervention with Eruption Guidance Appliance in the Early Mixed Dentition: http://www.angle.org/doi/abs/10.2319/012607-37.1 One benefit of the pre- eruption guidance approach is not having to surgically remove any of the patient's permanent teeth. Additionally, patients undergoing pre-eruption guidance therapy often do not require a later phase of treatment involving application of fixed braces or permanent tooth extractions performed by an oral surgeon. This preventive treatment process may ensure a patient's teeth will erupt in a more ideal position and maintain their erupted position for the rest of the patients life.Treatment stability with the eruption guidance appliance. http://uningateresina.com.br/Dimon/Arquivos/Artigos/13279707934f2739e9e14b6.pdf However, like any orthodontic treatment, it is heavily dependent on the patients cooperation and support to succeed. Due to the method's reliance on achieving results working with the patient's own physiology to align their teeth, practitioners help the patients achieve proper alignment for minimal cost. Patients may also avoid more expensive, later staged treatments involving permanent tooth extractions, longer time with fixed appliances, and additional visits to the orthodontist.

It is similar in concept to a passing loop but is connected to the main line at only one end, rather than both ends.

They are mostly used by stopping passenger trains and freight trains, especially in cases where express trains are scheduled to pass. Sometimes refuge sidings were needed where there were steep ramps on the line. For example, at Gresford railway station in Australia, the gradient was so steep that a refuge siding was required at the station in case some of the wagons or coaches of a train had to be left behind so that it could climb the hill. In British and Australian practice at least, it was common to refer to such sidings as an \\"Up refuge siding\\" or \\"Down refuge siding\\" depending on the orientation of the siding in relation to the direction of travel.

It has been designed specifically as a pioneering care facility for elderly people with dementia. The benefit of using all-day reminiscence therapy at Hogewey, compared to traditional nursing homes, is that the residents with dementia are more active and require less medication. The setting has been compared to that depicted in the film The Truman Show. Carers, doctors and nurses work around the clock to provide the 152 residents the necessary 24-hour care. Layout The Hogewey complex is set out like a village with a town square, supermarket, hairdressing salon, theatre, pub, caf√©-restaurant‚Äîas well as the twenty-three houses themselves. In 2018 4 houses were added to The Hogeweyk. Each house reflects a style that is common to, and familiar for, the six or seven people who live in that house. The seven settings provided are * ', for those used to living in an urban area * ', with an aristocratic Dutch feel * ' for those used to working as trades people or craftsmen/women * ' for those with an association with Indonesia and the former Dutch East Indies * ' for homemakers * ' for those brought up with theatre and cinema * ' for those with a central religious aspect to life, whether Christian or another religion. The doctors, nurses and carers aim to make the experience as real as possible to the residents. Residents shop at the supermarket and assist with preparing and cooking as they would at home. The carers wear normal daytime clothing rather than clinical clothing and fit into a role that the dementia sufferers are likely to be comfortable with; in the working class households the carers are seen to be neighbours or carers, while in the aristocratic/upper class setting, the nurses act akin to servants. The living styles have different types of music playing, significantly varied interior design, food and methods of table setting. Residents in each house have their own large bedroom and meet with other residents to share the living room, kitchen and dining room. The village employs 250 staff. There is no \\"fake reality\\" (hyperreality). The institute has made place for normality and highly trained staff support the residents. If residents are confused they have various methods to make them feel at ease (bv. Reality therapy (RT)Reality therapy. At the same time, the staff will not deceive the patients if directly asked, truthfully stating that the residents are in a place where they can receive required care for their condition. Because of the nature of Alzheimer's disease and dementia, the residents can remember the distant past but not the present, so even truthful answers given by the staff will be forgotten quickly. History The first ideas for the village came about in 1992, when the management team (including Yvonne van Amerongen, Jannette Spiering, e.o) at the traditional nursing home Hogewey after discussing that if their parents became affected by Alzheimers in the future they would not want them to endure hospital-like care. After a series of research and brainstorming sessions in 1993, the outcome was that normality should prevail in all kind of aspect of nursing home care. This vision was called \\"normalized small scale living for people with dementia\\". One of the aspects was that they decided that people generally prefer to surround and interact with other like- minded people of similar backgrounds and experiences. The arrangement at Hogewey provides this by ensuring that residents with similar backgrounds, norms and values continue to live closely together. The Hogeweyk facility was designed by architects Molenaar&Bol;&VanDillen;, and opened in December 2009 on four acres of land. It consists of low two-story brick buildings, and amenities such as a supermarket and theatre. Construction of the new Hogeweyk facilities cost ‚Ç¨19.3 million and was funded primarily by the Dutch government providing ‚Ç¨17.8 million, plus ‚Ç¨1.5 million in funding and sponsorship from local organisations. The caf√©‚Äìrestaurant is also open to the public and the theatre is hired by local businesses, both of which help with running costs. The cost per resident is similar to more traditional nursing homes at around ‚Ç¨5,000 per month. Amerongen was Hogeweys manager on Quality & Innovation at Vivium‚Äîthe government-owned company that runs Hogewey. Jannette Spiering became director in 2001 and commissioned the build of The Hogeweyk Because of the amount of foreign interest and foreign visitors, The business unit Be, The Hogeweyk care concept was created. Yvonne and Jannette are still active as senior consultants.

It has a seating capacity of 4,550 seats reserved to local fans, and a section of 50 seats reserved for the away fans. The arena was opened in 1968. It is home to Pallacanestro Reggiana basketball team, and Volley Tricolore volleyball team. History The construction of the arena started during the late 1960s, thanks to the efforts of municipal delegate Giulio Bigi, who wanted to build a big sports arena in the city, due to the large interest in sports. La Torre volleyball and basketball teams were competing in the First Divisions, with the female volleyball section winning four consecutive national championships, between 1964 and 1968, in the old small sports gym \\"GIL\\". PalaBigi was completed in December 1967, with the first competitive game held in it in 1968. The original capacity was near to 5,000, due to the terraces conformation of the stands in the 1960s and in the 1970s, and it was only later reduced to 3,000 because of the new arena laws introduced by the Italian Parliament. PalaBigi hosted the senior men's Italian national basketball team in 1999, where the Azzurri beat France, and the Italian national men's volleyball team the same year, where they beat Russia, 3‚Äì2.

Description The painting shows a fairly conventional depiction of this very common scene, with some unusual details. The number of shepherds is rather large at nine, and the pose of the shepherd pointing at the baby Jesus while looking over his shoulder outside the picture space suggests that more are arriving. Or possibly he has seen the approaching Magi, the next arrivals in the traditional narrative. Saint Joseph, often a rather superfluous figure in paintings of the Nativity, is shown making himself useful by carrying hay, presumably to feed the ox and ass, in the background, so filling a gap in the composition, and perhaps distracting them from joining in with the bagpipe music. The relegation of the ox and ass to a dimly-lit background is typical of 17th century compositions.Schiller, I, 88 A prominently placed shepherd on the left side of the group is shown playing his bagpipes. Though the shepherds sometimes carry musical instruments, often including pipes (see gallery below), they are less often shown playing them at this solemn moment, as opposed to the earlier scene of the Annunciation to the Shepherds where an angel appears to them with their flocks.Earls, Irene, Renaissance Art: A topical dictionary, Greenwood Publishing Group, 1987, , p. 18. If music is shown being performed beside the crib it is more often by angels. A charming but atypical miniature in the 15th-century Flemish La Flora Hours in Naples shows a shepherd playing his bagpipes as his two companions dance for the infant Jesus and a delighted Virgin Mary sits to one side.Kren & McKendrick, 331 (illustrated) Outside his painting, Domeninchino had a serious interest in musical instruments and their design, which his paintings sometimes reflect. He designed and himself constructed instruments intended to be suitable for playing ancient music.Cropper, S.3 The Giovanni Lanfranco Adoration at Alnwick Castle, 1607‚Äì08 The inclusion of the shepherd's dog, especially right by the crib, is unusual,It is not in the print of the work, perhaps because this was done from a drawing before it had been added. Brigstocke, 58 though the shepherds very often have one in scenes of their annunciation, and sometimes bring a lamb to the crib as a gift; here the dove held by the boy in the foreground is intended to represent a gift.Schiller, I, 87 In the 17th century the shepherds often crowd round the crib, as here, and Mary actively displays her child to them. However her gesture of lifting a cloth, revealing a full view of a naked Jesus, including his penis, is unusual in art by this date. In the late medieval period pictures of the infant Jesus often made a point of displaying his genitals for theological reasons,An influential book by Leo Steinberg, The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion (1983, 2nd edition 1996), explores the explicit depiction of Christ's penis in art, which he argues became a new focus of attention in late medieval art, initially covered only by a transparent veil in the early 14th century, and by the second half of the century completely uncovered, and often being the subject of the gaze or gestures of other figures in the scene. This emphasis is, among other things, a demonstration of Christ's humanity when it appears in depictions of the Madonna and Child and other scenes of Christ's childhood, and also a foreshadowing of Christ's Passion to come in the context of the Circumcision. See Kendrick, 11‚Äì15 but in the Counter-Reformation this was discouraged by clerical interpreters of the vague decrees on art of the Council of Trent, such as Saint Charles Borromeo. Carracci model The 17th- century art historian Gian Pietro Bellori makes the first mention of this work and describes it as a copy of a lost work by Annibale Carracci. Domenichino had been trained in Bologna by Annibale's brother Ludovico Carracci, and after moving to Rome in 1602 joined the circle of Annibale, who had already made the move there around the time Domenichino began to work with Ludovico. At this relatively early period in his career Domenichino copied several works by Annibale, and Bellori's statement has been generally accepted. However it seems that Bellori probably never saw the Carracci original, and no certain documentation for its subsequent history has been found. There is evidence bearing on the development of the composition in the form of a number of drawings by both Annibale and Domenichino, and two paintings by Giovanni Lanfranco, another young artist in the circle, that are based on the lost Carracci (one known only from a further copy).Brigstocke, 57‚Äì59 There has been a good deal of academic discussion on the matter, without a clear consensus being found as to how close Domenichino's composition is to the lost Carracci. The main Lanfranco, now at Alnwick Castle, is clearly related to the Domenichino, but has substantial differences, being in a horizontal format and with none of the poses of the figures exactly the same, and several substantially different.Brigstocke, 57‚Äì59; the Alnwick Lanfranco, Bridgeman Art Library The possibility remains that Bellori was \\"slightly mistaken\\" and that the phantom Carracci Adoration was never painted and that Domenichino was only working from drawings by Carracci, who painted little after a serious illness in 1605, but did produce an etching of this subject in about 1606.Brigstocke, 58; the etching is Bartsch XVIII, 2 Most of the large collection of workshop drawings left by Domenichino passed through the Albani Collection before ending up in the British Royal Collection, bought for George III; there are over 1,750 sheets at Windsor Castle today.Whitaker and Clayton, 328 These include a sheet with studies of the Edinburgh figures of Joseph on one side and the bagpiper on the other. Drawings can be regarded by different scholars as either copies of something already existing, sketches where an artist works out something new, or adaptations that are something in between, and this ambiguity has affected discussion of this question. Hugh Brigstocke, in the National Gallery of Scotland catalogue, sees this sheet as studies by Domenichino for new figures for his version of Carracci's composition, after Domenichino decided to add the bagpiper to strengthen the composition, necessitating a new position for Joseph.Brigstocke, 57‚Äì59, the drawing is catalogued as Windsor 5700 Other details, such as the boy with the dove, borrow from other drawings by Annibale Carracci.Brigstocke, 57 and figure 14, in this case from another drawing at Windsor (2083 verso). History The history of the painting before 1813 is unclear, and complicated by possible confusion with the lost model by Annibale Carracci. There is an engraving of the painting, described as being by Domenichino, which however omits certain details, suggesting it was made from a preparatory drawing also lacking these.The details are the ass, the dog, and the shepherd's crook lying on the foreground. Brigstocke, 57 Domenichino is mentioned by Bellori and described as a copy of a Carracci, which Bellori probably had never seen and did not know the whereabouts of. Bellori, in his book of artists' biographies published in 1672, said the Domenichino had recently left Rome for France. A Nativity attributed to Annibale Carracci, which might be either the original or the copy, is recorded by Andr√© F√©libien as being in the large collection of Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619‚Äì83), the famous finance minister of Louis XIV. According to Pierre-Jean Mariette the picture in the engraving belonged to the Orleans Collection, although it does not seem to appear in any of the inventories. This collection had received a significant addition from Colbert's heir Jean-Baptiste Colbert, Marquis de Seignelay. Most of the paintings of the Orleans Collection were taken to London and dispersed during the French Revolution, but again this painting is not identifiable among the records of the sales and other transactions recording this process. The painting's history is certain after it appears in a list of 1813 of the paintings bequeathed to the College of God's Gift, the charity owning Dulwich College, a school in the London suburbs, by Sir Francis Bourgeois in 1811. It was described as by Annibale Carracci here, and only finally confirmed as a Domenichino in 1906‚Äì7 by Hans Tietze, an attribution since accepted by all writers.Brigstocke, 57 The Dulwich Picture Gallery was founded to hold the Bourgeois bequest and other artworks owned by the charity, and the painting hung there until it was controversially sold by the trustees in 1971. It was sold at auction for ¬£100,000 by Sotheby's London on 24 March 1971, and bought by the National Gallery of Scotland.Brigstocke, 59; Dulwich Press Release , repeated on artdaily.org. For auction price see The sale was the subject of an adjournment debate in the House of Commons on May 13, 1971, where both the trustees and the minister whose consent had been necessary for the sale to occur were criticised by George Strauss M.P., especially for only publicising the sale three weeks before the auction.Hansard, Domenichino Picture (Sale) For a month over Christmas and New Year 2011/12 the painting returned to Dulwich as part of the celebrations for the gallery's bicentenary.artdaily.org The picture is in good condition, but the blues in the robes of the Virgin and the shepherd standing at right, as well as the yellow of the boy holding the dove, have \\"been affected by chemical change\\".Brigstocke, 56‚Äì57 Gallery A number of paintings from the 1530s and 1540s show a shepherd with bagpipes inflated, and the chanter pipe being fingered, but the mouthpiece not actually being blown.

The new 94-mile (152 km) line was built to shorten the distance between the Texas towns of Nelleva, a small community on the north side of Navasota, and Mexia. E.H. Harriman, who controlled the Union Pacific and the Southern Pacific spearheaded construction of the cutoff. Both Mexia and Nelleva were on the existing Houston and Texas Central Railroad (H&TC;) between Houston and Dallas via Hearn. The new cutoff would shorten the existing route by about 15 miles (24 km) with lower grades and fewer curves. Portions of the route of the Mexia-Nelleva Cutoff would be immediately adjacent to B. F. Yoakum's line, the Gulf Coast Lines, part of a collection of routes planned to link south Texas with New Orleans. (Yoakum also controlled the St. Louis-San Francisco Railroad (the \\"Frisco\\") and the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad. Both were major midwestern systems with rails reaching into north Texas from Oklahoma.) The 94-mile cutoff was completed in 1907 in time to compete with Yoakum's new Trinity and Brazos Valley Railway (T&BV;) line, which Yoakum had gained control of in 1904. Over the years, Yoakum's line flourished due primarily to the connecting traffic provided by the other railroads Yoakum controlled. Eventually, Yoakum lost control of these railroads and the T&BV;'s traffic suffered; the line went into a 16-year receivership from which it emerged in 1930 controlled by a partnership of the Rock Island and the Burlington System. Today, it is the BNSF main line between Waxahachie and Houston. By contrast, Harriman's Mexia- Nelleva Cutoff had virtually no local traffic provided by the small communities on the line. And while it was faster than the H&TC; line via Hearne for through trains, the marginal increase in speed was insufficient to cover the costs of maintaining an additional route between the two endpoints. In the end, it may have been SP's competition with the Texas & Pacific Railroad between Texarkana and El Paso that finally doomed the Mexia-Nelleva Cutoff. The T&P; could carry transcontinental traffic directly across Texas and interchange it with the SP in El Paso. This service competed favorably with SP's much longer route across Texas that required a connection with the Sunset Route at Houston. To improve the situation, SP opened the Dalsa Cutoff in 1914 between Hearne and Flatonia, shortening the route across Texas by 140 miles (226 km). Through freights that might previously have been routed via the Mexia-Nelleva Cutoff and the Sunset Route connecting at Houston could now bypass Houston, Texas altogether. With stiff competition from the T&BV; for the Gulf coast traffic, a diversion of transcontinental freight traffic to the Dalsa Cutoff, and virtually no local traffic, the Mexia-Nelleva Cutoff was doomed; it was finally abandoned in 1933. Of the 94 mile route between Mexia and Nelleva, approximately 80 miles (129 km) of it has been preserved as a transportation corridor in one form or another. Most of this is part of Farm Road 39, which is constructed atop the old right-of-way between Iola and Mexia, a distance of roughly 71 miles (114 km). A one mile section of Farm Road 3090 near the community of Piedmont is built on the right-of-way as is a three mile Grimes County gravel road near the community of Carlos (at the intersection of State Highway 30 and Farm Road 244). In 1977, five miles of the original cutoff route was rebuilt as a rail spur to serve the Texas Municipal Power Agency's Gibbons Creek Generating Plant south of Iola in Grimes County. The spur connects to the BNSF line that was formerly the rival T&BV; line. In 1995 and 1996, an extension to the rail spur was constructed to allow the unloading of coal at the power plant. This extension included a rail loop which was all within the existing plant boundary; a portion of this extension also followed the bed of the old rail line. South of the power plant, the grade serves as a gravel road leading north and south out of Carlos. It can be seen again along FM 3090, near the old community of Piedmont. Except for the brief section of FM3090 built on the right-of-way, there is little access to the old route between Carlos and Nelleva.http://www.abandonedrails.com/Mexia-Nelleva_Cutoff  References  Category:Railroad cutoffs Category:Geography of Grimes County, Texas Category:Geography of Limestone County, Texas ","title":"Mexia-Nelleva Cutoff"},{"id":"37946531","text":"For Valour may refer to: * For Valour (1928 film), a British silent film directed by G.B.

David Lynch's 1986 film Blue Velvet featured the song. On Broadway, he wrote music for Listen to Liz, Skits-oh-Frantics and Torero! He produced the soundtracks for Zorba the Greek in 1964 and for the 1965 film A Patch of Blue as director of artists and repertoire at 20th Century Fox Records. He also created some of the more memorable instrumental novelty melodies in the Easy Listening genre. Examples include \\"The Magic Touch\\" from the film More About Love, \\"Port-au- Prince\\" (a Nelson Riddle single), and \\"Vanessa\\" (recorded by Hugo Winterhalter and his Orchestra, and used as a theme song for several 1950s TV series.)

He also sired Epsom Derby winner and Champion sire, Galopin. He was owned by Thomas Dundas, 2nd Earl of Zetland and trained by George Abdale. Background Vedette was bred by Mr. Chilton and Anthony Harrison and was a brown (almost black) colt foaled in 1854. He was sired by Epsom Derby and St. Leger Stakes winner Voltigeur. His dam was Mrs. Ridgway, a daughter of Birdcatcher. Racing career 1856: two-year-old season In August 1856 he finished third in the Eglington Stakes over one mile at York. The race was won by the favourite Augury. In October he won the Bedford Stakes at by two lengths from The Western Power, after starting as the 4/6 favourite. At the end of the year he was priced around 7/1 for the 1857 2000 Guineas Stakes. 1857: three-year-old season Vedette returned to the racecourse as a three-year-old in the 2000 Guineas Stakes at Newmarket. He started the one-mile race as the 5/2 favourite of the eleven strong field. Also near the front of the betting were Loyola at 4/1, Kent at 9/2 and Anton at 5/1. The horses got away to an even break on the second start attempt and Turbit immediately took the lead, with Vedette a few lengths behind in fourth place. As they neared the closing stages Loyola (who was racing with Anton on the other side of the track) and Vedette caught and passed Turbit. Anton was winning by about a length in the final furlong, but Vedette produced a \\"tremendous rush\\" and overtook him in the last 50 yards. Vedette won the race by three quarters of a length from Anton, who finished a head in front a third placed Loyola. After winning the 2000 Guineas Vedette was very lame and had to hobble back from the weighing room to his stable. He was unable to run until the Great Yorkshire Stakes at York in August, where he was the 2/5 favourite. He won the race by three lengths from Skirmisher, with Saunterer about three lengths further behind in third place. Vedette then went to Doncaster and won the Fitzwilliam Stakes by a neck from Princess Royal. His final race of the season came in the Doncaster Cup, which he won by a neck from Black Tommy. 1858: four-year-old season Vedette's first race as a four-year-old came on 9 April 1858 in the Port Stakes at Newmarket. The race was over a distance just short of two miles and Vedette started as the 4/6 favourite. He led his only opponent, Odd Trick, in the early stages, but was then overtaken and was beaten by three quarters of a length. Vedette then won the Great Ebor Handicap by half a length from Tunstall Maid, after starting as the 5/2 favourite. Tunstall Maid was a further three lengths clear of third placed Fisherman. Vedette's final race came in the Doncaster Cup. Vedette started as the 1/2 favourite, with Saunterer next in the betting at 6/1, then Fisherman at 7/1 and Black Tommy at 100/8. Vedette won the two and a half mile race by half a length from Saunterer, with Black Tommy a further six lengths behind in third place. His win was thought of as a win for all of Yorkshire and apparently there hadn't been \\"such cheering and waving of hats\\" since Voltigeur won the St Leger Stakes and Doncaster Cup in 1850. Assessment Vedette was generally regarded as the best of the 1854 foals. Stud record Verdette sired Speculum who won the Goodwood Cup and City and Suburban Handicap. Speculum was also a successful sire, with his progeny including Epsom Derby winner Sefton and becoming British Champion sire in 1878. Verdette's best son was Galopin who won the Epsom Derby in 1875 and was British Champion sire three times. Vedette's sire line survives today mainly through Galopin's son, the undefeated St. Simon, who was Champion sire nine times. Pedigree Note: b. = Bay, blk. = Black, br. = Brown, ch. = Chestnut * Vedette was inbred 3x4 to Blacklock. This means that the stallion appears once in the third generation and once in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

Pete is portrayed by Jake Lacy. He is an original character and has no counterpart in the British version of the series, though his character is noted as having several parallels to Jim Halpert, who in turn is based on Tim Canterbury on the British series. Pete, along with Clark Green, is one of two staff members hired as customer service representatives at the Scranton branch of fictitious paper distributor Dunder Mifflin, replacing the outgoing Kelly Kapoor and Ryan Howard at the start of the show's ninth and final season. Biography Pete is said to be in his twenties and originally hails from Vermont (much like the actor who plays him). His interests include boxing, tennis, NASCAR, and The Amazing Race. His favorite baseball team is the Boston Red Sox. Little is known of Pete's family, except for having a brother who once dared Pete to memorize every line of the film Die Hard, which Pete would later say he loved doing. In a deleted scene in a prior episode, he receives a text from his brother, whom he identifies as 'Mike',http://www.officetally.com/archive/the-office-deleted-scenes however, it is unknown whether this is the same brother mentioned in \\"Dwight Christmas\\". His closest friends (outside of work) are mentioned as being Scott, Glenn, and Rob, as well as someone he refers to as \\"Flipper\\", who earned his nickname by once flipping a table while drunk, though Pete concedes that \\"Flipper\\" is \\"an idiot\\". His and Clark's vague resemblance to salesmen Jim Halpert and Dwight Schrute led to several office staff members initially referring to them as \\"New Jim\\" and \\"Dwight Junior\\", respectively. Season 9 Pete and Clark are introduced in \\"New Guys\\" as the new Customer Service Representatives. Several co-workers note their resemblance to Jim and Dwight, dubbing them \\"New Jim\\" and \\"Dwight Junior\\". After Andy Bernard returns from a wilderness retreat, he named Pete \\"Plop\\", supposedly because Pete is \\"always taking dumps\\" (despite having only known Pete for a matter of minutes), much to Pete's discomfort. Jim does not consider Pete to be \\"the new Jim\\", particularly after speaking with him and finding they have no common interests. Jim reconsiders this when Pete is interviewed by Angela Martin to potentially adopt her cat (something which does not particularly interest Pete), and Jim overhears Pete talking about his hopes and dreams, reminding Jim of his own dreams before he spent years at Dunder-Mifflin. In \\"Roy's Wedding\\", Pete is dubious when Clark invites Erin Hannon to a news audition at his apartment with various outfits, suspecting Clark merely wants to exploit Erin. Pete is stunned when Andy, oblivious to Clark's intentions, gives Clark his credit card and sends him to the mall with Erin to buy several additional outfits. Pete manages to thwart Clark's plans by convincing Andy to accompany her as a co-anchor (with Pete himself as \\"Andy's make-up guy\\"), much to Clark's disappointment. Andy soon becomes more preoccupied with his own performance than Erin's and requests additional takes. When Erin complains of being hungry, Andy asks Pete to take Erin out for a burger while he has a dismayed Clark continue shooting. Pete and Erin are later seen eating at a nearby diner, apparently enjoying themselves. In \\"Andy's Ancestry\\", Pete and Clark immediately applaud at the news that Andy may be distantly related to Michelle Obama, having learned that Andy appreciates enthusiasm, and therefore have learned to clap for almost any action or announcement. Pete is confused when Erin greets him in Dothraki, a fictional language she'd been learning to impress Andy. At the end of the day, however, Pete himself tells Erin good-bye in Dothraki, amusing both her and Andy. In \\"Work Bus\\" Pete, along with the rest of the staff, is confined to work on a bus rented by Dwight while the office undergoes renovations. In a deleted scene, he and Erin jokingly talk about a plan to kidnap Rupert Murdoch for ransom. After Andy refused to support Nellie Bertram's application for an adoption, Andy later overhears someone crying, which he assumes to be Nellie, until Pete coolly informs him it is actually Erin (who had herself been a foster child and never adopted). Pete and Erin are later seen talking in the background when the staff visits a pie stand. In \\"Here Comes Treble\\", Pete is one of the few employees, along with Jim, who does not dress up for Halloween. When Erin insists a student a cappella group from Andy's Cornell sing his signature song \\"Faith\\" by George Michael (despite admitting she finds his a cappella drama \\"pathetic\\"), she then passes Pete's desk and tells a confused Pete that \\"this isn't stupid.\\" In \\"The Boat\\", Pete seems somewhat puzzled by Erin indulging Andy's behavior (which she admits is juvenile), with things like trying to cheer him up with \\"watermelon teeth\\", despite Andy being around forty years old. When Andy and Erin drive to Connecticut to see off the Bernard family boat, which is being sold to pay off family debt, Pete covers reception for Erin. After Erin returns without Andy (Andy decided to sail the boat to its buyer in the Bahamas himself, taking his brother, but not her, much to her disappointment), Pete invites her to join some of his friends for drinks and pool. In \\"The Whale\\" Pete grows a mustache with several other male co-workers for \\"Movember\\" at the suggestion of Toby Flenderson, but after Erin is visibly put off by it (awkwardly attempting to compliment it as a \\"handsome\\" eyebrow of a \\"cyclops whose eye fell out\\"), Pete is seen in the following scene emerging from the washroom, having shaved his mustache off. In \\"The Target\\", Pete has been given the redundant task of filling out customer service complaint cards, despite the information already being on a computer. A bored Pete begins constructing a large tower out of the complaint cards, with Erin, and several other co- workers joining in. When Kevin Malone attempts to add a card to the tower, only to knock it over, and is berated by the others for it, Pete defends Kevin, reminding them the entire tower is built on mistakes, which visibly impresses Erin. In \\"Dwight Christmas\\", Pete is surprised to learn Erin has never seen Die Hard, and tells her he knows every line, which she challenges him to recite. In the midst of doing so, however, Erin gets a text message from Andy, saying he'll be staying in the Bahamas an additional three weeks. Wanting to distract herself, she tells Pete they should watch the movie itself, which they do on a computer in Andy's office. Pete points out some items of trivia during the film, such as the fact that Alexander Godunov, who plays Karl, the main henchman, was a ballet dancer in real life. When Erin begins to cry, Pete puts his arm around her to comfort her. Erin reminds Pete that she is still Andy's girlfriend, which Pete acknowledges, though she tells him he can leave his arm around her. In \\"Lice\\", when much of the staff is infected with lice, the infected staff pair up to cover each other's hair with mayonnaise to kill the lice. When Creed Bratton volunteers to pair up with Erin, she quickly claims that she had already paired up with Pete. Erin appears somewhat uneasy when Pete later takes his shirt off before rinsing out his hair, and Erin avoids him for the rest of the day. In \\"Suit Warehouse\\", Pete gives Erin a friendly hello, though she continues avoiding him, instead focusing on an incoming shipment of pens that Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) asked her to take care of while she's away. In \\"Customer Loyalty\\", Nellie had assigned Pete and Erin to work on a special project, only to notice their mutual interest. Not wanting to upset Andy, who had reconsidered signing her adoption letter before he left, she discourages anything from happening between them by bringing it up during a staff meeting, much to their embarrassment, especially when it becomes clear everyone in the office is aware they've been flirting. Erin insists she is still with Andy and that she and Pete are just friends and asks Nellie to shut down their project. Erin and Pete appear somewhat awkward around each other after this, however. After noticing this, Nellie reinstates the project and assigns them both to it, something that seems to please both Pete and Erin. In \\"Couples Discount\\" Erin decides to break up with Andy, but Pete is doubtful. After attempting to break up with Andy, Erin is talked out of it by Andy. Later on, Erin goes and tells Pete she couldn't do it. When Pete smiles and says he just wants her to be happy she realizes she wants to be with him, kisses him, and goes inside and finally breaks up with Andy. In secrecy from Andy and the rest of the branch, Pete and Erin begin dating in \\"Moving On\\", while a moping Andy begins to suspect Erin has begun seeing someone new. Andy snoops in Erin's phone and learns she's been texting Pete, though he initially doesn't realize who it is, since he's been referring to Pete as \\"Plop\\" for so long he's forgotten Pete's real name. When he eventually figures this out, Andy attempts to fire Pete, though Toby notes Andy has no cause to do this. When Pete and Erin urge Andy to simply move on, noting that Pete did the same after his break-up with his ex-girlfriend Alice, a vindictive Andy gets back at them by not only hiring Alice as strategy consultant, but also Erin's ex Gabe Lewis as a management consultant. The tension between exes soon devolves into bickering between one another, which pleases Andy to no end. A satisfied Andy later admits that seeing Pete and Erin unhappy, has made him happy. Pete did not appear in the episode \\"The Farm\\". In \\"Promos\\", his only role was to suggest Pam talk to her friend, boom mike operator Brian, after it becomes clear the documentary film crew have recorded far more intimate details about the staff's lives over the years than they realized. In \\"Paper Airplane\\", Pete, Erin, and the rest of the staff compete in a paper airplane competition for a $2000 grand prize. Pete himself apparently did not progress very far in the competition and instead supported Erin. He seemed somewhat taken aback by Erin's excessively competitive attitude, particularly her taunting Clark after beating him. After Erin lost to Dwight, he attempted to calm the furious Erin, without much success. In Livin' the Dream, Jim temporarily joins Pete in the annex after Clark takes his desk. Their conversation is somewhat awkward, as the two still have no common interest. Later, Pete and Erin appear offended when Jim and Pam appear hesitant at Erin's suggestion of a double date. In \\"A.A.R.M.\\", Pete is dismayed when Dwight addresses him as \\"Plop\\", despite Andy having quit in the previous episode. Most of the staff agree when Dwight says \\"We owe Andy that much\\", which Pete reluctantly accepts. Along with the rest of the staff, he objects when Darryl Philbin, who was also quitting to work at Athlead, attempted to slip out without saying goodbye. He's seen dancing with the others when Darryl agrees to dance with them for one final activity, and later watches the airing of the documentary at Poor Richard's with Erin and the others. In \\"Finale\\", which takes place one year after the airing of the documentary, Pete joins the staff at a panel, where he admits that everyone has since started calling him \\"Plop\\". He witnesses Erin being reunited with her parents at the panel, and they later attend Dwight and Angela's wedding and a documentary party at Dunder-Mifflin. Pete and Erin are seen dancing together at the wedding. Relationships Erin Hannon Pete quickly became friends with receptionist Erin Hannon, similar to Jim's early friendship with Erin's predecessor (and future wife) Pam Halpert. In \\"Roy's Wedding\\", he is clearly discomforted when Clark invites her to film a news anchor audition at his apartment, correctly suspecting this is merely a ruse by Clark to exploit her by filming her in various outfits. Pete manages to sabotage Clark's plan by convincing Andy, Erin's boyfriend, to accompany them as a \\"co-anchor\\". When Andy becomes more preoccupied with his own performance than Erin's, he asks Pete to take a hungry Erin out to eat, while the disappointed Clark is left filming Andy alone. In \\"Andy's Ancestry\\", when Erin attempts to impress Andy by learning the fictional Dothraki language from the TV series Game of Thrones (which Andy, stressed by work problems, is not particularly receptive of), Pete bids her farewell at the end of the day in Dothraki. In a deleted scene in \\"Work Bus\\", the two jokingly discussed pretending to kidnap Rupert Murdoch and could be later seen talking in the background, when the staff takes a trip to a pie stand. Though neither admitted it at the time, Pete and Erin each appeared concerned what the other thinks of them. In \\"Here Comes Treble\\", after telling an a cappella group from Andy's alma mater of Cornell to indulge Andy's childish demand that they sing his signature song, she tells Pete, \\"this isn't stupid\\", much to the confusion of Pete, who had made no comment on the matter. Conversely, in \\"The Whale\\", Pete grows a mustache with several other male co-workers for \\"Movember\\", but after seeing Erin's reaction to it, he immediately shaves it off. In \\"The Boat\\" Pete appears somewhat puzzled by Erin's willingness to indulge Andy's immaturity when his family undergoes a financial crisis. When Erin and Andy drive up to Connecticut to see off his family boat, which is being sold to a buyer in the Bahamas, Pete volunteers to cover reception for Erin. When Erin returns, disappointed that Andy had chosen to sail the boat to the Bahamas himself, taking his brother, but leaving Erin behind, Pete invites her to join him and his friend for drinks and pool, which she accepts. Erin appeared impressed after Pete stood up for Kevin Malone from his berating co-workers after Kevin accidentally knocked over a \\"comment card tower\\" several of them had been making. In \\"Dwight Christmas\\", Pete and Erin watch Die Hard together in Andy's office, to take her mind off Andy sending her an email saying he'll be staying in the Bahamas an extra three weeks. When Erin begins to cry, Pete puts his arm around her to comfort her. She reminds him that she's still Andy's girlfriend, which Pete acknowledges, though she tells him he can leave his arm around her. In \\"Lice\\", Erin appears somewhat troubled at her attraction to Pete, after seeing him remove his shirt during a hair-washing. Pete appears disappointed when Erin has apparently left for the day without saying goodbye, unaware that Erin was deliberately avoiding him, something she continues to do the following episode. In \\"Customer Loyalty\\", Erin has stopped avoiding Pete and the two appear to enjoy themselves when assigned to work on a special project. The two are embarrassed when Nellie and others bring up their flirting during a staff meeting, though both of them insist nothing is going on between them. Nellie shuts down their project after this, but later reconsider after seeing their awkward encounters. Both Pete and Erin seem pleased at this. In \\"Couples Discount\\", Pete is somewhat skeptical when he learns Erin intends to break up with the returning Andy. Indeed, Andy initially talks her out of breaking up with him, but after hearing Pete say he only wants her to be happy, she kisses him and immediately breaks up with Andy. The two are subsequently dating in secret during the episode \\"Moving On\\" Pete and Erin's relationship is not referenced for several subsequent episodes, but seems to be continuing on good terms. In \\"Paper Airplane\\", however, Pete is somewhat taken aback by Erin's highly competitive nature (which Erin admits she worries about Pete seeing) during a paper airplane competition, particularly after she throws a tantrum at losing. Despite this awkward moment the two are seen getting along well in \\"Livin' the Dream\\", though Pete and Erin appear offended by Jim and Pam's hesitance at Erin's suggestion of a double date. The two are seen dancing at Dwight and Angela's wedding reception one year later. They are also later seen leaving the Office hand in hand, implying their relationship has continued. Andy Bernard Both Pete and Clark are largely deferential to Branch Manager Andy Bernard, not having known him before his promotion, unlike most of the other staff. When Pete is first introduced to Andy in \\"New Guys\\", Andy assigns him the nickname \\"Plop\\", much to Pete's discomfort, because Andy claims Pete is \\"always taking dumps\\". The nickname would persist even after Andy quit. In \\"Andy's Ancestry\\", Pete and Clark have taken to applauding nearly any announcement or action by Andy, however mundane, after discovering that Andy appreciates enthusiasm. The two note in a talking head that their applause is beginning to have a reverse effect, causing them to genuinely believe simple actions like making copies or drinking water are impressive. In the same episode, Andy tells Erin he likes Pete and contemplates setting him up with Meredith Palmer (apparently unaware of Pete's obvious discomfort when Meredith propositioned him in \\"New Guys\\") Pete, however gave Andy a somewhat cold look in \\"Work Bus\\", when Andy's refusal help Nellie Bertram apply for an adoption caused Erin, herself a foster child who was never adopted, to cry. Any goodwill Andy had for Pete immediately evaporates after learning that Pete has been seeing Erin in \\"Moving On\\". Andy attempts to fire Pete for this, until Toby points out he has no cause to fire Pete. Andy later vindictively hires Pete and Erin's respective exes, specifically to cause tension, and later takes pleasure at their discomfort. Despite this incident, in \\"Livin' the Dream\\" Pete and Clark emerged from the annex and listened with interest when Andy played \\"I Will Remember You\\" for the staff on his last day. Clark Green Despite being roughly the same age, working in the same department, and being hired at the same time, Pete explicitly states in \\"Roy's Wedding\\" that Clark is not his friend, but is merely \\"the douche that sits next to me at the office\\". He clearly disapproves of Clark's attempt to exploit Erin with a fake news audition in that episode and successfully foils it. There has not been any apparent tension between the two since then, however, and the two do agree on several things, such as how to behave around Andy. The two were seen playing a computer game together in \\"New Guys\\". In \\"The Whale\\" the two were seen hanging out with Toby Flenderson, Daryl Philbin, and Kevin Malone, all having grown mustaches for \\"Movember\\". Clark was apparently aware that Pete and Erin had been dating before anyone else in the office. He appeared somewhat amused at Pete's awkwardness around Andy before Andy found out, and later found it funny when Andy later hired Pete's ex-girlfriend Alice to work with him to get back at him. Pete and Clark's relationship has apparently improved over time. When Clark takes Jim's desk, briefly relegating Jim to Clark's desk in the annex, Jim suggests to Pete that he probably missed Clark, which Pete seems to acknowledge. Clark, for his part, sardonically warns Jim \\"it is very easy to get lost in Pete's beautiful, dead eyes.\\" Jim Halpert Though several co-workers in \\"New Guys\\" referred to Pete as \\"the New Jim\\", Jim himself dismissed this initially, particularly after chatting with Pete, and finding they had no common interests. Jim later overhears some of Pete's dreams, however, reminding him of his own, before years of working at Dunder-Mifflin, which motivates Jim to pursue an opportunity to join in a start-up sports marketing company. When Jim is briefly relegated to Clark's desk across from Pete in the annex, the two attempt to bond but are as awkward as ever, as the two still have no common interests, and Pete even admits to missing Clark. Toby Flenderson Toby appears to enjoy interacting socially with the much younger Pete and Clark, though neither appear as interested in socializing with Toby. In \\"The Whale\\", both Pete and Clark, along with Daryl Philbin and Kevin Malone agreed to grow mustaches for \\"Movember\\", at Toby's suggestion. In a deleted scene, however, Toby was dismayed when he saw that Pete had shaved his mustache off. When Nellie attempts to separate Pete and Erin in \\"Customer Loyalty\\", to prevent Andy from being hurt, Toby gently reminds her that Andy himself had not been a good boyfriend, but describes Pete as \\"a pretty cool guy\\". He's clearly impressed when Nellie reconsiders and puts the two back to working together again. Reception The introduction of a new potential love interest for Erin in the show's final season, complicating her relationship with Andy, was conceived by show-runner Greg Daniels, with input from Ellie Kemper, who plays Erin. \\"I really appreciate how much he wanted my own contribution to what this potentially new love interest for Erin should be like and how this affects Erin,\\" Kemper told TVGuide.com. \\"Erin has a habit of saying dumb things and not thinking things through, but at the end of the day, I do want to think of her as a three-dimensional character that has room to mature and develop. So, I think that is such a nice thing to happen in the final season and he spear- headed that.\\" Regarding the potential love triangle, Kemper said \\"I think it's really important in terms of Erin's maturity to have someone else to relate to. In a surprising way, Erin is craving a more mature relationship that doesn't depend on acting on a whim. Andy and Erin have a lot of cute, but very childish bits that they do with each other. With Pete, it's more of a mature relationship. He's calm and sincere with her in a way that maybe Andy isn't always. ... There's a sense of stability with Pete that could be attractive to Erin.\\" This met with mostly positive reviews. Regarding the storyline in \\"Dwight Christmas\\", IGN.com noted that \\"The writers remain determined to rewrite (Andy and Erin's) love story, but in a way that doesn't make the audience feel jerked around. It's more like being slowly led by the hand toward another possible destination. I don't know where this triangle will end up, but I don't resent the journey like I did last season.\\" Paste Magazine's response to the storyline in the same episode was more mixed. \\"It‚Äôs a sweet moment, but it seems almost too cookie-cutter for the show.\\" References External links * Pete Miller at NBC.com Category:The Office (American TV series) characters Category:Television characters introduced in 2012 Category:Fictional characters from Vermont Category:Male characters in television ","title":"Pete Miller"},{"id":"37946893","text":"St Peter's Church is in the village of Chelmarsh, Shropshire, England. It is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Bridgnorth, the archdeaconry of Ludlow, and the diocese of Hereford. Its benefice is united with those of seven other churches to form the benefice of Highley with Billingsley, Glazeley and Deuxhill, and Chelmarsh. The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building. History The body of the church dates from the 14th century, and replaced an earlier church on the site. This part of the church was probably completed by 1345, when a chantry chapel was endowed by Hugh de Mortimer. The lower part of the west tower is also from this time, the upper part being added in about 1720. The south porch was built in 1887 by J. Farmer of Newport. Architecture The body of the church is constructed in stone, and is in Decorated style. Re-set in the north wall is a Norman doorway from an earlier church. The upper parts of the tower are in brick with stone dressings, and in Neoclassical style. The tower has a west doorway, above which is a three-light window. There are diagonal buttresses, alternating quoins, paired round-headed bell openings, and a balustrade on the summit. On the south side of the church is a porch, a priest's doorway and three tall two-light windows. The east window has five lights. Inside the church is a four-bay arcade carried on octagonal piers. The stained glass in the east window is dated 1892, it was designed by Kempe, and depicts the Crucifixion. In the south window of the chancel is glass by Burlison and Grylls, dating from about 1888, and depicting the Parable of the Sower. In the chancel is part of a tomb chest in Perpendicular style. A pair of similar marble plaques separately form parish war memorials to the dead of either World War, accompanied by framed displays of a photograph of each man listed, and nearby hangs an embroidered regimental badge of the King's Shropshire Light Infantry. The two-manual pipe organ was made by Nicholson and Son of Gloucester. There is a ring of six bells, all of which were cast in 1720 by Abraham Rudhall II of Gloucester. External features The churchyard contains a war grave of a World War II airman.

It was the heart of a railway company, which from 1925 also ran bus services and from 1956 its passenger services only ran by road. Goods trains continued to run until 1967, when the remaining trackage was lifted. The firm was founded on 3 February 1869 as the Br√∂l Valley Railway Company (Br√∂lthaler Eisenbahn-Actien-Gesellschaft) or BTE. On 10 June 1921 it was renamed as the Rhine-Sieg Railway (Rhein-Sieg-Eisenbahn- AG) or RSE. The company headquarters was moved in 1917 from Hennef (Sieg) to Beuel. In 1983 the RSE went into the Rhein-Sieg-Verkehrsgesellschaft. It should not be confused with the Rhein-Sieg-Eisenbahn GmbH founded in 1994 by the Verkehrsclub Deutschland. The 785 mm gauge railway network of the Br√∂l Valley Railway was, at its peak, a total of 87.3 kilometres long and, towards the end, was mainly worked by goods services. With the take over of the Heisterbach Valley Railway in 1901 an isolated section of 750 mm gauge line also belonged to the BTE. In the old Br√∂l Valley Railway engine shed in Asbach is a railway museum about the old railway that was founded in 2000.

Life and career Daniele Trinchero received the Laurea degree in electronic engineering and Ph.D. degree in electronic and telecommunication engineering from the Politecnico di Torino, Turin, Italy, in 1993 and 1997, respectively. In 1996-1997 he was with the Italian National Council of Research (CNR), Turin, Italy. In 1996, he visited Loughborough University, Loughborough, U.K. Since December 1997, he has been with the Electronics Department, Politecnico di Torino, where in December 2004, he founded the iXem Labs, and since then, has been responsible for them. In 2010 and 2011 he visited the College of Engineering, Qatar University, Doha, Qatar. He then assisted the department in providing instruction in courses in Electromagnetics in Spring 2014. With the Politecnico di Torino, he has been teaching courses about radio communications, radio planning, Internet of Things, basic electromagnetic theory, electromagnetic compatibility, and electromagnetic field measurements. Starting from 2011, he has started experiencing innovative teaching methods involving the use of social networks and direct student participation to the teaching activity. One of these experiments has been selected as a best practice by the \\"European Competition for Best Innovations in University Outreach and Public Engagement\\" organized in early 2012 by the Oxford Internet Institute. His major field of study is related to electromagnetic field propagation applied to the design of wireless components and networks. His research interests include wireless sensor networks, geographical wireless networks, long-distance communications, sensing technology, antennas, electromagnetic field propagation, electromagnetic field measurements, electromagnetic compatibility, microwave devices, frequency-selective surfaces, shielding devices, and telecommunication solutions for digital inclusion of developing regions. Internet for Peace Campaign In 2010 Daniele Trinchero was chosen by the magazine Wired Italia as one of the twelve testimonials to support the candidature of Internet for the Nobel Prize. The proposal is based on the idea that \\"the Internet is a powerful tool for democracy enhancement and preservation. Global communication through the Internet is the most effective means to overcome political and military barriers, to spread knowledge and to affirm the culture of collaboration and sharing\\", as Riccardo Luna says.\\"Commenti di Riccardo Luna\\" The campaign has been supported by Riccardo Luna's book \\"Internet √® un Dono di Dio\\",\\"Internet √® un Dono di Dio\\" which dedicates a chapter to Daniele Trinchero's activity to break digital isolation in South America and Africa, and Wired Italia, which dedicated a section of the March 2010 Issue to Daniele Trinchero, referred since then as \\"Mr. Wireless\\".\\"Mr. Wireless\\" The Internet for Peace website, internetforpeace.org, contains all the details of the project together with the list of the \\"Ambassadors\\". Contribution to Water Waste Reduction Daniele Trinchero has conceived an application based on the use of Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks to improve water leakage reduction. This innovative wireless network architecture is based on the use of mobile sensors able to flow free of any anchorage through underground pipes, to detect physical parameters of the medium and to transmit the information to the surface. This activity has already led to a patent, filed together by Politecnico di Torino, Qatar University and QU Wireless Research Cente. The device takes the name WaterMOLE and represents and innovative solution to detect, by application of radio techniques, fluid leakages in water and gas distribution infrastructures.

Born in Copenhagen, by 1705 he was employed as a court sculptor and stonemason. He was engaged in numerous royal projects; from 1705-09 he was responsible for the decoration of the Rosenborg Castle with stucco details. From 1709-11 he added stucco ceilings to Fredensborg Castle, and from 1726-28 renovated the altar, pulpit, baptismal font and the Royal chair in Fredensborg Chapel. In 1728 he was contracted to produce work for four churches which had been burned down in Copenhagen, the Frue, Petri, Helliggejst and Trinitatis churches. His works were mainly in the Late Baroque style, with many marble works. His house was lost in the 1728 fire, but he rebuilt it in 1733, but was succumbed to poverty for the remaining 15 years of his life.

Saradhi, C.V.; Murthy, C.S.R.; , \\"Segmented protection paths in WDM mesh networks,\\" High Performance Switching and Routing, 2003, HPSR. Workshop on , vol., no., pp. 311- 316, 24‚Äì27 June 2003 doi: 10.1109/HPSR.2003.1226724 Examples In \\"Working path\\" animation on the right it can be seen that for a chosen route the primary path becomes the working path. This example illustrates that the source (node A) is routed to B,then C,D,E, and lastly the destination (node F). We can see that segment protection has been implemented. Segment Alpha consists of nodes A, B, C, and D while segment Beta consists of nodes C, D, E, and F. Lets assume that link B-C failed. Nodes B and C know that the link between them is down so they signal to their neighboring nodes that a link is down and to move to a backup path. Node A sends its traffic over to node D directly. Node D then sends the traffic over its route to E then finally destination F. Note: in this case the segment protection path for segment Alpha does not contain any intermediate nodes; this is usually not the case, but the example would follow respectively. =Overlapping vs. non- overlapping= Overlapping and non-overlapping segment protection have one main difference but provide different protections at different costs.Kantarci, B.; Mouftah, H.T.; Oktug, S.; , \\"Availability analysis and Connection provisioning in overlapping shared segment protection for optical networks,\\" Computer and Information Sciences, 2008. ISCIS '08. 23rd International Symposium on , vol., no., pp.1-6, 27-29 Oct. 2008 doi: 10.1109/ISCIS.2008.4717963 The diagrams to the right, \\"overlapping protection\\" and \\"non-overlapping protection\\" illustrate the difference between the two. The overlapping scheme makes sure that there is at least one link that is protected by two segments, while the non-overlapping scheme begins a segment protection at the same node as the previous ended. Node protection is the main advantage of the overlapping scheme over the non-overlapping scheme. Node protection that is provided allows a path to be provisioned if a node goes offline. In the diagram, \\"Overlapped link\\", we can see that link C-D has protection from segment Alpha and segment Beta. This type of protection allows node C to fail and for the backup of segment Alpha to be used. The path would then be node A to D to E to F. This would work the same if node D failed. The corresponding path to that failure would be node A to B to C to F. Non- overlapping segment protection does not provide node protection at every node. This scheme is only able to recover from a node failure that is not at the segment end node. In the diagram, \\"Non-overlapping protection\\", if node D fails a path cannot be provisioned from node A, the source, to node F, the Destination. Non-overlapping segment protection is a more cost efficient solution because only the end node of every segment requires to have extra ports. In the long term it is more cost efficient to implement overlapping segment protection because the a provisioned circuit's availability would be much higher. =Backup variations= Dedicated segment protection and shared segment protection are both available for use. Shared segment protection allows a more efficient network to be deployed. Both of these schemes can be implemented on an overlapping and a non-overlapping network topology. The \\"working path\\" diagram illustrates the dedicated-overlapping segment protection. \\"Shared segment protection\\", on the right, illustrated a shared- non-overlapping segment protection. Working paths, A and B, both have segment protection. The first segment protection path consists of, node A to B to C to D and the second consists of, node D to E to F. In this example we can see that if part of working path A, node D to F, would fail that node D would use its shred segment protection for that segment. The new path for working path A would be, A to D to E to F. Of course, if a second failure occurred on the same segment before the first failure is fixed a recovery would not be possible. Shared segment protection provides a higher efficiency. Although the networks provided here as examples are simple the benefits of sharing are noticeable. In the previous example we can see that a new backup segment protection is not necessary for each working path. When this scheme is scaled to a large network a substantial cost improvement can be seen. Implementation This protection scheme can be implemented in most mesh networks. Of course, the larger the network the more possibilities are available. Determining the working path is found by the routing algorithm. We are not limited to any one particular algorithm, but we must make modifications to allow for segments to be created with a protection path for each segment. Another important parameter is the number of hops or distance that each segment should have to have an optimal network. Although there is no secret number that would work for any network, there have been studies which show their experiment results.Tewari, R.; Ramamurthy, B.; , \\"Optimal segment size for fixed-sized segment protection in wavelength-routed optical networks,\\" Advanced Networks and Telecommunication Systems (ANTS), 2009 IEEE 3rd International Symposium on , vol., no., pp.1-3, 14-16 Dec. 2009 doi: 10.1109/ANTS.2009.5409857 Algorithms Generalized Segment Protection \\"The algorithm works as follows: K working paths are selected based on a predetermined criterion (shortest path, minimum unavailability, shortest hop count, etc.). Upon selecting the K-paths, for each working path, the links along the working path are reversed. The cost of every link that has at least one spare channel is degraded by a negligible coefficient Œµ. Each link that originates out of the working path but ends on the working path is modified so that its end point is moved to the previous node on the working path. Finally a path from source to destination is selected. Upon obtaining the path, the modified links are restored, and the connection is provisioned with the corresponding backup segments\\"C. Ou, S.

He was a brother of Kuƒçuk Alija, who was a Janissary, a mutesellim and one of four Dahiyas (leaders of rebel Janissaries) who controlled Belgrade Pashaluk from 1802 until the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising.  Biography  Sali Aga was born to the ƒêevrliƒá family from Rudnik. Before the First Serbian Uprising he was appointed by the Dahiyas to the position of mutesellim of Rudnik nahiyah and became known for his cruelty towards the local Christian population. He was particularly proud of his nickname, \\"Rudnik bull\\", which he received because of orgies with the local Christian population that he organized for him and his men. On Sali Aga's orders Christian brides and young women were brought to his wooden house near Rudnik every Sunday to dance in front of him so he could choose the most beautiful of them. If there was more than one bride he liked he would choose them to stay with him for the night. Sometimes he would keep a bride with him for a longer time. While they danced they sang songs dedicated to him, some of them still preserved in sources. Sali Aga organized orgies not only in his house but at festivals in villages around Rudnik. He introduced a special 'queens' custom in every nearby village in which he chose three young women and awarded them with titles of queen, king and flag-bearer. They had to serve drink and food to him and his men and to do whatever he demanded from them. The 'flag-bearer' was in charge to hold Sali Aga's flag, the 'king' was to serve rakia which was poured in Sali Aga's mouth by the 'queen' who also fed him.  First Serbian Uprising  At the end of February 1804, at the beginning of the First Serbian Uprising, 500 rebels commanded by Arsenije Loma and Petar Tre≈°njevƒçanin besieged Rudnik. The district was under the control of Sali Aga, reinforced by Ali Aga D≈æaviƒá from U≈æice and Pljako from Karanovac (modern-day Kraljevo) and their 500 Janissaries. The Serbian rebel leader Karaƒëorƒëe joined the besieging forces on 2 March 1804 and invited local Muslim leaders loyal to the Ottoman Sultan to join negotiations, hoping to divide them from Janissaries loyal to the Dahiyas. A leader of the local Muslims, Tokatliƒá, responded to Karaƒëorƒëe's invitation and was given a request that Sali Aga, D≈æaviƒá and Pljako should either surrender or leave Rudnik. Tokatliƒá soon came back with D≈æaviƒá who informed Karaƒëorƒëe that the three Janissary commanders accepted the request to leave Rudnik. On the following day, 3 March, they requested additional seven days to make their retreat, moved their families into the fortress and sent a messenger to Kuƒçuk Alija requesting his help. According to Kosta S. Protiƒá, a runaway Serb from Rudnik told Karaƒëorƒëe about Sali Aga's plans. He decided to attack the town and fortress of Rudnik. When Sali Aga realized that the Serbian rebels would attack Rudnik he decided to attack first but was defeated, leaving 86 dead Janissaries on the battlefield. Without any food in the fortress, Sali Aga had to inform Karaƒëorƒëe that he would accept the Serbian demand to leave Rudnik together with D≈æaviƒá, Pljako and the other Janissaries. The Serbian rebels captured Rudnik on 11 March.

The sculptures are on topics mostly concerning Scottish literature and poetry, and are made out of old books by an anonymous female paper sculptor. The initial group of book sculptures was a group of ten elaborate sculptures that were left around various cultural locations in Edinburgh, Scotland, between March and November 2011, as gifts to the cultural institutions and people of the city. The identity of the artist is unknown, although notes with some of the sculptures referred to the artist as 'she'. The sculptures were made from old books and were accompanied by gift labels which praised literacy and the love of words, and argued against library and other arts funding cuts. An eleventh sculpture was presented to author Ian Rankin, whose works featured prominently in many of the other sculptures. The ten Edinburgh sculptures were toured through Scotland in an exhibition in late 2012. The sculptor was then commissioned to produce five more book sculptures to be hidden in secret locations around Scotland as part of Book Week Scotland, which commenced in November 2012. Despite the commission, the artist has maintained her anonymity. The sculptor also made another gift sculpture in December 2012, which she anonymously presented to the Scottish Poetry Library, already the previous recipient of two of her earlier works. In May 2013 a new sculpture, featuring three eggs in a paper nest in a cardboard birdbox, was left in the Scottish Poetry library; this was followed by three baby birds in a nest, left at Leith Library. In 2014 a flutter or swarm of butterflies from an open book sculpture was left in aid of the Macmillan charity. This sculpture was bought privately but is intending to tour for a not-for-profit basis in 2015. 2011 Edinburgh sculptures These are listed in the order of their discovery. In the first ten cases, the person who deposited the sculptures was not noticed, and some of the sculptures were found several days after they had been put in place. The eleventh was a gift to author Ian Rankin. First sculpture The first sculpture was found on Tuesday 2 March 2011 on a table in the Scottish Poetry Library. It comprised a tree with intricately fashioned branches and leaves, standing on a thick leather-bound old book. At the base of the tree was a paper egg, broken in half and with the inside lined with gold, in which were a scatter of individual words, which could be put together to make \\"A Trace of Wings\\", a poem by Edwin Morgan. It was accompanied by a tag, addressed to @byleaveswelive, the name of the Library's Twitter account. \\"By leaves we live\\" is a Patrick Geddes quote about the idea that you reap what you sow. The note on the tag read: \\"It started with your name @byleaveswelive and became a tree.‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ We know that a library is so much more than a building full of books‚Ä¶ a book is so much more than pages full of words.‚Ä¶ This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas‚Ä¶.. a gesture (poetic maybe?)\\". The sculpture was nicknamed the \\"poetree\\" by the staff at the Library, and despite national publicity, the identity of its maker remained unknown. Second sculpture The second sculpture was found in late June 2011 at the National Library of Scotland, a \\"delicately crafted\\" gramophone and a coffin fashioned from a copy of Edinburgh-based author Ian Rankin's book Exit Music. The note accompanying the sculpture read: \\"For @natlibscot ‚Äì A gift in support of libraries, books, words, ideas‚Ä¶.. (& against their exit)\\". Third sculpture Later on in June 2011 a third sculpture was anonymously deposited, this time at the box office of the Edinburgh Filmhouse. This one comprised \\"a complex scene in a paper cinema; punters arrayed on seats watching men and horses coming alive from the screen and charging outwards.\\" One of the audience had Ian Rankin's face, and was holding a bottle of Deuchars IPA. The note accompanying the sculpture read: \\"For @filmhouse ‚Äì A gift in support of libraries, books, words, ideas‚Ä¶.. and all things *magic*\\". A quote from Francis Ford Coppola, \\"I think cinema, movies, and magic have always been closely associated\\" was pasted onto the sculpture. Fourth sculpture The fourth sculpture was found on a windowsill at the Scottish Storytelling Centre. As it lay in a part of the building that does not have much footfall, it may have lain undiscovered at the location for a while, and so its place in the gift chain is uncertain. It comprises a dragon hatching from an egg on a nest of feathers. It is made from a copy of Ian Rankin's book, Knots and Crosses. The note accompanying the sculpture read: \\"For @scotstorycentre ‚Äì A gift in support of libraries, books, works, ideas‚Ä¶.. Once upon a time there was a book and in the book was a nest and in the nest was an egg and in the egg was a dragon and in the dragon was a story‚Ä¶..\\" Fifth sculpture The fifth and sixth sculptures were both found on 24 August 2011, at the Edinburgh International Book Festival. The fifth sculpture was left on one of the signing tables in the festival bookshop. It comprised a tea tray bearing a cup of tea on a cake stand, a cupcake, a used teabag and a (real) old book. The teabag was filled with cut out letters, on the tag of which were the words \\"by leaves we live\\" (the Twitter name of the Scottish Poetry Library account referenced in the first sculpture). On the top of the tea in the teacup was a spiral swirl of words which read \\"Nothing beats a nice cup of tea (or coffee) and a really good BOOK\\", and on the tray next to the cupcake: \\"except maybe a cake as well\\". The note accompanying the sculpture read: \\"To @edbookfest 'A gift' This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ & festivals xx\\". Sixth sculpture The fifth and sixth sculptures were both found on 24 August 2011, at the Edinburgh International Book Festival. The sixth sculpture was secreted about the Edinburgh UNESCO City of Literature information stand in the entrance tent. It shows a man sitting under a tree. It is made from an Everyman's Library edition of The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner by James Hogg. The note accompanying the sculpture read: \\"To @edincityoflit 'A gift' LOST (albeit in a good book) This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúNo infant has the power of deciding‚Ä¶.. by what circumstances (they) shall be surrounded.. Robert Owen\\". Seventh sculpture The seventh sculpture was found on 30 August 2011 on a bookshelf at Edinburgh Central Lending Library. It comprises a magnifying glass on a stand on top of a (real) old book. Some words on the book are also shown in the lens of the magnifying glass: \\"When I go in I want it bright, I want to catch whatever is there in full sight\\". The note accompanying the sculpture read: \\"For Central Library 'A Gift' @Edinburgh_CC This is for you in support of libraries, books, words, ideas‚Ä¶. Libraries are expansive\\". The word 'expensive' has had the E crossed out and replaced with an A. The tag also notes, \\"Words on book ‚Äì Edwin Morgan\\". Eighth sculpture The eighth sculpture was found on 23 November 2011 in the Scottish Poetry Library, where the first sculpture was found in March 2011. The staff were first alerted to its presence by a note which the sculptor had left in the guest book: \\"Hopefully next time I‚Äôll be able to linger longer ‚Äì I‚Äôve left a little something for you near Women‚Äôs Anthologies X. In support of Libraries, Books, Words and Ideas‚Ä¶.\\" The sculpture was found on a bookshelf. The sculpture comprised two parts: an elaborate cap made of a wing of finely cut paper feathers, and a pair of gloves with 'bumblebee' stripes. The note accompanying the sculptures was written on both sides. It described the inspiration for the sculptures, a quote from the poem \\"Gifts\\" by Scottish poet Norman MacCaig: \\"To @ByLeavesWeLive....... The gifts 'Gloves of bee's fur, cap of the Wren's Wings.......' Norman McCaig .... maybe sometimes impossible things... In support of Libraries, Books, Words Ideas....\\" and \\"10/10\\". A longer note accompanying the piece made clear that this sculpture was the last in a series of ten sculptures: \\"It's important that a story is not too long ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶does not become tedious ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. 'You need to know when to end a story,' she thought. Often a good story ends where it begins. This would mean a return to the Poetry Library. The very place where she had left the first of the ten. Back to those who had loved that little tree, and so encouraged her to try again ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.and again. Some had wondered who it was, leaving these small strange objects. Some even thought it was a ‚Äòhe‚Äô! ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. As if! Others looked among Book Artists, rather good ones actually‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. But they would never find her there.

Someone‚Äôs left behind a pair of gloves and a cap‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.? Cheers Edinburgh It‚Äôs been fun! X\\" The revelation that this was the tenth sculpture caused some concern, as only eight were known of at this point. It was feared that the other two might have been lost or stolen or even simply thrown away by someone who didn't realise what they had found. Ninth sculpture The ninth sculpture was found on 24 November 2011 at the National Museum of Scotland, where it had been placed on the plinth under a stag skeleton. It comprised a tyrannosaurus rex bursting out of a copy of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World. Small human figures with weapons were amongst the shredded leaves of the book. The note accompanying the sculpture read: \\"For @NtlMuseumsScot A Gift Your friends at @edbookfest suggested you might like this. ‚Ä¶. In support of libraries, books, words, ideas and those places that house our treasures‚Ä¶‚Ä¶\\". and \\"9/10\\". Tenth sculpture This sculpture was the eighth in the gift chain, but was the last to be found, on 24 November 2011. It was found at the Writers' Museum in Edinburgh, on top of the donations box in the Robert Louis Stevenson room. It comprises a moonlit street scene, and is fashioned from a copy of Ian Rankin's second Rebus novel, Hide and Seek. It bore the words \\"commingled out of Good and evil\\", which is a quote from Stevenson's Jekyll and Hyde. The note accompanying the sculpture read: \\"@CuratorEMG A Gift 'The stories are in the stones' Ian Rankin In support of Libraries, Books, Words, Ideas ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ and Writers.\\" and \\"8/10\\". Eleventh sculpture Although the artists had said that the series comprised ten sculptures, on 25 November 2011 an eleventh was delivered to the Edinburgh Bookshop, an independent booksellers, addressed to Ian Rankin. The sculpture comprises two skeletons sitting on a coffin lid; the open coffin is cut out of a (real) old book. The skeletons are drinking and smoking, and listening to a record on a portable record player. The record sleeve reads \\"The Impossible Dead/Ian Rankin/Some Secrets Never Die\\" and the coffin lid reads \\"R.I.P. 13/10/11\\". 13 October 2011 was the publishing date of Rankin's novel The Impossible Dead. The note accompanying the sculpture read: \\"For @Beathhigh A Gift \\"‚Ä¶ something in us never dies\\" (R. Burns 1790) In support of those who turn ideas into words, words into books ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ & of course books into libraries.\\" and \\"11/10\\". @Beathhigh is Ian Rankin's Twitter account name. Reaction The sculptures, and the mystery over the identity of their creator, made local, then national and international news. As of December 2012, the identity of the creator has still not been revealed. The ten Edinburgh sculptures were brought together in December 2011 for a one night private exhibition at the Scottish Parliament. The Edinburgh sculptures were sent on a small 'mini tour' of Scotland between 17 August and 8 December 2012, appearing at Aberdeen Central Library, Dundee Central Library, Wigtown Book Festival, Mitchell Library, Glasgow, Dunfermline Carnegie Library and the Scottish Poetry Library. In the book giftED that was published in time for the tour, the sculptor wrote that at the heart of the project was \\"a woman, who had been a girl, whose life would have been less rich had she been unable to wander freely into libraries, art galleries and museums. A woman who, now all grown, still wants access to these places and yes, wants them for her children...\\". The photographs in the book are by Chris Scott. In July 2012 it was reported that a documentary about the sculptures, featuring Ian Rankin and Rory Bremner, is being made. After the tour concluded the original ten sculptures were sent back to their original locations with the bespoke plinths made for the exhibition with the intention that they continue to be accessible to the public. 2012: Flowers In August 2012 the sculptor left fifty paper flower sculptures around the site of the Edinburgh International Book Festival, each with the Oscar Wilde quote \\"‚Ä¶ freedom, books, flowers and the moon\\" and on the reverse \\"A Gift For You\\" and a limited edition number of /50. 2012: Five Book Week Scotland sculptures In November 2012 it was announced that the sculptor had been approached via an anonymous email account and had agreed to make five more sculptures that were to be hidden around Scotland as part of Book Week Scotland, and that the finders would be given another small sculpture as a prize. Online clues to their whereabouts were released, one a day between 26 and 30 November 2012. Each sculpture was found on the day the clue was released; the person to reach it first each day received a paper sculpture trophy in the shape of a teacup, themed on the book and reading \\"A winning cop and a good book - the perfect combination\\" on the top. First sculpture The first was found on 26 November 2012 at Glasgow School of Art. It is a book sculpture inspired by Alasdair Gray's classic novel Lanark: A Life in Four Books. The finder's prize was a sculpture of a small teacup with elements of the Lanark theme. The Lanark sculpture is now displayed next to the Glasgow School of Art shop during opening hours. Second sculpture The second sculpture was found at the Robert Burns Birthplace Museum in Alloway, and the sculpture was based on the Robert Burns poem \\"Tam O' Shanter\\" - which is set in Alloway. The finder's prize was a teacup featuring a horse's tail, a reference to the poem. The sculpture is on display at the Museum. Third sculpture The third sculpture was found at the Am Politician pub on the Isle of Eriskay, where the nine pupils of the Eriskay Primary School found the sculpture based on the Compton Mackenzie novel Whisky Galore. The finder's prize was a teacup with a bottle labelled 'whisky galore' on the top. The sculpture is on display at the pub. Fourth sculpture The fourth sculpture was found at J M Barrie's birthplace in Kirriemuir, and was based on Peter Pan. The finder's prize was a teacup with a hook-tipped spout. Fifth sculpture The fifth sculpture was found at the Scottish Seabird Centre, North Berwick, and was based on Robert Louis Stevenson‚Äôs Treasure Island. The finder's prize was a teacup with a palm tree on the top. 2012: Another gift In November 2012 a third sculpture was given to the Scottish Poetry Library, with the instructions that the box in which it was held was not to be opened until 7 December 2012 - the last day of the exhibition of the original ten. Built upon a copy of Robert Louis Stevenson's poetry collection A Child's Garden of Verses it featured a girl sitting under a tree, wearing a crown and reading a book, while the facing page shows Stevenson's poem, \\"To My Mother\\". In the tree are the words, \\"You in a garden green\\" and \\"With me were king and\\"; on the girl's crown is the word \\"Queen\\". On the trunk of the tree are the words, \\"Were hunter, soldier, tar\\" and the inside of the small book reads, \\"And all the thousand things that children are\\". Some bunting dangling from the tree read \\"But time, which none can bind, While flowing fast away, leaves love behind.\\" These are all lines from Stevenson's poem, \\"To Willie And Henrietta\\". The note accompanying the sculpture read: \\" .... For the Love of Books. Every ending marks a new beginning.\\" 2013: Preparing to fly In May 2013 a new sculpture was left in the Scottish Poetry library. This comprises three blue paper eggs in a paper nest in a cardboard birdhouse; the nest is on a platform with threads that allow it to be lifted out - the instructions that came with it say, \\"Nest can sit at bottom, hang midway or be outside birdbox - it's yours now!\\" The box has images and text on either side with gold leaf in places. The eggs are threaded together with slips of paper which read, \\"Preparing to start\\", \\"Sleeping in the woods\\" and \\"Life's little things\\"; the eggs have the words, \\"nest-egg\\", \\"new moon\\" and \\"great ovation\\" stuck to them. The tag reads simply, \\"Preparing to Fly 1/3 In support of libraries, words, book, ideas ........ x\\". In June 2013 Leith Library received a sculpture of three baby birds in a nest, addressed both to the library itself (@leithlibrary) and to their Reader in Residence Emily Dodd (@auntyemily), only the second time one of the sculptures has been addressed to a person. Included with the book sculpture was a quote from A.A.Milne \\"It is more fun to talk with someone who doesn't use long, difficult words but rather short, easy words like 'what about lunch?'. In support of libraries, books, words, ideas. Preparing to Fly 2/3\\". 2014: Butterflies On The Move As part of the Macmillan Art Exhibition called 'Inspired' held in Bonhams, Edinburgh, an intricate work of butterflies emerging from a book was delivered, anonymously. This book sculpture was auctioned to raise funds for this charity. It was bought by the Mackenzie family of Edinburgh, who decided to tour this 'Butterflies' sculpture on a not-for-profit basis so that a wider audience could see it. The idea was that the generosity of the artist and the story should continue to inspire others, especially youngsters and those that had not yet been able to experience the 'book sculpture library tour' in Edinburgh. The Butterflies sculpture visited the following locations: The War Poets library, Edinburgh Napier University; BBC Scotland, Pacific Quay; Killin library, Killin; John Gray Library, East Lothian; Kirkwall library, Orkney; Glasgow Museum's Resource Centre, South Nitshill, Glasgow; Abbotsford House, Borders; Crighton Library, Dumfries; Aberdeen Central Library, Aberdeen. The sculpture's tour finished in the Scottish Parliament and was commented upon by MSPs and the First Minister. A 'time for reflection' parliamentary speech was given by Dr Colin Mackenzie, thanking the artist for her generosity and inspiration. During the tour the artist offered to collaborate with members of the public who sent in their own paper butterflies. Interview In January 2015 the artist gave an email interview to the BBC, in which she hinted that more sculptures were to come: \\"What makes you think 'Butterflies' is my most recent sculpture?\\".Mystery book sculptor answers questions bbc.co.uk, 12 January 2015, retrieved 24 December 2018. Email interview, photos of sculptures. The final curtain In March 2015 the artist announced that the time had come \\"to draw time on the project\\". The last sculpture would be a collaboration with the public. A request was made for the public to make their own butterflies before 31 July 2015. These butterflies would be made into a final sculpture.  2016: The Butterfly Tree and Lost Child The final paper sculpture was a collaboration with the general public in response to the Butterfly On The Move Tour. Butterflies flew in from all over the world and from all different age groups of contributors. The resulting sculpture was a 6'6' high tree with butterflies as 'leaves'. The tree was supported by a 'lost child'. The sculpture appeared at the Edinburgh Book Festival in August, 2016. A hand illustrated book was left with the sculpture. It tells the fictional story of the Butterfly Tree and how it reached out and comforted the Lost Child. The artist intends to remain unknown.

(Down with Weapons!) or Lay Down Your Arms! is the best-known novel by the author and peace activist Bertha von Suttner, who received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1905 for the book. The book was published in 1889 in German by the publisher Edgar Pierson in Dresden and became very quickly successful, both because of its look at war and peace and because it addressed the issue of women in society. Three years later, it was published in English as Lay Down Your Arms!, then in Italian in 1897 as Abbasso le Armi!, and in Spanish in 1905 as Abajo las armas!. The novel was printed in a total of 37 German editions before 1905. It has been translated into a total of sixteen languages, including Finnish, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Czech. Until the publication of All Quiet on the Western Front in 1929, Die Waffen nieder was the most important German language literary work concerning war. Von Suttner chose to write a novel instead of a nonfiction book because she believed that the novel form would reach a wider audience. Von Suttner published a monthly magazine which was also called Die Waffen nieder!. She also published a sequel to Die Waffen nieder, Marthas Kinder, in 1903, although it was never as popular as Die Waffen nieder. Die Waffen nieder was adapted into film twice, in 1914 and in 1952.  Plot  The novel is from the point of view of the Austrian countess Martha Althaus over the course of four wars. During the Second Italian War of Independence, at age 19, Althaus loses her husband, the count Arno Dotzky, and decides that she is against war. Her second husband, Baron Friedrich Tilling, shares her pacifistic convictions even though he is an officer in the Austrian army. He fought in the Second Schleswig War alongside Prussia in 1864, and in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. Althaus' sisters and brother die of cholera because of the war, and her father dies of grief after losing his children. Friedrich then retires from the army in order to support Althaus' peace activism. During the Franco-Prussian War, Friedrich is shot while staying in Paris because he is suspected of being a Prussian spy. Althaus' son from her first marriage, Rudolf, begins to follow in his mother's footsteps.

She was a Duchess of Mecklenburg by birth and by marriage Electoral Princess of Saxony.  Life  Sophie was the third of seven children and the second daughter of Duke Magnus II of Mecklenburg and his wife Sophie of Pomerania. On 1 March 1500, she married Electoral Prince John of Saxony. John and Sophie had a son together: * John Frederick I (1503‚Äì1554), succeed his father as Elector of Saxony, married in 1527 to Sibylle of Cleves (1512‚Äì1554) Torgau Altarpiece Sophie died shortly after the birth of her son before her husband became Elector. She was buried in the city church of St. Mary in Torgau. Her bronze grave plate was crafted by Peter Vischer the Elder in his workshop in Nuremberg, after a design by Jacopo de' Barbari. Her widow and his brother Frederick the Wise found an altar in her memory. It was dedicated to Saint Anne and the Fourteen Holy Helpers, and was inaugurated on 18 July 1505.

The church premise was in an area of lush greeneries with the famous Bahadur Shah Park at a stone's throw distance on the south. The north- south axial Nawabpur Road/Johnson Road, the most important commercial street connecting the old part of the city with the new, is on the west and separated the area from the court, Bank, DC's office and Jagannath University buildings across it. In fact the church overlooking the greens is a major focal of the city centre in the nineteenth century. History Construction of the church, located on the east side of Johnson Road, began in 1819 and was completed in 1821. It was inaugurated on 10 July 1824 by Bishop Reginald Heber of Calcutta (Kolkata) while he was visiting Dacca (Dhaka). It has served as cathedral church since 1951. It is said that the convicts from Dhaka Jail gave their labour to build this church as well. The Anglicans, Presbyterians, Congretationalists of East Bengal, and various Methodist and Baptist bodies joined together to form the Church of Pakistan in the early 1970s. After Bangladesh won its independence from Pakistan in 1971, the Diocese of Dhaka emerged from the Church of Pakistan as the independent Church of Bangladesh. The church is led by most reverend Paul S. Sarkar who in January 2003 became the third bishop of the Church of Bangladesh. The 71 parishes are divided into 2 dioceses. The church has approximately 15,600 members (2005). It has been a member of the World Council of Churches since 1975 and functions as part of the larger worldwide Anglican Communion. Architectural features The attraction of this building, built after the style of east churches, with a square clock tower with arch windows on its walls. The square clock tower rises in two stages, its top is embattled. The roof used wooden battens on iron joists. The roofs of the verandas on either side are set upon sloppy korhikath. The delicate stone and brick works of this white plastered building are still as immaculate as it has been for nearly two centuries. A small porch leads to the entrance of the church supported on four columns which are of perpendicular gothic design on top of the entrance. The west end of the nave is dominated by two grooved columns that are not weight bearing. The floor have tiles. There are two columns at the back of the rectangular nave which leads to a pulpit through an arch. The pulpit is rectangular and has a brass cross on the wall at the back. The altar, at the east end of the nave, is constructed of wood and also has a brass cross on top of it. There are elegant curved chairs for congregation. A stone font on the back of the nave. The walls of the church are adorned with stone tablets commemorating some of the members of the church. Even most of the thick teak furniture, altar, and ablution bowl (for baptising) in marble are still unblemished and in good working condition. However, the open colonnades around two sides of the nave (central axial hall) were walled up later. In 2005 the church authority has undertaken a massive renovation of the building. Archaeologist Sufi Mostafizur Rahman writes that, \\"Though the church is small in size, it is one of the most attractive ones in Bangladesh\\".

The building was the Pittsburgh Terminal Warehouse and Transfer Company, located in the South Side Flats neighborhood of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. This warehouse complex was designed by Charles Bickel and was designed in 1898, and built from 1904 to 1906. The structure was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on May 8, 2013. History The facility was conceived as a central point of connection between road, river, and rail transport. The River and Railroad Terminal Company was incorporated February 8, 1898 to begin the project. Major changes needed to be made to the planned area for the buildings, requiring new city ordinances. Ordinances to change the streets and clear area for building were approved in November 6, 1903. An additional ordinance was required to create the bridge over Cabot Way that holds the road (Terminal Way) which runs between the two major buildings. Contractual agreements were created with the railroads servicing the area in early 1904. They show the intended use and how interconnection with the railroad lines would work and which parties were responsible for the various costs. Construction of the buildings began on July 1, 1904, and was finally completed on May 31, 1906. The total cost of construction was approximately $1.5 million. The building was a prominent piece of early 1900s Pittsburgh architecture. It was the subject of different art works and was featured on post cards. One of the new tenants of the building, City Center Self Storage, has a collection of these historical postcards on display in their office. During World War II, the 6th floor of the building was used to store ammunition and ordinance for the United States Department of War. The facility was in active use for warehouse and transportation until 1963. Marketing brochures from that time promote 868,000 square feet of office and warehouse space available and the availability of a teletype center. In 2006, the building was renamed River Walk Corporate Centre. Upper floors of the West Building have largely been converted into modern office space. Tenants include the Green Building Alliance, and Venture Outdoors. East Building tenants include City Center Self Storage, ProFromGo Internet Marketing, and Harry Giglio Photography. On February 5, 2013, Pennsylvania's Historic Preservation Board unanimously approved Pittsburgh Terminal Properties application for historic status in a listing on the National Register of Historic Places. In 2016, the buildings were bought by McKnight Realty Partners, and is currently being converted into The Highline, a creative and chic office complex with retail on the first floor. It will also include a 521 space parking garage, bike storage, a public fitness center, and green space, which can be used for events.

The monument includes a moat and an island platform on which a modern house has been built. The island was the site of a medieval building. The moat measures between 20 and 30 metres across and is widest at the south west corner where the water soaks away to join a stream. The moat was revetted on the south side but the stonework is destroyed and is bridged on the same side by a modern stone bridge which replaced a timber structure. The rectangular island, measuring 60 metres by 40 metres, encloses an area of and is 0.4 metres above the surrounding land. Archaeological evidence of the medieval buildings will be present on the island and the moat will retain other environmental evidence. A ruined post-medieval farmhouse occupied a third of the island in 1983. The present modern buildings occupying the island are excluded from the scheduling, although the ground beneath them is part of the schedule. History New Hall, in the Park of Tyldesley, close to Damhouse by the Astley, Greater Manchester border, was in existence before 1422 when it belonged to Thomas Tyldesley. The hall and its acres of land was the subject of a feud between the Tyldesleys and the Hultons of Hulton Park which ended in 1422 when Roger Hulton gave up any title he had to Hugh Tyldesley. Its occupant in 1692 was Henry Marsh who was elected overseer of the poor for Tyldesley lower side. It was described as a mansion house in 1716 when it was leased to a widow named Heyes. By 1742 Thomas Smith, a farmer, was tenant. In 1838 the property and its 23 Cheshire acres of land were owned by Lord Francis Edgerton who leased it to John Lawton. The tenant from 1853 to 1872 was Richard Grundy and it acquired the nickname, Dicky Beefs.

Musical development Grundman began in the world of music when he was 12 years old and completed his first composition at the age of 14 while still at school. He started his studies in solfeggio, piano and choir at the Madrid Royal Conservatory with Carmen Ledesma at the department of Professor Joaqu√≠n Soriano. At the beginning of his career, Grundman took part in pop groups where he was the singer, keyboard player, composer and arranger. His song \\"Yo lo intentar√≠a una vez m√°s\\" appeared in 1983 on Spanish FM radio charts. He left the musical scene until 1999 when he released \\"The Sons Of The Cold\\", a tune that topped the New Age charts on the old MP3.com site. From this moment on and due to the popularity of the Payback for Playback program that MP3.com was running, Grundman started to collect funds with his music for Doctors Without Borders. He founded a record label named Non Profit Music and later a foundation with the same name, destined to promote contemporary consonant musicFanfare, issue 33-4, March/April 2010 and to collect funds for humanitarian causes. His works have been performed and broadcast mainly in the United States, Canada, London, France, Japan, Brazil and Spain. Performers There are many soloists and ensembles which have performed the music of Grundman such as Brodsky Quartet, Ara Malikian, Arb√≥s Tr√≠o, Daniel del Pino, Susana Cord√≥n, Jir√≠ B√°rta, B3 Classic Trio, Sydney Contemporary Orchestra, The Winchester Orchestra of San Jos√©, Orquesta Sinf√≥nica Nacional of Ecuador, Orquesta de C√°mara de Espa√±a or Non Profit Music Chamber Orchestra. His pieces have been premiered in music halls such as Carnegie Hall, Berliner Philharmoniker, Auditorio Nacional de M√∫sica of Madrid, Teatro de la Zarzuela of Madrid, Teatro Nacional of Brasilia, Trinity Cathedral of California, West Valley College Theater or Iglesia La Dolorosa of Quito, among others. Style The music Grundman writes does not belong to any avant-garde style. Closer to tonal music than neo-romantic, his music is predominantly emotive due to his extensive use of tonal and consonant minor chords. In his childhood days he was a member of several pop groups in Spain and later he turned his compositional attention to new-age music. He has also written music for film and TV shows, and in the classical scene he makes a fusion of all these elements with his personal touch. His music has been compared with Sir Malcolm Arnold,ClassicsToday, Four Sad Seasons Over Madrid, NPM 0903, 2009 Federico Mompou or even the film composer John Barry.MusicWeb International, \\"No Seasons\\", 2009 In an interview with Phillip Scott for Fanfare Magazine, Grundman talks about the consonant music he writes: \\"...In the second half of the 20th century, many composers preferred to write for a small group of individuals and lost contact with the broader audience. The idea of music as a communicative art got ignored. Yet music is the only art that does not exist until it is performed. To achieve its maximum potential, the composer, the performer, and the audience have to speak the same language. In many countries, that cerebral approach to composing is now being forgotten and composers are returning to consonant music. By the way, I don‚Äôt mean consonant simply in its harmonic sense, but in the sense that all participants of the musical experience‚Äîcomposer, performer, and audience‚Äîare on the same level...\\". Also, his music has been featured in the magazine Sinfon√≠a VirtualVirtual Symphony, issue No. 24, January 2013, ISSN 1886-9505. http://www.sinfoniavirtual.com/revista/024/jorge_grundman_fenomenologia_concertante.php labeling it as \\"Fenomenolog√≠a Concertante\\". Recent works In April 2011 Grundman is commissioned by the XVII Festival Internacional de M√∫sica of ToledoForum Clasico http://www.forumclasico.es/RITMOOnLine/MusicaViva/tabid/61/ID/288/XVII- Festival-Internacional-de-Musica-de-Toledo.aspx and writes his sonata for flute and piano called Warhol in Springtime. According to the sheet music this music was made like a collage of Andy Warhol Pop art pictures and must have a duration of 15 minutes, as a tribute to the Warhol famous sentence. On the other hand, his sonata for violin and piano, What Inspires Poetry, dedicated to the composer Marjan Mozetich, is broadcast on many American radio stations. Grundman in 2011 dedicated to the Ukrainian pianist and composer Nikolai Kapustin A Walk across Adolescence for violin, cello and piano, and the composer accepted the dedication of Grundman's work. The piece was premiered that same year at Toledo, Ja√©n, Badajoz, Madrid and many other sites by Daniel del Pino, Roman Patocka and Jir√≠ B√°rta or the Tr√≠o Arb√≥s, which has been recently recorded it for Play it Again, the last recording by the Arb√≥s Trio.

The rebellion lasted from 21 February to 25 March 1917. Background In October 1915, Kingdom of Serbia, which had throughout fall 1914 managed to withstand and repel three Austro-Hungarian invasions, found itself under attack again. This time it was a joint Austro-Hungarian, German, and Bulgarian invasion from two directions that included Austro-Hungarian Third Army, German Eleventh Army, and Bulgarian First and Second armies. Outnumbered and outmatched, the Serbian Army was defeated by December 1915. However, rather than surrendering and capitulating, the Serbian military and political leaders decided on a long and arduous army retreat south towards Albania in hopes of reaching the Adriatic coast for evacuation and regrouping. As a result, the invading Central Powers forces occupied the entire territory of the Kingdom of Serbia. In the immediate division of spoils, Kingdom of Bulgaria got the area of Pomoravlje, which had been a target of Bulgarian nationalism. Prelude The primary cause for the rebellion was the policies passed by the occupiers. Constant denationalization, including closing Serbian schools, prohibition of the Serbian language and traditions, and burning of books, and looting, requisition, internment, provoked the population. Romania entering the war in August 1916 awakened hope in the Serbian population of a breakthrough of the Salonika Front, some arming themselves and taking to the forests. Kosta Vojinoviƒá began the organization of resistance, and in the summer of 1916 established a band in Leposaviƒá, the core of the future Ibar‚ÄìKopaonik Detachment. At the end of September 1916, the Serbian High Command sent Kosta Peƒáanac, reserve infantry lieutenant and veteran Chetnik vojvoda, by airplane into Toplica. He was given the task to establish a secret resistance organization to be activated when the Allies and the Serbian Army break the Salonika Front and arrive at Skoplje. The peak of Serbian discontent came with the Bulgarian announcement of conscription of local Serbs aged 18‚Äì50 for military service. Massive flights to the mountains from Bulgarian recruit commissions began. The first armed conflicts began on 20 February between fleeing conscripts and Bulgarian chases. Peƒáanac and Vojinoviƒá established headquarters on Mount Kopaonik. The decision for this rebellion was taken and on February 21, near the Toplica river the rebellion broke out. Uprising Kosta Peƒáanac in the Toplica district. Chetnik commanders surrendering to Bulgarian commander Tane Nikolov after the rebellion. Toplica Uprising 2017 post stamp of Serbia The rebellion included the areas of Toplica, Jablanica, Jastrebac, eastern and central parts of Kopaonik. The rebels liberated Kur≈°umlija (27 February), Lebane (1 March), Prokuplje (3 March) and Blace (5 March). Having broke out in the Toplica region, the rebellion expanded into territories on the right bank of the West Morava (Vlasotince, Crna Trava, Vranje area), and in the West Morava valley, included the Sokobanja and Svrljig areas. On March 12, the Bulgarian counter-attack started under the command of Alexander Protogerov involving IMRO forces led by Tane Nikolov.Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Macedonia, Dimitar Bechev, Scarecrow Press, 2009 , p. 10. Bulgarian and Austro-Hungarian authorities worked together. IMRO commander and Bulgarian officer Todor Aleksandrov orchestrated the most violent actions committed by Bulgarian paramilitary. After several days of fighting, the Bulgarians entered Prokuplje on 14 March and the Austro-Hungarians entered Kur≈°umlija on 16 March. As of 25 March, the order there was fully restored. In the battles, several thousand people were killed, including civilians. In April 1917, Peƒáanac with his guerrillas, attacked a railway station. On May 15, Peƒáanac entered the old Bulgarian border and invaded Bosilegrad, which was burned. Then his band withdrew to Kosovo, controlled then by the Austro-Hungarians. The Allies opened a new front at Salonika in June but the Serbian Army was unable to break through the Bulgarian lines. After reemerging again for a short time, in September ‚Äì October 1917 Peƒáanac again disappeared. In October 1917 the Austro-Hungarian command created entirely Albanian paramilitary detachments to capture the rest of the Serbian rebels into the mountains and in December 1917, Kosta Vojinoviƒá was killed.

They were created to circumvent UK legislation, called the \\"Sixteeners Laws\\", aimed at taking young motorcycle riders off the road. The new laws, introduced in 1971 by Conservative Party Minister for Transport John Peyton, forbade 16-year-olds from riding motorcycles of capacity, thus limiting them to 50 cc machines until they turned 17. Description The law resulted in motorcycle manufacturers developing a new class of high-performance mopeds in the 1970s, termed \\"sports mopeds\\" or, colloquially, \\"sixteener specials,\\" due to their marketing being aimed at 16-year-olds, a move which was widely criticized at the time.Letters; Saving Fuel, New Scientist, 4 November 1976.

Veloce Publishing Ltd, 14 June 2006 If the speed limiter is removed, a four-stroke engine sport-moped can exceed , while those with two-stroke engines can reach speeds of over . To achieve higher performance, motorcyclists frequently modify the engines, such as installing a big bore kit which raises the displacement. These engine modifications may increase maximum speeds to between . Sport bikes with 125 cc displacements are sometimes registered as 50 cc mopeds to avoid certain state or federal regulations. Because of this, many manufacturers use identical frames and components in both 125 cc sport bikes and 50 cc sport mopeds, allowing a 125 cc engine to be swapped into a 50 cc sport moped frame. Examples of this are the Aprilia RS50 and RS125, the Derbi GPR50 and GPR125, the Yamaha TZR50 and TZR125, and the Gilera DNA 50 and 125. Some sport bikes use the Minarelli AM6 engine (2T) (Aprilia RS 50 (1999-2005), Rieju RS2 Matrix 50, Peugeot XR6, Yamaha TZR 50, Malaguti Drakon 50), while other use Piaggio engines (Derbi GPR 50, and Gilera DNA). Few sport bikes, for example: Gilera DNA and Kingway Fennari were produced with an automatic gearbox. Bicycle-style pedals were installed when new legislation was passed requiring them. These models were produced from 1972 onwards by Japanese manufacturers Honda, Yamaha, and Suzuki, as well as European companies such as Puch, Fantic, Gilera, Gitane, and Garelli.

Biography  Born in Guangzhou (formerly called Canton), Guangdong, China, he was the sixth of seven children. His family relocated to Hong Kong within months of his birth. His father, a businessman, died when Yau was only five years old. He attended secondary school in Buddhist Wong Fung Ling College and St. Paul's Co- educational College in Hong Kong, before entering University of Hong Kong Faculty of Medicine to study medicine. Not wanting to be a physician, however, he departed for the United States in 1968 after only one year of medical study. He received an A.B. in physics (University Scholar) from Princeton in 1971 and a Ph.D. in neurobiology from Harvard in 1975, completing his doctoral thesis under John G. Nicholls, a former student of Bernard Katz. He did postdoctoral work with Denis A. Baylor at Stanford University, and then with Sir Alan L. Hodgkin at University of Cambridge, United Kingdom. Thereafter, he was on the faculty of University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston (1981‚Äì86), rising to Professor of Physiology and Biophysics in 1985. In 1986, he became Professor of Neuroscience and Investigator of Howard Hughes Medical Institute (1986-2004) at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, where he has been since.  Scientific contributions  He is known for discoveries on how light and odor are sensed in the eye and the nose, triggering neural signals to be transmitted to the brain. He has greatly elucidated the properties of the light responses and their underlying phototransduction mechanisms in retinal rods and cones, as well as in intrinsically- photosensitive retinal ganglion cells which express the photopigment, melanopsin, to mediate mostly non-image vision such as pupillary light reflex and photoentrainment of the circadian rhythm. He has made similarly important discoveries on olfactory transduction in the receptor neurons of the nasal olfactory epithelium. His work impacts broadly on understanding G-protein signaling at a quantitative level. His investigations on the spontaneous activity of rod and cone pigments have provided a physicochemical explanation for why our vision does not extend into Infrared wavelengths. He is a Member of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine, and a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Selected honors & awards  * 1978, Alfred P.

Life  Voskan Martikian was born in Erzincan to Armenian parents. At a young age, he moved to Constantinople to receive higher learning. After receiving his education, he rose through the Ottoman ranks of government and held numerous posts in the Ottoman government and ministries. He headed the Ottoman Post-Telegraph Service and introduced many reforms that found much opposition. After the governmental elections of the Ottoman parliament, he was elected as member of parliament. Nationalist editor Huseyin Cahit Bey of the newspaper Tanin slandered Martikian claiming that he had drafted the new Ottoman banknotes to an Armenian and that cryptic Armenian codes were contained in its print. An Ottoman commission investigated the accusations and rebuffed the slanders against Martikian. However, his reputation was severely damaged as a trustworthy politician amongst the Young Turks. At the start of the First World War in 1914, when the Ottoman Parliament was debating whether it should join the war, Martikian made no secret of his disapproval of entry. This created a further rift between the Ottoman authorities and himself. Under much pressure, he resigned from his seat in the parliament. In 1918, Voskan Martikian traveled to Europe and became an auditor at various universities. The newly formed Iraqi government invited Martikian to serve and he was awarded the title of ‚Äúbey‚Äù.

Early military career and personal life Born in Alexandria at the end of the 19th Century, Halim was educated in Germany and fought with the German air force during the First World War, becoming a fighter pilot.Goldschmidt p.69 He later joined the Ottoman air force. After returning to Egypt, Halim founded boxing and sports clubs, led an Egyptian automobile club, and participated in safari hunting.Bidwell, 2012, p.2 Michel Antoine Mamlouk recounts that Halim had three children, Mohamed Ali, Ulvia and Nevine, who were educated in Virginia and Pennsylvania, and that Halim owned the Khedivial Mail Line fleet.Mamlouk, 2010, p.80 Political activism in Egypt Halim joined the Wafd Party and fought with his cousin King Fuad I, while also opposing prime minister Isma'il Sidqi's constitutional reforms in 1930. In December 1930 Halim became president of the Egyptian National Federation of Trade Unions, where he fought for improved working and living conditions for the Egyptian working class. King Fuad crossed his name from the list of royal family members after he published a pamphlet stating that the dismissal of democratically elected leaders could cause civil war in Egypt. Halim's association with the Wafd Party was strained in 1931 when he proposed the formation of an Egyptian labor party, though he later reached an agreement with Wafd leader Mustafa el-Nahhas. Following Sidqi's replacement by Abdel Fattah Yahya Ibrahim Pasha Halim redoubled his efforts to organize Egyptian workers, leading to his imprisonment in 1934, which he protested with a hunger strike. His hunger strike led to widespread workers protests and his release. Halim tried to organize a strike at the Misr Spinning and Weaving Company in El-Mahalla El-Kubra in 1936.Beinin, 2001, pp.106-107 He left politics later that year, returning the next year and attempting to lead The Committee to Organize the Workers' Movement. He later let the Cairo Tramway Workers' Union and helped organize the Join Transport Federation. According to historian Joel Beinin, Halim and the Wafd both viewed trade union struggles within Egypt as part of a larger nationalist political movement, and not as a political struggle by the working class against class society more broadly. As class conflict intensified in Egypt and the popularity of the Communist Party increased, Halim saw his own influence and that of the nationalist trade unions decline.Beinin, 1988, pp.208-223 Halim was arrested for two years by the British in the 1940s, though Halim later said that British Ambassador Killaern had at one point asked if the British should appoint him King.Flower, 2002, pp.142-3 British officials called Halim \\"very popular but obstinate and stupid.\\" Halim was sentenced to 15 years in prison after the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 by the Gamal Abdel Nasser government. While his property was confiscated from him for a time, it was returned in 1975.

When used as a pigment it contains a high Chroma and excellent hiding power. In nature, bismuth vanadate can be found as the mineral pucherite, clinobisvanite, and dreyerite depending on the particular polymorph formed. Its synthesis was first recorded in a pharmaceutical patent in 1924 and began to be used readily as a pigment in the mid-1980s. Today it is manufactured across the world for pigment use. Properties Most commercial bismuth vanadate pigments are now based on pure bismuth vanadate with monoclinic (clinobisvanite) or tetragonal (dreyerite) structure though in the past two phase systems involving a 4:3 relationship between bismuth vanadate and bismuth molybdate (Bi2MoO6) have been used. In the monoclinic phase, BiVO4 is an n-type photoactive semiconductor with a bandgap of 2.4 eV, which has been investigated for water splitting after doping with W and Mo. BiVO4 photoanodes have demonstrated record solar-to- hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiencies of 5.2% for flat films and 8.2% for WO3@BiVO4 core-shell nanorods (highest for metal-oxide photo-electrode) with the advantage of a very simple and cheap material. Production While most CICPs are formed exclusively through solid state, high temperature calcination, bismuth vanadate can be formed from a series of pH controlled precipitation reactions (it is important to note these reactions can be carried out with or without the presence of molybdenum depending on the desired final phase). It is also possible to start with the parent oxides (Bi2O3 and V2O5) and perform a high temperature calcination to achieve a pure product.Sulivan, R. European Patent Application 91810033.0, 1991.

He reportedly murdered 964 individuals starting in his youth over a 13-year period, from 1568 until his capture in 1581.Herber, p. 1-2.Wiltenburg ch 1, 2012 The story of Christman Genipperteinga is contained in a contemporary pamphlet from 1581. As early as in 1587, just 6 years after its publication, at least one chronicler included the story as factual.Hondorff, Sturm (1587), p.333‚Äì34 Similar tales circulated about robbers with names such as Lippold, Danniel, G√∂rtemicheel, Schwarze Friedrich, Henning, Klemens, Vieting and Paped√∂ne. The tale of Paped√∂ne is particularly relevant, since a version of that story is contained in a book published in 1578, 3 years before Genipperteinga's alleged death.  Origins  Christman Genipperteinga came from Kerpen,Kirschslager, 2007 two miles (\\"zwo Meylen\\") southwest of Cologne.  Lair  For about seven years Christman lived in a cave/mine complex some distance (\\"ein gro√üe Meyl\\") away from Bergkessel (possibly Bernkastel-Kues), in a wooded upland/mountain area called Frassberg. From there, he had a good view over the roads going between Trier, Metz, Dietenhoffen and L√ºtzelburger Landt. The cave complex is described as being very cleverly built, just like an ordinary house inside, with cellars, rooms and chambers, with all the household goods that ought to belong in a house.  Criminal activity and methods  Historian Joy Wiltenburg identifies two important, occasionally overlapping, patterns of crime reports relative to serial killers in Early Modern Germany: * Reports on robber-killersFor a batch of such cases, see, for example Schultz (2011), p.397-398 * Reports on witches (for example: mid- wives) or cannibals targeting infants or even fetuses cut out of their mothers' wombs for use of their body parts in feasting or in rituals of black magic. Genipperteinga fits pattern 1, hoarding his ill-gotten gains in his cave.Herber, page 3 As Wiltenburg further remarks, however: Furthermore, in contrast with the reports of other robber killers from that time, like those of Peter Nyersch and Jacob Sumer, depictions of supernatural abilities and/or contracts with the devil are absent from the 1581 account of Christman. He is also definitely reported as guilty of multiple infanticides, but the account from 1581 does not connect this with practice of black magic or cannibalism. Christman preyed upon both German and French travelers. It was said that a party of 3, 4, or even 5 travellers might not be safe from him. Nor was he averse to double-crossing his own partners in crime in order to get his hands on the whole booty, rather than his \\"just share\\". Once they had helped bring the loot to his cave, he served them poisoned food or drink, with rarely anyone surviving beyond 5 hours. He is said to have thrown their bodies into a mine shaft connected with his cave complex.Herber, page 4  Sex slave  Shortly after he took up residence at Frassberg, Christman met an intended victim, the young daughter of a cooper in Popert. She was traveling to Trier to meet her brother. He changed his mind and ordered her under death threats to come and live with him. He made her swear she would never betray him, and for the next 7 years, she served his sexual wants. Whenever he went out to find new victims, he bound her with a chain so that she could not escape. He fathered 6 children with her but at birth he killed them, pressing in their necks (original: \\"hat er den Kindern das Genick eingedr√ºckt\\").Herber, p. 3-4. Christman used to hang up their bodies, and stretched them out (orig: \\"aufgeh√§ngt und ausgedehnt\\"). As the wind made the little corpses move, he said:  Downfall  Christman finally relented to the woman's repeated pleadings that she might be allowed to meet other people, and granted her expressed wish to visit Bergkessel under condition of a renewed oath not to betray him. But once there, seeing the little children running about in the streets, she had a breakdown, and went down on her knees in lamentation: And she began to wail and weep bitterly. Many commiserated with her, but when anyone asked her about what her troubles were, she refused to reveal them. Brought before the mayor, she was urged to tell her story, and assured by many learned men, by reference to Scripture, that if it was a matter of life and the soul, then she ought to confess. She then confessed everything she knew. In order to catch Christman off guard, the following scheme was hatched: She was given a sack of peas, and with these, she marked the way to the cave complex.Herber, page 6 On 27 May 1581, 30 armed men set out to capture him. He was asleep when they came, because she had made him relax with gentle words while she deloused his hair. As the armed men barged in, Christman cried out: \\"Oh, you faithless betrayer and whore, had I known this, I would have strangled you long ago\\". Within Christman's cave complex, an immense amount of booty was found, in the form of wine,Herber, page 2 dried and/or salted meat, suits of armour, firearms and other weaponry, trade goods, coin and other valuables. The value was estimated as exceeding 70,000 Gulden. The author of the 1581 Herber account notes that one might well have made a full year's market out of the booty found in Christman's cave.  Confession, trial and execution  Woodcut print showing a breaking wheel similar to the type used on Genipperteinga Christman kept a diary in which he detailed the murders of 964 individuals, as well as a tally of the loot gained from them. The diary was found among his possessions. In addition to this evidence Christman readily admitted to the murders, adding that if he had reached his goal of a thousand victims, he would have been satifisfied with that number. On 17 June 1581Heber, page 1 Christman Genipperteinga was found guilty, and was condemned to death by the breaking wheel. He endured nine days on the wheel prior to expiring, kept alive in his sufferings with strong drink every day, so that his heart would be strengthened.  Depiction  Front page of Caspar Herber's 1581 account of Christman Genipperteinga The primary source regarding Christman Genipperteinga is a pamphlet published by Caspar Herber in 1581, Erschr√∂ckliche newe Zeytung Von einem M√∂rder Christman genandt (\\"Terrible, new tidings about a murderer named Christman\\"). The publisher of the pamphlet is credited on the title page to come from Lochem an der Mussel. Bergkessel is referred to as \\"our town\\" (\\"unsere Stadt\\") in the text. At the time of the pamphlet's end of writing, the loot from Christman's cave as well as his woman were kept at a certain location, the fates of both undecided. The tale was reprinted in full, with some editing and modernizing of language, by the antiquarian Johann Scheible in 1847.Scheible, 1847  Literary and social context  The historian Joy Wiltenburg, in Crime and Culture in Early Modern Germany (2012) performed a close study of the popular crime reports from the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Her primary aims are to investigate where and how such works were produced, who had authored them, who read and collected such reports, and what particular crimes were principal concerns in these works, and how such questions may have had different answers for different times. Only tangentially does she seek to probe the authenticity of the individual, conserved crime reports, that is, resolving the problem of how the discourse of crime accurately, or inaccurately, portrayed actual crime on the local scale. As noted by her,Wiltenburg ch 1, 2012 concerning Early Modern Germany, it was in the 1570s that reports of robber bands multiplied, reaching a peak in the 1580s. Furthermore, she observes:Wiltenburg Intr, 2012 The story of Christman Genipperteinga belongs therefore, in a literary and social context in which such reports were particularly frequent, relative to immediately preceding or succeeding periods, and should be interpreted with that in mind. For example, as Wiltenburg points out, the peak in report survival from the 1580s is partially explained by the 1588 death of report collector Johann Wick, whereas the historical context from other sources does not yield evidence for a comparable decline of crime in the 1590s relative to the 1580s. A contemporary witness who confirms the large increase in such reports was the preacher Leonhard Breitkopf. In a sermon from 1591, he wrote:Janssen, Christie (1907), p.271 Although Wiltenburg acknowledges that there may well have been an increase in crime in the latter quarter of the sixteenth century, she cautions a framing and delimiting of that increase, with respect to murders in particular, relative to the immediately preceding 16th century, rather than stretching it much further back in time. In particular, one cannot say, with any degree of certainty, that there were more homicides committed in the Early Modern Age than in Late Medieval times. For example, she states: One important reason behind this discrepancy, apart from those connected with how new printing methods enabled more reports on crime to be published relative to earlier periods, is the new role of the Early Modern State in actively pursuing, publicizing and punishing crimes, rather than the passive role of the Medieval State, content with arbitration or mediation between aggrieved parties. If no one actively accused another person for a given injury/crime, then no crime existed in the eyes of the medieval authorities. This passive, accusation-dependent system of justice was gradually replaced with the more active, independently investigative and inquisitorial system of justice in the Early Modern period. Comparing Genipperteinga's time with earlier times, Wiltenburg makes the following pertinent observation relative to the changes in the social composition of the archetypically presented lawless/violent men of previous eras to those from the latter quarter of the 16th century:Wiltenburg ch 1, 2012 A particular urbanite concern in the High/Late Middle Ages were the depredations caused by lawless/feuding nobles: The 16th century contrast to this earlier picture of \\"the lawless noble\\" is borne out by the following observations of Wiltenburg: Thus, the report of Christman Genipperteinga appeared at a time when particular fears of the savage Outsider in the Wild were at their most acute, and when people generally regarded the Criminal as coming primarily from the idle, roaming poor, in contrast to previously primary concerns of haughty, predatory nobles, their brutal, willing henchmen and corrupt magistrates who chose to ignore the crimes committed by the former. However, Wiltenburg cautions against a general, facile dismissal of sixteenth century tales of murder and mayhem (to which genre Genipperteinga's story belongs) as if they merely were to be considered as literary fictions or as pieces of state propaganda:Wiltenburg ch 1, 2012 That being said, it cannot be denied that it was, at this time, a definite trend of sensationalism, and that some wholly untrue stories were produced and sold. In the words of the 19th century German historian Johannes Janssen:Janssen, Christie (1907), p.273 Nor is it only modern historians like Janssen and Wiltenburg who display a measured, if not necessarily wholesale, skepticism towards the actual veracity of crime reports from this time. Already 40 years prior to Genipperteinga's supposed death, in his 1538 Chronica, the humanist and historian Sebastian Franck laments:Janssen, Christie (1907), p.274  Later folklore  Whatever actual truth value attaches to the account of Genipperteinga as related by Caspar Herber, the fact that the pamphlet was published in the same year as Genipperteinga is to have been executed, necessitates the view that Herber's account is among the earliest sources for the story about him in particular. Furthermore, within just a few years after the publication of the story in 1581, it was included as factual in calendars and annals, like those of Vincenz Sturm and Joachim von Wedel. Herber's account is, however, not the only telling of the tale that has circulated, and in this section a review will be given how the story has mutated throughout time, by noting deviations in them, relative to Herber's. ;Christian Gnipperdinga In Vincenz Sturm's (1587) continuation of Andreas Hondorff's \\"Calendarium Sanctorum et historiarum\\", in his entry for 17 June, the verdict of the murderer Christian Gnipperdinga is recorded as one of those significant events happening on that date. Some minor variant details occur relative to Herber, like the murderer's name, that \\"Burgkessel\\" was \\"zwo Meylen\\" distant from Cologne, that the booty was on 7000 Gulden (rather than 70.000), and that the maiden is said to be from Burgkessel, rather than from Boppard, and was on her way to Cologne, rather than to Trier when Gnipperdinga met her. Apart from that, Sturm's account is merely a condensation of the pamphlet, which he notes was printed in Mainz.Hondorff, Sturm (1587), p.333‚Äì34 or Hondorff, Sturm (1599), p.471‚Äì72 ;Christoff Grippertenius Joachim von Wedel:de:Joachim von Wedel was a Pomeranian gentleman who wrote the annals of the most significant events in Pomerania of his time. He saw fit, however, to include sufficiently remarkable events from elsewhere. In his entry for 1581, a short notice of Christoff Grippertenius is included, with no geographical details given, but asserting that the 6 infants killed were in addition to the 964, an interpretation not forbidden by Herber's account, but not directly cited from it.von Wedel, p.283 ;Christoff Gnippentennig In his 1597 manuscript, Julius Sperber:de:Julius Sperber noted that Christoff Gnippentennig at Bergkesel murdered 964 people in addition to six of his own children.Sperber (1660), p.163 ;Christmann Gropperunge, the cannibal Johann Becherer, in his (1601) \\"Newe Th√ºringische Chronica\\", is an early source on cannibalism, stating that Christman Gropperunge von Kerpen ate the hearts of his infants. That feature is absent from Herber's account. Furthermore, \\"Frassberg\\" has become \\"Frossberg\\", and from the height above his lair, Christman is said to be able to view the roads to Saarbr√ºcken, Zweybr√ºck, Simmern, Creutzenach and Bacharach, in addition to those mentioned by Herber.Becherer (1601) p.590-91 Martin Zeiller, in his 1661 \\"Miscelllania\\" has Becherer as explicit source for his own brief notice, rather than Herber.Zeiller (1661), p.303 In an earlier, 1640 work Martin Zeiller notes the existence of a small pamphlet concerning an unnamed murderer at an unnamed place who killed 964 persons, erronously dating this to 1580, Zeiller (1640), p.232 In his 1695 account, von Ziegler und Kliphausen:de:Heinrich Anselm von Ziegler und Kliphausen repeats Becherer's account, including the eating of the infants' hearts, lacking from Zeiller.von Ziegler und Kliphausen (1695), p.713 ;Christman Gnippertringa In the 1606 continuation of Johannes Stumpf's \\"Schweytzer Chronick\\", it is noted that over a period of 30 years, a Christman Gnippertringa had killed a total of 964 people (no mention of cannibalism).Stumpf (1606), p. cxxxi ;Christman Grepperunge In this 1606 publication by Georg Nigrinus and Martin Richter, it is noted that the woman made the decision to betray Grepperunge, in revenge for her dead children, the moment she managed to get free of him (no cannibalism noted).Nigrinus, Richter (1606), p.62 ;The arch-cannibal is born In this 1707 publication, Christian Gnipperdinga (or Gropperunge) is, for the first time credited with eating his victims in general, not only his own children. It is said that over a great area, he had hidden away his lair with great rocks, so that nobody would ever think anyone could live in that rock desert. In the city, the girl is promised by the authorities to receive a pension for life, if she betrays Gnipperdinga. It is further stated that she brought back from Bergkessel a bottle of extremely strong wine, and Gnipperdinga falls asleep, as planned, from drinking that wine.(1707)p.89‚Äì92 ; \\"Murderers!\\", the cannibal screamed Johann Joseph Pock, in his (1710) \\"Alvearium Curiosarum Scientiarum\\" furnishes basically a mixture of earlier accounts (including the eating of his infants' hearts), although he states that the young maiden wanted to visit friends in Trier, rather than her brothers. The most significant new element occurring in Pock is that with his dying breath, Christian Gnipperdinga screamed that he was murdered.Pock (1710), p.338‚Äì39 ;Christmann Gopperunge In this publication from 1712 by Johann Gottfried Gregorii, averring as its source is Becherer (1601), a strangely merciful execution is meted out, namely beheading, rather than being broken on the wheel.Gregorii (1712), p.551 ;Christian Gropperunge Referring to a recent French case of a highwayman found guilty of 28 murders, the author of the 1731 \\"Schau-Spiegel europ√§ischer Thaten oder Europ√§ische Merckw√ºrdigkeiten\\" offers a batch of similar cases, including that of Christian Gropperunge (without any of the exotic details already circulating, just the numbers and general locations)Sturm (1731), p.63 ;A filthy, stinking cave In his 1734 \\"Seraphisch Bu√ü- und Lob-anstimmendes Wald-Lerchlein\\", Klemens Harderer basically follows the 1707 account, interspersing it with digressions of cannibals in general, and the sin of drinking wine. Adding to his source document, he says the cave was stinking from human flesh, filled with human bones, and the girl (here called Amarina) is force-fed human flesh herself.Harderer (1734), p.32‚Äì39 ;A nameless cannibal's cave In an oblique reference in this 1736 publication, the details of year, location and numbers are getting rather hazy, and what is remembered is that the cave contained lots of weapons, along with human bones and skulls.Burghart (1736), p.90 ;Dorothea Teichner and Gnippordinga By the nineteenth century, more polished fairy tales had developed in the Rhineland area about the terrible murderer who once roamed there. One of those tales is about the pious maiden Dorothea Teichner, who is unlucky enough to meet the murderer Gnippordinga. Much conversation is added relative to the original in Herber. She cannot understand how she can be his wife, because there is no priest present. Gnippordinga merely laughs, and says the green woods are priest good enough. Years go by, and even more infant skeletons fill up the branches of an old tree. And Dorothea weeps every time when the wind moves them clattering about, while Gnippordinga taunts her and says: \\"What are you whining about? Our children are dancing and playing, so stop crying!\\" One day, when he comes back severely wounded, he sends her off to Burgkastel, to fetch medicine. She breaks down in front of a statue of Mother Mary, and bemoans all the horrors she has endured. She is insensible of the people gathering around her, so she didn't consciously break her vows to Gnippodinga. Once he is lying on the wheel, his bones all broken and dangling from the wheel, his cries of pain when the wind moves them are met with the executioner's scornful words: \\"What are you whining about? Your bones are dancing and playing, so stop crying!\\"Schanz (1855), p.94 A roughly similar version is contained in Flora (1820), p.303 Furthermore, in the leftover material from the Brothers Grimm, the tale of the R√§uber Gnipperdinga seems to be included, Breslau (1997), p.596 ;Gniperdoliga, practitioner of the Black Arts In none of the above given versions is there any mention of Genipperteinga making contracts with the devil, or having magical powers. However, the story of \\"Christman Gniperdoliga\\"/\\"Groperunge aus Kerpen\\" is also the basis of a \\"Moritat\\", or \\"Murderer's Ballad\\", typically performed at inns, fairs and markets. The content within that ballad, as retold by KirschlagerExecerpt at Kirschlager do include such points as well, in that Gniperdoliga's cave was originally made by the dvarwes, and that he could make himself invisible by means of the Black Arts. In addition, the Moritat says Gniperdoliga was apprenticed under contemporary serial killer Peter Niers, having been his companion for 2 years. Finally, the Morit√§t says that the booty from Gniperdoliga's was divided between a hospital and the poor, his erstwhile \\"mistress\\" receiving a share as well. Alternate tales A number of other fairy tales and folksongs are concerned, however, with the theme of the robber living in a cave shaped like a house, who kept a fair maiden captive, but who eventually escapes and betrays him. There are several alternate tales of Christman Genipperteinga, under alternate names, or have deviations from the original 1581 account.  Lippold and the Lippoldsh√∂hle  About 2 km southwest of Brunkensen, now in the town Alfeld in Lower Saxony, lies a cave that at least from the mid-17th century has gone by the name Lippoldsh√∂hle.:de:Lippoldsh√∂hle Writing in 1654, Martin Zeiller notes that there, \\"several hundred years ago\\", a robber named Lippold and his band had created their home, having made both a kitchen and stable there. Amongst other atrocities, they were rumoured to have kidnapped several young women, and strangled at birth the children they had with the women.Merian, Zeiller (1654), p.61 Another version of the tale identifies Lippold as a Count Lippold of Wrisberg, who at one point assaulted a wedded couple, killed the man and kidnapped the bride, and kept her as a slave for several years. At one point, she was allowed to go to Alfeld, bemoaned her fate at a stone at the council house, and this led eventually to Lippold's downfall.Schambach, M√ºller (1948), p.69-71 According to yet another telling, the stone at the council house was originally red, but turned dark blue when she told the stone her harrowing tale. The stone is, reputedly, still there, and is depicted in the Alfeld's weapon shield. In this rendering, there was a hole in the roof of Lippold's cave, so that after he had fallen asleep in the maiden's lap while she was delousing him, the citizens let down a rope with a noose through the hole. The maiden fixed the noose around Lippold's neck, and he was strangled as the citizens pulled the rope up. Another version of his death is also given here, that the girl did not return at all, and that the citizens drowned Lippold by pouring water down the hole.Kuhn, Schwartz (1848), p. 249‚Äì250 Apart from the connotation of the Lippoldsh√∂hle as having been the den of a terrible murderer, some have pointed out that in the 13th and 14th century, the cave lay in the territory of the R√∂ssing family of nobles, many of them having as their first name Lippold.Zeitschrift Hist. Verein Niedersachsen (1860), p. 196‚Äì197  The robbers Danniel and G√∂rtemicheel  Wolfgang Menzel (1858) furnishes a number of other folktales similar in content to the pamphlet concerning Christman Genipperteinga in his chapter \\"Fairy tales concerning the long suffering maidens\\".This entire paragraph is based on Menzel (1858), p.149‚Äì160 The robber Danniel, whose brother was a smith and had helped him build his cave, was fond of abducting fair maidens. One of them had to live with him for seven years, but managed to flee, and was clever enough to distribute peas along the road, so that he was, eventually, caught. The robber G√∂rtemicheel abducted a maiden, had seven children with her. She betrayed him on an errand to town, confessing her woes to a stone, and chose to mark the trail to the cave with peas. When returning, however, her tears suddenly flowed, and the robber understood that she betrayed him. As vengeance, he chose to decapitate their children, and hang the woman from a tree.  Schwarze Friedrich, Henning and Klemens  In 1661, the robber Schwarze Friedrich (Frederick the Black) met his fate close to Liegnitz, now Legnica. The elements of the murdered children and the song are lacking, but yet again, a maiden is held captive, marks the way to the robber's cave by peas, and confess her woes to a stone.Gr√§sse (1871), p.192 The same basic scheme is found concerning the tales of robber Henning, whose reputed lair, the Henningsh√∂hle,:de:Henningsh√∂hle close by Treffurt in Thuringia which until the 1960s could be visited, but is now collapsed.A Henning-tale can be found in Volkmar (2011), p.90‚Äì91 Close by the town Pritzwalk, the robber Klemens is to have had his lair and a captive maiden. She has also been extracted a vow never to betray him, but unbeknownst to her, when she bewails her fate to an oven, somebody who had hidden himself within it overheard her, and Klemens was caught.Gr√§sse (1868), p.103  The robber Vieting  First attested in 1670 by Michael Cordesius,For Cordesius, see for example Archiv f√ºr Landeskunde (1859), p.427 a robber called Vieting is to have lived in the cave Vietingsh√∂hle, in the Sonnenberg forestSonnenberg and R√§uber Vieting near Parchim. In order to alert himself whenever potential victims passed along the road through the forest, Vieting had devised a clever contraption with a thread, so that whenever anyone walked upon it, a small bell just outside his cave opening would ring. Then he could sneak up on the traveller and rob and murder them. One day, the bell rang once more, and Vieting brought his weapons with him, but when he saw the beautiful maiden Hanna walking along the road, singing to herself, he was smitten with desire, and chose, as Genipperteinga did, to order her to live with him as his mistress. Again, Vieting finally relented to let Hanna go to town to make some errands, after having sworn not to betray him. On her way back, she confessed her woes to a stone (and unbeknownst to her, several villagers listened in upon her), and in a distraught manner, some of the peas she had brought with her fell to the ground, thereby indicating for the villagers where they could find the murderer who had terrorized the region for so long. Vieting is caught and executed, and Hanna lives happily ever after, once again united with her family and friends.Niederh√∂ffer (1858), p.100  Paped√∂ne  The robber Paped√∂ne, who is to have lived in a cave called Paped√∂ncken-Kuhl close to the village of UtechtOn Utecht and cave name,Kl√ºver (1738), p.293 near Ratzeburg is also said, like G√∂rtemicheel, to have revenged himself on their common children when he understood he had been betrayed by his woman. He killed their two sons, hung them up in a tree, and as the bodies moved with the wind, he sang: In a version from 1738, Paped√∂ncke kills his children at birth, just like Genipperteinga, has their heads fixed along the rope as he sings his verse.Kl√ºver (1738), p.293 In another version of the Paped√∂ne tale, he is said to have been active from 1314‚Äì1322. In this version, he used to hang the skulls of his murder victims from the branches of a tree, and used a rod to strike them to produce a melody, to which he sang the little song cited above. After having murdered six abducted maidens, he grew so fond of the seventh, that he couldn't bear killing her. Taking her once to the city of L√ºbeck, she recognized her brother in the crowd, but didn't speak out.

Title 1 established a uranium mill remedial action program jointly funded by the federal government and the state. Title 1 of the Act also designated 22 inactive uranium mill sites for remediation, resulting in the containment of 40 million cubic yards of low-level radioactive material in UMTRCA Title 1 holding cells.

The act perpetuated the \\"Agreement State\\" program, established in 1959, in which the Atomic Energy Commission gave regulatory authority of certain nuclear materials to states. It was unclear how much regulatory power Agreement states had, and as a result these states took little regulatory action.

After his return to Istanbul in 1853, he joined the Armenian Educational Council, which had been founded the same year. There he met most of the young men who later became known as the Armenian language renewal movement as well as the main protagonists of the Armenian National Constitution.  Political career  In 1866, he became a member of the Mixed Administrative Council of the Armenian millet (Called mixed council because it was composed of Armenian clerics and laymen). His posts within the Armenian community were soon followed by positions in the Ottoman government. In 1860, he was appointed a member of the newly formed Supreme Commercial Court. In 1868, he was appointed vice-minister of Commerce; in 1869‚Äì71, he was a member of the Abkam-i Adliye (Council of Judicial Ordinances); from 1871 on, he was also an advisor in the Sultani. The same year he changed his task as an advisor in the Ministry of Education for a similar post in the Ministry of Public Works, and was the same time appointed to the Reform Commission. In 1873, he changed positions again, going once again to the Ministry of Justice. Two years later he became counselor in the same Ministry, a position he held until the end of his life. In the same year, 1875, he was appointed to the Council of State. In 1876‚Äì77, he served as Minister of Justice. In his capacity as advisor to the president of the Abkam-i Adliye, a post he also acquired in 1876, he was sent to Europe to study legal codes of procedure, which would possibly serve as a model for Ottoman use. Hovhannes Vahanian was also active in literary life, working as a writer in his free time.

The species was described from Miocene-aged fossils found in Canada and the United States of America. It is one of several extinct species placed in the living section Glabra. History and classification Acer traini is represented by a group of fossil specimens from a number of different geologic deposits in western North America. The northernmost fossils have been reported from the Early Miocene Chilcotin River flora of Central British Columbia. Two localities in Oregon have produced fossils of the species. The White Hills site of the Mascall Formation in Northeast Central Oregon and the Trout Creek flora of southeastern Oregon while the Trapper Creek flora found in southern central Idaho is the furthest east locality for the species. Two Early to early Middle Miocene floras in Nevada host A. traini fossils, the Thurston Ranch flora of northeastern Nevada and the southernmost occurrence of the species in the Purple Mountain flora in western central Nevada. The Chilcotin River flora found in preserved infilled paleovalleys overlain by Chilcotin Group flood basalts while the Mascall formation is composed of temporary lake beds interbedded with lava flows of the Columbia River Basalt Group. Only one fossil is known from each locality, with the exception of the Trout Creek flora which produced two fossils, giving a total of only seven specimens. The holotype specimen of the species is number UMMP 65138, housed in the University of Michigan Museum of Paleontology and the paratype is specimen UCMP 9343, in the University of California Museum of Paleontology. The specimens were studied by paleobotanists Jack A. Wolfe of the United States Geological Survey, Denver office and Toshimasa Tanai of Hokkaido University. Wolfe and Tanai published their 1987 type description for A. traini in the Journal of the Faculty of Science, Hokkaido University. The etymology of the chosen specific name traini is in recognition of Percy Train, a fossil collector who amassed large collections of fossils from the Trout Creek flora. Description The samaras of A. traini have an overall nutlet shape which is triangular with an average length between and ranging between wide and are \\"moderately inflated\\" with three distinct ridges. One of the ridges is very distinct, located in the middle of the nutlet and crossing it from the attachment scar to the nutlet tip, the other two are less pronounced. The wing has a length ranging from and a width of . The paired samaras have a 30¬∞‚Äì40¬∞ attachment angle with the wing hosting six distinct veins that start at the nutlet tip and curve from the wing margin, forking three to four times each. Wolfe and Tanai note in the species description that the fossils are the first Tertiary record of an Acer glabrum (Douglas maple)-type fruit in western North America, and further note that no characters separate A. traini fruits from A. glabrum fruits. They suggest that, if fossil leaves are found associated with the fruits which match the living A. glabrum foliage, then A. traini could be considered a synonym of A. glabrum. However, until leaf fossils are found, they suggest the fossils be kept a separate species.

The 350-seat church is no longer in regular use since the island of Helg√∏ya is no longer populated. The last confirmation class at the church was confirmed in 1966. The population of the island decreased steadily until it no longer had permanent residents. Today, the island is used for summer vacation homes and the church is now only used on occasion for special services, including one summer service each year. History The first church at Helg√∏ya was likely built in the late 1400s and was subject to the priest in Troms√∏. The church was later replaced with a church from another location. The building was originally constructed in 1741 in Hemnes in Helgeland. In 1872 it was taken down and moved to Hamn in Berg municipality on Senja island. It was rebuilt there as a church by the nickel plant. When the plant closed in 1888, the church was once again dismantled and moved to Helg√∏ya to replace the earlier church building.

Formation St Andrew's-with-Castle Gate United Reformed Church, Nottingham, was established in 1975 by the union of St Andrew's URC with Castle Gate URC, following the creation of the United Reformed Church by Act of Parliament in 1972.Malcolm V. Jones, The History of St Andrew's with Castle Gate United Reformed Church, Nottingham 1992. Prior to this date, St Andrew's (founded 1870) had been the leading Presbyterian Church in the city and Castle Gate (founded c.1665) the leading Congregational Church. Buildings Following Union, the membership of St Andrew's-with-Castle Gate resolved to retain the former St Andrew's premises on Goldsmith Street, where it still worships and hosts its many other activities, while the Castle Gate premises were acquired by the Congregational Federation (bringing together those Congregational Churches that elected to remain independent on the formation of the URC), for use as its national headquarters. It is now known as The Castle Gate Centre. History Through its different branches, the Church has a long and distinguished history of Christian witness in the city and county. The history of Castle Gate Congregational Church can be traced to the mid-seventeenth century and the period of the English Civil War. A dissenting community of Independents (Congregationalists) first set up a Church in Castle Gate in 1689, while the existing building was opened in 1864.A. R. Henderson, History of Castle Gate Congregational Church Nottingham, 1655-1905, London, 1905; Robert Duce, Castle Gate Church in the Twentieth Century, Nottingham, 1977.

Littlefair, St Andrew‚Äôs Presbyterian Church, Belgrave Square, Nottingham, 1866-1966, Nottingham, 1966. Both Churches assisted in the foundation of daughter churches in the locality in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Castle Gate's included The Boulevard (Gregory Boulevard, 1823), Albion (Sneinton, 1856), Addison Street (1867), Queen's Walk (1874), Park Hill (Derby Road, 1880), Bloomsgrove (Norton Street, 1894), with missions at Thorneywood (1861) and Old Radford (1860-61). Most of these (The Boulevard being a distinguished exception) have now closed or have merged again with their mother churches. St Andrew's, in its turn, established the Hyson Green Mission (Noel Street) in 1885, where a new Church was opened in 1901, to survive until the close of WW2. In 1896, St Columba's was opened on the Mansfield Road, to re-unite with St Andrew's in 1946. The St Ann's Well Road Congregational Church, an independent foundation, united with Castle Gate Congregational Church in 1971, shortly before the majority of Congregational Churches in England and Wales united with the English Presbyterian Church to form the United Reformed Church.

In 2012 he was unbeaten in five races including the Breeders' Cup Juvenile and was awarded American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt at the Eclipse Awards. Background Shanghai Bobby is a dark bay or brown colt bred in Kentucky by Stonehaven Steadings. In September he was sent to the Keeneland sales where he was bought for $105,000 by a representative of Starlight Racing. Jack Wold and Donnie Lucarelli, the owners of Starlight Racing, named the horse after their friend Bob Burton, an airline pilot who often flew to Shanghai. He is trained by the five-time Eclipse Award winner Todd Pletcher and has been ridden in all of his races to date by Rosie Napravnik. Racing career 2012: two-year-old season Shanghai Bobby made his first appearance on April 19 when he won a four and half furlong race at Aqueduct Racetrack. Two months later he ran in the Track Barron Stakes at Belmont Park. Starting the 1/2 favorite, he won by a length from Handsome Jack. Shanghai Bobby's next race was the Grade II Hopeful Stakes at Saratoga Race Course on September 3. He took the lead early in the straight and won by three and three-quarter lengths from the favored Fortify. In October, Shanghai Bobby was moved up to Grade I class for the Champagne Stakes over one mile at Belmont. Starting the 33/20 favorite, he took the lead a quarter mile from the finish and drew clear to win by five lengths from Goldencents. After the race Pletcher praised the colt's versatility and tenacity, saying that he had \\"all the tools\\". For his final start of the year, Shanghai Bobby raced outside New York State for the first time when he was sent to California to contest the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at Santa Anita Park. Starting the 7/4 favorite he raced in second place before taking a clear lead two and a half furlongs from the finish. At the turn into the stretch he appeared to be struggling and was briefly headed, but rallied strongly to win by a head from He's Had Enough. Commenting on the horse's performance, Napravnik, who became only the second woman to ride a Breeders' Cup winner, explained that \\"Bobby gets lost when he's out there by himself\\". 2013: three-year-old season Shanghai Bobby's early targets in 2013 were the Jan. 26 Holy Bull Stakes and the March 30 Florida Derby. On Jan. 26 Shanghai Bobby was the 2/1 favorite for the Holy Bull Stakes. He started quickly and led till the straight when he was overtaken by Itsmyluckyday. He finished the race in second behind Itsmyluckyday by six lengths sustaining the first loss of his career. On March 30, 2013 Shanghai Bobby was the 5/2 favorite for the Besilu Stables Florida Derby at Gulfstream Park. He broke sharp and stalked on the inside until the far turn where he weakened to place 5th behind Orb, Itsmyluckyday, Merit Man, and Narvaez. On March 30, Shanghai Bobby was diagnosed with a pelvic stress fracture. He was sent to a farm in Florida to recover. On September 20, Shanghai Bobby made a comeback in his first start after the injury in the Florida Derby, starting in the Aljamin Stakes at Belmont Park, and winning by a half-length. On September 30, it was announced that Shanghai Bobby had sustained an injury to a suspensory ligament and would be retired from racing. He will reside at Coolmoore Stud's American Breeding Branch, Ashford Stud.

The first president of Czechoslovakia, Tom√°≈° Masaryk, had very limited formal powers, such as representing the country abroad, declaring war, making peace and naming ambassadors. Masaryk wished to implement the American model of a strong presidency, and used his considerable informal authority to obtain more power (e.g. to recall government ministers) and to set up a more- or-less independent political structure centered on himself. The common term used for this structure was \\"the group of the Castle\\", or skupina okolo Hradu in Czech, meaning the Prague Castle, the official seat of the president. The term Hrad (capitalized) was coined by the media and used as a slur by political opponents. Hrad included organizations such as Czechoslovak Unity of Legionnaires (ƒåeskoslovensk√° obec legion√°≈ô≈Ø - soldiers from the Czechoslovak Legions), Legiobanka (a large bank), the Czechoslovak Hussite Church which Masaryk helped to establish, individual entrepreneurs, politicians from several parties and influential journalists like Ferdinand Peroutka and Karel ƒåapek). The group had significant monetary resources available and kept an informal intelligence network. In 1925 they established a new political party (mockingly nicknamed \\"the party of the Castle, Hradn√≠ strana) but it failed in 1925 parliamentary elections and dissolved five years later. The next president, Edvard Bene≈°, tried to follow the direction set by Masaryk and kept Hrad above and outside political parties. After the communist takeover of power in Czechoslovakia in February 1948, the real center of power moved to the Central Committee of the Party and to Moscow. After the Communist party fell from power in 1989, the new president V√°clav Havel tried to use his influence to retain his powers against the rising influence of political parties. His effort failed and Havel's role eventually became mostly ceremonial. The term Hrad had occasionally appeared again in Czech media to label the political movements, parties and individuals centered on Havel. Since they were unsuccessful the term was invariably meant as a mockery. Since the end of World War II Czech historians have used the term in works about politics of prewar Czechoslovakia.

It was founded as a Christian mission by Dr. Kaloost Vartan and the Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society in 1861. The hospital now houses 147 beds, employs over 500 staff, and receives over 50,000 visits annually. Background The Nazareth Hospital project was originally led by Dr. Pacradooni Kaloost Vartan with the fundraising support of William Thomson of the 39 Cowgate dispensary. Vartan, born in Constantinople to an Armenian family in 1835, he attended an American Protestant School for Armenian Boys. During the Crimean War, he served as an interpreter for British forces. There, he was moved and inspired by the poor conditions of war, and by the care provided at the hospitals run by Florence Nightingale. Vartan moved to Edinburgh, Scotland to study medicine. His studies were funded by the newly founded Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society (EMMS). Established in 1841 by a group of doctors, the EMMS aimed to provide medical services to foreign countries, to \\"circulate information on medical mission [sic], help other institutions engaged in the same work and assist as many missionary stations as their funds would permit.\\" Dr. Vartan was first funded by the Syrian Asylum Fund in 1861 to aid massacre victims in Beirut. After the Syrian Asylum Committee was dissolved, the EMMS recruited his services for a new mission in Nazareth starting in 1866. Dr. Kaloost Vartan Ottomans and health During this time, Palestine was governed by the Ottoman Empire. Lack of adequate social services and environmental factors contributed to poor public health. Citizens suffered from cholera, dysentery, malaria, and tuberculosis, and infant mortality was high. Palestine was en route for those participating in the Hajj, which made locals susceptible to a steady influx of foreign diseases. Traditional medicine included herbal treatments, cauterization, bloodletting, bonesetting, cupping, and leeching, among various tribal rituals. In 1861 the average life expectancy was 22 for males and 24 for females. Although Ottoman law required the provision of medical services, in reality, it did little more than employ a few municipal part-time workers.Ziadat, 270-271 In the 1860s, Nazareth was home to nearly 5,000 citizens, but the nearest doctor or hospital was as far away as Damascus or Beirut. Ultimately, the only care was provided by charity. History Ottoman period In 1861, Dr. Vartan arrived in Nazareth to begin work. He joined Johannes or John Zeller, a missionary of the Church Mission Society.Yaron, 129 Zeller was an Anglican priest, and helped Dr. Vartan carry out surgeries with chloroform anesthesia. Initially, Dr. Vartan was confronted with a campaign against him by local healers, who saw his plan of establishment a threat to their practices. There was also a question of funding, as the committee that sent Dr. Vartan to Nazareth disbanded in 1864. Through these tribulations, Dr. Vartan continued to practice medicine. In 1865, he treated the son of the Mayor of Nazareth, and won the title, \\"The Great Doctor.\\" Dr. Vartan first received patients in his own home. Dr. Burns Thompson, superintendent of the Coogate dispensary, supported him for two years after the original committee dissolved. In 1866, the EMMS officially adopted the Nazareth Hospital project. The society provided ¬£100 for a few beds for surgical cases, which were installed in the upper room of Dr. Vartan‚Äôs house. As the only hospital near Nazareth, these accommodations were obviously insufficient, and Dr. Vartan soon received approval from the EMMS for the purchase for two adjacent houses. One would serve as a hospital, and the other his residence and dispensary. Only a year after the expansion, 36 inpatients were admitted, and 70-100 patients were treated daily.Ziadat, 272-273 This small dispensary was located on the east side of Nazareth. A small flow of clean water was available there, but rainwater was used more frequently. The hospital staff ran a boys‚Äô Sunday school and soup kitchen,\\"Editorial Notes.\\" Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society Quarterly Paper XX (Nov. 1941): 50. Print. as well as an artists‚Äô club, in addition to normal hospital operations.\\"Editorial Notes.\\" Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society Quarterly Paper XX (Nov. 1942): 97. Print. As a Christian mission, prayers were held every morning at 7am.Hatton. \\"Impressions of a Patient in Nazareth Hospital.\\" Edinburgh Medical Missionary Society Quarterly Paper XX (Feb. 1941): 3. Print. Most nurses and staff were native to Ottoman Palestine, and had minimal English skills, which proved challenging to Dr. Vartan and his wife. Both patients and staff came from various religious denominations. Most were Christian, but Jews and Muslims worked for and were treated by the hospital, as well. An early survey of patients shows that in 1899, 5,747 Christians and 2,680 Muslims sought care in the hospital.Ziadat, 271 In 1879, a plot of land overlooking Nazareth was purchased for the establishment of a bigger hospital. Before anything could be done, Dr. Vartan was tasked with getting permission, a firman, from the Ottoman authorities to establish a dispensary. The Turkish government put a stop to his efforts to build after a misleading promise to provide a permit. No more progress was made until 1895, when the EMMS directors approved a new site west of Nazareth. Dr. Vartan died in 1908, before any construction could begin.Wilkinson, 44 Dr. Frederick John Scrimgeour succeeded Dr. Vartan as the head doctor of the mission, along with two European nurses. The new hospital was almost complete, when World War I broke out through Europe and the Middle East, and British physicians were ordered to leave Palestine.Yaron, 130 The new hospital was requisitioned by the military, stripped, and used as stables. While Dr. Scrimgeour was stuck in Egypt and unable to return; two nurses from the hospital operated in his rented residence downtown.Ziadat, 273-274Wilkinson, 46 British period The hospital was restored in 1919, and normal operations slowly resumed. In that year, the hospital was recognized by the British government‚Äôs mandate as a hospital for training nurses. In 1924, the hospital was officially inaugurated and, by 1935, it had electricity and a sanitary annex for tuberculosis patients. The mission began extending services beyond elementary care. For example, by 1924, plans were adopted for infant welfare clinics in a nearby village.Ziadat, 274-275 In 1933, an east wing was added to the hospital, which contained the \\"Abercrombie Ward\\".Wilkinson, 48-49 It soon took on the name, the \\"Hospital on the Hill\\". By this time, Dr. Scrimgeour had retired, and Dr. William D. Bathgate and Sister Mary Parkinson had taken charge of the hospital. Israeli period =20th century= In May 1948, the state of Israel was established. Dr. Runa MacKay, who joined the mission a few years later, reported that hospital operations were generally uninhibited by the political upheaval, and the majority Arab population of Nazareth remained. However, an influx of refugees created more demand on the workers. At this time, the hospital still only had 100 beds. This pressure resulted in the recruitment of more doctors. In addition to Dr. MacKay, Drs. Hester and Bernath joined the mission in May 1956. Their work inspired major changes in the hospital. Dr. Tester joined the hospital staff in 1952. Under his supervision, the hospital installed a modern laundry system, a new outpatient facility, nurses' home and chapel, and new accommodations for staff from 1957 to 1964.Wilkinson, 49 Dr. Bernath arrived at the mission in 1956, and was appointed as administrator of the hospital in 1969. He worked to continue updating the hospital, and oversaw the development of a new maternity clinic, kitchen, and most importantly, the recruitment of specialists to provide dialysis and physiotherapy. Other significant improvements include the addition of the \\"Tower Block,‚Äù an intensive care unit, in 1976. A unit for renal dialysis was opened in October 1981, and the first computer was installed the following year. This period saw another increase in hospital staff. Many of the newly hired doctors came from the Arab community, in particular, Dr. Nakhle Bishara, who became the medical director of the hospital in 1981. In that same year, Israeli healthcare reform named the Nazareth Hospital as the official district hospital for the Nazareth area. This, in addition to a strike by Israeli doctors in 1983, caused a massive influx in patients, leaving the hospital once again inadequate.Wilkinson, 51-53 In 1984, a delegation from Edinburgh was sent to review the hospital's operations and establish a plan to accommodate the renewed demand for services. Mr. Fred Aitken was appointed as head the implementation of the plan, which aimed to increase the standards of the facilities, rather than the capacity of the hospital, and had an operating budget of 3.5 million pounds. In 1988 Dr. Robert W. Martin succeeded Dr. Bernath as superintendent. In 1995, further healthcare reforms were instituted which guaranteed basic healthcare to all residents of Israel. The hospital recruited help, namely from Mr. G. Anthony Holt, who became interim general administrator, and Mr. Derek Thompson, a hospital administrator from the United Kingdom, to make further transitions to a large-scale medical facility. =21st century= In 2001, The EMMS split into two separate organizations, EMMS International and EMMS Nazareth. Thompson served as the first CEO of EMMS Nazareth, followed in 2007 Mr. Joseph Maine. In that same year, Mr. Elia Abdo became the General Director of the Nazareth Hospital. In 2010, Dr. Bishara Bisharat became the head of the hospital. In 2009, the title \\"EMMS Nazareth\\" was replaced with \\"The Nazareth Trust.\\" After almost 150 years, the Nazareth Hospital and nursing school are still operational. Today, the hospital continues to expand its practices, led by the head of the hospital, Dr. Fahid Hakeem, Dr Kemal Kem (MD MBBS DCH DRCOG DFFP MRCGP) and a faithful management team.

Locke, and then committed suicide shortly afterwards. The murder-suicide was the first incident of its type in the university's history. Shooting The murder-suicide occurred on the first day of the Fall 2000 semester shortly after noon when James Easton Kelly, 37, a recently dismissed PhD candidate in the university's Comparative Literature program entered the office of Dr. John R. Locke, 67, the director of the Comparative Literature program and Kelly's former academic advisor. After the first shot rang out, graduate student Bethany Edstrom said she heard someone say: \\"I didn't do anything.\\" At approximately 12:14 pm a 911 call was received by the Fayetteville Police Department. The caller alerted the police to an incident involving gunshots in Kimpel Hall. It was later discovered that Kelly had shot Dr. Locke three times with a .38 caliber handgun using bullets he had purchased earlier. Graduate students and faculty in adjoining offices quickly alerted campus police whose officers reached Locke's office and secured the area within a few minutes. UAPD secured the area around Room 231 Kimpel Hall and began the evacuation of the building immediately. Officers responding to at least three 911 calls found Locke's office door closed and locked. The responding officers said a man behind Locke's office door stated that he had been hurt, but that they should not enter. They conversed for a few minutes with the individual before another gunshot was heard after which no further contact was made with anyone in the office. A SWAT team was then activated and approximately an hour after the first officers arrived, police entered the office and found the bodies of Locke and Kelly with a handgun on the floor between them. Investigation Subsequent investigation of the murder-suicide determined that Kelly was disgruntled due to his recent dismissal from the PhD program in Comparative Literature for which he blamed Locke (who had actually abstained from voting for Kelly's dismissal during a graduate committee review of his progress). A satchel containing letters from the committee and his dismissal notification were found with Kelly's body. A receipt for a 50-round box of ammunition was discovered the following Wednesday in Kelly's rental car. The receipt was stamped 11:27 a.m. by a Wal-Mart 10 miles from the Fayetteville campus, roughly 40 minutes before the shooting of Locke. Moments after the initial shooting, officers heard Kelly kill himself with the final of four shots. Two bullets remained in the revolver when officers finally entered the cluttered office, university police Chief Larry Slamons said. Coroners and crime lab report The crime lab report stated that the cause of death to Dr. Locke was homicide and the cause of death to Mr. Kelly was suicide. Chief Slamons said that a shot through Locke's hand indicated he raised his arm in a futile attempt to defend himself. Slamons also said that Locke and Kelly may have struggled, with Locke perhaps landing a blow before being fatally wounded. Victim John R. Locke, son of a Danish immigrant and a New York City native, had been teaching Comparative Literature, Mythology, and Eastern philosophy at the university since 1967. In 1979, he published a translation of nine of Rainer Maria Rilke's dramas and was working on a collection of Rilke's poems and letters at the time of his death. He also circulated among friends and colleagues a private unpublished manuscript of meditation guides called The Troika Technique‚Äîbased on his readings and study of Buddhist and Taoist philosophy and Jungian psychology. He was regarded by colleagues, friends, and students as a wise and deeply spiritual man whose loss deeply impacted the campus community. Locke planned to retire at the end of the 2000‚Äì2001 academic year, which had just started on the day of his murder. Perpetrator Kelly, an African-American Arkansas native, was the son of a minister and considered a career in the ministry himself before choosing to attend Grinnell College where he earned a BA in English in 1984. He subsequently earned an MA in English from Arkansas State University in 1990. He then enrolled in the PhD program in English at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville planning to study African-American literature and the literature of the African diaspora. At first, he seemed a promising student, but eventually ran into academic difficulties and in 1996 twice failed his oral examination required for his English PhD. He subsequently accused departmental faculty of racist attitudes when they did not find his research subjects acceptable. However, Dr. Locke, despite warnings from colleagues that Kelly was aloof and unsociable, admitted him into the Comparative Literature PhD program because he thought that it might be more suitable to Kelly's academic interests. However, Kelly began enrolling in courses, but failing to attend them, and eventually Locke grew disappointed with the student's increasingly unpredictable behavior. Reaction and followup Following the tragedy, an impromptu shrine was created outside Locke's office and the university held an official memorial service on September 12, 2000. A year later, on August 27, 2001, Locke's colleagues and friends began collections to create a memorial garden outside Kimpel Hall in his honor. The memorial garden was completed and dedicated in September 2003. In 2006, Dr. Virginia Krauft, a Jungian psychologist and friend, opened the John Locke Memorial Library to house Locke's large collection of books on German, American, British, French, Russian, Irish, Italian, Asian, Japanese and Scandinavian literature and literary criticism along with studies in the sciences, visual arts and anthropology and several books on Eastern philosophy and religion.

Background  This is the third album by Thorgeir Stub√∏ released in 1984, and presents an interaction with the famous American guitarist Doug Raney, son of the legendary pioneer bopgitar, Jimmy Raney. Raney was at this time living in Denmark, and on this album Stub√∏ made Doug Raney bring along the Danish top bassist Jesper Lungaard and drummer Ole Jacob Hansen. It was an elegant and perhaps more easily swinging quartet than the previous quintet from Jazz Alive. This time the repertoire also was a bit more conservative with the older standard songs and bop tunes like \\"Everything I Love\\" (Porter), \\"Half Nelson\\" (Miles Davis), \\"Love Letters\\" (Young), \\"Get out of town\\" (Porter) Just Friends (Klenner/Lewis), \\"We'll be together again\\" (Fisher/Lane) and \\"So do it\\" (Montgomery).

This was following the demise of first Shropshire Wanderers and later indirectly after Castle Blues. The Blues were a rough team, leading to their demise after several games were marred by violence. The new team hoped to be as successful but without the notoriety. Press reports differ as to the date the new club was formed, The Eddowes Shropshire Journal of 26 May 1886 reported the birth of the club at the Lion Hotel, Wyle Cop, Shrewsbury. The Shrewsbury Chronicle reported the club's being formed at the Turf Hotel, Claremont Hill, Shrewsbury. It may be both accounts are true, with a get-together at the Lion being finalised at the Turf. After friendlies and regional cup competitions for the first few seasons, Shrewsbury were founder members of the Shropshire & District League in 1890‚Äì91, later admitted to the Birmingham & District League in 1895‚Äì96. Many of the teams Town faced in the early days have vanished, however Shrewsbury met many of today's Football League and Conference teams, including Crewe Alexandra, Coventry City, Stoke City, Kidderminster Harriers and Stafford Rangers. In 1910, Shrewsbury looked to move to a new ground, having spent early years at locations across the town, notably at Copthorne Barracks west of the town. The club moved to Gay Meadow on the edge of the town centre, within sight of Shrewsbury Abbey, and stayed 97 years. Shrewsbury's Birmingham League days were mostly mid-table, with a few seasons challenging near the top, the club being league champions in 1922‚Äì23. A move to the Midland Champions League in 1937‚Äì38 saw the club enjoy one of its most successful seasons, winning a league and cup treble. Shrewsbury were league champions, scoring 111 goals . In addition, the Welsh Cup was won following a replay, the team enjoyed a run in the FA Cup, and won the Shropshire Senior Cup. After a run of good seasons in post-war years, Shrewsbury were admitted to the old Division 3 (North) of the Football League in 1950, after being Midland League champions in 1949‚Äì50. Football League history Chart of yearly table positions of The Shrews in the Football League.Shrewsbury Town were elected to the Football League Division 3 North for 1950‚Äì51 following the decision to expand from 88 to 92 clubs. Shrewsbury were then promoted to the Third Division in 1958‚Äì59. They remained in the third tier 15 years, slipping back to Division Four at the end of 1973‚Äì74. 1960‚Äì61 season saw Shrewsbury Town reach the Semi Final of the League Cup. After beating Everton (then the biggest club in the country) in the Quarter Final they narrowly lost 4‚Äì3 on aggregate to Rotherham United. This era was also remembered for Arthur Rowley. He arrived from Leicester City in 1958, the club's first player/manager. During his playing and managerial career, he broke Dixie Dean's goal-scoring record, scoring his 380th league goal against Bradford City at Valley Parade on 29 April 1961. Retiring from playing in 1965 he remained manager until July 1968. Shrewsbury were promoted to the Third Division in 1974‚Äì75 as runners-up, before another successful season in 1978‚Äì79, when they were league champions under Ritchie Barker and later Graham Turner. Over 14,000 fans packed Gay Meadow on 17 May 1979 to see Shrewsbury seal promotion with a 4‚Äì1 win over Exeter City. In addition, the club had their best ever FA Cup run. The most successful manager is Graham Turner, who won the Third Division Championship in 1978‚Äì79 ‚Äì his first season in charge and took the club into the Second Division for the first time. They remained for ten years, although Turner departed for Aston Villa in 1984. 1980s & 1990s The club enjoyed some great times in the FA Cup in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Shrewsbury repeated their 1979 feat of reaching the quarter-final in 1981‚Äì82. The fifth- round game was particularly memorable, as Shrewsbury were drawn to face UEFA Cup holders Ipswich Town for the second year (Ipswich previously winning 3‚Äì0 in a fifth round replay). Ipswich were one of Europe's top teams. Shrewsbury won 2‚Äì1 with goals from Steve Cross and Jake King, Mich D'Avray scoring for the visitors. Following this win, Shrewsbury faced Leicester City at Filbert Street in the quarter final. With the game 2‚Äì2 at half time, Shrewsbury were 45 minutes from a semi-final appearance, but Leicester, having used three goalkeepers and including a young Gary Lineker in their line up, eventually ran out 5‚Äì2 winners. The 1980s saw many big teams defeated by Shrewsbury, whose period in the old Second Division coincided with some of the current Premier League clubs. During the 1980s, Fulham, Newcastle United, Blackburn Rovers, West Ham United and Chelsea lost to Shrewsbury Town. Middlesbrough were defeated at Gay Meadow at the end of 1985‚Äì86, Shrewsbury winning 2‚Äì1, relegating Middlesbrough, who went out of business and almost out of existence. The match was marred by violence from Middlesbrough fans, with many of them later having to return to Shrewsbury for court appearances. In the early to mid-1980s the club enjoyed its most successful Football League run. Shrewsbury survived through the sale of players, with some to have played for Shrewsbury including Steve Ogrizovic, David Moyes, John McGinlay and Bernard McNally. After a couple of relegation scares, Shrewsbury's Second Division life ended at the end of 1988‚Äì89 after ten years. As the 1990s dawned, the club were unable to make a quick return to the Second Division, spending the early 1990s mid-table. In the Third Division, on 22 December 1990, Gary Shaw scored the quickest Town hat trick ‚Äì 4 minutes and 32 seconds ‚Äì against Bradford City at Valley Parade. At the end of 1991‚Äì92, three years after relegation to the Third Division, the club was relegated to the Fourth ‚Äì the first time since 1975. However, two seasons later Shrewsbury won the new (fourth tier) Division Three championship under Fred Davies in 1993‚Äì94, and remained in Division Two (third tier) three seasons. Shrewsbury were not to rise any further, remaining mid-table before slipping down again at the end of 1996‚Äì97. The 1990s saw Shrewsbury make their first appearance at Wembley as finalists in the 1996 Football League Trophy final. Shrewsbury lost 2‚Äì1 to Rotherham United; future Shrewsbury striker Nigel Jemson scoring both Rotherham goals. The Wembley final was the beginning of the end for Fred Davies, sacked at the end of the 1996‚Äì97 relegation season. By this time, Shrewsbury were less of a force, heading to a stale period. Dwindling crowds meant Shrewsbury didn't have the finances to compete and it was in this backdrop that Jake King arrived, following a successful reign at local rivals Telford United. A successful Shrewsbury player during the 1980s, King was well regarded by fans and the chairman, businessman Roland Wycherley. For Wycherley, the priority was to assure Shrewsbury's financial future, before increasing the club's profile and finally to ensure the club's move to a new ground. King was forced to work on one of the smallest playing budgets in the league. He worked with the club's youth set-up, bringing in promising non- league players. However, with the pick of the transfer market finding better offers elsewhere, Shrewsbury were to see out the 1990s in mediocre fashion. Kevin Ratcliffe era Loggerheads emblem used by the club between 1993 and 2007 In the 1999‚Äì2000, Shrewsbury endured a poor season, with King being sacked in November as the club flirted with relegation. Former Everton captain and Welsh international Kevin Ratcliffe was appointed manager steered the club from relegation on the final day of 1999‚Äì2000. With the club facing relegation to the Conference, a 2‚Äì1 victory away to Exeter City kept the club in the league, after Carlisle United and Chester City both lost, Chester being relegated. Ratcliffe worked on improving the side. Former youth team and reserve player Luke Rodgers emerged as a regular goal-scorer, and with big names arriving at Shrewsbury, the team looked on the up, narrowly missing the 2001‚Äì02 league playoffs despite 70 points. At the start of 2002‚Äì03, Shrewsbury were on the up, with a youthful team strengthened by Ian Woan, Nigel Jemson and Mark Atkins. However, despite an encouraging start, league form suffered, including away defeats to Boston United, Rushden & Diamonds and Cambridge United, Town conceding 16 goals across the three matches as they remained in the bottom half of the table. A sideshow was an FA Cup run. After dispatching non-league sides Stafford Rangers and Barrow A.F.C., Shrewsbury were at home to Everton in the third round. Town won in front of 7,800. A first-half free kick from Nigel Jemson gave Town the lead at the interval, however an equaliser from Niclas Alexandersson appeared to send the tie to a replay at Goodison Park. However, with minutes left, from a free kick by Ian Woan, Jemson heading in the cross to give Town 2‚Äì1 victory. For Shrewsbury fans, a notable point was the performance of Shrewsbury's Peter Wilding. A former Sunday League defender from local leagues, Wilding kept Wayne Rooney marked. Wilding was also one to escape criticism later. Chelsea were the fourth round visitors, in a televised match on BBC's Match of the Day. Town lost 4‚Äì0, with Gianfranco Zola the man of the match. A near capacity crowd of 7,950 turned up for Chelsea, but from then form disappeared. The team won just twice in the league thereafter. Jemson, who split opinions; was a scapegoat, (Jemson was once in an argument mid-match with a Shrewsbury fan), with Ian Woan another singled out, being booed off after being substituted in his final Shrewsbury appearance. That was against Carlisle United, a 3‚Äì2 defeat relegating Shrewsbury. Seven points adrift at the bottom and having conceded 92 goals, the club contemplated the end of their 53 years in the league. Following angry demonstrations from fans, Ratcliffe resigned, and Mark Atkins took temporary charge for the club final League game, a 2‚Äì1 defeat to Scunthorpe United, who were coincidentally the first League opponents for Shrewsbury Town back in 1950. Conference days After some speculation, Northwich Victoria manager Jimmy Quinn was appointed Shrewsbury manager in May 2003, with the aim of getting Shrewsbury promoted back to the Football League at the first attempt. For the first time in many years, Shrewsbury were seen as the 'big fish' in the league, with many experts predicting a league victory. With most of the previous year's players released, Quinn assembled a whole new squad, with experienced non-league players such as Darren Tinson and Jake Sedgemore being joined by Colin Cramb, Scott Howie and former League Cup finalist Martin O'Connor. On the field, a new-look Shrewsbury side seemed to have the desire that the previous side lacked, but at times lacked consistency. Thrilling matches, such as a 4‚Äì1 home victory over Hereford United, were tempered by some embarrassing results, including a 5‚Äì0 away defeat to Dagenham & Redbridge and two away defeats to local rivals Telford United, both in the league and the FA Trophy. However, as the season went on, the side were able to grind out some decent results. The league title went to Chester City, but with 74 points, Shrewsbury finished third in the league, comfortably qualifying for the league playoffs, the first time the club had ever qualified for a playoff competition. In the semi-finals, Shrewsbury faced Barnet over two legs. The opening leg at Underhill saw Shrewsbury lose 2‚Äì1, with Barnet scoring an injury time winner. Over 7,000 saw the return match at Gay Meadow, a match that was televised live on Sky Sports. Shrewsbury drew level on aggregate following a Luke Rodgers penalty. With the teams level after extra-time, Scott Howie saved a penalty from Barnet's Simon Clist, and Darren Moss scored the winning penalty, setting Shrewsbury for the Conference playoff final against Aldershot Town, at the neutral venue of the Britannia Stadium, home of Stoke City. The final against Aldershot, on Sunday 16 May 2004 saw 19,216 fans visit the Britannia Stadium, two-thirds of those being Shrewsbury fans making the short journey up the A53. In glorious sunny weather, the two teams played out a 1‚Äì1 draw, and after both teams blew their chance to win the match in injury time, the game went to penalties. Striker Luke Rodgers, seemingly a banker to score a penalty stepped up, but inexplicably blasted his shot high over the bar. With Shrewsbury fans anxiously looking on, Shrewsbury goalkeeper Scott Howie earned himself a place in Shrewsbury folklore as he saved three consecutive Aldershot penalties. Shrewsbury converted their remaining penalties, defender Trevor Challis scored the winning penalty and began the celebrations, which began at Stoke, and continued in Shrewsbury for weeks. It may not have been glorious, but by sheer hard work, Shrewsbury were back in the Football League. Return to Football League Unfortunately for Shrewsbury, the optimism from the play-off final victory soon evaporated. An opening day 1‚Äì0 defeat to Lincoln City was an indicator of what was to come, as Shrewsbury were to flirt with the relegation places and were defeated in the FA Cup first round by Histon. In the eyes of most fans, Jimmy Quinn was not up to the job, and departed after just 14 league games, being replaced by former Preston manager Gary Peters. Peters came to Gay Meadow with a modest but at the same time impressive track record, including a spell as Preston manager during the mid-1990s, during which he signed David Beckham as a loan player. After nearly saving Exeter City from relegation in 2002‚Äì03, he resigned and was working as a scout for Everton before taking up the Shrewsbury job. With the club seemingly on a downward spiral back to the Conference, Peters was able to stem the slide, and preserved Shrewsbury's Football League status in the 2004‚Äì05 League Two campaign. Since, Peters looked to strengthen the side, transforming the side from one that was favourites for relegation in 2004‚Äì05, to one that were seen as realistic promotion candidates. Many pundits saw Shrewsbury as relegation favourites in the 2005‚Äì06 season, but despite a poor start, Peters was able to guide the team to a tenth-place finish, narrowly missing the play-offs. Off the field, Shrewsbury, for so long one of the smallest and least-funded teams in the league, had cause to look to the future with optimism. The Shrewsbury Town board, headed by Roland Wycherley, was starting to see their policy of sound financial management pay off, with the club more solvent than many of its rivals. The recent FA cup run, subsequent fall-out from the Ratcliffe era and the solitary season in the Conference had galvanised local support, and attendances were on the increase. And finally, after a drawn-out, and sometimes bitter planning process stretching as far back as 1999, Shrewsbury's plans to move ground came to fruition, as Wycherly ceremoniously cut the first sod of soil at the New Meadow in the summer of 2006. Despite the departure of talented young goalkeeper Joe Hart to Manchester City, Shrewsbury entered the 2006‚Äì07 season as promotion hopefuls in their final year at Gay Meadow. However the home ground was to wreak havoc with the opening part of Shrewsbury's season, poor weather leading to the ground being flooded and several matches being called off. With several matches in hand due to the cancellations, the club were as low as 16th in the table by February 2007, but with the team going on an impressive 14 match unbeaten run, they were in play- off contention by the end of the season. Following a 2‚Äì2 draw against Grimsby Town in the final League match to be held at Gay Meadow, Shrewsbury finished in seventh place and thus qualified for the play-offs. Shrewsbury faced Milton Keynes Dons over two legs, following a goalless draw at the Gay Meadow, they beat MK Dons 2‚Äì1 on their return fixture at the National Hockey Stadium, thus winning 2‚Äì1 on aggregate. With Andy Cooke scoring both goals. The team faced Bristol Rovers in the League Two play-off final on 26 May 2007 at the new Wembley Stadium in front of a League 2(4th tier) play-off final record crowd of 61,589. However, despite an early goal from Stewart Drummond, Bristol Rovers were strong opponents and hit back with two first half goals through Richard Walker. A late Sammy Igoe goal made it 3‚Äì1 to Bristol Rovers, sealing their victory. New stadium Greenhous Meadow, Shrewsbury. The club moved to the New Meadow stadium for the 2007‚Äì08 season. After an encouraging early start which began with a 4‚Äì0 win away to Lincoln City, Shrewsbury were amongst the league leaders, however a 4‚Äì3 home defeat to Rochdale started an alarming nosedive in form from which the side never recovered. Following pressure from supporters, manager Gary Peters left the club on 3 March 2008 by mutual consent. Paul Simpson was appointed as the new manager on a 3-year contract on 12 March, and was able to guide the club to an eventual 18th-place finish in the league. On 21 July the club announced that it had secured a deal with kit manufacturer Prostar for the naming rights of the stadium, which saw the club's Oteley Road stadium officially renamed as 'The Prostar Stadium'. The 2008/9 season saw Shrewsbury make a successful start, with the club running amongst the leading clubs in League Two. Home form was amongst the strongest in the Football League, with the team winning an unprecedented number of games with a high goal margin, including a 4‚Äì0 win over Macclesfield Town on the opening day of the season, and a record-equalling 7‚Äì0 league win over Gillingham, the team who would eventually beat them in the playoff final. Shrewsbury progressed to the latter stages of the Football League Trophy, following a 7‚Äì0 away win at Wycombe Wanderers, and 5‚Äì0 home win against Dagenham and Redbridge until going out in a penalty shoot out against league one's Brighton and Hove Albion. However the club's indifferent FA Cup form of recent years did not improve as they lost away to a non-league side for the second time in five years, being beaten 3‚Äì1 by Blyth Spartans in the first round. Shrewsbury's league campaign during 2008/09 was hampered by a lack of wins away from home. Despite several encouraging performances, Shrewsbury's win at their opening away match, versus Exeter City was to be their only league victory away from home for eight months, until beating Rotherham United 2‚Äì1 at the Don Valley Stadium in April. The final day of the season saw Shrewsbury lying just outside the play-off places in eighth place, behind seventh place Dagenham and Redbridge, whom the club travelled to for their final league game of the season. A dramatic 2‚Äì1 victory saw Shrewsbury snatch the final play-off place at the expense of the plucky Daggers, in only their second season of league football. Shrewsbury faced Bury in the play off semi finals, with a then record crowd of 8,429 turning up for the opening home game, which saw Bury take a narrow 1‚Äì0 win thanks to a late own goal from ex- Shrewsbury defender Neil Ashton, who chipped the ball over goalkeeper Luke Daniels in a defensive-mix up. Whilst Daniels was seen by some as the villain after the home leg, three days later he produced a man of the match performance as Shrewsbury progressed to their second play-off final in three years. Daniels saved a first-half penalty from Phil Jevons, however with time running out Kevin McIntyre scored a spectacular 88th minute volley to take the tie into extra time. Daniels was to keep Shrewsbury in the tie during extra- time as Bury tried to finish the game, with Shrewsbury's plight being made tougher after midfielder Steve Leslie was controversially sent off just seconds into extra time. However, with the scores 1‚Äì1 on aggregate, Shrewsbury were to convert all four of their spot-kicks in the penalty shootout, with Daniels making two saves to send Shrewsbury through 4‚Äì3 on aggregate. Shrewsbury lost 0‚Äì1 to Gillingham in the play-off final at Wembley Stadium on 23 May in front of 53,706, with a goal in the 90th minute by Gillingham's Simeon Jackson which was seen as controversial because referee Clive Oliver gave a corner when video evidence showed it clearly wasn't. On 30 April 2010, after a disappointing 2009‚Äì10 season, Paul Simpson was dismissed as manager of Shrewsbury Town with two games remaining. Three Caretaker managers were installed for the remaining two games, reserve team manager Stuart Delaney, youth team coach David Hughes and former club captain Mike Jackson. Shrewsbury finished a measurable 12th after showing signs throughout the campaign of at least finishing in a play off spot, even briefly challenging for the automatic spots around the New Year period. Coincidentally, performances in their last two games noticeably improved after Simpson's dismissal. Even with the absence of top-scorer Dave Hibbert during the games, the Town showed positive attacking football. A draw against Morecambe on 1 May would've even made the playoffs still mathematically possible, although taking into account other team results. The game ended in a 3‚Äì2 defeat after Kevin McIntyre's failed attempt to level it 3‚Äì3 in added time from the penalty spot. They went to local rivals Port Vale on the final day of the season and despite the circumstances, finished the season with relatively strong form. They managed a draw with Vale, the home side only managing to equalise from the penalty spot. The Return of Graham Turner With such previous success as player and manager of Shrewsbury Town during their heyday of the late 1970s through to 1984, at Wolverhampton Wanderers, and then at cash-strapped Hereford United as chairman and manager combined, Graham Turner returned to Shrewsbury Town, being installed as manager on 11 June 2010. He couldn't achieve automatic promotion though, and the club finished fourth at the end of the 2010‚Äì11 season. During the 2011‚Äì12 season Shrewsbury had two mini cup runs in both the League Cup and FA Cup. Their League Cup run saw them defeat Championship side Derby County 3‚Äì2 at Pride Park, and Premier League Swansea City 3‚Äì1 at Greenhous Meadow before being narrowly beaten 3‚Äì1 by the Premiership's Arsenal at The Emirates Stadium. The FA Cup run saw them dispatch Conference club Newport County and League 2 Rotherham United before being very narrowly beaten by 1‚Äì0 by the Championship's Middlesbrough at The Riverside Stadium. Furthermore, the club also went a year unbeaten at home finishing the 2011/12 season winning 1‚Äì0 over Dagenham and Redbridge from a James Collins header to achieve promotion to League One after 15 years in League Two, excluding spending the 2003‚Äì04 season in the Conference. Return to the 3rd Tier After a 15-year absence, Salop were promoted to League One with a game to spare, finishing in 2nd place after a home win against Dagenham and Redbridge. Despite the success, preparation for the new campaign started with concern, as five of Shrewsbury's players, all of whom were vital in Salop's promotion success and all also out of contract, were to leave in less than 2 months after sealing promotion, most only being offered 1 year contracts, which surprised many fans. This included keeper Chris Neal, centre back duo Shane Cansdall-Sheriff and (captain) Ian Sharps, central midfielder Nicky Wroe and 2011-12's 16-goal top goalscorer James Collins. However, Graham Turner was able to replace the departed players before pre season with some promising signings. This included experienced keepers Chris Weale from Leicester City and youngster Joe Anyon from Lincoln City, centre back Darren Jones from Aldershot, central midfielders Luke Summerfield (Cheltenham Town) and Asa Hall (Oxford United), utility and former Hereford duo Rob Purdie (Hereford Utd) and Paul Parry (Preston North End), Southampton youngster Ryan Doble (striker) and centre back Michael Hector on-loan from Reading. Pre season, although naturally lacking the competition of league football, showed real promise for the new League 1 side. Shrewsbury showed great passing, movement on and off the ball and a solid defence, with stand out performances coming from the likes of Hector, Purdie (playing at left back), Summerfield and Parry (playing on the left wing). The season itself wasn't to run quite as smoothly, and after a 4‚Äì0 hammering at Leeds United in the League Cup, Shrewsbury's first game back in the 3rd Tier was to also end in a narrow 1‚Äì0 away defeat to predicted promotion hopefuls Sheffield United, despite playing a very good game. Shrewsbury's first few months in League 1 were to be full of promising performances matched with inconsistent results. Beating Preston North End 1‚Äì0 at home matched their performances, whilst losing 3‚Äì2 to then top of the table Notts County away didn't. It soon became clear that after all the creative football, striker duo Marvin Morgan and Terry Gornell were not producing the goals needed at this higher level of football. As a result, Shrewsbury's form and passing game started to slip from the lack of points and wins, and Graham Turner's side also started to go through many changes game after game, most likely in the hopes of finding the right formula. Shrewsbury's defence were the next to suffer in form, which began leaking many goals. After the dropping, and eventual departure, of promising on-loan centre back Michael Hector, Darren Jones was to suffer greatly in form. Jones was to be paired with a number of different centre backs, this included Shrewsbury players Reuben Hazell and Jermaine Grandison, as well as loan signings Lee Collins (Barnsley) and Julian Bennett (Sheffield Wednesday), the former making many mistakes much like his partner Jones, the latter showing some more promising performances before returning to Wednesday due to injury. Shrewsbury's passing game also started to let them down, with the midfield finding it hard to link up with the strikers, most notably captain Matt Richards who had personally failed to match the form he showed in the season prior. As a result, by the turn of the year Shrewsbury found themselves hovering around the relegation places and still yet to clock up a single away win. Shrewsbury's form was to change considerably after knocking up their first away win on New Years Day against Coventry. This coincided with a noticeable improvement in defence, with youngster Connor Goldson finding form, promising performances from centre back loan signings Rob Edwards (Sheffield United) and youngster Yado Mambo (Charlton Athletic), and a greater attacking threat with the signing and return of Shrewsbury legend Luke Rodgers and the rise in form of goalscoring winger Jon Taylor. The rest of Salop's League One campaign was to be blighted with inconsistency, in performances, tactics and results. Highlights included the introduction of Bolton loanee Tom Eaves. The 6'5 striker managed 6 goals in 10 games, which included an impressive hat trick at home to Crawley Town before being recalled by his parent club, most likely due to his performances. Shrewsbury ultimately managed to seal League One safety with two games to spare after a 1‚Äì0 win at home to Oldham Athletic. Relegation back to level four, Graham Turner's reign ends During the summer months after eventually staying up with two games to spare, it was a chance to push on and become a major force in League One. However the failure of recruiting the right calibre of player for this level led to as disappointing season. Graham Turner resigned in February after a string of 6 successive defeats and Mike Jackson took over as caretaker boss. Some highlights of the season were the two local derbies against Wolverhampton Wanderers where a new record attendance at Greenhous Meadow was set on 21 September 2013. A crowd of 9,510 saw Town lose 1‚Äì0 with a late penalty scored by Bakary Sako the difference between the teams. The return fixture in March saw Town gain a much needed point holding on for a 0‚Äì0 draw. Relegation was finally confirmed after a 4‚Äì2 home defeat against Peterborough United. Micky Mellon era In May 2014 ex-Fleetwood Town boss Micky Mellon was appointed first team manager. His first signings included Ashley Vincent, Nathaniel Knight-Percival and luring former forward James Collins back to the club. References Category:Shrewsbury Town F.C.

The pond is home to many Canada geese, ducks, fish, and plants. The park is owned and operated by the Corporation of the City of Markham, and is maintained by the city's Parks Department.  History  At the intersection of Carlton Rd and Main St Unionville, a flour mill, the Union Grist Mill, was built at around 1840. Toogood Pond, earlier named Willow Lake and often referred to only as \\"the pond\\", was formed when a dam was placed across Bruce Creek, a tributary of the Rouge River, to make a mill race to provide water to power a flat mill wheel for the grist mill. In the 1930s, during a flash flood, the mill race was washed away, and the mill was destroyed by fire four years later in 1934 and never rebuilt.unionvilleinfo.com. (n.d.)

His maternal grandfather, J√°nos P√°rk√°nyn√°nay Csereszny√©s, was also a high-ranked military officer (‚úü1941). His paternal grandmother Franciska Vil√°gi √Åll√≥ was born in Nadasd, in the Csall√≥k√∂z region (‚úü1943). His grandparents on both sides were buried at the Andr√°s cemetery, Bratislava but their tombs were dismantled together with many Hungarian and German tombs in the 1980s. His father, S√°ndor Quittner, according to the family tradition, was designated to have a military career. So it happened that he, as a cadet at the age of 16 in World War I fell into the power of the Russians, and as a consequence of the Trianon Treaty could return to Pozsony only ten years later (‚úü1962). His mother, Ir√©n P√°rk√°nyn√°nay Csereszny√©s died in 1978. Both rest in the M√°rton cemetery, Pozsony. In 1961, at the age of 20, he married Roz√°lia Tekauer, whom he met in the above-mentioned Csall√≥k√∂zi Folk Song and Dance Ensemble.

It was his father who sent him to a school with Slovak as the language of instruction, with the intention to minimize the potential for possible conflicts with the state. This art school made him love everything associated with scenic arts and dance. As a secondary school student, he often attended folk dance rehearsals of the Fels≈ë-Csall√≥k√∂zi Folk Ensemble operating in Pozsonyp√ºsp√∂ki, and later to the Csall√≥k√∂zi Folk Song and Dance Ensemble to Somorja. In 1967 he graduated from the four-year correspondence course of amateur choreography and leadership of ensembles. This was acknowledged as a master course by the state cultural and educational institutions. Between 1964‚Äì1973 he was a dancer and choreographer fellow at the Hungarian State Folk Ensemble.

Malthause theatre. At the end of 1996, he returned to Europe, where he directed in Germany (\\"Sleeping Knights\\", Alv√≥ lovagok), works on a script and directs the Legend and Message (Rege √©s √ºzenet) programme for the Gombasz√∂g Cultural Days, as well as the ‚ÄûWe Light a Fire, We Spread Love\\" (T√ºzet gy√∫jtunk, szeretetet osztunk) dance theatre production for the ‚ÄûT√ºnd√©rr√≥zsa\\" Heritage Preservation Association in Dunasziget.

Critical reception  This live album recorded in Troms√∏, is perhaps the strongest and most consistent of all of Thorgeir Stub√∏ releases. The band works well together, and exercises uncompromising and very hard-swinging bop of high international standing. Saxophonist Krister Andersson stands well in this repertoire, with his harsh tone and highly Coltraneinspirerte performance on this release definitely keep very high international standard. Pianist Lars Sj√∂sten have some minimalist style, where the most improvisations largely based on the design development and this is a nice contrast to Stub√∏'s and Andersson's more hectic play.

With the aid of the BORS, marksmen can rapidly account for temperature, barometric pressure and aiming at an upward or downward angle. Design and features The BORS mounted atop a Leupold Mark 4 M1. The computer built into the BORS, constantly updates to account for changing factors. Barrett states that the BORS \\"instantly takes care of the data work so the shooter can focus on the task of putting lead on target.\\" It takes data from thousands of tables and accounts for a number of real-time external factors automatically giving the shooter the exact yardage at which a bullet will hit its target. Since the BORS is mounted directly to the scope and coupled with the elevation knobs, the computer can interact with the scope by simply turning the elevation knob until the LCD displays the target‚Äôs range. The kit includes the proprietary Barrett Ballistic Software that is pre-programmed with a library selected by Barrett. It also includes a cable that allows users to program custom loads on their computer and transfer them directly to the BORS. Use While designed to withstand military operations, the BORS is also available for civilian sale and can be used by long-range marksmen including target shooters and hunters.
