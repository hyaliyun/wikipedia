It is more commonly known as Fc-gamma receptor 1 (FcŒ≥RI). After binding IgG, CD64 interacts with an accessory chain known as the common Œ≥ chain (Œ≥ chain), which possesses an ITAM motif that is necessary for triggering cellular activation. Structurally CD64 is composed of a signal peptide that allows its transport to the surface of a cell, three extracellular immunoglobulin domains of the C2-type that it uses to bind antibody, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a short cytoplasmic tail. CD64 is constitutively found on only macrophages and monocytes, but treatment of polymorphonuclear leukocytes with cytokines like IFNŒ≥ and G-CSF can induce CD64 expression on these cells. There are three distinct (but highly similar) genes in humans for CD64 called FcŒ≥RIA (CD64A), FcŒ≥RIB (CD64B), and FcŒ≥RIC (CD64C) that are located on chromosome 1. These three genes produce six different mRNA transcripts; two from CD64A, three from CD64B, and one from CD64C; by alternate splicing of the genes.

It was also the site of the 1545 Battle of Bonchurch being one of the three locations where 2000 French troops landed on the Isle of Wight coast.

Family background Born into a wealthy family, Kwan was raised in Canada. His father is Hong Kong record producer William Kwan, an executive for the Hong Kong division of PolyGram, who played in the band Teddy Robin and the Playboys with his brother Teddy Robin in his youth. Due to the elder Kwan's close relationship with Hong Kong singer Alan Tam, Tam became Kelvin Kwan's godfather. Kwan and Jill Vidal shot to stardom by filming anti-drug commercials in Hong Kong. Career =Music= In 2004, during the summer vacation after his first year of university in Toronto, Kwan went on a trip to Taiwan; after a night of karaoke with his father's ex- coworkers, Kwan was offered an audition, and was signed to Universal Music's Taiwan division. A year later, he moved to Hong Kong. Tam immediately took Kwan under his wing, teaching him how to face the media and deal with their queries about his personal life, which began to arise in July 2006 after he was seen attending a concert with fellow Universal Music singer Gia Lin. Tam's relationship with Kwan continued to be a boost to Kwan's career; in August 2006, the pair recorded a music video of the duet \\"Big Cry Baby (Â§ßÂñäÂåÖ)\\", which secured Kwan's popularity in the Hong Kong music industry. However, Tam has not been reticent in pointing out Kwan's flaws and errors publicly; in a September 2006 interview with the Sing Tao Daily, he criticised Kwan's public speaking abilities and suggested he concentrate harder on singing during performances; Kwan reportedly felt awkward and hurt by Tam's words. Regardless, Kwan still credits a great deal of his success to Tam claiming that he would not be where he is today without his help and guidance. Kwan's self-titled debut album was released on 11 October 2006. Among the songs on the album was Big Cry Baby, which only 5 days after the album's release was ranked as China's 4th most popular duet by China Central Television. =Community service= Kwan and Jill Vidal participated in a number of community service activities aimed at preventing drug use and shoplifting.

It replaced the M-League as the top-most tier for professional Malaysian football clubs. The season kicked off on February 14, 2004. Pahang FA dominated the season and ended up winning the title by a wide margin and this was down to their efforts in securing the services of the nation's top players prior to the start of the new season. Pahang FA's Indra Putra Mahayuddin was the season's top goalscorer with 15 goals. He remains, until this day, the last Malaysian to win that accolade. The highest scoring match of the season was Perlis FA 6-2 defeat of Kedah FA on July 31, 2004. A plus point was the surprisingly strong finish of club side Public Bank FC. At this time, the Football Association of Malaysia were trying to promote clubs as the future of Malaysian football. =League table= =Top scorers= 2005 The 2005 season of the Malaysia Super League was the second since its inception in 2004.

The highest number of goals featured in a match throughout the season was six. Four matches ended with six goals.

With this title, they finally erased the painful memory of losing the 1996 M-League crown having topped the table for most of that season. Their nearest rivals were Melaka TMFC with 33 points. Having been in the title contention for most parts of the season, they were the best positioned club side in MSL history after Public Bank FC in 2004.

Reception AllMusic, not realizing that the album's nine studio tracks were all recorded nine years or more before its release, commented that \\"Essentially, this is a Toto reunion album, featuring nine new studio cuts and four live tracks[...]\\" and said that the material was more similar to that on Tambu than the band's most recent studio album. They praised the performances but concluded the release to be \\"not particularly interesting to anyone except hardcore fans\\". Vocalist Fergie Frederiksen is the only former member of the band that doesn't appear on the booklet photo sleeve. He is not featured on any song either.

CD16 has been identified as Fc receptors FcŒ≥RIIIa (CD16a) and FcŒ≥RIIIb (CD16b), which participate in signal transduction. The most well-researched membrane receptor implicated in triggering lysis by NK cells, CD16 is a molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF) involved in antibody- dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). It can be used to isolate populations of specific immune cells through fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) or magnetic-activated cell sorting, using antibodies directed towards CD16.  Function  CD16 is the type III FcŒ≥ receptor. In humans, it exists in two different forms: FcŒ≥RIIIa (CD16a) and FcŒ≥RIIIb (CD16b), which have 96% sequence similarity in the extracellular immunoglobulin binding regions. While FcŒ≥RIIIa is expressed on mast cells, macrophages, and natural killer cells as a transmembrane receptor, FcŒ≥RIIIb is only expressed on neutrophils. In addition, FcŒ≥RIIIb is the only Fc receptor anchored to the cell membrane by a glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) linker, and also plays a significant role in triggering calcium mobilization and neutrophil degranulation. FcŒ≥RIIIa and FcŒ≥RIIIb together are able to activate degranulation, phagocytosis, and oxidative burst, which allows neutrophils to clear opsonized pathogens.  Mechanism and regulation  These receptors bind to the Fc portion of IgG antibodies, which then activates antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) in human NK cells. CD16 is required for ADCC processes carried out by human monocytes. In humans, monocytes expressing CD16 have a variety of ADCC capabilities in the presence of specific antibodies, and can kill primary leukemic cells, cancer cell lines, and cells infected with hepatitis B virus. In addition, CD16 is able to mediate the direct killing of some virally infected and cancer cells without antibodies. After binding to ligands such as the conserved section of IgG antibodies, CD16 on human NK cells induce gene transcription of surface activation molecules such as IL-2-R (CD25) and inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-gamma and TNF. This CD16-induced expression of cytokine mRNA in NK cells is mediated by the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFATp), a cyclosporin A (CsA)-sensitive factor that regulates the transcription of various cytokines. The upregulated expression of specific cytokine genes occurs via a CsA-sensitive and calcium-dependent mechanism.  Structure  The crystal structures of FcŒµRIŒ±, FcŒ≥RIIa, FcŒ≥RIIb and FcŒ≥RIII have been experimentally determined. These structures revealed a conserved immunoglobulin-like (Ig-like) structure. In addition, the structures demonstrated a common feature in all known Ig superfamily Fc receptors: the acute hinge angle between the N- and C-terminal Ig domains. Specifically, the structure of CD16 (FcŒ≥RIIIb) consists of two immunoglobulin-like domains, with an interdomain hinge angle of around 50¬∞. The receptor's Fc binding region also carries a net positive charge, which complements the negatively-charged receptor binding regions on Fc.  Clinical significance  CD16 plays a significant role in early activation of natural killer (NK) cells following vaccination. In addition, CD16 downregulation represents a possible way to moderate NK cell responses and maintain immune homeostasis in both T cell and antibody-dependent signaling pathways. In a normal, healthy individual, cross- linking of CD16 (FcŒ≥RIII) by immune complexes induces antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) in NK cells. However, this pathway can also be targeted in cancerous or diseased cells by immunotherapy. After influenza vaccination, CD16 downregulation was associated with significant upregulation of influenza-specific plasma antibodies, and positively correlated with degranulation of NK cells. CD38 on leukocytes attaching to CD16 on endothelial cells allows for leukocyte binding to blood vessel walls, and the passage of leukocytes through blood vessel walls. CD16 is often used as an additional marker to reliably identify different subsets of human immune cells. Several other CD molecules, such as CD11b and CD33, are traditionally used as markers for human myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). However, since these markers are also expressed on NK cells and all other cells derived from myelocytes, other markers are required, such as CD14 and CD15. Neutrophils are found to be CD14low and CD15high, whereas monocytes are CD14high and CD15low. While these two markers are sufficient to differentiate between neutrophils and monocytes, eosinophils have a similar CD15 expression to neutrophils. Therefore, CD16 is used as a further marker to identify neutrophils: mature neutrophils are CD16high, while eosinophils and monocytes are both CD16low. CD16 allows for distinction between these two types of granulocytes. Additionally, CD16 expression varies between the different stages of neutrophil development: neutrophil progenitors that have differentiation capacity are CD16low, with increasing expression of CD16 in metamyelocytes, banded, and mature neutrophils, respectively. As a drug target With its expression on neutrophils, CD16 represents a possible target in cancer immunotherapy. Margetuximab, an Fc-optimized monoclonal antibody that recognizes the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expressed on tumor cells in breast, bladder, and other solid tumor cancers, targets CD16A in preference to CD16B. In addition, CD16 could play a role in antibody- targeting cancer therapies. FcŒ≥RIV, a murine homologue of CD16A has been shown to be involved in antibody-mediated depletion of tumor-infiltrating regulatory T cells in monoclonal antibody mediated immunotherapy. Bispecific antibody fragments, such as anti-CD19/CD16, allow the targeting of immunotherapeutic drugs to the cancer cell. Anti-CD19/CD16 diabodies have been shown to enhance the natural killer cell response to B-cell lymphomas. Furthermore, targeting extrinsic factors such as FasL or TRAIL to the tumor cell surface triggers death receptors, inducing apoptosis by both autocrine and paracrine processes.

Nakagawa grew up in the K≈çjimachi area of Edo (modern-day Tokyo), and studied botany under Tamura Ransui (Áî∞Êùë ËóçÊ∞¥). He developed a strong interest in Dutch products, science and culture, and visited the Dutch trading post at Dejima, Nagasaki a number of times, where he also studied the Dutch language. During his time as Tamura's pupil, Nakagawa became quite involved in the rangaku community. He helped revise some of Hiraga Gennai's works, including a taxonomic work called Butsurui Hinshitsu. He also helped in the development of such technologies as fire-resistant cloth and thermometers. Nakagawa began corresponding with Carl Peter Thunberg in 1776.

The first definition is the most common in the recent literature. The designation \\"Hankel matrix\\" is often used for matrices satisfying the property in the second definition.  Definition 1  Symmetry pattern of a persymmetric 5√ó5 matrix Let A = (aij) be an n √ó n matrix. The first definition of persymmetric requires that : a_{ij} = a_{n-j+1,n-i+1} for all i, j.. See page 193. For example, 5-by-5 persymmetric matrices are of the form : A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} & a_{14} & a_{15}  a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & a_{24} & a_{14}  a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} & a_{23} & a_{13}  a_{41} & a_{42} & a_{32} & a_{22} & a_{12}  a_{51} & a_{41} & a_{31} & a_{21} & a_{11} \\\\end{bmatrix}. This can be equivalently expressed as AJ = JAT where J is the exchange matrix. A symmetric matrix is a matrix whose values are symmetric in the northwest-to-southeast diagonal. If a symmetric matrix is rotated by 90¬∞, it becomes a persymmetric matrix. Symmetric persymmetric matrices are sometimes called bisymmetric matrices.  Definition 2  The second definition is due to Thomas Muir. It says that the square matrix A = (aij) is persymmetric if aij depends only on i + j. Persymmetric matrices in this sense, or Hankel matrices as they are often called, are of the form : A = \\\\begin{bmatrix} r_1 & r_2 & r_3 & \\\\cdots & r_n  r_2 & r_3 & r_4 & \\\\cdots & r_{n+1}  r_3 & r_4 & r_5 & \\\\cdots & r_{n+2}  \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots  r_n & r_{n+1} & r_{n+2} & \\\\cdots & r_{2n-1} \\\\end{bmatrix}.

It is one of the oldest of its kind in Europe. It was founded in 1663 by David Teniers the Younger, painter to the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm and Don Juan of Austria. Teniers was master of the Guild of St Luke ‚Äî which embraced arts and some handicrafts ‚Äî and petitioned Philip IV of Spain, then master of the Spanish Netherlands, to grant a royal charter to establish a Fine Arts Academy in Antwerp. It houses the Antwerp Fashion Academy. 19th century The Royal Academy developed into an internationally acclaimed institute for Fine Arts, Architecture and Design. From the nineteenth century on, the academy attracted young artists from abroad. Irish, German, Dutch, Polish artists looking for a solid classical training found their way to Antwerp. Under the direction of Gustave Wappers (1803-1874) and his registrar Hendrik Conscience, the academy faced significant restructuring. The academy's significant art collection was exhibited in its own gallery space. By 1890, this gallery would develop into the Royal Museum of Fine Arts (Dutch; Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten) and would move to its current location in Antwerp. In 1880, a promising young artist Henry Van de Velde enrolled at the Antwerp Academy. He would become one of the pioneering 20th century architects and designers. In 1885 and 1886, Vincent van Gogh was also to spend a short time at the Antwerp academy, prior to his departure to France. In 1885, King Leopold II commissioned the establishment of the National Higher Institute for Fine Arts Antwerp (Nationaal Hoger Instituut voor Schone Kunsten) as a unique post graduate program, inspired by the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. 20th and 21st centuries In 1946, the Architecture program became an independent institute, The National Higher Institute of Architecture. Another key moment in the history of the academy would be 1963. A unique new course ‚ÄòFashion Design‚Äô started. This course was moderately successful from the beginning, but became world leading in the early eighties. ‚ÄúThe Antwerp Six‚Äù with Dirk Bikkembergs, Walter Van Beirendonck, Marina Yee, Dries Van Noten, Dirk Van Saene and Ann Demeulemeester were hot issue in the media. Stylistically extremely diverse, these young friends had a huge impact on the contemporary fashion scene. The fashion program attracted more and more talents from all over the globe. With over 130 students it's by far the largest program in the visual arts and design department. In 1995, the Flemish higher educational system faced a radical metamorphosis. The Antwerp Academy and the Henry Van de Velde Institute were included as faculties in a bigger college structure, The University College of Antwerp (Dutch: Hogeschool Antwerpen). However, the Higher Institute of Fine Arts was kept independent and to develop into a separate entity.[Een tempel bouwen voor de muzen, een korte geschiedenis van de Antwerpse Academie by Jan Lampo, April 1995] [1885/1985 een eeuw Nationaal Hoger Instituut voor Schone Kunsten te Antwerpen by L.Theo van Looj, 1985/411/7] The Academy nowadays offers three distinctive programs: Visual Arts and Design, Conservation studies and a one-year dedicated teachers training. A body of 540 students (of whom 230 are international) work in the four main buildings located in the heart of the city: Mutsaardstraat (Photography, Silversmithing/Jewelry, Theatre Costume Design and Fine Arts), Nationalestraat (fashion) and Keizerstraat (graphic design). As of September 2013, the programs are offered by the \\"Artesis Plantijn Hogeschool Antwerpen\\", a fusion between Artesis Hogeschool Antwerpen and Plantijn Hogeschool.

Antwerp, Nurse of Painters, by Theodoor Boeyermans (1665; 188 x 454 cm), promotes the city's recent artistic past. Portraits of Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck watch over students as they practise the arts. At the centre is the allegorical Antverpia pictorum nutrix (\\"Antwerp, nurse of painters\\"). Chronos accompanies other young students who present their artwork. The river god Scaldis, a personification of Antwerp's river Scheldt, symbolises with his cornucopia the wealth and bounty of the city's artistic heritage.

It is an Fc receptor which is similar in structure to the MHC class I molecule and also associates with beta-2-microglobulin. Further studies revealed a similar receptor in humans, leading to the naming as a neonatal Fc receptor. In humans, however, it is found in the placenta to help facilitate transport of mother's IgG to the growing fetus. It has also been shown to play a role in monitoring IgG and serum albumin turnover. Neonatal Fc receptor expression is up-regulated by the proinflammatory cytokine, TNF-Œ±, and down-regulated by IFN-Œ≥.  Interactions with IgG and serum albumin  FCGRT has been shown to interact with Human serum albumin.. FcRn-mediated transcytosis of IgG across epithelial cells is possible because FcRn binds IgG at acidic pH (<6.5) but not at neutral or higher pH. Therefore, FcRn can bind IgG from the slightly acidic intestinal lumen and ensure efficient, unidirectional transport to the basolateral side where the pH is neutral to slightly basic.  Recycling of IgG and serum albumin  FcRn extends the half-life of IgG and serum albumin by reducing lysosomal degradation in endothelial cells and bone-marrow derived cells. IgG, serum albumin and other serum proteins are continuously internalized through pinocytosis. Generally, serum proteins are transported from the endosomes to the lysosome, where they are degraded. The two most abundant serum proteins, IgG and serum albumin are bound by FcRn at the slightly acidic pH (<6.5), and recycled to the cell surface where they are released at the neutral pH (>7.0) of blood. In this way IgG and serum albumin avoids lysosomal degradation. This mechanism provides an explanation for the greater serum circulation half-life of IgG and serum albumin.  Role in various organs  FcRn is expressed on antigen-presenting leukocytes like dendritic cells and is also expressed in neutrophils to help clear opsonized bacteria. In the kidneys, FcRn is expressed on epithelial cells called podocytes to prevent IgG and albumin from clogging the glomerular filtration barrier. Current studies are investigating FcRn in the liver because there are relatively low concentrations of both IgG and albumin in liver bile despite high concentrations in the blood. Studies have shown that FcRn-mediated transcytosis is involved with the trafficking of the HIV-1 virus across genital tract epithelium.  Half-life extension of therapeutic proteins  It has been shown that conjugation of some drugs to the Fc domain of IgG or serum albumin significantly increases their half-life. There are several drugs on the market that have Fc portions fused to the effector proteins in order to increase their half-lives through FcRn. They include: Amevive (alefacept), Arcalyst (rilonacept), Enbrel (etanercept), Nplate (romiplostim), Orencia (abatacept) and Nulojix (belatacept) . Enbrel (etanercept) was the first successful IgG Fc-linked soluble receptor therapeutic and works by binding and neutralizing the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNF-Œ±.  Therapeutic potential  Several autoimmune disorders are caused by the reaction of IgG to self antigens. Since FcRn extends IgG half-life in the circulation, it can also extend the half-life of these pathogenic antibodies and promote autoimmune disease. New therapies seek to disrupt the IgG-FcRn interaction to increase the clearance of disease-causing IgG autoantibodies from the body. One such therapy is the infusion of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) to saturate FcRn's IgG recycling capacity and proportionately reduce the levels of disease-causing IgG autoantibody binding to FcRn, thereby increasing disease- causing IgG autoantibody removal. This strategy of blocking the binding of autoantibodies to FcRn by injecting higher affinity antibodies can help prevent inflammation in response to self antigen.

Way was drafted by the Giants in the sixth round of the 1995 NFL Draft, and played in five games his rookie year. Primarily used as a fullback, blocking for Rodney Hampton, Way finished the year with 71 total yards (65 of which was receiving yards) and one touchdown, scoring in week six. Way started 13 games his second year, again primarily used as a blocker. He scored two touchdowns and finished the year with 79 rushing yards and 328 receiving yards. Career Way's breakout year was in 1997. Given the starting halfback job after Hampton went down with an injury, Way made the most of his opportunity, rushing for 696 yards and gaining 1,001 all purpose yards, and scored five touchdowns (four rushing). He also rushed for 114 yards against Arizona in week twelve, the only time in his career that he broke the century mark. Way's contributions helped lead the Giants to the division championship and a home playoff game against the Minnesota Vikings, but the Giants blew a 19‚Äì3 lead and lost the game 23‚Äì22. Way's numbers fell off slightly in 1998, but he still managed to score four touchdowns and rush for 432 yards. His career was halted by a chronic knee injury, and he announced his retirement in 2000. Post-playing Career Way currently works for the NFL as head of its Player Engagement Department. Prior to joining the NFL in July 2014, Way spent 14 years with the Giants as their Director of Player Development.

Education and experience The mastering engineer is responsible for a final edit of a product and preparation for manufacturing copies. Although there are no official requirements to work as an audio mastering engineer, practitioners often have comprehensive domain knowledge of audio engineering, and in many cases, may hold an audio or acoustic engineering degree. Most audio engineers master music or speech audio material. The best mastering engineers might possess arrangement and record production skills, allowing them to 'trouble- shoot' mix issues and improve the final sound. Generally, good mastering skills are based on experience, resulting from many years of practice. Equipment Generally, mastering engineers use a combination of specialized audio-signal processors, low-distortion-high-bandwidth loudspeakers (and corresponding amplifiers with which to drive them), within a dedicated, acoustically-optimized playback environment. The equipment and processors used within the field of mastering are almost entirely dedicated to the purpose; engineered to a high-standard, often possessing low signal-to-noise ratios [at nominal operating levels] and in many cases, the incorporation of parameter- recall, such as indented potentiometers, or in some more-sophisticated designs, via a digital-controller. Some advocates for digital software claim that plug-ins are capable of processing audio in a mastering context, though without the same degree of signal degradation as those introduced from processors within the analogue domain. The quality of the results varies according to the algorithms used within these processors, which in some cases, can introduce distortions entirely exclusive to the digital-domain. Frequency spectrum analyzers, phase oscilloscopes, and also peak, RMS, VU and 'K' meters are frequently used within the audio analysis stage of the process as a means of rendering a visual representation of the audio, or signal, being analysed. Aspects of their work Most mastering engineer accolades are given for their ability to make a mix consistent with respect to subjective factors based on the perception of listeners, regardless of their playback systems and the environment. This is a difficult task due to the varieties of systems now available and the effect it has on the apparent qualitative attributes of the recording. For instance, a recording that sounds great on one speaker/amplifier combination playing CD audio, may sound drastically different on a computer-based system playing back a low-bitrate MP3. Some engineers maintain that the main mastering engineer's task is to improve upon playback systems translations while the position of others is to make a sonic impact. Prolonged periods of listening to improperly mastered recordings usually leads to hearing fatigue that ultimately takes the pleasure out of the listening experience. A professional mastering engineer renders mixes that have a good harmonic balance. Harmonic balancing can be accomplished by correcting and removing tonal imbalances. Once corrected or removed, the audio will be much more pleasurable for listening. This is a fundamental aspect to a mastering engineer's job and the reason why many consider mastering to be a form of art as well as an \\"audio engineering\\" discipline.

As a Sophomore in 1981, Hilger guided the Cowboys to its first post-season bowl since 1976 against Texas A&M; in the Independence bowl. In 1982, Hilger suffered a shoulder injury prior to the start of season earning him a redshirt as the Cowboys fell to a 4-5-2 record. Returning to the starting lineup in 1983, the Cowboys finished 8-4 and Hilger was recognized as the Most Valuable Player in the 1983 Bluebonnet Bowl. In 1984, Hilger and the OSU Cowboys would change the course of Oklahoma State football. The Cowboys opened the season with a 45-3 victory over top ranked Arizona State University, earning Hilger Big-8 \\"Player of the Week\\" honors. The Cowboys only losses came on the road against #1 ranked Nebraska and #2 ranked Oklahoma to finish with a 10-2 record, the best finish and highest ranking (#6) in school history.

Hilger and University of Nevada, Las Vegas quarterback Randall Cunningham were teamed with (1984 National Champion) head coach LaVell Edwards of Brigham Young University. For the first time, Hilger's skills were on display in a pro-style offense and under the watchful eyes of NFL owners, coaches, and scouts. NFL career With the 143rd pick of the 1985 NFL Draft, Al Davis and the Los Angeles Raiders selected Rusty Hilger. Hilger, at the time, was the only Raider rookie quarterback to ever enter a regular season game and throw a touchdown pass. After two seasons as a backup to Jim Plunkett and Marc Wilson, Al Davis named Hilger as the starting quarterback for the 1987 season making him the youngest starting quarterback in Raider franchise history. Hilger and the Raiders opened the season 2-0 before the 1987 NFL Players Association strike halted play, and replacement players took the field. The Raiders would finish the 1987 season with a 5-10 record, their worst since 1963. In 1988, Hilger underwent a knee surgery that changed the course of his career and led to his termination from the Raiders. After missing the first five games of the 1988 season, Hilger signed with the Detroit Lions despite failing his physical. Only six days after arriving in Detroit, Hilger was forced into action. Without a grasp of the playbook, Hilger managed to call plays, attempt a career-high 43 passes, and toss a touchdown in the 24-7 loss against the Chicago Bears. By seasons end, Hilger was named as the Lions Offensive MVP for the 1988 season. In 1989, the Lions released Hilger due to his bone-on-bone knee condition. In 1990, Hilger teamed with former Raiders Head Coach Tom Flores and the Seattle Seahawks. The Seahawks released Hilger prior to the season opener and he was picked up by former Raiders Offensive Coordinator Larry Kennan and the Indianapolis Colts. Hilger signed with the Indianapolis Colts and spent the remainder of the season with the Colts. At season's end, Coach Larry Kennan joined former Raider Head Coach Tom Flores in Seattle. Hilger remained under contract with the Colts until being released just days before the 1991 season opener. He then re-signed with the Seahawks for the 1991 and 1992 seasons.

The oldest and biggest Masonic Grand Lodge in Denmark is the Danish Order of Freemasons (), in English also known as the Grand Lodge of Denmark.  History  Freemasonry came to Denmark in 1743 with the founding of the Lodge of St. Martin. Named after Martin of Tours, the Lodge was founded in Copenhagen by several Danish Masons, who were also members of Grand Lodges abroad. 1745 saw the founding of Denmark's second Lodge, Zorobabel, also in Copenhagen. From Copenhagen, Freemasonry began to spread throughout the Kingdom of Denmark- Norway with the founding in 1749 of the Lodge St. Olai in Oslo as well as Lodges in Bergen and Trondheim. In 1767 St. Martin and Zorobabel merged to form Zorobabel til Nordstjernen. This Lodge took over St. Martin's role as Mother Lodge to the Freemasons' Lodges in Norway. In 1855 Zorobabel til Nordstjernen merged with the Lodge of Friedrich zur Gekr√∂nten Hoffnung (founded in 1778) to form the Lodge of Zorobabel og Frederik til det kronede Haab (Z & F for short). This happened less than a year after the founding of St. Martin, on June 3d 1744. At that time, the Freemasons decided not to publish a public registry of members and to keep the minutes of the Lodge a secret. The kings successor to the throne, Christian VII of Denmark had met several Freemasons on his Grand Tour of Europe during the 1760s, including Benjamin Franklin in London and Jean le Rond d'Alembert, Denis Diderot, Claude Adrien Helv√©tius and Baron d'Holbach in Paris. Although wanting to become a Mason himself, his deteriorated mental health meant that he was never initiated. Many of his successors however were Freemasons and held the title of Viseste Salomo Vicarius or Grand Master: Frederick VII of Denmark, Frederick VIII of Denmark and Christian X of Denmark. Following a power struggle with Gustav III of Sweden on the issue of who had the right to exercise control of the Danish Order of Freemasons, Christian VII on 29 April 1780 used his power of government to issue and an order-in-council declaring, that Freemasons throughout Denmark, Norway, Schleswig and Holstein, were prohibited from recognising any foreign prince as head of the order. During the absolute monarchy, the Crown acted as a protector of Freemasonry in Denmark. However, following the adoption of a constitution build on classical liberal principles and the departure from absolutism in 1848, the protected status was lost.  Rituals and rites  From its very beginning in 1743, Freemasonry was decentralised, with lodges using rituals of what is most likely English origin. In 1747, Freemasons established a Danish-Norwegian provincial grand lodge, with Christian Conrad Danneskiold-Laurvig as grand master. This provincial grand lodge was abolished in 1765, following the successful attempt by the grand master himself and others, to introduce the Rite of Strict Observance; a chivalric brand of Freemasonry created in Germany by Karl Gotthelf von Hund. Following the death of von Hund in 1776, this system collapsed. Strict Observance was abolished following the Congress of Wilhelmsbad in 1782. The Danish Order of Freemasons has chosen to retain certain elements of Strict Observance within its high-degree system, as opposed to Freemasonic orders today adhering to the Swedish Rite. The Rectified Rite was inspired by the Rectified Scottish Rite, which was introduced into continental Freemasonry as a replacement for Strict Observance, at the Masonic Congress of Wilhelmsbad in 1782. Because of disagreement at the congress on how to implement the higher degrees, the Danish delegation returned home before the issue was resolved, opting instead to introduce only the three agreed upon craft-degrees. Since there was no clarification as to what to do with the higher degrees, the Strict Observance Grand Chapter continued its work. Finally, in 1817, Prince Carl von Hessen- Kassel, then grand master, established a Scots St. Andrews lodge. Like Strict Observance, the Swedish Rite was a system of chivalric Freemasonry created by the swede Carl Frederik Eckleff during the mid-1760s. Freemasons from the lodge Kosmos in Elsinore wanted to introduce the rituals in Denmark, having experienced the rituals themselves in Swedish. They attained the permission of King Frederick VII, acting as grand master, and began the practice in 1852. In 1858 the king, himself having experienced the rituals, founded the Grand Lodge of Denmark, working the highest Templar degrees in Copenhagen. Since 1858, the Danish Order of Freemasons has practiced the rituals of the Swedish Rite. The Rite is divided into three divisions: St. John's (Craft) degrees (I‚ÄìIII), St. Andrew's (Scottish) degrees (IV‚ÄìVI) and the Chapter degrees (VII‚ÄìX). Besides the Danish Order of Freemasons, a variety of fraternal organizations practice Freemasonry, using different Masonic rites. Two of these organizations are recognized by the Danish Order of Freemasons as regular, and they, in return, recognize the Grand Master of the Danish Order of Freemasons as their own grand master: The Danish Craft Masonry of Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons () work the three craft degrees following the English Emulation Ritual, while The Union of Johannes Lodges () work the three craft degrees following the rite created by Friedrich Ludwig Schr√∂der. Among the other organizations, the English system is used by the independent Masonic Order of the Circle (), while the Order of Sct. Andrews () and the Order of Serapion () each use their own rites. Grand Lodge of Denmark of Ancient Free & Accepted Masons () ‚Äì not to be confused with the Danish Order of Freemasons, which is recognized as the grand lodge of Denmark by the United Grand Lodge of England - practice Ritus Hauniensis, a Danish system comparable to the York Rite. It is associated with the independent Great Orient, which work in accordance with the Scottish 33. degree system.  Masonic orders in Denmark  = Danish Order of Freemasons = The Danish Grand Lodge-headquarters in Copenhagen The Danish Order of Freemasons () (abbr.: DDFO) was founded on 16 November 1858 and is the main governing body of regular Freemasonry in Denmark. With around 8,000 members, it is the largest Masonic order in the country. In English, the order is known colloquially as the Grand Lodge of Denmark, though this is not a direct translation of its name. In addition, the order should not be confused with the much smaller and irregular Grand Lodge of Denmark of Ancient Free & Accepted Masons (). The Danish Order of Freemasons has 89 lodges in 45 cities, all practicing the rituals of the Swedish Rite.https://grailquest.wordpress.com/tag/danish-order-of-freemasons/ The Rite is divided into three divisions: # St. John's (Craft) degrees (I‚ÄìIII) # St. Andrew's (Scottish) degrees (IV‚ÄìVI) # Chapter degrees (VII‚ÄìX). The Swedish Rite demands members be Christian and not just that they believe in a supreme being. Like other Regular Masonic jurisdictions, only men are allowed membership. Within the Danish Order of Freemasons are two quasi-autonomous orders, neither of which requires its members to produce a Christian certificate of baptism: * The Danish Craft Masonry of Ancient, Free and Accepted Masons. () (abbr.: DDFL) has 42 lodges and practises the English Emulation Ritual. In 2012 seven members of Logen De Drie Hamre nr. 815 in the DDFL started up the only English-speaking Danish Freemasons lodge in Copenhagen, namely Lodge 850 Cosmopolitan. * The Union of Johannes Lodges () has three lodges and practises the Schr√∂der Rite created by Friedrich Ludwig Schr√∂der. Members of the Danish Order of Freemasons, the Danish Craft Masonry, and the Union of Johannes Lodges have mutual visiting privileges. Since both Danish Craft Masonry and Union only work the three degrees of craft Masonry, its members are invited to join the Order of Freemasons with respect to its higher degrees. = Grand Lodge of Denmark of Ancient Free & Accepted Masons = There is a fourth masonic obedience in Denmark, not within the Danish Order of Freemasons. The Grand Lodge of Denmark of Ancient Free & Accepted Masons () was established in 1929. It follows the tradition of Orient or Continental Freemasonry and works in accordance to a ritual based on the York Rite (modified version of the 1929 Ritus Hauniensis written by Grunddal Sjallung).

Licensed to Englewood, Ohio, United States, the station serves the Dayton area. The station is currently owned and operated by Aloha Station Trust. Its studios are located in Kettering, Ohio (with a Dayton address) and its transmitter is in west Dayton. Early history WYDB was originally given the call sign WKET in 1962 airing classical music from a basement studio at the former Hills and Dales Shopping Center. The station failed to attract a sizable listening audience (AM was the dominant band at that time) and was later sold to the University of Dayton in 1964 and changed the call letters to WVUD (for the \\"Voice of the University of Dayton\\"). The WKET calls are now used at 98.3 FM in Kettering.http://www.kettering.k12.oh.us/WKET =FM-100 WVUD \\"The Radio Station\\"= In the 1970s WVUD became Dayton's first album oriented rock station, providing an alternative to Top 40-formatted WING. The station leveraged a 50,000-watt transmitter and a 500-foot tower (situated on Stuart Hill, the highest point on the university's campus) allowing the station's signal to reach well into eastern Indiana and northern Kentucky, gaining a wide and extremely loyal listening audience in the tri-state area. While the station's management, programmers and sales staff were all seasoned radio professionals, the air staff consisted solely of University of Dayton students. From the late 1960s through the mid-1970s, WVUD's General Manager was University of Dayton Communication Arts Department Chairman George Biersack. Biersack hired former WVUD staffer and UD grad Chris Cage (Caggiano) from WING as the station's Program Director and Biersack's marching orders for Cage were to \\"grab the 18- to 34-year-olds\\" but to \\"avoid that WING sound\\". Cage's Music Director was Kevin Carroll, who went on to work for several major record labels. Cage was succeeded by Geoff Vargo, and Carroll was replaced by Dan Covey, who later landed at WING. In its heyday (the mid-to-late 1970s), WVUD-FM competed with WTUE-FM for dominance of the Dayton market. Utilizing a strategy of first-to-market \\"breaking\\" of new songs, a vast collection of record albums, and a lengthy song-rotation schedule (to keep the sound \\"fresh\\"), the station competed on its diversity of music and the disc jockeys' knowledge of artists and bands. The station enjoyed stature and cache sufficient that touring major rock acts, such as Jackson Browne, Shawn Phillips, and Billy Joel, were interviewed live in-studio. Students staffed on-air slots and handled news and sports programming content as well. Over the years, WVUD air personalities such as Steve Wendell, Dan Covey, Art Farkas, Alan McConnell, Dan Pugh (later known as Dan Patrick), Bill Andres, Bill Pugh, \\"Dolby\\" Joe Reiling, Steve Downes, Lou Chelekis, Rich Wieser (The Weezer), Patty Spittler, Michael Luczak, Mary Kuzan, Steve Kerrigan, Jim Tobin (Yost), Keith Wright, Sandy Huff, Dave McGuire (Vadnais), Jim Biggins, Joe Rittman, Dan Ross, Bob Eidem and Mark Zona competed successfully with much more experienced radio pros in the Dayton market. After graduation, many WVUD \\"alumni\\" went on to attain significant professional career success in radio nationwide. On April 1, 1977, the station spoofed listeners, claiming it had, overnight, changed formats to big-band 1940s music. Complaints to station management from loyal, if disgruntled, listeners were counted into the hundreds. So convincing was the transformation, that many did not realize it was an \\"April Fool's\\" joke. To listeners' delight, normal operations resumed the next day. One of WVUD listeners' favorite programs was Wax Museum, where a complete rock album was played from beginning to end without interruption. DJs hosting \\"Wax\\" encouraged listeners to record the album off-air and even provided calibration tones (\\"set your recording levels to minus three db\\") and signals to begin and pause recording. (The signal was a guitar strum taken from the Yes song \\"Roundabout\\".) Popular station jingles included \\"It's a real nice way to spend a day in Dayton, Ohio\\" (from Randy Newman) and \\"Turn on your radio, listen to my song\\" (from Harry Nilssen). In addition, the station aired a popular talk program for young married couples called Christian Marriage, moderated by Father Norbert Burns, a popular long-time University of Dayton instructor and professor, now retired. Also, at least through 1982, the station provided Saturday and Sunday morning air time to ethnic music: \\"Music of Hungary\\" (with Al Kertez) and \\"Music of India\\" (with Parmada Singh Sihoda) were aired for years. In 1976, WTUE (then owned by Group One Broadcasting) abandoned its Top 40 format in favor of an album-oriented format in order to compete directly with WVUD. Eventually, as the 1980s dawned, WTUE started to win the ratings war (in large part by hiring former WVUD air talent as they graduated and were no longer eligible to work for the university-owned station). In 1982, in an effort to boost lost ratings, WVUD switched to a \\"Contemporary Hit\\" format and the \\"AOR era\\" at the station was over. While loyal listeners and station personnel mourned the loss, the station continued to garner respectable (though not overwhelming) ratings into the latter part of the 1980s. The university sold WVUD-FM in 1992, and the WVUD call letters were subsequently adopted by another college radio station in Delaware (The University of Delaware). =99.9 LITE FM/Lite 94.5= WVUD was eventually sold by UD in 1992 becoming WLQT (Lite 100) after a brief stint as a contemporary hit station before competitor WGTZ-FM(Z-93) emerged in 1985. It changed its name to Lite 99.9 in 1993 under the direction of programmer Scott Barrett. WLQT subsequently became part of the Jacor Dayton cluster (later merging with Clear Channel.) Aside from its light rock and HD oldies frequency, WLQT has aired Christmas music every year during the holidays since 1993 until its call sign change in 2013. Jacor Regional Programmer Vance Dillard was one of the first to believe in 24/7 Christmas music. WLQT was one of the first stations in the country to take this programming risk, and proved that the format is a ratings-winner. 99.9 LITE FM was awarded the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) Crystal Award for Excellence in Public Service in 2002. Over 13,000 stations are eligible for the distinction, and only 10 station per year are awarded at the NAB Radio Show conference in Las Vegas, Nevada. Dayton's Kim Faris became the morning show host of LITE 99.9 in June 2007. The station was also home to the Delilah After Dark show (save for a brief period in the middle of 2011, where the station moved to 94.5). On Oct. 5 2009, LITE 99.9 changed its positioner to 99.9 LITE FM. On May 24, 2011, Clear Channel announced that Top 40/CHR sister station WDKF would swap signals with WLQT, thus giving the former more signal coverage in the Dayton area.Frequency swap in Dayton from Radioinsight.com (May 24, 2011) With the change, the station shifted its longtime adult contemporary format to that of a more gold-based approach, playing soft hits from artists such as Celine Dion, The Carpenters, Elton John, and Phil Collins. One year later, WLQT backed away from the \\"MOR\\" artists and shifted back to a more contemporary AC format with the re-addition of current tracks to the station's playlist. =Country music= At Noon on July 3, 2013, after playing \\"We Said Hello Goodbye\\" by Phil Collins, WLQT suddenly terminated its longtime adult contemporary format and flipped to Country as \\"Hot Country B94.5\\". Lite's Off, Country On for Dayton \\"B\\" launched with \\"The Only Way I Know\\" by Jason Aldean. Kim Farris, the morning host, was retained and transferred to afternoons. The call sign changed to WYDB on August 23, 2013. WYDB relaunched a WLQT-branded HD2 subchannel in September 2015, initially stunting with Christmas music.http://hdradio.com/station_guides/widget.php?id=58 Previous logo Image:WLQT logo.png (WLQT's logo under previous 99.9 frequency) References External links *B 94.5 * Greater Cincinnati Radio Guide * YDB Category:Country radio stations in the United States Category:University of Dayton Category:Radio stations established in 1992 Category:1962 establishments in Ohio Category:IHeartMedia radio stations ","title":"WYDB"},{"id":"10535909","text":"Fontenay-Tr√©signy is a commune in the Seine-et-Marne department in the √éle-de- France region in north-central France.

According to an Albanian blog AACL, he was assassinated while he stopped at a traffic light in Brussels, by three Yugoslavians allegedly working for State Security Administration (UDBA). This happened in the commune of Saint-Gilles, at the crossroads between the rue St Bernard and the rue de la Victoire. He lived in Brussels since 1972 where he worked to put on agenda the human rights of Albanians in Kosovo.030429ED The killers were Andrija Lakoniƒá, Veselin Vukotiƒá and Darko A≈°anin.

Same year he was killed in Serbia. Veselin Vukotiƒá was arrested in Spain in 2006. According to Spanish police, Vukotiƒá in addition to killing Enver Hadri, also had documents incriminating former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá in numerous assassinations. In April 2003, a protected U.N. war crimes prosecution witness who said he had worked for Yugoslavia's secret service claimed in Milo≈°eviƒá's trial in The Hague that Vukotiƒá once admitted to killing Hadri.

It is positioned about 38¬∞ above the galactic plane at a vertical distance of about and thus has little extinction from intervening interstellar dust. This object was first recorded as a star-like feature by Joseph Lalande on March 22, 1799. However, credit for the discovery of a nebula goes to Wilhelm Struve in 1825. John L. E. Dreyer described it as, \\"a planetary nebula, very bright, very small, round, disc and border\\". This nebula is \\"very amorphous and irregular\\" in shape, but forms a rough ellipsoid. It consists of two parts; a bright inner region filled with arches and filaments spanning , and a larger and fainter outer volume that has a pair of \\"tubular\\" structures. The inner region has an expansion velocity ranging over 19‚Äì24 km/s. The emission from the outer part of the nebula is only about 1% of the total. The central star has an apparent visual magnitude of 12.66 and the spectrum matches a hydrogen-rich star of type O(H). It has an estimated temperature of . The abundances of the nebula suggest a low initial mass for the central star, probably . Outflow from this star has been measured with velocities of , and the estimated mass loss rate is yr‚àí1. There appears to be a collaminated jet feature to the northwest, suggesting the central star is ejecting material along two and possibly four such directions.

They have reserved for themselves the Abitibi Indian Reserve No. 70 on the south end of Lake Abitibi. In January 2008, the First Nation had 270 people registered with the nation, of which their on-reserve population was 121. History The first recorded reference to the native people about Lake Abitibi was in The Jesuit Relations in 1640. They were a nomadic group of hunter-gatherers, whose traditional territory straddled a large segment of what is now northeastern Ontario and northwestern Quebec. Their hunting and trapping grounds extended and still extend east and northeast of Long Sault to Pierre, Harris, and Montreuil Lakes in Ontario, and on a parallel line into Quebec and as far east as Amos. The southernmost limit of the territory was a little south of Kirkland Lake in Ontario and Rouyn In Quebec. Cochrane, Ontario is the approximately western boundary. Abitibi/Abitibis (Cree) and Timiskaming/T√©miscamingues (Algonquin) territories in the seventeenth century. The Abitibi Indian Reserve No. 70 was created when the James Bay Treaty (Treaty 9) was signed at the Hudson's Bay Company post on Lake Abitibi in Quebec on June 7, 1906. It encompasses , or . However, the treaty commissioners revealed that they were only authorized to negotiate with the Anishinaabe whose hunting grounds were in Ontario. The Abitibi Indians who were part of the same group, but whose hunting territory lay within Quebec, were told that negotiations for a reserve for them would occur later, but the Quebec government stalled that process for a considerable time after a treaty was signed with the Ontario band. Two years after the signing of the James Bay Treaty the Canadian federal government still had not been able to get Quebec to set aside a reserve for the Quebec Indians. It then arranged with the Quebec government to bring them under Treaty 9, which meant that they would receive annuities and would share in the revenues allocated to Abitibi 70, and income from this reserve was, and still is, divided on a per capita basis. This is the origin of much of the economic disparity that Wahgoshig First Nation contends with today; due to the way disbursements are set up through the federal government's intervention into their affairs, the Wahgoshig people receive only a minor share of any revenue that they may generate from natural resources on Wahgoshig Reserve. This has proved to be a disincentive towards developing the on-reserve natural resources. Until 1972, the Department of Indian Affairs in Quebec administered the affairs of both the Abitibi-Dominion Band of Abitibi Indians (located in Quebec) and the Abitibi-Ontario Band of Abitibi Indians. From 1972 onward, Indian Affairs in Sudbury, Ontario, took over the affairs of the Abitibi-Ontario band. In 1979, the Abitibi-Dominion Band changed its name to Abitibiwinni First Nation, and the Abitibi-Ontario Band became Wahgoshig First Nation. Governance The Wahgoshig First Nation have a Custom Electoral system of government. Elected officials have 4-year terms. The current elected officials consists of Chief Joel \\"Bear\\" Babin and six Councillors: Dave Morris, Chris Sackaney, Dannah Ellison, Shawna Malette, Joseph Matthews and Paul McKenzie. The Chief's term began in April 2016 and the Council's term began in June 2016. As a signatory to Treaty 9, the First Nation is a member of the Wabun Tribal Council, a Regional Chief's Council who is a member of the Nishnawbe Aski Nation, a Tribal Political Organization representing majority of First Nations in Northern Ontario. However, the Wahgoshig First Nation is a political member of the Algonquin Anishinabeg Nation Tribal Council since November 2000, together with other nations which Wahgoshig First Nation maintained strong historical ties. There is an on- reserve village that occupies about 25 ha of the 70 ha flat land. West of the village, the land becomes undulating and it contains many wet swampy areas - ideal moose habitat. Moose, bears, grouse and other game are quite abundant in the area. The reserve is served by Highway 101, which provides access to the 5.8 km long reserve road, approximately 50 km east of Matheson, Ontario, within a few miles of the western Quebec border. The north end of the reserve meets the south shore of Lake Abitibi, which separates the two provinces. :::N/A = Data Not Available. =Services= For the Abitibi village of about 25 ha, the First Nation provides the following services: * band office * health clinic * warehouse / fire hall * public works garage * community hall Wahgoshig is policed by the Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service, an Aboriginal-based service.

In 2007 the government of the Comunidad de Madrid awarded the Prize for Tolerance to Montaner, a distinction that is awarded to those who have fought for the freedom and respect for human rights. Cuba, Espa√±a y el futuro. El imperio fracasado de Castro tiene pocas salidas El Mundo Lunes, 15 de enero de 1996. A√ëO VIII NUMERO 2.253 Career After taking a master's degree at the University of Miami, Montaner taught American literature at the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico from 1966 to 1970. During those years he published four books: Los combatientes (1968), Gald√≥s humorista (1969), P√≥ker de brujas (1970), and Instant√°neas al borde del abismo (1970). The last two were also published in English. Montaner began his career in journalism in 1968, working with Joaqu√≠n Maur√≠n, a Spanish exile who had founded the American Literary Agency in New York City at the end of the 1940s with the objective of disseminating democratic ideas in the United States and Latin America. Maur√≠n was a noted Marxist theorist whose thinking had evolved toward liberal democracy after the Spanish Civil War. Montaner began writing a weekly column which was soon appearing in almost every Latin American country, often in the most widely read newspapers. He also came to be much in demand as a lecturer throughout the hemisphere, speaking about the defense of liberty, economic development, and the important role of culture in the evolution of societies. =1970s= By 1970, his success as a columnist and speaker had made it possible for him to move on from teaching to a life in Madrid dedicated to his columns and books. He established a publishing house, Editorial Playor, in 1972. His first novel, Perromundo, was published in 1972 and subsequently was made into a movie. His Informe secreto sobre la revoluci√≥n cubana was published in 1975, and was followed a year later by 200 a√±os de gringos, celebrating the bicentennial of the United States and contrasting the evolution of the United States with that of Latin America. This contrast between the levels of development north and south of the Rio Grande and the reasons for it would occupy much of his attention thereafter. As Spain moved rapidly toward democracy after the death of Franco, he joined the Liberal Club of Madrid. =1980s= In the 1980s, Montaner began a weekly television commentary that was aired by satellite throughout Latin America. He also produced three books: Fidel Castro y la revoluci√≥n cubana, subsequently published in English, Italian, and Russian; La agon√≠a de Am√©rica; and 1898: La trama. In 1980 he received the ABC prize for journalism, awarded by the then Spanish premier Adolfo Su√°rez. By then, his columns were being published in a number of newspapers in the United States, and the Miami Herald invited him to join its editorial board.James Crawford (1992), Language loyalties: a source book on the official English controversy, University of Chicago Press He also edited the opinion page of El Nuevo Herald between 1987 and 1989. =1990s= In 1990, comments Montaner made on the television show Portada on the Univision network were perceived as offensive to Puerto Ricans. The president of Univision, Mr. Joaquin Blaya, supported Montaner, who explained his comment in an article later published in Wall Street Journal. The controversy resulted in El Diario La Prensa dropping Montaner as a weekly columnist. In 1992, the Liberal International named Montaner a vice president. These activities brought him into contact with many of the world's leaders. During the first half of the 1990s, the magazines Ciencia Pol√≠tica of Bogot√° and Perfiles Liberales of Mexico City invited him to join their editorial boards, and Newsweek and The Wall Street Journal sporadically began to publish his columns. Montaner produced three books during this period: C√≥mo y por qu√© cay√≥ el comuunismo; Libertad, la clave de la prosperidad; and Cuba hoy: la lenta muerte del castrismo. He was also named a visiting professor in universities in Guatemala, Ecuador, and Per√∫. The best-selling Manual del Perfecto Idiota Latinoamericano, in which he collaborated with √Ålvaro Vargas Llosa and Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza, was published in 1996 and in English in 2000 by Madison Books. Its highly popular sequel, Fabricantes de miseria, was published in 1998. Montaner also authored No perdamos tambi√©n el siglo XXI (1997) and, in 1999, Viaje al coraz√≥n de Cuba. In 1999, in Madrid, Montaner received the Premio de Periodismo de la Fundaci√≥n Independiente and the Medalla de la Cultura de Puerto Rico. In the same year he was the recipient of a Premio Am√©rica award by the de Centro Interamericano Gerencia Pol√≠tica with the inscription, \\"His writings on freedom have served as a guide to the oppressed and to the emerging democracies.\\" =2000s= In 2004 he was invited by The Miami Herald to be part of its Editorial Board. Since then his weekly columns are published in English. Other books were Las ra√≠ces torcidas de Am√©rica Latina (2002), Am√©rica Latina y la cultura occidental (2004) and La libertad y sus enemigos (2005), all dealing with the roots of Latin America poverty and underdevelopment. In 2006 Brickell Communicatios Group produced a series of 13 lessons on Cuban history for TV written and narrated by Montaner and also published a book with the scripts - Los Cubanos: historia de Cuba en una lecci√≥n. In 2007 two more books were published, Las columnas de la libertad and El regreso del idiota, the latter written with Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza and √Ålvaro Vargas Llosa. In March and April 2010, Montaner and Cuban singer Silvio Rodr√≠guez had a \\"compelling exchange of letters on Cuba\\". Montaner has an honorary doctoral degree from the Universidad Francisco Marroqu√≠n. His daughter Gina Montaner, was married to journalist Jorge Ramos; they had one daughter, Paola (born 1998).Univision Viday y Familia: \\"Rumores de boda de Jorge Ramos y Chiquinquir√°\\" July 30, 2012  See also  *Ana Navarro *Anderson Cooper *Andr√©s Oppenheimer *Arianna Huffington *Carlos Montero *Christiane Amanpour *Fareed Zakaria *Fernando del Rinc√≥n *Geovanny Vicente *Patricia Janiot *Pedro Bordaberry *Sylvia Garcia *CNN en Espa√±ol References External links *Carlos Montaner's Official Site *Audiovisual Media, NewMedia Universidad Francisco Marroqu√≠n *Honorary Doctoral Degrees, Universidad Francisco Marroqu√≠n *Carlos Alberto Montaner Freedom Collection interview Category:1943 births Category:Living people Category:People from Havana Category:Spanish journalists Category:Cuban journalists Category:Male journalists Category:Cuban emigrants to Spain Category:Exiles of the Cuban Revolution in Spain Category:Escapees from Cuban detention Category:Cuban escapees Category:Exiles of the Cuban Revolution in the United States ","title":"Carlos Alberto Montaner"},{"id":"10536010","text":"Fresnes-sur-Marne is a commune in the Seine-et-Marne department in the √éle-de- France region in north-central France.

Oxford University Press, Oxford. 1989 *Normans in Thomond defeated by Conor O‚ÄôBrien and his son, Tadhg. A brave battle was fought by Godfrey O'Donnell, Lord of Tirconnell, in defence of his country, with the Lord Justice of Ireland, Maurice Fitzgerald, and the other English nobles of Connacht, at Creadran-Cille in Ros-cede, in the territory of Carbury, to the north of Sligo. A desperate and furious battle was fought between them: bodies were mangled, heroes were disabled, and the senses were stunned on both sides. The field was vigorously maintained by the Kinel-Connell, who made such obstinate and vigorous onsets upon the English that, in the end, they routed them with great slaughter. Godfrey himself, however, was severely wounded; for he met Maurice Fitzgerald face to face in single combat, in which they wounded each other severely. In consequence of the success of this battle, the English and the Geraldines were driven out of Lower Connacht. On the same day Mac Griffin, an illustrious knight, was taken prisoner by O'Donnell's people; and Sligo was afterwards burned and totally plundered by them. Donough, the son of Cormac O'Donnell, was killed in the heat of this battle of Creadran. They (O'Donnell's people) then returned home in consequence of O'Donnell's wounds; but, were it not that his wounds had oppressed him, he would have routed his enemies to the River Moy. Godfrey, on his return, prostrated and demolished the castle which had been erected by the English a short time before, at Cael-uisce, to carry on the war against the Kinel-Connell.

He was one of the most important artists of Editorial Bruguera. His family were friends with comedians Wenceslao Fern√°ndez Fl√≥rez and Enrique Jardiel Poncela, who influenced V√°zquez's humor. V√°zquez started to publish in the 1940s in a new magazine. He started to publish in Editorial Bruguera in 1947. He created a lot of characters, for example: Las hermanas Gilda (The Gilda Sisters) (The adventures of two very different sisters), Anacleto, agente secreto (Anacleto, Secret Agent) (A surrealist parody of James Bond), La familia Cebolleta (The Scallion Family) or El t√≠o V√°zquez (Uncle V√°zquez) (A self- parody) When Editorial Bruguera disappeared he also joined in adult magazines such as El Papus or Makoki with the alias Sappo. V√°zquez died in 1995. There is a 2010 biopic film based on his life called El gran V√°zquez directed by √ìscar Aibar and starring Santiago Segura.

The western part of the mountain is located on the territory of the commune of Bugarach. Its eastern part is on the territory of Camps- sur-l'Agly. The geology of the Pic de Bugarach is striking. Its top layer is an overthrust from the Iberian plate and is older than the bottom ones. This has given rise to its description as an \\"upside-down mountain\\". It is possible to climb up the Bugarach: a classical route called \\"Voie de la fen√™tre\\" because of a big hole in a cliff, climbs the South face. One may go down via the easiest route, North, and join the \\"Col de Linas\\". Climbing still requires a good physical condition, and the mountain has claimed the life of at least one unprepared tourist. Esoterics Due to the mountain's unusual geology, a number of New Agers (called \\"esoterics\\" by local residents) believed that the mountain contained aliens living in a spacecraft. This group also believed that the upcoming end to the Mesoamerican Long Count calendar would result in some form of apocalypse. They believed that on 21 December 2012, the aliens supposedly living in the mountain would emerge to save them. As a result, some members of the group had taken to living on or near the mountain, and The Independent reported that up to 100,000 people might have been planning a trip prior to the believed apocalypse date. The mayor of the nearest town, Bugarach, said that over 20,000 visitors had arrived between January and July 2011, a significant increase over previous years. He also reported that a number of groups have been taking part in what he called strange rituals. A French parliamentary committee expressed concerns that the esoterics may be planning a mass suicide or other significant events. French police then blocked access to the mountain.ref>  References  Category:Landforms of Aude Category:Apocalypticism Category:Mountains of Occitanie ","title":"Pic de Bugarach"},{"id":"10536415","text":"Events from the year 1261 in Ireland.

Starring Robin Williams, Mandy Moore, John Krasinski, Christine Taylor, Eric Christian Olsen, and Josh Flitter, the film tells the story of a reverend who puts an engaged couple through a grueling marriage preparation course to see if they are meant to be married in his church. The film was released in theaters in the United States on July 3, 2007 by Warner Bros. Pictures, and was a box office hit, grossing $70.2 million against a $35 million budget. Plot Sadie Jones (Mandy Moore) has always longed to marry the man of her dreams in her family church. Though she has found her lifetime companion in Ben Murphy (John Krasinski), Sadie is distressed to learn that St. Augustine's has only one wedding slot available over the next two years, though after re- checking their planning book, they find that the wedding can be held in three weeks. While Sadie and Ben do qualify for the slot, the church's eccentric minister, Reverend Frank (Robin Williams), will not wed the couple until they agree to attend his prenuptial course (shortened, due to the new date, from three months to three weeks). As their wedding date draws near, Sadie and Ben must now follow all of Reverend Frank's rules, attend his unusual classes, and complete a series of homework assignments designed specifically to irritate one another ‚Äî in order to get past puppy love and ensure that their union will have a sound foundation. In one part of the course, the couple has to care for twin \\"creepy robot\\" babies. They get on Ben's last nerve and he destroys one, to the horror of bystanders in a department store. To Ben's dismay, one of Frank's rules is no pre-marital sex. On behalf of Frank, his young assistant (Josh Flitter) breaks into the couple's house and bugs it. Thus, Frank and his assistant can listen to all conversations, though Frank does not let his assistant listen to the adult parts. Ben discovers the microphone/transmitter but does not tell Sadie, for fear she will accuse him of lying and planting the bug himself. Problems gradually begin to develop between the couple due to the course. Ben begins an investigation into Frank, and eventually discovers that he was once married to a Maria Gonzalez. Shortly before the wedding, Sadie becomes reluctant to have the wedding, among other things because Ben has not prepared marriage vows as Frank instructed them to do, but instead drew a flip cartoon of a truck. Ben then confronts Frank over Maria Gonzalez, believing him to be a hypocrite. Frank reveals that the marriage was done to allow Maria, then an immigrant, and a member of Frank's congregation, to stay in the U.S. Upset that Ben would waste his time on a \\"stupid investigation\\", Sadie calls off the wedding. On Frank's advice, Sadie goes on vacation to Jamaica, their slated honeymoon destination. Ben seeks advice from his friend Joel, who advises him to give up on Sadie, saying that there are other women like her out there. Ben, however, disagrees with this, and decides to go to Jamaica. Frank and his assistant travel there too. He attempts to call Sadie, but she refuses to listen. Her parents assure her that all marriages have problems, and her friend Carlisle tells her that Ben may just want someone who relies on him, allowing her to forgive Ben more easily. Ben writes his vows on the sands of the beach to impress Sadie, they reconcile, and Frank marries them there.

Release =Critical reception= The film received negative reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 7% rating based on 124 reviews, with an average rating of 3.12/10. The consensus reads, \\"Featuring one of Robin Williams' most shtick-heavy performances, the broad and formulaic License to Wed wrings little out of its slightly creepy, unappealing premise.\\" Metacritic.com rated it 25 out of 100, based on 30 reviews, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". It was reviewed in Variety as \\"an astonishingly flat romantic comedy, filled with perplexing choices.\\" Numerous reviewers, including Brian Lowry of Variety and MaryAnn Johanson of Flick Filosopher described Williams' character as \\"creepy\\" and more worthy of a horror-film villain than a comic lead. =Box office= The film grossed $10,422,258 in its opening weekend opening at #4 at the U.S. Box Office behind Live Free or Die Hard, Ratatouille, and Transformers, which opened at the top spot. As of November 11, 2007, License to Wed had grossed $43.8 million domestically and $70.2 million worldwide, both career highs for Mandy Moore as a lead actress, and a box office success after a $35 million reported budget.

Crocker, architect of the U.S. policy of \\"constructive engagement\\" towards Southern Africa including apartheid-era South Africa, is credited with setting the terms of Namibian independence. Background Crocker was born in New York City in 1941. He attended Ohio State University and graduated with distinction in History in 1963. He obtained a master's degree at Johns Hopkins University in 1965, followed by a Ph.D at the School of Advanced International Studies. From 1969-1970, Crocker was a lecturer in African government and politics at the American University in Washington DC. He was recruited to join the National Security Council by Henry Kissinger in 1970, but returned to academia in 1972 as director of the Master of Science in Foreign Service program at Georgetown University, where he lectured in African politics and international relations. Over the course of the next nine years, Crocker advanced to assistant professor, and finally became associate professor at Georgetown University. Constructive engagement As chairman of Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential election campaign's \\"Africa working group\\", Crocker sought to change US policy on apartheid South Africa away from what he saw as the confrontational approach adopted by the Carter presidency and towards a new policy which he termed \\"constructive engagement.\\" Shortly after the election, Crocker attracted the attention of the Reagan transition team with an article he wrote in the winter 1980/81 edition of the Foreign Affairs journal. In the article, Crocker was highly critical of the outgoing Carter administration for its apparent hostility to the white minority government in South Africa, by acquiescing in the United Nations Security Council's imposition of a mandatory arms embargo (UNSCR 418/77) and the UN's demand for the end of South Africa's illegal occupation of Namibia (UNSCR 435/78). Crocker's policy linked the removal of South African forces from Namibia with the removal of Cuban forces from Angola, which many U.S. diplomats considered to be of vital importance. Without Cuban withdrawal, it was deemed unlikely by diplomats that South Africa would see an incentive to begin the removal of its own troops from Namibia. It was hoped that Cuba would view the withdrawal of its troops as a successful conclusion to their efforts in Africa as it would confirm Cuba's role as a significant player on the diplomatic stage. On February 7, 1981, Crocker formally proposed that the United States should link Namibian independence to the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, where they had formed a 700 km defensive line to prevent South African assaults similar to the 'Zulu' invasion of 1975. In April 1981, Assistant Secretary of State Crocker was dispatched to Africa on a two-week, eleven-nation tour to lay the groundwork for the new policy. However, Crocker was met with distrust on one side - the black leaders wary of the Reagan administration's friendly approach towards the white-minority government in South Africa - and hostility from the other, with prime minister P. W. Botha refusing to meet with him. Undeterred, Crocker continued to insist that a comprehensive solution was the only way to allay the fears on both sides. In his testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on February 15, 1983 he argued: > Security, of which the Cuban troop issue is an integral part, has always > been a prerequisite for agreement on Namibian independence. As a practical > diplomatic matter, it will not be possible to obtain a Namibian independence > agreement without satisfactory regional security assurances. Resolution 435 already required South Africa to leave Namibia so the incorporation of Cuba and Angola was deemed unnecessary in the eyes of some. The policy's requirement to cooperate with the South African government was viewed unfavorably by politicians and human rights organizations on account of the implicit condoning of apartheid. Author/journalist Christopher Hitchens gives credit for the independence agreement to the South-West Africa People's Organization, rather than to constructive engagement. However, UN diplomat Martti Ahtisaari contended that \\"South Africa had not the least intention of relinquishing Namibia.\\" Crocker's analysis of the situation from the perspective of the South African government concluded that this delay would never be overcome unless the South Africans felt that the execution of resolution 435 offered them an incentive. In spite of such criticisms and the initial distrust among black African leaders, Crocker persevered in his pursuit of a negotiated settlement for the related conflicts in Angola and Namibia. With help from skilled subordinates such as Frank G. Wisner and Vernon Walters, he managed to gain the trust of Kenneth Kaunda, the Zambian president. Kaunda visited the White House for talks with Ronald Reagan in March 1983, and agreed to host an international conference in February 1984 which resulted in the Lusaka Accords, a small but significant step forward in the search for peace in southern Africa.Andy DeRoche, Kenneth Kaunda, the United States and Southern Africa (London: Bloomsbury, 2016), 186-196. Relaxing the arms embargo On April 3, 1984 Richard Knight of the American Committee on Africa reported to the United Nations Special Committee against Apartheid on the effects the new policy was having: > The Reagan administration's policy of constructive engagement has already > led to a significant relaxation of the arms embargo. Stressing the goal of > regional stability, the American government has now adopted a policy which > they see as an 'even-handed' approach to all countries in the region. Thus > the Reagan administration seeks to blame all sides equally for the violence > in the region, ignoring the fact that the violence stems from apartheid. In > reality there is no even-handedness in the US's engagement in southern > Africa: a policy which in the last three years has resulted in an increased > South African ability to harass and dominate regionally. A study of the > easing of the arms embargo reveals that more than $28.3 million worth of > military equipment was authorised for sale to South Africa for fiscal years > 1981-1984, as compared to $25,000 for 1979.Reagan administration's policy of > \\"constructive engagement\\" and the arms embargo against South Africa While the FNLA and UNITA were funded by South Africa and the U.S., the Soviet Union had provided billions of dollars in military support for the MPLA, which was identified as a socialist group. By the end of the 1970s, Angola had become the focus of the USSR's African policy. Namibian independence Crocker intensified his mediation efforts in successive years. In May 1988 he headed a U.S. mediation team which brought negotiators from Angola, Cuba and South Africa, and observers from the Soviet Union together in London. Intense diplomatic maneuvering characterized the next seven months so as to implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 435 and secure Namibian independence. At the Reagan/Gorbachev summit in Moscow (May 29-June 1, 1988) it was decided that Cuban troops would be withdrawn from Angola, and Soviet military aid would cease, as soon as South Africa withdrew from Namibia. The Tripartite Accord, which gave effect to these decisions, were signed at UN headquarters in New York on December 22, 1988.Agreement Among the People's Republic of Angola, the Republic of Cuba, and the Republic of South Africa Crocker attended the signing ceremony along with George Shultz. UNSR Martti Ahtisaari took over from Crocker in April 1989 and began the implementation of UNSCR 435. In May 1989 Crocker stepped down as Assistant Secretary of State and returned to academia at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service. Elections were held from the 7‚Äì11 November 1989 and Namibia finally achieved independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990.United Nations report on Namibia's independence Chas. W. Freeman Jr commented at the time that \\"the emergence of Namibia as a stable, decent society with a well-managed economy would inspire more rapid change away from apartheid in South Africa.\\" He later commented in a 1995 interview with Charles Stuart Kennedy for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training that \\"there is no doubt that the South African opening to the outside world, which Crocker's diplomacy ultimately brokered and which produced the Cuban troop withdrawal from Angola and the Namibian independence in 1989, was a fundamental factor in impelling P. W. Botha's successor, F. W. De Klerk, in the direction of releasing Mandela and opening the political process to black South African participation.\\" Martti Ahtisaari was also of the opinion that the policy of constructive engagement acted as an undeniable catalyst for resolution. He remarked that \\"those of us close to the matter were aware that if nothing new was put forward we would remain in this situation for the rest of our lives. But we couldn't declare publicly that this was an excellent idea ‚Äì although in the final analysis it was a bold and adroit move by Crocker.\\"  Notable positions held  From 1969-70 Crocker was Professional Lecturer in African Government and Politics at the American University, before he left to join the National Security Council staff. He returned to academia in 1972, as Director of the Master of Science in Foreign Service Program at Georgetown University, a position he held until 1978. He held several other professorial roles, including director of African Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (1976‚Äì80) and James R. Schlesinger Professor in the Practice of Strategic Studies at Georgetown University (1999‚Äìpresent). Other notable positions held include service at the United States Institute of Peace, which supports research, education and training, as well as operating programs in conflict zones. He held the position of Chairman of the Board from 1992 to 2004, after which Crocker continued on as a Board Member until 2011. He is also a member of the Global Leadership Foundation, an independent, non-profit organisation which lends the expertise of established diplomats and world leaders to current governments. From May 2014 Crocker acted as a distinguished fellow with CIGI's Global Security & Politics Program, leading a project that examines Africa's regional conflict management strategy. In addition to these, Crocker sits on the Board of Directors for the International Peace and Security Institute, which offers intensive education and training to young professionals from world leaders in an effort to promote peaceful diplomacy.  Awards  In 1989, Ronald Reagan awarded Crocker with the Presidential Citizen's Medal. In 1992, Crocker was awarded an honorary doctorate from Rhodes University. On September 18, 2008, Crocker was appointed to the World Bank's new Independent Advisory Board, (IAB), which will provide advice on anti-corruption measures.Appointments to World Bank Anti-Corruption Board List of Affiliations *G3 Good Governance Group - Group Executive Chairman G3 Chester A.

It was formerly a public limited company (PLC) listed on the London Stock Exchange, until it was purchased by the French retailer Fnac in July 2016. History In 1957, the Darty family ‚Äì the father and his three sons, Natan, Marcel and Bernard ‚Äì managed a small store of textiles. The Darty brothers started to sell stock, and, to attract customers, they left the goods on the pavement. In a few days, the stock was sold. In 1967, the Darty brothers transferred to a larger warehouse. In 1988, the company proceeded with the repurchase of the company by its employees through a management buyout thus showing economic and social innovation. The operation was a success, since 90% of employees took part and controlled 56% of the capital. At the end of 1988, Darty opened its hundredth store. In 1993, Darty was bought by Kingfisher plc, which integrated Darty and Comet in a European entity based in Paris: Kingfisher Electricals S.A. ('Kesa'). In 1999, this led to Darty opening up a commercial internet site. This entity increased in size through acquisitions and, at the beginning of 2003, included Darty and But in France, Comet in the United Kingdom, BCC in the Netherlands, Vanden Borre in Belgium and Datart in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. In October 2006, Darty launched DartyBox, which is an ADSL internet, television and telecommunications provider based on the network of French internet operator Completel. The company was demerged from Kingfisher plc in July 2003. In July 2007, the company bought Menaje Del Hogar, an electrical retail chain based in Spain. On 6 July 2009, the company sold its Swiss operation. In February 2012, the company completed the sale of Comet Group, which they sold for ¬£2 to OpCapita in November 2011, and also paid the purchaser a \\"sweetener\\" of ¬£50 million to take the loss making venture away. On 31 July 2012, Kesa Electricals was renamed Darty plc. In March 2014, Darty launched its own marketplace (developed by Mirakl) that lists products and services from Darty and third party vendors. In November 2015, Darty plc reached an agreement to merge with the French retailer Fnac. In March 2016, Darty announced it had instead agreed to be purchased by Steinhoff International for ¬£673 million, through Steinhoff's Conforama subsidiary. Fnac returned with a higher offer, resulting in a bidding war between Fnac and Conforama during April 2016. The Fnac offer was declared unconditional on 19 July 2016, thereby allowing the takeover to be completed. In July 2019, Fnac Darty acquired Natures & Decouvertes, a specialist of outdoor, nature and well-being goods. Operations Darty was headquartered in London. It had sourcing offices based in Paris and Hong Kong, as well as a wholly owned wholesaler of electrical accessories, Dacem, which supplied all of Darty's European operations. Following the takeover by Fnac, Fnac and Darty merged, the Fnac group became Fnac Darty and the Darty headquarters joined the Fnac headquarters in Ivry Sur Seine.

Other terms for the field include wildlife damage management, wildlife control, and animal damage control to name a few. Some species of wildlife may become habituated to man's presence, causing property damage or risking transfer of disease to humans or pets (zoonosis). Many wildlife species coexist with humans very successfully, such as commensal rodents which have become more or less dependent on humans. Characteristics of nuisance species Deer-damaged tomato plant has been stripped of developing fruit Typically, species that are most likely to be considered a nuisance by humans have the following characteristics. First, they are adaptable to fragmented habitat. Animals such as Canada geese (Branta canadensis) love ponds with low sloping banks leading to lush green grass. Humans love this sort of landscaping too, so it is not surprising that Canada geese have thrived (not to mention the decline in hunting). Second, these animals are not tied to eating a specific type of food. For example, lynx do not thrive in human impacted environments because they rely so heavily on snowshoe hares. In contrast, raccoons have been very successful in urban landscapes because they can live in attics, chimneys, and even sewers, and can sustain themselves with food gained from trashcans and discarded litter. Third, successful animals must not pose an obvious significant risk to human health and safety. Animals perceived as grave threats will incur the extreme ire of humans and be under constant threat of humans seeking to eliminate them. Finally, successful animals in humanized landscapes are often perceived as \\"cute\\", at least until they become so numerous that their preferential status becomes diminished. Many wildlife species have the potential of becoming a \\"nuisance\\" species, and whether or not a species is regarded as a pest can be directly correlated with the degree to which that animal can be tolerated by humans. For many people, tree squirrels feeding in their yards or gardens are not a problem; a neighbor may feel that these same squirrels nesting in the attic of their house are a nuisance and a fire hazard, due to their habit of gnawing on electrical cables. Common nuisance species  Puerto Rican Boa came through toilet Common wildlife pests include armadillos, skunks, boars, foxes, squirrels, snakes, rats, groundhogs, beavers, opossums, raccoons, bats, moles, deer, mice, coyotes, bears, ravens, seagulls, woodpeckers and pigeons. Some of these species are protected by state or federal regulations, such as bears, ravens, bats, deer, woodpeckers, and coyotes, and a permit may be required to control some species. Wildlife are usually only pests in certain situations, such as when their numbers become \\"excessive\\" in a particular area. Human-induced changes in the environment will often result in increased numbers of a species. For example, piles of scrap building material make excellent sites where rodents can nest. Food left out for household pets is often equally attractive to some wildlife species. In these situations, the wildlife have suitable food and habitat and may become a nuisance. Controlling wildlife damage Raccoon on a roof. The primary objective of any control program should be to reduce damage in a practical, humane and environmentally acceptable manner. Wildlife managers and wildlife control operators (WCOs) use control methods based on the habits and biology of the animals causing damage. By using methods matched to the nuisance species, control efforts will be more effective and will serve to maximize safety to the environment, humans and other animals. A key to controlling wildlife damage is prompt and accurate determination of which animal is causing the damage. Even someone with no training or experience can sometimes identify the pest by thoroughly examining the damaged area. Because feeding indications of many wildlife species are similar, other signs ‚Äì such as droppings, tracks, burrows, nests or food caches ‚Äì are usually needed to make a positive species identification. After the wildlife pest is identified, control methods can be chosen appropriate to the animal species involved. Improper control methods may harm but not kill the animal, causing it to become leery of those and other methods in the future. For example, using traps and poison baits improperly or in the wrong situation may teach the animal that the control method is harmful. This may make the animal difficult to control later, even with the correct method. :Four steps lead to a successful nuisance wildlife control program: *Correctly identify the species causing the problem. *Alter the habitat, if possible, to make the area less attractive to the wildlife pest. *Use a control method appropriate to the location, time of year, and other environmental conditions. *Monitor the site for re-infestation in order to determine if additional control is necessary. Control methods The most commonly used methods for controlling nuisance wildlife around homes and gardens include exclusion, habitat modification, repellents, toxic baits, glue boards, traps and frightening. Wildlife control involves human risks both from possible injury to person and property, but also from zoonotic disease. =Exclusion= Physically excluding an offending animal from the area being damaged or disturbed is often the best and most permanent way to control the problem. Depending upon size of the area to be protected, this control method can range from inexpensive to prohibitively costly. For example, damage by birds or rabbits to ornamental shrubs or garden plants can be reduced inexpensively by placing bird netting over the plants to keep the pests away. On the other hand, fencing out deer from a lawn or garden can be more costly. Materials needed for exclusion will depend upon the species causing the problem. Large mammals can be excluded with woven wire fences, poly-tape fences, and electric fences; but many communities forbid the use of electric fencing in their jurisdictions. Small mammals and some birds can be excluded with netting, tarp, hardware cloth or any other suitable material; nets come in different weave sizes suitable for different animals to be excluded. However, exclusion can interfere with the natural movement of wildlife, particularly when exclusion covers large areas of land. =Habitat modification= Modifying an animal‚Äôs habitat often provides lasting and cost- effective relief from damage caused by nuisance wildlife. Habitat modification is effective because it limits access to one or more of the requirements for life ‚Äì food, water or shelter. However, habitat modification, while limiting nuisance wildlife, may also limit desirable species such as songbirds as well. Rodent- or bat-proofing buildings by sealing cracks and holes prevents these animals from gaining access to suitable habitats where they are not welcome. Storing seed and pet food in tightly closed containers, controlling weeds and garden debris around homes and buildings, and storing firewood and building supplies on racks or pallets above ground level are also practices that can limit or remove the animals‚Äô sources of food, water or shelter. =Repellents= Using a repellent that changes the behavior of an animal may lead to a reduction or elimination of damage. Several available repellents, such as objectionable-tasting coatings or odor repellents, may deter wildlife from feeding on plants. Other repellents such as sticky, tacky substances placed on or near windows, trees or buildings may deter many birds and small mammals. Unfortunately, most wildlife soon discover that repellents are not actually harmful, and the animals may quickly become accustomed to the smell, taste or feel of these deterrents. Chemical repellents applied outdoors will have to be reapplied due to rain or heavy dew, or applied often to new plant growth to be effective. Failure to carefully follow the directions included with repellents can drastically diminish the effectiveness of the product. Some repellents contain toxic chemicals, such as paradichlorobenzene, and are ineffective unless used at hazardous concentrations. Other more natural repellents contain chili pepper or capsaicin extracted from hot peppers. However, even under the best of conditions, repellents frequently fail to live up to user expectations. The reason for this is twofold. First, many repellents simply don't work. For example, peer-reviewed publications have consistently shown that ultrasonic devices do not drive unwanted animals away. Second, even when the repellent has been shown to work, animals in dire need of food will \\"hold their nose\\" and eat anyway because the alternative is essentially death by starvation. Repellents are most successful (referring to products actually demonstrated by peer-reviewed research to be effective) when animals have access to alternative food sources in a different location. =Glue traps and boards= Glue traps and boards can be either a lethal or non-lethal method of control. Glue boards can be used to trap small mammals and snakes. Applying vegetable oil will dissolve the glue, allowing for release, but caution must be taken to avoid scratches and bites from the trapped animal. =Live trapping= Using traps can be very effective in reducing actual population numbers of certain species. However, many species cannot be trapped without a permit. In most cases, homeowners may trap an offending animal within 100 yards of their residence without a permit, however relocation is often illegal. Traditional live traps such as cage or box traps are easily purchased at most garden centers or hardware stores. These traps allow for safe release of the trapped animal. The release of the animal to another area may be prohibited by state law, or may be regulated by the local Department of Fish and Game. Leghold traps may allow for either release or euthanasia of the trapped animal. Traps such as body-gripping traps, scissor and harpoon traps, as well as rat/mouse snap traps, are nearly always lethal. Knowledge of animal behavior, trapping techniques, and baits is essential for a successful trapping program.(Bornheimer, Shane P. \\"PreferredWildlifeservices.com\\" July 2013) =Frightening devices= Frightening devices such as bells, whistles, horns, clappers, sonic emitters, audio tapes and other sound devices may be quite successful in the short term for repelling an animal from an area. Other objects such as effigies, lights, reflectors and windmills rely on visual stimulation to scare a problem animal away. Often nuisance animals become accustomed to these tactics, and will return later if exposed to these devices daily. =Sonic nets= In 2013, Dr. John Swaddle and Dr. Mark Hinders at the College of William and Mary created a new method of deterring birds and other animals using benign sounds projected by conventional and directional (parametric) speakers. The initial objectives of the technology were to displace problematic birds from airfields to reduce bird strike risks, minimize agricultural losses due to pest bird foraging, displace nuisance birds that cause extensive repair and chronic clean-up costs, and reduce bird mortality from flying into man-made structures. The sounds, referred to as a ‚ÄúSonic Net,‚Äù do not have to be loud and are a combination of wave forms - collectively called \\"colored\\" noise - forming non- constructive and constructive interference with how birds and other animals such as deer talk to each other. Technically, the Sonic Nets technology is not a bird or wildlife scarer, but discourages birds and animals from going into or spending time in the target area. The impact to the animals is similar to talking in a crowded room, and since they cannot understand each other they go somewhere else. Early tests at an aviary and initial field trials at a landfill and airfield indicate that the technology is effective and that birds do not habituate to the sound. The provisional and full patents were filed in 2013 and 2014 respectively, and further research and commercialization of the technology are ongoing. Laws Before initiating any wildlife control activities, a person must become familiar with applicable federal, state, and local laws. One way to learn these rules is to contact the state's wildlife agency, which is usually responsible for selling hunting and fishing licenses. In general, property owners are permitted to prevent wildlife damage through exclusion and habitat modification, though they may be prohibited from disturbing an occupied nest or den, or directly harming an animal. Many regulations exist in the United States concerning animal trapping including trap check intervals, usually requiring all traps be checked at least once during a 24-hour period. Some governments permit relocation of wildlife, however humane considerations must be taken into account before relocating wildlife, including population and habitat. Ethics There are many ethical considerations in nuisance wildlife management. Some species of wildlife cannot be ethically relocated due to overabundance of competing species, or lack of availability of proper food and habitat. Control during the spring months does run the risk of killing the young by starvation. Proper euthanasia of animals when necessary is also a controversial and sensitive consideration to be taken prior to engaging in nuisance wildlife management, and requires training and certification in some areas of the United States.

A Leveller, he was the only soldier executed for his involvement in the Bishopsgate mutiny. Lockyer has been identified with the son of Mary Lockyer, a resident of St. Botulph Bishopsgate who, with her son, was known to have been a Strict Baptist by 1642. In the same year, Lockyer certainly joined the Parliamentary Army. He served in the regiment of Edward Whalley during the turmoil at the end of the decade; by this time he was already deeply committed to Leveller ideas. When some of the troops under Captain John Savage were removed to Essex (apparently in order to remove them from Leveller agitation in central London), Lockyer helped incite a brief mutiny. On 24 April 1649, he and some other soldiers took the regimental colors and barricaded themselves inside a Leveller meeting-place in Bishopsgate. The soldiers' complaints were more practical than ideological: they refused to leave unless paid overdue wages. The arrival of Thomas Fairfax and Cromwell on the scene put an end to the brief insurrection. Fairfax singled out Lockyer for punishment, as the presumed ringleader. On 27 April he was executed by firing squad in the yard of St Paul's Cathedral. His funeral procession was reportedly attended by more than four thousand people, many wearing green ribbons to signal their allegiance to Leveller ideas. The affair crystallized popular discontent with Cromwell's martial law, and Lockyer's memory was invoked by the mutineers at Banbury later the same year. References Further reading * Ian J.

The issuance of the aforementioned privateer commission to Morgan, who used it to attack and plunder the Spanish possession of Panama, resulted in revocation of Modyford's governorship and arrest in 1671. King Charles II of England, in desperate need of Spain as an ally in an impending war with the Dutch, had ordered the arrest and revocation merely to appease a Spanish Crown, furious over the destruction of their prize city.

Her work is influenced by her experiences of life in Colombia, and is generally composed of commonplace items such as wooden furniture, clothing, concrete, grass, and rose petals.Biography on Tate Collection website. URL accessed on 8 April 2007. Salcedo's work gives form to pain, trauma, and loss, while creating space for individual and collective mourning. These themes stem from her own personal history. Members of her own family were among the many people who have disappeared in politically troubled Colombia. Much of her work deals with the fact that, while the death of a loved one can be mourned, their disappearance leaves an unbearable emptiness. Salcedo lives and works in Bogot√°, Colombia. Early life and education Doris Salcedo was born in 1958 in Bogot√°, Colombia. Salcedo completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts at Jorge Tadeo Lozano University in 1980, before traveling to New York City, where she completed a Master of Fine Arts degree at New York University in 1984. She then returned to Bogot√° to teach at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia. Art as repair Doris Salcedo addresses the question of forgetting and memory in her installation artwork. In pieces such as Unland: The Orphan‚Äôs Tunic from 1997 and the La Casa Viuda series from the early 1990s, Salcedo takes ordinary household items, such as a chair and table, and transforms them into memorials for victims of the Civil War in Colombia.Bal, Mieke. Of What One Cannot Speak: Doris Salcedo's Political Art, University of Chicago Press, 2011 In his book Present Pasts: Present Pasts: Urban Palimpsests and the Politics of Memory, Andreas Huyssen dedicates a chapter to Doris Salcedo and Unland: The Orphan‚Äôs Tunic, presenting her work as ‚ÄúMemory Sculpture.‚Äù Huyssen offers a detailed description of the piece, a seemingly mundane table that, when considered closely, ‚Äúcaptures the viewer‚Äôs imagination in its unexpected, haunting visual and material presence.‚ÄùAndreas Huyssen, Present Pasts: Urban Palimpsest and the Politics of Memory (Stanford, CA: Stanford, 2003), 113 A seemingly everyday piece of furniture is in fact made of two destroyed tables joined together and covered with a whitish veil of fabric, presumably the orphan's original tunic. Upon even closer inspection, hundreds of small human hairs appear to be the thread that is attaching the tunic to the table. Huyssen equates the structure of the tables to the body. ‚ÄúIf the tunic is like a skin‚Ä¶then the table gains a metaphoric presence as body, not now of an individual orphan but an orphaned community.‚Äù Salcedo's Unland is a memory sculpture, presenting the past of her own country of Colombia to the international art audience. During a conversation with Carlos Basualdo, Salcedo discusses her own approach to producing art: > ‚ÄúThe way that an artwork brings materials together is incredibly powerful. > Sculpture is its materiality. I work with materials that are already charged > with significance, with meaning they have required in the practice of > everyday life‚Ä¶then, I work to the point where it becomes something else, > where metamorphosis is reached.‚ÄùInterview with Carlos Basualdo in Doris > Salcedo, Edited by Nancy Princenthal, Carlos Basualdo and Andreas Huyssen > (London: Phaidon, 2000), 21 Again, in a 1998 interview with Charles Merewether, Salcedo expounds upon this notion of the metamorphosis, describing the experience of the viewer with her own artistic repair or restoration of the past. > ‚ÄúThe silent contemplation of each viewer permits the life seen in the work > to reappear. Change takes place, as if the experience of the victim were > reaching out‚Ä¶The sculpture presents the experience as something present- a > reality that resounds within the silence of each human being that gazes upon > it.‚ÄùInterview with Charles Merewether in Doris Salcedo, 137 Salcedo employs objects from the past, objects imbued with an important sense of history and, through these contemporary memory sculptures, illustrates the flow of time. She joins the past and the present, repairs what she sees as incomplete and, in the eyes of Huyssen, presents ‚Äúmemory at the edge of an abyss‚Ä¶memory in the literal sense‚Ä¶and memory as process.‚Äù Installations Salcedo's work has become increasingly installation-based. She uses gallery spaces or unusual locations to create art and environments that are politically and historically charged. Noviembre 6 y 7 (2002) is a work commemorating the seventeenth anniversary of the violent seizing of the Supreme Court in Bogot√° on November 6 and 7, 1985. Salcedo placed this piece in the new Palace of Justice. It took her over the course of 53 hours (the duration of the original siege) to place wooden chairs against the fa√ßade of the building being lowered from different points on its roof. Salcedo did this as creating ‚Äúan act of memory‚Äù. Her goal was to re-inhabit the space that was forgotten. In 2003, in a work she called Installation for the 8th Istanbul Biennial, she did an installation in a commonplace street consisting of 1,500 wooden chairs stacked precariously in the space between two buildings. In 2005, at the Castello di Rivoli, Salcedo reworked one of the institution's major rooms by extending the existing vaulted brick ceiling of the gallery. Subtly transforming the existing space, Abyss was designed to evoke thoughts of incarceration and entombment. For 2007 Salcedo became the eighth artist to have been commissioned to produce work for the Unilever turbine hall of the Tate Modern gallery in London for which she created Shibboleth, a 167-metre- long crack running the length of the hall's floor (pictured above) that Salcedo says \\"represents borders, the experience of immigrants, the experience of segregation, the experience of racial hatred. It is the experience of a Third World person coming into the heart of Europe\\".Colombian Art In this way her installation represented exclusion, separation and otherness. Exhibitions Salcedo has exhibited in group exhibitions internationally including Carnegie International (1995), XXIV S√£o Paulo Biennial (1998), Trace, The Liverpool Biennial of Contemporary Art (1999), Documenta XI, Kassel (2002), 8th Istanbul Biennial (2003), ‚ÄòNeoHooDoo‚Äô, PS1 Contemporary Art Centre, New York, The Menil Collection, Houston (2008), ‚ÄòThe New D√©cor‚Äô, Hayward Gallery, London (2010), and the Allen Memorial Art Museum at Oberlin College (2014‚Äì15). Solo exhibitions include The New Museum of Contemporary Art, New York (1998), San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1999 and 2005), Tate Britain, London (1999), Camden Arts Centre, London (2001), White Cube, London (2004), Tate Modern, London (2007), The 80's: A Topology (2007), and Inhotim, Centro de Arte Contempor√¢nea, Belo Horizonte, (2008). From April 2010 through February 2013, the artist's installation ‚Äúplegaria Muda‚Äù traveled to museums throughout Europe and South America, including MUAC, Mexico; Moderna Museet, Malm√∂ and CAM Gulbenkian, Lisbon (2011); MAXXI Rome and Pinacoteca S√£o Paulo (2012), the Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago (2015), and the Solomon R.

Analysis of individual artworks Istanbul is an installation made up of 1,550 chairs stacked between two tall urban buildings. Salcedo's idea with this piece was to create what she called \\"a topography of war.\\" She clarifies this by saying it is meant to \\"represent war in general and not a specific historical event\\". Salcedo is quoted saying \\"seeing these 1,550 wooden chairs piled high between two buildings in central Istanbul, I‚Äôm reminded of mass graves. Of anonymous victims. I think of both chaos and absence, two effects of wartime violence.\\" Salcedo explains, ‚ÄúWhat I‚Äôm trying to get out of these pieces is that element that is common in all of us.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd in a situation of war, we all experience it in much the same way, either as victim or perpetrator. So I‚Äôm not narrating a particular story. I‚Äôm just addressing experiences.‚Äù In 2007, four years after Salcedo's installation in Istanbul, another artist, Chinese dissident Ai Weiwei, used chairs to create a memory effect in his piece Fairytale. He installed the set of 1001 Ming and Qing dynasty chairs at Documenta 12 in Kassel, Germany, one chair for each of the 1001 Chinese travelers displaced. His piece focused on Chinese displacement, a similar topic to Salcedo. Atrabiliarios is an installation that incorporates plywood, shoes, animal fiber, thread, and sheepskin all in six different niches. In her piece old shoes, in pairs and singles, are encased behind sheets of translucent animal skin inside alcoves or niches in the gallery wall. The skin is crudely stitched to the wall with medical sutures. On the floor underneath are some small boxes made from the same animal skin. The worn shoes all belonged to women who 'disappeared', and were donated to Salcedo by the victims' families. The use of these shoes in Atrabiliarios is meant to echoe the memory of those whose fate and whereabouts is unknown. Salcedo describes this a being \\"permanently suspended between the present and the past\\". Therefore, Atrabiliarios is \\"not only a portrait of disappearance, but a portrait of the survivors' mental condition of uncertainty, longing and mourning.\\" Salcedo is seeking not only to express the horror of violence but also to investigate the way people prevail in times of torture, repairing their physical and psychological wounds, as well as raising resistance and remembering those who are missing. Shibboleth was her Turbine Hall installation at Tate Modern in London. Salcedo was the first artist to change the physical building. Salcedo used this piece to give voice to the victims of all the injustices that have separated people and armed them against one another. Rather than fill Turbine Hall with an installation, she opened up a subterranean wound in the floor that stretched the entire length of the former power station. The concrete walls of the crevice were ruptured by a steel mesh fence, creating a tension between elements that resisted each other and at the same time depended on one another. The installation began as a thin, almost invisible line at the main entrance and gradually widened into a chasm at the far end. This design was meant to evoke the brokenness and separateness of post-colonial cultures especially in her homeland of Colombia. Shibboleth raised questions about the interaction of ideological foundations on which Western notions of modernity are built and questions about racism and colonialism that underlie the modern world. ‚ÄúThe history of racism,‚Äù Salcedo said, ‚Äúruns parallel to the history of modernity and is its untold dark side.‚Äù With Shibboleth, Salcedo focused attention on the existence of a large, socially excluded underclass present in all societies. Salcedo said that breaking open the floor of Turbine Hall symbolized the fracture in modernity itself. This urged viewers to confront uncomfortable truths about history and people. The crack also represented the divide between rich and poor, which can start off relatively little but ultimately turn into a great divide that is capable of dismantling cultures. The crack was made whole at the conclusion of the show, yet there is a sliver that will always be there in the flooring. Flor de Piel is a room-sized installation first publicly exhibited at the Harvard Art Museums in Salcedo's 2016-2017 solo exhibition, Doris Salcedo: The Materiality of Mourning. A Flor de Piel, measuring 340 cm x 500 cm, is a tapestry of thousands of preserved, hand-sewn red rose petals. The artist intended the work to be a shroud for a nurse who was tortured to death in the Colombian war. Salcedo created the piece in 2013, working with rose petals and thread as her materials; A Flor de Piel was acquired by the Harvard Art Museums in 2014. Plegaria Muda is a series of sculptures, each composed of two hand-crafted tables, which are approximately the same shape and size of a coffin. One table lays upside down on the other, with an earthlike layer with grass growing between the two table tops. \\"Plegaria Muda\\" translates roughly to \\"silent prayer\\", and is a comment on the relationships between the perpetrators of gang violence and their victims, as well as a homage to the mass grave sites In Colombia where victims of gang violence are often buried. Current research and themes Since 1988 Salcedo has interviewed people whose relatives have been \\"disappeared\\" by presumably order of the military associated with Colombia's civil war and illegal drug trade. She regularly visits abandoned villages, murder sites, and mass graves. Salcedo reports that she has been doing much of the same research for many years with only small variations. For many years she kept files on concentration camps, these included both historical and more contemporary camps. She is most interested in how they vary from one another because they are always there just presented in different forms. > \\"I was amazed when Guantanamo was opened in Cuba, because Cuba was the first > place that had a concentration camp. Actually it was a Spanish invention. A > Spanish general, Martinez Campos, thought it up in 1896. At that time they > implemented it in Cuba. It‚Äôs amazing to see how it has come full circle.

The wall was built in 1530s, and demolished in 1934. Throughout the 19th century, Staraya Square and northbound Novaya Square frequently interchanged their names, confusing Muscovites and visitors; modern usage settled down in early 20th century. In 1899, the city closed down the flea markets around the fortress wall.

It represents the monetary value of all products and services produced in the country within a defined period of time. \\"In comparing GVA and GDP, we can say that GVA is a better measure for the economic welfare of the population, because it includes all primary incomes. From the point of view of the society as a whole GDP, despite its disadvantages, is probably a better measure for economic growth and welfare, because it includes also NET INDIRECT TAX (indirect taxes minus subsidies) which are the financial basis for the collective consumption of the society.\\" The relationship between GVA and GDP is defined as: :GVA= GDP + Subsidies on products - Taxes on products As the total aggregates of taxes on products and subsidies on products are only available at whole economy level, Gross value added is used for measuring gross regional domestic product and other measures of the output of entities smaller than a whole economy. Restated, :GDP at factor cost = Gross value added(GVA) at factor cost :GDP at factor cost = value of the final goods and services produced within the domestic territory of a country during one year by all production units inclusive of depreciation. :GDP at market price = GDP at factor cost + net indirect taxes(indirect taxes- subsidies) :GVA at factor cost = value of output (quantity * price) - value of intermediary consumption.  GVA at different levels  GVA can be used for measuring of the contribution to GDP made by an individual producer, industry or sector. For instance, to analyze the productivity of the market sector one can use GVA per worker or GVA per hour. The measure preferred by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development‚Äôs (OECD) in the Productivity Database is GVA per hour. At the company level GVA refers to the net income of a produced particular good. \\"In other words, the gross value added number reveals and potentially creating a bottom-line profit. Once the consumption of fixed capital and the effects of depreciation are subtracted, the company knows how much net value a particular operation adds to its bottom line.\\" Disadvantages of GVA * Comparison over time is difficult. Advantages of GVA * Internationally comparable figure. * Better market condition projection globally, especially in case of FIIs.  Conclusion  Over-simplistically, GVA is the grand total of all revenues, from final sales and (net) subsidies, which are incomes into businesses. Those incomes are then used to cover expenses (wages & salaries, dividends), savings (profits, depreciation), and (indirect) taxes. GVA is sector specific, and GDP is calculated by summation of GVA of all sectors of economy with taxes added and subsidies are deducted.

It was published by Electronic Arts and was the final game developed by Pandemic Studios. The BlackBerry and iOS versions were developed and published by Hands-On Mobile. Plot The game is set in 1940, and its protagonist, Sean Devlin (based on William Grover-Williams) is a hard drinking Irish race car mechanic, and a regular among the racing groups of Paris. He arrives in Saarbr√ºcken with his mentor Vittore Morini, best friend Jules Rousseau, and Jules' sister Veronique. Sean is set to race in the Saarbr√ºcken Grand Prix, and quickly meets up with his on-again, off-again girlfriend Skylar St. Claire. He starts a rivalry with Kurt Dierker, an infamous racer and champion of the Nazis. During the race, Dierker cheats by shooting out one of Sean's tires. For revenge, Sean and Jules plan on breaking into Doppelsieg, the automotive factory that Dierker works for, to sabotage his car, despite Skylar warning them that Dierker is not what he seems. At the factory, Sean and Jules are captured and tortured by Dierker, who reveals himself to be a Nazi SS Commander and believes them to be British spies. Dierker tortures and murders Jules before Sean's eyes, before Sean manages to escape only to witness the German invasion of France. Sean manages to rescue Vittore and Veronique before they escape to Paris. Sean tells Jules' family what happened to him, and promises to take revenge on Dierker. Months later, Sean is living in La Belle Du Nuit, a cabaret owned by Jules' family. Sean is approached by Luc Gaudin, a local writer, love interest of Veronique, and leader of a resistance group against the Nazi occupation. Sean is talked into joining the resistance by Luc, and is tasked with disrupting Nazi operations by killing high-ranking officers, and destroying military installations. He also gets involved with other resistance leaders and members including Father Denis, a defrocked Catholic priest; Duval Mingo, whose lover betrayed him to a high ranking Nazi; and Margot Bonnaire, who seeks to preserve French culture that the Nazis aim to destroy. Through his work, Sean builds a reputation as a member of the resistance. The growth in resistance activity in Paris as a result of Sean's work does not go unnoticed by Nazi command, and soon, elite Nazi terror units are called in by the German administrative commander in Paris who is revealed to be Dierker. Sean meets up with Skylar again, who reveals herself to be a British spy with the Special Operations Executive (SOE), and she takes Sean to her superiors. They task him with a series of jobs, including stealing an unknown treasure from the Nazis. Sean and Skylar are soon tasked with rescuing a defecting German scientist named Dr. Kessler. It is revealed that the Doppelseig factory is a front for an atomic weapons project that they were forcing Kessler to create. After Kessler is rescued, he refuses to work with anyone unless his daughter Maria is saved as well. Sean soon rescues Maria from her captors and takes her to the resistance headquarters, which is immediately then attacked by the Nazis, forcing the resistance to flee into the catacombs. During this raid, Veronique is captured and prepped for execution at Notre Dame. Luc, not wanting to expend resistance resources to save one prisoner, denies Sean's request for an organized raid to rescue Veronique. After this, Sean is forced to rescue Veronique by himself, which he succeeds in doing. Luc comes up with a plan to topple the Nazi leadership, who are set to host a race, by having a driver blow them up with a rigged car. While Sean successfully wins the race, and wipes out most of the leadership, Dierker survives and takes control of the remaining Nazis. In retaliation, the Nazis destroy La Belle Du Nuit, killing Veronique's parents and Vittore. Sean races to the catacombs, where the resistance is being attacked by the Nazis. While Sean is successful in fighting them off, Luc is found to be half-buried under debris, forcing Veronique to kill him so he doesn't get taken alive when the next Nazi attack occurs. Furthermore, during the attack, the Nazis succeed in capturing Dr. Kessler and his daughter once again. Sean, Veronique, and Skylar team up to raid the Doppelseig factory and rescue the Kesslers. Once Dr. Kessler is rescued, he and Sean go on to dismantle the weapons and set the factory to explode as they escape. With the factory destroyed, and the Kesslers rescued, Sean and Veronique return to Paris where the people have risen up against the Nazi power. Veronique takes on the duty of becoming the new leader of the resistance. After sharing a passionate kiss with Veronique, Sean tracks down Dierker to the Eiffel Tower, where he is found to be executing his men for failing to subdue the civil uprising. Sean finally confronts Dierker at the top of the tower, where Sean can either shoot Dierker off the tower, or wait and witness Dierker jump off himself. With Dierker dead, Veronique asks Sean if it's all over, to which Sean replies he's \\"Just getting started.\\" Gameplay Sean Devlin standing on a street corner The player can explore Nazi-occupied Paris, some of the French countryside and parts of Germany. Color is a key element in the gameplay. Areas which are heavily controlled by the Nazis are represented in black and white, with the exception of the characters' irises, city lights, blood and blue symbols of the French Resistance, and various German symbols, which are bright red and complete with swastikas. In these areas, German soldiers are present in large numbers, making it far more likely that Sean will be detected in his rebellious activities. To \\"inspire\\" that district again, players must weaken the German forces occupying the area. In doing so, that district's citizens regain their hope, visually represented by the area becoming vibrant and full of color. Germans in these areas will not be completely evicted but Sean has a higher chance of escaping them since they will no longer be so ubiquitous, and will primarily be centered on military bases, barracks, checkpoints, HQs, and other strategically important sites. In addition, the French people will play an active role in the struggle for colored zones. For example, if Sean gets into a fight with German soldiers in a colored area, allies like the French Resistance, the Maquis, and even passing French civilians will intervene against the occupiers. Throughout the game, Sean can upgrade his abilities and arsenal via \\"Perks\\", such as improving accuracy with a sniper rifle, ammo count for all weapons, damage, and more. Perks are gained through actions, such as evading high-level alarms, sniping targets or demolishing a set number of German installations or vehicles with a certain requirement. The player also has the ability to scale buildings and run across rooftops, where sometimes British supply boxes can be found, or to reach a good sniper's view of the ground beneath. Garages are available to the player, which can save parked vehicles and repair damaged ones. The player can also engage in fist-fights or use a more stealthy approach, such as sneaking around or using a Nazi's uniform as a disguise. Should the player die while free- roaming, Sean will lose all of his weapons and grenades he had equipped prior to death. The player can buy weapons, ammunition, explosives, maps and other items from several black market merchants. Once Sean has purchased a weapon from the dealers, he can equip himself with that weapon at any time. =The Midnight Show= A code for a downloadable patch entitled \\"The Midnight Show\\" was free to those who purchased a new copy of the game for either the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3. For the Windows version, the extra content was already included on the disc. The content was later released on Xbox Live Marketplace and on the PlayStation Network (in the UK, the content is free of charge) for people who did not have the code. The extra content provides the player with extra brothels and hiding spots. It also includes a minigame in which the player can earn in-game items such as a car not found during the main campaign. Most notably, however, installing the add-on automatically renders all brothel girls in the game topless, although nudity can still be toggled on and off. This caused some controversy at the time of the game's release. Development The game has been called the developer's swan song, since Pandemic Studios was liquidated after its completion. Areas that were cut from the game late in development include a giant Nazi missile silo built into the side of a mountain, called Valhall; Pandemic concept artist Jason Hazelroth spent three years designing the project. In further concept art, Hazelroth revealed an experimental Nazi jet called the XJ-05, which functioned as a boss fight while it was still docked, and another smaller jet, the JX-07, which could have been used by the player. After the game was released, customers reported that the game was unplayable with an ATI graphics card. Some game retailers, including Direct2Drive, had placed a warning on their web sites declaring problems with the game's compatibility. A workaround required the user to disable multi-core processing entirely, which would significantly decrease their computer's performance. Pandemic employees acknowledged the issue and released a beta patch on December 18, 2009. The patch stated that users with quad core CPUs would possibly have severe streaming issues, which required restricting the game to a single core as a workaround. This was despite the game's recommended specifications listing a quad core CPU. Reception The PC version of The Saboteur received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", and the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions received \\"average\\" reviews, while the iOS version received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN praised the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions for their sound, black and white visuals, and \\"cheap thrills\\", while criticizing their unpolished gameplay and somewhat silly animation. GameTrailers called the Xbox 360 version yet another open- world destruction game of 2009. The game was praised for being fun, although the site criticized the choppy voice acting, varying graphical quality and the unpolished end product. X-Play praised the same console version's unique look and setting, and the variety of gameplay, but criticized its poorly executed story, enemy AI, and various glitches. The PlayStation 3 version was noted for its anti-aliasing technique on a console that has traditionally had difficulty with AA. Using one of the PS3's Synergistic Processing Units to perform after- image edge detection and blurring, under optimal conditions it manages equivalent to 16xAA. The game was frequently compared to Velvet Assassin, released the same year and featuring similar aesthetics and gameplay styles. The A.V. Club gave the PS3 version an A‚àí and said, \\"The nicest touch is that your free-roaming sabotage has a direct effect on the quests that advance the main story.\\" 411Mania gave the Xbox 360 version a score of 7.5 out of 10 and said, \\"If you‚Äôre a fan of GTA or Mercs 1 or 2 you‚Äôll probably get some enjoyment out of the Saboteur, but for everyone else this game is a rental at best.\\" The Daily Telegraph gave the same console version seven out of ten and called it \\"a highly enjoyable game in its own right and it succeeds at being pure, rollicking entertainment. Players who are prepared to look past its derivative gameplay will find its silly characters [and] ridiculous plot and even some of its technical flaws may just be part of the reason they continue playing it long after the first couple of hours have passed by.\\" Wired, however, gave the same console version six stars out of ten and called it \\"a big game best taken in small doses: An hour or two of clamber up the side of a building, snipe some guys, drive like hell, lather, rinse, repeat was plenty. Any more than that and I started to think maybe the Nazis could just have France, if they wanted it so bad.\\" Edge gave the PS3 version five out of ten and called it \\"an awesome display of clich√©s, stereotypes, shortcuts and failures in logic.\\" References External links  Category:2009 video games Category:Action-adventure games Category:Black-and-white media Category:BlackBerry games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:IOS games Category:Neo-noir video games Category:Open world video games Category:Pandemic Studios games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Rebellions in fiction Category:Single-player video games Category:Stealth video games Category:Third-person shooters Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set in 1940 Category:Video games set in France Category:Video games set in Germany Category:Video games set in Paris Category:Video games using Havok Category:Windows games Category:World War II video games Category:Video games about Nazi Germany Category:Xbox 360 games ","title":"The Saboteur"},{"id":"10536825","text":"SBK may refer to: *SBK Records, former record label *ShoreBank insolvent US community development bank acquired by the Urban Partnership Bank *Silver Bells Killer *Superbike World Championship *SBK: Snowboard Kids, video game *South Brooklyn Railway, reporting mark *Triclopyr herbicide, SBK Brushwood Killer in UK *Sungai Buloh-Kajang Line, metro line * South Bronx Killas, a fictional gang ","title":"SBK"},{"id":"10536832","text":"Logical Domains (LDoms or LDOM) is the server virtualization and partitioning technology for SPARC V9 processors. It was first released by Sun Microsystems in April 2007. After the Oracle acquisition of Sun in January 2010, the product has been re-branded as Oracle VM Server for SPARC from version 2.0 onwards. Each domain is a full virtual machine with a reconfigurable subset of hardware resources. Domains can be securely live migrated between servers while running. Operating systems running inside Logical Domains can be started, stopped, and rebooted independently. A running domain can be dynamically reconfigured to add or remove CPUs, RAM, or I/O devices without requiring a reboot. Using Dynamic Resource Management, CPU resources can be automatically reconfigured as needed.  Supported hardware  SPARC hypervisors run in hyperprivileged execution mode, which was introduced in the sun4v architecture. The sun4v processors released as of October 2015 are the UltraSPARC T1, T2, T2+, T3, T4, T5, M5, M6, M10, and M7. Systems based on UltraSPARC T1 support only Logical Domains versions 1.0-1.2. The newer types of T-series servers support both older Logical Domains and newer Oracle VM Server for SPARC product version 2.0 and later. These include: UltraSPARC T1-based: * Sun / Fujitsu SPARC Enterprise T1000 and T2000 servers * Sun Fire T1000 and T2000 servers * Netra T2000 Server * Netra CP3060 Blade * Sun Blade T6300 Server Module UltraSPARC T2-based: * Sun / Fujitsu SPARC Enterprise T5120 and T5220 servers * Sun Blade T6320 Server Module * Netra CP3260 Blade * Netra T5220 Rackmount Server UltraSPARC T2 Plus systems: * Sun / Fujitsu SPARC Enterprise T5140 and T5240 servers (2 sockets) * Sun / Fujitsu SPARC Enterprise T5440 (4 sockets) * Sun Blade T6340 Server Module (2 sockets) SPARC T3 systems: * Sun / Fujitsu SPARC T3-1 servers (1 socket) * Sun SPARC T3-1B Server Module (1 socket) * Sun / Fujitsu SPARC T3-2 servers (2 sockets) * Sun / Fujitsu SPARC T3-4 servers (4 sockets) SPARC T4 systems * SPARC T4-1 Server (1 socket) * SPARC T4-1B Server Module (blade) * SPARC T4-2 Server (2 sockets) * SPARC T4-4 Server (4 sockets) SPARC T5 systems * SPARC T5-1B Server Module (blade) * SPARC T5-2 Server (2 sockets) * SPARC T5-4 Server (4 sockets) * SPARC T5-8 Server (8 sockets) SPARC T7 systems, which use the same SPARC M7 processor as the M7-8 and M7-16 servers listed below. * SPARC T7-1 (1 CPU socket) * SPARC T7-2 (2 CPU sockets) * SPARC T7-4 (4 CPU sockets) SPARC M-Series systems * Oracle SPARC M5-32 Server (32 sockets) * Oracle SPARC M6-32 Server (32 sockets) * Fujitsu M10-1 (1 socket) * Fujitsu M10-4 (4 sockets) * Fujitsu M10-4S (64 sockets) * Oracle SPARC M7-8 (8 CPU sockets) * Oracle SPARC M7-16 (16 CPU sockets) Technically, the virtualization product consists of two interdependent components: the hypervisor in the SPARC server firmware and the Logical Domains Manager software installed on the Solaris operating system running within the control domain (see Logical Domain roles, below). Because of this, each particular version of Logical Domains (Oracle VM Server for SPARC) software requires a certain minimum version of the hypervisor to be installed into the server firmware. Logical Domains exploits the chip multithreading (CMT) nature of the \\"CoolThreads\\" processors. A single chip contains up to 32 CPU cores, and each core has either four hardware threads (for the UltraSPARC T1) or eight hardware threads (for the UltraSPARC T2/T2+, and SPARC T3/T4 and later) that act as virtual CPUs. All CPU cores execute instructions concurrently, and each core switches between threads‚Äîtypically when a thread stalls on a cache miss or goes idle‚Äîwithin a single clock cycle. This lets the processor gain throughput that is lost during cache misses in conventional CPU designs. Each domain is assigned its own CPU threads and executes CPU instructions at native speed, avoiding the virtualization overhead for privileged operation trap-and-emulate or binary rewrite typical of most VM designs. Each server can support as many as one domain per hardware thread up to a maximum of 128. That's up to 32 domains for the UltraSPARC T1, 64 domains for the UltraSPARC T2 and SPARC T4-1, and 128 domains for UltraSPARC T3 as examples single-processor (single-socket) servers. Servers with 2-4 UltraSPARC T2+ or 2-8 SPARC T3-T5 CPUs support as many logical domains as the number of processors multiplied by the number of threads of each CPU up to the limit of 128. M-series servers can be subdivided into physical domains (\\"PDoms\\"), each of which can host up to 128 logical domains. Typically, a given domain is assigned multiple CPU threads or CPU cores for additional capacity within a single OS instance. CPU threads, RAM, and virtual I/O devices can be added to or removed from a domain by administrator issuing command in the control domain. This change takes effect immediately without the need to reboot the affected domain, which can immediately make use of added CPU threads or continue operating with reduced resources. When hosts are connected to shared storage (SAN or NAS), running guest domains can be securely live migrated between servers without outage (starting with Oracle VM Server for SPARC version 2.1). The process encrypts guest VM memory contents before they are transmitted between servers, using cryptographic accelerators available on all processors with sun4v architecture.  Logical Domain roles  All logical domains are the same except for the roles that they are assigned. There are multiple roles that logical domains can perform such as: * Control domain * Service domain * I/O domain * Root domain * Guest domain Control domain, as its name implies, controls the logical domain environment. It is used to configure machine resources and guest domains, and provides services necessary for domain operation, such as virtual console service. The control domain also normally acts as a service domain. Service domains present virtual services, such as virtual disk drives and network switches, to other domains. In most cases, guest domains perform I/O via bridged access through services domains, which are usually I/O domains and directly connected to the physical devices. Service domains can provide virtual LANs and SANs as well as bridge through to physical devices. Disk images can reside on complete local physical disks, shared SAN block devices, their slices, or even on files contained on a local UFS or ZFS file system, or on a shared NFS export or iSCSI target. Control and service functions can be combined within domains, however it is recommended that user applications not run within control or service domains in order to protect domain stability and performance. I/O domains have direct ownership of a PCI bus, or card on a bus, or Single Root I/O Virtualization (SR-IOV) function, providing direct access to physical I/O devices, such as a network card in a PCI controller. An I/O domain may use its devices to have native I/O performance its own applications, or act as a service domain and share the devices to other domains as virtual devices. Root domains have direct ownership of PCIe \\"root complex\\" and all associated PCIe slots. This can be used to grant access to physical I/O devices. A root domain is also an I/O domain. There are a maximum of two root domains for the UltraSPARC T1 (Niagara) servers, one of which also must be the control domain. UltraSPARC T2 Plus, SPARC T3, and SPARC T4 servers can have as many as 4 root domains, limited by the number of PCIe root complexes installed on the server. SPARC T5 servers can have up to 16 root complex domains. Multiple I/O domains can be configured to provide resiliency against failures. Guest domains run an operating system instance without performing any of the above roles, but leverage the services provided by the above in order to run applications.  Supported guest operating systems  The only operating system supported by the vendor for running within logical domains is Solaris 10 11/06 and later updates, and all Solaris 11 releases. There are operating systems that are not officially supported, but may still be capable of running within logical domains: * Debian portshttps://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/ports/ version * OpenSolaris 2009.06 * Illumos-derived releases * Ubuntu Linux Server Edition * OpenBSD 4.5 or later * Wind River Linux 3.0 * Oracle Linux for SPARC  See also  * Oracle VM Server for x86 * Logical partition  References   External links  * Virtualization Solutions from Oracle.

It is a 65-kDa (G148 protein G) and a 58 kDa (C40 protein G) cell surface protein that has found application in purifying antibodies through its binding to the Fab and Fc region. The native molecule also binds albumin, but because serum albumin is a major contaminant of antibody sources, the albumin binding site has been removed from recombinant forms of Protein G. This recombinant Protein G, either labeled with a fluorophore or a single- stranded DNA strand, was used as a replacement for secondary antibodies in immunofluorescence and super-resolution imaging. Other antibody binding proteins In addition to Protein G, other immunoglobulin-binding bacterial proteins such as Protein A, Protein A/G and Protein L are all commonly used to purify, immobilize or detect immunoglobulins. Each of these immunoglobulin- binding proteins has a different antibody binding profile in terms of the portion of the antibody that is recognized and the species and type of antibodies it will bind. Folding of Protein G, B1 Domain An ab initio simulation of the protein G B1 domain demonstrates that, as earlier results suggested, this protein initiates folding via a nucleation event in the hydrophobic core residues followed by small adjustments. The folding events are as follows: # a Œ≤-hairpin is formed, stabilized by residues W43, Y45, and F52. # Residue contacts between residue F30, in an Œ±-helix, and the Œ≤-hairpin strengthen. # Nucleation of the Œ≤-sheet starting from residues L5 and F52, occurs. # The last nucleation residue, Y3, assists in forming the central part of the Œ≤-sheet resulting in a globular protein. The protein G B1 domain is (aka. GB1) often used as part of a fusion protein to keep other domains in solution during experiments in solution (e.g. NMR). Many previously insoluble domains have become soluble with the fusion of the GB1 domain. The domain is 56 residues (approx 8kDa) long. On SDS-PAGE gels the GB1 domain runs at roughly 13.5kDa despite being only 8kDa.

It was built to carry the ores of copper and tin, and also granite, from their sources on Caradon Hill down to Moorswater for onward transport to market by way of Looe Harbour and coastal shipping. At first this was on the Liskeard and Looe Union Canal and later on the parallel Liskeard and Looe Railway. The Liskeard and Caradon Railway was exceedingly successful while mineral extraction boomed, but it was entirely dependent on that traffic and when the mines and quarries declined, the railway declined too, and eventually failed financially. In 1909 it was purchased by the Great Western Railway, but its days were already numbered, and it closed in 1917, its track materials being removed in aid of the war effort. Origins Traces of copper ore had been discovered in streams for some time, but the turning point was the discovery of copper ore at South Caradon in 1836 by James Clymo and Thomas Kittow. The discovery encouraged the search for the lodes nearby, and in due course these other locations were successfully producing ore. In 1839 granite also was being quarried at the Cheesewring nearby. The heavy minerals needed to be transported to remote markets, and this implied getting them to the coast, for onward transport by coastal shipping. While some material went to St Germans and to the Rover Fowey, the most convenient route was to Moorswater, where the Liskeard and Looe Union Canal had its basin, giving easy connection from there to Looe Harbour. The transport of the ore cost 4s 6d per ton to get to Moorswater; the granite from Cheesewring cost 8s.Michael Messenger, Caradon & Looe - The Canal, Railways and Mines, Twelveheads Press, Truro, 2001 (second edition), By this time, many railways were being successfully operated elsewhere in the country, and in 1842 a committee of interested businessmen proposed a railway to bring the minerals down from Caradon. Robert Coad was the engineer of the neighbouring Canal, and he was asked to prepare an appraisal of the possibilities. His report was presented on 25 June 1842, recommending a mineral railway between the canal at Liskeard and the Caradon Mines, Cheesewring and Tokenbury. The railway was to be capable of gravity operation for the loaded direction, so that the proposed route followed a broadly constant downward gradient at the expense of directness; locomotive or horse power would convey the empty wagons upwards. The line would operate as a toll road, open to independent carriers, with the railway not acting as carrier itself. Captain William Moorsom was engineer to the Cornwall Railway (then being planned) was asked to review Coad's proposals; he approved, with the sole adjustment that horse power would be preferable. The proposed railway swiftly obtained parliamentary approval, on 26 June 1843. The capital of the Liskeard and Caradon Railway company (L&CR;) was to be ¬£12,000 in ¬£25 shares, with authority to borrow ¬£4,000. Horse power was specified in the Act, with a ¬£50 penalty for crossing any turnpike road with a locomotive. The Act had a remarkable 344 clauses and incorporation of the Company took place the following day, 27 June 1843.E F Carter, An Historical Geography of the Railways of the British Isles, Cassell, London, 1959Christopher Awdry, Encyclopaedia of British Railway Companies, Patrick Stephens Limited, Wellingborough, 1990, Construction Liskeard and Caradon Railway: the first lines to 1846Construction started at once; it seems that it was mostly carried out by direct labour under Coad's control. Some modifications to the route were required as Coad's original alignment was found to be impracticable in certain details. Work started at the Cheesewring, and the permanent way used stone block sleepers, the stone blocks being procured at Cheesewring itself. Lower down, serious problems were encountered in gaining possession of land from the Duchy of Cornwall, who were demanding very high prices for the land. The railway construction was costing more than had been estimated, and at the same time some subscribers were not responding to calls on shares they had taken up. The Company found itself unable to pay the Duchy's price. Loans were taken out ‚Äì apparently beyond what was authorised in the Act ‚Äì and to obtain some income the Company decided to open the railway as far as they could, down to Tremabe, on 28 November 1844. It is not clear how attractive the short railway transit was, involving an additional trans-shipment to road transport there. The line was finally extended to Moorswater, opening about 8 March 1846 ‚Äì the date is not certain. The proposed Tokenbury branch was not built, no doubt due to lack of funds. The tunnels originally contemplated were also avoided, but there was a rope worked incline at Gonamena to climb towards Cheesewring. The construction had cost ¬£27,000; about ¬£11,000 of that was beyond the sum authorised by Parliament; by an Act of 25 June 1847 further capital of ¬£10,500 and loans of ¬£3,500 were authorised. Early years Railway memorial.The new railway was operated by gravity and horse traction; Murray's handbook said in 1856: > Towards evening the produce of the mines and quarries is brought down to > Moorswater in detached trucks, which follow one another in succession, under > the control of breaksmen, and are drawn back the next day by horses.Murray's > Handbook for Travellers in Devon and Cornwall, published by John Murray, > London, 1856 Because of this tidal flow arrangement, frequent passing loops were not necessary. Contrary to what was contemplated before the Act, the Company was its own carrier, with the possible exception of the granite traffic from Cheesewring. The track was T-section rail in chairs fixed to stone blocks. It was laid to standard gauge, . Speed was limited to , half that over level crossings. It was graded at about 1 in 60 (1.7%) for most of its length. The Company was immediately successful, with considerable and increasing tonnages conveyed: 10,000 tons were carried in 1849, and net profit was ¬£364. About 70% of the carrying was metal ore downwards, with nearly 30% being coal uphill to fuel the mine engines; the remainder was granite ‚Äì although this did not realise the volumes originally contemplated ‚Äì timber, sand, lime, iron and sundries. The route of the railway was from close to the dressing floors of the South Caradon Mine, south and then westwards on the slope of the valley below Darite, crossing under the road at Polwrath Bridge, and then south-west, turning back eastwards across the northern margin of St Cleer where there was a goods depot. Passing south of Venland Cross, the course then turned west again to Tremabe. It was here that the line terminated in 1844; it is likely that there was no depot here, but simply that the individual wagons were stopped alongside the road and the ores trans-shipped there. At the same time, a branch from near the Cheesewring Quarry ‚Äì the owner, John Trethewey had internal sidings ‚Äì ran broadly south, crossing through what became Minions village, and then descending by the incline at Gonamena, passing South Caradon further up the hillside, and running parallel to the main line, descending and joining it at Polwrath Bridge. When the line was extended in 1846 from Tremabe to Moorswater, it ran west at first, soon turning back on a curve of 3 chains radius (66 yards, 60 m) at Old Treworgy, then turning south and then west, finally descending with the East Looe River all the way to Moorswater, where there were sidings adjacent to the Canal basin. Passengers Disused Liskeard and Caradon Railway bridge, Darite.The L&CR; was conceived as a mineral railway, and the carriage of passengers was not contemplated or authorised. However the rock formation at the Cheesewring was a considerable local attraction, and organised excursions to it were undertaken; the West Briton reported a temperance excursion to the spot in June 1850.The West Briton, 28 June 1850, quoted in Messenger The excursions appear to have been hauled uphill by horse traction and returned by gravity. Individual businessmen appear to have been granted passes on a casual basis; the Company did not have passenger coaches, so any passengers had to travel in wagons, such conveyance being at their own risk. The L&CR; had no powers to carry passengers but did carry them, in open wagons, by using a legal loophole. The passengers travelled free, but a charge was made for the carriage of their hats, coats and parcels, \\"a system not abandoned until 31 December 1916\\". This form of casual passenger carriage had also been taking place on the LLUC's railway. More traffic and more mines View of Phoenix Mine and track of L&CRThe; success of the South Caradon mine encouraged a frenzy of speculative prospecting in the area; and the availability of transport to market further encouraged this. While much of the exploration turned out to be fruitless, there were many good finds as well. West Caradon Mine was soon productive, on the hill opposite South Caradon. The mine owners constructed a tramway on an inclined plane to reach down to the L&CR; Cheesewring branch opposite Crow's Nest, probably by 1849. It was standard gauge on a gradient of 1 in 6, and it was 480 feet (146 m) long.Martin Bodman, Inclined Planes in the South West, Twelveheads Press, Chacewater, 2011, From 1852 ore was discovered at the Phoenix Mine and it became productive by 1854; the mine was a little to the east of Cheesewring Quarry. L&CR; plans in 1854 to build a branch of the L&CR; did not mature, and the mine owners built a narrow gauge tramway westward from their mine to the L&CR; Cheesewring branch just north of Minions. Messenger says (on page 118) that this was \\"about 1850\\". In 1858 traffic carried reached 28,650 tons (copper ore: 16,000 tons; coal: 5,600 tons; granite: 6,572 tons) all of which was carried on the canal also. Net profit was ¬£2,317. Quarrying on Kilmar Tor received a boost from 1856 when a lease was taken from the Duchy of Cornwall for the purpose. The Cheesewring Granite Company LimitedBradshaw's Railway Manual, 1867, describes it as a Limited Company. started to exploit the abundant \\"loose, tumbled granite, easily quarried moorstone\\". Road access was impossible, and the granite company arranged to build a railway to it, and agreed with the L&CR; that the Railway Company would operate it; this may have included maintenance. The line was opened on 26 August 1858. It diverged from the Cheesewring line in Minions village, running broadly north a little lower down the hill, and at first about level; it passed east of Cheesewring Quarry. Messenger says that \\"It must be presumed that it crossed the Phoenix Mine tramway on the level\\". 10,000 tons of granite were brought down it in 1859. In the closing years of the 1850s, the production of South Caradon continued to increase, but West Caradon declined somewhat, and it became clear that the emphasis was moving eastwards, with East Caradon, Glasgow Caradon Consols, and mines in the area of Tokenbury Corner and the Marke Valley starting to become productive. Minerals from these mines were being brought to the surface some distance from the railway. At the same time, the process of transshipping to the canal at Moorswater, and the carrying capacity of the canal itself, were proving serious limitations. In 1859 there were two platelayers and 27 brakesmen. Extensions and locomotives The L&CR; system in 1861The Liskeard and Looe Union Canal company (LLUC) responded to the volumes of traffic by building a railway closely paralleling the canal itself, and extending to the quays at Looe; their railway opened to mineral traffic on 27 December 1860, forming a direct connection with the L&CR; at Moorswater. For the time being the railway, usually referred to as the Liskeard and Looe Railway, was wholly owned by the Canal Company. They hired a locomotive, Liskeard but they used L&CR; wagons. At last the transshipment at Moorswater was eliminated. The L&CR; had applied its attention to the need for connecting the new mines, and obtained an Act of Parliament on 15 May 1860, authorising additional share capital of ¬£12,000; the stated purposes were the construction of a Tokenbury branch, the building of a new line by-passing the Gonamena inclined plane, the acquisition of the Kilmar railway, and several local improvements to the existing lines. The L&CR; evidently saw their sphere of influence as extending from Caradon to the sea at Looe, for the Act also authorised the L&CR; \\"to arrange with the Commissioners of Looe Harbour, with respect to laying down of rails at, and the use of, the works of the Commissioners.\\"Bradshaw's Railway Manual, Shareholders Guide and Official Directory for 1866, published by W J Adams, London, 1866 Not all of these powers were exercised. Work quickly started on the branch to Tokenbury; this ran south and east from the South Caradon terminal, over a high embankment near there; it was opened by May 1861 at the latest, and an extension at Tokenbury to the East Caradon dressing floor nearby was opened too. The earthworks for the line to by-pass Gonamena were started, to the west of the Gonamena line near Ponton's Piece,Messenger refers to this location as Pontius Piece and abutments for a bridge were constructed, but this deviation was never completed. (The embankment is shown on modern 1:25,000 Ordnance Survey maps.) The L&CR; observed that the locomotive Liskeard was operating successfully on the Looe line,It is not clear whether the locomotive was confined to the Looe line alone in this period, or whether the LLUC had used it on the L&CR; track and the L&CR; ordered a locomotive of their own from Gilkes, Wilson and Company; it was delivered in about August 1862: it was an 0-6-0ST, named Caradon. On the original main line, many of the road crossings were level crossings and the authorising Act had forbidden locomotives from crossing the turnpike roads: a ¬£50 penalty was specified. It appears that the company may have violated the law for a period; most of the level crossings were replaced by bridge crossings in due course. In 1864 a third engine, Cheesewring, was acquired. Locomotive maintenance was carried out at a shed at Moorswater. View of Cheesewring Quarry on Caradon from an old postcardThe reality now was that the overwhelmingly dominant traffic was throughout between mines and quarries on Caradon and the harbour at Looe, and in March 1862 a Joint Committee was formed between the L&CR; (three members) and the LLUC (two members); it was agreed that the L&CR; would work all the rail-borne traffic, purchasing the LLUC's locomotive Liskeard for ¬£600,The LLUC had purchased Liskeard from its owner for ¬£600 in September 1861 and setting tolls for carriage throughout between the mines and quarries and Looe Harbour. Copper ore carried on the railways reached 27,000 tons in 1863, but this proved to be a peak and gentle decline followed. Coal carryings peaked at 22,000 tons as the mines went deeper and pumping became dominant. Bodman (page 87) says that: \\"A narrow gauge tramway on an inclined plane was constructed to link Phoenix United with West Phoenix mine some time after 1870. It burrowed under the Kilmar Railway and near its summit ran in cutting, terminating near Stowe's Shaft. The plane was probably self-acting, taking ore down to Phoenix United for processing. Its total length was 1,230 feet (375 m).\\" The reference to West Phoenix is ambiguous, but here it means Stowe's Shaft near Cheesewring. Gamble defines it as \\"Stowe's section, also referred to as West Phoenix Shaft. West Phoenix Mine proper was further west again (south of Witheybrook Marsh)\\".Barry Gamble, Cornish Mines: Gwennap to the Tamar, Alison Hodge, Penzance, 2011, Against the tide, from 1865 The L&CR; system in 1871In the second half of the 1860s the Company started systematically upgrading the track, beginning the task of replacing the stone block sleepers with timber, and making a start on replacing level crossings with bridges (starting with Woodhill) and a third new locomotive, to be called Kilmar, was acquired in 1869. In 1868 the Kilmar branch (still in independent ownership) was extended with a tramway to Bearah.Report in the Western Daily Mercury, 28 May 1868, quoted in Messenger In 1869 a branch line was built from Minions to Phoenix Mine. This replaced, and partly followed the alignment of, an earlier tramway. In 1871 a new line into Cheesewring Quarry at a lower level was constructed. In this period the world prices of the minerals were reducing, and this affected the profitability of the mines considerably; this impacted also the level of tolls the company could demand, and therefore its own financial status. The improvements undertaken cost heavily, and the finances of the company were under considerable strain. Operating expenses had increased more than fivefold while income had nearly tripled. Moreover, the focus of mineral extraction was moving east and north, away from the railway, compelling it to build extensions to retain the business. L&CR; boundary post near GonamenaThe branch to Marke Valley, and a further extension around Caradon Hill, called the Kilmar Junction Railway, opened in August and November 1877. The Kilmar Junction line, although a circuitous route, connected the locations from Minions northwards without the use of the Gonamena Incline, which was closed immediately. The North Kilmar branch (from the Kilmar line) was opened in 1879, evidently using stone block sleepers from the Gonamena incline. The Kilmar line was not the property of the L&CR;, but was worked by it, and this probably included any maintenance, as well as this extension work. Entirely remote from roads and habitation, it was apparently built without Parliamentary sanction. Ruined bridge for the Tokenbury line at Minions; the line passed round the left of Caradon Hill (right)In 1877 the company was taking stock of its situation, and it decided to regularise its relationship with the LLUC's railway; it had been working that line without a formal contractual arrangement. It developed proposals to lease the line, and prepared a Bill in Parliament to confirm the lease, and also to construct a connection to the line of the Cornwall Railway; that company had opened a line between Plymouth and Truro in 1859, passing Liskeard broadly east-west at a high level, and crossing the LLUC line by a viaduct. This would have strained the financial resources of the L&CR; and the Bill was in fact allowed to lapse. A formal agreement was made on 29 January 1878 to lease the entire LLUC undertaking;The railway and the canal; the 1877 proposal may only have included the LLUC's railway this was effective from 27 February 1878. There had long been pressure for the provision of a formal passenger service on the Looe line, and this started between Looe and Moorswater on 11 September 1879, worked by the L&CR.; That line was being managed by the L&CR;, and the considerable upgrading works required to obtain Board of Trade approval for passenger operation were carried out by the L&CR.; The process is more fully described at the Liskeard and Looe Railway article. At this time the L&CR; made informal enquiries about authorising passenger traffic on its own lines, and a response from Colonel Rich (of the Railway Inspectorate, visiting to approve the Looe line's passenger facilities) was not discouraging. However the proposal seems to have been dropped, probably from simple financial considerations. In June 1880 the Company approached the Cornwall Railway for help in subsidising a road coach between their Liskeard station and Moorswater to facilitate passenger transfer, but this was refused by the CR.R J Woodfin, The Cornwall Railway to its Centenary in 1959, Bradford Barton, Truro, 1972, A struggle for new income ‚Äì and survival ‚Äì from 1882 L&CR; system in 1879 The Liskeard and Caradon Railway Bill passed its third reading in the House of Commons on 26 June 1882 and received the Prince of Wales (as Duke of Cornwall) consent for seven more branches, totalling 12 miles. Two of these had already been built: the Phoenix Mine line and the Kilmar Junction Railway; as they crossed moorland, it is likely that the formality had not previously been thought necessary. An extension of over five miles to Trewint, near Altarnun, was planned, possibly to be extended to Camelford or Launceston, as a reaction to feared incursion into the area by other railways, and to open up mineral extraction in the area. The line was to cost ¬£15,000 and the hoped-for subscription to fund the capital expenditure was not forthcoming. The L&CR; plainly did not have the financial resources to construct such a line, and only a couple of miles of earthworks were constructed before being abandoned. The earthworks are clearly shown, labelled \\"Dismtd Rly\\" near Smallacombe on the 1:25,000 Ordnance Survey map.Ordnance Survey Explorer Map Sheet 109, Bodmin Moor Other lines authorised by the Act included a connection from Moorswater to Liskeard; this too was not built, and the only new line authorised and actually built was a 400-yard connection at Rillaton (just north of Minions), providing a proper connection between the Kilmar Junction line and the Cheesewring line. Prior to this, and since the closure of the Gonamena incline, trains from Cheesewring Quarry to Moorswater had to reverse in Minions village and again on the Phoenix line. The reversal at Minions blocked the main street and had led to complaints. Sleeper blocks incorporated into the east abutment of Woodhill Bridge; originally there was a level crossing, and the bridge replaced it in 1884; the blocks were available as a result of conversion of some of the track to cross-sleepers Even as the L&CR;'s financial position declined steeply, the idea of reaching the Launceston area continued to be developed as a solution (by bringing in new income to replace the declining mineral business) and a new Act was obtained on 28 July 1884 to extend the unbuilt Trewint line by another 9¬Ω miles. The Act also authorised a new lease of the LLUC's railway for 30 years. Passenger traffic, as a source of income, was once again proposed, and Col Rich of the Railway Inspectorate was asked to assess the line as a Light Railway. His report was very critical, due to the very sharp curves, worn out track, lack of signals and lack of gates and supervision at level crossings. Alarmingly the Board of Trade examined his report and drew the L&CR;'s attention to the prohibition on crossing public roads with steam locomotives under the original 1843 Act, \\"and that penalties were being incurred daily\\". The Company replied that three of seven level crossings had been replaced with bridges since 1860, and they gave instructions for the remainder to be dealt with. However Rich suggested that passengers could be carried \\"gratuitously\\" and this practice seems to have been adopted. Passengers were carried free, but they had first to purchase a ticket to Looe! A first class ticket cost 2s 6d and entitled the holder to ride in the van; third class was 1s 4d and the holder rode in open wagons. A 1910 periodical reported that at about this time travellers could be issued with a free pass if they paid for the carriage of an umbrella or hat.Railway and Travel Monthly, November 1910, quoted in Messenger L&CR; system in 1884School parties were frequently carried however; occasionally these amounted to forty wagons hauled by two or three locomotives; when the destination was on the moor, \\"even these lengthy trains returned by gravity with the locomotives following\\". The income from these carryings was wiped out when in 1885 the South Caradon mine ceased operation, followed quickly by the other Caradon Hill workings; the L&CR; was letting contracts for the Trewint extension and at the same time finding itself unable to repay borrowings as they came due. The crisis had no solution, and on 13 October 1886 the Liskeard and Caradon Railway went into receivership. The company continued to trade, and it was making a modest, but declining, operating profit. From 1886 however there were insufficient funds to pay the LLUC lease charge, and that company too then found itself in difficulty. Drastic operating economies were put in place. In November 1885 the locomotive Kilmar had broken down, leaving only Cheesewring serviceable. An 0-6-0T hired from Peckett's of Bristol had already been returned to the owners. Money was somehow found for a new boiler for Kilmar and, astonishingly, money was found for an Act of Parliament, passed in 1887, to extend the time allowed for construction of the Trewint extension. In 1892 a further Act was obtained allowing extra time for the line beyond Trewint to Launceston, and to constitute that as a separate concern, the Launceston Railway. In 1890 the Board of Trade ordered that the block system and continuous brakes be instituted on the lines (L&CR; and the LLUC line, for which the L&CR; had responsibility). The block system is a train control procedure in which a railway line is considered to be divided into sections, and no train may enter a section unless it can be verified that no other train is in the section. See Signalling block system. Continuous brakes are brakes that can be controlled throughout the train by the driver, and if they are automatic brakes then they are automatically applied in both portions if the train becomes accidentally divided. See Railway brake. This was another unwanted expense, and the Company tried to negotiate an exemption; but eventually vacuum brakes were fitted, and the One engine in steam operating system was instituted, achieving the object of the block system. The Looe line reaches Liskeard With the L&CR; in receivership and defaulting on payments due to the LLUC, the latter looked gloomily at the declining fortunes of mineral extraction on Caradon, and the idea of an extension to the Cornwall Railway's main line at Liskeard was raised again. (The Great Western Railway absorbed the Cornwall Railway in 1895; their broad gauge line had been converted to standard gauge in 1892.) A number of schemes were considered over a decade or so, culminating in the Liskeard and Looe Railway Extension Act of 1895. This authorised a connecting line from Coombe to Liskeard, on a very steep gradient and forming almost a complete circle to gain height. The LLUC Company name was finally changed to the Liskeard and Looe Railway (L&LR;); new capital was authorised, but was very hard to find, until a Captain John Spicer, not a local man, offered to subscribe a large sum in purchasing both preference and ordinary shares. After some delay this was done, and Spicer acquired a controlling interest in the L&LR.; The Company could now proceed to build the connecting line, and work started in 1898. It opened on 8 May 1901. The L&LR; had given the receiver of the L&CR; notice that it would work its line itself, and that it would take over the operation of the L&CR; in accordance with the terms of the earlier lease. The two lines were now operated under common management. Nonetheless the L&CR; receiver claimed for the value of the L&CR;'s equipment taken over, and after protracted legal processes, the L&LR; were compelled to pay ¬£3,850 to the L&CR; receiver; the money was distributed among that Company's shareholders. The L&LR; passenger operation grew enormously, but despite some small new traffics, the L&CR; continued to decline. The weak and worn out track was also expensive to keep in repair: maintenance costs per train mile were three times the English average. The cost of construction of the Liskeard extension had overrun very considerably, and Spicer footed the escalating bill. Despite the relative profitability of the L&LR; it was unable to pay interest charges consistently, and paradoxically it now failed to pay the L&CR; lease charge, and the L&CR; receiver took action against the L&LR.; Hopelessly unable to pay off its huge debts, the company looked for a purchaser in the Great Western Railway (GWR). The GWR was anxious to keep the rival London and South Western Railway out of the area, and agreed to purchase the L&CR.; Owned by the Great Western Railway The purchase took effect from 1 July 1909, the GWR having taken over maintenance from 1 January. They also agreed to work the L&LR; from 1 January 1909. The Great Western Railway, Liskeard & Looe and Liskeard & Caradon Railways Act was passed on 25 May 1909, confirming the changes. A liquidator was appointed; and Captain Spicer lost a considerable amount of money. The GWR soon had a thorough technical assessment of the L&CR; line done, and for a short time passenger trains, or even revival of the extension to Launceston, were under consideration. However the very poor state of the track soon put paid to these ideas, and the GWR turned to consideration of road motor service to the area. There were sporadic signs of a resurgence of mineral extraction in the L&CR; area, but the commercial possibilities were limited, and the outbreak of the First World War in July 1914 finished off the projects. The GWR announced a temporary closure of the L&CR; lines \\"to assist the war effort\\" on 1 January 1917, and the rails were taken up.E T MacDermot, History of the Great Western Railway, vol II, published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1931 The GWR continued to pay the wayleave rental to the Duchy of Cornwall for the Phoenix and Cornwall lines until 1933, but legal abandonment of the L&CR; lines took place in 1931. Locomotives Ownership of locomotives as between the LLUC and L&CR;, and whether they worked on both railways, is sometimes uncertain. *Liskeard was a 0-4-0ST locomotive, probably made by the Bury locomotive company, possibly originally a tender locomotive. She was hired from James Murphy of Newport, South Wales, in 1860 and later purchased. She was sold back to James Murphy in 1866. *Caradon was a 0-6-0ST supplied new to the railway in 1862 by Gilkes Wilson and Company, works number 138. She had outside cylinders 13in x 24in and 4 ft 0in driving wheels. The boiler was of the conventional type with the firebox located between the second and third axles. She was scrapped about 1907. *Cheesewring was another 0-6-0ST supplied new in 1865, (Mitchell and Smith say \\"constructed in 1864 for the LCR\\") also by Gilkes Wilson and Company, works number 195. Again, she had outside cylinders 13in x 24in and 4 ft 0in driving wheels but she differed from Caradon in being of the \\"long boiler\\" type with the firebox behind the third axle. She was rebuilt in Swindon in 1907 and became GWR number 1311 and was scrapped in 1919. There were no flanges on the centre wheels. *Kilmar was another long boiler 0-6-0ST supplied new in 1869 by Hopkins Gilkes and Company (successors to Gilkes, Wilson and Co), works number 264. She was similar to Cheesewring but with a shorter tank and modified boiler fittings. Driving wheels were, again, 4 ft 0in diameter and cylinders were either 12in x 24in or 14in x 24in (sources disagree; Messenger says 13in x 24in). She was the only locomotive recorded to have been involved in an accident on the L&CR; when a load of granite blocks that she was hauling managed to move the rails apart when heavy rain softened the ground sufficiently for the blocks holding the rails to move. While several wagons fell between the rails, Kilmar was unaffected, continuing her journey and returning the following day with a gang and lifting tackle. She became GWR number 1313 (Mitchell and SmithVic Mitchell and Keith Smith, Branch Lines to Looe, 1998, Middleton Press, Midhurst, say 1312) and was scrapped in 1914. *Looe was a 0-6-0ST supplied new in 1901 by Robert Stephenson and Company, works number 3050. She had outside cylinders 16in x 20in and driving wheels 3 ft 3in or 3 ft 6in diameter (sources disagree). She was found to be too heavy, with a high centre of gravity and a short wheelbase ‚Äì damaging the track and causing derailments ‚Äì so she was sold in 1902 to the London and East India Docks Railway (later the Port of London Authority), becoming PLA number 11. She was scrapped in December 1950. *Lady Margaret was an inside-cylinder 2-4-0T supplied new in 1902 or 1904 by Andrew Barclay and Company. Dimensions were: cylinders 14¬Ωin x 22in; driving wheels 4 ft 0in; leading wheels 2 ft 7¬Ωin. She is recorded as the usual motive power for trains to Looe from 1904 and she subsequently became GWR No. 1308. She had moved to Garnant by 1922 and was scrapped about 1948, her last shed being Oswestry. *A Peckett 0-6-0ST was hired in, during the period 1885 - 1886, works number 444; she had 14in x 20 in cylinders and 3 ft 6¬Ωin driving wheels. After 1909, various GWR locomotives began to appear on the line, including 1901 class Saddle tanks and 2021 class 0-6-0PT. Later, 2-6-2T of classes 4400 and 4500 were also used. In addition, experimental locomotive No. 13, then a 4-4-0T and originally built by the GWR in 1886, was recorded as being allocated to Moorswater shed in 1922. Note: not all of the above details are verifiable in available sources, but the primary outline is in Messenger. Mileages Cooke gives milepost mileages for the line on adoption by the GWR (when the Gonamena incline had closed); from a zero at Looe the Moorswater point of junction was 7m 29c; South Caradon was 13m 66c. Tokenbury Corner (via reversal) was 14m 79c; Minions was 17m 16c; Cheesewring Quarry was 17m 67c; and Kilmar Tor was 19m 50c.R A Cooke, Atlas of the Great Western Railway as at 1947, Wild Swan Publications Ltd, Didcot, 1997, (Railway distances were measured in miles and chains; there are 80 chains in a mile. One mile = 1.61 km.) MacDermot gives the aggregate mileage at closure as 12m 45c. Notes References Further reading * Popplewell, Lawrence (1977) The Railways, Canal and Mines of Looe and Liskeard.

During the 1930s gold production in the State increased from ¬£1,600,000 to ¬£11,800,000 and employment in the industry quadrupled due in considerable part to de Bernales' marketing of the goldfields to overseas investors. De Bernales accumulated immense wealth through complex and elaborate schemes by which he acquired many mining companies and attracted overseas investment and personal support. In the latter part of his life however, financial difficulties and ill-health saw him live as a recluse in Selsey, Sussex, United Kingdom. Early life De Bernales was born in Brixton, London, the son of a Syracuse, New York-born Basque, Manuel Edgar Albo de Bernales, and his American wife Emma Jane, n√©e Belden. He was educated at a variety of schools in the US, Britain and Europe, including one year (1891) at Uppingham School in Rutland in the East Midlands of England, and later at Neuenheim College (now called Heidelberg College) in Heidelberg in the Rhineland, Germany. In 1897 de Bernales emigrated to the Western Australian goldfields, drawn like many other European immigrants to the lure of the gold rush of the region. Goldfields His first job was running Western Machinery Company, Limited, which supplied and financed various mining machinery purchases for the hundreds of large and small gold mining companies in the region. On 19 May 1903 de Bernales married Bessie Picken Berry at Kalgoorlie. His business contacts continued to expand and in 1909 became managing director of a major mining plant supplier, Kalgoorlie Foundry, Ltd. In 1911, he purchased The Laurels, a Federation Queen Anne style house in Cottesloe, renaming it Overton Lodge after the house in Brixton, London, where he was born. In 1938 he redeveloped it into an ostentatious Inter-war Spanish Mission style mansion. The house and its grounds are now the Cottesloe Civic Centre. In 1912 he became a director of foundry operators Hoskins & Co, Ltd in Perth. During this time, he developed his fort√© as a mining promoter while acquiring leases through defaults by some of his clients at Kalgoorlie and Wiluna. These leases were eventually used to form the Wiluna Gold Mines company which he owned jointly with several overseas companies including Consolidated Gold Fields of South Africa. In 1926 he went to London and raised ¬£1 million to develop the Wiluna leases. A later issue of promissory notes for ¬£300,000 was backed by the State government, after de Bernales fostered a close alliance with the Governor of Western Australia, Colonel Sir William Campion. Campion would later become a close business associate and took chairmanship roles of a number of de Bernales' companies including Anglo- Australian Gold Development Co. and Commonwealth Mining and Finance Co. Ltd. Following Bessie's death in 1927, de Bernales married Helen Florence Berry (n√©e Halse - the war widow of his first wife's brother James Berry), in Colombo in January 1928, then later on 5 February 1930 at St Phillips, Cottesloe. Using London capital, the Wiluna mines were expanded and by 1934, 10,000 people had settled there and gold worth ¬£3 million had been extracted. The Wiluna mine ultimately earned ¬£12 million and provided an impetus for other mines in the region. With the onset of the Great Depression, de Bernales campaigned for government support of the gold mining industry, arguing that investment would enable the industry to continue to operate throughout the depression as unemployment rose to 25%. He devised a gold bonus campaign, where the Federal government would pay a 'bounty' of ¬£1 an ounce on gold produced in excess of the 1928-30 average. Not surprisingly, the idea had widespread support from his fellow entrepreneurs and state government politicians. De Bernales led several delegations to the eastern states to lobby for the scheme which was known as the 'Gold Bounty Acts', but by the time it became law in 1930 and 1931, the exchange rate had collapsed and price of gold had risen to well above the rate of the bounty paid. Following the depression, in 1933 the state government granted temporary reserves over prospective gold areas in the eastern and northern goldfields to encourage new investment in gold development, primarily to Western Mining Corporation and to companies associated with de Bernales. De Bernales moved to London in 1932, forming several investment companies which he promoted to seek new capital for mining leases on the new land reservations. Capital of ¬£1,261,000 was raised, though much of the land was unproven. In 1933‚Äì35, yet more companies and another ¬£6,110,000 was pumped into his leases. By now, de Bernales' fundraising represented a major proportion of overseas capital inflows for Australian mining and the Western Australian economy as a whole. In 1936, he won control of one of the oldest and richest mines of the 'Golden Mile', the Great Boulder Proprietary Gold Mine. He also developed new mines at Mount Palmer which returned ¬£200,000 to investors in the first 2 years and to the north at Marble Bar. In 1935-36 he returned to Western Australia with ex- governor Campion, being feted by local politicians acknowledging his ambassadorial role for the state. At that time he acquired properties in Melbourne and Perth and commissioned the well-known London Court shopping arcade in the Perth CBD. De Bernales returned to London, but from 1939 his empire started to encounter difficulties. The Great Boulder mine went into liquidation and its shareholders sought recovery of their losses, accusing de Bernales of mismanagement. The London Stock Exchange suspended trading in several of his companies in July 1939 which sent them also into liquidation. An extensive investigation into de Bernales' Commonwealth Group of companies by Sir William McClintock for the Board of Trade was made during 1939 and 1940. This uncovered income tax liabilities from share dealings on profits of ¬£1,382,000. These were however, never brought to trial as the case arguments dragged on for ten years. Between 1945 and 1948, the official receiver undertook further investigations but partly due to his failing health the claims were finally settled for just ¬£125,000. In the meantime, a concerted attack campaign by Lord Beaverbrook's influential Daily Express continued. Later life De Bernales became a recluse at his home The White House, a house with private beach in Selsey, Sussex, near Chichester. His second wife Helen Florence died there on 27 May 1956. De Bernales died at the Chelsea, London home of one of his daughters, on 9 December 1963, survived by daughters Daphne and Betty, from his first marriage. One of his grandchildren was Anthony Trethowan, who became a member of parliament.Condolence Motion for Father Anthony Trethowan, MLA (Parliament of Western Australia Hansard), 24 June 2015.

Design Both spacecraft had a polygonal shape, and were approximately 137 cm in diameter and 115 cm high. Each also had a 200-cm radio antenna and two 6-meter booms which were needed to distance some of the equipment from the main body of the spacecraft. They were stacked on top of each other and launched aboard a Delta 3000 booster rocket. Upon reaching orbit, the two spacecraft departed from the booster and entered separate orbits. Dynamics Explorer 1 was placed into a high altitude elliptical orbit, while DE-2 was put into a lower orbit that was also more circular. =Dynamics Explorer 1 Instrumentation= Dynamics Explorer 1 carried the following instruments: *Plasma Wave Instrument (PWI), which measured auroral kilometric radiation, auroral hiss, Z-mode radiation, and narrow band electromagnetic emissions. *The Spin-scan Auroral Imager (SAI) *The Retarding Ion Mass Spectrometer (RIMS) *Energetic Ion Composition Spectrometer (EICS) *High Altitude Plasma Instrument (HAPI) *Magnetic Field Observations Triaxial Fluxgate Magnetometer (MAG-A) In addition, there were two Earth-based investigations, Auroral Physics Theory and Controlled and Naturally Occurring Wave Particle Interactions Theory.

He was a Professor of Government, author of many books on contemporary politics and economics. Personal life and education Born in Colchester, Essex, Haseler attended Westcliff High School for Boys, Southend, and then University College, London and the London School of Economics (LSE). He was awarded a BSc(Econ.) in 1963 and a PhD in 1967 for his thesis on Revisionism in the British Labour Party during the post-war period. Haseler married (Roberta) Bay Haseler from New York in 1967, and they lived together in London and Washington DC.  Political involvement  Haseler had a long record of political involvement in Britain, having stood for election to the British Parliament for the Labour Party in Saffron Walden at the 1966 general election, when he was the youngest candidate in the country, and in the 1970 general election for the Maldon constituency. He was elected to the Greater London Council for the Wood Green division in 1973, where he was appointed chairman of the General Purposes Committee.'Young newcomers in Labour GLC team of committee chiefs', Times, 21 April 1973. In June 1975 he became a founder and joint secretary of the Social Democratic Alliance (SDA), a grassroots organisation established on the right of the party to combat \\"entryism\\" by extra-parliamentary Marxist and Trotskyist organisations, such as Militant and the International Socialists. Although the new group was supported by the Cabinet minister Reg Prentice, who declared that he would speak in its support on \\"any platform\\", the decision to criticise mainstream Labour politicians and trade unionists - including Michael Foot and the railwaymen's leader Sid Weighell - for writing opinion pieces in Communist-backed newspapers did not go down well.‚ÄòEast Wind Over Blackpool‚Äô, SDA newsletter, issue no. 2, 28 September 1975 Harold Wilson, speaking at the party conference that year, attacked the SDA as an \\"anti-party group which has been disporting itself in Blackpool this weekend, leaking‚Ä¶ their smears to an ever-ready Tory press.\\"Labour Party, Report of the 74th Annual Conference (London, 1975), p.187.

He went on to become a founder member of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) the following year,Peter Barberis et al., Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations, p.358 and in 1982 stood to become the party's president, but took last place with 14.8% of the vote. He later became co-chair of the Radical Society (1988‚Äì96) and Chair of the pressure group Republic (1990‚Äì2004) and honorary chair from 2004-2007. He was on the Pro-Euro Conservative Party list for the London constituency in 1999 European Parliament elections. Although initially an opponent of Britain's membership of the European Economic Community (as it was then), he later became a staunch European federalist who believed that the only credible future for the UK is in the European Union, and that the only viable future for the peoples of Europe lies in a United States of Europe.  Academic interests  His specialisms were British politics, the UK Constitution, Transatlantic relations and European defence. However, following the publication of his book The Super-Rich (Macmillan 2001), he wrote and lectured on the Global Financial Crisis and Global Politics and rising economic inequality. Haseler was also an authority on the British monarchy and as an advocate of radical constitutional change, including a written constitution and a republican form of government. He regularly appeared on national television and radio in the UK and wrote for national newspapers on these subjects. He served on the board of The American International University in London, and was a senior fellow at the Federal Trust. Formerly the Director of The Global Policy Institute based at London Metropolitan University, he held Visiting Professorships at Georgetown University, Johns Hopkins University, George Mason University and the University of Maryland- Baltimore County. He was an Emeritus Professor at London Metropolitan University and a Senior Fellow at The Federal Trust. Publications Haseler published extensively, including The Gaitskellites (Macmillan, 1969), The Death of British Democracy (Elek, 1976), The Tragedy of Labour (Blackwells, Oxford, 1981), The Battle for Britain: Thatcher and the New Liberals (I.B.

It had a population of 59,170 in 2007, making it the 28th largest city per geographical entity in Syria. In antiquity it was the city of Neve in the Roman province of Arabia Petraea. History Nawa has been identified as the city that Job dwelled in and the burial place of Shem, the son of Noah.le Strange, 1890, p.516 During the Roman and Byzantine era it had a large Jewish population.Midrash Rabba (Lamentations Rabba 1:60); Martin Goodman, Jews in a Graeco-Roman World, Clarendon Press: Oxford 2002, p. 70 ; H√ºttenmeister and Reeg, Die antike Synagogen in Israel (vol. 1), Wiesbaden 1977, pp. 336‚Äì339 ; G.

Heinrich Gelzer, 54) in the 7th century. Numerous basalt architectural members dating to the Byzantine period bearing Jewish symbols‚Äîmost prominently the menorah‚Äîwere discovered ire used as spolia within Nawa (A. Reifenberg, 'Ancient Hebrew Arts', 1952). Under the Islamic Caliphate of the Rashidun, Umayyads, and Abbasids, it was a part of Jund Dimashq and the principal city of Hauran. Al-Mas'udi wrote in 943 that a mosque dedicated to Job was located from Nawa.Le Strange, 1890, p.515 By the 13th century, its status declined; Yaqut al-Hamawi recorded in 1225 that Nawa was \\"a small town of the Hauran\\", formerly the capital of the region. In 1233, Imam Yahya ibn Sharaf al-Nawawi, a prominent Muslim scholar, was born in the city.Yahya ibn Sharaf al-Nawawi (d. 676/1277) In 1596 Nawa appeared in the Ottoman tax registers as Nawi and was part of the nahiya of Jaydur in the Hauran Sanjak. It had an entirely Muslim population consisting of 102 households and 43 bachelors. The villagers paid a fixed tax-rate of 40% on wheat, barley, summer crops, goats and/or beehives; a total of 26,000 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 207 In July 2018, the citizens of Nawa were subject to heavy Syrian government and Russian military bombardment, in an effort to rid the city from its anti-government forces. Ecclesiastical history The bishopric of Neve (Nawa) was a suffragan of Bostra, the metropolitan see of Arabia Petraea. Two of its bishops are known: *Petronius, who attended the Council of Ephesus in 431; *Jobius, who was present at the Council of Chalcedon in 451. Isaac, mentioned by Le Quien as a third bishop, of about 540 (Oriens christiana, II, 864), was a bishop not of Neve but of Nineve, and lived at the end of the seventh century (\\"√âchos d'Orient\\", IV, 11). The Diocese of Neve is noticed in the Notitia episcopatuum of the patriarchate of Antioch in the 6th century (\\"√âchos d'Orient\\", X, 145).

The facility, approximately m long and 50 m wide, could seat up to 30000 spectators. Today, the northern curved part of the stadium is partially restored and is one of the most recognisable landmarks of the city among the many preserved buildings from Roman times.  Location  Today, the stadium is located in the centre of Plovdiv, under the main pedestrian street. The northern end of the edifice can be observed at Dzhumayata Square. The larger portion still lies beneath the buildings along the main street, running south from the visible part where parts are visible in basements of several shops. Unusually, it was situated within the fortified city close to the walls (most stadia elsewhere were placed outside the walls), in the natural bowl-shaped terrain between Taksim Tepe and Sahat Tepe.  The Stadium  Map of the discovered part of the stadium Model of the full size of stadium The stadium was built in the beginning of the 2nd century AD during the reign Emperor Hadrian (117-138). Approximately m long and 50 m wide, it could seat up to 30000 spectators. The length of the track is one stadion - 625 Roman steps or 600 Greek steps, or approx . The spectators' seats are tiered in 14 rows, crossed by stepped aisles down to the track. The seats are made of solid marble blocks (40 cm high and 75 cm wide) and the front parts are decorated with stylized lion paws. The front part of the lowest row is revetted with massive marble 1.80 metre plates (orthostats) on solid marble blocks. The seats from the highest row had backrests. Ancient Stadium of Philippopolis The northern curved part of the stadium is in situ in Dzhumaya Square. Also a covered vaulted passage under the tiered rows of seats (cavea) links the track with the outside Roman road next to the city walls. In the 4th century AD this area was crossed by an ancient aqueduct the arch support of which remain. Like the other imperial buildings for spectacular events, the stadium had its seats of honuor preserved by inscriptions in the marble blocks. Seats with Greek inscriptions were found, proving the existence of special seats for members of higher public position. The main southern entrance to the stadium is formed by masonry pillars decorated with marble pilasters and reliefs. On the pilasters there are busts of Hermes (hermai) with placed above them prize vases with palm sprays, accompanied by Hercules‚Äô attributes ‚Äì lion skin, a mace and a quiver. In front of the entrance a granite pavement was uncovered, consisting of hexagonal blocks ‚Äì 0.70 by 0.70 m diagonally. The outside walls of the cavea are built from granite ashlars, labelled with letters at some places. The architectural marble elements of the entrance and the orthostats on the front row were tied to each other with lead-set iron cramps.  The Games  The sfendona and Dzhumaya mosque - view from the stadium track. According to the epigraphic and numismatic monuments games similar to the Pythian Games in Greece were held in the town. To honour the visit of the Roman emperor Caracalla in 214 the games were called Alexandrian while the games for the visit of emperor Elagabalus in 218 were called Kedrisian Games. The games were organised by the General Assembly of the province of Thrace. In their honour the royal mint of Trimontium coined money featuring the face of the ruling emperor as well as the types of athletic events held in the Ancient Stadium. A marble slab stone was found during the excavations of the sfendona proving that there were games celebrating the favourite man of emperor Hadrian ‚Äì Antinous. The votive tablet dedicated to Antinous is exhibited in the Regional Archaeological Museum - Plovdiv. Athletes competed in two categories of age ‚Äì men and boys. Agonothetes (organisers of the sport events) presided over the games. The latter started with a contest for criers and buglers. Sporting events were usually accompanied by music, poetry and art contests. Restoration and conservation  The stadium was discovered in 1923. More elaborate excavations were undertaken about half a century later by the archaeologist Liliya Botusharova. Archaeological Research and Exhibition of the Stadium In 1995 the Ancient Stadium of Philippopolis was listed as a cultural value of national significance. In 2010-2013, the area around the stadium was further renovated.

Old Square is a public square and road junction in the Core area of Birmingham City Centre, England. Prior to construction The site of the square was formerly occupied the Priory of St Thomas of Canterbury, with The Minories, Upper Priory and Lower Priory being the original entrance roads to the hospital. The land is believed to have once been the highest point in Birmingham city centre leading to the construction of the priory. In 1536, the Priory was dissolved and the structures on site were demolished in 1547. The site remained as ruins for 150 years until it was purchased by John Pemberton in 1697. He further levelled the land for construction work to create his Priory estate. Redevelopment William Westley's print of Old Square in 1732 The square dates from 1713 when it was recorded as having 16 uniform two-storied houses with five-bayed fronts having angle pilasters, pedimented doorways, and dormer windows. It was created as the centrepiece to John Pemberton's Priory Estate. It was designed by William Westley who produced a print of the square's layout in 1732. From old conveyances, it is recorded that 20s. per yard frontage was paid for the site of some of the houses in the square and up to 40s. in Bull Street; the back plots, including the Friends' burial ground (once gardens to the front houses) being valued at 1s. to 2s. per yard. One of the corner houses, originally called \\"the Angle House\\", was popular in that it was sold in 1791 for ¬£420, increasing to ¬£970 in 1805. In 1843 the price increased ¬£1,330 and in 1853, ¬£2,515. 'The Old Square', Birmingham The centre of the square itself was closed off with iron railings with several pedestrian paths. Over time it became neglected and in 1832 it was the scene of a public demonstration. The stones there were used as missiles by the crowd during the parliamentary elections of that year. The trees and railings were removed during 1836 and 1837 as a result of many accidents occurring there due to the roadways being narrow and dangerous. Following this, the Birmingham Street Commissioners widened the roads. Construction of Corporation Street Map showing the square in 1797 and 1897, from Memorials of the Old Square, by Joseph Hill (1897) The square was to suffer a major demolition programme in 1882 to make way for the construction of Corporation Street. Buildings that were constructed as a result were of grand architecture, one of which was the Grand Theatre to the south of the square. Lewis's Department store was constructed at the western end to replace Berlin House and to build over the Minories in 1885 following personal persuasion from Joseph Chamberlain. During the Victorian era, the square became a tram junction for trams running along Corporation Street and those coming from Upper Priory. World War II and postwar years Old Square by Kenneth Budd, 1967 During World War II, a hole was dug next to Lewis's Department Store and above it, a bomb shelter was built. The shelter did not suffer any damage however nearby areas along Corporation Street did suffer direct hits.Forward (Issue 38): Chris Upton's Bygone Brum, 12 July 2006, Birmingham City Council thumb The square was to become subject to more development during the post-war years when the land leases given to the builders of Corporation Street during the 1880s expired. This resulted in the demolition of many Victorian buildings. As one major part of the development of Old Square, Lower Priory to the south was converted into the Priory Queensway, which required the road to be widened and elevated. To do this, the Grand Theatre was demolished and an underground car park was constructed beneath. The Priory Queensway made it possible for the construction of Priory Square by Sir Frederick Gibberd in the southwestern corner of the square. In the southeast, another development to complement the new shopping centre was constructed. Pedestrians were relegated to subterranean subways, although these converged in an uncovered area, but below road level. Recent history In the early 2000s, Old Square was significantly redeveloped, to raise pedestrian routes through the square to the surface. As part of the development, the Priory Queensway was reconstructed as a sloping road following the gradient of the Birmingham city ridge as a result of the demolition of Masshouse Circus. In 2006, refurbishment work on Cannon House to the northeast of the square commenced to convert it into Grade A office space. The development by Nurton Developments, who acquired the building in June 2004, also transformed the exterior. Proposed future work to the square includes the redevelopment of Priory Square to create Martineau Galleries by the Birmingham Alliance. In the centre of Old Square is a memorial dedicated to Tony Hancock, who was born in the Hall Green area of the city. The memorial, by Bruce Williams, was unveiled by Sir Harry Secombe on 13 May 1996. The memorial was originally intended to be placed on New Street but a temporary site on the Corporation Street edge of the square was found (at the time, it stood opposite a Blood Donor clinic, in a nod to Hancock's well-known sketch). The statue was relocated to the centre of Old Square after it was unveiled. An earlier public sculpture in Old Square is a mural named Old Square sculpted by Kenneth Budd in 1967. The mural was commissioned by the Public Works Department of Birmingham City Council and was paid for from the Capital Account. It was unveiled on 21 April 1967 by Alderman C.V. Simpson, chairman of the Public Works Department. The mural depicts the history of Old Square from the priory onwards.

The area has been settled since the Stone Age. Its history has been affected by its geographical location, on a major estuary on the English Channel coast with an unusual double high-tide, and by its proximity to Winchester and London; the ancient and modern capitals of England. Having been an important regional centre for centuries, Southampton was awarded city status by Queen Elizabeth II in 1964. Southampton became an important port in medieval times, experiencing several hundred years of fluctuating fortunes until it was expanded by the Victorians. As a centre of commerce, an industrial town and an important military embarkation point, Southampton was a strategic target for the Luftwaffe and was severely damaged in World War II. Post-war re-development and the need to accommodate 20th century innovations such as the motor car has significantly altered the character of Southampton.  Prehistoric times  Numerous gravel pits have been dug in the Southampton area, many of which have yielded Stone Age tools.Southampton Museum of Archeology. God's House Tower, Southampton. Evidence of a Stone Age settlement has been found at Priory Avenue, St Denys. Bronze Age objects have been found on Southampton Common, particularly by grave-diggers working in the cemetery and during the construction of the reservoir. Further Bronze Age finds have been made near Cobden Bridge. Iron Age earthworks have been found at Lordswood and Aldermoor and evidence of Iron Age buildings has been found in the City Centre.  Roman occupation (AD 43‚Äì410)  Road map of Roman Britain Antonine Itinerary VII documents the Roman settlement of Clausentum in Roman Britain as being west of Noviomagus Reginorum (Chichester) and from Venta Belgarum (Winchester). In about 1770, John Speed claimed that Clausentum was in the area that is now known as Bitterne Manor.History and Antiquity of Southampton. John Speed. Circa 1770 In 1792, the Rev. Richard Warner investigated those claims and found a ditch, a bank and some Roman coins.Attempt to Ascertain the Situation of the Ancient Clausentum. Rev Richard Warner. 1792 Since then, this site has been investigated further and is generally accepted as the site of Clausentum, but there is no universal agreement. Reference to modern maps show Bitterne Manor to be from Chichester. Wickham is at the junction of two Roman Roads and is a better fit to the distances documented in Antonine Itinerary VII. The case for Clausentum being situated at Bitterne Manor is based on archaeological evidence and the geography of the site (nestled inside a sharp bend in the River Itchen) which clearly allowed it to be turned into a good defensive position. Plaque marking the site of the Roman road on Freemantle Common But the fact that there was a Roman settlement at what is now Bitterne Manor is not disputed. Archaeological finds at what is believed to be Clausentum show the site to be an important trading port with some significant buildings. Traces of a Roman Road on a line running from Bitterne Manor to Wickham have also been found. The Romans abandoned the settlement circa 410, when the Roman occupation of Britain ended.  Anglo Saxon period (400‚Äì1066)  The Anglo- Saxons moved the centre of the town across the River Itchen to what is now the St Mary's area. The settlement was known as Hamwic and or Hamtun, the two names co-existed and described the same area but were used in different contexts. By the middle of the 11th century, the area is described as South Hamtun by Anglo Saxon Chroniclers. References to St Mary's Church also appear in 11th century documents. Hamwic is referred to as a market in the account of the life of St Willibald, written by an Anglo-Saxon nun named Hygeburg in the late 8th century. Excavations have revealed a section of the street plan of Hamwic and uncovered one of the best collections of Saxon artefacts in Europe. These collectively show that Hamwic was a planned town, that it became an important port and traded with the continent and was a Royal administration centre. Hamwic was the site of a mint for several Anglo Saxon Kings (AD 786‚Äì858) until it was moved to Winchester later in the 9th Century.Series H silver pennies were issues in Hamwic in the 8th century AD. They have mostly been found within or close to Hamwic. Hamwic is also believed to have been a point of departure for slaves (being sent to the market at Rouen) and pilgrims, like Willibald to important European cities like Rome.  Vikings (700‚Äì1066)  Viking raids on Southampton disrupted trade with the continent and contributed to the re-organization of Wessex. Important industries that were previously well established in Hamwic were withdrawn further inland to the new fortifications at Winchester, contributing to the decline of Hamwic. Archaeological evidence shows evidence of 10th century settlements and a defended enclosure in what was later to become the Medieval walled town. The Viking King Canute the Great defeated the Anglo-Saxon King Ethelred the Unready in 1014 and was crowned in Southampton. His fabled attempt to \\"command\\" the tide to halt may have taken place in Southampton.  Normans (1066‚Äì1154)  The Parish Church of St Michael Southampton's prosperity was assured following the Norman Conquest in 1066, when it became the major port of transit between Winchester (the capital of England until the early 12th Century) and Normandy. The Domesday Book indicates that Southampton already had distinct French and English quarters at the time of the Norman Conquest and that the King owned a number of properties upon which rent was payable. Archaeological evidence has dated the foundation of St Michael's Church at 1070 and the church was dedicated to St Michael, patron saint of Normandy. An Augustinian priory was founded at St Denys, on of land granted by Henry I, the last of the Norman Kings, in 1127. St Denys Priory continued as a religious house until its suppression in 1536.  Medieval period (1154‚Äì1485)  The medieval city wall Henry II, the first King of the House of Plantagenet, was a regular visitor to Southampton and established Southampton Castle. The Castle was principally used to store the King's wine. Surviving remains of 12th Century merchants houses such as King Johns House and Canutes Palace are evidence of the wealth that existed in the town at this time. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of other houses of similar stature. By the 13th century, Southampton had become a leading port and was particularly involved in the trade of French wine and English wool. The Wool House was built in 1417 as a warehouse for the medieval wool trade with Flanders and Italy. By 1173, the St Mary Magdalen leper Hospital was established to the north of the town. St Julians Hospital, otherwise known as God's House Hospital, was founded around 1196 by Gervase 'le Riche'. The Franciscan friary was later built alongside God's House hospital. Bowls was first played regularly on the green adjacent to God's House Hospital in 1299. The green still exists. It is the world's oldest surviving bowling green. The town was sacked in 1338 by the French. Charles Grimaldi, purchaser of Monaco for the Grimaldi family was involved in the raid and is said to have used the plunder to help found the principality of Monaco but no firm evidence exists to substantiate the claim. After this attack the city's walls, parts of which date from 1175, were extensively improved and reinforced. Lacking proper finance for the construction of a full defensive wall, the solution involved joining the existing exterior walls of existing merchant houses together to form part of the defensive structure. The city walls include God's House Tower, built in 1417, the first purpose-built artillery fortification in England.24 hour museum: God's House Tower Museum of Archaeology, Southampton Accessed 1 August 2007 The walls were finally completed in the 15th century. A large part of the town's walls remain today. Over the years God's House Tower has been used as home to the city's gunner, the Town Gaol and as storage for the Southampton Harbour Board. Until September 2011, it housed the Museum of Archaeology. The Black Death reached England in 1348 via the merchant vessels that regularly visited Southampton at that time. The 12th century Red Lion pub on the High Street below the Bargate within the old walls is where in 1415, immediately prior to King Henry V of England's departure from Southampton to the Battle of Agincourt, the ringleaders of the 'Southampton Plot', Richard, Earl of Cambridge, Henry Scrope, 3rd Baron Scrope of Masham and Sir Thomas Grey of Heton, were tried and found guilty of high treason, before being summarily executed outside the Bargate. During the Middle Ages, shipbuilding became an increasingly important industry and was to remain so for centuries to come. The city became a county corporate in 1447.  Tudor period (1485‚Äì1603)  John Speed's 1612 map of Southampton Southampton's Tudor House otherwise known as Huttofts or Lady Ann Guidotti's House was built in 1495 for Sir John Dawtry. It has formerly been a family home, an artist's studio and housed businesses including a dye-house and a bookbinder. It is now a museum. Tudor House Museum , Southampton City Council, retrieved 6 December 2011 Southampton's economic fortunes fluctuated during the Tudor period From 1492 to 1531, all exports of tin and lead were required to pass through Southampton. Trade with the Channel Islands increased. In 1554 Southampton was granted a monopoly on the export of wool to the Mediterranean and on the import of sweet wine. At other times during this period, the port was in decline, mainly because trade was shifting to London.Southampton was also a convenient port for the buccaneers that plundered Spanish ships in the English Channel and the Atlantic Ocean. The development of Hurst, Calshot, Cowes and Netley castles along Southampton Water and the Solent, by Henry VIII in about 1540, meant that Southampton was no longer so dependent upon its fortifications. In 1553, the Free Grammar School off the Mayor Baliffs and Burgesses of the Towne and County of Southampton was granted letters patent by Edward VI, establishing the new school and thus fulfilling the legacy of William Capon who left money for that purpose in his will. The schools survives as King Edward VI School, Southampton.  Stuart period (1603‚Äì1714)  The Pilgrim Memorial, Town Quay The port was the original point of departure for the Pilgrim Fathers aboard the Mayflower in 1620. A memorial can be found on Town Quay. Since that time it has been the last port of call for millions of emigrants who left the Old World to start a new life in the USA, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Barbados and other parts of the world. In 1642, during the English Civil War, a Parliamentary garrison moved into Southampton, initially to defend against seaborne attack from Royalist ships. A Royalist army advanced as far as Redbridge in March 1644 but were prevented from taking the town by Colonel Richard Norton. The Battle of Cheriton, also in March 1644, subsequently removed the threat to Southampton. In June 1664, the Black Death returned to Southampton. This new plague seriously disrupted life and led the Corporation to report that it was unable to continue governing the town. By the time the epidemic ended in November 1666, 1700 people had died. Isaac Watts the younger, born in Southampton in 1674, wrote the words of the hymn \\"O God Our Help in Ages Past\\". His early education was at the Free Grammar School. He was a member of the Above Bar Independent Community. This non-conformist community was persecuted following the Act of Uniformity of 1662. Isaac Watts' father, also named Isaac, suffered periods of imprisonment in the Bargate. In 1689 the right to vote in parliamentary elections, which had previously been limited to freemen, was extended to include those paying Scot and lot.  Georgian era (1714‚Äì1795)  = Spa town = Southampton became a spa town in 1740, thanks to the discovery of a spring of chalybeate water. The area was laid out as Spa gardens and earned royal patronage. That further encouraged fashionable society to Southampton and aided its prosperity and development. Southampton had also become a popular site for sea bathing by the 1760s, despite the lack of a good quality beach. Innovative buildings specifically for this purpose were built at West Quay, with baths that were filled and emptied by the flow of the tide, one of which had an adjustable floor. The building, known as the Long Rooms, had a long promenade with views over the water to be enjoyed by spectators and bathers alike. = Polygon = The Polygon was an 18th-century residential and commercial development designed in 1768 by James Leroux which was aimed at Southampton's fashionable clientele. It was intended to be a development of 12 residential houses, with a hotel, shops, an assembly room and an ornamental lake. Three houses and the hotel were completed by 1773, but the scheme had financial problems and it was never completed. The buildings have since been demolished. = Coaching = The fashionable attractions of the town caused coaching traffic to increase. Several coaching inns were established in Southampton, including the Dolphin Hotel and the Star Hotel, and there was a great deal of competition for passengers and guests. The coaching trade continued until it was rendered obsolete by the arrival of the railway. = Canals = There was a great deal of interest in constructing canals, though this was only partially implemented. In 1774, a canal between Eling and Salisbury was proposed, but it was not built. In 1779, a canal linking Southampton (at Redbridge) to Andover was proposed. The Redbridge to Andover canal was completed in 1796. In 1792, the proposal to link Southampton and Salisbury by canal gained new momentum. The plan was to build a new canal from Salisbury to connect with the Andover to Southampton canal at Kimbridge. The canal would then be extended from Redbridge into the centre of Southampton, passing through a tunnel under the Marlands, branching at Houndwell to serve both Northam and Town Quay. The tunnel was started but was never completed. = Industrial Revolution = Walter Taylor's 18th century mechanisation of the block-making process, in Southampton, was a significant step in the Industrial Revolution, winning him a monopoly on the supply of wooden rigging blocks for the Royal Navy from 1759 to 1803.  Regency period (1795‚Äì1837)  For centuries, the only crossings of the river Itchen in this area were at Mansbridge, some distance upstream from Southampton, and at Itchen Ferry village. The Northam Bridge Company was formed in 1796. They built a toll bridge at Northam which was opened in September 1799 and new roads connecting the bridge to Southampton and Botley, Hampshire. The town was further connected to Portsmouth via another toll bridge built at Bursledon and another road which linked Bursledon bridge to the new Northam to Botley road at Bitterne. The Floating Bridge also connected Southampton to Woolston and Portsmouth on the east bank of the River Itchen in 1836. Southampton was one of the boroughs reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, and contained the parishes of All Saints, Holy Rood, St John, St Lawrence, St Mary, St Michael, and part of South Stoneham. The painter John Everett Millais was born in the city in 1829. Southampton Solent University's art gallery is named Millais Gallery in his honour. ‚Äì Retrieved 8 April 2004 Victorian era (1837‚Äì1901) Southampton High Street in 1839. There was competition between the two toll companies at Northam and Itchen,The Changing Face of Hedge End. Joyce B Blyth resulting in another new road on the east of the Itchen, connecting Woolston to Botley via Sholing and Hedge End. The town experienced major expansion during the Victorian era. The Southampton Docks company was formed in 1835. In October 1838, the foundation stone of the docks was laid. The first dock opened on 29 August 1842. The Royal Mail Steam Packet Company operated its services from Southampton, officially designating the port as the packet station in May 1843. The structural and economic development of the docks continued for the next few decades. The London and Southampton Railway was fully opened to in May 1840, although it had been operating as far as since June 1839, It was delayed by work on the chalk cutting between Winchester and . In 1847, Southampton was connected to by the Southampton and Dorchester Railway. In 1866, a branch line extended the railway over the River Itchen at , passing through and to . This created further competition for the Floating Bridge company. With good transport links, Southampton became the emigrant station for North America and Canada in January 1844. The Southampton Emigration and Shipping Company was formed in 1846 Southampton subsequently became known as The Gateway to the Empire, with many emigrants passing through Southampton to start a new life in the United States and Canada, South Africa and Australia. The town became a county borough under the Local Government Act 1888. In 1894, under the Local Government Act 1894, the part of South Stoneham, within the borough, became the parish of Portswood, in 1895 the parish of Shirley was added. Cholera epidemics in 1848‚Äì49 and 1865 caused great concern. These outbreaks were centred on the slums of the old medieval town. Sewers were built in the 1840s and 1870s. In 1894, the Borough Medical Officer of Health published a report on poverty in the town. Population density in the slums at that time was recorded as . The Simnel Street and West Quay Improvement plan subsequently cleared the area of slums, created new streets and a lodging house in St Michaels Square; it was called St Michaels House and opened in 1899.  Edwardian period (1901‚Äì1914)  = The Titanic disaster = In common with most of the luxury liners of the time, sailed from Southampton. Most of the crew came from Southampton; 549 Sotonians died in the sinking. The Maritime museum in the old Wool House included an exhibition related to the vessel but this has since been moved and incorporated into SeaCity Museum.  World War I (1914‚Äì1918)  Southampton was designated No. 1 Military Embarkation Port in August 1914. Much of Southampton Common was taken over by the military A total of 8,149,685 troops and their equipment departed for mainland Europe through the port. A steady flow of refugees, prisoners of war and 1,177,125 wounded came back to England through Southampton.  Interwar period (1918‚Äì1939)  In 1919, soldiers returning from World War I mutinied in the port. In 1920, Bitterne Parish Council and Itchen Urban District Council, which collectively covered the districts of Bitterne, Bitterne Manor, Bitterne Park, Woolston, Peartree Green, Sholing and Weston, were incorporated into the borough of Southampton. Bassett and Swaythling were incorporated into Southampton at the same time. The period between the two World Wars saw an increase in the volume of traffic, as the motor car and Southampton Corporation Tramways evolved. It became essential to develop new routes around the Bargate as the central arch was too much of an obstruction. By 1931, a tram passed through the Bargate every 30 seconds and over the course of 14 hours, 2000 cars and 6000 bicycles would use the same narrow passage between Above Bar and the High Street. The photographs (below) illustrate the problem. Several old buildings and part of the medieval walls were demolished on both sides of the Bargate. In 1932, the Bargate was bypassed on its eastern side. The Bargate became an island when it was bypassed on its western side in 1938. The Clock Tower, further up Above Bar at the junction with New Road, was relocated to Bitterne Park Triangle in 1934 to facilitate further road improvements. Image:AboveBar1926.jpgAbove Bar, 1926 Image:HighStreetSouthamptoncirca1930.jpgHigh Street, circa 1930 Image:HighStreetGaietycirca1930.jpgHigh Street, circa 1930, showing the Gaiety cinema On 26 March 1929, Southampton Corporation purchased Northam Bridge from the Northam Bridge Company. On 16 May 1929, the tolls on that bridge were removed. At the same time, the tolls at Lances Hill, Hedge End and the bridge at Bursledon were also abolished. The only remaining toll in Southampton was at the Floating Bridge, which was eventually taken over by Southampton Corporation in 1934, remaining a toll-crossing until it closed in 1977.  World War II (1939‚Äì1945)  = Air raids = An air raid drill in February 1940 The Second World War hit Southampton particularly hard. Pockets of Georgian architecture remain, but much of the city was levelled during the Blitz of November 1940. 476 tons of bombs were dropped on the city by the Luftwaffe. Southampton was a prime target because of its general strategic importance as a major port and industrial area, and particularly because the Supermarine Spitfire was designed, developed and built in Southampton. On 15 September 1940, the Supermarine factory in Woolston was bombed, killing many, though not damaging the factory. Two days later, the factory was destroyed. After the air raid Nazi propaganda declared that the town had been left a smoking ruin. On 6 November 1940, during a raid on the town centre, three bombs hit the School of Art in the Civic Centre, (now known as the Art Gallery), killing students that were sheltering in the basement. The main blitz, a series of sustained nighttime raids, started on 23 November 1940. There was a pause until 30 November, when the resumption of raids destroyed repairs that had made during the lull. The blitz continued on 1 December, but these raids were sporadic and smaller. A total of 137 people died during the period of the Blitz, of which 96 were lost to direct hits on public air raid shelters. The accuracy of the locally based Ordnance Survey's maps did not go unrecognised by the Luftwaffe: German bomber pilots used them to bomb Southampton. One building that survived the bombing was Southampton's oldest, St Michaels Church. The spire was an important navigational aid for the German pilots and consequently they were ordered to avoid hitting it. Other buildings in Southampton were found to be used as aids to navigation; Elmfield flats in Millbrook had a flat concrete roof which was clearly visible from the air until it was grassed over. There were 1,605 air raid warnings in Southampton, the last raid occurred on 5 November 1944. Only one flying bomb fell within the boundaries of Southampton, at Sholing on 12 July 1944. = D-Day and the Invasion of Europe = In July 1943, military exercise Harlequin tested the ports' capacity for embarking troops and equipment. Original estimates were that 11,000 troops could be embarked on each high tide. The exercise showed that 44,000 troops could be handled. By D-Day, that figure had increased to 53,750 troops and 7070 vehicles, aided by the construction of additional facilities specifically with D-Day in mind. Besides the embarkation of troops, Southampton was used for other purposes in the preparations for the Invasion of Europe. US servicemen and Lend Lease imports arrived at the docks. Sections of Mulberry Harbour were constructed in the harbour. A planning team for the Operation Pluto pipelines that provided fuel to the Normandy sector was based at . Southampton was at the heart of Area C, a huge marshalling area in southern Hampshire, which extended as far north as Winchester. Detailed maps of the time show that within Area C, Sub-area Z extended around the north of Southampton and as far as Hedge End in the east. There were military camps on the common, Harefield, Thornhill, and Netley Common. The maps even show that there were Chemical Warfare dumps to the north of the town.The town centre, the docks, Woolston and Weston were part of Embarkation Area C5. The plan was that troops and equipment would be assembled in the camps in sub-areas W, X, Y and Z then brought to the embarkation area to be loaded aboard the ships that were waiting there. That plan was tested in May 1944, during Operation Fabius, with troops that passed through Southampton rehearsing their landings at Hayling Island, Bracklesham Bay and Littlehampton After D-Day Southampton continued to work at full capacity to re-supply the Allied Forces on mainland Europe. From 1 April to 25 August 1944, Southampton was within Regulated Area (No 2), which placed the local population under certain restrictions that were intended to secure the military operation.  Post-war (1945‚Äì2000)  A road map of Southampton from 1948 Ordnance Survey map of Southampton urban area 1961. Squares are appx 1km The Second World War had a profound impact on the city due to the destruction of a lot of the city's buildings, leading to a massive regeneration program. These buildings were cheaply constructed in order to rebuild quickly, having a negative effect on the architectural quality in the city. Southampton was awarded city status in 1964 by Letters Patent.City Status for Southampton. The Times. 12 February 1964. In 1967, Southampton took in part of the Nursling and Rownhams parishes. The boundaries have been largely unchanged since. Southampton lost its County Borough status under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming a non-metropolitan district. It became a Unitary Authority in 1997, administratively independent of Hampshire County Council, following the Banham Review. On 29 April 1952, the Hartley University College was granted a Royal Charter to give the University of Southampton full university status. The university's Southampton School of Medicine was opened in 1971.  21st century (2001‚Äìpresent)  Southampton is still an important ocean liner port, frequented by luxury ships such as P&O;'s , and Cunard Line's , and . It is the busiest cruise-ship terminal in the UK and handles the most vehicle imports into the country. In 2012, a century after the RMS Titanic disaster, the city council opened the SeaCity Museum. In the 2010s several developments to the inner city of Southampton were completed. In 2016 the south section of West Quay, or West Quay South, originally known as West Quay Watermark, was opened to the public. Its public plaza has been used for several annual events, such as an ice skating rink during the winter season, and a public broadcast of the Wimbledon tennis championship. The response to the architecture of the building was positive as it received two awards from the Prix Versailles ceremony, winning \\"Best Shopping Centre Worldwide\\" and \\"best European Shopping Centre Design\\". Two new buildings, the John Hansard Gallery with City Eye and a secondary site for the University of Southampton's Nuffield Theatre, in addition to several flats, have been built in the \\"cultural quarter\\" adjacent to Guildhall Square in 2017. The buildings had been developing for over a decade due to different architects and investors being involved and then leaving the project. The first exhibition was from German artist Gerhard Richter. In 2019 the retail and accommodation-based \\"Bargate quarter\\" redevelopment, replacing the demolished Bargate shopping centre, and enabling public access to the previously hidden sections of the city walls, will be opened. Due to the investment in these areas of business and culture, and the development of several start-up businesses, PricewaterhouseCoopers and Demos ranked the city third \\"best city\\" in their Good Growth for Cities report. In November 2017 the council selected an official flag for the city through a competition to design one and then a vote on the most popular design. Several annual events occur within the city. Fun runs have become a popular occurrence within the city: The park run which began in 2004 The Southampton Marathon which has run for many years and attracts 40,000 runners. and the MoRun, a charity run, beginning in 2018. The mass cycling event \\"Let's Ride\\", previously known as \\"Sky Ride\\", attracts thousands of cyclists for a route. Since 2008 the council has run the \\"Music In the City\\" event in which hundreds of musicians perform in venues and on constructed stages around the city centre. Common People, a 2 date festival run by the organisers of the Dorset-based Bestival, has run in the Southampton Common since 2015. Southampton's pride parade began in 2017, having up to 15,000 participants in 2018. Several public demonstrations occurred within the city in \\"solidarity\\" with larger national demonstrations. As part of nationwide 2017 Women's March, taking place in line with the inauguration of Donald Trump as president of the United States a half hour public reading was organised in the city. Similarly in June 2018 an anti- austerity rally occurred simultaneously with the major demonstration in London. There was also a protest against Donald Trump's state visit to the United Kingdom in July that same year.  Memorials  The Cenotaph, West (Watts) Park RMS Titanic. = The Cenotaph = The city is home to Sir Edwin Lutyens' first permanent cenotaph, which was the basis for his design of the cenotaph memorial in Whitehall, London, a memorial to the city's dead of World War I. When it was unveiled on 6 November 1920, it had 1,800 names, later 2,008 names. It can be found in Watts (West) Park, opposite the Titanic engineers memorial. = Titanic = A memorial to the engineers of the RMS Titanic may be found in Andrews (East) Park, on Above Bar Street. There is a memorial to the musicians who played on the Titanic on the corner of Above Bar St and Cumberland place. = Isaac Watts = The Watts memorial in the city's West Park, also known as the Watts Park, was unveiled in 1861. The melody of his famous Hymn, \\"O God our help in Ages Past\\" can be heard when the Civic Centre clock chimes.  Places of Worship (past and present)  = Holyrood = Holyrood Church was one of the original five churches serving the walled town. Built in 1320, the church was destroyed by enemy bombing during the blitz in November 1940. In 1957 the shell of the church was dedicated as a memorial to the sailors of the Merchant Navy. In 2004, it received funding from the Heritage Lottery Fund and the Merchant Navy Association to make the remaining structure more stable and usable. = St Michael's Church = Construction of St Michael's Church is thought to have been commenced in 1070; the building has been added to many times over the centuries, but its central tower dates from Norman times. = St Mary's Church = St Mary's Church is the largest church in the city and can trace its origins to the first Saxon settlements of the 7th century.  Aviation history  = Supermarine = The Spitfire was developed and initially manufactured in the suburb of Woolston. Its designer, Reginald Mitchell, grew up in Stoke-on-Trent, then had a house in Russell Place in Highfield suburb near the university (now identified by a memorial plaque). The plane was a direct descendant of experimental aircraft built by Supermarine that competed in the Schneider Trophy in the 1930s. Supermarine was taken over by Vickers in 1928. Mitchell's short life is documented in the film The First of the Few. = Other = There were many aircraft companies based around Hamble, to the east of the town, from the 1930s to the 1950s, including Folland Aviation, started by Henry P. Folland, the former chief designer of Gloster Aircraft. Folland was taken over by Hawker Siddeley in 1960, and later became British Aerospace, the factory built the Gnat, Hawk and Harrier. The history of the area's contribution to aviation is celebrated at Solent Sky (formerly Southampton Hall of Aviation), near Itchen Bridge, and opposite the erstwhile site of the Woolston Supermarine factory. BOAC had a flying boat base in the docks serving British colonial possessions in Africa and Asia in the 1930s and 1940s. Aquila Airways then used Berth 50 until they ended operations in late 1958. Nearby, Calshot Spit was a base for military flying boat operations and servicing.  Shipbuilding history  = Vosper Thornycroft = The John I. Thornycroft & Company shipyard was the major employer in Woolston from 1904 to 2004. The yard built and repaired many ships for the Royal Navy and was particularly busy during the two World Wars. John I. Thornycroft & Company merged with Vosper & Co. in 1966 to become Vosper Thornycroft. Subsequently renamed VT Group, the yard closed in 2004 when the business relocated to Portsmouth. = Day, Summers & Co. = The Day Summers & Co. shipyard at Northam, originally the Northam Iron works launched its first iron steam ship in October 1840 and proceeded to build mail ships for expanding services that operated from Southampton's newly developed docks. Subsequently, the firm built a number of specialized vessels, including a submarine Incognita and luxury steam yachts. During World War I, the yard built tugs, minesweepers and refrigerated barges. The yard closed in January 1929, its last project being the Floating Bridge, launched in 1928.  Transport history  = Floating Bridge = The Floating Bridge in June 1977 The Floating Bridge was opened in 1836 and connected Southampton to Woolston At that time Woolston was a separate village on the east bank of the River Itchen, it did not become part of Southampton until 1920. Originally owned by a private company, the Floating Bridge was purchased by Southampton Corporation in 1934. This service continued until 1977 when the Itchen Bridge was opened. = Trams = Southampton Corporation tram decorated for the Duke of York's visit to Southampton in July 1930 Horse-drawn trams appeared in Southampton in 1879. Electrified trams were introduced in 1900. From 1908, Southampton Corporation built most of its own trams at its works in Portswood. In 1923, some specially designed trams were introduced. These had unique rounded roofs which allowed them to pass through the centre arch of the Bargate. During WorldWarII, Southamptons Trams were parked overnight in sidings on the Common instead of in the terminus buildings located around the city. From 1942 they were painted battleship grey. Because of those precautions, only one tram was lost to enemy bombing. The Tram system did not extend very far into the Eastern part of the City, passing over the River Itchen and Cobden Bridge and connecting with Bitterne Railway Station. Suburbs that were newly incorporated into the town in 1920 were always served by buses instead of trams. Southampton's trams were gradually taken out of service during 1948 and 1949, with the final tram running on 31 December 1949. 1954 Guy Arab in Southampton Corporation Livery = Buses = Southamptons trams were superseded by a fleet of diesel engined buses, though buses had previously been in service in some parts of the City which were not serviced by trams. Some surviving buses dating back to the 1949 are looked after by Southampton & District Transport Heritage Trust. = Railways = The railway arrived in Southampton in 1839 The first permanent station was Southampton Terminus situated near Canute Road. Originally, trains terminated at a temporary structure at Northam. In 1847, Southampton Terminus was linked to Dorchester via the Southampton and Dorchester Railway and in 1866 it was extended to an additional line that served Netley and later Netley Hospital. On 2 September 1889, an extension to Fareham was opened and it became what is now the Southampton to Fareham Line. The Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway was originally intended to run on a separate competing route from Winchester to a new station north of the Royal Pier. Deposited plans show the route entering the town from Winchester via a tunnel in Chilworth near the current Chilworth Arms Public house before passing through Lordswood and running down the east side of Dale Valley. From here it was to pass under Winchester Road, running to the east of the current St James' Park, Southampton through land now occupied by Shirley Junior School, then run south east close to the current Wilton Road to cross to the east of Hill Lane near Archers Road.Deposited Plans Hampshire Record Office Collection DP/384/1 Didcot Newbury and Southampton Junction Railway: deposited plan 1881 Construction of an embankment and viaduct commenced to the East of Hill Lane before the scheme was abandoned. The Dell was subsequently built on part of the cleared land between Archers Road and Milton Road and the unused embankment remains behind properties to the East of Hill Lane between Milton Road and Commercial Road. Ultimately the line was connected to the existing London and South Western Railway route at Shawford Junction South of Winchester in 1891, and a separate line into Southampton was never built. In 1892, the London and South Western Railway Company purchased Southampton Docks. By 1897, the existing Southampton Terminus, the South Western Hotel, a large goods yard and a turntable had all been established, with railway lines running across Canute Road and into every corner of the docks. The interaction between trains and other traffic was controlled by men with red flags. This close relationship between the docks and the railways allowed specialist Boat Train services to be developed that connected with the transatlantic liners, trains ultimately terminating at full-length platforms housed within the Ocean Terminal. Trains also ran directly on to the Royal Pier to connect with ferry services to Portsmouth, Ryde and Cowes. The nearby Cattle Market was also well served by the railway. The decline of transatlantic passenger liners in favour of quicker air routes, the development of Southampton Container Terminal, which transferred dock traffic to Millbrook and the electrification of the South Western Main Line to London, all affected the economics of Southampton Terminus. Passenger services ceased on 9 September 1966 but the terminus continued to be used for parcels until March 1968. Southampton Central, originally Southampton West, is now the main railway station for Southampton. Football Club Southampton is home to Southampton F.C. the professional football club formed in 1885 with its origins in the football team of the St Mary's Church Young Men's Association. Since moving from its former ground 'The Dell' in 2001, the club is now based at St Mary's Stadium close to its original home. It also has a training and development centre at Staplewood, near Marchwood, on the edge of the New Forest. Southampton FC spent very many years competing in the lower divisions of the Football League but since 1966 it has generally competed in the higher levels of professional football. The club's principal prize was its FA Cup win over Manchester United in 1976. The club was one of the founding members of the Premiership in 1992‚Äì93. The club was out of the top flight of football from 2005 until 2012 during which time the company owning the club went into administration but its fortunes were revived following purchase by the Swiss billionaire, Markus Liebherr, and since 2012-13 the club has competed in the Premier League.

Rich Walker also used to run The Miskatonic Foundation, a record label dedicated to doom metal and traditional heavy metal. It has now since dissolved due to lack of time. History The band released their debut album Lamentations on England's Candlelight Records in 1994 and caught the attention of an underground scene that was at that point swept up with the still new second wave of black metal. Successive UK and European tours, with Count Raven and Anathema respectively, firmly cemented the band as something of a cult act across the continent. 1996 saw the release of the Halcyon EP on Black Tears, comfortably conveying the strength and progression of that line- up, while further embracing their English Heavy Metal roots but with an aesthetic that shows the band were not afraid to court a more sinister undercurrent. Shortly after, however, Solstice once again suffered line-up problems that essentially resulted in the band becoming largely dormant. In 1998, the band signed with Misanthropy Records, which helped with the release of New Dark Age, but the band was painfully laid to rest in 2002. In 2007, Solstice was re-ignited. after a five-year hiatus, Walker commented that he was inspired to continue Solstice after enlisting the services of Andrew Whittaker from The Lamp Of Thoth.The recruitment of Paul Bwitton on vocals and Richard Horton on drums (both formerly of NWOBHM outfit Scarab) proved fruitless, but undeterred the band had Procession singer Felipe temporarily fill the vocalist position in order to honour live commitments. Buoyed by this success, Solstice set about recruiting a full-time vocalist with whom they could move forward and so in the Summer of 2011 they welcomed Paul Thomas Kearns into the lineup. An Irishman living in Oslo, Kearns had appeared on one album with disbanded Irish Doom/Death Metal band Arcane Sun. The new line-up of Solstice made their live debut supporting Primordial in the latter's 20 years anniversary show at Dublin's Academy on 24 September 2011. Del Nichol replaced Richard Horton on drums later in 2011 and was also replaced nine months later by Deceptor's drummer James Ashbey. Solstice ended their 12-year absence from the recording studio in early 2013 with the release of their Mini LP Death's Crown is Victory, issued on their own \\"White Horse\\" imprint. They promoted this release by touring across Europe. In late 2019, Hel Thorne, alternately regarded as Hagthorn, was revealed as the new vocalist of Solstice, having replaced Paul Thomas Kearns. To commemorate her joining the band, Solstice released a two-song EP called White Thane, which consisted of two songs from their 2018 album White Horse Hill reworked with Hagthorn on vocals. Hagthorn's previous musical experience includes being the vocalist for Vermont-based doom metal band Chalice.

A late work, probably composed or assembled around 1510, it was the most popular of his masses in the 16th century.Noble, Grove The Missa de Beata Virgine is unusual among Josquin's masses in that the first two movements are for four voices, and the last three for five, with the fifth voice derived canonically. Like most musical settings of the mass Ordinary, it is in five sections, or movements: # Kyrie # Gloria # Credo # Sanctus # Agnus Dei It uses different plainsong chants for each movement, and is a paraphrase mass, one in which the original chants are elaborated, broken up, passed between voices, or sung in different voices simultaneously. The mass is one of only four that Josquin based on plainsong, and probably the second to last (the others are the Missa Gaudeamus, a relatively early work, the Missa Ave maris stella, and the Missa Pange lingua; all of them involve, in some way, glorification of the Virgin Mary).Planchart, p. 91 All of the chants in the Missa de Beata Virgine are in praise of the Virgin Mary, and the whole is a Lady Mass, the Votive Mass for Saturday, a type that was popular around 1500.Planchart, p. 120 Since music for two of the movements ‚Äì the Gloria and Credo ‚Äì appeared independently in Vatican sources, circulating in 1503 or before, it has been presumed that the mass was assembled later from several parts, and most likely the five- voice portions were composed around 1510. The first appearance of the whole mass was in Ottaviano Petrucci's 1514 book of Josquin's masses, his third such set; it has even been speculated that Petrucci himself may have put it together from an existing performance tradition.Planchart, p. 121 Most likely Josquin took the Gloria and Credo which he had already written, and then wrote a Kyrie to conform to the Gloria, and added a Sanctus and Agnus to go with the Credo, since the work's modal coherence suggests that he conceived at least the first two movements, and then the last three movements together. The Missa de Beata Virgine was one of Josquin's last three masses, with the others being the Missa Sine nomine and the Missa Pange lingua. It was probably the earliest of the three, and Missa Pange lingua the last. Distinguishing the last masses, and his late style period in general, was a general simplification and refinement: Josquin left behind the elaborate contrapuntal artifice evident in the masses of the preceding period, such as the two he wrote on the L'homme arm√© tune, and wrote music in which bringing out the meaning of the text, and having it understood, was more important than any virtuoso display. The movements differ in their treatment of the source plainchant. The Kyrie has the chant in all voices, imitatively and paraphrased; the Gloria treats the chant as a cantus firmus, migrating it from voice to voice. Tonally, both movements end on G, and most of their cadences are on G or D. The Credo, the first movement for five voices, ends with a surprising Phrygian cadence on E, and uses canonic techniques more prominently than in the preceding movements. The overall sound is darker and reminiscent of Johannes Ockeghem.Planchart, p.124-125 The Sanctus is unusual among Josquin's mass movements, for the five voices sing throughout without a break: normally Josquin breaks up the texture with passages in reduced scoring. Yet the texture is light, with the voices singing polyphonically only some of the time. In the closing Agnus, the chant is treated freely, and the texture is similar to that which Josquin used in his chansons. Both the Agnus and Sanctus cadence on C.Planchart, p. 129-130 The popularity of this mass in the 16th century may be due to its \\"sensuously appealing\\" surface texture, one which foreshadows the music of later composers such as Crist√≥bal Morales and Nicolas Gombert.Planchart, p. 130 References * Jeremy Noble: \\"Josquin des Prez\\", 12, Grove Music Online, ed.

India presently does not observe daylight saving time (DST or summer time). The official time signal is given by the Time and Frequency Standards Laboratory. The IANA time zone database contains only one zone pertaining to India, namely Asia/Kolkata. The date and time notation in India shows some peculiarities.  Background  = History = Ancient India Hindu units of time‚Äîlargely of mythological and ritual importance‚Äîdisplayed on a logarithmic scale. One of the earliest known descriptions of standard time in India appeared in the 4th century CE astronomical treatise Surya Siddhanta. Postulating a spherical earth, the book described the thousands years old customs of the prime meridian, or zero longitude, as passing through Avanti, the ancient name for the historic city of Ujjain, and Rohitaka, the ancient name for Rohtak (), a city near the Kurukshetra. The day used by ancient Indian astronomers began at sunrise at the prime meridian of Ujjain, and was divided into smaller time units in the following manner: > Time that is measurable is that which is in common use, beginning with the > prƒÅ·πáa (or, the time span of one breath). The pala contains six prƒÅ·πáas. The > ghalikƒÅ is 60 palas, and the nak·π£atra ah√≥rƒÅtra, or astronomical day, > contains 60 ghalikƒÅs. A nak·π£atra mƒÅsa, or astronomical month, consists of 30 > days. Taking a day to be 24 hours, the smallest time unit, prƒÅ·πáa, or one respiratory cycle, equals 4 seconds, a value consistent with the normal breathing frequency of 15 breaths/min used in modern medical research.Piepoli, M. 1997. \\"Origin of Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia in Conscious Humans.\\" Circulation. 95:1813‚Äì1821. Retrieved 1 December 2006. The Surya Siddhanta also described a method of converting local time to the standard time of Ujjain. Despite these early advances, standard time was not widely used outside astronomy. For most of India's history, ruling kingdoms kept their own local time, typically using the Hindu calendar in both lunar and solar units. For example, the Jantar Mantar observatory built by Maharaja Sawai Jai Singh in Jaipur in 1733 contains large sundials, up to 90 ft (27 m) high, which were used to accurately determine the local time. During British colonial rule  In 1802 Madras Time was set up by John Goldingham and this was later used widely by the railways in India. Local time zones were also set up in the important cities of Bombay and Calcutta and as Madras time was intermediate to these, it was one of the early contenders for an Indian standard time zone. Though British India did not officially adopt the standard time zones until 1905, when the meridian passing east of Allahabad at 82.5¬∞ E longitude was picked as the central meridian for India, corresponding to a single time zone for the country (UTC+05:30). Indian Standard Time came into force on 1 January 1906, and also applied to Sri Lanka (then Ceylon). However, Calcutta Time was officially maintained as a separate time zone until 1948 and Bombay Time until 1955. In 1925, time synchronisation began to be relayed through omnibus telephone systems and control circuits to organisations that needed to know the precise time. This continued until the 1940s, when time signals began to be broadcast using the radio by the government. Briefly during World War II, clocks under Indian Standard Time were advanced by one hour, referred to as War Time. This provision lasted from September 1, 1942 to October 15, 1945.http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/timezone.html?n=54&syear;=1925 After independence After independence in 1947, the Indian government established IST as the official time for the whole country, although Mumbai and Kolkata retained their own local time for a few more years.

Of course, the ultimate goal in 2007 was to make it back to the ArenaCup Championship Game. Off-season The 2006-2007 off season saw several members of the 2006 team get signed by AFL teams. Between seasons Head Coach Fred Siegfried accepted the offensive coordinator position for the AFL's Kansas City Brigade. Regular season =Week 1: vs. Stockton Lightning= at Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena, Spokane, Washington In front of another sold out crowd, 10,653 fans watched the defending 2006 ArenaCup Champions take to the field on Saturday, March 31, 2007 for their season opener. The season started off just as it did in the 2006 season; a home game against the Stockton Lightning. The game started with a Shock touchdown on a fumble return as the Lightning fumbled the opening kickoff. Three receivers (Antwone Savage, Chico Mackey, and Raul Vijil) had multiple catches combining for 162 yards and 18 receptions. Shock Quarterback Andrico Hines was honored as the Offensive Player of the Game after passing for three touchdowns and 168 yards with only one interception. On the defensive side of things, the Shock made a statement by producing three key turnovers (3 fumbles and 2 interceptions (both by Rob Keefe). The defense also made a goal-line stand in the 3rd quarter. The Shock stuffed the Lighting and prevented a touchdown after Stockton made four straight goal-line attempts from the 1 yard-line. The Shock won the game 51-35. =Week 2: vs. Quad City Steamwheelers= at Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena, Spokane, Washington Looking to go 2-0, the Shock took to the field against the Quad City Steamwheelers on April 6, 2007 in front of yet another sold out crowd of 10,560 fans. The game started off slow for both teams due to sloppy play and numerous penalties on both teams. Only 13 total points were scored during the first quarter. The game was earmarked the game of the week in the af2 because in the coaches' poll, the Shock were ranked 2nd, and the Steamwheelers were ranked 3rd. The rankings didn't lie, as both teams were neck and neck in scoring for three quarters when the Steamwheelers pulled away in the 4th by scoring 27 points, as opposed to the Shock's 18. Statistically, the Shock played the better game, and would have won, but Quad City capitalized on the Shock's four interceptions, two of them being end zone interceptions. Because of that, Coach Adam Shackleford benched starting quarterback Andrico Hines in the 4th quarter and put in backup quarterback Matt Gutierrez. For only the second time in franchise history, the Shock lost a home game, with the Steamwheelers beating them 60-45. =Week 3: at Fort Wayne Fusion= at Allen County War Memorial Coliseum, Fort Wayne, Indiana Rebounding from a dismal performance the last week, quarterback Andrico Hines threw for 5 touchdowns and 0 interceptions. The final minute of the game saw four touchdowns scored in total. With one second left on the clock, the Spokane Shock had an opportunity to tie the game, but Hines threw and incomplete pass off the net. The result was a loss, and the first time in franchise history that the team lost two straight games. =Week 4: vs. Lubbock Renegades= at Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena, Spokane, Washington Looking to rebound from an unprecedented two straight losses, the Spokane Shock put on a show. QB Andrico Hines threw six touchdowns (17-31, 192 yards) without throwing an interception for the second consecutive week. The Renegades defense focused on WR Antwone Savage who was limited to only six receptions (his lowest total of the season) but still managed to haul in four touchdowns and 75 yards. As a result, Hines had to turn to receiver Andre Rector, who continued to improve from Week 3, The Shock's other receiver, Raul Vijil, had two touchdown receptions but left the game in the third quarter after spraining his ankle. The Spokane defense also put on a show. The Shock had several huge stops, which limited the Renegades to just 26 points. The secondary made outstanding contributions. In addition to the 5 pass breakups from Nygel Rogers and Alex Teems, the defense forced two turnovers (both interceptions by Rob Keefe, one being returned 13 yards for a touchdown) and made 26 tackles. This contrasted the previous week, in which the Shock allowed the Fusion to score 63 points, and they had 32 missed tackles. =Week 5: @ Stockton Lightning= at Stockton Arena, Stockton, California The Spokane Shock used a blocked field goal as time expired in regulation to avert a last-second comeback by the Stockton Lightning, and got their first road win of the season. Spokane QB Andrico Hines completed 22-of-33 passes for 244 yards and three touchdowns. Spokane and Stockton traded touchdowns in the first quarter and were tied at 7-7 going into the second quarter. The second quarter proved no different for either team as the two teams were tied at 27 a piece going into half time after a 1-yard rush by Katon Bethay with no time remaining in the 2nd quarter. During the third quarter, the Lightning took the lead for a brief time. Stockton was ahead by a touchdown while the Shock scored a field goal, and then scored another touchdown to retake the lead by 3. The Lightning would never retake the lead for the rest of the game. On the final play of the game, Lightning kicker Alex Walls then lined up a 47-yard field goal attempt to tie the game which was deflected by two Spokane defenders, ending the game. =Week 6: BYE WEEK= The Spokane Shock had a bye week this week. =Week 7: vs. Bakersfield Blitz= at Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena, Spokane, Washington The Blitz's offense made the most of their scoring opportunities converting on five of seven opportunities in the red zone, led by QB Denny Gile (18/37, 181 yards, 3 touchdowns). The Shock's offense countered with three touchdowns led by QB Andrico Hines (18/31, 168 yards, 2 touchdowns). After the game, Hines stressed the importance of getting back to the \\"fundamentals\\" of the game. The fundamentals of the game seemed to hurt both teams, as they combined for 27 penalties that accounted for 163 yards. Several calls were questioned by the sell-out Shock crowd that nullified two would-be touchdowns. Shock Head Coach Adam Shackleford would not comment on the officiating in his post-game press conference. Blitz WR Rennard Reynolds led the team in receptions (7) for 71 yards with two touchdowns. The Shock's receiving core, already decimated by injuries, had to call on Rob Keefe to play on both sides of the ball and ended up leading the team in receptions (6) for 38 yards. =Week 8: @ Boise Burn= at Qwest Arena, Boise, Idaho The defending af2 National Champions Spokane Shock scored the first 20 points of the game and never looked back as they handed the Boise Burn their first home loss of the year. 62-44 in front of 5,353 fans at Qwest Arena Shock QB Andrico Hines (Schutt Offensive Player of the Game) started the scoring when he hit WR Antwone Savage for a 23-yard TD 7 minutes into the game giving Spokane the early 6-0 lead. 15 seconds later The momentum really shifted into the hands of the Shock on the ensuing kick off. John Koker's kick took a wild bounce off the net and Ben Brown recovered the loose ball in the end zone (John Koker PAT) giving Spokane the early 13-0 lead. Ben Brown then did some damage on offense. Brown took a Hines hand off 16 yards up the gut untouched giving the Shock a 20-point lead they would never relinquish. Boise finally got on the board 22 seconds later, when Bart Hendricks found Cole Clasen for a 16-yard score bringing Boise to within 14. Hendricks would close the gap to 8 on a 1-yard QB keeper with 26 seconds left to go in the half, but the Shock answered with a 25-yard field Goal as time expired and Spokane would lead by 11 at the Break. In the 3rd Quarter Spokane outscored the Burn 19-8, Hines connected with Kelvin Dickens on a 6-yard TD pass and after a Lee Marks 26 yard TD, Hines found Savage on a pair of TD's (21,11) giving the Shock a 42-20 lead after 3 quarters. The game really took a turn for the worse, when both teams exchanged words and fists at the 11:22 mark of the 4th quarter. 5 players were ejected including the ADT Defensive layer of the Game Rob Keefe. Also thrown out of the game were Nygel Rogers of Spokane and Dustin Rykert, Chris Bruhn and Tyler Bruhn of Boise. In the 4th quarter, the Burn outscored Spokane 24-20 but fell to 4 and 3 with the 62-44 loss. =Week 9: vs. Central Valley Coyotes= at Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena, Spokane, Washington In a game reminiscent of last season's championship run, the Shock pulled out the victory on the last play of the game with an 18-yard touchdown pass from QB Justin Rummell to WR Kelvin Dickens. Rummell's game-winning touchdown pass was set up after a beautiful 48 yard kick-off return by Antwone Savage. With only :15 second left in the fourth quarter, the Coyotes marched down the field and capitalized with a one-yard punishing touchdown run by Tonae Martin that put them up by three points, 63-60. As the Shock lined up for the ensuing kick-off, Savage headed out to the field for the return, his only return of the game after being limited by a slight hamstring strain. Rummell was inserted into the lineup after Hines was pulled due to injury in the second quarter. Hines finished the game completing seven of eleven passes with two touchdowns and no interceptions. Rummell, who was awarded the Schutt's Offensive Player of the Game Award, finished the game completing 12 of 16 passes with 213 yards and five touchdowns, including the game-winner. Dickens had another break-out game hauling in seven receptions for 153 yards with two touchdowns. Savage contributed six receptions with two touchdowns and newcomer Anthony Brown had five receptions for 68 yards. =Week 10: vs. Everett Hawks= at Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena, Spokane, Washington The Spokane Shock defeated the Everett Hawks tonight in front of a sold-out crowd, 52-47. For the second game in a row, the victory came down to the final play of the game; but this time it was the Shock's defense that sealed the win. With only four seconds left, Everett's QB Jason Campbell's pass attempt to WR Phillip Goodman fell incomplete with Shock defender Nygel Rogers draped all over him on the goal-line. The defense of the Shock came through with several key stops, including newcomer Devon Parks who was selected as the ADT Defensive Player of the Game. Parks, who signed with the team on Thursday (the same day he arrived), was inserted into the starting line-up and came through with 5 total tackles (eight assists, one solo) including a four-yard sack on the first play of the game. DB Alex Teems had the difficult assignment of covering Hawks leading receiver Josh Richey but still managed to contribute key pass break-ups (with three) and led the team in tackles. Richey, who was selected as the Schutt's Offensive Player of the Game, was the primary source of offense for the Hawks as he led the team in receptions (seven) and touchdowns (three). Teems, however, was able to shut down Richey, who did not have a single catch in the 4th quarter. The offense of the Shock was once again led by the lethal Hines-Savage combination. Savage, who led the team in receptions, fell one reception short of breaking Charles Frederick's single-game record of 15. He also had a personal best in receiving yards for the season with 179, which also led the team, and contributed four touchdowns. The Hawks defense put heavy pressure on Hines all night and came up with three sacks ‚Äì including 1.5 from former Shock DL Chuck Jones. Hines, however, still managed to complete 74 percent of his passes (20/27) with 233 yards and five touchdowns. K John Koker made a touchdown saving tackle in the 4th quarter on the 10 yard line but sustained a concussion. =Week 11: @ Bakersfield Blitz= at Rabobank Arena, Bakersfield, California The Spokane Shock reversed what had happened to them when Bakersfield played them in Spokane. In that game, the Shock jumped out to a 21-0 lead, and lost the game. In this game, the Blitz jumped out to a 21-0 lead, and lost the game. WR Antwone Savage grabbed 9 passes for 90 yards and WR Kelvin Dickens added 2 touchdowns to lead the Shock offense. Savage was named the Schutt Offensive Player of the Game. The Shock defense did a great job not letting Bakersfield QB Chad Elliott (Syracuse, '01) not get comfortable. Spokane DL Devon Parks was named ADT Defensive Player of the Week for the second week in a row after sacking Elliott twice on the night. =Week 12: @ Tri-Cities Fever= at Toyota Center, Kennewick, Washington The Fever jumped to an early 14-0 lead over the shock with two touchdown passes from QB Brian Baker. However, Spokane would respond and closed the gap to 13-20 with a 12-yard TD pass to WR Kelvin Dickens with 0.55 seconds left in the half. However, the Fever never wavered and would ultimately shut down Spokane in the final quarter. Going into the 4th down 26-27 the Fever turned up the heat. Schutt Offensive Player of the Game Brian threw for two TDs in the 4th which pulled the Fever ahead 39-37. Ironman of the Game Robert Garth also came up big in the final quarter by stripping the ball from the quarterback with about 10 minutes left in the game. The shock made a late comeback with WR Chico Mackey scoring on a 1-yard touchdown run with 19 seconds left in the game making the score 34-39. However, the Fever's Robert Garth recovered the onside kick attempt and sealed the win. =Week 13: vs. Boise Burn= at Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena, Spokane, Washington The game marked the return of WR Raul Vijil who was inserted into the starting line-up after sitting out the last week against Tri-Cities due to injury. Vijil made the most of his return, breaking the Shock's single game record for TD receptions in a game with six. (The record was previously held by Antwone Savage and Charles Frederick who each had five in separate games last season.) Vijil also accounted for 122 yards with 13 total catches. Vijil and starting QB Andrico Hines formed a special chemistry early in the season and that chemistry returned tonight. Hines turned in a commanding performance completing 71% of his passes (24/34) for 255 yards with all six of his touchdown passes thrown to Vijil. WR Kelvin Dickens also had one of his best games of the season, accounting for 10 receptions with 125 yards to lead the team in reception yardage. The Shock's defense was led by Defensive Player of the Game Nygel Rogers. Rogers led the team in total tackles (5.5), pass break-ups (4) and also led the team in interceptions (2 ‚Äì returned for 60 yards total). Alex Teems also turned in an award-winning performance earning the Cutter's Catch of the Game by making a diving interception in the end zone. DS Rob Keefe also got into the action coming up with a 4th Quarter interception that sealed the victory for the Shock. Teems, Keefe, and Rogers each had two interceptions each. This tied the record that Keefe set last season, for most receptions in a game. =Week 14: @ Central Valley Coyotes= at Selland Arena, Fresno, California WR Antwone Savage, who sat out the prior week with an injury, returned to action and set a new franchise record for touchdown receptions. His eight touchdowns tied the af2 record and broke the previous team record of six that fellow receiver Raul Vijil had set the week before. Savage also tied the team's single-game receiving record, which was set last season by Charles Frederick, with 195 receiving yards. After the Shock struggled in the first quarter, both offensively and defensively, Savage came up with a touchdown from QB Andrico Hines on 4th down and 5 that helped to jumpstart the Shock's offense, scoring more points than they had all season (76). Hines turned in another incredible performance after a rocky start. After missing on his first six passes, Hines quickly caught on fire breaking a new team record for touchdown passes in a game (9), breaking the record that previously belonged to QB Alex Neist. Defensively, the Shock came up with key stops to limit Central Valley's powerful offense led. QB Clay Groefsema. Groefsema (25/41, 304 yards, 6 passing TD's, 1 rushing TD) keyed in on his favorite targets once again in Tonae Martin and Justin Barnes. Barnes led the team in touchdown receptions (2) while Martin led the team in receiving yards (112). =Week 15: BYE WEEK= The Shock had a bye week. =Week 16: vs. Tri-Cities Fever= at Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena, Spokane, Washington This game, beyond play- off implications, was also important for Head Coach Adam Shackleford and the Shock to even their series with division rival the Tri-Cities Fever and prove that they belong at the top of the Western Division. They proved themselves in front of over 10, 600 fans, defeating the Fever 56-36. The win locks up a playoff spot for the Shock. The Fever's offense, led by QB Brian Baker, sputtered a bit in the first half scoring only 14 points against a stingy Shock defense. DL Devon Parks, who won the ADT Defensive Player of the Game Award, contributed two sacks on the night. After playing in only five games for the Shock, Parks already owns the club record for sacks in a season (6) breaking Neil Purvis' record (3.5) from last season. QB Andrico Hines ran a very efficient offense throwing six touchdown passes, with only 139 yards of total passing yards. Hines (21-27, 139 yards, 6 TD's) hooked up with WR Antwone Savage for four touchdowns to add to his season total of 38 touchdown receptions. WR Chico Mackey, who tied Savage for the team lead in receptions (7), filled in for WR Raul Vijil who left the game in the first quarter after re-aggravating his ankle injury. =Week 17: @ Amarillo Dusters= at Amarillo Civic Center, Amarillo, Texas The Shock lost two key members of their offense. QB Andrico Hines went down in the first quarter with a strained back while WR Antwone Savage went down with an injured toe. After the game, Head Coach Adam Shackleford said that Hines will be ready to return to action next week, while Savage will be a game time decision. hackleford explained. The Shock defense forced Dusters' QB Steve Panella into 3 interceptions, and kept him off balance all night. Panella struggled, going 19 of 40 for 143 yards with just 1 touchdown. The Dusters were unable to muster any running game against the Shock, totaling 0 net yards on 6 attempts as a team. Derek Watson led the Dusters with 10 catches for 53 yards and 1 touchdown. Meanwhile, quarterback Justin Rummell of the Shock took over for an injured Hines early in the first quarter, and was careful with the football for the remainder of the game. He completed 8 of 16 passes for 164 yards and 3 touchdowns, and did not turn the ball over. Chico Mackey and Katon Bethay had impressive nights rushing the football. Mackey carried the ball 4 times for 38 yards and 2 touchdowns, while Bethay had 9 carries for 29 yards and a touchdown as well. Antwone Savage led all receivers with 2 catches for 81 yards and 2 touchdowns. The win wrapped up the American Conference's Western Division title and also assured the Shock of at least one home play-off game. =Week 18: @ Everett Hawks= at Everett Events Center, Everett, Washington The Shock came to Everett with nothing to gain having already locked up the No. 2 seed in the American Conference playoffs, but they played like a team on a mission in dismantling the Everett Hawks 65-38. The Shock had just four offensive plays in the 1st quarter but managed to score three offensive touchdowns. The Hawks on the other hand had 16 plays but only scored when Aaron Dunklin took an attempted onside kick in for 6 points early in the quarter. The Hawks were as close as 26-22 in the second quarter, but the Shock blew it open from there. The Shock held a 32-22 lead at the half and it never got closer as the Hawks lost the game and their collective cools down the stretch. QB Jason Campbell was ejected in the 4th quarter after the game had already been decided. Phil Goodman came in at quarterback and was 3-4 for 37 yards. Chico Mackey led the Shock with six total touchdowns (3 rushing, 3 receiving) and 123 total yards. Josh Richey led the Hawks with 182 yards on 13 receptions and two touchdowns. He finished the season with 1,958 yards, 148 receptions and 44 touchdowns. His yardage total is the 3rd best total in league history. His touchdown and reception totals will rank in the top five all-time as well.

He was selected to the Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game, after the 1961 season, and went on to be an assistant coach after his playing career. He was an All-American at the University of Notre Dame and was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1995. Martin was a star athlete at his high school in Cleveland, Ohio. He joined the United States Marine Corps after graduating, and served in the Pacific War until it ended in 1945. He then enrolled at Notre Dame, where he was part of a teams that won the college football national championship in 1946, 1947 and 1949 under head coach Frank Leahy. Martin was named a first-team All-American in 1949 by several news organizations. The NFL's Cleveland Browns selected Martin in the 1950 draft, and he played there for one season during which the team won the NFL championship. Browns head coach Paul Brown traded him to the Detroit Lions, where he played between 1951 and 1961, at first as a guard and later as a linebacker and placekicker. The Lions won NFL championships in 1952, 1953 and 1957, all three of them victories over the Browns. After spending a year as an assistant coach for the Denver Broncos, an American Football League team, Martin returned to playing in 1963 for the Baltimore Colts, and played for a final year in 1964 for the Washington Redskins. When he left the Lions, Martin was the team's all-time leading field goal kicker; he also became the first NFL player to kick two field goals of more than 50 yards in a single game in 1960. Martin was an assistant high school coach in California and at Idaho State University before taking a job as an assistant with the Lions between 1967 and 1972. He also coached in the World Football League in the mid-1970s. Martin later worked as a court officer in Michigan. He was inducted into the Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame in 1976 and into the college hall of fame in 1995. He died in 2002. Early life and college Martin grew up in Cleveland, Ohio and attended the city's East Technical High School, where he was captain of the football and swimming teams. He played center on the football team. After graduating, Martin joined the U.S. Marines during World War II, and served in the Pacific War. He was part of a small crew in the Marines' Fifth Amphibious Reconnaissance Battalion that landed on the island of Tinian in 1944 to do preliminary scouting in preparation for its seizure by Allied forces in the Battle of Tinian. Wearing only black swim trunks, diving fins and face masks, Martin and his three-man unit discovered a string of sea mines near a beach where Allied forces were set to land, helping guide the invasion to safer landing places. He was awarded a Bronze Star for his service in the war. After the war ended in 1945, Martin returned to the U.S. and enrolled at the University of Notre Dame. Coached by Frank Leahy, who had met and recruited Martin during the war on Iwo Jima, Notre Dame won the college football national championship by finishing first in the AP Poll in both 1946 and 1947. Martin played as an end on the team, working on both offense and defense, and was nicknamed \\"Jungle Jim\\" because of his service in the jungles of the Pacific islands. Notre Dame finished the 1948 season with a 9‚Äì0‚Äì1 win‚Äìloss‚Äìtie record and ranked second in the AP Poll. Martin switched from end to left offensive and defensive tackle for the 1949 season, when Notre Dame again finished first in the polls and won a national championship. Notre Dame did not lose a game during Martin's tenure, although it tied twice. Martin, who was co-captain in 1949, was named a first-team All-American that year by the Associated Press, the Newspaper Enterprise Association and the International News Service. He also boxed, and won Notre Dame's heavyweight title in 1949. The following summer, he played in the College All-Star Game, a now-defunct contest between the National Football League (NFL) champion and a selection of the country's best college players. He also played in the East‚ÄìWest Shrine Game, another college all-star game. Professional career Martin in 1961 The Cleveland Browns of the NFL selected Martin in the second round of the 1950 draft. Led by an offense that featured quarterback Otto Graham, fullback Marion Motley and ends Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie, Cleveland had won four championships in the All-America Football Conference leading up to the 1950 season, the team's first in the NFL. With Martin playing at defensive end, the Browns finished the 1950 season with a 10‚Äì2 record and beat the Los Angeles Rams to win the NFL championship. In a divisional playoff game against the New York Giants before the championship, Martin sacked Giants quarterback Charlie Conerly in his own end zone for a safety that helped secure a narrow 8‚Äì3 victory. The Rams scored a touchdown on their first play from scrimmage in the championship game, an 82-yard pass from Bob Waterfield to Glenn Davis. Martin was covering Davis and slipped on the play, although the Browns came back to win in the final seconds of the game. Cleveland head coach Paul Brown orchestrated a trade in 1951 that sent Martin and four other players to the Detroit Lions in exchange for the Lions' first and sixteenth picks in the following year's draft, plus cash. With the Lions, Martin helped fill a gap left by the departure of defensive end Jim Cain for service in the Army. The team finished the 1951 season with a 7‚Äì4‚Äì1 record, good for second in the NFL's National division. Led by budding quarterback Bobby Layne and halfback Doak Walker, the Lions improved to 9‚Äì3 the following year, when Martin switched to left guard. The team went on to beat the Browns in the NFL championship. Another championship victory over the Browns followed in 1953, this time by a narrow 17‚Äì16 margin. Detroit finished the 1954 regular season on top of the NFL West and again faced the Browns in the championship game, but lost by a score of 56‚Äì10. Martin switched from guard to linebacker the following year, when Detroit had a losing record. The team improved in 1956, however, and won another NFL championship over the Browns in 1957. Martin stayed with the Lions through the 1961 season. A strong placekicker, Martin was used primarily on kickoffs and on field goals in his later seasons in Detroit. In 1960, he became the first player in NFL history to kick two field goals longer than 50 yards in one game. He was selected for the Pro Bowl, the NFL's annual all-star game, in 1961 after leading the team in scoring with 15 field goals and 25 extra points. Martin, who had become the Lions' all-time leading field goal kicker in 1961, left the team the following February to take a job as an assistant coach with the Denver Broncos, a team in the American Football League. He returned to playing in 1963, however, as a kicker for the Baltimore Colts, spending one year there. He then spent a final year kicking for the Washington Redskins before retiring as a player. Coaching career After ending his playing career, Martin became an assistant coach at Mater Dei High School in California in 1965. After a year there, he became an assistant coach in 1966 at Idaho State University. The Lions then hired him as an assistant in 1967, and he stayed with his old team through the 1972 season. Martin subsequently coached for the Portland Storm in the World Football League between 1974 and 1975. Later life and death Later in life, Martin served as an officer in Michigan's 48th Michigan District Courts. He was inducted into the Greater Cleveland Sports Hall of Fame in 1976 and into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1995. He died in 2002.

The Ouachita madtom is similar to the tadpole madtom except the Ouachita madtom has one internasal pore while the tadpole madtom has two, and 16 to 18 anal rays while the tadpole madtom has only 14 to 16. It is also similar to the slender madtom but differing in the sack of serrae on the pectoral spine, having more caudal rays, and usually eight pectoral rays while the slender madtom has 9. The maximum length of an Ouachita madtom is about 2.7 inches. Distribution The Ouachita madtom was considered an Endangered Species by the IUCN in 1986 and 1988 but assessments in 1990 and 1994 showed it to be vulnerable. The Ouachita madtom is found only in the upper forks of the Saline River (Ouachita River) system and in one tributary of the Ouachita River in Central Arkansas, United States. Habitat A usual inhabitant of clear, small to medium, gravel- bottomed streams, the Ouachita madtom has been found in extremely shallow areas of the Saline River. It also is found in quiet backwaters under large rocks. Reproduction Little is known about the Ouachita madtom's reproduction. However, on August 1, 1980 six Ouachita madtoms were collected in a stream only 3.9 feet across. The six specimens were obviously young-of- the-year and their presence raised speculations that Ouachita madtoms seek smaller streams during summer months to spawn. Known food sources The Ouachia madtom starts feeding around 20 to 90 minutes after sunset. The following are known sources of food: * Ephemeropterans * Dipterans * Coleopterans * Trichopterans * Isopods * Copepods * Gastropods Environmental threats * Impoundment of water supply * Commercial gravel operations * Channelization * Clear cutting Conservation The Ouachita madtom falls under the protection of the United States' Endangered Species Act of 1973. The penalties for any form of trackifking or taking of Ouachita madtoms can be as serious as a $500,000 USD fine, 1 year imprisonment, or both. In addition to the penalties listed, civil penalties may be up to US$25,000 in fines. References * Fishes of Arkansas, Robinson, Henry W., Thomas M.

He started his working life as a servant in the family of Prof. Levi Hedge, of Cambridge, by whom he was instructed in the classics and in mathematics. Around 1832, he worked for booksellers Hilliard, Gray & Co. on Washington Street in Boston, along with William Hilliard, Harrison Gray, and J.H. Wilkins.Boston Directory. 1832. He was originally hired by Hilliard as a clerk. That firm was dissolved after the death of one of the partners and Brown went to work for Charles C. Little & Co., run by Charles Coffin Little, also a former clerk. In 1837, the firm became Charles C. Little and James Brown, and Brown remained there until his death. Augustus Flagg joined them in 1838 and would become managing partner after the deaths of the two founders.

Noone was fitted with a fake nose that initially was problematic for the production staff. Richard Lewine, the show's producer, described the problem to TV Guide: \\"Since we didn't want to cheat the audience out of seeing it grow, we hired Bil Baird to create one. Bil stood behind Pinocchio, out of camera range, holding the end of a rod that attached to the nose. When he pushed the rod, the nose, made from expandable material, lengthened. It worked beautifully,\\" Lewine said. \\"But when we went on camera, we discovered that you could see the separation between the fake nose and Peter's real one. Two hours of work with the make-up man solved the problem, but it was worrisome,\\" he said. Broadcast NBC aired the special on Sunday, December 8, 1968, at 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.

Historically, the parish of Leckwith also included land on the east side of the river Ely that is now part of Cardiff itself. This area is also commonly known as Leckwith. Etymology The name Leckwith is an anglicisation of the Welsh Lecwydd, with the common replacement of Welsh <-dd> by English <-th> (as in Gruffudd>Griffith). Lecwydd probably derives from the personal name Helygwydd (possibly the name of a local holy man or Welsh saint). The change from <-gw-> to <-cw-> may be compared to that in the personal name Tecwyn (Gwynedd O. Pierce, The Place-names of Dinas Powys Hundred. Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1968 , pp. 49‚Äì52. Since at least the nineteenth century Lecwydd sometimes appears in Welsh as Llechwydd or Llechwedd. These forms have been linked to the common Welsh noun llechwedd (hillside, slope), which has been taken to refer to Leckwith Woods, which rise up steeply from the river Ely.For example, Samuel Lewis, A Topographical Dictionary of Wales, vol. 2 (London, 1840). See also Owen Jones, Cymru: Yn Hanesyddol, Parthedegol a Bywgraphyddol (London: Blackie & Son, 1875), p. 188. Linguistically, however, there is no relationship between Lecwydd and llechwedd, and the connection is probably a result of folk etymology. This explanation of the name Lecwydd is still sometimes seen, however.Cardiff Council, Ely Valley Cross Boundary Walks: Trelai Park to Leckwith Woods.

Named as one of the greatest Aboriginal players of the 20th century, he represented Australia and Queensland, and played club football in the New South Wales Rugby League premiership for the Canberra Raiders and Brisbane Broncos, primarily as a prop forward. Backo was the first Australian forward to score tries in all three Tests of an Ashes series, and following his retirement was named in an Indigenous Australian team of the century. Early career Former chairwoman of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, Evelyn Scott gave birth to Sam Backo on . Originally from North Queensland township, Ingham he was a forward for Cairns in the Queensland Rugby League's Northern Division before moving south to Woden Valley in the New South Wales Country Rugby League's Group 8 competition in 1981. The following year he returned to his home state to play for Yeppoon in the Central Division competition. BRL and Canberra After playing in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership for Fortitude Valley, in 1983 Backo was given his first opportunity in Sydney's NSWRFL premiership with the Canberra Raiders in their second season. He made his d√©but in March and went on to play a handful of games that season. From 1984, Backo was a regular member of the starting line-up at Canberra and in 1987 appeared in his, and the club's, first grand final, which was lost to the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. While in his final season at Canberra, Backo was first selected to play State of Origin football for the Queensland Maroons in the 1988 series. He played in all three games at prop forward, scoring one try in game II and two tries in game III. Queensland won the series in a three-game whitewash. In games II and III Backo won consecutive man-of-the-match awards, one of only a handful of players to do so. During the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour Backo was selected to make his test match debut at prop forward in the first of the Ashes series against Great Britain in Sydney, scoring a try. He went on to become the first Australian forward to score tries in all three Tests of an Ashes series, and at the time he was only the second Australian player to do so after legendary winger Ken Irvine. At the end of the 1988 NSWRL season Backo was the Dally M front rower of the year. A late season injury playing for Canberra saw him miss selection in Australia's World Cup Final winning team. RFL and Brisbane Moving to England, Backo played in the 1988‚Äì89 Rugby Football League season for Leeds. on Sunday 16 October 1988 he played as an interchange, replacing prop Hugh Waddell, in Leeds' 33-12 victory over Castleford in the 1988 Yorkshire Cup Final at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds. Backo's final two seasons of top-level football, 1989 and 1990, were spent in Queensland, with the Brisbane Broncos. He was selected to go on the 1989 Kangaroo Tour of New Zealand. Backo also played in a further four games for the Maroons ‚Äì games II and III of the 1989 State of Origin series, and games II and III of the 1990 series ‚Äì despite his knee problems,Clarkson, Alan; ‚ÄòBacko May Miss Test: Fears over Knee Injury‚Äô; The Sun-Herald, 17 June 1990, p. 75 which limited his participation with his club to only five appearances during 1990 and eventually forced his retirement at the end of the season. Although selected for the 1990 Australia team to play France in the NSW country town of Parkes, he was forced to withdraw because of his ongoing knee injury. In total, Backo played in six Tests and scored three tries. In 1991, Backo made a short-lived return to football to play for Logan Scorpions in the Brisbane competition. Post playing Backo was awarded the Australian Sports Medal in 2000 for his contribution to Australia's standing in rugby league.

It was written by the popular British author/illustrator, Raymond Briggs. Unlike Briggs' other films, which were adapted from his books, Ivor the Invisible was his first project to be conceived directly for the screen. Plot One morning, a schoolboy named John awakes to find an invisible giant sitting at the foot of his bed. John names him Ivor and soon the giant is playing tricks around the house: squirting John's father with a garden hose, disturbing the laundry hanging on the clothesline, and stealing food. Ivor can create music, and later at the playground he gives John an invisible seesaw ride in the park, before playing about with ducks as it gets told off by a Park Keeper as it started to rain, so John ran under the slide. But what Ivor really wants is to learn to write. He wants John to read him stories, and he wants to go to school with him. Ivor creates a great deal of mischief at John's school, writing rude words on the chalkboard. On the way home, Ivor incites the wrath of an angry mob after tampering with the Belisha beacons and pelican crossings. John knows Ivor cannot stay with them anymore and he bids him a sad goodbye as Ivor flies off into the sky.

The group was active from 1962 to 1969 and 1978 to 2019. History Formed in 1962, The Monterays were well established on the Syracuse scene in the 1960s, and after a decade layoff in the 1970s, continued to play over 100 dates a year. The band was formed in East Syracuse, New York by Jack Abert (bass guitar/Hawaiian guitar), John Wisnewski (guitar/vocals), Larry Landry (rhythm guitar) and Jack Holton, who was soon replaced by Tommy Forrest (drums/lead vocals). Early inspirations were The Beach Boys, surf music and the theatrics of East Syracuse's first rock and roll band, The Sabres, featuring the talented lead guitarist Ron Lauback. The Monterays developed a loyal following with Syracuse teenagers, so much so that they found themselves at Riposo Studios in the fall of 1964 to wax their first single, the Beatles meets Beach Boys original \\"Bye Bye\\", and the Larry Santos penned \\"Sheryl-ane\\". (\\"Sheryl- ane\\" was also recorded by Utica, New York act The Madisons for MGM Records in 1965) After this single came and went, The Monterays signed a management deal with \\"Dandy\\" Dan Leonard, a popular disc jockey for WNDR (1965). He was able to arrange another recording sessions for the band, this time in New York City, which resulted in the Larry Santos penned \\"I'll Be Around\\" on the A side, with the Madisons on side B. The single was released on the Twin Hit label, and went on to sell 500 copies in Upstate New York. At this point Landry and Forrest departed (both joined the military) and were replaced by Dan Elliott (n√©e Rubado) (lead vocals) and Dave Moziak (rhythm guitar) (ex-The Dimensions) and drummer Dave Usiatynski (Tommy Forrest took up the lead vocal duties for another popular Syracuse band The Saint and the Sinners also featuring guitarist Ron Lauback). This is the version of The Monterays that created the most buzz around New York State. Things seemed to be looking up, Dan Leonard booked them into various clubs and live functions (scoring a major coup by getting the band an opening slot on the Beach Boys concert at the Syracuse War Memorial in July 1966. The third single \\"Very Last Day\\"/\\"You Belong To My Heart\\" (Sahara Rec. #118) was released in late 1966 and sold about as well the last one. The Monterays scored another coup by wooing away keyboardist George Day from The Saint and the Sinners just in time to record their fourth single \\"If Wishes Were Horses\\"/\\"Conquistador\\". The single was recorded again at Riposo Studios, produced by Dan Leonard and the A side featured Thomas Bacon on French Horn. Released on the tiny Buff Records label, \\"If Wishes Were Horses\\" (Buff # 323681) took off regionally, and The Monterays soon found themselves on A&M; Records's radar. A&M; ultimately passed, preferring to sign the band Procol Harum instead (\\"Conquistador\\" was written by Procol Harum members Brooker/Reid but recorded by The Monterays first). Without the promotional support of a major label, \\"If Wishes were Horses\\" peaked at ##88 on the Cashbox charts in October 1968. By this time, The Monterays (Elliott/Abert/Moziak/Wisnewski/Usiatynski/Day) were now a seven piece, with Tommy Forrest returning on vocals. Unfortunately, family and outside interests began to tear the band apart, and The Monterays split in 1969. Dan Elliott resurfaced with the rock band Wilksbury Brigade, before joining The Glenn Miller Orchestra in 1973. A year later, he joined The Belmonts (of Dion and the Belmonts fame). George Day opened Dayson Studios, recording many top Upstate New York musicians from 1970-1987. George Day also became involved with Ron Wray who curated the Syracuse area artists rock and roll album series in the 1970s and '80s. Tommy Forrest remained active as well, fronting local act The Seven into the early 70s. In 1978, The \\"Wishes\\"-era Monterays reformed for a one off show at The Beginning club in Syracuse NY to over two thousand people. But after Dan Elliott left California after finishing work on H.B. Halicki's film The Junkman, he reformed The Monterays permanently. Then called Dan Elliott and the Monterays, they became a mainstay on the Syracuse scene, and recorded a single for the Belmonts-owned AIR Records label (\\"Stay Awhile\\"/\\"Ruby Baby\\" 1983), and winning a SAMMY (Syracuse Area Music Awards) lifetime achievement award in 1996. The group has undergone some major changes in recent years, with the departures of Jack Abert in 2002 (Jack stayed on as executive producer and live sound mixer), George Day in 2004, and Dave Moziak in 2005. Ron Lauback joined the band in 2002 first as a replacement for Jack Abert, then switching to lead guitar in 2005 with the departure of Dave Moziak. His son Ronnie Dark was added on drums in 2003. Other members in the 2000s included Rob Medugno on keyboards (2005‚Äì2007), Brian Carr (bass/vocals 2005-2011), and Wayne Muller (keyboards 2007‚Äìpresent). Founding member Jack Abert died on August 16, 2009 in Florida. Longtime bassist Brian Carr departed in October 2011. The band has reshuffled their line-up again with Ronnie Dark taking over bass guitar duties. Ron's first replacement on drums, Teddy O Ted Boileau left in August 2012. 2012 marked The Monterays' 50th year in the music business. Dan Elliott died on June 23, 2019.

Robinson. It is a Lambda Literary Award winner, published by Orb Books. It tells the story of a generational ship and its crew on a long mission to search for extraterrestrial life in the galaxy and the complex conflict brewing within the crew and within the protagonist when the ship begins to fall apart. Plot The story is told through the narrative of Sparrow, a crew member aboard the Astron, which is a multigenerational starship sent from Earth on a search for life on other planets throughout the Milky Way. Sparrow fell off a cliff during one planetside excursion and is stricken with amnesia. No one will discuss his past with him and the computer has restricted his data, reasoning that he should \\"look within\\" to fully recover. Sparrow struggles to revive his memory and familiarizes himself with the Astron, the crew, the enigmatic Captain Kusaka, the state of the ship and its mission; in which the search for life has lasted over 2000 years with no success. The ship has slowly shrunk from cannibalizing sealed off sections for parts and breaking apart from centuries of wear; meanwhile, the crew has dwindled from generations of selective breeding. The Captain wants to take the Astron to a section of the galaxy where stars are more numerous and older where planets are more likely to harbor life, but to do so they would have to cross the empty space between spiral arms they call \\"the Dark\\". Most members of the crew know that they will not survive the journey since it would take several centuries to cross and the ship would not make it with its current rate of attrition of their closed ecological system. But Captain Kusaka, who is immortal and obsessed with exploration, does not heed to the warnings and will do whatever it takes to complete the mission. As a result, the crew secretly try to plan a mutiny to seize control of the ship and return to Earth, the only place they know that harbors life. Sparrow refuses to join the mutiny with his friends against Kusaka, but is torn since he knows they won't survive the trip and that chances of finding life are almost nonexistent, thus making the mission futile but the Captain won't accept it. Things change when Sparrow slowly discovers that he is also immortal like the Captain, and that he has lived previous \\"lives\\" on the ship as the same man but with different names and his memories of every previous identity are erased every generation by orders of the Captain. He learns that he originally volunteered for the role to be the mirror for every crew to \\"remember what its like to be human\\"; since they've been isolated from the rest of humanity over the centuries the crew has formed their own collective-mind culture that's overly benign and incapable of harm since they regard life as the most precious thing in existence (also makes them reluctant to mutiny). Sparrow also learns that he was the first mutineer and Kusaka erased his memories to keep the crew in line and Sparrow from seizing control of the ship since the Astron's central computer only responds to the minds of the immortal crew members, and should they be removed the ship would not function and would drift through space forever. When they leave the last star system explored to enter \\"the Dark\\", Captain Kusaka tries to suppress the conspirators even though they are benign, but Sparrow gives them the resolution to fight when they realize that since the ship has traveled so far through relativistic time dilation, human civilization on Earth may have ceased to exist and that they may be the only known lifeforms left in the universe. Moreover, since the governments that sent them out no longer exist, Kusaka is no longer lawfully in command. In a last-ditch attempt at mutiny, most of the crew board shuttles and landers and leave the ship, preferring to die quickly in space than to venture into \\"the Dark\\" with Kusaka. Meanwhile, before the mutineers' life support fails, Sparrow fights Kusaka alone in a hidden room that holds the preserved remains of the original first generation crew. This triggers all of Sparrow's memories and past personalities to surface at once in a dissociative identity breakdown, which leads to the resurfacing of his original identity: Raymond Stone. In the ensuing fight Raymond fatally wounds Kusaka. With the mutiny over, Raymond takes command of the Astron and sets a course back to Earth, which takes 20 generations (400 years) to reach. During that time, Raymond watches the crew he has known age and die and recycled for mass on the ship as well as their descendant crews come and go, thus making him realize the value of life and the price of immortality. The story ends when the Astron, after 2500 ship-years (or approximately 17,000 time-dilated Julian years as calculated earlier), finally returns to an uninhabited Earth for the descendants of the original crew and Raymond to repopulate. While they are celebrating, they are shocked to discover an alien ship has also found Earth.

It is a centralized monarchy governed by the Fontainon dynasty, governing from their ornate capital of Vienne. It is also the home of the university-city of Lodun, a great center of learning, producing world- renowned scholars in medicine, law and sorcery. Its neighbors are the nations of Adera, Umberwald and Parscia, as well as Bisra, its long-standing enemy. Ile-Rien shares a coastline along the Western Ocean with Parscia. Superficially, Ile-Rien resembles France, with its highly sophisticated culture, cuisine and fashions, as well as its one-time rarefied nobility. Many of the names invented by Wells have a Gallic flavor to them. Additionally, Wells uses French terms with respect to food and drink. Although the name \\"Ile-Rien\\" is taken from the French for \\"Island of Nothing\\", Wells has stated that she did not intend this. Over the course of the novels, Ile-Rien develops technologically and culturally, with advances such gas lamps replacing candles, before being replaced by electric lights, and trains and motor-cars replacing horse-drawn conveyances. The government, once an absolute monarchy, develops into a more meritocratic and representative system supplementing the crown. The Element of Fire In the first of the books to be set there, The Element of Fire, Ile-Rien is ruled by the Dowager Queen Ravenna, who was the daughter of the previous king, who shares power with her son, King Roland, and his new queen consort, Falaise. Queen Ravenna's consort, King Fulstan, is deceased. The Princess Katherine, Fulstan's bastard daughter by the Queen of Air and Darkness, Moire, maintains an uneasy relationship with both her brother Roland and Ravenna. A skilled, yet capricious, sorceress, she goes by the name 'Kade Carrion.' The representation of Ile-Rien in Element is that of a refined and baroque culture with a high aristocratic class and orders of knights still prevalent, roughly equivalent to 17th century France. A significant difference is the omnipresence of sorcery and magic. The University of Lodun produces internationally esteemed sorcerers, who are vital to the governance of the nation and its security. The Royal Palace in Vienne requires a court sorcerer to maintain the complex and interlocking wards around the grounds to prevent attack from its terrestrial enemies, as well its otherworldly ones, the Fay, inhabitants of the faerie-world, both the Seelie and Unseelie Courts, as well that of Kade Carrion's own mother. Death of the Necromancer In The Death of the Necromancer, the second novel, society in Ile-Rien has advanced to a stage equivalent to that of 19th century France, with elements of Victorian England as well. A young Fontainion queen, a descendant of King Roland, still rules in Vienne, yet the society seems to be advancing into a nascent industrial stage, with gas lamps and steam-powered trains becoming common. This book was a finalist for the Nebula Award given out by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America. The Fall of Ile- Rien Trilogy In the trilogy titled the Fall of Ile-Rien, comprising the novels The Wizard Hunters, The Ships of Air and The Gate of Gods, society in Ile-Rien has progressed to a stage that is similar to the early 20th Century, with electric lights, motor-cars and telephones. However, magic and its applications are still common, and highly integrated into Riennish culture and society. While still a wealthy and prosperous nation, Ile-Rien is succumbing to a brutal invasion from the Gardier, a mysterious sorcerous race, and much of its magnificent buildings and institutions are in ruins. The Gardier placed the city of Lodun under siege, trapping its powerful sorcerers behind an impenetrable barrier, making them unavailable to the war effort, where they are sorely needed. This being a grand of age of technology and progress, opulent ocean liners such as the massive Queen Ravenna (inspired by the Cunard Line's Queen Mary and Queen Falaise have been converted from their original purposes into troop transport and evacuation ships. The young Fontainon Queen from Necromancer has aged and married, and relocated the government from besieged Vienne to neighboring Parscia, Ile-Rien's ally in the war. In addition to the Queen herself, the royal family also consists of the Prince Ilaron and the adolescent Princess Olympe.

But \\"H√∏na tripper i berget\\" was the title in Jorgen Moe's manuscript from 1838, after of Ringerike. Synopsis An old widow had three daughters, and only one hen for livestock. The hen had gone missing, and the widow she sent her eldest to find it, even if she had to go out in the hill above where they lived.

The middle daughter was sent out to look for her sister and the hen, but met the same fate. The youngest daughter too fell down the chute, but prudently did some exploring, so that when she opened the hatch-door to the cellar she discovered her dead sisters inside. Since she deduced what befell her sisters, when asked by the troll to be his sweetheart, she pretended to agree wholeheartedly. Though she was furnished with fine clothing and anything else she desired, she proclaimed one day that she worried for her mother, who must be hungry and thirsty, with no one else there to attend to her. The troll would not allow her to go home, but if wanted, she could fill a sack with food, which he would carry to her mother. The youngest daughter stuffed the sack with gold and silver and put a little food on top to camouflage it. She forbade him to look inside along the way.

The youngest sister awaited opportunity, and when the troll was away from home, used the crock to restore life to her oldest sister. Concealing the revived sister inside the sack, camouflaged with food on top, the youngest told the troll to carry that sack again to her mother, making him promise never to peek inside. When the troll did try to sneak a look, he heard a voice shout \\"I see what you're at!\\", prompting the baffled troll to answer \\"You've got one devil of a pair of eyes\\".Pokker til √òine, \\"damned sharp eyes\\" (Christensen tr.); \\"The deuce you do!.. plaguy sharp eyes\\" (Dasent tr.) The word pokker is glossed as \\"devil\\" or \\"a mild oath\\", as well as a \\"blemish or rash from smallpox, etc. disease\\". The voice actually came from the sister he was carrying in the sack, but he mistook it for his sweetheart shouting.The same motif occurs in other analogue tales, such as the Italian How the Devil Married Three Sisters where the devil thinks he is watched from his bride from a long distance, even though the voice came from the bride's revived sister he was carrying. The youngest made the troll carry the middle sister the same way, except it was a great deal heavier this time because she stuffed the sack with gold and silver as well. A tvare, the traditional Norwegian stirring- stick The youngest then devised a scheme to make her own getaway. She gained more time by feigning sickness and telling him it was no use coming back until twelve midnight, because she will not have his dinner ready before then. Then she stuffed straw into her clothes, and propped up the figure by the hearth, making the dummy look like it was holding a stirring-stick (', pictured right) in its hand.Dasent renders the straw-lass's tool as \\"a besom (a broom) in her hand\\" and had it standing by the chimney. But ' is generally glossed as a stirring stick. She then ran back home to her mother, and had a sharpshooter to stay with them. The troll came back to his home demanded his supper; when the straw-woman did not answer, he struck and realized what had happened; then he saw the bodies of her sisters were missing as well. Raging, he came after them, but the sharp shooter scared him off. He went back, but just as he was to go below ground, the sun rose, and he shattered into bits. Variants A discussion of the Norwegian variants in English occurs in the piece written by Reidar Thoralf Christiansen for the festschrift to Stith Thompson (1957). The antagonist may be a giant (Rise) instead of a troll, and indeed, Norwegian scholars often class the tale group under the title \\"Risen og de tre s√∏stre\\". In some variants the hen has the habit of wandering off to lay her eggs, and the women tie a string to the hen's leg to follow the trail of where it went. Others bear the title Gullskjaeren (\\"Golden magpie\\"), and feature a gold magpie (skjaere) that lures the sister to the giant's house. =Localization= A disproportionate number of specimens come from the parish of B√∏herad (B√∏, Telemark) transcribed in the period from 1878 and 1880. The folklore of the area, including the tale group, is the subject of a book by Moltke Moe (1925). Aarne-Thompson classification The tale is classified Aarne-Thompson type 311, \\"Rescue by the Sister\\". The correspondence with the Grimms' fairy tale KHM 46 Fitcher's Bird in this group was noted by Brothers Grimm..Grimm cites \\"Asbj√∂rnsen (and Moe) p.237\\" from the first edition of 1843. e-text at: A lengthy list of folktales parallelling this Grimms' tale is given by Johannes Bolte and Ji≈ô√≠ Pol√≠vka's Anmerkungen (abbreviated \\"BP\\"), although not all on the list are strictly type 311. Type 311 tales included Italian folktale \\"How the Devil Married Three Sisters,\\"\\"Nr. 11 Der Teufel heirathet drei Schwestern\\", which has many variants recorded across Italian regions. There is also a Scottish analogue. In Campbell, Popular Tales of the West Highlands, the author says the Norwegian tale is the \\"same as \\" the 3rd variant to \\"The Widow and her Daughters\\" (No. 41). Campbell did not print the Scottish variant in full, but noted it was the same as \\"The History of Mr. Greenwood\\" among Peter Buchan's collected papers, unpublished at the time, but later appearing in 1908.

He was best known for his roles as Sayid in White Sun of the Desert (1969) and the title character in the Soviet stage adaptation of the Swedish children's book series Karlsson-on-the-Roof (1971) at Moscow's famed Satire Theatre. Biography Spartak Mishulin was born on October 22 in 1926 in Moscow. His mother, Anna Vasilievna Mishulina, was deputy to the People's Commissar of Industry and was a member of the party nomenklatura. The name Spartak was given at the insistence of his maternal uncle, a well-known historian, Professor Alexander Vasilyevich Mishulin, who specialized in the War of Spartacus. The Mishulins' family lived in the center of Moscow on Nastasinsky Lane. Spartak from an early age was fascinated by the theater and dreamed of becoming an actor. In 1937, Anna Mishulina was arrested as an enemy of the people and exiled to Tashkent, and Spartak remained in the care of his uncle Alexander Mishulin, who held the post of rector of the Academy of Social Sciences under the Central Committee of the Communist Party. After the outbreak of the Great Patriotic War, the Mishulins' family found themselves in evacuation in Dzerzhinsk). In 1941, Spartak Mishulin entered the artillery school in Anzhero-Sudzhensk by mistake, he misunderstood its name which was a portmanteau word () and thought that it was an acting school. After studying at the artillery school, he committed a misdemeanor for which he served a 1.5 year sentence. In the labor camp Spartak met his uncle's personal driver by chance, also a fellow convict. The driver was the head of the mill and took the young man as his subordinate water carrier. After a while he was caught bringing grain instead of water to the prisoners, thereby prolonging his term for another year and a half. But even in the labor camp he did not cease to engage in amateur activities. Once he was noticed by a club manager and was invited to his village Brusovo Udomelsky District of the Kalinin region. For a while, Mishulin worked as a manager at the Brusovo club, and later in various provincial theaters. Afterwards his relatives found him. In the early 1950s, after failing to enter Russian Academy of Theatre Arts, Spartak Mishulin was sent to the auxiliary staff of Kalinin Drama Theater; having graduated from the theater studio at this theater and for the first five years of working on the stage having played about 40 roles, Mishulin moved to the troupe of the Omsk Drama Theater, then returned to Kalinin. In 1957 he joined the CPSU. In 1960, after the tour of the Kalinin Theater in Moscow, Mishulin was invited to the three capital's theaters - Lenkom Theatre, Russian Army Theatre and Moscow Satire Theatre. Having chosen the Satire Theatre, he served there continuously for 45 years. The first episodes of the television series \\"Pub\\" of 13 Chairs, in which he performed the role of Pan Director, brought wide popularity to the actor. His popularity grew even more after performing the role of Tarakanov in the film Property of the Republic, as well as demonstrations on television of the plays of the Satire Theatre \\"Kid and Karlsson-on-the-Roof\\" and \\"Small Comedies of the Big House\\", but especially after the role of Sayid in the film Vladimir Motyl White Sun of the Desert. One of his longest-running roles in the theater was the role of Karlsson-on-the-Roof, whom he played for almost 40 years. In 1992, Aleksandr Shirvindt staged a performance in the theater according to his own scenario - benefit concert of Mishulin \\"Spartak\\" (Mishulin) - \\"Spectator\\" (national team). Spartak Mishulin died July 17, 2005 in Moscow at the age of 79 from heart failure. He was buried at the Vagankovo cemetery.  Family  His wife is Valentina Konstantinovna Mishulina (Kazakova) (born 1945). Daughter Karina Spartakovna Mishulina (born 1979). Son Timur Eremeev.

It was held annually at Earls Court beginning in 2003, later expanding to be also held at the Birmingham NEC from 2005 with the two shows being around one week apart. The show took up either one or two halls at both venues, and there were usually two parts to it: the Exhibition and the Main Show. From 2011 the show was rebranded and relaunched as \\"Top Gear Live\\", tying together its close links to the Top Gear television series and with a venue change to ExCeL London. Top Gear Live was later expanded, being used by BBC Worldwide as a brand of touring stadium show.  Exhibition Section  Visitors arrive and have the opportunity to take a look at exhibitors' stands. Many are there to advertise a product that they sell (for example there was a 'Shell' stand at MPH '06 advertising Shell V Power) There are also exhibition stands advertising car lease, whilst showing actual cars that can be leased at the stand. These are the likes of the Ferrari Enzo, Lamborghini Murcielago LP640, Ferrari F430 or the Aston Martin DBS V12. Two Spyker C8 Spyders at MPH 07 There are also a few car manufacturers exhibiting, although not to the scale of the 'Sunday Times Motor Show'. At MPH 2006, Land Rover turned half of the hall into a simulated off-road environment with ramps and severe slopes, on which people could drive the new Land Rover Discovery 3. There are also VIP enclosures such as 'The Sunday Times' enclosure, or the 'Auto Express' enclosure in which people with VIP tickets can go and enjoy a glass of wine for example. Overall, the exhibition side of the show is very and does not include many car manufacturers.  Main show  The main event is a 90-minute show, which takes up an entire hall and has the audience sitting in stadium- like seating. The show features stunt driving and a catwalk-style presentation of new cars. Also included in the show are the usual team antics, well known from Top Gear and TGT; at MPH 2006 they placed James May in a shopping trolley and pushed him across the hall with a Ford Mustang at 40 mph into huge ten-pin bowling skittles. There were also 3D presentations during the show; for example MPH 2005, included a virtual and life-size 3D Apache helicopter shooting at a real Lotus Elise as it raced around the arena. Pyrotechnics added live explosions to the display, simulating missile hits and ricochets from gunfire; due to its success, it made a return appearance in 2006. MPH 2006 also included a virtual 3D Hummer being dropped out of an aircraft, shot down by a Tornado jet, and landing in pieces in the ocean. A 3D Gatso Camera/Dragon of the future battled it out with the Stig at MPH 2007. In 2006, the MPH show was presented by Jeremy Clarkson and James May (Top Gear presenters), and Tiff Needell (Fifth Gear presenter) who was drafted in to cover for Richard Hammond who could not make the show due to a crash. At MPH 2007 the presenters were Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond (then the Top Gear presenters). Exhibited cars in the MPH 2006 show included the Caparo T1, Pagani Zonda F, Jaguar XKR, Lamborghini LP640, Bentley GTC, Koenigsegg CCX, Spyker C8, Spyker D8, Lamborghini Gallardo Spyder, Invicta, and the Porsche Cayenne Magnum black gunsmoke.

The events and trial of the suspect attracted national newspaper attention. The young textile worker's life has inspired such fictional treatments as Theodore Dreiser's 1925 novel An American Tragedy, and Jennifer Donnelly's 2003 novel A Northern Light. The murder was analyzed and explored in two non-fiction books, both published in 1986: Adirondack Tragedy: The Gillette Murder Case of 1906, written by Joseph W. Brownell and Patricia A. Wawrzaszek, and Murder in the Adirondacks: An American Tragedy Revisited, by Craig Brandon.  Childhood  Brown grew up in South Otselic, New York, the middle child and a daughter of a successful Chenango County dairy farmer and his wife. She was reportedly given the nickname \\"Billy\\" because of her love of the contemporary hit song Won't You Come Home Bill Bailey. She attended grammar school in the village, and became close friends with teacher Maud Kenyon Crumb and her husband. Brown later often signed her love letters \\"The Kid\\" after the Western outlaw Billy the Kid. In 1904, at the age of eighteen, Brown moved to nearby Cortland to live with her married sister Ada, and to work at the new Gillette Skirt Factory.ovcs.org -Retrieved 2011-02-18  Romance  Chester Gillette, nephew of the factory owner, had had a less stable childhood. He moved to Cortland in 1905 and started working at the company. Because of his uncle, he met people in upper-class society in Cortland. He also began a romantic and sexual relationship with Brown, a \\"factory girl.\\" In Spring 1906, Brown became pregnant, and she returned to her parents in South Otselic. Gillette agreed to take her away to the Adirondacks, apparently promising marriage. Because Brown packed her entire wardrobe for the trip and Gillette packed just a small suitcase, some 21st-century writers suggest that Gillette had promised to take Brown to a maternity home in upstate New York, where she could live until she delivered the child. Gillette and Brown stayed for a night in Utica, New York. They continued by train to Tupper Lake in Franklin County, where they spent another night. Rain the next day ruined their plans for an outing on a nearby lake, so they returned south by train to Big Moose Lake in Herkimer County, New York.  Murder  On July 11, the couple were seen rowing out on Big Moose Lake near Covewood Lodge. Gillette had entered the pseudonym \\"Carl Grahm\\" in the hotel register (since Gillette's suitcase was monogrammed \\"C.E.G.\\", he chose a name with the same initials). While they were on the lake, Gillette is believed to have struck Brown over the head with a tennis racket, and she fell out of the boat and drowned. Gillette returned alone, and gave varying explanations for what had occurred.Staff report (July 14, 1906). \\"Mystery in Girl's Death: Body Found in Adirondack Lake -- Man Companion Missing\\"], New York Times After Brown's body was found the next day, Gillette was arrested in the nearby town of Inlet, New York. The defense at trial claimed that Grace had been confused, and suddenly jumped out of the boat and into the water, despite being fully clothed. Gillette testified, \\"We talked a little more, then she got up and jumped in the water, just jumped in.\\"\\"Grace Brown a suicide, says Gillette at trial\\", New York Times, 29 November 1906; nytimes.com -Retrieved 2011-02-18  Love letters  From Gillette's rented room, authorities confiscated Brown's love letters to Gillette as evidence. District attorney George Ward read the letters aloud to the court during the trial in the fall of 1906, and Brown's letters gained the trial national attention. In her letters, Brown pleaded with Gillette to accept responsibility for her pregnancy. In her final letter, written July 5, Brown looked forward to her impending Adirondack trip with Gillette. She said farewell to her childhood home of South Otselic, wishing she could confess her pregnancy to her mother: > \\"I know I shall never see any of them again. And mamma! Great heavens, how I > do love mamma! I don't know what I shall do without her (...) Sometimes I > think if I could tell mamma, but I can't. She has trouble enough as it is, > and I couldn't break her heart like that. If I come back dead, perhaps if > she does not know, she won't be angry with me.\\"\\"Grace Brown's letters stir > audience to tears\\", New York Times, 21 November 1906 Copies of Brown's love letters were published in booklet form, and sold outside the courtroom during the trial. Theodore Dreiser paraphrased many of these letters in his novel An American Tragedy, quoting the final letter almost verbatim. Jennifer Donnelly used many of the letters in her novel A Northern Light. Letters written between the two, as well as Gillette's diary, have been donated to Hamilton College.  Trial The trial lasted three weeks, and resulted in a guilty verdict for Gillette for the premeditated murder of Brown; he was sentenced to death. The New York Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, and Governor Charles Evans Hughes refused to grant clemency. Gillette was executed on March 30, 1908 in Auburn Correctional Facility by electrocution.

It was directed by Earl Bellamy, who also directed a number of episodes in the series. The film was produced immediately after the television series completed filming for its original run, and included the original cast with the exception of Marilyn, who was played by Debbie Watson replacing Pat Priest from the series. Plot Herman Munster (Fred Gwynne) and his wife, Lily (Yvonne De Carlo) learn from Cavanaugh Munster's will that they have inherited an English manor known as Munster Hall in Shroudshire, England, and that Herman has inherited the designation Lord of the Manor as \\"Lord Munster\\". The family boards the famous American transatlantic passenger ocean liner SS United States (in its last years) to England. Herman gets seasick, Marilyn (Debbie Watson, replacing TV series original player Pat Priest in a controversial move) encounters a new love and suitor Roger Moresby (Robert Pine). Grandpa (Al Lewis) gets turned into a grey wolf upon accidentally consuming a wolf pill. Grandpa has to be sneaked through British immigration and customs. Cousins Grace (Jeanne Arnold) and Freddie (Terry-Thomas) are furious that the American Munsters are getting the manor, and that Herman will be Lord Munster instead of Freddie. Grace and Freddie, with the help of Lady Effigie (Hermione Gingold), try to get rid of the Munsters, so the estate can be theirs. The American Munster couple feels right at home when Herman's English relatives try to scare them. Freddie disguises himself as a ghost, but screams and runs away when he encounters Herman. Grandpa sneaks out of bed to find out the secret of Munster Hall: a counterfeiting operation is at work in the basement. Later, Herman enters a race, driving Grandpa's custom dragster, the \\"DRAG-U-LA\\". Grace and Freddie attempt to interfere with him winning the race, by setting up a plot to kill him. Herman wins the race with the help of Lily. The British Munsters, including their butler, Cruikshank (John Carradine) are all exposed and apprehended by the police authorities. Herman captures Freddie and Grace by tossing tires on them. Lady Effigie is sent to Shroudshire's police station with her butler by Lily and Eddie (Butch Patrick). Herman and his family donate the land and Munster Hall to the city for historic preservation. Roger and Marilyn get together and hope to see each other again. Herman and his family head for their American home.

It was produced and released at least partly in order to introduce the characters and concept to foreign audiences, as it came in advance of international syndication for the film's source material (the television series 70 episodes). For the Transatlantic crossing, stock footage of the American passenger ocean liner, the SS United States, near the end of its active career, was utilized. Although most of the film is set in fictional \\"Shroudshire, England\\" the automobile racing scenes were shot at the Paramount Ranch Racetrack in Agoura, California. They featured the \\"DRAG-U-LA\\" custom dragster designed by famous auto customizer George Barris.  Home media  In 1997, GoodTimes Entertainment released Munster, Go Home! on VHS alongside the 1981 made-for-TV reunion movie The Munsters' Revenge. The VHS version of Munster, Go Home! is presented in an open matte 1:33:1 aspect ratio. In 2001, GoodTimes Entertainment released a DVD version of the film using the same transfer. In 2006, Universal Home Entertainment released a two-feature DVD featuring Munster, Go Home! and The Munsters' Revenge.

At their strongest, these storm systems are even more potent snowfall producers than panhandle hooks, primarily because of the mixing of Atlantic Ocean moisture into the storm system once they cross the Appalachian Mountains. Because of the general west to east movement of weather systems in the mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere, Gulf Lows rarely affect areas west of the Mississippi River. One such exception was the Halloween Blizzard of 1991. Types There are two types of \\"Gulf Lows\\": West and East Gulf Cyclones or Types Ga and Gb.as per the California Institute of Technology (CIT) As western storms (Alberta clippers, North and South Pacific and Rocky Mountain) move eastward, a trailing frontal remnant is often left in the Gulf of Mexico or the adjacent coastal states. When the frontal trough from a new cyclone enters this area, cyclogenesis often occurs on the Gulf front. This newly formed Gulf wave that moves northeastward and dominates the weather over the eastern United States and Canada. One of the basic differences between the two types is that the Ga track is west of the Appalachians and the Gb track is east of the Appalachians. =Ga= The Ga type is characterized by an upper level trough in the central and eastern part of the United States which steers the newly formed wave north and northeast over the western side of the Appalachians accompanied by widespread precipitation to the north. This type is most frequently observed in the winter and early spring. =Gb= The 1993 North American Storm Complex started out as a Gulf Low (East Gulf Low or Gb) before it eventually evolved into a nor'easter. It initially formed in the western Gulf of Mexico and moved towards Florida before turning to the north and becoming a nor'easter. Another large gulf low storm was the Great Blizzard of 1978, which brought one of the lowest non-tropical barometric pressures recorded in the United States.

Life and career Born in Rome, Gerini won the National Competition of Miss Teenager in 1985. She got her first part in a film, La ballata di Eva, at 14. She subsequently played in Ciao m√†, Roba da ricchi and Night Club, by Sergio Corbucci, and many others. At 19 she worked for the popular TV show Non √® la Rai, a sort of academy with one hundred girls singing, dancing and gaming. Gerini's first major role was in Il padre e il figlio, directed by Pasquale Pozzessere. She later moved to Paris to learn French for several months, travelling a lot between Italy and France without leaving off University. At 22 she returned to Italy and got a role as protagonist in Angelo e Beatrice, a theatrical work by Francesco Apolloni (writer and director) presented on the stage at the Theater Coliseum in Rome, where director and actor Carlo Verdone noticed her. The encounter with Verdone produced Viaggi di nozze and I'm Crazy About Iris Blond, both Christmas box-office successes. Gerini later collaborated with Leonardo Pieraccioni, Massimo Ceccherini, Antonio Rezza and Antonello De Leo, and moved both to Los Angeles, U.S. and Madrid, Spain to improve her English and Spanish, respectively. In Spain she starred in Desafinado by M. G. Pereira and La playa de Los Galagos by M. Camus. Other roles include Francesca e Nunziata, directed by Lina Wertm√ºller, Al cuore si comanda, Non ti muovere, La sconosciuta and the recent Nero bifamiliare, directed by her then-partner, singer-songwriter Federico Zampaglione (Tiromancino).

Percival went on to set up the Percival Aircraft Company, a British aircraft company in his own name. Early years Percival was born in 1898 at Albury, New South Wales, the son of Blanche Hilda Leontina Percival, n√©e Wikner and William Percival, a butter manufacturer.John McCarthy, 1988, \\"Percival, Edgar Wikner (1897‚Äì1984)\\", Australian Dictionary of Biography (18 June 2013) Edgar Percival's maternal great uncle was the Swedish philosopher Pontus Wikner. As a child Percival assisted at his family's farm, on the flats of the Hawkesbury River at Richmond, New South Wales. He also became fascinated by aviation, especially after seeing an aeroplane for the first time in 1911, when a local dental surgeon and pioneer aviator, William Ewart Hart, landed on the council field in Richmond, near the Percival property. After helping to maintain Hart's aircraft, Percival received, as a reward, his first flight. By 1912, when he was 14, Percival had designed, produced and flown his own gliders. He attended Fort Street High School, in Sydney. Percival left school at the age of 15, to become an apprentice engineer at a Sydney firm. He later enrolled at Sydney Technical College, before undertaking a short course in aeronautical engineering at Sydney University.Percival 1984, p. 463. First World War In December 1915, Percival volunteered for overseas service with the Australian Imperial Force, as a Private with the 7th Light Horse Regiment. After being promoted to temporary Sergeant, he embarked in April 1916 for Palestine. Percival requested a transfer from the AIF to pilot training with the British Royal Flying Corps (RFC), and was accepted in November 1916. After going solo in 20 minutes in 1917, Percival was assigned to No. 60 Squadron, a scout (fighter) unit in France, commanded by the Canadian ace Billy Bishop. Percival was noted for his flying skills and after he was promoted to Captain, transferred to No. 11 Squadron as one of its founding members. With 11 Sqn he saw service in the Middle East and Greece. In 1918, while serving in Egypt, Percival designed his first powered aircraft, \\"a special-purpose aircraft based on the Bristol F.2B, with the Rolls-Royce Eagle engine\\". Inter-war period Following the First World War, Percival returned to Australia with three surplus aircraft, two Avro 504s and a de Havilland DH.6 aircraft to do film work, stunt flying and barnstorming plus charter flights, operating his own charter company. A number of notable flights occurred: in 1921, he surveyed the Melbourne-Brisbane route in an Avro 504, in 1923, he won the Melbourne to Geelong Race. In Australia, Percival began to take a further interest in aircraft design; he built the winning entry in the 1924 Australian Aero Club competition to design a light aircraft. In 1926, flying an aircraft that he helped design, he competed in a Federal Government challenge for both design and piloting skills, winning ¬£940 in prize money. Later in the same year, Percival was involved in a landmark series of proving flights that helped establish the use of carrier-borne fighters, culminating in his being catapulted in a \\"navalised\\" Sopwith Pup off the USS Idaho battleship, at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Percival returned to England in 1929 where he was appointed as an Air Ministry test pilot, specializing in amphibians, seaplanes and Schneider Trophy racers and went on to set up his own firm, the Percival Aircraft Company, to produce his aircraft designs. Edgar Percival was also very active as a pilot during the interwar period; not only did he compete with regular success, but his designs were widely used by other racing and record-setting pilots who held his products in very high regard. Noted racing pilots of the time who also flew Percival's machines included C.W.A. Scott, Jim and Amy Mollison, Charles Gardner and Giles Guthrie. Many came to Percival to have their machines specially built and modified for the task in hand ‚Äì usually to extend their already long range. \\"The Hat\\" c. 1935 Percival was a noted character on the air racing scene at the time, and was often referred to in the aeronautical press of the day as \\"The Hat,\\" an epithet resulting from his omnipresent hat, which, characteristically (and resplendent in a lounge-suit), he also wore while flying. He was respected as a highly competitive and able pilot, taking great pride in being awarded the prize for \\"fastest time\\" in handicap air racing, as well as being a rather fiery, impatient and irascible businessman and employer. During this period, Edgar Percival served in the Reserve of Air Force Officers, 1929‚Äì1939 and was a founding member of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators. Percival Aircraft Company Percival's interest in aircraft technology led him to design the Saro Percival Mail Carrier (1930), one of a series of collaborative projects with Saunders Roe Ltd.. Having had interests in the company which he sold in 1932, Percival began searching for an established manufacturer to produce a \\"light\\" aeroplane that he had designed which he called the \\"Percival Gull.\\" Finding no company willing and able to take on production, Percival consequently started his own aircraft company as the Percival Aircraft Company. In collaboration with Lt. Cdr E.B.W. Leake (who was to become co-founder of Percival Aircraft), he arranged for the prototype Gull (registered as G-ABUR) to be produced by the Lowe-Wylde British Aircraft Company of Maidstone, Kent. Running the business from his private address in London (20, Grosvenor SquareSilvester 1983, p. 6.), Percival then arranged for series production to be contracted out to George Parnall & Sons, of Yate, Gloucestershire, an arrangement that lasted two years. Percival Aircraft was officially formed in 1933. In 1934, after 24 Gulls had been produced at Parnalls, Percival set up his own factory at London Gravesend Airport, Kent. Edgar Percival's aircraft were renowned for their graceful lines and outstanding performance. As a noted test pilot, Percival continued to fly his own creations; in 1935, he flew a Gull from England to Morocco and back to England, winning the Oswald Watt Gold Medal. He was the first pilot to fly from Britain to Africa and back in one day. He left Gravesend at 1.30am and returned to Croydon at 6.20pm. \\"Day trips in the future will be as commonplace as trips to Margate\\" he said in a broadcast at nine o'clock. Other famous aviators were associated with Percival aircraft; in 1933, Charles Kingsford Smith flew a Percival Gull Four named Miss Southern Cross from England to Australia in the record breaking time of 7 days, 4 hours and 44 minutes. The New Zealand aviator, Jean Batten, also used the Percival Gull to fly from England to Australia in October 1936. A pure racing derivative of the Gull series, the Percival Mew Gull flown by other illustrious pilots such as Alex Henshaw and Tom Campbell Black would go on to set many speed and distance records in the 1930s. In late 1936, Percival transferred production to larger facilities at the newly built Luton Corporation Airport in Bedfordshire. A two-bay hangar was constructed to accommodate the workshops while the design offices were set up in the original Georgian farmhouse situated nearby.Silvester 1983, p. 66. Production at Luton was then primarily focused on the Vega Gull. A small twin-engined machine, the Q6 was also produced in limited quantities, using a pair of de Havilland Gipsy Six Series II powerplants equipped with variable-pitch airscrews. Again, the same basic method of construction was employed and the finished result was an aesthetically pleasing and aerodynamically clean feederliner of its day that represented the final new design produced by the company prior to Edgar Percival selling his interests in the company. In 1938 with war imminent, Percival developed a military communications and R/T operator training version of the Vega Gull known as the Proctor. This rugged three-seater was powered by a 205 hp Gipsy Queen II engine. During the Second World War, a great deal of Proctor production was sub-contracted out and the designs of other firms, including the Airspeed Oxford and de Havilland Mosquito were, in turn, produced by Percival Aircraft at Luton.Silvester 1983, p. 173. Note: 1,300 Oxfords and 245 Mosquito aircraft were constructed at Percival Aircraft. In March 1940, Percival resigned from the company, his dual roles being taken up by P.D. Acland (formerly Aviation Manager of Vickers Ltd.) who was appointed Managing Director and Arthur Bage who became the Chief Designer.Ellison 1997, p. 38. During the war years, Percival served in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. Later years Percival Aircraft was bought in September 1944 by Hunting & Son Ltd; Edgar Percival sold his interest in his company and moved to the United States to continue work on engine technology. From 1954, his old company began trading under the name Hunting Percival Aircraft Ltd; \\"Percival\\" was not dropped from the company name until 1957. Percival became a naturalized US citizen in 1948. He went to New Zealand in 1951, where he was involved with pioneering aerial application efforts. In 1954, Percival formed a new company, Edgar Percival Aircraft Limited, at Stapleford Aerodrome, England. The company's first design, the Edgar Percival E.P.9 was a utility aircraft well suited to agricultural use. A total of 21 were constructed before Percival sold his company in 1960 to Samlesbury Engineering; the new company formed Lancashire Aircraft Company to continue aircraft construction of the E.P.9. At the time of his death in 1984, Percival was working on aviation projects in the UK and New Zealand. References =Notes= =Bibliography= * Ellison, Norman H.

The show's producers contracted George Barris to provide the Koach. Barris paid show car designer Tom Daniel $200 to design the car, and had it built at Barris Kustoms, first by Tex Smith, but finished by Dick Dean, his shop foreman at the time. The Munster Koach appeared in over twenty episodes throughout the series' two-year run, and was also seen in Munster, Go Home! using different wheels. Tom Daniel's original drawing of the Munster Koach had it supercharged with a hood scoop and thin, round disc lights. Barris chose the ten-carburetor setup with the ten air horns and lantern lights. Specifications Only one Koach was made for the television series and feature film. It was made from three Ford Model T bodies and 18 feet long. The 133-inch frame was made by hand, as were the brass radiator and fenders. It has blood red interior and black pearl paint. It took 500 hours to hand- form the ornate rolled steel scrollwork. The front end had a dropped axle, split radius rods and T springs. Its design featured a custom hearse body. AMT produced a plastic model kit of the car during the series run. It has been reissued several times since. Johnny Lightning has also produced a 1/64th scale die-cast model of the car. An unauthorized reproduction Koach was built on speculation and presented to Barris, but he declined to buy it. Tubbs Johnson, Barris' paint man, purchased the unauthorized Koach and later sold it to Jay Orhbach. Barris auctioned the original Munster Koach in 1982 with oversized gas lights and different tires and wheels. In 1984, Barris wanted a Munster Koach for the Hollywood Christmas Parade. He had Dick Dean build a second authorized Munster Koach. Dick Dean's son, Keith Dean, helped build it. This Koach was restored in the summer of 2011 with new black pearl paint, pie crust cheater slicks, new brass lantern lights, torque thrust mag wheels, smaller skull radiator cap, and had the dummy crank lever removed and sealed. They did not have Bobby Barr Headers, and there is a wide opening where those headers were located on the original. There were five walnut blocks between the spokes of the mag wheels in rear. The rear slicks were Firestone eleven- inch pie crust slicks. The Astro mag wheels were painted blood red just on the outside of the five spokes. There was no skull radiator cap on the original Munster Koach in the 1960s. Only later did the Munster Koach get a skull cap. Both reproduction cars have been restored, but the original has not. Series star Fred Gwynne never sat in the seat to drive the Munster Koach. Instead, he sat on the floor on the ermine-fur rugs. During the time of the television series there was a song released as a single by Decca, called \\"Here Comes the Munster Koach\\". Engine The engine was a 289 cubic-inch Ford V8 originally configured for installation in a 1964 1/2 Mustang, it was built with Jahns high compression pistons, 10 chrome plated Carter WA-1 carburetors, an Isky cam, and had a set of Bobby Barr racing headers. It had a three-speed toploader manual transmission.

There are two main types of pistols: pump and semi-automatic.  Uses of a pistol and basic use =Speedball= Paintball pistols are not used in tournament level speedball games. Due to one marker per person rules, a player may not carry two markers onto the field. A pistol has a lower shot capacity, leaving the player at a severe disadvantage against an opponent. Sometimes in recreational settings a player will agree to play with a pistol to put themselves at a severe disadvantage to attempt to prove superior skill over an opponent. Playing in such a situation has many similarities to stock paintball. Despite these apparent disadvantages there are a growing number of players who choose to play with a pistol as their primary marker. =Scenario= Paintball pistols are primarily used as a sidearm. The use of a paintball pistol is often as a last resort situation. In scenario games often drivers of paintball tanks will utilize a paintball pistol as a backup marker. Some players use them as their primary weapons, such as this player from the paintball team Reaper's Black Hearts from the Woodsball Tournament League.http://www.woodsballtournament.com/pics/reaper.jpg =Bush= Paintball pistols are often used as sidearms. Some players have learned diversionary tactics with pistols, pretending to fumble or reload the main marker, only to pull up a close range shot with a pistol. Many players find this kind of action unsportsmanlike, and some fields ban the use of sidearms. Manufacturers Paintball pistols are manufactured by a number of companies in a few main calibers. The three calibers are 11mm/.43 cal, .50 cal, and .68 cal . The main manufacturers of paintball pistols are Tippmann, Tiberius Arms (now called First Strike), and Kingman. The price points on the pistols range from approximately $100‚Äì$400. Walther, the gun manufacturer based in Germany, also makes .43 caliber paintball pistol replicas of a few of its real pistols as training tools for police forces. These paintball markers are built to match the weight, action, and feel of the real gun. These markers have the designation \\"RAM\\" which stands for \\"real action marker\\", which means they match the real pistol they represent in the slide action, recoil, safety mechanism, and of course weight.  Accessories  Many accessories are available for paintball pistols including holsters, mock silencers, scopes, flashlights, laser lights, and high performance part kits. Another new development from paintball manufacturers is First Strike Rounds. First strike rounds are designed to replace the .68 caliber paintball and are being introduced into the market. They can be very useful in paintball pistols where accuracy can be an issue. The advantage to using first strike rounds is their uniform shape. Most regular paint balls can easily become malformed causing the paintball to veer off course and resulting in numerous misses. When you only have a few rounds as is the case with paintball pistols this can end up in your elimination from the game. First Strike Rounds allow consistency and accuracy even in pistols.  Pros and Cons  As compared to a standard paintball marker: = Pros = *Extremely light *Can be carried in holster or in a harness *Smaller profile / no hopper *More maneuverable / portable *Can be a back-up to main \\"weapon\\" *Less exposure while blind firing (a practice banned on most fields) *Easier reload *Lesser jam frequency *Quick change of the tank or rubber gripsPaintball Pistol = Cons = *Smaller ammunition capacity *Smaller air capacity (usually 12 gram CO2 powerlets to fire 20-50 shots, sometimes 3‚Äì4 oz tanks) *Specialty equipment needed to carry the smaller tubes/magazines and CO2 powerlets.

Philanthropy  Kappa Phi Gamma Sororities render service to the community and respective campuses. Since her inception in November 1998, the Sisterhood has participated in a variety of service projects. However, the sisterhood has dedicated itself to its national philanthropy, cancer awareness. The founders discovered, that in one way or another, almost all of them had been affected by cancer. They realized that cancer does not discriminate by race, sex, or class; it can affect anyone. For those reasons, the founders chose to devote our philanthropy for cancer awareness. Every Spring, Kappa Phi Gamma around the nation plans Cancer Awareness: a Real Effort! (C.A.R.E.) Week. C.A.R.E Week is a week long series of events dedicated to raising funds for a cancer organization and to bring awareness to the community about the truths of cancer. To date, Kappa Phi Gamma has raised over $70,000 and has donated their services to over 40 different charities. C.A.R.E. Week has been recognized by the Asian Cup Award for being the only organization of its kind to commit a week of events towards cancer awareness, while incorporating educational and entertaining activities in order to educate the public about early detection and prevention of cancer. Events held during C.A.R.E. Week include, but are not limited to: Kick-Off Rally, Candlelight Vigil, cancer workshops/forums, Mr. C.A.R.E. Week Pageant, sports tournaments, bake sales, and movie viewings. All proceeds raised during C.A.R.E. Week are donated to an array of organizations that are committed to cancer awareness, including, but not limited to, the Linda Creed Breast Cancer Foundation, Bite Me Cancer, the Scott and White Center for Cancer Prevention and Care-Hope Fund, Make-A-Wish Foundation, the American Cancer Society, and the Lance Armstrong Foundation.  Scholarship  Pursuing academic excellence is an integral part of Kappa Phi Gamma. To promote the principle of academic scholarship, Kappa Phi Gamma strives to promote and recognize the academic achievement of South Asian women. The Emerald Endowment is an annual scholarship awarded by the sorority to a female student not associated with the sorority who has demonstrated excellence in scholarship, leadership, and service.

Jacob Micyllus,In Antiquity Micyllus was the poor cobbler of Lucian's Gallus (6 April 1503 ‚Äì 28 January 1558) was a German Renaissance humanist and teacher, who conducted the city's Latin school in Frankfurt and held a chair at the University of Heidelberg, during times of great cultural stress in Germany. Micyllus was born Jakob Moltzer in Strasbourg. From 1518 to 1522 he studied in Erfurt, then at the end of 1522 went to Philipp Melanchthon in Wittenberg. From 1524, aged only twenty-one, he directed the city Latin school at Frankfurt, on Melanchthon's recommendation. But he was not at ease with the radical Reformation in Frankfurt from 1526 and found a place as professor in Heidelberg, January 1533. He died in Heidelberg.

The blue cast is from the colour of the building's windows Kurt Reuber, self-portrait made in Stalingrad The Stalingrad Madonna () is an image of the Virgin Mary drawn by a German soldier, Kurt Reuber, in 1942 during the Battle of Stalingrad. The original is displayed in the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church, Berlin, while copies now hang in the cathedrals of Berlin, Coventry, and Kazan Cathedral, Volgograd, as a sign of the reconciliation between Germany and its enemies the United Kingdom and Russia during the Second World War.Perry, p. 7. Design The piece is a simple charcoal sketch, measuring three feet by four feet . Mary is depicted wrapped in a large shawl, holding the infant Jesus close to her cheek. On the right border are the words Licht, Leben, Liebe (\\"Light, Life, Love\\"), from the Gospel of John. On the left, Reuber wrote Weihnachten im Kessel 1942 (\\"Christmas at the Siege 1942\\") and at the bottom Festung Stalingrad (\\"Fortress Stalingrad\\"). Kessel (\\"Cauldron\\") is the German term for an encircled military area, and Fortress Stalingrad was the label for the encircled army promoted in the Nazi press. History The picture was drawn by Lieutenant Kurt Reuber, a German staff physician and Protestant pastor, in December 1942 during the Battle of Stalingrad. Reuber wrote: > I wondered for a long while what I should paint, and in the end I decided on > a Madonna, or mother and child. I have turned my hole in the frozen mud into > a studio. The space is too small for me to be able to see the picture > properly, so I climb on to a stool and look down at it from above, to get > the perspective right.

But I wish I could tell you how absorbed I have been painting my > Madonna, and how much it means to me. > The picture looks like this: the mother's head and the child's lean toward > each other, and a large cloak enfolds them both. It is intended to symbolize > \\"security\\" and \\"mother love\\". I remembered the words of St.John: light, > life, and love. What more can I add? I wanted to suggest these three things > in the homely and common vision of a mother with her child and the security > that they represent. He added that he: > went to all the bunkers, brought my drawing to the men, and chatted with > them. How they sat there! Like being in their dear homes with mother for the > holiday. Later, Reuber hung the drawing in his bunker for his unit celebration, which he described as a moment of Christian devotion shared by all the soldiers in his command. > When according to ancient custom I opened the Christmas door, the slatted > door of our bunker, and the comrades went in, they stood as if entranced, > devout and too moved to speak in front of the picture on the clay wall. > ...The entire celebration took place under the influence of the picture, and > they thoughtfully read the words: light, life, love. ...Whether commander or > simple soldier, the Madonna was always an object of outward and inward > contemplation.Perry, p. 11. The Madonna was flown out of Stalingrad by Dr Wilhelm Grosse, his battalion commander of the 16th Panzer Division on the last transport plane to leave the encircled German 6th Army. Reuber was taken captive after the surrender of the 6th Army, and died in a Soviet prisoner of war camp in 1944. The Madonna and a number of letters from Reuber were delivered to his family. There they remained, until German Federal President Karl Carstens encouraged Reuber's surviving children to donate the work to the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church in Berlin. Springer, Reuber's three children, and Prince Louis Ferdinand (in his role as chair of the Memorial Church board of trustees) attended the dedication ceremony in August 1983.Perry, pp. 10-11 Influence The drawing and Reuber's letters were published shortly after the war, and Navy chaplain Arno P√∂tzsch wrote an apologetic book of poetry entitled The Madonna of Stalingrad in 1946.Perry, p. 18. The work became a powerful symbol of peace in the Cold War era, as well as part of the mythologising of Stalingrad and the events of the Second World War in German society.Perry, p. 8. Copies were presented, and are displayed, in the cathedrals of Volgograd (formerly Stalingrad), Berlin, and Coventry as a symbol of reconciliation. Similarly a Cross of Nails from Coventry is displayed with the Madonna in the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church. The Prisoners' Madonna Reuber painted a second similar picture in captivity around Christmas 1943. He was by this time in a prisoner of war camp in Yelabuga, some 1,000 kilometres north-east of Stalingrad, and the painting was made for the prisoners' newspaper. He titled it The Prisoners' Madonna. Reuber did not live to see another Christmas, dying of illness a few weeks later on 20 January 1944.Perry, p. 10. References =Notes= =Bibliography= *Joseph B.

Robel, 389 U.S. 258 (1967), was a case heard by the Supreme Court of the United States. The court ruled that the United States government cannot deprive the people of constitutional rights, even in the interests of national security. Specifically, the right of free association. The petitioner, Eugene Frank Robel, who worked at Todd Shipyards in Seattle, was indicted on May 21, 1963 for being a member of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) and thus affiliated with it, without being registered with the Subversive Activities Control Board in violation of the McCarran Internal Security Act section 5 (a) (I) (D). Since the act required CPUSA to register as a Communist Party, he was told because of his affiliation with the Party, he also had to register as well, and that he could no longer work at the shipyard because of his affiliation with the Communist Party; Todd Shipyards had been designated a \\"defense\\" facility, otherwise known as federal employment, which was illegal under the McCarran Act. Robel appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court. The Court found the McCarran Internal Security Act violates the defendant's right to free association that is guaranteed by the First Amendment.

He is mainly remembered for sculptures in Westminster Abbey and St Paul's Cathedral. He carved a tomb for the dramatist William Congreve in Westminster Abbey and sculptures of the apostles and evangelists on the exterior of St Paul's, a memorial to William Hewer in the interior of St Paul's Church, Clapham as well as the statue of Henry VI in School Yard, Eton College. Despite his success, later in life Bird did little sculpting. He had inherited money from his father-in-law and set up a marble import business. Life Francis Bird was born in the parish of St. James's, Westminster in 1667. At about eleven years old he was sent to Flanders where he studied under the sculptors Jan and Henri Cosyns. He then went on his first trip to Rome and returned home about 1689. He had been so long abroad he found he could hardly speak English. In London he worked under Grinling Gibbons and C. G. Cibber. After a few years, he went back to Rome for a further nine monthsRupert Gunnis, Dictionary of British Sculptors 1660‚Äì1851 where he is documented as an assistant to Pierre Le Gros the Younger in 1697.

The top curve shows the tax shield gains of debt financing, while the bottom curve includes that minus the costs of bankruptcy. The trade- off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal. An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing. Evidence The empirical relevance of the trade-off theory has often been questioned. Miller for example compared this balancing as akin to the balance between horse and rabbit content in a stew of one horse and one rabbit. Taxes are large and they are sure, while bankruptcy is rare and, according to Miller, it has low dead-weight costs. Accordingly, he suggested that if the trade-off theory were true, then firms ought to have much higher debt levels than we observe in reality. Myers was a particularly fierce critic in his Presidential address to the American Finance Association meetings in which he proposed what he called \\"the pecking order theory\\".Myers, S.C., 1984, The Capital Structure Puzzle, The Journal of Finance, Vol. 39, No. 3, Papers and Proceedings, Forty-Second Annual Meeting, American Finance Association, July, pp. 575-592 Fama and French criticized both the trade-off theory and the pecking order theory in different ways.Fama, E. and French, K. \\"Testing Tradeoff and Pecking Order Predictions about Dividends and Debt,\\" Review of Financial Studies 15 (Spring 2002), 1-37, Welch has argued that firms do not undo the impact of stock price shocks as they should under the basic trade-off theory and so the mechanical change in asset prices that makes up for most of the variation in capital structure. Despite such criticisms, the trade-off theory remains the dominant theory of corporate capital structure as taught in the main corporate finance textbooks. Dynamic versions of the model generally seem to offer enough flexibility in matching the data so, contrary to Miller's verbal argument, dynamic trade-off models are very hard to reject empirically.

This results in cost savings due to lower investment in human capital, and reduces barriers to entry, weakening the bargaining power of the human capital.Braverman, Harry (1974) Labor and monopoly capital. New York: Monthly Review Deskilling is the decline in working positions through the machinery introduced to separate workers from the production process. Deskilling can also refer to individual workers specifically. The term refers to a person becoming less proficient over time. Examples of how this can occur include changes in one's job definition, moving to a completely different field, chronic underemployment (e.g. working as a cashier instead of an accountant), and being out of the workforce for extended periods of time (e.g. quitting a position in order to focus exclusively on child-rearing).Definitions of Deskilling. Viewed February 5 2016 at http://www.thefreedictionary.com/deskilling and http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/deskilling It can also apply to immigrants who held high-skilled jobs in their countries of origin but cannot find equivalent work in their new countries and so are left to perform low- skilled work they are overqualified for. This can often be the result of problems in getting foreign-issued professional qualifications and degrees recognized, or discriminatory hiring practices that favor native-born workers. It is criticized for decreasing quality, demeaning labor (rendering work mechanical, rather than thoughtful and making workers automatons rather than artisans), and undermining community.Lerner, Sally (1994) \\"The future of work in North America: Good jobs, bad jobs, beyond jobs\\". Futures, 26(2):185-196. DOI 10.1016/0016-3287(94)90108-2.

In an application to the arts, Benjamin Buchloh defines deskilling as \\"a concept of considerable importance in describing numerous artistic endeavors throughout the twentieth century with relative precision.

It was the first twin-engined aircraft to be operated from an aircraft carrier. Development and design In 1925, the United States Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics designed a twin-engined torpedo bomber aircraft, intended to have greater performance than contemporary single- engined aircraft. A single prototype was built by the Naval Aircraft Factory as the XTN-1, which was quickly followed by three identical aircraft built by Douglas, the T2D-1. The XTN/T2D was a large two bay biplane, capable of easy conversion between floats and wheels, and carrying a crew of four. Operational history The first three T2D-1's were delivered to the torpedo bomber squadron VT-2 on 25 May 1927, being used for successful trials aboard the aircraft carrier . A further nine T2D-1's were ordered in 1927, these normally being operated as floatplanes, partly owing to criticism from the Army of the Navy operating large land-based bombers, and partly as its large size prevented Langley from embarking a full airwing. A further 18 aircraft were ordered in June 1930 as patrol floatplanes, being designated P2D-1. These were operated by Patrol Squadron VP-3 in the Panama Canal Zone until they were replaced by Consolidated PBYs in 1937.

On Easter Sunday, a cart, packed full of fireworks and other pyrotechnics, is lit and provides a historic spectacle in the civic life of the city.  History The event of the Scoppio del Carro has its origins in the First Crusade, when Europeans laid siege to the city of Jerusalem in a conflict to claim Palestine for Christianity. In 1097, Pazzino de' Pazzi, a Florentine from a prominent family, was by tradition the first man to scale the walls of Jerusalem. As a reward for this act of bravery, his commander gave him three flints from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, which were then carried back to Tuscany. These are kept in the Church of Santi Apostoli. It became the practice for a \\"holy fire\\" to be struck from these flints at Eastertide, which was then carried throughout the city by groups of young men bearing torches. In time, this tradition evolved to something similar to what is seen today; a cart bearing a large candle was rolled through the city to the cathedral, from where the holy fire would be distributed. By the end of the 15th century, the Scoppio del Carro assumed its present form. The ultimate origins of the event may be quasi-pagan, since it involves a display of great noise and light to ensure a good harvest. Additionally, farmers from the Florentine countryside still observe the Scoppio del Carro with interest for this traditional reason.  The event  On the morning of Easter Sunday, the antique cart (in use for over 500 years), moves from the Porta al Prato to the Piazza del Duomo. Hauled by a team of white oxen festooned with garlands of the first flowers and herbs of spring, the cart is escorted by 150 soldiers, musicians, and people in 15th century dress. Meanwhile, a fire is struck using the historic flints from Jerusalem at Chiesa degli Santi Apostoli. It is then carried in procession to the cathedral square by members of the Pazzi family, clerics, and city officials. The cart is loaded with fireworks while a wire, stretching to the high altar inside the cathedral, is fitted with a mechanical dove (the \\"colombina\\"). Shortly thereafter, at the singing of the Gloria in excelsis Deo during Easter Mass, the cardinal of Florence lights a fuse in the colombina with the Easter fire. It then speeds through the church to ignite the cart outside. During all of these stages, the bells of Giotto's campanile ring out. The complex fireworks show that follows lasts about 20 minutes. A successful display from the \\"Explosion of the Cart\\" is supposed to guarantee a good harvest, stable civic life, and good business.

It is situated in the Qozhaya valley, the northern branch of the valley of Qadisha, to the east of Ehden. It overlooks Ehden, Kfarsghab, Bane and Hadath El Jebbeh. Given its exceptional location commanding the valley at 1500 meters altitude, the monastery is called the Watchful Eye of Qadisha. It is dedicated to Saints Sarkis and Bakhos (Saints Sergius and Bacchus). The name Ras Al Nahr means the top of the river as it is in the vicinity of the Mar Sarkis Source, the main contributor to the river Qlaynsieh which, after joining the Qannoubine river, will form near Tripoli the river Abou Ali. The Monastery belongs to the Lebanese Antonin Maronite Order, a Monastic Order founded on August 15, 1700 by the Maronite Patriarch Gabriel Al Blouzani from Blaouza (1704-1705). In the Middle East, several monasteries are dedicated to those two Saints. For more information, readers can see Mar Sarkis. History The first church of Saints Sarkis and Bakhos was built in the mid 8th Century A.D. on the ruins of a Canaanite temple dedicated to a divinity of agriculture. Next to it, another church dedicated to Our Lady was constructed in 1198 A.D. Several buildings were added from 1404 till 1690, when Patriarch Estephan El DouaihyPatriarch Estephan Douaihy on Ehden Family Tree website restored part of the buildings. It is interesting to know that: *the Monastery was the Episcopal See of Ehden from 1473 till 1739, *the French hermit Fran√ßois de Chasteuil lived in this monastery before moving in 1643 to the Monastery Mar Elisha Bsharri, *Patriarch Estephan El Douaihy (1670-1704) was ordained priest in this Monastery on March 25, 1656. The Monastery belonged to the Douaihy family whose priests and Bishops resided in it and paid all its taxes and maintenance. On September 1, 1739, the Monastery was given to the Antonin Maronite Order who extended and improved its buildings and properties since then. In 1854, the Antonin Maronite Order founded the Monastery of Mar Sarkis, Zgharta in order to allow the monks of Mar Sarkis to spend wintertimes away from the rigorous climate of the mountain. In 1938, the two monastic communities of Ehden and Zgharta were merged. References * Abi Khalil, Father Sharbel (1995): Tarikh Deir Al Qiddissayn Sarkis wa Bakhos, Ehden, J.

Skilled workers are generally more trained, higher paid, and have more responsibilities than unskilled workers. Skilled workers have long had historical import (see Division of labor) as masons, carpenters, blacksmiths, bakers, brewers, coopers, printers and other occupations that are economically productive. Skilled workers were often politically active through their craft guilds. ''' Relative demand of skilled labor One of the factors that increases the relative demand for skilled labor is the introduction of computers. In order to operate computers, workers must build up their human capital in order to learn how such a piece of machinery works. Thus, there is an increase in the demand for skilled labor. In addition to the technological change of computers, the introduction of electricity also replaces man power (unskilled labor) which alters the demand for labor skills. Technology, however, is not the only factor. Trade and the effects of globalization also play roles in affecting the relative demand for skilled labor. For example, a developed country purchasing imports from a developing country, which then replaces products made with domestic, low-skills labor. This, in turn, decreases the demand for low-skills workers in the developed country. Both of these factors may increase the wages of highly skilled workers in the developed country.  Foundation, transferable, and technical and vocational skills  The EFA Global Monitoring Report 2012, proposes a useful approach to different types of skills in relation to the world of work. It identifies three main types of skills that all young people need ‚Äì foundation, transferable, and technical and vocational skills ‚Äì and the contexts in which they may be acquired. = Foundation skills = At their most elemental, foundation skills are the literacy and numeracy skills necessary for getting work that pays enough to meet daily needs. These foundations are also a prerequisite for engaging in further education and training, and for acquiring transferable skills and technical and vocational skills. = Transferable skills = Finding and keeping work require a broad range of skills that can be transferred and adapted to different work needs and environments. Transferable skills include analysing problems and reaching appropriate solutions, communicating ideas and information effectively, being creative, showing leadership and conscientiousness, and demonstrating entrepreneurial capabilities. Such skills are nurtured to some extent outside the school environment. They can, however, be further developed through education and training. = Technical and vocational skills = Many jobs require specific technical know-how, whether related to growing vegetables, using a sewing machine, engaging in bricklaying or carpentry, or working on a computer in an office. Technical and vocational skills can be acquired through work placement programs linked to secondary schooling and formal technical and vocational education, or through work-based training, including traditional apprenticeships and agricultural cooperatives.

The story takes place between \\"King of the Klondike\\" and \\"Hearts of the Yukon\\" in the series The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck making it part 8B. The story shows how Goldie O'Gilt was taken to Scrooge's claim by the White Agony Creek. As Don Rosa announced his retirement in June 2008, this is his last story to date. The story was first published in the Danish Anders And & Co. #2006-22; the first American publication was in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck Companion collection in 2006. Plot The story takes place in 1897, during the Klondike Gold Rush. It features Scrooge McDuck, who abducts Goldie O'Gilt and takes her to White Agony Creek, where she is forced to dig for gold. Meanwhile, Soapy Slick sends three famous lawmen, Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, and Judge Roy Bean, to rescue Goldie from Scrooge but it seems she doesn't want to be rescued -- at least not until after she steals Scrooge's gold nugget. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid are also involved in this caper; they kidnap Goldie and steal Scrooge's nugget. But Scrooge eventually rescues Goldie and gets his nugget back. Surprisingly for a duck story, the end of the tale implies a sexual relationship between Scrooge and Goldie. The story is told through a memory that was sparked, when Donald, Huey, Dewey, and Louie wanted to know what is Scrooge's most valuable possession. Their guesses (the Money Bin, the Number One Dime, the Goose Egg Nugget, and Castle McDuck) were wrong: the most valuable is the wreath of Goldie's hair, which he received, when he saved her from a bear (by throwing a knife between Goldie and the bear, which didn't harm either of them but scared the bear off and severed off a wreath from Goldie's hair).

Early life  Kathy Kohner-Zuckerman was born Katherine Klara Kohner in 1941, the daughter of European Jewish immigrants Franzie and Frederick Kohner, a Czechoslovakian Jew who worked as a screenwriter for the German film industry until 1933.\\"Gidget: the story of Hollywood's first surfing star\\" She grew up in Brentwood, Los Angeles, and spent much of her childhood on the beaches at Malibu. From age 13 to 15, Kohner lived in Berlin with her parents where the family had moved so that Frederick could work with film producer Artur Brauner. She started surfing at the age of 15, sometimes trading her peanut butter and radish sandwiches for chances to ride. She associated with such influential surfers as Miki Dora, Mickey Munoz, Dewey Weber, and Tom Morey. At the age of 17, Kathy appeared on the television and radio quiz program You Bet Your Life with Groucho Marx. During her conversation with Groucho, she revealed herself to be the inspiration for her father creating the character of Gidget. She won $500 and chose not to contest the major prize.  Gidget phenomenon  Based on what Kohner told her father about her exploits in Malibu and her journal of her trips to Malibu, which her father discovered, he wrote Gidget: The Little Girl with Big Ideas. The book sold over 500,000 copies and was translated into Japanese, Spanish and Hebrew, among other languages. In 1959, Columbia Pictures, where Frederick Kohner had been a screen writer, adapted the novel into a film starring Sandra Dee. Two other Gidget films were made, as well as a 1965 television series starring Sally Field and several television movies.  Adult life  Kohner-Zuckerman attended Los Angeles Valley College, San Fernando Valley State College (now California State University, Northridge), and Oregon State University and then returned to Los Angeles to teach. She married Marvin Zuckerman, a professor of English and Yiddish who had never heard of \\"Gidget\\". They have two children and live in Pacific Palisades. Kohner-Zuckerman still surfs annually to benefit a cancer charity. She was named No. 7 in Surfer Magazine's 25 Most Influential People in Surfing. In 2008 she was inducted into the Southern California Jewish Sports Hall of Fame. In 2011, Kohner-Zuckerman was inducted into the Surfing Walk of Fame in Huntington Beach, California in the Woman of the Year category.

Overview Scotticisms are generally divided into two types:Aitken, A.J. Scottish Accents and Dialects in Trudgil, P. Language in the British Isles. 1984. p.105-108 covert Scotticisms, which generally go unnoticed as being particularly Scottish by those using them, and overt Scotticisms, usually used for stylistic effect, with those using them aware of their Scottish nature. Perhaps the most common covert Scotticism is the use of wee (meaning small or unimportant) as in \\"I'll just have a wee drink...\\". This adjective is used frequently in speech at all levels of society.http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/S4_LocalGovernmentandRegenerationCommittee/Inquiries/LGRC_Benchmarking_Seminar_10_September_2012_-_Transcript.pdf An archetypal example of an overt Scotticism is \\"'\\", which translates as \\"Oh yes, just now\\". This phrase is often used in parody by non-Scots and although the phrases \\"'\\" and \\"'\\" are in common use by Scots separately, they are rarely used together. Other phrases of this sort include: * Hoots mon! * ' (a phrase popularised by the music hall entertainer Harry Lauder) * ' literally translates to \\"Long may your chimney smoke!\\",Gordon Kenmuir, Scottish National signifying \\"may you live long\\" * ' (well-known from the comic strip character Oor Wullie) Many leading figures of the Scottish Enlightenment, particularly David Hume, strove to excise Scotticisms from their writing in an attempt to make their work more accessible to an English and wider European audience. In the following passage, Hume's contemporary James Boswell pondered upon the reasons why the Scots and the English were not always mutually intelligible:F A Pottle (ed.), Boswell In Holland, Heinemann 1952, pp.160-1 > It is thus that has arisen the greatest difference between English and > Scots. Half the words are changed only a little, but the result of that is > that a Scot is often not understood in England. I do not know the reason for > it, but it is a matter of observation that although an Englishman often does > not understand a Scot, it is rare that a Scot has trouble in understanding > what an Englishman says... It is ridiculous to give the reason for it that a > Scot is quicker than an Englishman and consequently cleverer in > understanding everything. It is equally ridiculous to say that English is so > musical that it charms the ears and lures men to understand it, while Scots > shocks and disgusts by its harshness. I agree that English is much more > agreeable than Scots, but I do not find that an acceptable solution for what > we are trying to expound. The true reason for it is that books and public > discourse in Scotland are in the English tongue. Modern authorities agree that the Scots language was gradually eclipsed after the adoption of the Protestant English Bible during the Scottish Reformation and as a result of the later institutional dominance of southern English following the Union of the Crowns in 1603 and the Act of Union in 1707.R McCrum, W Cran, R MacNeil, The Story of English, London 1986, pp.143-4D Murison, The Guid Scots Tongue, Edinburgh 1977, pp.5-6B Kay, The Mither Tongue, Collins 1988, Ch.5 Scots Law was a notable exception in retaining much of its traditional terminology such as Act of Sederunt, sheriff-substitute, procurator fiscal, sasine, pursuer, interlocutor (court order) and messenger- at-arms. There is now a strong move in some quarters to restore the use of Scots. Examples Examples of Scotticisms in everyday use include: * Where do you stay? meaning \\"Where do you live?\\" Possible answer: \\"I stay in Dundee\\" * ? meaning \\"Where do you live?\\" Possible answer: \\"\\" * ' meaning \\"I don't know\\" * ' meaning \\"Don't you know?\\" * ' meaning \\"I'll accompany you some of the way\\" (or meaning \\"I'll see you at home\\") * ' meaning \\"I'm going shopping for groceries.\\" * ' meaning \\"I'm very embarrassed\\" * ' meaning \\"I'm soaked\\" (usually from rain) * ' meaning \\"She's the same age as him\\" * ' meaning \\"Let me have a turn now\\" (for example, children playing) * ' meaning \\"Are you thinking of moving house?\\" (cognate to Norwegian flytte, to move [house]). * ' meaning \\"He's in a rage over it\\" * ' meaning \\"You're an awful gossip\\" * ' meaning \\"You're talking nonsense\\".

She was an anglophile who, in the 1950s, introduced to France John Bowlby's theories on the importance of maternal care, and she worked in collaboration with the Tavistock Clinic in London. She was a friend of Jacques Lacan - and whose sister was the feminist Louise Weiss, of the Javal family. Her father was physician Alexandre Roudinesco, of Romanian origin, who had \\"a passion for history and a phenomenal library\\". He was born in Bucharest in a Jewish and francophile milieu, and his father had been an editor.Freud: In His Time and Ours, by √âlisabeth Roudinesco (review). By Janet Sayers. Times Higher Education, November 10, 2016. She received her secondary education in Paris at the Coll√®ge S√©vign√©. She studied Literature at the Sorbonne, with a minor in Linguistics; her master's degree was supervised by Tzvetan Todorov, and her doctoral thesis, entitled Inscription du d√©sir et roman du sujet [Inscription of the desire and novel of the subject], by Jean Levaillant at the Universit√© Paris VIII-Vincennes in 1975. She also took classes with Michel de Certeau, Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault at the time of her master's degree . She next defended her \\"habilitation √† diriger des recherches\\" (H.D.R ‚Äì the French accreditation needed to supervise doctoral dissertations) in 1991 with Michelle Perrot as supervisor and Alain Corbin, Dominique Lecourt, Jean-Claude Passeron, Robert Castel, and Serge Leclaire as members of the examining committee. This work was published under the title G√©n√©alogies. From 1969 to 1981, she was a member of the √âcole Freudienne de Paris, founded by psychoanalyst and philosopher Jacques Lacan. She was also a member of the editorial board of Action Po√©tique (1969‚Äì1979). She has written for French national newspapers, Lib√©ration (1986‚Äì1996), and then Le Monde since 1996. For the past 30 years, she has been married to, Olivier B√©tourn√©, CEO of √âditions du Seuil. Methodology =Literary= In the 1970s, Elisabeth Roudinesco's first works dealt with literary criticism, notably with Raymond Roussel, Antonin Artaud, Bertolt Brecht and Louis-Ferdinand C√©line. At that time, her work concerned linking a singular trajectory and an author's work, without resorting to psycho-biography, in other words, the psychologization of literary work by the clinical study of its author. This approach allowed her to demonstrate that most of 20th century literature has been influenced by the history of Freudianism and psychological medicine based on the theory of degeneration.Roudinesco, L'inconscient et ses lettres, Mame, 1979 =History of psychoanalysis in France= From 1979, Elisabeth Roudinesco writes a history of psychoanalysis in France. At that time, the main model was still the biography, because the archives and documents of the psychoanalytical movement were still in the hand of Freud's heirs. Indeed, this model corresponded to the historiographical trend centered on the notion of the founding father figure; a trend which is at the core of any quest of origins. However, this model has gradually declined. Considering how psychoanalysis was established as a movement and system of thought, Elisabeth Roudinesco asserted that France was the only country where all the necessary conditions were gathered together, over a long period of time, to successfully establish Freudianism in scientific and cultural life. According to Elisabeth Roudinesco, this favorable situation dated back first to the French Revolution of 1789 which provided a scientific and legal legitimacy to reason, heed/gaze over madness, giving birth to the institution of the asylum. Then, the Dreyfus affair, which has precipitated the arrival of intellectuals' self-awareness as a class. Designating themselves as an 'avant-garde', they furnished fruitful and innovative ideas. Finally, the emergence of literary modernity with Baudelaire, Rimbaud and Lautr√©amont, who enunciate, in a new style of writing, the project of changing man through \\"I is another\\". Ellenberger Scholarly historiography emerged with such work as Henri Ellenberger's The Discovery of the Unconscious: The History and Evolution of Dynamic Psychiatry, first published in 1970. Though this book had been known in English-speaking countries since that date, the book (published in French in 1974) remained largely unnoticed in France. Elisabeth Roudinesco republished it with a lengthy new preface in 1994.Partially based on Roudinesco, G√©n√©alogies, Paris, Fayard, 1994. In his work, Ellenberger developed a conceptuality of freudianism founded on archivistics and reference to the concepts of \\"mental tools\\", \\"long length\\" and \\"system of thought\\". This last category proposed presenting doctrines in their own terms and structures. The study of the system of thought of dynamic psychiatry, psychotherapies and psychological medicine no longer echoes back to a single founder, but to a plurality of singular itineraries, shattering the biographic model. From Ellenberger's thesis, Elisabeth Roudinesco retained several guiding principles, while adding methodology derived from the works of the French epistemological school: Georges Canguilhem and Michel Foucault. Thus, the study of system of thought becomes the form in which, at a given time, knowledge achieves independence, finding balance and entering into communication: a history of a man who thinks, systems which intertwine, but also a critical analysis of the concepts of consciousness and subject of knowledge. =Lacan= In 1993, Elisabeth Roudinesco published a biography of French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan. From 1938, Lacan felt preoccupied by the generalized decline of the patriarchy and tried, like Freud and the English school, to promote the father figure within Western society, under the form of a symbolic function. Roudinesco highlighted the fact that the genius of Lacan's work is the introduction of elements from German philosophy (e.g., Nietzsche, Hegel, Heidegger) within the Freudian doctrine ‚Äì creating a phenomenon Freud would have never conceived himself, since he built his theory on a biological model (darwinism), by consciously refusing to consider and include any philosophical discourses, contemporary or ancient, in his thought process. Critic Physician and philosopher Raymond Tallis wrote a scathing review of the first English language translation of Roudinesco's biography, stating \\"The innocence with which Roudinesco reports all kinds of clinical cock-ups [in Lacan's medical career] makes this book a particularly disturbing read for a medic.\\"Tallis, Raymond (1997) \\"The Shrink from Hell\\". The Times Higher Education Supplement, 31 October 1997, p. 20. On the opposite, John Forrester, former head of the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at Cambridge University praised her work by saying that it is the most subtle and valuable work done on a national situation alongside with the work of Nathan Hale done on the American situation of psychoanalysis. =Th√©roigne de Mericourt= From the study of the melancholic Th√©roigne de Mericourt (1989), early feminist and famous case of the annals of French alienism ‚Äì she has been 'gazed' by Jean- √âtienne Esquirol in La Salp√™tri√®re ‚Äì Roudinesco think the French Revolution is a paradigm in the French situation of Freudianism. For Roudinesco, it was necessary to include the analysis of patients into the analysis of doctrines as a major constituting element of the discourses of psychopathology. =Freudianism and politic= Roudinesco think that invariant conditions are required to introduce Freudian ideas and establish psychoanalytical movement in a given space. First, a psychiatric knowledge must have been previously constituted, namely a gaze over madness able to conceptualize the notion of mental illness to the detriment of explanation such as divine possession. Secondly, the existence of a State of right capable of guaranteeing the free practice of a transmission like the transferential kind. Whenever one or both of theses elements are lacking it explains why the establishment of Freudianism has not been possible (era of the world influenced by Islam or whom the organization is still tribal) or its disappearance ( under totalitarian regime, nazism and communism). She notices that military dictatorship didn't refrain the expansion of psychoanalysis in South American (notably Brazil and Argentina). Roudinesco assesses that caudillo regimes didn't try to eradicate psychoanalysis as a \\"jewish science\\" as did Nazism in the years 1933‚Äì1944 nor as a \\"bourgeois science\\" as did communism over the period 1945‚Äì1989.Partially based on ¬´ Parcours de recherche: √âlisabeth Roudinesco ¬ª, Entretien avec Fr√©d√©ric Gros et Franck Chaumon.

She stands in debates such as laicity, cloning, genetics, innate and acquired. She fiercely criticized INSERM's reports of experts over psychotherapies. She is one of the first signers of Pas de Z√©ro de Conduite's petition against systematic detection of delinquency of children under three years of age, as advocated by another INSERM's report.

The show underwent multiple changes throughout its over nine-year run. Initially, the program revolved around a claymation-style moon character who narrated the often themed-nights, and served as the de facto host. Additionally, the show was regularly paired alongside the series 100% Weird, which brought viewers even more bizarre films. Later, in June 1993, entertainment duo Penn and Teller guest-hosted MonsterVision marathons featuring mainly old B-Movies from the 1950s and 1960s. Then, by July 31, 1993, the narrator of the series became solely a voice-over announcer. From 1996 until around the show's cancellation in 2000, the series was hosted by Joe Bob Briggs, and featured mainly classic horror and schlock films from the 1970s to the 1990s. Here, much of the original formatting under Briggs was derived from his earlier work on The Movie Channel program, Joe Bob's Drive-In Theater. Yet, this series would also incorporate Joe Bob's Last Call, a segment that presented that night's final film. Then, in 1999, the overall program became styled as Joe Bob's Hollywood Saturday Night and MonsterVision, before ultimately returning to its non-host format in mid-2000. Format = Pre-Joe Bob Briggs (1991‚Äì1996) = When MonsterVision premiered on June 29, 1991, it was little more than a marathon of older horror, science fiction, or fantasy films beginning at 8:00 PM ET and ending well into the early morning. With a claymation-style moon character serving as the original narrator and 'host', broadcasts tended to air monthly, as well as certain holidays. Films often fit a general theme, such as \\"TNT Salutes The Outer Limits\\", \\"Halloween Night\\", \\"Attack of the Sea Monsters\\", \\"A Christmas Nightmare\\", \\"Harryhausen Havoc\\", or recurring \\"Godzilla Marathons\\", although other occasions had somewhat unrelated choices. Additionally, MonsterVision sometimes had special events, such as their \\"Dracula Weekend\\", which had a mini-interview with Christopher Lee in honor of the release of Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992). A number of later marathons, beginning on June 5, 1993, were presented by the well-known entertainment duo Penn and Teller, before the show then transitioned to voice-over narration for the remaining duration of this period. = Joe Bob Briggs era (1996‚Äì2000) = Beginning on June 28, 1996, Joe Bob Briggs (John Bloom), the drive-in movie critic, became the official host of MonsterVision, with the series transitioning into a regularly scheduled Friday time slot, every week at 11:00 PM ET. MonsterVision would typically show no more than two films per night, though several episodes were much longer, such as the 1997 \\"Super Bowl Sunday Special\\", which consisted of sixteen continuous hours of horror movies. Nonetheless, on usual double- feature nights, Joe Bob Briggs would appear anywhere between sixteen and twenty-four times throughout the movies, significantly more than he did on his previous program. In these sections, Briggs would discuss the films, and more, from the inside and outside of a staged trailer home with a green neon TNT sign in the background. Briggs was also frequently visited by one of a succession of 'mail girls', including Honey (Honey Michelle Gregory), Reno, Kat (Kathy Shower), Summer (Cheryl Bartel), and Rusty (Renner St. John), who not only served as attractive, comedic 'sidekicks,' but also brought Briggs fan letters, sometimes from actual prisoners. TNT also added the segment Joe Bob's Last Call, which was used to showcase the final movie of the night. Similarly, the program was occasionally able to feature guests such as rapper and actor Ice-T, and directors Wes Craven and John Waters. When it came to the movies, MonsterVision, under Briggs, would sometimes stray away from the typical horror and science fiction films, showing westerns, blaxploitation, kung-fu, dramas, comedies and other film genres, specifically in the later years. Additionally, as a way to connect fans further to the movies being presented during episodes, MonsterVision was known for its early use of the internet at tnt.turner.com/monstervision. Here, fans were able to chat in Joe Bob's Rec Room, participate in weekly caption contests to win T-shirts, take part in Find That Flick contests to win obscure films, send fan mail, see images from the set, get free postcards, learn more about Briggs and find out about upcoming films. Nevertheless, before each film, Briggs would often give the audience his formal on-air \\"Drive-In Totals\\", a list of what he considered to be the most notable, gory, or humorous points in the film, followed by a rating of up to four stars, usually all delivered in a deadpan style. He frequently played on the term \\"kung fu\\" to describe action sequences with a particular theme, such as 'Quicksand Fu' in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985). Briggs' introduction to Phantasm II, for example, comprised: After each commercial break, Briggs would deliver a diverting short or long monologue concerning general observations about the film, as well as popular culture, society and his thoughts about life in general. These could be more serious discussions, for example, of trivia about obscure film actors, or controversies such as the race debates around films such as Big Trouble in Little China (1986). Conversely, Briggs' pieces could be more lighthearted, with deliberately outrageous political statements and occasional banter with his film crew. He frequently described his notional day-to-day activities, including supposed problems with his girlfriends (or lack thereof) and his four ex-wives (usually the fourth, \\"Wanda Bodeine\\"). Lastly, Briggs usually signed off each episode of MonsterVision with a casual debriefing on the movie just-ended, along with a series of deliberately bad jokes, and a reminder that \\"the Drive-In will never die!\\" Furthermore, during these sections, Briggs routinely criticized and lampooned TNT's censorship of the films, with frequent reference to the channel's owner, Ted Turner. This running gag culminated with a Halloween marathon of Friday the 13th movies, which portrayed strange occurrences throughout the night, leading to Joe Bob realizing that Turner was trying to 'kill' him. The final scene saw Joe Bob give an impassioned apology to Turner, claiming he was an amazing person, before the video feed cut off eerily. A similar stunt was staged in Blair Witch Project-themed scenes for a later horror marathon, with the host mysteriously missing. Beginning on June 7, 1997,New York Times, ProQuest, Television Listing - June 7/8, 1997 the series moved to Saturday nights in order to avoid further conflicts with TNT sports broadcasts. Then, on September 11, 1999, the program was almost completely revamped in order to attract a wider audience, particular more women, resulting in the creation of Joe Bob's Hollywood Saturday Night and MonsterVision. Moving from Dallas to Los Angeles, not only was the general aesthetic of the show changed to feel more 'Hollywood', but the first film of each episode going forward tended to be more 'mainstream', while the second was usually in accordance with traditional MonsterVision. Subsequently, this meant that the Joe Bob‚Äôs Last Call segment would be dropped altogether. Although the original formula of the program was now changed, this transition allowed for more guests, such as Rhonda Shear, and horror movie specials still remained a staple of the show. Nevertheless, possibly due to a decline in ratings, TNT was unable to fully justify the increased budget after the move to Los Angeles, thus shifting to a one-movie-a-night format starting on January 15, 2000. Cancellation and Shudder revival Briggs hosted MonsterVision for a little over four years, and his presence was the main reason many fans tuned-in. However, the show's format change hinted at the eventual breakdown of the MonsterVision series. Briggs himself has stated that he believes TNT's scheduling of fewer horror and drive-in movies may have led to the program's fall. Thus, on July 8, 2000, Briggs unknowingly hosted MonsterVision for the last time, airing Children of the Corn II: The Final Sacrifice (1992). Days later, Briggs received a letter from TNT management, stating that \\"his services were no longer needed.\\" Afterwards, the show returned to its original non-host format, the program's final transition. Yet, fans never received any sort of on-air closure, only officially learning about Joe Bob's departure through the main website. MonsterVision was then eventually removed from TNT's lineup after September 17, 2000.The Joe Bob Report Briggs has since remained an active speaker and writer, and has contributed commentary tracks to several DVDs. However, almost over 17 years since its cancellation, Briggs stated that Shudder had shown some interest in reviving MonsterVision. This ultimately resulted in Joe Bob's return to television in a marathon for the Shudder TV live feed. On Friday, July 13, 2018, at 9 PM EDT / 6 PM PDT, Shudder aired The Last Drive-In With Joe Bob Briggs, a roughly 26-hour and 35-minute block featuring 13 of the greatest horror movies of all time as chosen by Briggs himself. Despite some technical difficulties, these films included: Tourist Trap, Sleepaway Camp, Rabid, The Prowler, Sorority Babes in the Slimeball Bowl-O-Rama, Daughters of Darkness, Blood Feast, Basket Case, Re-Animator, Demons, The Legend of Boggy Creek, Hellraiser, and Pieces. Then, although there were no commercials, these movies contained several interruptions for Joe Bob's legendary \\"Drive-in Totals\\", insider stories, and amusing tangential rants. Additionally, these segments also included Darcy the Mail Girl (Diana Prince, born in Charleston, South Carolina June 6, 1979), who not only showed up in movie-themed outfits to banter with Joe Bob and bring him messages from fans, but also spent the entire time live-tweeting with viewers. Lastly, as with MonsterVision, the show had guests, including Felissa Rose and Lyle Blackburn. In the spirit of Thanksgiving, Joe Bob Briggs hosted the \\"Dinners of Death\\" on November 22, 2018 at 9 PM ET / 6 PM PT using a similar format as the previous marathon, but with sets more akin to those seen on MonsterVision and a runtime of about nine hours and 45 minutes. Featured movies included The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Hills Have Eyes, Dead or Alive, and Blood Rage, with special guest Michael Berryman and a brief phone call with \\"mangled dick expert\\" Felissa Rose. Next, Joe Bob Briggs hosted \\"A Very Joe Bob Christmas\\" on December 21, 2018 at 9 PM ET / 6 PM PT, the first of its nature to stream simultaneously across the US, Canada, and the UK. In a surprise twist, the entire marathon was centered around the Phantasm film series, specifically: Phantasm, Phantasm III: Lord of the Dead, Phantasm IV: Oblivion, and Phantasm: Ravager. Overall, the marathon ran for a total of eight hours and 48 minutes, with guest appearances by franchise ice cream man turned hero Reggie Bannister and Phantasm: Ravager special effects makeup coordinator Gigi Bannister. Interestingly, Joe Bob supposedly decided against showing Phantasm II (1988) due to its depicted destruction of an original 1971 Plymouth Barracuda, although it was most likely a rights issue with Universal Pictures that prevented the movie's broadcast. Additionally, since Shudder did not have the rights to use any of Don Coscarelli's music, Joe Bob closed off the show by leading everyone in a song he called the \\"12 Days of Phantasm.\\" All three sets of films are currently on demand, by individual movie segment, with Briggs now hosting weekly double features on Friday nights at 9 PM ET / 6 PM PT as a seasonal show. Premiering on March 29, 2019 with C.H.U.D. and Castle Freak, Joe Bob began the first of nine Season 1 episodes by reciting his drive-in oath. Then, appearing during the second film of the night, the guests included Barbara Crampton, who played Susan Reilly in Castle Freak, and Felissa Rose, who reprised her role as the show's \\"mangled dick expert.\\" Additionally, Shudder partnered with Rated R: A Horror Speakeasy to host a watch party in Glendale, California. Later, on April 16, 2019, beginning with \\"Week 4,\\" Darcy began holding official weekly contests to see who could guess both films being hosted by Joe Bob. Potential titles had to be submitted by each respective Friday at 8:00 PM, with winners placed into a drawing for a prize pack. Overall, guessing the films of a specific week has now become a tradition in the community, with clues coming via Brigg's Twitter account and his weekly email newsletter. On May 22, 2019, due to the continued support of, and admiration for, The Last Drive-In, Shudder announced their decision to renew the program for a second season. This was shortly followed by an official announcement video from Joe Bob Briggs himself, which was tweeted out by Darcy the Mail Girl. Then, on Saturday, July 13, 2019 at 8:00 PM ET, Shudder reran ten of the films from the original marathon, not including The Prowler, Daughters of Darkness, and The Legend of Boggy Creek. Although hinted at by Briggs earlier, on October 7, 2019 it was officially announced that he would be returning to Shudder for \\"Joe Bob's Halloween Hootenanny,\\" where he will be hosting a triple feature on Friday, October 25, 2019 at 9:00 PM ET. The same day of this Halloween special, Briggs announced that on Friday, December 13, 2019 he would be hosting his next Shudder special, \\"Joe Bob's Red Christmas.\\" The night of \\"Joe Bob's Halloween Hootenanny,\\" Briggs hosted a marathon of films from the Halloween franchise, which included Halloween (1978), Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers, and Halloween 5: The Revenge of Michael Myers, as well as a surprise phone call from Tom Atkins, who was described as a \\"Teen Heartthrob.\\" Then, during his next marathon, \\"Joe Bob's Red Christmas,\\" Briggs hosted the movies Black Christmas (1974), Jack Frost, and Silent Night, Deadly Night Part 2. Additionally, during this marathon, Darcy and Briggs honored Dinosaur Dracula with the first ever Silver Bolo Award for his contributions to the horror-fan community. On March 24, 2020, Joe Bob Briggs announced that the second season of The Last Drive-In would premiere on Friday, April 24, 2020, just in time to honor the halfway to Halloween season. Kelli Maroney and Chris Jericho served as guests during the Season 2 premiere, which aired Chopping Mall and Bloodsucking Freaks. Then, later on in the second season, in anticipation of Week 6, Darcy the Mail Girl reinstated the MonsterVision weekly caption contest for The Last Drive-In, using an archived contest image from the film Arena. This week also became relevant due to its airing of Cannibal Holocaust (1980), which prompted Joe Bob Briggs to warn the mutant family about its graphic content and led to Shudder posting solely the commentary segments without the film for the first time ever. On July 14, 2020, Shudder announced that the series would return for a third season in 2021, along with other specials in the meantime, including a ‚ÄúSummer Sleepover‚Äù double feature with horror filmmaker Adam Green, and other surprise guests, on Friday, August 14, 2020 at 9:00 PM ET. That night, Joe Bob Briggs and Darcy the Mail Girl hosted Slumber Party Massacre II and Victor Crowley in their pajamas, during which they gave a Silver Bolo Award to James Rolfe of Cinemassacre. Additionally, Felissa Rose, Adam Green, Kane Hodder, Brian Quinn, and Tiffany Shepis joined them for the second feature. On August 20, 2020, Joe Bob Briggs confirmed that the next special would be held on October 23, 2020 from a \\"very special location\\" to celebrate Halloween.

It concerns an episode in the life of Hungarian-American escapologist Harry Houdini at the height of his career in the 1920s. It was screened in a special presentation at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival.  Plot  In 1926, 13 years after his mother's death, illusionist Harry Houdini (Guy Pearce) has begun debunking mystics, psychics and others who claim to have paranormal powers. He offers US$10,000 to anyone who can quote his mother's dying words to him. Impoverished and uneducated Scottish con artist Mary McGarvie (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and her daughter Benji (Saoirse Ronan) set their sights on Houdini's reward when he visits Edinburgh on tour. Mary's psychic act pulls in the public: Benji surreptitiously gathers information on members of the audience, information Mary uses to con them into believing they can reach out to their deceased loved ones. Their only obstacle is Houdini's protective manager, Sugarman (Timothy Spall). Mary manages to charm the unsuspecting magician, but as they spend more and more time together, Sugarman intervenes, trying to prevent Houdini from becoming entangled with Mary, of whom he is suspicious. Sugarman's main desire is to see Mary and Benji gone; they claim they will be gone for good once they secure the reward for finding out what Houdini's mother said to him on her death bed. Sugarman realizes he can't get rid of them as easily as he had hoped. Mary is caught trying to open Houdini's chest and covers up by saying she was just searching for something to channel the psychic energy of the deceased. Benji gets the key to the chest from Sugarman. When Mary and Benji fail to turn up any useful information, they turn again to Sugarman. He tells them that Houdini was out doing a show and missed seeing his mother before she died. When the time comes, Mary is unable to perform the experiment and attempts to leave. At this point Benji starts having a fit on the ground and claims to be channelling Houdini's mother on her death bed, uttering the words of the Kaddish and addressing Houdini as \\"Ehrich\\", his real name, and speaking partly in German and partly in German-accented English asking where he is, and why he is not with her. This could be interpreted as either a genuine seance or a very skillful and convincing impersonation by the young artist. When the note he wrote to confirm the veracity of the experiment was removed from its safe and shown to be blank, Houdini reveals the \\"eternal shame\\" he feels because he wasn't able to reach his mother before she died, and thus was unable to comfort her in her moment of death, or to hear her final words. The McGarvies are awarded the $10,000. Mary is disgruntled because she believes Harry does not love her as she believed. When he says he does, they become romantically involved before Houdini leaves for his last performance, in Montreal. During his travels, he is climbing a set of stairs when a \\"Red-Haired Prankster\\" punches him in the stomach while he was not prepared, rupturing his appendix, eventually killing him.

It is one of many such corporate finance theories, and is often contrasted with the pecking order theory and the trade-off theory, for example. The idea that firms pay attention to market conditions in an attempt to time the market is a very old hypothesis. Baker and Wurgler (2002), claim that market timing is the first order determinant of a corporation's capital structure use of debt and equity. In other words, firms do not generally care whether they finance with debt or equity, they just choose the form of financing which, at that point in time, seems to be more valued by financial markets.Baker and Wurgler, \\"Market Timing and Capital Structure\\", The Journal of Finance, 2002. http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/content/BPL_Images/Journal_Samples/JOFI0022-1082~57~1~414%5C414.pdf Market timing is sometimes classified as part of the behavioral finance literature, because it does not explain why there would be any asset mis- pricing, or why firms would be better able to tell when there was mis-pricing than financial markets. Rather it just assumes these mis-pricing exists, and describes the behavior of firms under the even stronger assumption that firms can detect this mis-pricing better than markets can. However, any theory with time varying costs and benefits is likely to generate time varying corporate issuing decisions. This is true whether decision makers are behavioral or rational. The empirical evidence for this hypothesis is at best, mixed. Baker and Wurgler themselves show that an index of financing that reflects how much of the financing was done during hot equity periods and how much during hot debt periods is a good indicator of firm leverage over long periods subsequently. Alti studied issuance events. He found that the effect of market timing disappears after only two years.AYDOƒûAN ALTI. \\"How Persistent Is the Impact of Market Timing on Capital Structure?\\", The Journal of Finance, 2006. DOI.ORG Beyond such academic studies, a complete market timing theory ought to explain why at the same moment in time some firms issue debt while other firms issue equity. As yet nobody has tried to explain this basic problem within a market timing model. The typical version of the market timing hypothesis is thus somewhat incomplete as a matter of theory.

They are heavily used in many microbiology-related industries and fields to culture various micro-organisms and are meant to be a more efficient method for detection and enumeration compared to conventional plating techniques. A majority of its use is for the testing of foodstuffs. Petrifilm plates are designed to be as accurate as conventional plating methods. Ingredients usually vary from plate to plate depending on what micro- organism is being cultured, but generally a Petrifilm comprises a cold-water- soluble gelling agent, nutrients, and indicators for activity and enumeration. A typical Petrifilm plate has a 10 cm(H) √ó 7.5 cm(W) bottom film which contains a foam barrier accommodating the plating surface, the plating surface itself (a circular area of about 20 cm2), and a top film which encloses the sample within the Petrifilm. A 1 cm √ó 1 cm yellow grid is printed on the back of the plate to assist enumeration. A plastic ‚Äúspreader‚Äù is also used to spread the inoculum evenly.  Comparisons between Petrifilm plates and standard methods  E. Coli/Coliform Petrifilms Petrifilm plates have become widely used because of their cost-effectiveness, simplicity, convenience, and ease of use. For example, conventional plating would require preparing agar for pour plating, or using agar plates and vial inoculum loops for streak plating; but for Petrifilm plates, the agar is completely housed in a single unit so that only the sample has to be added, which saves time. For incubation, Petrifilm plates can be safely stacked and incubated just like Petri dishes. Since they are paper thin, more plates can be stacked together than Petri dishes (although 3M recommends that Petrifilms be stacked no higher than 20). For enumeration, Petrifilm plates can be used on any colony counter for enumeration just like a Petri dish. Various enumeration experiments have shown very little or no variance between counts obtained through Petrifilm and standard agar counts.Nero, L.A., Beloti, V., Barros, M.D.F., Ortolani, M.B.T., Tamanini, R. & Franco, B.D.G.D.M.

Enumeration of heterotroughs, fecal coliforms, and Escherichia coli in water: comparison of 3M Petrifilm plates with standard plating procedures [electronic version]. Journal of Microbiological Methods, 60: 335-342. In some cases, Petrifilms were more sensitive in detection than standard microbiology methods, other than the case that a higher sensitivity could possibly lead to an increased risk of false positive results.Silva, B.O., Caraviello, D.Z., Rodrigues, A.C. & Ruegg, P.L. (2005). Evaluation of Petrifilm for the Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus from Milk Samples [electronic version]. Journal of Dairy Science, 88: 3000-3006.  Procedure for using Petrifilm plates  Plastic spreader First, a sample must be prepared through standard weighing and serial dilution, with stomaching and pH adjustment if necessary. Next, to inoculate, the top layer is lifted to expose the plating surface, and with a pipette, 1mL of the diluted sample is added. The top film is then slowly rolled down and the ‚Äúspreader‚Äù is used for even distribution. It takes a minute for gelling to occur.  After incubation  EC Petrifilm which has tested positive for coliforms After the required incubation period, colonies appear either as splotches, spots which are surrounded by bubbles, or a combination of both, which differ from micro-organism to micro-organism. Enumeration can be done on a standard colony counter. Picking out individual colonies for interpretation can also be done because the top film can be lifted quite effortlessly to expose the gel. Unfortunately, if a sample is too dark in colour (e.g. chocolate or hot chocolate), enumeration becomes more difficult or impossible, since the stained colonies are less visible.

Given the complexities of poker and the constantly changing rules, most poker calculators are statistical machines, probabilities and card counting is rarely used. Poker calculators come in three flavors: poker advantage calculators, poker odds calculators and poker relative calculators. A poker odds calculator calculates a player's winning ratio. Winning ratio is defined as, the number of games won divided by the total number of games simulated in a Monte Carlo simulation for a specific player. A poker advantage calculator calculates a player's winning ratio and normalizes (see Normalization (statistics)) the winning ratio relative to the number of players. An advantage calculator, provides a normalized value between -100% and +100% describing a player's winning change in a locked domain. That is, if a player's result is -100%, regardless of the number of players in the game, the player will certainly lose the game. If a player's advantage is +100%, regardless of the number of players, the player will certainly win the game. Both a poker odds and advantage calculators can provide results provided a specific game scenario. Game scenario variables include: the number of players, the game type being played, and the hand or cards available for the player in question. Alternatively, there also exist poker relative calculators which display a player's winning chance relative to another player's chance. Poker relative calculators tend to be displayed on poker shows and tournaments for an audience because they provide an accurate assessment of a player's winning chance. However, professional in game poker players do not use or think in terms of poker relative calculations because two or more poker hands at the same table are required.

It is taken from the Secrets album of 2001 and was released as its first single. It is currently their most recent single released on a major label. It follows the standard Human League style of baritone lead vocals of Philip Oakey with choruses and incidentals jointly shared between female co-vocalists Joanne Catherall and Susan Ann Sulley (credited for the first time under her married name, Gayle, causing some erroneous comment that 'Susan Sulley' had been replaced). It was released in July 2001 and stalled at number 47 in the UK Singles Chart. Background The Human League had recently signed to Papillon Records, a subsidiary of the Chrysalis Group. Papillon were set up to capitalize on so called 'heritage acts' (bands with a large and established fan base) and the Human League were to become their headline band.Human League Media Enquiries However the label was in financial difficulties as previous releases had failed to realize Papillon Records' investments and Chrysalis were unwilling to further invest. The band recorded the studio album Secrets, their first since Octopus in 1995. \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" was to be the first single from the album and with a professional promotional music video filmed the single was expected to enter high up the UK charts heralding another return to form for the Human League similar to Octopus six years previously. Although keenly anticipated, Papillon dithered over the release date, with even Oakey stating he didn't know when the single would be eventually released.Secrets Online, Band Biography part 5 The uncertain release date for \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" prompted worries from some in the industry that Papillon Records may have been having problems and there was also little in the way of advance promotion for the single for the public, save a token advertisement in UK's tabloid Red Tops. To compound the problem in the UK, BBC Radio 1 and 2 did not playlist the single. Alex Jones-Donnely, head of music programming for BBC Radio 1 claimed that the audience would not be able to 'connect' with the Human League's new single adding that it was too 'retro'. It was also claimed that with Oakey in his late 40s and the girls (Susan Sulley and Joanne Catherall) both 39, the group didn't meet Radio 1's demographic target audience of teenagers and 20-somethings. Philip Oakey responded that \\"it was their station, they can play what they want\\". The single was finally released on 23 July 2001, but most stores in the UK didn't get the single on the first day of release and fans reported problems obtaining it. Despite this, midweek chart figures had the single down as a hit within the top 30 but as limited stocks sold out - the single dropped. The distribution chaos sealed the single's fate and the single scraped into the UK charts at number 47, it remained at the lower end of the charts for a further two weeks before disappearing. It was the first time that the premier track from a Human League studio album had failed to make the top 20. Philip Oakey defended Papillon Records against criticisms, responding that the label had spent much time, effort and money on the recording of Secrets, but privately the band were devastated. Oakey spoke of his regret on the single, saying: \\"We're kicking ourselves for not working harder on that first single. We ended up going with a trendy promo agency whose only strategy was to get us on Radio 1. We got a really nice midweek chart position but didn't have the impact that we would have done if we'd followed up by doing Lorraine Kelly or This Morning after that, so it didn't come off.\\" Reception The Times wrote: \\"Yep, They're back. And, yes, very little has changed, which is good news because there wasn't much wrong with the Human League's pop prototype in the first place. Metallic beats, burping electronica, simple melodies and the playful interplay between Phil Oakey's sonorous baritone and Joanne and Susanne's girly voices are present and correct.\\" Track listings =12\\" Vinyl= *A1 \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" (Oliver Lieb's Main Mix) 7:41 *A2 \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" (Oliver Lieb's Alternative Mix) 7:10 *B1 \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" (The Vanity Case Mix) 6:02 *B2 \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" (The Vanity Case Instrumental Mix) 5:59 =CD 1= # \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" (Dave Bascombe Album Mix) 3:32 # \\"Tranquility\\" 3:28 # \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" (Vanity Case Mix) 6:02 =CD 2= # \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" (Original Mix) 3:55 # \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" (Oliver Lieb Main Mix) 7:41 # \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" (Video) 3:33 4 Versions Two main versions of the song exist: * The original version, which features on CD2 and their 2003 greatest hits compilation. * The album version, remixed by Dave Bascombe, which is faster and features much more instrumentation than the sparse original version. Music video Susan Ann Sulley in music video for \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" The music video was filmed on a moderate budget on a small studio set. The theme has as its influence the film 2001: A Space Odyssey. This fit in with the modern-sounding track and its obvious year of release. In keeping with the promotional videos from the Octopus album, there is no storyline. Only Oakey, Sulley and Catherall appear, all dressed in black against a futuristic white set. As the band's age was a contentious issue, the standard filmmakers' technique of making the band appear younger by the use of bright lighting and high exposure is applied. This worked well for the darker complexions of Oakey and Catherall, but the lighter skin and blonde hair of Sulley made her appear over exposed throughout the video. The overall result however was a modern- looking professional music video which would have been acceptable to the various music television channels.

It was hosted by Bob Goen and announced by Jonathan Coleman. Four contestants competed in a stunt game show taped at various shopping malls for a chance at $2,000 in mall money. The first week's shows of Born Lucky were taped at the Glendale Galleria in California. The show aired on Lifetime from October 5, 1992, to April 2, 1993. After the last episode aired, the show went into reruns on the same network from July 5 to December 31, 1993. For a brief period in 2000, PAX TV aired reruns of this series. The show was loosely based on a 1989 British game show of the same name hosted by Jeremy Beadle. Format Each player had a chance to win up to $100 (in what was referred to as \\"mall money\\") in the first round by participating in a stunt, such as trying to follow a sequence of commands, moving an item through a maze using a magnet held in the mouth in 60 seconds, or solving a series of brain teasers. Each stunt had five or ten parts and the contestant earned $10 or $20 for a fraction of success. The top two highest scoring players moved on to Round 2. Regardless of the outcome of the round, all contestants received a prize chosen blindly from a set of cards that were fanned out. If there was a tie (for last place, or if all tied), each person picked an envelope containing \\"mall money\\" not counting toward their scores. The player(s) who picked the most cash went on to round two. =Challenge Round= In the second round, the two remaining players bid against each other to see who could accomplish the stunt (√† la Name That Tune's Bid-a-Note round). All stunts were played in either a 30, 45, or 60-second time limit. If the person accomplished the stunt before time ran out, he or she won. Otherwise, the opponent moved on. =Bonus Round= The winning player then got a chance to win a total of $2,000 (including tiebreaker winnings, if any) by accomplishing a series of 5 additional stunts in 90 seconds. They could pass on only one stunt and if time permitted, they went back to that stunt and he/she had to complete that remaining stunt to win the $2,000 in cash; otherwise, he/she received $100 for each stunt accomplished.

They relocated to Brisbane in 1992. Their 1998 single, \\"Sich √ñffnen\\", was listed on radio station Triple J's Hottest 100. Their debut album, Sand on Seven (September 1998), won the Best Alternative Release category at the ARIA Music Awards in 1999. Not from There's sound was characterised by grinding bass lines, fuzzed-out guitar riffs and occasional usage of dubs or samples.  1991‚Äì97: Early history Not from There was founded in 1991 by Austrian-born guitarist and vocalist, Heinz Riegler, who had met two Australian expat musicians in London, drummer Simon Lambert and bass guitarist Anthony Hills and together they formed a trio. Initially working as the Rubber Dolls, they recorded material in London. According to Riegler their first gig was in February 1991, \\"at the Mean Fiddler in London, it was a Tuesday night. Nobody was there. I took acid and forgot how to play. It went down a treat. Possibly the best show we have ever done.\\" The name, Not from There, relates to all three members as immigrants who have been deported to their home countries at one time or another. They have issued four extended plays; two early ones were a six-track CD, Conned, released in 1991 on Trinity in the United Kingdom, and an eight-track cassette, Wooden Polished Floors released in 1992 on the same label. At this time both Australians, Hills and Lambert, were deported from UK, with Riegler following, to Brisbane. A seven-track CD was released in September 1994, Valid to 06/95, on Malignant Records, an independent record label. In 1995 Riegler was deported from Australia to Austria but returned in the following year. Not from There, a self-titled five-track EP, followed in October 1997 on Infectious Records. It had been recorded at Brisbane's Sunshine Studios in July, with Magoo (Regurgitator, Automatic, Custard) producing for Mushroom Records.  1998‚Äì99: Sand on Seven A three-track single, \\"What Is Better?\\", was released by Not from There in May 1998 via Infectious/Mushroom, which Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, felt showed, \\"jarring rock, with slabs of guitar and industrial strength samples\\" and \\"was certainly the dark and dangerous flipside to the radio-friendly sounds.\\" It was followed by a second single, \\"Sich √ñffnen\\" (English: \\"Open Yourself\\"), in August, which is mostly sung in Riegler's native Austrian German. The track was broadcast on indie- based radio stations and received heavy rotation on national radio broadcaster, Triple J. It was listed on the Triple J Hottest 100, 1998. Their Infectious Records releases were later distributed by Sony. Their debut album, Sand on Seven, was released in September and was produced by Magoo, again. It received critical success and moderate commercial success. AllMusic's Tom Schulte rated it as three-out-of-five stars and explained, \\"[they] landed upon a relentlessly stable form of noisy indie pop that instrumentally is all about rhythm. Any melody is understated, even vocally. Maybe it is just overcompensation on their part.\\" Alex Steininger of In Music We Trust rated it as an A, he observed, \\"[their] sound is best described as out-of-this-world rock music that is original and noisy, which is what you should be looking for in your so-called 'rock' music today.\\" Sand on Seven won the ARIA Award for Best Adult Alternative Album in 1999. The group were also nominated for Breakthrough Artist ‚Äì Album, Breakthrough Artist ‚Äì Single and Magoo was nominated for Producer of the Year for his work on the album. A follow up single, \\"Juanita's Cocktail Party\\", was released in January 1999, and despite having a music video, it failed to achieve the chart success of its predecessor.  2000‚Äì01: Latvian Lovers Not from There provided a cover version of Supernaut's \\"I Like It Both Ways\\" for the soundtrack of Australian feature film, Sample People (May 2000). McFarlane opined that it is, \\" a brooding cover\\" of the original's 1976 \\"glam rock apotheosis.\\" They released their second album, Latvian Lovers, on 12 September 2000, which was produced by Magoo for Festival Mushroom Records. It provided a more disco or funk- oriented feel than their earlier material and managed to sound more accessible, however it failed to gain the critical success of the previous album. It evolved on the electronic side of the first album throughout. Adam Gould of Woroni opined, \\"[it is] a big departure from earlier Not from There material. Gone are the layers of distortion and feedback, in their place are sequencers and synthesiser. Despite the change in approach and instrument the band have generally kept the same feel to their music.\\" Mediasearchs Peter Peterson felt, \\"[it] has a melancholy, almost desperate feel. Built on mostly slow-middle tempo beats, it has definite European influences.\\" Australian music journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, declared it his Album of the Week in February 2001 and explained, \\"a diverse collection of music which evokes the pop groove of Regurgitator or Max Q, the irreverence of TISM, the rock/dance balance of a New Order, and the technology generated focus of an Aphex Twin.\\" Its first single, \\"Frisco Disco\\", was released in January 2001 but had limited commercial success although it was used on the soundtrack of Australian TV drama, The Secret Life of Us. Oz Music Projects Nick Coppack described the track, \\"The fast paced electro insanity of current single 'Frisco Disco' is frighteningly reminiscent of The Bee Gees, especially with Riegler's playful high-pitched vocals.\\" Not from There broke up in 2001. Riegler, in June 2017, told Dan Condon of Double J, \\"Much of the friendships and camaraderie had corroded over the last few years of that band.\\" Post break up Heinz Riegler continued to work on a variety of projects, he collaborated with Lawrence English and Tam Patton in the experimental, ambient, noise outfit I/O3 which issued two recordings on English's Room 40 label. Simon Lambert joined Japanese group, Zoobombs; he toured and recorded with the group from 2003 to 2004. In July 2008, Riegler was short-listed for the Grant McLennan Memorial Fellowship, a Queensland Government Initiative created in honour of the late The Go-Betweens founder.

Despite Roman Catholic leanings at a time when it was illegal not to subscribe to Church of England beliefs and practices, he was highly esteemed for his musical abilities and held posts at St Paul's Cathedral and, it is believed, Westminster Abbey. His output included both sacred and secular music in forms such as consort music, keyboard pieces, madrigals and motets. Life and career From Peerson's will and the March marriage registers, it appears that he was the son of Thomas and Margaret Peerson of March, Cambridgeshire, in England. It is believed that Martin Peerson was born in the town of March between 1571 and 1573, as records show that his parents married in 1570, but a \\"Margaret Peersonn\\" was married in 1573.. It therefore seems that Thomas Peerson died a few years after 1570 and that Martin's mother remarried. Old St. Paul's Cathedral from the south, as it appeared between 1630 and 1666 In the 1580s, Peerson was a choirboy of St. Paul's Cathedral in London under organist Thomas Mulliner.. Subsequently, he came under the patronage of the poet Fulke Greville. On May Day in 1604 Peerson's setting of the madrigal See, O See, Who is Heere Come a Maying was performed as part of Ben Jonson's Private Entertainment of the King and Queene at the house of Sir William Cornwallis at Highgate (now in London). A letter dated 7 December 1609 states that at the time Peerson was living at Newington (now Stoke Newington, London) and had composed several lessons for the virginals, which was his principal instrument. It appears that he had Roman Catholic sympathies, for that year, on the same occasion as Jonson, he was convicted of recusancy ‚Äì the statutory offence of not complying with the established Church of England. Peerson then took up musical studies at the University of Oxford. In order to do so, he would have had to subscribe to Protestantism. In 1613, he was conferred a Bachelor of Music (B.Mus.) and was appointed Master of the Boys of Canterbury Cathedral. It is possible that he was the \\"Martin Pearson\\" who was sacrist at Westminster Abbey from 1623 to 1630. Between June 1624 and June 1625 he returned to St. Paul's Cathedral as almoner and Master of the Choristers; there is also some evidence suggesting he was later made a petty canon. Although all cathedral services ceased at the end of 1642 following the outbreak of the English Civil War, he retained the title of almoner and, along with the other petty canons and the vicars choral, had special financial provision made for him. Peerson is known to have been buried on 16 January 1651 in St. Faith's Chapel under St. Paul's.There is no extant memorial to Peerson in St. Paul's Cathedral. The Cathedral was destroyed in the Great Fire of London of 1666 and subsequent demolition effaced most evidence on the ground of pre-Fire burials; Peerson's is not among the few remaining fragments of monuments: personal e-mail communication on 11 May 2007 with Joseph Wisdom, Librarian of St. Paul's Cathedral Library. He therefore died in either December 1650 or, more likely, January 1651. In spite of his Roman Catholic leanings, evidenced by the use of pre-Reformation Latin texts for his motets and his 1606 conviction for recusancy, Peerson's position at the heart of the Anglican establishment confirms the overall esteem in which he was held.. Music virginal, probably English, c. 1750, from Frederick Litchfield's Illustrated History of Furniture from the Earliest to the Present Time (1892?). Peerson's keyboard music would probably have been played on such an instrument. Peerson's powerful patrons enabled him to print and publish a considerable quantity of his music, although little remains today.. The only four extant keyboard pieces ‚Äì \\"Alman\\", \\"The Fall of the Leafe\\", \\"Piper's Paven\\" and \\"The Primerose\\" ‚Äì appear in the Fitzwilliam Virginal Book (c. 1609 ‚Äì c. 1614), one of the most important sources of early keyboard music containing 298 pieces from the late Elizabethan and early Jacobean periods. He also set to music some of William Leighton's verses, written by the latter while in prison for debt. Together with works by other composers, these were published as The Teares and Lamentatacions of a Sorrowfull Soule in 1614. This was followed two years later by Tristiae Remedium, with texts assembled by the Reverend Thomas Myriell mainly using psalm texts in the English language.. In 1620 Peerson's collection Private Musicke was published.. It contained secular music, including madrigals and consort songs, for one or two voices accompanied by viols or virginals. He published some metrical psalter tunes in Thomas Ravenscroft's 1621 work The Whole Booke of Psalmes with the Hymnes Evangelicall and Songs Spirituall, and then a group of Motets or Grave Chamber Musique in 1630 with English texts and the then-fashionable keyboard continuo;. the latter work contains two very fine songs of mourning. Thereafter, despite changing musical trends, Peerson's music showed significant roots in Renaissance polyphony. However, he was adept in the use of then-modern compositional procedures; this is evident in his often daring use of chromaticism, especially seen in word painting. Some of his finest music is contained in his set of 15 Latin motets, which was probably composed around the turn of the century. Existing only in a single copy, it originally consisted of five part-books but the Cantus book is lost. Richard Rastall, professor of historical musicology at the University of Leeds, spent 12 years reconstructing the missing part. The complete Latin motets have been published by Antico Edition, and a recording of their performance by Ex Cathedra entitled Peerson: Latin Motets was produced by Hyperion Records in 2005..

A great warrior and leader among his people (the brutal and mirthless Tharks), he possesses a sense of compassion and empathy uncharacteristic of his race. In the first novel, A Princess of Mars, with the help of the newly arrived Earth man John Carter, he becomes Jeddak, or king, of the Tharks. Tarkas is the first Barsoomian John Carter encounters when he appears on Mars. When Tarkas discovers Carter inspecting the Tharks' incubator (in which the tribe's eggs are sealed for up to five years prior to hatching), he attempts to kill Carter. The attempt fails, and Tarkas instead takes Carter prisoner and transports him back to the nearby dead city, in which a group of Tharks have taken up temporary residence. When Carter kills one of the Tharks in combat, Tarkas informs him he has gained his opponent's rank and possessions. Over the course of the next weeks, Carter comes to respect Tarkas for his abilities as a warrior and statesman. Carter also discovers that Tarkas has a secret: long ago he fell in love and had a child (egg) with his lover, Gozava, two actions punishable by death in the Tharks' culture. Tarkas and Gozava hid the egg and incubated it in secret. Tarkas was ordered away on a long military expedition, and when the child finally hatched, Gozava managed to mingle her child with the newborn children from the communal incubator. Gozava's maternity (although not the child's identity) was discovered, and she was tortured and killed by the Tharkian chieftain Tal Hajus for the crime of childbearing. However, even under torture she refused to reveal the name of the child's father. The daughter's name is Sola, and she befriends Carter and tells him the story of her birth and the identity of her father. When he learns this, Carter's sympathy and admiration for Tarkas increases, and he resolves to do all he can to help. Over time, the two become friends, and Carter, after escaping the Tharks in the course of his pursuit of Dejah Thoris, returns to them and helps engineer a duel between Tarkas and Tal Hajus, the Jeddak of Thark. Tarkas wins the duel, and according to Tharkian law becomes Jeddak. In exchange for Carter's help, Tarkas becomes one of Carter's closest allies. He appears in a number of the other novels in the series.

The weapon, which was built by Colt, entered service in 1942. It was used in the Bell P-39 Airacobra and P-63 Kingcobra. Design In Finnish museum Designed primarily as an anti-aircraft weapon, the gun had a muzzle velocity of and a cyclic rate of 150 rounds per minute. It was normally loaded with high- explosive shells, but could also be loaded with the M80 armor-piercing shell, which could penetrate 1 inch (25 mm) of armor plate at . It was magazine-fed and could be fired manually or by remote control through a solenoid mounted on the rear of the gun. Recoil and counter-recoil were controlled hydraulically by means of a piston and spring combination connected to the recoiling mechanism and operating in an oil-filled recuperator cylinder mounted to the stationary trunnion block assembly. The recoiling mechanism of the gun included the tube and tube extension, recuperator piston and piston rod, lock frame assembly, driving spring assemblies, and the breechblock assembly. The nonrecoiling parts included the trunnion block group, the feed box and feeding mechanism, the recuperator cylinder and bushing, the back plate group, and the manual charger assembly. Feeding mechanism As the gun was originally designed, ammunition could be fed by a 5-round clip, a 15-round link belt, or a non-disintegrating 30-round endless belt magazine.

The 30-round endless belt magazine was given the designation M6; it had an oval-shaped framework (nicknamed a \\"horsecollar magazine\\" from its shape) providing a track for the endless belt. Firing cycle Initial loading and cocking of the gun were accomplished manually. A safety feature incorporated in the design of the trigger mechanism prevented firing the round until the breech-block assembly was in the battery position. The breech was locked and unlocked by recoil action which brings the operating level guide pins against cams to raise and lower the breechblock. The function of the breechblock was to assist in the final chambering of the round, close the breech, and actuate the trigger trip. It also provided a mounting for the firing pin. The lock frame was retracted by recoil action during automatic firing and is forced forward by the driving springs. The major function of the lock frame assembly was to force the cartridge into the chamber, actuate the breech block, fire the round by means of the hammer striking the firing pin, extract the cartridge case from the chamber, and operate the ejector. The back plate assembly, by absorbing the energy of the lock frame, reduced the shock against the carrier pin as the lock frame was hatched to the rear. The driving spring assemblies held the lock frame against the carrier dog until the carrier was released by carrier catch which was pivoted by the incoming round. The springs then drove the lock frame assembly forward to operate the ejector, chamber the round and raise the breech block. Initial extraction occurred during recoil. Extraction, ejection, feeding and loading were accomplished during counter- recoil. If the trigger was held in the firing position, the gun would continue to fire automatically until the magazine was empty. US Army Air Forces P-39Q Airacobra weapons bay showing M4 cannons \\"horse-collar\\" drum magazine The 37 mm cannon was disliked by pilots for its low muzzle velocity, resulting in more pronounced drop than other contemporary weapons. The only standard aircraft armed with the M4 to see service were the Bell P-39 Airacobra and the derivative P-63 Kingcobra. It was used as a limited standard aircraft in North Africa and the Pacific theater by the USAAF and Allied air forces. The experimental XP-58 \\"Chain Lightning\\" was a larger, more heavily armed version of the P-38 Lightning equipped with quadruple M4 cannons instead of M2 heavy machine guns in its nose. Its original purpose (like the German Bf 110) was to destroy formations of bombers, but it was later re-envisioned as a ground- attack plane. The more pronounced ballistic trajectory was unfamiliar for American pilots, and the four M4s were replaced with a single 75mm M5 cannon and a pair of .50 heavy machine guns.

M4 at Wright Patterson The M4 37 mm (1.46 in) automatic cannon was mounted on numerous U.S. Navy PT boats as deck guns, beginning with the Solomon Islands campaign. Primary targets were the landing barges being used to move supplies down the island chain at night. At first, they were cannibalized from crashed P-39s at Henderson Field, and due to their success as an anti-barge weapon were used for the rest of the war. The M4s were initially mounted on a simple pedestal mount (often built at the front lines) with the standard horseshoe endless-belt feed being used. Later, an improved pedestal mount was designed for original equipment mountings on the boats. Handgrips of several configurations were used with various sights being tried. Most PT boat gunners used tracers to sight the fall of their shot. Beginning in 1944, the M9 model 37 mm (1.46 in) cannon was installed at the builders' boatyard as standard equipment. Soviet Air Forces During World War II the United States supplied the Soviet Air Forces with the M4-equipped P-39 Airacobra and P-63 King Cobra. The U.S did not supply M80 armor-piercing rounds for these Lend- Lease aircraft‚Äîinstead, the Soviets received 1,232,991 M54 high-explosive rounds. The M4 was sometimes used against soft ground targets but was primarily for air-to-air combat on the Eastern Front at which duty it was highly effective. The Soviets did not use the P-39 for tank-busting. Soviet pilots appreciated the M4's reliability but complained of its low rate of fire (three rounds per second) and small magazine size (30 rounds).Drabkin, Artem.

US-built contemporaries and successors * The 37 mm M9 autocannon was a derivative of the 37 mm M1A2 flak gun and used the longer, more powerful 37√ó223mmSR cartridge. Compared to the M4, the M9 had 50% more muzzle velocity (3,000 fps) from a 78-inch barrel (vs. 65-inch in M4), and was twice as heavy (120 vs. 55 pounds for the barrel alone); the whole M9 weighted 405 pounds vs. 213 of the M4. The cyclic rate was the same.George Chinn 1951, The Machine Gun: Development During World War II and Korean Conflict by the United States and their Allies of Full Automatic Machine Gun Systems and High Rate of Fire Power Driven Cannon, Volume III, Parts VIII and IX., p. 352 Little is known about this gun's deployment; the only confirmed use is in the US Navy PT boats mentioned above. * The 37 mm M10 autocannon was a minor improvement of the M4. It was fed by metallic disintegrating link belt and had a slightly higher rate of fire at around 165 rpm. The M10 replaced the M4 in aircraft starting with the A-9 model of the Bell P-63 Kingcobra. The disintegrating link belt made it possible to increase ammunition storage in the Bell P-63 Kingcobra from 30 rounds to 58 rounds.

HIPIMS utilises extremely high power densities of the order of kW‚ãÖcm‚àí2 in short pulses (impulses) of tens of microseconds at low duty cycle (on/off time ratio) of < 10%. Distinguishing features of HIPIMS are a high degree of ionisation of the sputtered metal and a high rate of molecular gas dissociation which result in high density of deposited films. The ionization and dissociation degree increase according to the peak cathode power. The limit is determined by the transition of the discharge from glow to arc phase. The peak power and the duty cycle are selected so as to maintain an average cathode power similar to conventional sputtering (1‚Äì10 W‚ãÖcm‚àí2). HIPIMS is used for: *adhesion enhancing pretreatment of the substrate prior to coating deposition (substrate etching) *deposition of thin films with high microstructure density An extensive and significant overview of many aspects regarding HiPIMS was presented by several authors.  HIPIMS plasma discharge  HIPIMS plasma is generated by a glow discharge where the discharge current density can reach several A‚ãÖcm‚àí2, whilst the discharge voltage is maintained at several hundred volts. The discharge is homogeneously distributed across the surface of the cathode (target) however above a certain threshold of current density it becomes concentrated in narrow ionization zones that move along a path known as the target erosion \\"racetrack\\". HIPIMS generates a high density plasma of the order of 1013 ions‚ãÖcm‚àí3 containing high fractions of target metal ions. The main ionisation mechanism is electron impact, which is balanced by charge exchange, diffusion, and plasma ejection in flares. The ionisation rates depend on the plasma density. The ionisation degree of the metal vapour is a strong function of the peak current density of the discharge. At high current densities, sputtered ions with charge 2+ and higher ‚Äì up to 5+ for V ‚Äì can be generated. The appearance of target ions with charge states higher than 1+ is responsible for a potential secondary electron emission process that has a higher emission coefficient than the kinetic secondary emission found in conventional glow discharges. The establishment of a potential secondary electron emission may enhance the current of the discharge. HIPIMS is typically operated in short pulse (impulse) mode with a low duty cycle in order to avoid overheating of the target and other system components. In every pulse the discharge goes through several stages: *electrical breakdown *gas plasma *metal plasma *steady state, which may be reached if the metal plasma is dense enough to effectively dominate over the gas plasma. The negative voltage (bias voltage) applied to the substrate influences the energy and direction of motion of the positively charged particles that hit the substrate. The on-off cycle has a period on the order of milliseconds. Because the duty cycle is small (< 10%), only low average cathode power is the result (1‚Äì10 kW). The target can cool down during the \\"off time\\", thereby maintaining process stability.Werner K√∂lker: Higher flexibility in coating design PDF. In: CemeCon Facts. Nr. 36, S. 14‚Äì15. The discharge that maintains HIPIMS is a high-current glow discharge, which is transient or quasistationary. Each pulse remains a glow up to a critical duration after which it transits to an arc discharge. If pulse length is kept below the critical duration, the discharge operates in a stable fashion indefinitely. Initial observations by fast camera imaging in 2008 were recorded independently, demonstrated with better precision, and confirmed demonstrating that most ionization processes occur in spatially very limited ionization zones. The drift velocity was measured to be of the order of 104 m/s, which is about only 10% of the electron drift velocity. Substrate pretreatement by HIPIMS Substrate pretreatment in a plasma environment is required prior to deposition of thin films on mechanical components such as automotive parts, metal cutting tools and decorative fittings. The substrates are immersed in a plasma and biased to a high voltage of a few hundred volts. This causes high energy ion bombardment that sputters away any contamination. In cases when the plasma contains metal ions, they can be implanted into the substrate to a depth of a few nm. HIPIMS is used to generate a plasma with a high density and high proportion of metal ions. When looking at the film-substrate interface in cross-section, one can see a clean interface. Epitaxy or atomic registry is typical between the crystal of a nitride film and the crystal of a metal substrate when HIPIMS is used for pretreatment. HIPIMS has been used for the pretreatment of steel substrates for the first time in February 2001 by A.P. Ehiasarian. Substrate biasing during pretreatment uses high voltages, which require purpose-designed arc detection and suppression technology. Dedicated DC substrate biasing units provide the most versatile option as they maximize substrate etch rates, minimise substrate damage, and can operate in systems with multiple cathodes. An alternative is the use of two HIPIMS power supplies synchronised in a master‚Äìslave configuration: one to establish the discharge and one to produce a pulsed substrate bias Thin-film deposition by HIPIMS The figure shows the surface topography and structure of the HiPIMS FerroCon tool coating by CemeCon AG on a carbide substrate, magnified under an electron microscope. Thin films deposited by HIPIMS at discharge current density > 0.5 A‚ãÖcm‚àí2 have a dense columnar structure with no voids. The deposition of copper films by HIPIMS was reported for the first time by V. Kouznetsov for the application of filling 1 ¬µm vias with aspect ratio of 1:1.2 Transition metal nitride (CrN) thin films were deposited by HIPIMS for the first time in February 2001 by A.P. Ehiasarian. The first thorough investigation of films deposited by HIPIMS by TEM demonstrated a dense microstructure, free of large scale defects. The films had a high hardness, good corrosion resistance and low sliding wear coefficient. The commercialisation of HIPIMS hardware that followed made the technology accessible to the wider scientific community and triggered developments in a number of areas. = Reactive HiPIMS = Similarly to what is witnessed in conventional reactive sputter deposition process, HiPIMS has also been used to attain oxide or nitride-based films on several substrates, as is seen in the list below. However, as it is characteristic of these methods, the performance of such depositions has significant hysteresis and need to be carefully examined to inspect the optimal operation points. Significant overviews of reactive HiPIMS were published by A. Anders and Kubart et al.. = Deposition Examples = The following materials have, among others, been deposited successfully by HIPIMS: *Corrosion Resistant: CrN/NbN nanoscale multilayer *Oxidation Resistant: CrAlYN/CrN nanoscale multilayer, Ti-Al-Si-N, Cr-Al-Si-N nanocomposite *Optical: Ag, TiO2, ZnO, InSnO, ZrO2, CuInGaSe *MAX phases: TiSiC *Microelectronics: Cu, Ti, TiN, Ta, TaN * Hard Coatings: carbon nitride CNx, Ti‚ÄìC nanocomposite * Hydrophobic: HfO2 Industrial application HIPIMS has been successfully applied for the deposition of thin films in industry, particularly on cutting tools. The first HIPIMS coating units appeared on the market in 2006. The gold version of the Apple iPhone 12 Pro uses this process on the structural stainless steel band that also serves as the device's antenna system. Advantages The main advantages of HIPIMS coatings include a denser coating morphologyStephan Bolz: . In: CemeCon Facts. Nr. 35, S. 11‚Äì12. and an increased ratio of hardness to Young's modulus compared to conventional PVD coatings. Whereas comparable conventional nano-structured (Ti,Al)N coatings have a hardness of 25 GPa and a Young's modulus of 460 GPa, the hardness of the new HIPIMS coating is higher than 30 GPa with a Young's modulus of 368 GPa. The ratio between hardness and Young's modulus is a measure of the toughness properties of the coating. The desirable condition is high hardness with a relatively small Young's modulus, such as can be found in HIPIMS coatings. Recently, innovative applications of HIPIMS coated surfaces for biomedical applications were reported by Rtimi et al.

The town is located on the northern shore of the inner lobe of the Bay of C√°diz, on the site of the ancient Roman settlement of Portus Gaditanus. An ancient trading post, it is probably the oldest settlement on the Bay of C√°diz. It owes its modern name to the fact that it was rebuilt in 1488 by Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile. Puerto Real boasts public squares and broad streets; it also has a town-hall building and a 16th- century church, which was constructed in several styles (Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque). Geography The town of Puerto Real has two separate zones with two separate characters, a maritime zone and a hinterland zone. Central Puerto Real lies entirely within the maritime zone, facing, as it does, the Bay of Cadiz and the Atlantic Ocean beyond. The inland zone, the so-called hinterland, is far larger in area but far less populated. Puerto Real borders the towns and cities of San Fernando to the southwest, Chiclana de la Frontera to the south, Medina Sidonia to the southeast, Jerez de la Frontera to the north and northeast, and El Puerto de Santa Maria to the northwest. A good portion of the periphery of Puerto Real lies within the Bay of C√°diz Natural Reserve, an area known for its salt marshes; the reeds of the marshes are the raw material for weaving mats that form the walls of cages in fish-farming enterprises (pisciculture). These wetlands, composed of lagoons as well as salt marshes, welcome, in the spring and autumn, huge flocks of migratory birds en route to their new seasonal homes. Also, on the outskirts of Puerto Real, there are several notable pine forests, among them, Las Canteras (the Forest of Quarries) and La Algaida (Mare's Meadow Forest). Because of its forests and estuarine marshes, Puerto Real is sometimes called the \\"green lung\\" of the Bay of C√°diz. The San Pedro river, an arm of the Guadalete river, flows along the northwestern edge of the town, separating Puerto Real from neighboring El Puerto de Santa Maria. Puerto Real is united to C√°diz by the Jos√© Le√≥n de Carranza Bridge, named for a former mayor of C√°diz. As of 2007, a second bridge was planned. Other aspects of Puerto Real's geography are the many kilometers of gorges, ravines, and artificially created footpaths that traverse the municipality. Among them is a long green corridor, constituting one end of the Two Bays Trail that unites the two large bays of the province of C√°diz, the Bay of C√°diz and the Bay of Algeciras. There are also two concentrations of population within the municipal limits of Puerto Real that are not contiguous with the central part of the city; they are called the District of Jarana and the District of the San Pedro (river). History Although the city was founded in 1483 by the Catholic Monarchs, the actual history of Puerto Real begins in pre-Roman antiquity. There are vestiges of both prehistoric and Roman settlements in Puerto Real that bear witness to the fact that the land on which the modern city is sited has been inhabited for a very long time. Puerto Real is the site of the ancient Roman settlement of Portus Gaditanus, meaning \\"The Port of Gades\\", the maritime appendage of the Roman colonia, Gades (C√°diz), across the narrow end of the bay. The Spanish monarchs decided to build a new \\"royal\\" port city on this site because they wished to become personally involved in the lucrative trade that had developed with North Africa. Powerful nobles already dominated all of the other ports of western Andalusia (C√°diz, Huelva, and, to a lesser extent, Seville). From the time of its founding, Puerto Real's prosperity was closely tied to the fortunes of these other Spanish ports, especially C√°diz, which soon grew rich from its commerce with America. In 1820, there was a popular liberal revolt in Spain, led by the constitutionalist and patriot, Rafael del Riego y Nunez (1785‚Äì1823), that sought to reinstate the liberal constitution that had been proclaimed in 1812. This revolt led to the imprisonment of King Ferdinand VII in C√°diz and the convening of the liberal Cortes in that city. An international conference of monarchist powers, the Congress of Verona, in October 1822, deputized France to secure Ferdinand's release and restore absolutism in Spain. The invading French army, known as the Hundred Thousand Children of St. Louis (France's patron saint), took Madrid, and, on 7 April 1823, laid siege to C√°diz from positions in Puerto Real and nearby San Fernando. Initially, French artillery barrages failed to cause the fall of the city. Riego's forces held the strategic Fort San Luis on the island of Trocadero at the extreme south end of the Bay of C√°diz, between C√°diz and Puerto Real. When the fort's defenders succumbed to a French assault on 31 August 1823, Trocadero was lost, and so, in effect, was the liberal cause. The remaining defenders of C√°diz, smarting from their loss at the Battle of Trocadero and despairing of the possibility of reinforcement, sued for peace. They made an agreement that resulted in the release and reinstatement of Ferdinand VII. In exchange, the liberals secured promises of an amnesty for their fighters and for the members of the dissident Cortes; the agents of the king also agreed to the establishment of a form of constitutional monarchy where the principles of the 1812 constitution were supposed to be respected. In the process of besieging C√°diz, the French succeeded in destroying a large part of Puerto Real, including its water delivery and sanitation systems. Perhaps it was because of these events that Puerto Real was regularly beset by epidemics throughout much of the 19th century. Another reminder in Puerto Real of the time of the French invasion is the Cortadura canal that allows passage across the base of the peninsula of C√°diz. The canal is not a natural waterway; it was constructed by the Spanish in an attempt to prevent the French artillery from drawing closer to the walls of the city. At the end of the 19th century, Puerto Real experienced an industrial boom, thanks to the creation of modern shipyards by Antonio L√≥pez. New technological advances and the new industries drastically modified the appearance of Puerto Real. To make room for the new shipyards and warehouses, a working-class neighborhood, Matagorda, was leveled, but new neighborhoods, like the River San Pedro and Marquesado districts, sprang up. Economy Playa of the Cap. Puerto Real is a city with an economy based almost exclusively on industry. =Shipbuilding and marine repairs= The shipbuilding industry, for centuries the backbone of the local economy, has experienced serious economic setbacks during the recent 10‚Äì15 years, due to competition from other shipbuilders, mostly in South East Asia. Shipyard industry in Spain and most of Europe has been unable to compete with their Asian counterparts, due to a number of factors, among them economies of scale and more efficient production methods. =Aeronautical fabrication= Unlike the shipbuilding industry, which is in decline, the airplane-building industry is doing well. Airbus operates a factory in Puerto Real responsible for the construction of the tail stabilizer assembly, the rudder, and the belly fairing of the Airbus A380 airplane. The Puerto Real facility is also involved in fabrication of the lateral drawer of the A320 airplane and rudder assemblies for the A330 and the A340. =Auto parts= Puerto Real was the home of a Delphi auto parts plant associated with General Motors. The plant was closed in 2007. =Large-scale construction= Local companies are involved in off-shore dredging. Also, a Puerto Real concern has built one of the largest off-shore natural-gas drilling platforms in the world. =Other industries= Many small and medium-sized companies supply services and manual labor for the other industrial enterprises in the area. The crisis in the shipbuilding industry has had a deleterious effect on these second-tier enterprises. =Economic transformation= Airbus airplanes parts factory. Due to the decline in shipbuilding, Puerto Real has already lost an important part of its industrial base, and the economy of the entire Bay of C√°diz area has suffered. This has resulted in a dramatic shift in the regional economic model, away from a dependence on heavy industry, toward an emphasis on tourism. However, Puerto Real, an industrial community headed toward obsolescence, is not as well-positioned to trade on sunshine and beach sand as some of its neighbors. The transition to a tourism-based economy has proved to be slow and painful. Puerto Real persists in having a high birth-rate, and the age of its average citizen continues to decline. Young people lacking jobs are forced to seek work elsewhere in Spain or even leave the country altogether. Lacking fine beaches, Puerto Real has turned its attention inland. For that reason, the city's efforts at tourism-promotion mainly emphasize \\"rural tourism\\" activities, like golf, horseback-riding, walking, hiking, bicycling, and nature sightseeing. The local countryside has become a prime asset, and now Puerto Real builds hiking paths and golf courses rather than ocean-going tankers. The situation is much the same in other communities of the Bay of C√°diz area, like San Fernando, El Puerto de Santa Maria, and C√°diz itself. Politics Since the time of the transition from dictatorship under Francisco Franco to democracy and a constitutional monarchy form of government (1975‚Äì1980), Puerto Real has remained to the left of the political spectrum. Leftist parties, sometimes in coalition with centrists, have dominated the local and provincial organs of democracy. The anarcho-syndicalist union C.N.T. has helped to create mass assemblies after a dispute between shipyard workers and their bosses. Since then, the assemblies have focused on the issues such as health, taxes, economic issues, the environment and cultural preservation.Anarcho-Syndicalism in Puerto Real: from shipyard resistance to direct democracy and community control This method has been praised as a method of anarchist community organising.

In other countries, the TV show started broadcasting later than 1989 either in its original version or in a dubbed version. By language =Arabic= The show was first broadcast in the area in English with Arabic subtitles on networks like Showtime Arabia and Dubai's One TV, where it received a following in the area. The show was finally dubbed into Arabic in September 2005, under the title \\"Al-Shamshoon\\" (). In addition to being dubbed in Arabic (with subtitles provided for shots including written English, such as the chalkboards), references to alcohol, pork, and numerous other themes have been deleted or significantly modified. For instance, Homer drinks soda-pop instead of beer, eats beef sausages and hot dogs as opposed to pork, while shots of him eating bacon and pork rinds were removed entirely, eats ka'ak instead of donuts, and all references to Moe's Tavern were cut. References to Rabbi Krustofsky, Krusty the Clown's father, were removed as well. According to Richard Poplak of the CBC, an ex-Disney employee in Lebanon told him that, in Poplak's words, \\"if a TV station can help it, they‚Äôll excise references to Judaism from shows meant for the pan-Arab market.\\" Badih Fattouh, MBC 1's acquisitions and drama commissioner head, said, \\"You must understand that we did not simply dub, but we Arabized the concept, and we toned it down a bit. We toned [down] the language ‚Äî we Arabized it in the cultural sense.\\" MBC 1, a company owned by Saudi Arabian sheiks, created the Arabic adaptation. Amr Hosny, a scriptwriter who frequently adapts works for the Arab world, served as the writer. The creative personalities behind Al-Shamshoun were Egyptian. The producers decided to adapt the \\"classic\\" episodes, beginning with Season 4, rather than starting with the original episodes. The characters were also given typical Arabic names such as Omar, Mona, Beesa and Badr for Homer, Marge, Lisa and Bart, respectively, as part of the retooling, while voices were provided by leading actors including Egyptian film star Mohamed Henedi as \\"Omar\\". Their hometown \\"Springfield\\" was called \\"Rabeea\\" (Arabic for spring) and made it look like an American town with a major Arab population. Poplak said, \\"Although Fattouh and MBC will give no figures, the licence fees from 20th Century Fox could not have been cheap.\\" About the original series, Hosny said, \\"I loved it. I take off my chapeau: they are very good artists. And the writers are unbelievable. I loved the character of Homer. There is something very strange about this character. It‚Äôs very close to the Egyptian point of view. He‚Äôs a very simple and kind person; from some points of view you feel that he‚Äôs incredibly stupid, and from some points of view you feel he is wise. Sometimes I felt I was talking about an Egyptian person. Nothing is certain and taken for granted ‚Äî it‚Äôs not ipso facto ‚Äî and this makes good art\\". Hosny said that the sheiks who owned MBC interfered in the creative process, making the show more edited and less comprehensible. For instance, Hosny wanted to make a \\"Little Arab Town\\" where it would be explained why there were many Arab people living in the middle of the United States. The sheiks rejected Hosny's suggestions. Poplak said, \\"Instead, Springfield remained, and there was no coherent explanation given as to why a full Arab community exists within the middle of Middle America\\". Hosny wanted Homer to drink she'er, a non-alcoholic malt drink, so dubbing would be easy. The sheiks insisted that Homer drink juice. Hosny also stated that he tried to underemphasize Waylon Smithers's homosexual attraction for Mr. Burns. Poplak said, \\"Through a steady process of cross-cultural attrition ‚Äî no bacon sandwiches, no Moe‚Äôs Tavern, church becomes masjid (mosque) ‚Äî The Simpsons was whittled down to a shadow of itself.\\" The show debuted after al-Iftar on October 4, 2005, the first night of Ramadan. The show overall had a poor reception. Fattouh said, \\"The show was not a big success. Otherwise, of course, we would have continued to do another season. I would say it was fairly received, but average. This made us reconsider\\". Poplak said, \\"That‚Äôs putting it mildly. MBC‚Äôs core viewers were baffled. From most accounts, the show was incoherent\\". The MBC show had a poor reception in the Saudi Arabian market, described by Poplak as \\"all-important\\". Cartoons in Saudi Arabia are perceived as being for children, and adults, puzzled at why cartoons were airing during the post-Iftar time, chose to watch other channels. Arabs who were fans of The Simpsons also had a negative reaction. As'ad AbuKhalil, a professor at California State University, Stanislaus and a blogger who operates the \\"Angry Arab News Service,\\" () said that after he saw a promotional segment, \\"This is just beyond the pale[.]\\" and \\"It was just painful. ... The guy who played Homer Simpson was one of the most unfunny people I ever watched. Just drop the project, and air reruns of Tony Danza's show instead.\\" Fattouh added \\"You see, culturally, it didn‚Äôt cross very well. Maybe the sense of humour is too North American. Comedy is especially a culturally sensitive matter. What you can define as funny is an outcome of learnings, habits, doings, local behaviour ‚Äî it is the sum of so many factors. Drama is one thing, but with comedy, it is black and white. Deep inside, either you laugh or you say, ‚ÄòNo, this is not funny.‚Äô They did not think this was funny\\". As a result, only 34 of the 52 adapted episodes aired. Poplak said, \\"It is a lesson in cross-cultural adaptation, and a warning of how delicate a powerful piece of television art like The Simpsons actually is.\\" The show in its unedited form currently airs on Fox Series in English with Arabic subtitles. =Czech= The Simpsons (\\"Simpsonovi\\") in Czech is broadcast in the Czech Republic and Slovakia, premiering on January 8, 1993 on ƒåesk√° televize, who broadcast the series until 2010, when the Czech broadcast rights were bought by Prima Cool. The late actress Helena ≈†t√°chov√° provided the voice of Lisa Simpson until 2017; since then, Ivana Korolov√° has voiced Lisa. Popular Czech actor Ji≈ô√≠ L√°bus voices Marge Simpson. Martin Dejdar voices Bart and Vlastimil Bedrna voiced Homer until the 13th season and Vlastimil Zav≈ôel voices him since then. =French= The Simpsons has been dubbed into the French language twice, once in the Canadian province of Quebec and again in France. The show is titled \\"Les Simpson\\" in both regions, following local orthography standards. The French audio on most Region 1 DVDs is the Quebec dub, although very early releases used the European French dub instead. It is one of only a handful of American television shows that have wholly separate versions in Quebec and France, and a number of studies have been made comparing them. In France all the characters speak standard French, with the exception of the ethnic minorities: Apu is given the Portuguese accent, while Carl, who has no accent in the English version, also speaks affected French. Kirk Van Houten is given a stereotypical Brussels accent, as \\"Van Houten\\" is a name which can be assumed to be Belgian. In the Quebec version, only the town √©lite, such as Principal Skinner and Reverend Lovejoy, speak with a French accent. The Simpson family and most of the townsfolk speak with a strong Quebec accent. In the Quebec version the ethnic minorities also have accents. Noticeably, Carl has the accent of a Black immigrant from Haiti. Local idioms are occasionally adopted in place of direct translation. American cultural and political jokes are occasionally replaced with local references. For instance, a reference to Newt Gingrich in Quebec is generally replaced with one to Mike Harris. Most of the recurring characters keep their English names in each French version. Two exceptions are Sideshow Bob and Sideshow Mel, who are known as Tahiti Bob and Tahiti Mel in France, as the word sideshow has no direct translation. In Quebec, the title sideshow is kept as an Anglicism. Another exception is made for the Simpsons family's dog, Santa's Little Helper, who is called \\"Le p'tit renne au nez rouge\\" (the French name for the song \\"Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer\\", which literally means \\"Little Red-Nosed Reindeer\\") in the Quebec version and \\"Petit Papa No√´l\\" (name of a French Christmas song that literally means \\"Little Father Christmas\\") in the French one. In addition, although the location and setting of the show are not changed in the Quebec dub (still takes place in the United States), many references to the characters watching American TV shows, movies, etc. are changed to references to Qu√©b√©cois ones. For example, a reference to Homer watching CSI: Miami in the original was changed to Fortier, a similar Qu√©b√©cois show. Although these changed references would be familiar to the French-Canadian viewer, in real life these would be awkward because almost all Qu√©b√©cois media is unknown in the United States. This is an example of localizing the humour for the Quebec market. In the episode \\"Lisa's Rival\\", Bart's mention of getting Millhouse Van Houten on America's Most Wanted, is simply changed for \\"on television\\". In addition, most instances of the word \\"English\\" are changed to \\"French\\". Due to this, in one episode where Homer visits Canada, the roles of anglophones and francophones are completely reversed, resulting in a stereotypical English-Canadian speaking French and a stereotypical French-Canadian speaking English. In another episode, English- Canadians were given stereotypical American accents speaking French, even when the main characters from the U.S.A. were not. The same practice is done in the Quebec dub of King of the Hill, done by the same company and many of the same actors, but to a greater extent: instead of taking place in Arlen, Texas, the show takes place in Sainte-Ir√®ne, Quebec, and many of the characters' names are changed. However, American and Texas flags along with pictures of Texas state (such as on the side of police cars) are not edited. Generally, names are pronounced according to French pronunciation rules. For example, Milhouse van Houten sounds like Meeloose Vanooten. Marge, the ge is pronouned / í/ instead of /d í/, in Homer, the h is mute. The u in Krusty is pronounced as /≈ì/ as usual in French if words derive from English language such as club. Other names are slightly different such as Edna Krabappel who is named Edna Krapabelle. Unlike in the original version, some names are stressed on the second syllable like Li'Sa, Mag'Gie or Nel'Son. The episodes are dubbed by a team of voice actors, similar to the one that does the original. The team does about two episodes per day. In general these voice actors also do the characters who were voiced by celebrities in the American version. In the French version, on occasion, official dubbers are brought in. For instance, in the episode \\"The Springfield Files\\", where agents Mulder and Scully from The X-Files appear the voice actors who do their voices on the French version of the X-Files guest starred. Up to a certain point, the animation of the show was not changed, and what is written in English appears in English, either subtitled in French or spoken by a character in French, in the two French versions. One important exception is the blackboard joke at the beginning of each episode. While the France version kept the original English, translating in the subtitles, the Quebec version changed the writing on the board directly to French. However, for later episodes of the Quebec version, other text was changed as well, such as movie titles (\\"Cosmic Wars\\" became \\"La guerre de l'espace\\" [Space War] in the episode \\"Co-Dependent's Day\\"). In July 2007 Matt Groening said in an interview on Late Night with Conan O'Brien that the actor (Phillippe Peythieu) who does the voice of France French Homer says \\"T'oh!\\" instead of Homer's trademark \\"D'oh!\\". This comes from the actor misreading the line the first time he did Homer's voice and has been that way ever since. In the France version of the show, many other catch phrases are also translated: Bart's \\"Eat my shorts\\" becomes \\"Va te faire shampouiner\\" (\\"Go shampoo yourself\\", similar to \\"go to hell\\"). When Homer tries to throttle Bart, his phrase \\"Why you little...\\" becomes \\"esp√®ce de sale petit...\\" (literally \\"you dirty lil'...\\"). This version also has its popular catchphrases, to translate some terms that in the original versions are not catchphrases. Thereby, instead of \\"Oh my god!\\", Homer says \\"Ouh pinaise!\\", a deformation of \\"Oh punaise!\\" (Oh darn!), a watered-down form of the expletive \\"Oh putain!\\" (Oh damn!). \\"Oh pinaise!\\" is in French as much essential to characterize Homer as \\"D'oh\\" is in English. Homer is also unable to pronounce some terms like \\"biblioth√®que\\" (library) and says \\"bibilioth√®que\\". These catch phrases are translated in the Canadian French version as well: \\"Eat my shorts\\" becomes \\"mange de la crotte\\" (\\"eat shit\\") while \\"Why you little...\\" becomes \\"mon p'tit verrat\\" (\\"you little brat\\"). G√©rard Rinaldi, who replaced Michel Modo (who died in 2008http://www.simpsonspark.com/dossiers/modo.php and who notably voiced Krusty, Chief Wiggum, Dr Hibbert or Principal Skinner), was himself replaced by Xavier Fagnon after his death in March 2012.http://www.simpsonspark.com/actualites/3008-deces-de-gerard- rinaldi.phphttp://www.simpsonspark.com/doublage.php R√©gine Teyssot voiced nearly every secondary female and child character. =German= Die Simpsons is being broadcast on ProSieben in Germany and on ORF1 in Austria. Until 1994, ZDF broadcast The Simpsons in Germany. The main voices are dubbed by Norbert Gastell for Homer until season 26. After he died in 2015, Christoph Jablonka replaced him from season 27. Marge was dubbed by Elisabeth Volkmann. She died in 2006, Anke Engelke became her successor. The change of the voices took place in the midst of season 17, when Volkmann's last dubbed episode was We're on the Road to D'ohwhere and Engelke's first dubbed episode was My Fair Laddy. Whilst Elisabeth Volkmann's voice is not so close, Anke Engelke's voice is rather \\"adapted\\" to the original voice. Bart is dubbed by Sandra Schwittau and Lisa by Sabine Bohlmann who also dubs Maggie. One major difference is that Homer's \\"D'oh!\\" is yelled as a fierce \\"NEIN!\\" (\\"NO!\\"). Whenever Homer strangles Bart, he says \\"Na warte, du Kleiner ...\\" (\\"Wait you little ...\\") or \\"Du mieser Kleiner ...\\" (\\"You mean little ...\\"). =Italian= I Simpson has been aired in Italy since October 1, 1991. The main voices are by Tonino Accolla (Homer), Li√π Bosisio (Marge), Ilaria Stagni (Bart) and Monica Ward (Lisa). The animation of the show is changed: whenever something written in English appears on screen, the Italian version superimposes the translated phrase. In the initial blackboard scene, Bart reads the phrase translated but the blackboard itself still shows the English words. While all of the character names remain in English, some have been modified, possibly to be easier to understand and recognize as a name to the audience: most notably, Moe became Boe (and all shots of his bar's sign are graphically modified accordingly), Edna Krabappel is named Caprapall, Chief Wiggum is Commissario Winchester and Itchy and Scratchy are replaced by Grattachecca e Fichetto (the first refers to a typical granita sold in Rome. Fichetto is a person who wants to be cool but not in an exaggerated way). All characters having roles in their name (Principal Skinner, Chief Wiggum, Groundskeeper Willie, etc.) or English words (Fat Tony) have received literal translation for their title, with Sideshow (Mel and Bob) becoming Telespalla (the word did not exist in Italian before the show, but it is a good translation since spalla is the role of a sideshow). Many characters are dubbed with strong local accents. In November 2012, Li√π Bosisio and Ilaria Stagni, were replaced by Sonia Scotti (Marge), and Gaia Bolognesi (Bart). Like the French and Spanish version, real and fictional characters conserve their frequent Italian voice, for example in the episode \\"Any Given Sundance\\", Woody Allen (voiced by Hank Azaria), was dubbed by his Italian voice Oreste Lionello who did the last dub of his career, in fact he died a week after the Italian airing. Many characters are voiced by guest stars, like ex-minister Ignazio La Russa who voiced Garth, the sugar industries manager, politician Alessandra Mussolini as Marge's friend Tammy, football player Francesco Totti and his wife, showgirl Ilary Blasi as Buck Mitchell and Tabitha Vixx, showgirl Valeria Marini as Mindy Simmons, Maria Grazia Cucinotta as in the original version is Francesca, sideshow Bob's wife. On July 14, 2013 Tonino Accolla, the voice for Homer Simpson, died on July 14, 2013 and was replaced by Massimo Lopez. In Italian, many other catch phrases are also translated: Bart's \\"Eat my shorts\\" becomes \\"Ciucciati il calzino\\" (\\"Suck the sock\\"). When Homer tries to throttle Bart, his phrase \\"Why you little...\\" becomes \\"Brutto bagarospo...\\" (\\"You ugly frog...\\"). =Luxembourgish= The Simpsons was first broadcast in Luxembourgish in September 2011 on RTL Luxembourg, after many years of being able to watch the show in the more widely spoken French language on French TV. The show is titled D' Simpsons, an abbreviation for De Simpsons. Like the French version, mentions of American culture are often not mentioned such as TV shows not known internationally, while the episodes appear uncut and broadcast in full with the end credits intact. The start sequence sees an onscreen subtitle for the chalk board gags. This version came about after many fans in Luxembourg protested for such a version, although the movie is only available in French and German at present (two of the three official languages of the country). RTL's screening of the show is sponsored by Luxembourg Post. =Spanish= The Simpsons is dubbed into the Spanish language in two versions, one for Spain, and another in Mexico targeted to all Spanish-speaking countries in the Americas. In both versions, the show is named Los Simpson, as last names are pluralized in Spanish using the article rather than the -s suffix (although it's commonly misspelled as \\"Los Simpsons\\"). There are many differences between the two versions, as there are differences between the Spanish spoken in Spain and in Hispanic America. Whereas the dubbing in Spain tends to be more literal and to not translate character names nor toponyms, in the Hispanic American version many of the character names are translated, sometimes freely. Thus, in Hispanic America Homer is translated as Homero Simpson. Other translations in Hispanic America are: Barney Gumble as Barney G√≥mez, Chief Wiggum as Jefe Gorgory, Ralph Wiggum as Ralf/Rafa Gorgory, Reverend Lovejoy as Reverendo Alegr√≠a and Mayor \\"Diamond\\" Joe Quimby as Alcalde Diamante. Itchy and Scratchy are translated in the two versions: Tomy y Daly for Hispanic America, and Rasca y Pica for Spain (however, \\"Pica\\" and \\"Rasca\\" literally translate as \\"It itches\\" and \\"It scratches\\"). Sideshow Bob is Bob Pati√±o in Hispanic America, and Actor secundario Bob in Spain. The animation of the show is not changed, and what is written in English remains in English in the Spanish versions. In the blackboard scene, Bart reads the phrase translated. After the introduction, in the Hispanic American version the Spanish name of the episode is spoken during the television shot by the narrator, while in the Spanish version, it appears subtitled. Texts within the show are usually voiced by a narrator in the Hispanic American version, while they are subtitled in Spain. The region 1 DVDs include the Hispanic American audio. Spanish (Latin America) The Simpsons was first dubbed in Mexico in 1990. The first dubbing studio selected was Audiomaster 3000; in Mexico City. In the list of voice actors chosen was Humberto V√©lez, a recognized voice actor; besides dubbing Homer Simpson, V√©lez was the narrator and translator in the series. The series was adapted to including words and expressions not only Mexican, but of the Americas; such as Chile, Argentina, among anothers. In January 2005, the National Association of Actors opposed a proposal from Grabaciones y Doblajes Internationales (later New Art Dub), the dubbing studio responsible for producing the Hispanic American version, to allow hiring of non-trade actors. That April, V√©lez announced his departure from The Simpsons. In July, from the sixteen season onwards, almost the entire cast was permanently replaced with new actors, who also were unable to dub The Simpsons Movie. The Mexican version, it is common to hear local jokes or expressions, as well as references to Latin American pop-culture. For the Hispanic American version; the local jokes, expressions and words were deleted after the actors' strike, becoming more neutral. Spanish (Spain) The Spanish voice acting is performed in standard Castilian accent. The show is translated to the standard Spanish dialect, accounting for some differences in vocabulary from its Hispanic American counterpart. Regional accents, as would be present in the original English cast (e.g., Willie's Scottish accent) are also dubbed into the standard Castilian accent so as to avoid representing specific Spanish regional accents with the stereotypes associated in English to characters of that accent. Several fans of the series and the rest of the Spanish cast were devastated after the death of Carlos Revilla due to his fame as Homer Simpson, and Antena 3 had to find a substitute for Revilla's voice (as opposed to Dan Castellaneta's).Finally, was chosen Carlos Isbert, a very popular voice actor with a huge career and who had been supporting actor on the Revilla's team, and who is Homer nowadays. Revilla also dubbed the appearance of KITT in the episode \\"The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace\\", like he did in Knight Rider. There are other characters that conserve their frequent voice in Spain: like Mulder and Scully from The X-Files, or Sideshow Bob and his brother Cecil. They are dubbed by the same actors who dub Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce in Frasier. (With Cecil this only occurs in his first appearance.) In the Spanish version of The Simpsons Movie, the Tom Hanks cameo was dubbing by his habitual voice in Spain. In European Spanish, the rest of the family characters are played by Margarita de Francia (Marge), Isacha Meng√≠bar (Lisa) and Sara Vivas (Bart). The Spanish version of The Simpsons also distinguishes itself by using more literal translations of what the characters are saying. Jokes and pop cultural references from the original English version are generally maintained. In 2000, the Spaniard version was awarded the Best Simpsons Dub in Europe by FOX. =Portuguese= In Brazil, The Simpsons is dubbed into Portuguese by Audio News studio in Rio de Janeiro. The voice for Homer/Abe is Carlos Alberto, Marge is Selma Lopes, Lisa is voiced by Flavia Saddy and Bart is voiced by Rodrigo Antas. Some of the name of the characters is adapted to a similar name in Portuguese or translated, when there are words or names in the Portuguese language. For an example the character Gil, his name is pronounced Jil, like the singer Gilberto Gil, for translations: Snowball is called Bola de Neve, and Santa's Little Helper is called Ajudante do Papai Noel. Kwik E 'Mart, the first season is Mercadinho. Homer's friend, Lenny has an accent from the Brazilian northeast. Unlike Brazil, in Portugal, the show is not dubbed, and it airs in its original version with Portuguese subtitles. However, The Simpsons Movie was dubbed, and it is so far the only instance of The Simpsons dubbed into European Portuguese (even though the original version with subtitles also came out in Portuguese theaters). Homer was voiced by Jos√© Jorge Duarte, Marge was voiced by Cl√°udia Cadima, Bart was voiced by Carla de S√°, and Lisa was voiced by Manuela Couto. By country =China= In 2006, The Simpsons, along with other shows such as Pok√©mon, SpongeBob SquarePants and Mickey Mouse cartoons, were banned from being aired during primetime (5:00 to 8:00 PM) in China. This was done so that Chinese cartoons, which were having a hard time competing with foreign cartoons, would gain more viewers. The government had previously tried several things, such as ordering that networks cut down on the number of foreign animated series being aired in 2000 and in 2004, passed a rule that would ensure that 60 percent of cartoon content came from Chinese studios. The move was heavily criticized by Chinese media. The Simpsons Movie, however, has been dubbed into Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese. The show currently airs in Mandarin with some edits. Episodes are typically broadcast 2-3 weeks after its original airdate in the US. = Sweden = The Simpsons appeared for the first time on Swedish television on November 29, 1990. The series was originally broadcast on TV3 in English with Swedish subtitles. However, in 1993, the network decided to start dub The Simpsons to increase ratings, and the show was moved to a more child-friendly time. After a public outrage the dubbing was dropped after only six episodes and the show was moved to a more adult time.Sources from , a non-free online database of Swedish newspaper articles. Articles from Expressen and Dagens Nyheter, autumn 1993. Bart was voiced by Annica Smedius and Homer by Per Sandborgh. A dub of the movie was released with The Simpsons Movie DVD, with Annica Smedius providing the voice for Bart once again. =Hungary= The Simpsons appeared for the first time in Hungary, and it was dubbed into the Hungarian language on TV3 on September 14, 1998. The series was one of the most popular shows on TV3, but this channel closed down on February 21, 2000. As a result, Viasat 3 started to broadcast new episodes starting with season 6 from September 29, 2001. In January 2008, Viasat 3 was ceased to broadcast The Simpsons, and its sister channel, Viasat 6 (then TV6) started to air reruns. In September 2008, Viasat 6 also started to air new episodes. On August 30, 2013,Viasat 6 broadcast the season finale of season 24. On February 4, 2014, the Hungarian version of Fox launched, and from season 25, Fox broadcasts new episodes of The Simpsons in Hungary on Fridays. Currently the episodes are available in Hungarian after two weeks from its original broadcast in the US. =India= The Simpsons (‡§¶ ‡§∏‡§ø‡§Æ‡•ç‡§™‡§∏‡§®‡•ç‡§∏) has aired on Fox India and FX India, in English and dubbed into the Hindi language. Chetan Shashital provides the voice for Homer Simpson in the Hindi dub of the TV series, while during talks of a Hindi dub of The Simpsons Movie, the producers of the planned Hindi dub wanted to choose Boman Irani to voice Homer instead, but that project never came through. =Pakistan= The Simpsons was dubbed for the first time in Punjabi and aired on Geo TV in Pakistan. The name of the localised Punjabi version is Tedi Sim Sim (). All references to drugs, drinking and sex have been removed. It is one of the most popular shows that airs on Geo TV. The original English version also airs but on STAR World. Both of the versions are quite popular. =South Korea= The show arrived to South Korea on January 9, 1995 on MBC and the second season on July 1, 1995. Homer was dubbed by Han Song-Pae. Due to disparate cultural differences, MBC pulled the show from their schedule. In 2002, EBS and Tooniverse acquired the show with individual dubs for each channel. =Japan= In Japan, The Simpsons has been dubbed into Japanese and was first broadcast by WOWOW from September 19, 1992 until 2002 (seasons 1 - 12), and later on the Fox Channel (seasons 13 - 14) until 2007. The show is broadcast on Fox Sports and Entertainment in English with Japanese subtitles from 2008 (season 15 -) onwards. References External links *D'oh!

The company is a fully owned subsidiary of SITA, originally incorporated as OnAir as a joint venture with Airbus in February 2005. In February 2013, Airbus sold its 33% final stake to SITA. The company is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, and has operations in Seattle and sales offices in London, Singapore and Dubai. Services SITAONAIR offers services which aircraft operators can use together or separately: * Flight Operations or Flight planning is the process of producing a flight plan to describe a proposed aircraft flight. *Internet OnAir is a Wi-Fi network which offers Internet access at broadband speed to passengers. *Mobile OnAir is a cellphone service which offers mobile telephony, SMS and narrowband Internet access (56 kbit/s) and so allows passengers to make and receive calls on their mobile phones, send and receive text messages and emails and use the Internet. Airlines can restrict usage of these services at discretion enabling them to ban voice calls and allow only SMS and Internet access instead. Lufthansa is one airline following this restrictive approach due to passengers' alleged desire for quietness during flights. *Link OnAir is a managed network service that allows airlines to use the IP-based satellite connection used by the aforementioned services for other applications, such as supplying in-flight entertainment systems with news content or Internet access and providing mission-critical information and communication services to air crews. *OnAir Play' combines inflight connectivity with films, TV, live news, music, games, magazines and newspapers. Passengers have access to a full range of content including live news and sport, updated throughout the flight and can buy destination-based goods and services to ease their arrival. All three services share the same satellite connection to the ground. SITAONAIR (then OnAir) was the first company to provide integrated GSM and inflight wifi services, with Oman Air as the launch airline in March 2010. SITAONAIR‚Äôs technology has been certified for use on many types of aircraft ‚Äì both private and commercial jets including Boeing and Airbus ‚Äì for short and long haul. In most cases, it is available for linefit or retrofit. = Inmarsat SwiftBroadband (L band) = A satellite data unit (SDU) manufactured by Thales and branded TopConnect establishes a backhaul link to the ground through Inmarsat's SwiftBroadband geostationary satellite constellation operating in the L band around 1500 MHz which allows the use of electronically steerable antennas mounted atop the aircraft fuselage and encased within a fiberglass, RF-transparent radome that have a low profile compared to systems operating in the Ku band or Ka band which today still require mechanically steerable antennas with a significantly higher profile. Thus drag and fuel costs are reduced allowing economical operation even on smaller aircraft like business or regional jets. Inmarsat's SwiftBroadband system covers much of the planet except for the polar regions above ‚àí82 and below +82 degrees latitude and currently provides symmetric data rates of up to 432 kbit/s per channel dependent on signal quality and overall load on the satellite's spotbeam serving the corresponding geographical area. Currently the Thales SDU can bond two channels resulting in a maximum bandwidth of 864 kbit/s. = Inmarsat GlobalXpress (Ka band) = SITAONAIR was appointed as distribution partner for Inmarsat's Global Xpress service in November 2011.

It is used to define the theory of flat cohomology; it also plays a fundamental role in the theory of descent (faithfully flat descent).Springer EoM article The term flat here comes from flat modules. There are several slightly different flat topologies, the most common of which are the fppf topology and the fpqc topology. fppf stands for ', and in this topology, a morphism of affine schemes is a covering morphism if it is faithfully flat and of finite presentation. fpqc stands for ', and in this topology, a morphism of affine schemes is a covering morphism if it is faithfully flat. In both categories, a covering family is defined be a family which is a cover on Zariski open subsets.SGA III1, IV 6.3. In the fpqc topology, any faithfully flat and quasi-compact morphism is a cover.SGA III1, IV 6.3, Proposition 6.3.1(v). These topologies are closely related to descent. The \\"pure\\" faithfully flat topology without any further finiteness conditions such as quasi compactness or finite presentation is not used much as is not subcanonical; in other words, representable functors need not be sheaves. Unfortunately the terminology for flat topologies is not standardized. Some authors use the term \\"topology\\" for a pretopology, and there are several slightly different pretopologies sometimes called the fppf or fpqc (pre)topology, which sometimes give the same topology. Flat cohomology was introduced by Grothendieck in about 1960.*  The big and small fppf sites  Let X be an affine scheme. We define an fppf cover of X to be a finite and jointly surjective family of morphisms :(œÜa : Xa -> X) with each Xa affine and each œÜa flat, finitely presented. This generates a pretopology: for X arbitrary, we define an fppf cover of X to be a family :(œÜ'a : Xa -> X) which is an fppf cover after base changing to an open affine subscheme of X. This pretopology generates a topology called the fppf topology. (This is not the same as the topology we would get if we started with arbitrary X and Xa and took covering families to be jointly surjective families of flat, finitely presented morphisms.) We write Fppf for the category of schemes with the fppf topology. The small fppf site of X is the category O(Xfppf) whose objects are schemes U with a fixed morphism U ‚Üí X which is part of some covering family. (This does not imply that the morphism is flat, finitely presented.) The morphisms are morphisms of schemes compatible with the fixed maps to X. The large fppf site of X is the category Fppf/X, that is, the category of schemes with a fixed map to X, considered with the fppf topology. \\"Fppf\\" is an abbreviation for \\"fid√®lement plate de pr√©sentation finie\\", that is, \\"faithfully flat and of finite presentation\\". Every surjective family of flat and finitely presented morphisms is a covering family for this topology, hence the name. The definition of the fppf pretopology can also be given with an extra quasi-finiteness condition; it follows from Corollary 17.16.2 in EGA IV4 that this gives the same topology.  The big and small fpqc sites  Let X be an affine scheme. We define an fpqc cover of X to be a finite and jointly surjective family of morphisms {uŒ± : XŒ± ‚Üí X} with each XŒ± affine and each uŒ± flat. This generates a pretopology: For X arbitrary, we define an fpqc cover of X to be a family {uŒ± : XŒ± ‚Üí X} which is an fpqc cover after base changing to an open affine subscheme of X. This pretopology generates a topology called the fpqc topology. (This is not the same as the topology we would get if we started with arbitrary X and XŒ± and took covering families to be jointly surjective families of flat morphisms.) We write Fpqc for the category of schemes with the fpqc topology. The small fpqc site of X is the category O(Xfpqc) whose objects are schemes U with a fixed morphism U ‚Üí X which is part of some covering family. The morphisms are morphisms of schemes compatible with the fixed maps to X. The large fpqc site of X is the category Fpqc/X, that is, the category of schemes with a fixed map to X, considered with the fpqc topology. \\"Fpqc\\" is an abbreviation for \\"fid√®lement plate quasi- compacte\\", that is, \\"faithfully flat and quasi-compact\\". Every surjective family of flat and quasi-compact morphisms is a covering family for this topology, hence the name. Flat cohomology The procedure for defining the cohomology groups is the standard one: cohomology is defined as the sequence of derived functors of the functor taking the sections of a sheaf of abelian groups. While such groups have a number of applications, they are not in general easy to compute, except in cases where they reduce to other theories, such as the √©tale cohomology. Example The following example shows why the \\"faithfully flat topology\\" without any finiteness conditions does not behave well. Suppose X is the affine line over an algebraically closed field k. For each closed point x of X we can consider the local ring Rx at this point, which is a discrete valuation ring whose spectrum has one closed point and one open (generic) point. We glue these spectra together by identifying their open points to get a scheme Y. There is a natural map from Y to X. The affine line X is covered by the sets Spec(Rx) which are open in the faithfully flat topology, and each of these sets has a natural map to Y, and these maps are the same on intersections. However they cannot be combined to give a map from X to Y, because the underlying spaces of X and Y have different topologies.

The first section was opened in 1860 and was owned by the Liskeard and Looe Union Canal Company, whose canal had earlier (from 1827) been built to convey sea sand and lime up the valley of the East Looe River, for the purpose of improving agricultural land. When copper and tin ores were discovered on Caradon Hill, they were brought down to Looe Harbour over the canal; the volume of traffic became too much for the canal, and the railway was built. It was short of money and operated with a single hired locomotive at first, carrying minerals from Caradon to the sea at Looe, as well as coal and machinery, and some agricultural materials up the valley. Passenger traffic was started in 1879, and at the same time mineral extraction was already declining. Seeing the disadvantage of being isolated from other railways, the Company built a connecting line between Moorswater and Liskeard station, on the main line; this was opened in 1901, and encouraged passenger and general goods traffic. A peculiarity of the line is the circuitous route from Liskeard to Coombe, and the reversal there; there is a steep gradient to descend from Liskeard into the valley, and sharp curves. The line remains open. Passenger trains are operated by Great Western Railway under the brand name \\"The Looe Valley Line\\". General description The Liskeard to Looe line at Terras level crossing from the causeway, looking eastThe Liskeard and Looe Railway can nowadays be more conveniently thought of as the Looe Branch. It leaves Liskeard station (on the broadly east-west Plymouth to Penzance main line) in a northward direction, turning in a narrow sweep to pass southwards under the main line, continuing to turn to reach Coombe Junction, again facing north. The original line from Looe continued northwards for a short distance at this point to Moorswater, connecting there with the Liskeard and Caradon Railway; nowadays this is reduced to a stub leading to a nearby private siding at Moorswater. Passenger trains to Looe reverse at Coombe, and from there the line runs southwards, descending along the valley of the East Looe River, with intermediate stations at St Keyne Wishing Well Halt, Causeland, and Sandplace, finally reaching Looe. The entire route is single line, but the junction at Coombe and the extension to Moorswater there mean that the section is divided for operational purposes. Origins The agricultural land around Liskeard is of good quality, but tends to considerable acidity, and in the eighteenth and nineteenth century the best land was \\"improved\\" by spreading sea sand or lime on it, to neutralise the acidity. Large quantities of these commodities were required annually, and they were brought in from the coast by pack horse. In 1827 a canal -‚Äì the Liskeard and Looe Union Canal‚Äîwas constructed, between Sandplace on the East Looe River and Moorswater, in the valley west of Liskeard. The canal was moderately successful. From 1836, copper and tin ores were discovered in the Caradon area, and had to be brought to the sea for onward transport to market. Packhorse conveyance to Moorswater meant that the Canal could be used for part of the journey, but the difficulties of horse transport between the mines and Moorswater soon led to plans for the construction of a railway. The Liskeard and Caradon Railway was built to bring the ores, and also granite, down to Moorswater. At Moorswater the minerals were transferred to barges, which transported them down the canal to Looe, from where coastal shipping took them to market. This brought considerable prosperity to the canal, and traffic volume rose, soon reaching the point where the canal was operating at full capacity. Consideration was then given to building a railway along the valley. A meeting held on 30 September 1857 confirmed this proposal, and a Special General Meeting of the Canal Company shareholders met on 13 October 1857; they agreed that they should build a railway. Parliamentary authority to do so was given, in the Liskeard and Looe Railway Act, on 11 May 1858. The Act did not establish a company of that name: the powers to build the railway were conferred on the existing Canal Company. ¬£13,000 of additional share capital was sanctioned, with ¬£4,000 of borrowing powers. Locomotive haulage was authorised, but locomotives were not to pass the end of Looe Bridge to reach Buller Quay on the level. Construction The Liskeard and Looe Railway in 1862 Contracts were let for the construction of the line, and land acquisition was put in hand. The railway was to be built alongside the canal; it is not clear whether the canal was intended to remain in use as well as the railway, or whether this was simply to avoid closing the canal during the railway construction period. Granite sleeper blocks (from Cheesewring) were used. In the Looe Valley from Tregarland to Looe longitudinal timbers were used instead. Granite blocks were obsolete technology at this period, although they had been used on the Liskeard & Caradon line, and longitudinal timbers were in use on the Cornwall Railway. Messenger suggests that the use of these forms of track construction was due to inexperience on the part of the engineers. Construction costs considerably exceeded the authorised capital, and in July 1860 the Managing Committee instructed that the accommodation works (farm crossings etc.) should be postponed; arrangements were made with the L&CR; to use their wagons and a small locomotive was hired in from James Murphy of Newport, Monmouthshire, for ¬£3 per day including crew. Amid much ceremony and jubilation the railway opened, for goods and mineral traffic only, on 27 December 1860. The canal was retained in operation from Sandplace to Looe, as there was an important quay at Sandplace, but it is likely that the higher part of the canal became disused immediately. Early operation Initial operation from 1860 consisted of the use of the hired locomotive Liskeard taking the wagons of the Liskeard and Caradon Railway (L&CR;) down to Looe. Liskeard was brought to the Liskeard station of the Cornwall Railway (no doubt on a wagon), and then hauled to Moorswater by a team of 28 horses. In fact Liskeard served well, for it was purchased from Murphy for ¬£600 in September 1861. The L&CR;, planned as a gravity railway with horse traction for the uphill direction, saw the value of a locomotive, and acquired their own, Caradon in August (probably) of 1862. It was realised that it made little sense to keep the two lines separate, and a Joint Committee had been formed in March 1862‚Äîthe L&CR; had three members to the LLUC's two. Through tolls from Caradon to Looe were published, and operational management of the two railways passed to the L&CR; from 31 March 1862. The L&CR; acquired the locomotive Liskeard, paying the LLUC the ¬£600 it had paid for it. Mineral traffic increased considerably, and the quayside at Looe became seriously congested. However, copper ore traffic peaked at 27,000 tons in 1863, declining afterwards. Inwards coal continued to climb, however, as the mines were exploiting deeper lodes, requiring more engine power for winding and to drain them. Granite held steady at 7,000 tons for several years, and limestone (inwards) held at about 4,000 tons. At this time the L&CR; was concerning itself with extending its line to new mines, as the focus of extraction shifted away from the earlier shaft locations. From time to time the L&CR; also pursued the idea of reaching Launceston by constructing a long branch across the moors. The LLUC by contrast had little to do, their railway being managed by the L&CR.; However shortage of money was a continuing concern, and as some of the Caradon mines also faced financial difficulties, there was considerable pressure for a reduction in tolls. Formal lease to the L&CR;, and passengers carried Sandplace station on the Liskeard to Looe line, looking northThe L&CR; continued to have ambitious plans, and it planned parliamentary authority in 1882 to lease the LLUC's railway, as well as the construction of a line to Liskeard. The proposal fell through, possibly due to the reality of lack of cash, but a formal lease of the LLUC undertaking was made, effective from 27 February 1878. This evidently included control of the residual canal activity. This was ratified by a later Act of 28 July 1884. John Francis Buller had secured a promise when the LLUC's railway was constructed, that he could have a siding at Sandplace, where he had extensive interests. He now agitated for this promise to be fulfilled, and early in 1879 it was provided. The carriage of passengers had been discussed from time to time, and individuals had been carried by express permission, for some time. Against a background of steadily declining mineral business, passenger traffic was started on 11 September 1879. Col Rich of the Board of Trade had made an initial inspection in April 1879 and found that many improvements would be necessary to permit passenger operation, including proper station accommodation, and improvements and widening to several bridges. The works were quickly completed and on 7 September 1879 authorised passenger operation as a light railway; the line was to be worked under \\"One engine in steam\\" arrangements. The L&CR; had funded the works for passenger operation, and took the receipts; in contrast the LLUC seemed somnolent, and it was the L&CR; which obtained an Act of Parliament to connect Moorswater to the Cornish main line of the Cornwall Railway at Liskeard. The Act included several other more or less ambitious extensions, but the L&CR;'s finances were weak, and the Liskeard link was in fact never attempted by them. Further decline of mineral traffic The early promise of mineral extraction from Caradon had now peaked, and difficult mining conditions, and the availability of cheaper minerals from overseas, led to serious decline in the industry. The L&CR; had been in financial difficulty as a result, and in 1886 it defaulted on the lease payment of ¬£1,350 to the LLUC. As a result, the LLUC was unable to make interest payments on its debentures, and dividends were impossible. The L&CR; instituted desperate economy measures and struggled on; In 1890 the Board of Trade took issue with the L&CR; over operating methods on its own line, but also the use of mixed (passenger and goods) trains on the Looe line, with the passenger vehicles at the rear to facilitate shunting at the intermediate sidings. The Companies agreed to limit mixed train operation to one per day, but the placing of the passenger vehicles seems not to have been addressed. Extension to Liskeard The Liskeard and Looe Railway in 1901 For many years, in fact from 1846, there had been proposals to link Moorswater with the Cornwall Railway at the high level in Liskeard,This was during the proposals for the Cornwall Railway itself including a 1 in 7 rack railway. As passengers and non-mineral goods traffic became dominant, the disadvantages of the disconnected route and the inconveniently located Moorswater station motivated the company to act on making a connection to the main line at Liskeard. This became the Liskeard and Looe Extension Railway, which obtained the Royal Assent on 6 July 1895. The name of the company operating the Looe railway line had remained The Liskeard and Looe Union Canal Company and by the same Act it was finally changed to The Liskeard and Looe Railway. The line required ¬£30,000 of share capital and progress stalled due to a lack of willing investors. The Great Western Railway were approached, but were discouraging, and an impasse had been reached, until Captain J E P Spicer, of Spye Park, personally invested the bulk of the capital. Construction started on 28 June 1898. The Looe branch station at Liskeard in Cornwall, looking south; the line to Looe runs to the bottom right of the shotThe vertical interval‚Äî205 feet‚Äîand the topography in general made the connection awkward, and a tortuous route was built, running in nearly a full circle. The Lodge Hill cutting through rock was one of the deepest in the county. The ruling gradient was 1 in 40 and the sharpest curve 8 chains (160m). Because of the steep gradient, locomotives worked chimney first to Liskeard, to ensure that the firebox crown remained covered with water. The line terminated in a south facing bay platform at Liskeard. The connection between the branch line there and the main line was a sharply curved siding. The new line opened on 9 May 1901. A new station at Coombe, near the point of junction with the Looe line, was opened on 15 May 1901 and the line north of that station to Moorswater was closed to passenger traffic on that day. The new connection had a most encouraging immediate effect on business, both passenger and goods, and by the end of the decade receipts had trebled compared with the year prior to opening of the connection. Taken over by the Great Western Railway Coombe Junction on the Liskeard to Looe railway line; Looe is to the right, and the line to Liskeard climbs to the leftThe Great Western Railway (GWR) worked the line (and the Liskeard and Caradon Railway) from 1909, authorised by Act of Parliament of 25 May 1909, and the GWR absorbed the line at the Grouping of the Railways in 1923, under the Railways Act 1921. At the end of independent existence the Liskeard and Looe company was quoted as having issued share capital of ¬£90,000 and a net income (for the fiscal year 1921) of ¬£1,213. In the twentieth century, the line had made the transition from mineral railway to conventional branch line with passenger and agricultural and fisheries goods traffic dominant. There were typically nine or ten return passenger trains on the line, with a Sunday service in addition. There were signalboxes at Liskeard (branch), Coombe Junction, and Looe. That at Looe was a very small structure at the Quay end of the platform, controlling onward movement to the sidings there. However the awkward connection at Liskeard and the reversal at Coombe made operation inconvenient. Moreover, through trains, or even through carriages, would have been very difficult to arrange, and they were never operated, due to the sharp connecting curve at Liskeard and the restricted loading gauge on the branch. Steam passenger train operation required running round at Coombe, and from the 1930s branch trains passed each other there. This seems remarkable as there was only one short platform at Coombe, but at least until the end of steam operation this took place, typically with a Liskeard to Looe train calling at Coombe at 10:02 to 10:07 and a Looe to Liskeard train calling there at 10:06 to 10:09. How this was achieved is explained below. Becket states that in clear weather authority was given for trains climbing up the steep and sharply curved 1 in 40 section from Coombe to Liskeard to be assisted in rear, and that this was usually done by the train engine that had brought the train from Looe to Coombe. The line was classified as \\"uncoloured\\" for engine restriction purposes, but special authority was given for 45XX 2-6-2T locomotives (classified \\"yellow\\"), 90XX 4-4-0s (classified \\"blue\\") and 0-6-0PTs 9700 to 9710 (also \\"blue\\"). In practice the line was in the hands of the 45XXs. Two were based at the sub-shed at Moorswater. A proposed new branch from St Germans to Looe As the branch increased in popularity, especially with summer holidaymakers, the Great Western Railway considered constructing a new seven-mile branch from Trerulefoot, near St Germans, to Looe, in the 1930s. This was coupled with an awareness of the development of daily occupational travel to Plymouth: a 35-minute journey was planned, enabling \\"commuting\\" in modern parlance. A map of the proposed route is shown at Saltash and Tamar Valley History This new line became a firm proposal in 1936, authorised under the Great Western Railway (Additional Powers) Act in that year. The line would have traversed difficult topography, and it would have included three tunnels, including a Seaton Tunnel at 2,288 yards (2,092 m), and a Looe Tunnel at 700 yards (640 m); there was to be a new high level station on the east side of Looe town. The line was to be operated by the new streamlined diesel railcars, giving a 35-minute journey for the 16 miles to Plymouth. A new luxury hotel and golf course were to be built at Looe. Some preparatory work was carried out on the first between Looe and Keveral in 1937, but the Second World War frustrated actual construction, and it was never carried out. The junction would have been at Trerule, on the Cornish main line. The signal box there was enlarged in preparation, although only six levers were in use. Stations The original route was from Looe Quay to Moorswater; the former is sometimes quoted as Looe Bridge, the southern extremity of the running line, but it ran on as sidings to the quayside south of the bridge, on Buller Quay. The line was opened to passenger services on 11 September 1879, and ran two trains each way daily to connect with the Cornwall line; there was an additional train on Saturday evenings. Passenger stations were at: * Looe * Sandplace, opened in September or October (or December) 1881 * Causeland * St Keyne, opened 1 September 1902 (or October 1902) renamed St Keyne Wishing Well Halt in early 2008 * Coombe Junction, opened 1898; renamed Coombe from 1969 * Moorswater. Sandplace, Causeland, St Keyne and Coombe Junction were designated \\"halts\\", from 21 September 1963 in the case of Sandplace, and from 1953 for the others, until the term became disused in the 1970s (5 May 1969 for Sandplace). It was revived for the newly renamed St Keyne Wishing Well Halt and for Coombe from early 2008. Looe passenger station was built in the area known as Shutta, some distance above Looe Bridge. It consisted originally of a single platform 75 feet (23 m) long, with basic facilities. The platform was extended to 200 feet (61 m) when the link at Liskeard was opened in 1901, and it was extended again by 96 feet (29 m) in 1928. Arriving passenger trains moved to run-round facilities south of the station for the purpose, where there was also a carriage shed, and then re-entered the platform. From 11 September 1961, passenger trains were operated by diesel multiple units and goods traffic had ceased (in November 1963), so that the running line ended in buffer stops at the platform end. This was shortened back at the south end in 1966 and again in April 1968. The line southwards to the Quay crossed Polperro Road (i.e. the road on Looe Bridge) on the level; it extended as far as the site of the present Buller Street. It was named Buller Quay after J F Buller, a prominent local landowner who \\"arranged the funding for the quay construction from various sources\\". The harbour lines were closed in 1954. China Clay was exported from the quay between 1904 and the 1920s, declining because of the restriction on vessel size due to rocks at the mouth of the Looe; Fowey took over the traffic. The Quay closed to rail traffic on 23 March 1954. Sandplace was proposed for closure in 1907, but the proposal was not implemented. Goods were handled there in a loop siding on the east side of the line until 15 June 1951. Causeland was the only intermediate station on the line when it originally opened for passengers; it is remote from any local settlement, and in 1881 and again in 1902, when adjacent stations as Sandplace and St Keyne respectively were opened, the Company proposed to close it, but local opposition succeeded on stopping the proposal. Mitchell and Smith show a photograph with stacked wood \\"prepared for the furniture industry\\" stacked on the platform, waiting to be loaded to a train for onward carriage. St Keyne originally had the inscription \\"for St Keyne Well\\" on its station sign. Coombe Junction became an unadvertised passenger stop as early as 1884, presumably without the word \\"junction\\", before the construction of the link line to Liskeard Cornwall Railway station. The walk from Moorswater to Liskeard was steep and lengthy, and a basic stopping place at Coombe gave a somewhat easier walk to the main line station. It was not advertised at first, but in 1896 it was published that trains would stop there on request to the guard. The subsequent Coombe Junction station was provided when the link line was opened on 15 May 1901, close to the site of the earlier stopping point. A loop line of 650 feet (198 m) was provided, and passenger services northward to Moorswater ceased. The platform was 90 feet (27 m) long, on a dead-end road with the running line to Moorswater alongside; there was a crossover at the north end and until 1938 there was a middle crossover. From abolition of the signal box on 8 May 1981, the level crossing there was converted to user operation, and two ground frames were provided at Coombe; No 1 ground frame controlling the junction points, and No 2 ground frame at the north end of passenger operation, controlling trap points from Moorswater. In recent years, most trains on the branch have not made passenger calls at Coombe, and they make the reversal at the point of junction some distance south of the actual Halt. Moorswater was originally the northern terminal of the Canal, and the southern terminal of the Liskeard and Caradon Railway, and became the connecting point between the two railways when the Liskeard and Looe Railway was built. It is now on a short freight-only stub north of Coombe, and serves a private siding used by Imerys Minerals Limited. As the original terminal of the line, it had a carriage shed, a workshop, and an engine shed; the engine shed remained in use until 10 September 1961. The passenger station had a platform 84 feet (26 m) long. It closed to passengers when the link line opened, on 15 May 1901, and ordinary goods facilities ceased in May 1951. The reservoir provided for the canal was in the fork between the Caradon line and the clay dries siding; it was still present (as \\"Old Reservoir\\") when the 1901 Ordnance Survey map was produced. In the twentieth century there was a clay drying shed at Moorswater. The clay arrived as a slurry, piped from Parsons Park, four miles (6.4 km) north. The Network Rail Sectional Appendix quotes \\"Clay Dries\\" at this location. China clay was loaded there for onward rail transit until April 1997; after that date the Moorswater stub became disused until June 1999, from which date cement trains arrive there. In early 2013 there are suggestions that this traffic has ceased permanently. Train services An 1881 public timetable shows two return journeys daily, with an additional train on Wednesdays and Saturdays; the journey time was 30 minutes; the fare was 6¬Ωd third class, 9d second class and 1/6 first class. In 1893 there were two return journeys daily, with two additional trains on Wednesdays. Traction and rolling stock Train at Looe about 1905, from an old postcardAs already mentioned the locomotive Liskeard, an 0-4-0ST, operated on the line from the first. From 1862 the Liskeard and Caradon Railway worked the line, taking over Liskeard for the purpose. It ceased operation on the line in August 1866. An 0-6-0ST called Caradon was purchased from Gilkes, Wilson & Co in 1862, working until 1907. An 0-6-0T called Lady Margaret also worked on the line. An 0-6-0ST called Looe was obtained in May 1901, funded by a director; however its steaming capabilities proved inadequate for the steep climb at Liskeard, and it was sold on to the London & India Docks in April 1902; it worked there until 1950. To replace Looe, another 0-6-0ST, No. 13, was hired from the GWR. After 1909 the line was worked by the GWR, and their own 0-6-0STs and 0-6-0PTs were in use. From the late 1920s, the 44XX 2-6-2T locomotives took over, supplemented by the larger wheeled 45XX class. Coaching stock, required from the start of passenger operation in 1879, consisted of three four-wheeled coaches from the Metropolitan Carriage and Wagon Co. A further four-wheeler was acquired in 1880; continuous vacuum brakes were added in 1890. With the opening of the connection to Liskeard GWR, three new passenger coaches were acquired from Hurst Nelson of Motherwell. They consisted of a composite first and second, and two third class vehicles. They were eight-wheel bogie coaches, and the seating was on the open plan (not compartments) with an American-style verandah at each end of the coach; they were said to be similar to coaches used on the New York Overhead Railway. The three coaches were almost completely destroyed in an accident on 15 April 1906. At this time the Mersey Railway was disposing of locomotive hauled stock, and some of this was bought in as replacements; down to 1907, thirteen four wheelers were obtained second-hand from the Mersey Railway. Mitchell and Smith show a photograph from the late 1920s with smart clerestory eight- wheelers, which \\"probably had been retired from main line use\\". Mile post mileages Cooke gives the zero point for mile post mileage on the branch was on the quay at Looe. He shows a siding running a short distance further south, to \\"Buller Quay\\". The passenger station was at 0m 16c, with Sandplace at 2m 28c, Causeland at 3m 58c, and St Keyne at 5m 03c. The geographical junction at Coombe is at 6m 52c, and Coombe Junction halt is at 6m 62c. Cooke gives 7m 29c as the northern extent of the extant line at Moorswater, but this refers to the line as remaining open in 1947, and not necessarily to any boundary with the Liskeard and Caradon Company's track. Cooke shows the geographical junction at 6m 74c \\"for Liskeard\\", with Liskeard branch line platform at 8m 51c. The dual mileage at Coombe Junction may have been at attempt to give a cumulative mileage for Looe to Liskeard trains. Operation at Coombe The Coombe Junction layout in the 1950sFrom the 1930s until the end of steam operation, the passenger train timetable involved two trains crossing at Coombe Junction, at a time a little after 10.00 a.m. The layout at Coombe in the 1950s had only the terminal platform line and the through Goods Line (with no platform) towards Moorswater. When steam operation was replaced by diesel multiple units, this obviously became much simpler. At the present time, working from Coombe Junction to Looe is by train staff under \\"one train only\\" regulations. The electric train token between Liskeard and Coombe Junction has a key attached to operate the ground frame at Coombe Junction, so that the junction points there can be operated by the train crew.

It was written in December 1940, first published in the January 1942 issue of Startling Stories, and reprinted in the 1972 collection The Early Asimov and the anthology Christmas on Ganymede and Other Stories, edited by Martin H. Greenberg. It was the twenty-sixth story written by Asimov, and the nineteenth to be published. In his autobiography In Memory Yet Green, Asimov had this to say about Christmas on Ganymede: \\"I was trying to be funny, of course. I had this terrible urge to be funny, you see, and had already indulged in humor in more than one story. Writing humor, however, is harder than digging ditches. Something can be moderately well written, or moderately suspenseful, or moderately ingenious, and get by in every case. Nothing, however, can be moderately humorous. Something is either funny, or it is not funny at all. There is nothing in between.\\" \\"Christmas on Ganymede\\" was later included in an early Foundation Series timeline that was published in Thrilling Wonder Stories along with the story \\"The Portable Star\\". Setting As the title indicates, the story is set on the Jovian moon Ganymede, the first story by Asimov set on that world. In the story, Ganymede has an oxygen atmosphere (which is not quite breathable by humans), and its own native flora and fauna, including a moderately intelligent native race, called Ossies for their resemblance to ostriches. There is a human settlement on Ganymede which is run by the Ganymedan Products Corporation, which exports wolframite, karen leaves, and oxite to Earth, and which employs the Ossies as a labor force. Plot summary The humans on Ganymede face a crisis caused by Olaf Johnson, who was inspired by the impending Christmas season to tell the Ossies about Santa Claus. Now the Ossies want a visit from Santa, and they refuse to work until they get one. This will cause Ganymedan Products to fall short of its quota, costing the company its franchise on Ganymede, and costing its employees their jobs. Scott Pelham, the Commander of the base, orders his men to stage a visit by Santa, with Johnson in the starring role. A flying sleigh is built out of gravo-repulsors and compressed air jets, and eight local animals called spinybacks, after being dosed with brandy to keep them docile, are harnessed to it to serve as reindeer. Johnson, dressed vaguely like Santa, manages to fly the contraption to a crude lodge where the Ossies are waiting for him. He leaves Christmas tree ornaments in their stockings, which the Ossies take to be Santa Claus eggs. All seems well, until the Ossies demand a visit from Santa every year, and one of the men realizes they mean once every Ganymedan revolution, which is just over seven Earth days. Notes Asimov wrote \\"Christmas on Ganymede\\" in December 1940; John W. Campbell rejected it and Frederik Pohl's purchase was canceled. Asimov realized that a Christmas story needed to be sold by July to appear by Christmas, and in June 1941 sold it to Startling Stories.

The monument includes a slight univallate hillfort situated on a prominent hill overlooking the valleys of two separate tributaries to the River Lowman. The monument survives as a sub- circular enclosure, defining an area which slopes gently down to the south and measures approximately 150m in diameter. It is clearly demarcated on all sides by a rampart which varies in height from 1m up to 2.4m internally, being generally of greater height on the northern side of the enclosure. Externally this rampart is up to 2.9m high. Surrounding the rampart is an outer ditch which measures up to 5.4m wide and 0.4m deep and this is visible on all sides of the monument, although it is predominantly preserved as a buried feature. On the north eastern side, the outer edge of this ditch is defined by a field boundary bank and the infilled ditch has been used in the past as a track. There is an inturned entrance on the north eastern side which measures 7m wide, and the inturned banks are up to 2.2m wide and 0.4m high. The enclosure is crossed by a parish boundary bank which measures up to 2m wide and 1.5m high, and has been partially cut at the north eastern corner by a quarry, approximately 20m long, 15m wide and up to 2.8m deep, which lies to the north of the entrance. A further quarry lies to the south of the parish boundary bank, on the western side of the enclosure and measures long, wide and up to deep. A third quarry lies to the north west and has partially cut into the ditch and rampart on this side; however much of this quarry lies just beyond the monument itself. A further entrance to the enclosure may lie on the western side, where the rampart is seen to kink slightly inwards. The stock proof fences around the rampart and ditch, the gates and gateposts which facilitate access, the Ordnance Survey triangulation point which is situated on the north eastern side of the enclosure just above the quarry, and the field boundary bank which defines the outer edge of the ditch in the north eastern corner are excluded from the scheduling, although the ground beneath all these features is included.

The screenplay by Julien Josephson and Walter Ferris was loosely based on the 1881 children's story of the same name by Swiss author Johanna Spyri. The film is about an orphan named Heidi (Temple) who is taken from her grandfather (Jean Hersholt) to live as a companion to Klara, a spoiled, crippled girl (Marcia Mae Jones). The film was a success and Temple enjoyed her third year in a row as number one box office draw. Plot Adelheid, called Heidi (Shirley Temple), is an eight-year-old Swiss orphan who is given by her aunt Dete (Mady Christians) to her mountain-dwelling hermit grandfather, Adolph (Jean Hersholt). While Adolph behaves coolly toward her at first, her cheery nature turns him warm, and sees him open up to the nearby town. Heidi is then stolen back by her aunt, to live in the wealthy Sesemann household in Frankfurt am Main as a companion to Klara (Marcia Mae Jones), a sheltered, disabled girl in a wheelchair who is constantly watched by the strict Fr√§ulein Rottenmeier (Mary Nash). Heidi is unhappy but makes the best of the situation, always longing for her grandfather. When Klara's body and spirits mend under Heidi's cheerful companionship, Rottenmeier (who has tried to keep Klara dependent upon her) tries to get rid of Heidi by selling her to the gypsies, but she is stopped by the police. Heidi is rescued and reunited with her grandfather. Cast * Shirley Temple as Heidi, a young orphan living with her hermitted grandfather in an Alpine hut. She is very happy, optimistic and adventurous and she loves her grandfather very much. * Jean Hersholt as Adolph Kramer, Heidi's grandfather who is grumpy at first but learns to love Heidi as his granddaughter. * Marcia Mae Jones as Klara Sesemann, a kind and crippled rich girl but very caring, polite and happy towards Heidi. * Sidney Blackmer as Herr Sesemann, Klara's doting and busy father who wants nothing but happiness for his daughter. * Thomas Beck as Pastor Schultz, the pastor of the village who talks to Adolph about Heidi's future. * Arthur Treacher as Andrews, a butler in the Sesemann household who is always nice to Heidi. * Mary Nash as Fr√§ulein Rottenmeier, the ch√¢telaine of the Sesemann household who is mean and strict on Klara's well-being. * Delmar Watson as Peter, the goat general of Adolph Kramer's and a good friend of Heidi's. * Mady Christians as Dete, Heidi's self-interested aunt who has taken care of her for 6 years. * Helen Westley as Blind Anna, Peter's grandmother. * Christian Rub as Baker * Frank Reicher as Police Lieutenant (uncredited) Production The Alpine scenes were filmed at Lake Arrowhead, California with cast and crew staying in the Lake Arrowhead Hotel or in private chalets. Temple lived in a trailer parked on a hillside and only left it at the very last moment to do her scenes - after her stand-in had finished with lights and sound. Temple had at least eight bodyguards who escorted her to and from the trailer and about the area when necessary. Midway through the shooting of the movie, the dream sequence was added into the script. There were reports that Temple was behind the dream sequence and that she was enthusiastically pushing for it but in her autobiography she vehemently denied this. Her contract gave neither her or her parents any creative control over the movies she was in. While she enjoyed the opportunity to wear braids and to be lifted on high wire, she saw this as the collapse of any serious attempt by the studio to build upon the dramatic role from the previous movie Wee Willie Winkie.Shirley Temple Black, \\"Child Star: An Autobiography\\" (New York: McGraw- Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 192-193. During the scene where Temple's character gets butted by the goat, she initially did the scene herself while completely padded up. After a few takes, however, her mother stepped in and insisted that a double be used. One of the extras, a boy, was dressed up to look like her. The boy's father was so upset over him doubling for a girl that he prohibited him from ever acting again. The double, who was not named, would later share diplomatic duties with Temple in Africa. Temple also had trouble milking the goat. To remedy this, Dwan had a flexible piece of tubing installed in such a way as to make it look as if the goat was being milked.Shirley Temple Black, \\"Child Star: An Autobiography\\" (New York: McGraw- Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 190-192. During the making of the movie, director Dwan had new badges made for the Shirley Temple Police Force. This was an informal group thought up by Temple in 1935, which was, as she described \\"an organized system of obligations from whomever I was able to shanghai into membership.\\"Shirley Temple Black, \\"Child Star: An Autobiography\\" (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 89. Every child wore one after swearing allegiance and obedience to 'Chief' Temple. Everyone on the set was soon wearing badges with Temple strutting about giving orders to the crew such as \\"Take that set down and build me a castle.\\" They went along with the game. Temple made one other film in 1937, Wee Willie Winkie. The child actress was growing older and the studio was questioning how much longer she could keep playing \\"cute\\" roles when Heidi was filmed, but she retained her position as number one at the box office for the third year in a row. Reception Contemporary reviews were generally positive. Frank S. Nugent wrote that the film \\"contains all the harmless sweetness and pretty pictures one expects to find on the juvenile shelf,\\" and found the supporting cast \\"quite up to Miss Temple's demanding standard.\\" Variety gave the cast \\"more than a modicum of credit for making the picture what it is\\" and singled out Hersholt as \\"excellent.\\" Harrison's Reports called it \\"a charming picture\\" that was \\"filled with human appeal.\\" \\"Shirley Temple's latest picture is one of her best,\\" reported Film Daily. \\"In every way, the picture is grand entertainment with its sweet sentiment, and its socko hilarity is ever a source of rollicking laughter.\\" The Lewiston Evening Journal wrote that Temple had never been given \\"a more captivating role than that of Heidi,\\" adding, \\"The story is of the old-fashioned type but we accept it uncritically with its improbabilities, its hectic race at the end, its tears, its laughter - it is so very human in its appeal.\\" John Mosher of The New Yorker was less enthusiastic, writing, \\"There seems something rather musty and familiar about most of the predicaments in this movie.\\" The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2006: AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers ‚Äì Nominated See also * Shirley Temple filmography * Heidi References Sources * External links  * Category:1937 films Category:American films Category:American black-and-white films Category:Heidi films Category:Films directed by Allan Dwan Category:Films about orphans Category:Films set in Switzerland Category:Films set in the 1880s Category:20th Century Fox films Category:English-language films Category:Films set in Frankfurt Category:American musical drama films Category:1930s musical drama films Category:Films about paraplegics or quadriplegics Category:1937 drama films ","title":"Heidi (1937 film)"},{"id":"10539304","text":"Put Down Your Whip () is a 1939 oil painting by Chinese Realism painter Xu Beihong. Completed during Xu's stay in Singapore, the painting was exhibited numerous times before its disappearance from public view in 1954. It re- emerged in 2007 and was sold for HK$72 million (US$9.2 million) in an auction on 7 April 2007 in Hong Kong, then setting a record for the highest price ever paid for a Chinese painting at an auction. History =Creation= Xu Beihong and Wang Ying with the painting In October 1939, during his stay in Singapore, Xu Beihong was inspired by a street drama performance titled Put Down Your Whip by actress Wang Ying, a friend of the artist. Written by Chen Liting based on a play by Tian Han, the drama depicts a girl and her father who escaped from the Japanese-occupied Northeast China and performed in the streets for a living. They sang about the hardship under the Japanese occupation and inspired their listeners to support the anti-Japanese war. Deeply moved by the drama, Xu spent ten days painting a life-size portrait of Wang with her audience in the background. He then titled the painting Put Down Your Whip after the drama.\\"Xu Beihong's masterpiece sold at record price for Chinese painting\\", People's Daily, 2007-04-08. Retrieved on 2007-04-08. =After Xu's death= The painting was exhibited on numerous occasions during Xu's life. However, it disappeared from public view in 1954, a year after Xu's death. According to Sotheby's Asia chairman Patti Wong, Xu gave the painting to a close friend named Huang Menggui. After Huang died, his descendants approached the National Museum of Singapore in the hope that the museum could take the painting into its collection, but it did not happen for unspecified reasons. Huang's descendants then approached Singaporean collector Tan Tsze Chor, but Tan died abruptly, before the deal was made. The painting eventually landed in the hands of an anonymous Asian collector, until being put up for auction in 2007. \\"Xu's 1939 painting fetch record price\\" , Lianhe Zaobao, 2007-04-08.

The painting was bought by an anonymous collector over the telephone after competition from at least four other bidders. In response to the auction, some art historians have criticized the explosion in the prices for Asian art, in particular over exuberant buyers for sending prices sky-high.

He joined the University of Birmingham as a lecturer in modern history in 1949. He was made Professor of Modern History in 1963, and served as Chair of the School of History between 1963 and 1968. He the moved to London, where he was Professor of French History at University College London from 1968 to 1990. His books included France and the Dreyfus Affair (1966), France (for the Thames & Hudson 'Nations and Peoples' series, 1969), An Idea of Europe (with Richard Hoggart, 1987) and The Age of Illusion: art and politics in France, 1918-1940 (with his wife Madeleine Johnson, 1987). From 1983 he was General Editor of the Fontana History of Modern France. Unashamedly Francophile, Johnson devoted his academic career to improving relations between France and Britain. He became an advisor to Margaret Thatcher on all matters concerning France, although his own political position was always something of a mystery. Honours A collection of essays in his honour was compiled by Martyn Cornick and Ceri Crossley under the title Problems in French History and published by Palgrave in 2000. Johnson was awarded a number of honours by the French government: National Order of Merit (1980); Commandeur of the Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques (1987); and Chevalier (1990) then Officier (1997) of the Legion of Honour. He did not receive any honours from the British government.

He was Canadian champion in 1972 and 1975, represented Canada with success on four Olympiad teams, and played in two Interzonals. He moved to the United States in 1979, settling in California. He has been retired from competitive play since the mid-1980s, and works as a computer programmer. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, he was a frequent training partner of Bobby Fischer, who stayed at his home in San Francisco for extended periods.  Early years  Biyiasas was born in Athens, Greece, moved to Canada as a young boy, and grew up in Vancouver. He won the first of his four British Columbia chess championships in 1968; he would repeat in 1969, 1971, and 1972. He played in the 1969 Closed Canadian Chess Championship in Pointe Claire, and finished in the middle of the field, as Duncan Suttles won. Biyiasas was of National Master strength by this time. He represented Canada as second reserve on its bronze medal-winning team at the 1971 World Students' Olympiad in Mayag√ºez, Puerto Rico, where he scored 5/7 (+4 ‚àí1 =2). He graduated from the University of British Columbia in 1972 with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. He won the first of his three British Columbia Open titles in 1972, and repeated in 1976 and 1978.  Canadian Champion, International Master  Biyiasas won the Zonal Closed Canadian Championship, Toronto 1972, with 12/17, half a point ahead of Lawrence Day and George Kuprejanov. For this, he earned the International Master title, as did Day and Kuprejanov. It marked an enormous leap in class for him in just one year, from second reserve on the Canadian student team to national champion. Biyiasas tied for 1st‚Äì4th places at Norristown 1973 at 7¬Ω/11, along with Kenneth Rogoff, Bruno Parma, and Herman Pilnik. He struggled in his first super-strong tournament, the 1973 Petropolis Interzonal, with 6¬Ω/17, for 15th place, as Henrique Mecking won. But he stayed on in Brazil for the S√£o Paulo event, and placed respectably with 6¬Ω/13. Biyiasas won the British Columbia Diamond Jubilee Open in 1973, and repeated in 1974 and 1976. He notched a strong third place at the 1974 Pan American Chess Championship in Winnipeg with 11/15, as Walter Browne won. He tied with Kim Commons for the American Open title in 1974. He repeated as Canadian champion in the Zonal at Calgary 1975 with 12/15, half a point ahead of Kevin Spraggett. This earned him another Interzonal chance at Manila 1976, but he again found the company too strong, finishing with 6/19 for 17th place, as Mecking won again.  Medals in Olympiads  Biyiasas made four appearances for Canada in chess Olympiad competition. He won board medals on three occasions, including a silver and two bronzes, scored (+28 ‚àí7 =18) overall, for 70 per cent, and helped Canada to some of its best-ever team finishes in 1976 (8th) and 1978 (11th).OlimpBase Men's Chess Olympiads Peter Biyiasas * 1972 Skopje board 4: 11¬Ω/15 (+8 ‚àí0 =7), bronze medal; * 1974 Nice board 2: 9¬Ω/17 (+7 ‚àí5 =5); * 1976 Haifa board 1: 7¬Ω/10 (+6 ‚àí1 =3); bronze medal; * 1978 Buenos Aires board 2: 9/12 (+7 ‚àí1 =4); silver medal.  Grandmaster  Biyiasas made an excellent tied 3rd‚Äì4th at New York City 1977 with 8¬Ω/14, as Leonid Shamkovich and Andrew Soltis won. In the Canadian Zonal, Toronto 1978, he finished 2nd with 10/15, as Jean Hebert won. He was granted the Grandmaster title in 1978 for his strong New York and Buenos Aires Olympiad performances. Biyiasas scored 7¬Ω/14 at Hastings 1978‚Äì79 to tie for 7th‚Äì10th places, as Ulf Andersson won. He won the 1979 Paul Keres Memorial tournament in Vancouver. He immigrated to the US in 1979, working in San Jose, California as an IBM computer programmer. Biyiasas scored 6¬Ω/15 at Hastings 1979‚Äì80 for 13th place, as Andersson won again. One of his strongest career results came in a very strong field at Wijk aan Zee 1980, where he made 7¬Ω/13 to tie for 4th‚Äì6th places, as Browne and Yasser Seirawan won. He scored an excellent 2nd place at Zrenjanin 1980. He played in the United States Chess Championship at Greenville 1980, finishing just below 50 per cent. Biyiasas won several tournaments in the San Francisco area, while visiting, and after moving there. These included four titles in the Carroll Capps Memorial (1981, 1982, 1983, and 1985); and four titles in the Arthur Stamer Memorial (1978, 1979, 1982, and 1984). These events were organized by the Mechanics Institute Chess Room. During a four-month period in 1981, Biyiasas played 17 five-minute games with Bobby Fischer, who was staying in his apartment at the time. Fischer, although he had been absent from competitive play for nine years, won all 17 games. Biyiasas said that he didn't think Fischer had lost anything in form, despite the layoff. Biyiasas generally favoured unusual openings, staying away from mainline Sicilians after opening with 1.e4. He tended towards King's Indian Attack formations, and aimed to get play into maneuvering channels.http://www.chessdryad.com/articles/mar/biyiasas/mar1.htm Biyiasas has been retired from competitive chess since 1985. He was married to Ruth Haring, a Women's International Master. They have three children, Lauren, Tina, and Theodore. His current FIDE rating is 2450.

Advocacy of emigration to Africa The American Colonization Society was established in 1817 by a variety of national leaders, both from the North and South, to relocate free blacks from the United States to other countries, preferably in Africa. In a pamphlet issued to promote its efforts, Dewey stated that colonization was the \\"only possible means of gradually ridding the United States of a mighty evil, and of obliterating the foulest stain upon our nation's honor\\", referring to the presence of free blacks, reminders of the flourishing institution of slavery.David M. Streiffor, \\"The American Colonization Society: an Application of Republican Ideology to Early Antebellum Reform\\", The Journal of Southern History, 45 (1979), p. 210. Dewey believed that free blacks were a threat to the security and well-being of the United States, as he thought they could not be assimilated in the larger society. His confidence in the ACS plan was demonstrated in a speech in which he predicted that within 40 years, \\"all but the aged free blacks\\" would have immigrated to countries elsewhere in the world. Advocacy of emigration to Haiti =Initial approaches= Some time in the early months of 1824, after failing to recruit enough potential emigrants for the west coast of Africa and lagging behind raising funds, Dewey dared to come up with another relocation plan. Dewey later confessed that Blacks had told him that they would prefer to move to Haiti, and even Whites said that they would be more willing to financially support relocation efforts on the island than on West Africa. So, without even consulting his superiors in the American Colonization Society, he approached the government of President Jean-Pierre Boyer of Haiti, who had hoped to encourage immigrants and establish ties with the US. In his letter, Dewey gave the impression to Boyer that he was indeed the \\"General Agent\\" of the American Colonization Society. Boyer, who knew well the political weight of the organization, was elated by Dewey's interest on Haiti. The President immediately sent judge and diplomat Jonathas Granville to the United States with fifty thousand pounds of coffee to begin the emigration project. In letters to President Boyer, Dewey appeared to promote human rights. He wrote to President Boyer in a manner that depicted concern, stating that any agreement between them would benefit all parties involved. He asked the President to describe what living and working conditions the potential immigrants would have. Dewey wanted to ensure African-American rights, and asked if they would be allowed to practice their own religion. He also suggested the ACS's purchasing land from the Haitian government to establish a colony run by American law. Dewey ended his letter with: > These benevolent men, therefore, are looking for an asylum for these injured > sons of Africa in some other country, and they believe, that should the > island of Hayti, be able to unite with them, very much for the welfare of > the descendants of Africans, and the ultimate benefit of Hayti, might be > effected.Dewey, Loring D: Correspondence Relative to the Emigration to > Hayti, of the Free People of Colour, in the United States, Together with the > Instructions to the Agent Sent Out by President Boyer, pp. 5-6, 1824. =Success= After Granville arrived in Philadelphia in May 1824, he was welcome by Bishop Richard Allen and an entire cadre of abolitionists who helped organize the movement, which resulted in more than 6,000 free-Blacks emigrating to Haiti in a period of two years. In September 1824, three ships, each carrying a few hundred free Blacks, departed from New York, Baltimore and Philadelphia with the first emigrants for Haiti. The American Colonization Society fired Dewey when they learned that he had written to Boyer without their permission. They opposed this project from the beginning because it went against their goal to promote Black colonization in West Africa. Despite the ACS opposition, the emigration was a success since for more than two years hundred of Blacks left for Haiti. Granville's personal correspondence reveals that Dewey wanted to replace him as the Haitian emissary in the United States, but Boyer opposed that idea. Dewey was left to simply support the project, which wane down after Haiti lost interest in the emigrants. in 1825 Boyer had entered in negotiations with France for recognition, and had agreed to pay a huge indemnity to former planters. This treaty left Haiti without much resources to support the emigration from the U.S. And yet, Blacks continue arriving on the island. Later political work In the 1830s Dewey became an active member of the American Peace Society and Temperance Society. His printing press was busy publishing pamphlets promoting social reform.

With its 50,000-watt signal, and broadcast tower at 1,000 feet, WHKO is one of the strongest FM stations in the Southwestern Ohio area, and used to make mention of this during on-air promos. Its studios are co-located with the Dayton Daily News, WHIO-AM-FM-TV and two more radio stations in the Cox Media Center building near downtown Dayton. WHKO has a transmitter in Dayton's westside. K99.1FM employs a New Country format and has historically played more music and fewer commercials than most radio stations in the Dayton/Cincinnati radio market. With a strong signal and a commitment to playing more music than the competition, WHKO has a long history of being near the top of the Dayton Arbitron ratings since it began its country format in March 1989. K99.1FM also shows up regularly in the Cincinnati Nielsen ratings, as its signal comes in clear throughout the greater Cincinnati market as well. Early history WHKO was founded in 1946 as WHIO-FM, with a beautiful music format which since the 1960s was a kindred complement to the middle of the road format of WHIO (AM). While many FM stations initially failed during its inception in the 1950s in favor of AM, WHIO-FM flourished and remained solid. It eventually became and remained the top-rated station in the Dayton market for many years as FM was considered to be an easy alternative to commercial pop music and the rise of Top 40 and country music on the AM dial during that time. The format remained consistent in the 1970s and 1980s playing reel to reel of beautiful music provided by national syndicators. =Final Years= During its later years WHIO-FM ran the Bonneville live assist beautiful music format. with continued success. During WHIO-FM's final year of operation the 25-54 demographic ratings were slipping, so management decided to add more modern hits from the adult contemporary charts in an attempt to help increase ratings. Songs from The Eagles and Jim Croce were added and played three or four times per hour. When this tactic failed, Cox Broadcasting decided to research the market for a format hole. Many easy listening and beautiful music stations evolved into soft adult contemporary stations but with WVUD in Dayton already in the format as Delightful 100FM, Cox opted to instead change the format completely. WHKO Today On March 17, 1989, the station switched its call sign to WHKO, and the format abruptly changed from beautiful music to country. This was unexpected in the market since the 12+ overall numbers still had WHIO-FM as the #1 station in the market. The last song played on WHIO-FM was Rick Astley's \\"Together Forever\\", at which point the format flipped to country music, although the announcer pre-sold another 30 minutes of easy listening favorites. The first song played under the new format was Barbara Mandrell's \\"I Was Country When Country Wasn't Cool\\". The first announcer on the station was Jim Manley who at that time moved from WHIO (AM) to mornings on the new K99.1FM. Nancy Wilson joined Manley shortly thereafter and to this day remains the morning host. The previous format's audience, mainly the older listeners, were very unhappy about the format change. The station received hundreds of complaint letters, and other radio stations in and around the Dayton area fielded numerous phone calls demanding to know why \\"FM 99\\" was playing country music. The change was otherwise well-received in the market; after 2 ratings periods WHKO maintained its number one ranking among its target demographic of 25-54. Prior to the switch, the top-rated country station in Dayton through the 1970s and 1980s was WONE (AM), which now employs a sports/talk format. At first the station was \\"easy listening country\\" playing more soft crossover hits from Kenny Rogers, Lionel Richie, Rita Coolidge, Gordon Lightfoot then most modern country stations at that time. The disk jockey style was very laid back, at times it sounded almost like the previous format. Over the next several years the station slowly modernized the format and today is reminiscent of a CHR country format with tight rotations, upbeat jocks and community involvement. WHKO is the Dayton Children's Radiothon station the market and has raised over $4 million dollars since 1998. WHKO won the National Association of Broadcasters Crystal Award in 2018 for outstanding community service. WHKO was only one of eight stations receiving the award. WHKO has also been nominated for several Academy of Country Music and Country Music Association awards. In November 2006 the WHIO-FM calls were reborn at 95.7 FM in Piqua (the former WDPT) as a simulcast of WHIO-AM's news talk format. Ironically when WHIO-FM abandoned the beautiful music format, WPTW-FM which was the station at 95.7 tried to capture the former audience by flipping to Clear 95 with the call letters WCLR. WHKO-HD2/HD3 WHKO's HD-2 digital subcarrier airs a simulcast of classic hits formatted WZLR 95.3 in Xenia and Dayton translator 101.1 The Eagle. WHKO's 99.1 HD-3 digital subcarrier is leased to BC Dayton Broadcasting as \\"The Soul of Dayton,\\" a possible reference and tribute to the former WDAO-FM (now WMMX) which airs an urban oldies format.

It is both a court of cassation and a constitutional court. The courthouse is in Tartu. History =During the First Republic (1919-1940)= With the First Constitution of Estonia and the Supreme Court Act, the Estonian Constituent Assembly established the Supreme Court of Estonia as a court of cassation on 21 October 1919. The first Justices of the Court were Kaarel Parts (Chief Justice), Paul Beniko, Rein Koemets, Jaan L√µo, Hugo Reiman, Martin Taevere and Peeter Puusepp. The Court first sat in Tartu Town Hall on 14 January 1920. During the centralisation of power in 1935, the Supreme Court was transferred to Tallinn, operating from a specially remodelled building on Wismari Street. When the Court last sat on 31 December 1940, it accepted an order by the government of the Estonian SSR to disband itself as of 1 January 1941. =Soviet era (1941-1991)= The Supreme Court headquarters (1941-1991). The Supreme Court of the Estonian SSR () was a Republican affiliate institution of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union. All court decisions were made in accordance with the Soviet Constitution and the Estonian SSR's Constitution. The court's composition was determined by the republic's Supreme Soviet every five years. It was composed of a Civil Chamber, a Criminal Chamber, the Presidium and Military court. According to an act by the Supreme Soviet on 8 May 1990, the court was legally separated from the national institution. It took effect days later on 16 May. =After restoration of independence (since 1992)= When the Fourth Constitution of Estonia was adopted by referendum, the legal basis was created for the re-establishment of the Supreme Court. Rait Maruste was designated as the first Chief Justice. The re-established Court held its first hearing in Tartu Town Hall on 27 May 1993. Courthouse In 1919, a manor house on Aia street in Tartu was designated for the Supreme Court by the Government of Estonia. Moving to the designated building was delayed, though, because the building in question was used for the peace negotiations between Estonia and Russian SFSR; on 2 February 1920 the building hosted the signing of the Treaty of Tartu. The Supreme Court worked out of the Aia Street building during the period of 1920-1935. The building currently houses a secondary school - Jaan Poska Gymnasium. From 1935 until its disbandment in 1940, the Court sat in Tallinn, in a building on the current Wismari Street.Building of the Supreme Court in Tartu (Lossi 17) In 1993, the Supreme Court moved into its current building - the former barracks-infirmary at Lossi 17. Chambers =Supreme Court en banc= The Court en banc (Estonian: √úldkogu) is the highest body of the Court and consists of all 19 Justices. Any decision is voted upon on a simple majority basis; in case of a tie, the Chief Justice has the deciding vote. For the Court to be capable of making decisions, at least 11 Justices must be present. Only the Court en banc has the authority to propose appointments and dismissals of inferior Judges, decide on disciplinary complaints against Judges and authorize declarations of incapability of members of Riigikogu, the President of Estonia, the Chancellor of Justice or the Auditor General. A case can be referred to the Court en banc by any of the lower chambers of the Court, and all decisions made by the en banc panel are binding for the lower chambers. In 2012, for example, the Court sat en banc to decide on the legality of the European Stability Mechanism. The case was referred to the panel by the Constitutional Review Chamber because of its public and controversial nature.Application by the Chancellor of Justice to declare Article 4, section 4 of the Treaty Establishing the ESM unconstitutional (2012) 3-4-1-6-12 - Judgement; Recording of the Trial = Intercameral (ad hoc) panel = An Intercameral (ad hoc) panel (Estonian: Erikogu) is summoned to solve disputes between chambers of the court regarding interpretation of the law and to decide on intra-court disputes on jurisdiction. An intercameral panel is summoned and presided over by the Chief Justice and includes two Justices from all relevant ordinary (Civil, Criminal and Administrative) chambers. Decisions of the intercameral panel are binding for lower chambers, unless they've been overruled by the Court en banc. =Constitutional Review Chamber= The Constitutional Review Chamber (Estonian: P√µhiseaduslikkuse j√§relevalve kolleegium) fulfils the role of the constitutional court in the Estonian legal system. The Chief Justice of the Court is ex officio the chairman of the Constitutional Review Chamber. The Constitutional Review Chamber is composed of the Chief Justice and eight Justices, representing all ordinary lower chambers. Annually, two of the most senior members of the Chamber are released from their duties thereto, and two new ones are elected by the Court en banc. The Constitutional Review Chamber can strike out in any legislation that is deemed unconstitutional, and can advise Riigikogu on the constitutionality of any proposed EU law. According to Chapter 2 of the Constitutional Review Court Procedure Act, an application for Constitutional Review can be started by the Chancellor of Justice, the President of Estonia, any Local Government Council or an inferior Court.Constitutional Review Procedure Act of Estonia Even though the Law doesn't allow for individuals or companies to lodge applications, in some cases such applications have been accepted, if the applicants had no other practicable way of constitutional protection. =Administrative, Civil and Criminal Chambers= The three ordinary chambers of the Court hear appeals and applications for review of new evidence from Circuit Courts. The Administrative Chamber (Estonian: Halduskolleegium) has six members, the Civil Chamber (Estonian: Tsiviilkolleegium) includes seven Justices, and the Criminal Chamber (Estonian: Kriminaalkolleegium) has six members. Most cases are heard by a panel of three judges; however, if the panel disagrees on the interpretation of a point of law or wishes to overrule a previous decision of their own chamber, the case is transferred to the full Chamber. If it's necessary to overrule a previous decision of another chamber, the case is head by an ad hoc inter-chamberal panel.

Hiking The Trail to Holy Jim Falls More than one trail leads to the top of Santiago Peak, but the most popular among hikers is the Holy Jim trail. The Holy Jim trail gains about in elevation and is a round trip. It is a moderate to strenuous hike and is most enjoyable during spring and winter due to the large number of insects during warmer times of the year. From the summit of Santiago Peak, one can see the larger Southern California peaks like San Gorgonio Mountain, San Jacinto Peak, and Mount San Antonio. However, due to the large number of antennas at the top of Santiago Peak, a full 360-degree view of the surrounding landscapes is not possible. Those at the top must walk approximately a quarter-mile around the perimeter of all the antennas to take in views of every direction.

It is the final book of Cordell's \\"Mortymer Trilogy\\". The novel is Cordell's third book in the lives of the Mortymer family, after Rape of the Fair Country and Hosts of Rebecca. It tells of the Evan family buying a canal barge on the Neath valley canal. There they meet Mari Mortymer and her adopted daughter Rhiannon. It tells of the coal industry in Resolven as well as the Brunel designed Canal system of the valley. It describes the landscape of the area (still viewable today over 150 years later) as well as the hardship suffered by the family, and growth of disease and population topography in the industrial revolution. Cordell's third book in the lives of Mortymer family switches its focus to the canals and waterways of South Wales, especially the Neath Valley. The narrator is Bryn Evan, son of Mostyn and he describes how he, his Father and the Evan family take delivery of a new barge as owner/operators. They struggle to maintain a working existence against the onslaught of the new railways then under construction and being forged by the inspired engineering skills of Isambard Kingdom Brunel which are penetrating the valleys of South Wales. Against this backdrop, Mostyn marries Marie Mortymer who also appears in 'Rape of the Fair Country' and 'The Hosts of Rebecca'. Time passes and the family have to accept the inevitable that the canals are failing, so they move to Aberdare to work in the pits and experience the grinding poverty and the everyday struggle of the Miners working the coalfields of the middle period of the 19th.

House Fontainon The Fontainon dynasty is the ruling family of Ile-Rien, governing for the several centuries that comprise the time-span of the books. =King Fulstan= The deceased husband of Ravenna Fontainon, he was bestowed the rights and privileges of a regnant monarch by his father-in-law, the previous king. He is the father of Roland by his consort Ravenna, and the father of Kade Carrion by Moire, the Queen of Air and Darkness a visiting dignitary to his court. He was notoriously petty and ineffectual, and was particularly cruel to his son, the future King Roland. Fulstan is deceased at the beginning of 'The Element of Fire.' =Queen Ravenna= The daughter of the previous Fontainon king, widow of King Fulstan, and doyenne of House Fontainon, she is the true ruler in Ile- Rien. In her youth, she was an admired beauty with pale skin and reddish auburn hair. As dowager queen, she maintains her son Roland's reign, seeing to its stability. While queen consort, she was a dynamic leader in the war against the hostile Bisrans, often taking command in the field directly. Feared by her courtiers and ambassadors to her court, she is regarded as a brilliant and capable ruler. Her son Roland is a great disappointment to her, as was her lack of additional children. She hand selected her daughter-in-law Queen Falaise in the hopes that she could train her to be a fitting successor, able to temper the reckless excesses of her son. Queen Ravenna's long-time lover, Thomas Boniface is the captain of her squadron of dedicated armsmen, The Queen's Guard. In the later books, she is a celebrated national heroine, and has many monuments dedicated to her. =King Roland= The son of the late Fulstan and Ravenna, the scion of House Fontainon, King Roland is a weak king, prone to rash decision-making, and excessively vulnerable to flattery. His closest companion is Denzil, the Duke of Alsene, an ambitious kinsman who has designs upon the throne. Roland's wife is the foreign-born Falaise. The two are barely acquainted with one another, leading largely separate lives at court. =Queen Falaise= Roland's queen, she is the third daughter of nobles from neighboring Umberwald, and a princess in her own land. Originally a studious, pensive young woman, she was selected to be the future queen by Ravenna, who had hopes of molding her as a prot√©g√©, able to temper the excesses of Roland and provide wise counsel. As a young queen, she assembled a flattering entourage of poets and minstrels and had little interest in statecraft. =Kade Carrion= Also known as Princess Katherine Fontainon, she is the bastard daughter of King Fulstan and Moire, the Queen of Air and Darkness, a powerful fay ruler in her own lands. Half-human and half-fay, Kade is a talented natural sorceress, and was reared in the royal palace in Vienne until she inadvertently unleashed her magic in a most destructive manner. Neglected and abused by King Fulstan, she shared a bond with Roland, who also suffered at the hands of their father. Decidedly un-regal, she eschews the trappings of her royal station, much to the annoyance of Queen Ravenna. She is ultimately rejected from the royal palace and court life. At the beginning of The Element of Fire, she has assumed her mother's title and station. =The Queen in The Death of the Necromancer= A descendant of Queen Ravenna, she rules Ile-Rien during 'The Death of the Necromancer.' Her name has not been revealed. In that book, she is an unmarried young woman who \\"uses candor like a loaded pistol,\\" and is sharp witted and observant. She suggests, only half- jestingly, that she marry Nicholas Valiarde for dynastic reasons. In The Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy, the same, yet-unnamed, queen rules, and has evidently married. She is the mother of at least two children, Prince Ilaron and Princess Olympe. As the invasion progresses, and the conquest of Vienne seems imminent, the queen makes arrangements to relocate the government and set up in exile in neighboring Parscia. Fearful of being able to safely make her escape, she separates the royal family, sending her children away via different routes, along with various government documents and items of regalia. =Prince Ilaron= The older child of the ruling queen in The Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy. In The Ships of Air, it was revealed that the Queen, fearful of being able to escape to Parscia to establish a government-in-exile against the onslaught of the Gardier, separated the royal family. Prince Ilaron was sent away with trusted ministers to escape via the railroads. He is the Crown Prince of Ile-Rien. =Princess Olympe= The younger child of the ruling queen in The Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy. In The Ships of Air, it was revealed that the Queen, fearful of being able to escape to Parscia to establish a government-in-exile against the onslaught of the Gardier, separated the royal family. Princess Olympe was sent with trusted ministers such as Count Delphane and Lady Aviler, her duenna, to escape aboard the Queen Ravenna. Included in the princess' baggage was King Fulstan's coronation crown, as well as the royal charter. The Queen's Guard Originally a body of armsmen placed directly at the command of the Queen of Ile-Rien, they have a celebrated history of valor and courage. They are a different body than the Royal Guard, which serves at the direction of the King of Ile-Rien. They are headquartered within the royal palace in Vienne. At the beginning of The Element of Fire, they are both an elite armed force and the queen's personal bodyguard. In later books, they have developed into an intelligence gathering agency, as well as remaining the bodyguard of the queen and her chosen designees, often guarding them covertly. =Thomas Boniface= The captain of the Queen's Guard and one of the main characters in The Element of Fire. He was once Queen Ravenna's lover and remains a dedicated protector until the end of her life. At the end of the Element of Fire, he falls in love with the half-fey princess Kade Carrion. The Valiarde Family A family of wealthy commoners in the beau monde of Ile-Rien, they are descended from the infamous exiled traitor, Denzil, Duke of Alsene. Their primary residence is the sprawling, ramshackle manor house, Coldcourt, outside of Vienne. They become known as a family of eccentric scholars and art collectors. =Nicholas Valiarde= A descendant of the infamous traitor Denzil, Duke of Alsene, his mother Sylvaine Valiarde married into the Alsene family, only to ultimately reject her husband and flee with her infant son, Nicholas, to Vienne, the capital. They live in poverty until she dies, and then Nicholas moves out on the streets as the leader of a gang, until he gets caught. A natural philosopher and widower in need of an intelligent heir, Edouard Villier, takes him out of prison and raises him. Nicholas ends up at Lodun, studying to become a doctor, until Edouard is arrested, tried, and eventually hung for necromancy, despite the fact that he wasn't even a sorcerer. Knowing that his foster father was innocent, Nicholas becomes obsessed with killing Count Rive Montesq, the man who framed Edouard. Nicholas was raised under the surname 'Valiarde,' although his true lineage was no great secret. In Death of the Necromancer, he lives the life of a callow ne'er-do-well art collector, while living a daring double life as 'Donatien,' a mysterious master-thief bedevilling the mansions and galleries of Ile-Rien. His lover, later wife, was Madeline, a celebrated actress who also dabbled in his life of masquerades and thievery. While he was unmarried the Young Fontainon Queen only half-jestingly suggested that she may marry him, since he would be a fitting consort due to his once-regal bloodlines. In the Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy, Nicholas has disappeared, leaving his daughter by Madeline, Tremaine, the sole possessor of Coldcourt. He is later revealed to be a spy against the Gardier. =Tremaine Valiarde= The sullen, moody yet highly intelligent daughter of Nicholas and Madeline, she is the main character in the Fall of Ile-Rien trilogy, as a researcher in a covert government project trying to unlock the secrets of Gardier weaponry. She is the sole possessor of Coldcourt, and the object of several unwelcome suitors. Tremaine is able to use one of her Valiarde heirlooms, an Arisilde Sphere, to discern the origins of The Gardier and the nature of their magical weapons. She begins to travel between the world in which Ile-Rien is situated, the world of the Syprians, and the homeworld of the Gardier. She later takes refuge on the Queen Ravenna.

Such morphisms, that are flat and surjective, are common, one example coming from an open cover. In practice, from an affine point of view, this technique allows one to prove some statement about a ring or scheme after faithfully flat base change. \\"Vanilla\\" faithfully flat descent is generally false; instead, faithfully flat descent is valid under some finiteness conditions (e.g., quasi-compact or locally of finite presentation). A faithfully flat descent is a special case of Beck's monadicity theorem.  Basic form  Let A \\\\to B be a faithfully flat ring homomorphism. Given an A-module M, we get the B-module N = M \\\\otimes_A B and because A \\\\to B is faithfully flat, we have the inclusion M \\\\hookrightarrow M \\\\otimes_A B. Moreover, we have the isomorphism \\\\varphi : N \\\\otimes B \\\\overset{\\\\sim}\\\\to N \\\\otimes B of B^{\\\\otimes 2}-modules that is induced by the isomorphism B^{\\\\otimes 2} \\\\simeq B^{\\\\otimes 2}, x \\\\otimes y \\\\mapsto y \\\\otimes x and that satisfies the cocycle condition: :\\\\varphi^1 = \\\\varphi^0 \\\\circ \\\\varphi^2 where \\\\varphi^i : N \\\\otimes B^{\\\\otimes 2} \\\\overset{\\\\sim}\\\\to N \\\\otimes B^{\\\\otimes 2} are given as: :\\\\varphi^0(n \\\\otimes b \\\\otimes c) = \\\\rho^1(b) \\\\varphi(n \\\\otimes c) :\\\\varphi^1(n \\\\otimes b \\\\otimes c) = \\\\rho^2(b) \\\\varphi(n \\\\otimes c) :\\\\varphi^2(n \\\\otimes b \\\\otimes c) = \\\\varphi(n \\\\otimes b) \\\\otimes c with \\\\rho^i(x)(y_0 \\\\otimes \\\\cdots \\\\otimes y_r) = y_0 \\\\cdots y_{i-1} \\\\otimes x \\\\otimes y_i \\\\cdots y_r. Note the isomorphisms \\\\varphi^i : N \\\\otimes B^{\\\\otimes 2} \\\\overset{\\\\sim}\\\\to N \\\\otimes B^{\\\\otimes 2} are determined only by \\\\varphi and do not involve M. Now, the most basic form of faithfully flat descent says that the above construction can be reversed; i.e., given a B-module N and a B^{\\\\otimes 2}-module isomorphism \\\\varphi : N \\\\otimes B \\\\overset{\\\\sim}\\\\to N \\\\otimes B such that \\\\varphi^1 = \\\\varphi^0 \\\\circ \\\\varphi^2, an invariant submodule: :M = \\\\\\\\{ n \\\\in N  \\\\varphi(n \\\\otimes 1) = n \\\\otimes 1 \\\\\\\\} \\\\subset N is such that M \\\\otimes B = N.  Zariski descent  The Zariski descent refers simply to the fact that a quasi-coherent sheaf can be obtained by gluing those on a (Zariski-)open cover. It is a special case of a faithfully flat descent but is frequently used to reduce the descent problem to the affine case. In details, let \\\\mathcal{Q}coh(X) denote the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on a scheme X. Then Zariski descent states that, given quasi-coherent sheaves F_i on open subsets U_i \\\\subset X with X = \\\\bigcup U_i and isomorphisms \\\\varphi_{ij} : F_i _{U_i \\\\cap U_j} \\\\overset{\\\\sim}\\\\to F_j _{U_i \\\\cap U_j} such that (1) \\\\varphi_{ii} = \\\\operatorname{id} and (2) \\\\varphi_{ik} = \\\\varphi_{jk} \\\\circ \\\\varphi_{ij} on U_i \\\\cap U_j \\\\cap U_k, then exists a unique quasi-coherent sheaf F on X such that F_{U_i} \\\\simeq F_i in a compatible way (i.e., F_{U_j} \\\\simeq F_j restricts to F_{U_i \\\\cap U_j} \\\\simeq F_i_{U_i \\\\cap U_j} \\\\overset{\\\\varphi_{ij}}\\\\underset{\\\\sim}\\\\to F_j_{U_i \\\\cap U_j}).; NB: since \\"quasi-coherent\\" is a local property, gluing quasi-coherent sheaves results in a quasi-coherent one. In a fancy language, the Zariski descent states that, with respect to the Zariski topology, \\\\mathcal{Q}coh is a stack; i.e., a category \\\\mathcal{C} equipped with the functor p : \\\\mathcal{C} \\\\to the category of (relative) schemes that has an effective descent theory. Here, let \\\\mathcal{Q}coh denote the category consisting of pairs (U, F) consisting of a (Zariski)-open subset U and a quasi-coherent sheaf on it and p the forgetful functor (U, F) \\\\mapsto U.  Descent for quasi-coherent sheaves  There is a succinct statement for the major result in this area: (the prestack of quasi- coherent sheaves over a scheme S means that, for any S-scheme X, each X-point of the prestack is a quasi-coherent sheaf on X.) The proof uses Zariski descent and the faithfully flat descent in the affine case.

Biography He was born in Tbilisi, the polyglot capital of the Russian Empire's territories in the Transcaucasus, on February 14, 1916, (although the shift to the Gregorian calendar a couple of years later made his birthday February 27). A sickly child, he was mostly tutored at home until he took a course in chemistry at a vocational school. Having learnt German and English in addition to his Armenian, Georgian and Russian, Shaumyan took his degree in philology at Tbilisi State University. At some time in the late 1930s he came across Ferdinand de Saussure's Course in General Linguistics (1916) and, captivated, knew his academic course was set. World War II briefly interrupted his scholarly aspirations, as he became embroiled in the battles for twice Nazi-occupied Kerch. He applied for a front-line posting, but instead he was sent to the Main Intelligence Unit in Moscow (GRU), where he was permitted to pursue his studies. He was a Party member and, with a post at Moscow State University, used his position to help, and sometimes to shelter, those who might be accused of the various crimes of formalism or idealism. Shaumyan published Structural Linguistics in 1965 and founded the Section of Structural Linguistics at the Institute of Russian Language in Moscow, where he co-wrote many works with Polina Arkadievana Soboleva. He promoted the work of Roman Jakobson and Nikolai Trubetzkoy, both of whom were out of favour (one an √©migr√©, the other a prince). He also defended the \\"formalist\\", Noam Chomsky, (whom later he vigorously assailed) in Fundamentals of the Generative Grammar of Russian (1958), and Applicational Generative Model and Transformational Calculus of Russian (1963), both written with Soboleva. In 1968 Shaumyan spent a year in Edinburgh and in 1975 was able to join the wave of Jewish emigration permitted at that time, joining Yale's faculty of linguistics. Shaumyan's theory of applicative grammar was developed, reinforced, and extended in Applicational Grammar as a Semiotic Theory of Natural Language, (1977); in A Semiotic Theory of Language (1987); and finally in Signs, Mind, and Reality (2006, in the series Advances in Consciousness Research), with the intriguing subtitle A Theory of Language As the Folk Model of the World. To his chagrin, he was superannuated by Yale in 1986, but maintained, as Emeritus, a vigorous and very productive retirement. His bibliography contains a dozen books, some two hundred papers, and he was active on the conference circuit. In 2005, approaching 90, he returned to Moscow as a Fulbright scholar (but was refused a visa for a longer stay.) Shaumyan's later work is marked by a broad interest in the philosophy of science, in foundational questions of linguistics and in related but separate studies of consciousness theory, and neurolinguistics. It is sharply critical of Chomsky, who Shaumyan saw as being unable to properly delineate what pertains to the study of linguistics proper. The list of languages cited in his last book gives evidence of the breadth of his interests; they include Basque, the endangered Australian language of Dyirbal, and the extinct Oregon Indian Takelma.  Applicative Universal Grammar (AUG)  The core of Shaumyan's linguistic theory is Applicative Universal Grammar or AUG. The theory was first introduced in his book Strukturnaja lingvistika (Structural Linguistics), published in Moscow in 1965. AUG is based on combinatorial logic and grammatical categories which are built from two primitive universal types, called a term (T) and a sentence (S), which exist in every language. A term represents a noun or a noun phrase: for example \\"dog\\", \\"a dog\\", \\"a big dog\\" would all be considered terms. \\"A dog runs\\" would be a complete sentence. The verb \\"runs\\" is an operator that acts upon the operand term \\"a dog\\" and transforms it into a complete sentence \\"a dog runs\\". In Shaumyan's operator notation the verb \\"runs\\" would be represented symbolically as OTS. Recently, AUG has been used in computational linguistics in the development of a natural language parsing program, using the programming language Haskell. Natural language parsing has important applications in machine translation of sentences from one language into another.

They were first identified in 1979 by Margaret Wong-Riley when she used a cytochrome oxidase stain, from which they get their name. These areas receive input from parvocellular cells in layer 4CŒ≤ of the primary visual cortex and output to the thin stripes of area V2. Interblobs are areas between blobs which receive the same input, but are sensitive to orientation instead of color. They output to the pale stripes of area V2. Blobs are on the parvocellular pathway. This pathway begins at the photoreceptors which then relay signals to the 'P' ganglion cells in the retina. The pathway then continues out of the eye to layers 3-6 of the lateral geniculate nucleus (shortened to LGN). This pathway then terminates at the blobs in V1. Lesioning of the parvocellular pathway leads to lack of acuity in shapes and colour.

Originally built by Finnish State Railways in the Grand Duchy of Finland, the railway was part of a trunk line from Vaasa by the Gulf of Botnia to St. Petersburg. In the 1940 Moscow Peace Treaty the territory was ceded by Finland to the Soviet Union. The railroad is now operated by the Russian Railways. The railroad is used by passenger trains between St. Petersburg and Sortavala. The track between Khiytola and Sortavala is a part of the Vyborg‚ÄìJoensuu railroad completed in 1894. As the Russian part of the Riihim√§ki‚ÄìSaint Petersburg railway is planned to be renovated to handle high-speed international trains operated by Karelian Trains and to be used exclusively for passenger traffic, so the cargo traffic between Finland and Russia‚Äîmostly lumber, granite rubble and oil‚Äîis expected to be switched to the Saint Petersburg‚ÄìHiitola railroad. This would make the railway a part of the Northern East-West Freight Corridor. History The railway connected Hiitola (Khiytola) on the Vyborg‚ÄìJoensuu railway with Finland Station in St. Petersburg, bypassing the Riihim√§ki‚ÄìVyborg‚ÄìSaint Petersburg trunk line of Finnish railways. Construction of the railway had been completed by January 1917, although some works continued until 1919. The line was constructed from Rautu (Sosnovo) to Hiitola, as single line railway which is used in both directions.This makes the traffic logistically inefficient, although there are a number of short multi-track sections at some key stations (Pet√§j√§rvi, Gromovo, Myllypelto, Priozersk, Kuznechnoye). The part of the railway south of Raasuli (Orekhovo) was on the Russian side of the Finnish-Russian border. In 1918, after Finnish independence and during the Finnish Civil War, communications between Finland and Soviet Russia ceased. In spring 1918, troops under Georg Elfvengren blew up the track to prevent supplies reaching Red Guard units operating near Rautu.–ò—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—è –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –ø—É–Ω–∫—Ç–æ–≤ - –ü—Ä–∏–æ–∑–µ—Ä—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ —Ä–∞–π–æ–Ω–∞ –õ–µ–Ω–∏–Ω–≥—Ä–∞–¥—Å–∫–æ–π –æ–±–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ Kannaksen sankari The railway was cut between Nuijala (67th km) and Lembolovo and 1.7 kilometers of track was removed on the Finnish side.Rautu - Pieni Tietosanakirja, page 1171 The Leningrad ‚Äì Lembolovo part became part of NKPS Soviet Railways 1919 - 1939. This section was operated by at first by Nikolai Railway and later, after name change, the October Railway. In 1940, after the Winter War and again in 1944 after the Continuation War the Karelian Isthmus with the railway was ceded to the Soviet Union in the Moscow Peace Treaty, Moscow Armistice and Paris Peace Treaty. In 1939, as the war had begun, the population along the railway was evacuated, mostly to Pieks√§m√§ki. In 1941 some of them returned. In June 1944 during the final stages of the Continuation War, a train of Karelian evacuees was bombed by the Soviet Air Force in Pet√§j√§rvi. The second parallel track between Sosnovo and Losevo, which is expected to be linked to Kamennogorsk and Vyborg, has been under construction since 2008 to handle the increasing freight traffic bypassing the connection between Saint Petersburg and Vyborg.

Further, after Piskaryovka, the road branches into three ways, two others heading south and east. After Murino there is a link to Pargolovo (Vyborg direction), along which a section of the Saint Petersburg Ring Road has been constructed. By 1930 in Finland a railroad linking Viipuri (Vyborg), Heinjoki (Veshchevo), Ristsepp√§l√§ (Zhitkovo) and Valkj√§rvi (Michurinskoye) had been built, which was expected to be continued to Rautu (Sosnovo). The Russians started to build the missing section between Rautu and Valkj√§rvi. The Finns considered also to build this missing link but they found the difference in turns of highest maximum up grade too big (Valkj√§rvi station was 111.89 metre above sea level). The up grade from River Saija would have been more than 15 pro mille. That was too much for this proposed line and the project was cancelled. In 1941 6 km of the track bed had been completed by the Russians in August 1941. This section was never completed. However, in the 1950s Soviet authorities demolished the track between Zhitkovo and Michurinskoye, but the track bed remains, and the rails between Veshchevo and Zhitkovo were also dismantled in 2001. However, the roadbed from Veshchevo to Sosnovo has remained until now. At K√§kisalmi was a short industrial railway to German owned Waldhof Cellulose Factory. This line was connected with VR built short K√§kisalmi Harbour Line. As of 2007, projects are being discussed to construct a cargo railway along the northern shore of the Vuoksi River from Losevo to Kamennogorsk to ship crude oil to the sea port of Primorsk bypassing the Saint Petersburg ‚Äì Vyborg line. An alternative is reconstruction of the Sosnovo ‚Äì Michurinskoye ‚Äì Zhitkovo ‚Äì Vyborg railway. The old Karelian railroad links Vyborg and Kamennogorsk (in turn linked by railway to Imatra, Finland) to Hiitola. Besides, a number of short military and industrial railways a few km long branch off from this line, e.g. a track between Orekhovo and Lembolovo westwards to Steklyannyi (Riskanm√§ki), between Gruzino and 47th km eastwards, between Otradnoye and Myllypelto westwards. At Priozersk eastwards to the Priozersk Pulp and Paper Mill, (former Waldhof Factory), as well as at Kuznechnoye (Kaarlahti) to the shore of Lake Ladoga) harbour. Trains Cargo train The railway is used to ship petroleum to the ports of the Gulf of Finland through Hiitola, lumber and iron ore pellets from Karelia, as well as granite rubble from Kuznechnoye. Besides, it is a popular passenger line. =Passenger trains= Electric ::(elektrichkas) :Saint Petersburg ‚Äì Vaskelovo (about 1 h 25 min with all stops as of 2007) :Saint Petersburg ‚Äì Sosnovo (about 2 h with all stops as of 2007) :Saint Petersburg ‚Äì Priozersk (about 2 h 50 min with all stops as of 2007) :Saint Petersburg ‚Äì Kuzhechnoye (about 3 h 25 min with all stops as of 2007) :Devyatkino ‚Äì Vaskelovo (about 50 min with all stops as of 2007) :Devyatkino ‚Äì Sosnovo (about 1 h 20 min with all stops as of 2007) :Kuznechnoye ‚Äì Sortavala (about 25 min from Kuznechnoye to Hiitola with all stops as of 2007) Diesel-engined :Saint Petersburg (Ladozhsky Rail Terminal) ‚Äì Hiitola ‚Äì Sortavala ‚Äì Kostomuksha (about 3 h 35 m from Saint Petersburg to Hiitola) Accidents In 1983 in Sosnovo there was a cargo train crash resulting in a large oil spill.

His bows are marked \\"E.SARTORY A PARIS\\". The apex of the trend toward heavy, strong bows was exemplified in the output of Eug√®ne Sartory, who developed a style of bow to which his atelier adhered consistently for decades. He fortified the Voirin model, producing sturdily built bows with strong shafts. Later on Sartory innovated the design of his bows; widening the head and altering the shaft cross-section as well as thickening the shaft above the handle. These changes provided more stability and reliability in the handling. In his early period, Sartory preferred dark pernambuco wood, whereas the later bows are generally of lighter color. Vigneron and Fetique produced bows that at times could rival a Sartory in terms of strength and handling, but the consistency of Sartory bows has made them a perennial favorite among musicians even if they lack some of the subtlety of older bows. Sartory bows are utterly reliable as playing tools and will satisfy a wide variety of players. His list of assistants includes Louis Morizot (per√®), Jules Fetique & Louis Gillet.

It has a fragmented storyline as the title suggests, and chronicles several seemingly unrelated stories in parallel. These separate narrative lines intersect in an incident at the end of the film: a mass killing at an Austrian bank. The film is set in Vienna from October to December of 1993. Haneke refers to 71 Fragments of a Chronology of Chance as the last part of his \\"glaciation trilogy\\", the other parts of which are his preceding two films The Seventh Continent and Benny's Video. Plot The film opens with intertitles which introduce the mass killing in detail. It then chronicles in flashbacks the previous few months of several people in Vienna. A young Romanian boy sneaks across the border at night, wading through a swamp and hiding in the back of a truck. In Vienna he lives on the streets as a beggar. A security worker makes pickups at a bank. At home he argues with his wife and says prayers at great length. A young man steals weapons from a military armory. A college student plays games with his friends in which they bet against each other. He bets his watch against a stolen pistol. An old man sits at home watching TV, talking at great length to his adult daughter who is too busy to spend time with him. A married couple tries to adopt a young girl. The Romanian boy is picked up by authorities and his story receives news coverage. He is taken in by the couple who wanted to adopt the girl. While out doing errands, the wife leaves him in the car while she goes inside the bank. At the same time, the old man goes to the bank under the guise of picking up his pension, but he's really there to see his daughter who work there. The college student stops for gas. Short on cash, he goes across the street to use the ATM, but it is out of order. Stressed out and in a rush, he goes inside the crowded bank and attempts to cut to the front of the line, but he is assaulted by another customer. He leaves the bank and walks back to his car where he retrieves his gun. He returns to the bank, where he begins firing indiscriminately at the people inside. He then walks back to his car and shoots himself. Characters The drama consists of varied characters in each storyline: a Romanian boy who immigrated illegally into Austria and lives on the streets of Vienna; a religious bank security worker; a lonely old man staring at a TV screen; a childless couple considering adoption; a frustrated student and so on. Film division The film is divided into a number of variable-length \\"fragments\\" separated by black pauses and apparently unrelated to each other. The film is characterized by several fragments that take the form of video newscasts unrelated to the main storylines. News footages of real events are shown through video monitors. Newscasts report on the Bosnian War, the Somali Civil War, the South Lebanon conflict, the Kurdish‚ÄìTurkish conflict, and molestation allegations against Michael Jackson.

One nautical historian called Arizona \\"a souped up transatlantic hot rod.\\" Entering service in 1879, she was the prototype for Atlantic express liners until the Inman Line introduced its twin screw City of New York in 1889. The Arizona type liner is generally considered as unsuccessful because too much was sacrificed for speed. Laid up in 1894 when Guion stopped sailings, Arizona was sold four years later and briefly employed in the Pacific until she was acquired by the US Government for service in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. As the U.S. Navy's Hancock she continued trooping through W.W.I. and was finally scrapped in 1926. Development and design Starting in 1866, the Guion Line was successful in the Liverpool-Queenstown- New York steerage trade. In 1875, Guion began commissioning express liners to compete for first class business, but its first two ships were total failures. William Pearce, the controlling partner of the John Elder shipyard, was convinced that a crack steamer that carried only passengers and light freight could be profitable because she would attract more passengers and spend less time in port. When Cunard rejected his proposal, Pearce offered his idea to the Guion line at a bargain price of ¬£140,000 at a time when express liners typically cost ¬£200,000. He also agreed to share the initial costs. Stephen Guion, managing director of the line, personally owned the new vessel. As completed, Arizona appeared similar to White Star's Germanic, the current holder of the Blue Riband, but with greater power. Her engines produced 6,400 indicated horsepower, 1,400 more than Germanic. Arizona's six double-ended boilers and 39 furnaces consumed 135 tons of coal per day, considerably more than her White Star rival. She also had less room for cargo and steerage passengers. Because of her high power, Arizona was an uncomfortable ship. However, publicity at the time tried to hide this by describing the luxury of her interior. Her saloon \\"contained six long tables, with revolving chairs. A large dome-like aperture, with a skylight at the top, rose from the centre of the saloon, and was crossed by beams, supported by small pillars of polished wood, upon which were placed plants and flowers. The saloon extended the entire width of the vessel, and contained a fine piano at the forward end, and a library at the after end. The state-rooms were elegantly upholstered, and contained every facility for comfort. Pneumatic bells connected all the state- rooms with the steward's pantry, which was situated just aft the main saloon. A richly-furnished ladies' boudoir was on the promenade deck, just aft of the forward wheel-house.\\" Service history Arizona's bow after her 1879 collision with an iceberg.Shortly after her 1879 maiden voyage, Arizona won the eastbound record for a Sandy Hook-Queenstown run of seven days, eight hours, 11 minutes (15.96 knots). However, despite her greater power and coal consumption, she failed to take the westbound \\"Blue Riband\\" record from Germanic. On 7 November 1879, Arizona suffered a collision with an iceberg en route to Liverpool. Stephen Guion was on board with two of his nieces. It was found that the ship was holding an insufficient watch in the bow, with most of the deck crew positioned on or around the bridge. Fortunately, while she was going at full speed, the ship's top speed was only about 15 knots, so the damage was not threatening.http://www.norwayheritage.com/articles/templates/great- disasters.asp?articleid=141&zoneid;=1 As such, she remained afloat and was able to proceed to St. John's where she underwent temporary repairs before returning to Scotland. Guion advertised this near disaster as proof of Arizona's strength. In 1897, Arizona was rebuilt with one funnel and served the U.S. Government as the USAT and USS Hancock until after the First World War. While uncomfortable, Arizona proved popular with American passengers because the Guion Line was majority owned by Americans. Stephen Guion died in December 1885, and the line was reorganized as a public stock corporation to settle the estate. The company did not invest in new units and by 1894 when Guion stopped sailings, Arizona and her running mate, Alaska of 1881 were hopelessly outpaced by the latest twin-screw liners from Cunard, White Star and Inman. It was on the Arizona that Oscar Wilde first sailed to America, arriving in New York on 2 January 1882. On 23 October 1882 he welcomed his friend Lillie Langtry on her arrival in New York on the Arizona. Arizona was laid up in Scotland until 1897 when she was sold to a British flagged San Francisco-China service. She was extensively rebuilt and her two funnels were replaced with one enormous funnel that dominated her profile. After a few Pacific voyages, Arizona was sold to the War Department and used designated U.S.Army Transport (USAT) Arizona. =Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War service= In 1898 USAT Arizona was refitted and new triple expansion steam engines replaced her old compound engines in preparation for the San Francisco to China route. On 16 July 1898 Arizona was purchased from the Northern Pacific Railway Company by the U.S. Army for $600,000. USAT Arizona transported the following United States Volunteers (USV) and Regular Army units from Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii to Manila, Philippines as part of the 5th (US) Philippine Expeditionary Force in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War: * 1st Colorado (National Guard) Infantry Regiment, USV (1st Battalion, 2nd Battalion and Company C). * 1st Nebraska (National Guard) Infantry Regiment, USV (part). * 10th Pennsylvania (National Guard) Infantry Regiment, USV (part). * 18th U.S. Infantry, Companies I, K, L, M.The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Centennial Website.

It sailed with the USAT Rosecrans. In 1902, she was acquired by the US Navy for use as a receiving ship at the Brooklyn Navy Yard and commissioned as USS Hancock. She served as a troopship in the First World War and continued in various duties until she was sold for scrapping in May 1926.

Overview The Science Museum originally took ownership of the 545-acre former RAF Wroughton airfield in 1979, to be used as a storage facility for the largest objects of the Science Museum. A collection of approximately 35,000 objects is currently stored in six of the hangars and a purpose-built store. These include the world's first hovercraft, MRI scanners, computers, (de-activated) nuclear missiles and much more. In 2007 the collection of the Science Museum Library and Archives was also relocated to new facilities at the site. In 2016 the site started to be featured in The Grand Tour, a motoring entertainment show. The show's three ex 'Top Gear' hosts use some of the roads surrounding the museum buildings as a vehicle test track each week. In 2018 the site was rebranded as the National Collections Centre to reflect the use of the facility by the Science Museum Group as its primary collections management facility. 2019 saw the start of construction for a new 26,000m2 purpose-built facility which will eventually house and provide access to over 400,000 objects from the collection. Functions of the National Collections Centre =Collections Management= The primary focus of the National Collections Centre is to conserve and manage the collections of the Science Museum Group. Over 35,000 large objects are currently housed at the site in the former aircraft hangars. The Science Museum Group, the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum had previously used Blythe House in London as storage, but have to move out. The Science Museum Group will use ¬£40m from the government to develop the National Collections Centre site and create a high-quality accessible facility for the management of the collection, in addition to storage, the building will contain conservation labs and research facilities. Until completion of the new collections management facility in 2023 the object collections at the facility are not normally open to the public. Some of the objects in the collection currently stored at the National Collections Centre: *Douglas DC3 aircraft *Ford Edsel motor car *Boeing 247 aircraft *Handley Page Gugnunc biplane *Lockheed Constellation airliner * A double-decker bus * A TV detector van * The world‚Äôs first amphibious hovercraft * Early 20th-century electric vehicles *The Wood Press, the last hot metal printing press in Fleet Street =Library and Archives= The Science Museum Library & Archives collections are part of the Science Museum in London. Its holdings include original scientific, technical and medical works from the last 500 years. The Library is free to use and open to the public but appointments to visit have to be booked in advance. It is open on Fridays 10.00-17.00. The Science Museum Library was founded in 1883 as the Science Library of the South Kensington Museum. It was formed of collections from the South Kensington Educational Library and the library of the Museum of Practical Geology. In 1907 it moved to the Royal College of Science building. When the Science Museum gained its independence in 1909, the Science Library became its responsibility. In 1992 the Library joined with Imperial College London to form the Imperial College & Science Museum Libraries. Due to the increasing demand for space in South Kensington, about 85% of the collections and all of the archives moved to a specially adapted library building at Wroughton, Swindon in 2007. The library in London closed in February 2014; all of its collections were moved to the Library in Wroughton Science Museum Library & Archives at Wroughton.jpgScience Museum Library & Archives at Wroughton Reading room at the Science Museum Library & Archives, Wroughton.jpgReading room at the Science Museum Library & Archives, Wroughton Wroughton library encyclopedia.jpgSome of the encyclopaedias in the library The Library collections The printed collections include rare books and first editions, journals from the 16th to the 20th centuries, Trade Literature, exhibition catalogues, British patents from 1617‚Äì1992 as well as over 85,000 books focussing on the history and social aspects of science, technology and medicine The named archive collections include old original archives of some of the most famous and influential individuals and companies in the fields of science, medicine, engineering and industry.

Life Born in Carson City, Michigan, US, Knott received his MFA from Norwich University and studied with John Logan in Chicago. His first collection of poems, The Naomi Poems: Corpse and Beans, was published in 1968 under the name Saint Geraud, a fictional persona whose backstory included a suicide two years prior to the publishing. The Naomi Poems was well received and brought him to the attention of such poets as James Wright, who called him an \\"unmistakable genius.\\" Knott taught at Emerson College for more than 25 years, published many books of poetry, and was awarded the Iowa Poetry Prize and a Guggenheim fellowship. Work Early in his career, Knott was noted for writing unusually short poems, some as short as one line, and untitled. Later he became interested in metrical verse forms and syllabics. He was not a believer in poetic \\"branding\\" and throughout his career refused to restrict himself to one particular school or style of writing. His poetry's subjects, themes and tones were also wide-ranging. His work often displayed a wry, self- deprecating sense of humor, and he was critical of what he saw as an epidemic of humorlessness in contemporary American poetry. Poets who cite him as an influence include Thomas Lux, Mary Karr, Stephen Dobyns, Denise Duhamel, Denis Johnson, and Janaka Stucky. One of Johnson's novels, Already Dead: A California Gothic, was inspired by Knott's \\"Poem Noir.\\" A selection of his work, I Am Flying Into Myself: Selected Poems, 1960-2014, was compiled by Thomas Lux and published by Farrar, Straus and Giroux in February 2017.

It emerged as a subdivision of the Principality of Anhalt from 1252 until 1396, when it was divided into the principalities of Anhalt-Dessau and Anhalt- K√∂then. Recreated in 1544, Anhalt-Zerbst finally was partitioned between Anhalt-Dessau, Anhalt-K√∂then, and Anhalt-Bernburg in 1796 upon the extinction of the line. History It was created when the Anhalt territory was divided among the sons of Prince Henry I into the principalities of Anhalt- Aschersleben, Anhalt-Bernburg and Anhalt-Zerbst in 1252. In the course of the partition, Prince Siegfried I, the youngest son of Henry I, received the lands around K√∂then, Dessau, and Zerbst. His son and successor Prince Albert I took his residence at K√∂then Castle in 1295. In 1396, the surviving sons of Prince John II of Anhalt-Zerbst again divided their heritage: Sigismund I became Prince of Anhalt-Dessau and his younger brother Albert IV went on to rule as Prince of Anhalt-K√∂then. Ruins of Zerbst Castle The principality was recreated, when in 1544 the heirs of Prince Ernest I of Anhalt-Dessau divided their territory and the eldest surviving son, Prince John V, took his residence at Zerbst Castle. The second incarnation, however, lost a lot of territory in 1603 when it was partitioned for a second time with some of its territory being given to Anhalt-Dessau, Anhalt-Bernburg, Anhalt-Pl√∂tzkau and Anhalt-K√∂then. By 1606, all Anhalt principalities had turned to the Reformed faith, however, Anhalt-Zerbst returned to Lutheranism in 1644. In 1667, Prince John VI inherited the remote Lordship of Jever in East Frisia. Upon his death in the same year, however, Anhalt-Zerbst lost more of its territory, with Anhalt-M√ºhlingen and Anhalt-Dornburg being created. The Jever lordship was administrated by Ascanian relatives, it was hit hard by the Christmas Flood of 1717. In 1742 princes John Louis II and Christian August of Anhalt-Zerbst- Dornburg inherited Anhalt-Zerbst. After Christian August's death in 1747, his widow Johanna Elisabeth of Holstein-Gottorp governed the country for her son Frederick Augustus until 1752. She had the new castle at Dornburg built as her thirds from 1750, a lavish baroque palace prepared to host her brother, Adolf Frederick, King of Sweden, or her daughter Sophie Auguste Fredericka, who in 1745 had married the Russian crown prince Peter III, to become empress in 1762, better known as Catherine the Great. However, neither of them ever visited her, and the dowager princess and her son were forced into exile when Prussian forces invaded Anhalt-Zerbst during the Seven Years' War in 1758. Frederick the Great, who had actually proposed the Russian marriage, accused the princess and her son to support Russia, then his war enemy. Johanna Elisabeth died in Paris in 1760 and her son, Frederick Augustus, never returned to Zerbst and continued to live in Basel and Luxemburg. Upon his death in 1793, the Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst came to an end with its territory being divided among the Ascanian princes of Anhalt-Dessau, Anhalt- K√∂then, and Anhalt-Bernburg while Jever was inherited by his sister, Catherine the Great, and remained under Russian rule until 1818.

Other anchor stores that operated at the mall included Levitz Furniture, as well as Payless Cashways, a home improvement store.Antioch Center likes independent storesPayless Cashways (Google Finance) Antioch Center was also once home to the first location for ShowBiz Pizza Place,http://www.showbizpizza.com/info/articles/spp/spp_80kansascity.pdf and housed a branch of the Forum Cafeterias, the chain's first suburban location. In mid-1990s, the mall began a downward spiral and became increasingly vacant, until the only remaining stores were Sears, Burlington Coat Factory, and Catherine's Plus Sizes. Plans were announced in October 2004 to rebuild the dying mall as a open-air, mixed use complex, consisting of several big-box stores.Antioch Center's rebirth (brief article) This redevelopment was stymied by the economic recession of the late 2000s and was not carried out. Inside access to Antioch Center was ultimately blocked off and the mall sat empty for several years until it was finally demolished in January 2012, leaving only Sears and Burlington Coat Factory standing. In 2014, the center was renamed Antioch Crossing, and a redevelopment project began at the site. Walmart Neighborhood Market opened at the site in late 2014, while Vintage Stock and other retailers opened in 2015 and beyond.https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/biz-columns- blogs/cityscape/article4241427.html On May 16, 2017, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 30 stores nationwide. The store closed in July 2017.https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/biz- columns-blogs/cityscape/article150781562.html  See also  * References Category:Shopping malls established in 1956 Category:Shopping malls in Missouri Category:Economy of Kansas City, Missouri Category:Buildings and structures in Kansas City, Missouri Category:1956 establishments in Missouri Category:2012 disestablishments in Missouri ","title":"Antioch Crossing"},{"id":"10540087","text":"Ayer Shirley Regional High School is a high school located in Ayer, Massachusetts.

The highway runs for from a junction with Interstate 10 near Quartzsite to the New Mexico State Line near Springerville. As it crosses the state, US 60 overlaps at various points: I-17, I-10, SR 77, SR 260, US 191, and US 180. Between Wickenburg and Phoenix, the route is known as Grand Avenue (or the Phoenix‚ÄìWickenburg Highway). From Tempe to Apache Junction, it is known as the Superstition Freeway. Route description =I-10 to Wickenburg= The western terminus of US 60 is located at an interchange with I-10 east of Quartzite. It heads northeast from this junction to Vicksburg Junction where it curves towards the east. It continues to the east to Hope where it intersects SR 72. East of Hope, the highway briefly curves towards the north-northeast before curving towards the northeast. It continues this direction until it reaches Aguila. The highway heads east to an intersection with SR 71 after passing through Aguila. US 60 continues towards the east until it reaches Wickenburg and an intersection with US 93. From Wickenburg, the highway heads towards the southeast towards Phoenix. It has an intersection with SR 74 in Morristown as it continues towards the southeast. =Grand Avenue= As US 60 enters the Phoenix metropolitan area, It intersects Loop 303 in Surprise where it becomes Grand Avenue as it continues southeast. It continues to a junction with Loop 101 (Agua Fria Freeway) in Peoria before heading through Glendale. The highway enters the Phoenix city limits and continues towards the southeast until it reaches an interchange with 27th Avenue near Thomas Road. Improvements to the Grand Avenue portion of US 60, which were included in the Maricopa Association of Governments' 20-year Regional Transportation Plan, have been made. Among such improvements is the reducing of many of the busiest six-legged intersections to four-legged intersections by constructing overpasses, underpasses, and access roads. US 60 Marker =I-17/I-10 concurrencies= After briefly heading south along 27th Ave., US 60 turns left onto Thomas Rd. for until it reaches I-17. At I-17 the highway begins to run concurrently with I-17 towards the south. It passes through an I-10 interchange known as \\"The Stack.\\" US 60 continues to run concurrent with I-17 around the Durango Curve and continues east until it again reaches I-10 at the interchange known as \\"The Split.\\" US 60 begins to run concurrently towards the east with I-10 after the interchange. Along the freeway, US 60 passes along the south side of the airport and over a bridge traversing the Salt River. Once over the river, the freeway continues towards Tempe to an interchange with SR 143. The freeway curves back towards the south following the SR 143 interchange. =Superstition Freeway= After the curve, I-10 and US 60 part ways in Tempe, with I-10 continuing towards the south and US 60 now heading east along the Superstition Freeway. The freeway continues towards the east to a second interchange with Loop 101 (Price Freeway). The freeway enters Mesa city limits after the interchange as it continues towards the east to the SuperRedTan interchange with Loop 202. The freeway enters the city limits of Apache Junction in Pinal County as it continues eastbound. The freeway portion of the highway ends in Apache Junction as US 60 curves towards the southeast. =Apache Junction to the state line= US 60 Marker The highway continues towards the southeast passing through Gold Canyon to an interchange with SR 79 at Florence Junction. US 60 curves towards the east at this junction as it heads to Superior and an interchange with SR 177. From Superior the highway begins to head towards the northeast to Miami and Claypool. It continues to a junction with SR 188 before passing through Midland City and turning towards the south towards Globe. US 60 curves back towards the east in Globe and continues to an intersection with US 70 and SR 77. US 60 heads northeast from the intersection concurrent with SR 77. The two highways curve towards the north before curving back towards the northeast as they head towards Show Low. As the highway continues towards the northeast it enters the San Carlos Indian Reservation. Within the reservation, the highway goes through a series of hairpin turns as it enters the Salt River Canyon. After descending into the canyon, the highway passes over the Salt River and enters the Fort Apache Indian Reservation. The highway continues towards the northeast and enters Navajo County before reaching an intersection with SR 73. It continues northeast from this intersection to the city of Show Low. In Show Low, US 60 intersects SR 260 and briefly runs concurrently with SR 260 as it heads northeast through the city. The concurrency with SR 77 also ends in Show Low as SR 77 heads north to Snowflake and US 60 continues towards the east. US 60 leaves the Show Low city limits and heads east to a junction with SR 61 which heads northeast towards Concho. US 60 continues east from this intersection before curving towards the southeast as it heads towards Springerville. As it enters the Springerville city limits, it intersects and begins to run concurrently with US 180 and US 191. The three highways continue along the same alignment through Springerville, passing over the Little Colorado River. As the three highways continue through the city, they eventually split with US 180 and US 191 heading south towards Alpine and US 60 continuing towards the east. US 60 continues towards the east leaving the Springerville city limits and crossing over the state line into New Mexico. History In 1927, what is now US 60 was signed as or roughly followed by SR 74 between the California border near Ehrenburg and Wickenburg, US 89 from Wickenburg to Florence Junction, US 80 from Phoenix to Florence Junction, US 180 from Florence Junction to Globe and US 70 between Springerville and the New Mexico border. The segment of highway between Springerville and Globe had not been constructed yet. US 60 was extended into Arizona on June 8, 1931, from its original western terminus at US 66 in Springfield, Missouri. While what is now US 60 was under construction between Globe and Springerville, US 60 was temporarily routed down SR 73 as US 60T through San Carlos and McNary. The current route through Show Low was completed sometime between 1935 and 1938. US 60 through Arizona has had far fewer major changes than some other U.S. routes, but one notable example is being replaced by Interstate 10 between Los Angeles, California, and the highway's current terminus near Quartzsite. (The Arizona section of this route was decommissioned in 1982.) US 60 is now the only U.S. Route to serve Phoenix. US 70 (decommissioned 1969), US 80 (decommissioned 1977) & US 89 (decommissioned 1992) have all been truncated outside of Phoenix. The only other major change was being realigned from an \\"in-town\\" route along city arterials through Mesa, Tempe, and Phoenix to the old SR 360 alignment a few miles south and merging with I-10 and I-17 into Downtown Phoenix. The Pinto Creek Bridge in 1955.In 1949, the Pinto Creek Bridge won an Annual Award of Merit for being the \\"most beautiful steel bridge\\", given by the American Institute of Steel Construction. In 1952, the Claypool Tunnel was bypassed by the Queen Creek Tunnel to the north, upgrading from a simple 'hole in the rock' type tunnel to a more modern tunnel. =Recent improvements= US 60 shield used from 1926 to 1955 In recent years, Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) has been working to widen and improve US 60 through the Metropolitan Phoenix Area, as it is one of the area's principal freeways. Along the Superstition Freeway segment in the East Valley between I-10 and Loop 202, ADOT has completed its project of adding additional general purpose lanes (five total plus an HOV lane in each direction), adding auxiliary lanes between exits, improving sound barriers, replacing signs, improving lighting conditions, adding rubberized asphalt to reduce noise, adding variable message signs, installing cameras, and adding traffic sensors. A new partial interchange at Meridian Road, along the Maricopa‚ÄìPinal county line, opened in October 2015. Along the Grand Avenue segment in Phoenix, ADOT has been widening portions of Grand Avenue in addition to constructing additional overpasses and underpasses at six former six-way intersections to improve traffic flow along US 60 in the Northwest Valley.US 60 (Grand Avenue) ADOT is currently in the study phase of adding additional lanes between Loop 101 and Loop 303 in the far West Valley. Future Due to rapid growth in the far eastern Phoenix suburbs within Pinal County and increasing road congestion in the Gold Canyon area, ADOT has begun to study potential freeway-grade realignments of US 60 past the current eastern terminus of the Superstition Freeway in Apache Junction. The new freeway alignment would bypass the existing at-grade section of US 60 through Gold Canyon, and would either rejoin the existing alignment southeast of town (in the vicinity of the Arizona Renaissance Festival grounds) or at the newly constructed freeway-grade junction with SR 79 at Florence Junction. Major junctions Notes Related route An unsigned U.S. Route 60X is also listed by ADOT is divided into two discontinuous segments, both of which are located within Maricopa County in the Phoenix area. Both sections of US 60X were portions of the pre-freeway alignment of US 60 between Apache Junction and central Phoenix. US 60X begins near Grand Avenue and Thomas Road at exit 160, where US 60 leaves Grand Avenue for Thomas Road. It then follows Grand Avenue southeast over I-17/US 60, terminating at an intersection with 18th Avenue and Willetta Street. The eastern segment of US 60X picks up at Sossaman Road, traveling east across Main Street/Apache Trail, crossing Loop 202 and Ellsworth Road before terminating at Meridian Drive, at the Pinal County line. =Major intersections= The eastern segment of US 60X has posted mile markers that likely correspond to the former alignment of US 60.

The original lake surface was 1,530 feet (466 m) above sea level, but when the river was dammed in 1900, the elevation was raised to 1,560 feet (475 m). Chester Morse Lake is more than four miles (6 km) long, and is primarily fed from the east by the north and south forks of the Cedar River, and from the south by the Rex River. The lake is part of the Seattle area water supply. Located in the upper watershed, Chester Morse Lake is impounded by the masonry dam and a secondary control structure called the Overflow Dike. The lake now functions as a water supply storage reservoir and powers a 30-megawatt hydroelectric facility. Chester Morse Lake was previously a natural lake called Cedar Lake. Cedar Lake was formed about 14,000 years ago by the terminal moraine of an alpine glacier descending the Cedar River valley from the upper elevations of the Cascade Mountains. Because upstream fish passage to Chester Morse Lake is naturally blocked by Cedar Falls, the fish populations in the lake are isolated from those downstream. Bull trout and pygmy whitefish populations in Chester Morse Lake have thus been separated from other populations for at least 13,000 years, and represent unique genetic stocks of these species. Both of these species spend most of their time in deeper portions of the lake. The surface of Chester Morse Lake has an average annual fluctuation of about 20 feet in elevation. Inundation of the Cedar and Rex river deltas strongly affects their aquatic and wetland habitats. Changes in lake level management toward higher lake levels in the past 15 years have resulted in a retreat upslope of sedge and willow communities on the delta. Inundation of the Cedar and Rex river channels within and upstream of the delta causes sedimentation that can negatively affect bull trout eggs. Studies are underway to examine these effects.  Smaller lakes  Smaller lakes in the Cedar River Watershed above Cedar Falls are all subalpine and occur in cirques, which are basins at the head of valleys carved by alpine glaciers. None of these lakes have fish populations but all support numerous amphibian populations, including Cascades frog, Pacific tree frog, and northwestern salamanders.  Findley Lake  Findley Lake and its watershed have been the site of extensive scientific research since its establishment as a study site under the International Biological Program in the early 1970s. Research has tapered off in recent years. Walsh Lake Walsh Lake, 68 acres in area, is the largest lake in the lower watershed. With 11 documented species, it has the greatest diversity of fish species of all lakes in the watershed. A population of kokanee (a landlocked form of sockeye salmon) lives in Walsh Lake and spawns in its major tributary, Webster Creek. Researchers at the University of Washington have claimed that Walsh Lake is among the least disturbed low elevation lakes in the Puget Sound region. 14 Lakes 14 Lakes are a set of five ponds ranging in size from 0.4 to 3.6 acres. (They are named for their location in Section 14 within the township/range system.) These lakes are located in depressions and are probably \\"kettle lakes\\" created during the retreat of large glaciers that once covered Puget Sound during the Pleistocene. Kettles are formed by large, stranded pieces of glacial ice that become buried by glacial outwash sediments and after melting, leave behind a depression. None of these lakes have perennial inflowing streams or outlets. The water levels of 14 Lakes fluctuate seasonally and inter-annually based on the amount of precipitation and rates of groundwater inflow and outflow. Because shrubs and trees can't persist with the periodic flooding, the fluctuating water levels maintain a very diverse herbaceous-dominated shoreline with most plant species adapted to periodic flooding. (See botanical inventory of 14 Lakes (pdf)) Due to the rarity of lake-pond habitat in the watershed and surrounding landscape, 14 Lakes are an important aquatic habitat in the region, particularly for amphibian populations. These ponds are an important refuge for amphibian populations in this area because 14 Lakes do not have fish or non-native bull frogs (which prey on amphibian eggs and larvae and can eliminate native amphibians from lakes and ponds).

Northup, a black man who was born free in New York state, details his being tricked to go to Washington, D.C., where he was kidnapped and sold into slavery in the Deep South. He was in bondage for 12 years in Louisiana before he was able to secretly get information to friends and family in New York, who in turn secured his release with the aid of the state. Northup's account provides extensive details on the slave markets in Washington, D.C. and New Orleans, and describes at length cotton and sugar cultivation and slave treatment on major plantations in Louisiana. The work was published eight years before the Civil War by Derby & Miller of Auburn, New York, soon after Harriet Beecher Stowe's best-selling novel about slavery, Uncle Tom's Cabin (1852), to which it lent factual support. Northup's book, dedicated to Stowe, sold 30,000 copies, making it a bestseller in its own right.Northup, Solomon. Twelve Years a Slave: Summary, online text at Documenting the American South, University of North Carolina, accessed 19 July 2012 After being published in several editions in the 19th century and later cited by specialist scholarly works on slavery in the United States, the memoir fell into public obscurity for nearly 100 years. It was re- discovered on separate occasions by two Louisiana historians, Sue Eakin (Louisiana State University at Alexandria) and Joseph Logsdon (University of New Orleans). In the early 1960s, they researched and retraced Solomon Northup's journey and co-edited a historically annotated version that was published by Louisiana State University Press (1968). The memoir has been adapted as two film versions, produced as the 1984 PBS television film Solomon Northup's Odyssey and the Oscar-winning 2013 film 12 Years a Slave. Synopsis In his home town of Saratoga, New York, Solomon Northup, a free negro who was a skilled carpenter and violinist, was approached by two circus promoters. They offered him a brief, high-paying job as a musician with their traveling circus. Without informing his wife, who was away at work in a nearby town, he traveled with the strangers to downstate New York and Washington, D.C. Soon after arriving in the capital, he awoke to find himself drugged, bound, and in the cell of a slave pen. When Northup asserted his rights as a free man, he was beaten and warned never again to mention his free life in New York. Transported by ship to New Orleans, Northup and other enslaved blacks contracted smallpox and one died. In transit, Northup implored a sympathetic sailor to send a letter to his family. The letter arrived safely, but, lacking knowledge of his final destination, Northup's family was unable to effect his rescue. Northup's first owner was William Prince Ford, who ran a lumber mill on a bayou of the Red River.Ford became a leader of the Restoration Movement in Louisiana as he and his Baptist congregation were influenced by the writings of Alexander Campbell. Northup subsequently had several other owners, less humane than Ford, during his twelve-year bondage. At times, his carpentry and other skills contributed to his being treated relatively well, but he also suffered extreme cruelty. On two occasions, he was attacked by John Tibeats, a white man he was leased to, and defended himself, for which he suffered severe reprisals. After about two years of enslavement, Northup was sold to Edwin Epps, a notoriously cruel cotton planter. Epps held Northup enslaved for 10 years, during which time he assigned the New Yorker to various roles from cotton picker, to hauler to driver, which required Northup to oversee the work of fellow slaves and punish them for undesirable behavior. While on Epps' plantation, Northup became friends with a slave girl named Patsey, whom he writes about briefly in the book. After being beaten for claiming his free status in Washington, D.C., Northup in the ensuing 12 years did not reveal his true history again to a single person, slave or owner. Finally he confided his story to Samuel Bass, a white carpenter and abolitionist from Canada working at the Epps plantation. Bass, at great risk to himself, sent letters to Northup's wife and friends in Saratoga. Parker, a white shopkeeper, received one of the letters and sought assistance from Henry B. Northup, a white attorney and politician whose family had held and freed Solomon Northup's father and with whom Solomon had a longtime friendship. Henry contacted New York state officials. As the state had passed a law in 1840 to provide financial resources for the rescue of citizens kidnapped into slavery, the Governor appointed Henry Northup as an agent to travel to Louisiana and work with law enforcement to free Solomon. Once in Louisiana, Henry Northup hired local Avoyelles Parish attorney, John P. Waddill, to assist in securing Solomon Northup's freedom. After a variety of bureaucratic measures and searches were undertaken, the attorney succeeded in locating Solomon and freeing him from the plantation. Northup later filed charges against the men who sold him into slavery but was unsuccessful in his suit. He returned to New York and reunited with his family there. Northup concludes his narrative with the following statement: Reception and historical value Questions were often raised about accuracy or authenticity of books about slavery, including slave narratives. Similarities between Northup's book and Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel Uncle Tom's Cabin have been noted by critics. Stowe's book was published a year before Northup's memoir but by the time she published her rebuttal to critics about accuracy in her A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin, she referred to his story, which had been publicized in newspaper accounts.

A Key to Uncle Tom's Cabin, Inkling Books, 2005 > (reprint), p.245 Northup's account confirms Stowe's fictional portrayal of conditions in Louisiana, as the area where Northup was enslaved was close to the fictional setting of Simon Legree's plantation on the Red River. Northup expresses other arguments against slavery. For instance, Uncle Tom's Cabin focuses on how the legal system prevents even kind owners from treating slaves well and how it releases cruel owners from liabilities for their treatment of slaves. Such themes appear in Northup's narrative, too. Writing about this work, Eric Herschtal noted that \\"Slave narratives were never intended to give an unbiased view. They were antislavery polemics meant to bring down the institution.\\" The fact that these works had a purpose was similar to other published works. Herschtal emphasizes that Northup expressed compassion in his account, quoting him: \\"It is not the fault of the slaveholder that he is cruel,\\" Northup writes, \\"so much as it is the fault of the system under which he lives.\\"Eric Herschtal, \\"The Passion of Solomon Northup\\" The New York Times Northup's first-person account of his twelve years of bondage captured attention in the national political debate over slavery that took place in the years leading up to the Civil War. It drew endorsements from major Northern newspapers, anti- slavery organizations, and evangelical groups. It \\"sold three times as many copies as Frederick Douglass's slave narrative in its first two years.\\" Northup's account describes the daily life of slaves at Bayou Boeuf in Louisiana, their diet and living conditions, the relationship between master and slave, and the means that slave catchers used to recapture runaways. His account shares some details similar to those of authors who were escaped slaves, such as Frederick Douglass, Harriet Jacobs, and William Wells Brown. However, Northup was unique in documenting his being kidnapped as a free man from the North and sold into slavery. His perspective was always to compare what he saw to what he knew before while living as a free man in a free state. While there were hundreds of such kidnappings, he was among the few persons who gained freedom again. Early and mid-twentieth century historians of slavery, Kenneth Stampp, Stanley Elkins, and Ulrich Bonnell Phillips, endorsed the historical accuracy of the book. Eakin and Logsdon in 1968, wrote: \\"In the last analysis, [the] narrative deserves to be believed, not simply because [Northup] seems to be talking reasonably, not merely because he adorns his tale with compelling and persuasive details. At every point where materials exist for checking his account, it can be verified.\\" These materials include trial records, correspondence, diary, and slave sale records. While Twelve Years a Slave is the best-known example of someone who was kidnapped and later freed ‚Äì albeit through extraordinary efforts ‚Äì historians have begun to research and present other cases. Most of the known court cases of freedom suits related to kidnapping victims were filed in New Orleans, although some were in border states such as Missouri. One such suit took place in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where Cornelius Sinclair, a free black man from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, had been sold after being kidnapped in August 1825 and transported South with some younger free blacks. A total of about 20 young blacks disappeared from the Philadelphia area that summer, some survivors sold into slavery in Mississippi.Judson E. Crump and Alfred L. Brophy, \\"Cornelius Sinclair's Odyssey: Freedom, Slavery, and Freedom Again in the Old South\\", Social Science Research Network, July 2014, UNC Legal Studies Research Paper No. 2469529, accessed 16 April 2015.John Henderson, Joseph Watson, Job Brown, Thomas Bradford Junr., R.

Somerville and Eric Ledell Smith, Notes and Documents: \\"Rescuing African American Kidnapping Victims in Philadelphia as Documented in the Joseph Watson Papers\\", Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography, Vol. 129 (2008), pp. 317, 330-332 Helped by the intervention of Philadelphia mayor Joseph Watson, most of those kidnapped were returned free to Philadelphia by June 1826, but Sinclair's odyssey was longer. He was freed in 1827 by a unanimous verdict of an all-white jury. =Reissue= After additional printings in the 19th century, the book went out of print until 1968, when historians Joseph Logsdon and Sue Eakin restored it to prominence. Eakin discovered the story as a child growing up in Louisiana plantation country‚Äîthe owner of a first edition showed her the book, after finding it in a former plantation home. Years later, Logsdon had a student from an old Louisiana family who brought a copy of the original 1853 book to class; her family had owned it for more than a century. Together Logsdon and Eakin studied Northup's account, documenting it through the slave sales records of Washington, D.C. and New Orleans, by retracing his journey and bondage in Bayou Boeuf plantation country in central Louisiana and through its records, and documenting his New York State origins. They found his father's freeman's decree, and the case files for the legal work that restored Northup's freedom and prosecuted his abductors. In 1968, Eakin and Logsdon's thoroughly annotated edition of the original book was published by Louisiana State University Press, shedding new light on Northup's account and establishing its historic significance. That book has been widely used by scholars and in classrooms for more than 40 years, and is still in print. In 1998, Logsdon was invited by scholars in upstate New York to participate in a search for Solomon's grave. However, bad weather prevented the search that year, and Logsdon died the following June 1999. In 2007, shortly before her death at age 90, Eakin completed an updated and expanded version of their book; it includes more than 150 pages of new background material, maps, and photographs. In 2013, e-book and audiobook versions of her final definitive edition were released in her honor. With permission, scholars may use Eakin's lifetime archives through The Sue Eakin Collection, Louisiana State University at Alexandria, Louisiana. The Joseph Logsdon Archives are available at the University of New Orleans. Historian Jesse Holland noted in a 2009 interview that he had relied on Northup's memoir and detailed description of Washington in 1841 to identify the location of some slave markets in the capital. Holland has also researched the roles of African-American slaves who, as skilled laborers, helped build some of the important public buildings in Washington, including the Capitol and part of the original Executive Mansion.

Marx (July 14, 1866 ‚Äì November 23, 1923) was an American political figure, who was mayor of Detroit from 1913 to 1918. Biography Marx was born on July 14, 1866, in Wayne County, Michigan, the son of German immigrants Stephen and Eleanor Busch Marx. Marx attended the Detroit public schools and the German-American Seminary, and spent much of his early life farming, but as Detroit and Hamtramck, Michigan grew, the encroaching cities swallowed the Marx farm. Marx's father Stephen sold the farm, giving him and his brothers several thousand dollars to start a business. Oscar Marx used this money to buy into a bankrupt optical firm, the Michigan Optical Company, in 1891, and steered the company to become one of the largest in the region. In addition to being president of the Michigan Optical Company, Marx was a member of the board of directors of the Standard Computing Scale Company and vice-president of the Robert Oakman Land Co. In 1897, Marx married Lydia Darmstaetter; the couple had two children: Lydia Marx and Oscar B. Marx Jr. Politics In 1894-95, Marx was the Detroit estimator-at-large. In 1895 he was elected as an alderman, a position he held for eight years. In 1904, Marx ran for City Treasurer, but was beaten. He served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1908 (and was again a delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1916). In 1910, he was appointed City Assessor, and two years later saw his first term as Detroit's mayor. Marx served three terms in all as mayor. Marx was friends with Robert Oakman and John Dodge, and the three men controlled the Republican Party in Southeast Michigan for much of the 1910s. Marx appointed James J. Couzens, the man who would become the next mayor, to take over the Detroit police force, and in February of his final year in office Marx created a committee to oversee the feasibility of construction the Outer Drive bypass in the city. Oscar Marx died on November 23, 1923.

He is the Pontifical Legate of the Western Europe and Representative of the Armenian Church to the Holy See. Formerly, he was the Primate of Diocese of Armenian Church of America (Eastern). Early life  Barsamian was born in Arapkir, Turkey on July 4, 1951. At age 13, he began his religious studies at the Holy Cross Armenian Seminary in Istanbul. Encouraged by Archbishop Shnork Kaloustian (the late Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople), he went to Jerusalem to study at the Seminary of the St. James Armenian Patriarchate from 1967 to 1971. He was ordained a celibate priest in 1971 and achieved the ecclesiastical degree of vartabed two years later. His later educational pursuits led him throughout the United States and Europe: to New York's General Theological Seminary, St. John's University in Minneapolis, the Gregorian University in Rome, and Oxford's Oriental Institute. He has lectured in the United States, Italy, England, Germany, Jerusalem and Armenia, and has conducted research at the Manuscript Library of Yerevan, the Mekhitarist Institute of Venice and the Manuscript Library at the Patriarchate of Jerusalem.

In 1992, he received the rank of archbishop. In May 2018, Barsamian announced that he would not seek an eighth term as Primate. His 28-year reign as Primate is the longest in the history of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America. On May 4, 2018, Very Rev. Fr. Daniel Findikyan (now a bishop) was elected as Barsamian's successor and confirmed by Karekin II, the Supreme Patriarch and Spiritual Leader of the Armenian Church. Other activities Abp. Barsamian has been a central figure in arranging frequent meetings between the supreme leaders of the Armenian and Catholic churches. He has played a key role in arranging the 2001 visit of Pope John Paul II to Armenia, in bringing together the mass in remembrance of Armenian genocide at St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica in Rome in 2015, and in organizing the visit of Pope Francis to Armenia in June 2016. As the former president of Fund for Armenian Relief (FAR), Barsamian led the effort to develop the Republic of Armenia and bring humanitarian assistance to its citizens. Abp. Barsamian is a leader in religious and ecumenical organizations, including the National Council of Churches, the World Council of Churches, the Appeal of Conscience Foundation, the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations, Religion in American Life, and the American Bible Society.

Gouania lupuloides is plentiful around the edges of clearings but appears only occasionally in the forest canopy. G. lupuloides flowers from November to March, usually in the early dry season; the plant does not often flower in March and rarely flowers in the rainy season. G. lupuloides can fruit as early as January, and as late as May with a peak in March and April.  Uses  In Jamaican patois a vine is called a wis (wythie). To clean one's teeth with this plant one cuts off a portion of the vine, peels off the bark and chews the tip. The tip becomes fibrous and frothy. Chewstick tastes slightly bitter but not unpleasant. The plant is used to make a commercial toothpaste. Chewstick may also be used as an ingredient in Jamaican ginger beer. References * MEDlCINAL PLANTS OF JAMAICA. PARTS 1 & 11\\\\. By G. F.

It consists of the Killaire area, Station Road area and Seymour area and falls under the control of Ards and North Down Borough Council and within the Bangor West electoral boundary. Carnalea is bordered by Belfast Lough to the North, Crawfordsburn to the immediate West, Wandsworth and Springhill/Rathmore to the immediate South, and Bryansburn to the East, which then leads into Bangor town centre. The area has seen relatively increased development in recent years, notably with the creation of Carnalea Glen, Station Court, and Killaire Court. The closure of the Carnalea Mini-Market after Christmas of 2005 has led to the site's redevelopment for residential use, such is the high demand for housing in the area. Station Road, off the Crawfordsburn Road, is the central area of Carnalea and leads to Carnalea railway station, Carnalea Golf Club, the North Down coastal path and a private road of modern dwellings in the grounds of a former manor. Recently, the Carnalea Residents Association, in conjunction with the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), implemented a Neighbourhood Watch scheme in order to maintain the high standards of living and social security that are synonymous with the general North Down area.  Places of interest  Carnalea Golf Club - An 18-hole course is situated on the coast with panoramic views of Belfast Lough and adjacent to the North Down coastal path. The clubhouse at Carnalea began renovation in March 2007. As well as a picturesque golf course, Carnalea Golf club also boasts a bar, restaurant, separate function room, and Snooker room. These facilities regularly entice the visit of professional footballer Keith Gillespie. North Down Coastal Path - Stretching from Bangor to Holywood and overlooking Belfast Lough, the coastal path is popular with ramblers, dog walkers, runners and cyclists (it is an official cycle path as of January 2010). Alternative access to the coastal path is via Kerr's Wood, a tree-lined pathway originating at the Crawfordsburn Road.  Travel  The Carnalea area is served by Carnalea railway station and two bus stops with both services provided by Translink. The railway station was refurbished by Translink, with the aid of the Carnalea Residents Association in the summer of 2005. Journey times by train to Belfast and Bangor are approximately forty minutes and five minutes respectively operated by Northern Ireland Railways.  Elderly issues  The population of Carnalea is predominantly elderly. Local nursing home Ailsa Lodge is situated in the Killaire area, whilst another care home bearing Carnalea's name, the Four Seasons Carnalea Nursing Home lies closer towards Bangor town centre in Bryansburn, outside the commonly accepted Carnalea border. Just beside the Seymour area is another cluster of elderly housing, a private area known as Worcester Avenue.  Religion  Carnalea falls within the Church of Ireland Diocese of Down and Dromore, which in Roman Catholic terms is the Diocese of Down and Connor. There are two local churches bearing the Carnalea title, but, much like the Four Seasons Carnalea Nursing Home, only one falls within what would be generally accepted as the Carnalea area. Saint Gall's Parish of Carnalea is an Anglican/Episcopalian place of worship, and is situated at the edge of Carnalea, on the Crawfordsburn Road, beside Bryansburn Rangers FC's Ballywooley Playing Fields. Its Summer F√™te and May Fair are particularly popular with local residents. Much further afield is Carnalea Methodist Church, which has undergone considerable redevelopment in the past year in order to modernise the church grounds. It is the home of the popular Carnalea Wado Kai Karate Club and Carnalea Methodist Youth Club. It lies in the Springhill (Bangor suburb) area of Bangor, commonly known as Rathmore.

Pe≈°iƒá's art  Nikola Pe≈°iƒá's art consists of highly esthetic objects which hide and generate at the same time different meanings by means of their simple pleasing forms and lines. The interpretation of Pe≈°iƒá's art is based on symbolic models of Christianity, gnosticism and non-Christian religions. According to Nikola, art must be attractive \\"at first sight\\". His sculptures are made of transparent and dim polyesters, epoxy and acrylic resins, magnifying glasses, mirrors, brass and other polished and reflecting materials. Even though Pesic tries to achieve perfection, he rarely uses machines when manufacturing his sculptures, and he usually does everything manually. As he himself says: \\"My sculptures should reflect my wish to make something perfect, and at the same time the impossibility to do it. I think that the manually shaped forms have special enchant and power.Miodrag Tadiƒá:Lice umetnosti:Intervju sa Nikolom Pe≈°iƒáem.Lice, Br.37;str.140-145 One of the characteristics of Pesiƒá's art is absolute absence of politics in his works. Pesiƒá, if looks some political idol at all, he looks for it in bogumils, cathars and gnostics, because like them, he does not have any need to belong to any state, political option or church.

The memorandum requested a \\"guarantee of the ultimate independence of Arabia\\". The Declaration stated the British policy that the future government of the regions of the Ottoman Empire occupied by Allies of World War I \\"should be based upon the principle of the consent of the governed\\". Significance of the Declaration The Declaration to the Seven is notable as the first British pronouncement to the Arabs advancing the principle of national self- determination. Although the British sought to secure their position by adopting the Wilsonian doctrine of Woodrow Wilson, neither Britain nor France was prepared to implement their promises to the Arabs nor to abdicate the position won by victory over the Ottoman Empire. The document was not widely publicised, the Declaration may explain the action of General Edmund Allenby, who ordered a halt to the advance after the rout of Turkish forces outside Damascus and allowed the city to be captured by Arab forces in September 1918 after the Battle of Megiddo and acting on instructions from London, thus bolstering the Arab claim to the independence of Syria whilst simultaneously undermining the French claims to the territory under the terms of the Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement.

He was the first piano-accordionist to appear on big- time vaudeville, records, radio and the screen. he usually performed under the stage-name \\"Deiro\\". Guido and his younger brother Pietro Deiro (known as \\"Pietro\\") were among the highest-paid musicians on the vaudeville circuit, and they both did much to introduce and popularize the piano accordion in the early 20th century. Early life Born Guido Pietro Deiro in the village of Salto Canavese, in the fraction of Deiro, near Turin, Italy. He was born into a family of rural Italian nobility that were involved in raising dairy cattle, growing wine grapes, tending orchards, and operating general stores to sell their produce. While a young boy, Guido entertained himself by playing the ocarina, an ancient flute-like wind instrument usually made from ceramic or wood. His uncle Fred noticed Guido‚Äôs unusual musical ability on the ocarina, and decided to get him a more sophisticated instrument, a diatonic button accordion. Guido started to play the accordion when nine years old. His father allowed Guido to play this two-row accordion in the street outside his stores because Guido‚Äôs playing would draw a crowd and attract potential customers. Deiro became a student of the famous Italian accordionist-composer Giovanni Gagliardi. Career Deiro left his home to avoid an arranged marriage, and defying his father's wishes that he manage the family businesses, he became a professional entertainer and took engagements in France and Germany playing the chromatic accordion. His success as a performer led the Ronco-Vercelli accordion company in Italy to ask him to demonstrate their new piano- accordions at the Alaska‚ÄìYukon‚ÄìPacific Exposition in 1908. This world's fair was held in Seattle from June to October 1909. After the fair, he stayed on in Seattle working as a musician in saloons. By this time, he had become a virtuoso at playing a piano accordion. In 1910 he was discovered by an agent for the Orpheum Vaudeville Circuit. His opening debut was at the American Theatre in San Francisco (managed by Sid Grauman) on June 15, 1910. He became an immediate sensation, and began traveling the vaudeville circuit routinely back and forth across the United States and Canada (and other countries as well) as a headliner. During his travels, he met and became friends with another famous Italian accordionist: Pietro Frosini. In addition to playing the popular hits of the day and light classical and operatic fare, Deiro composed his own original compositions. In 1911, Deiro wrote the hit song \\"Kismet\\" which became the theme song of a successful Broadway musical (1911) and was also featured in two Hollywood movies (1921, 1930). During his lifetime, he recorded more than 110 songs (primarily for Columbia Records, and occasionally for Edison phonograph cylinders). The records were enormously popular, and, along with his vaudeville stardom, helped to propel Deiro to the status of a minor celebrity in American culture.Peter C. Muir, \\"Looks Like a Cash Register and Sounds Worse: The Deiro Brothers and the Rise of the Piano Accordion in American Culture 1908‚Äì1930\\" (Free-Reed Journal, vol. 3, 2001, p. 55) Throughout the teens and well into the 1920s, Deiro was a dominant voice of accordion. As Deiro showcased the piano accordion through his vaudeville performances across the United States, more and more people were introduced to the instrument, the popularity of the accordion increased. In 1928, Deiro was featured in an early sound film, Vitaphone #2968, titled GUIDO DEIRO: The World's Foremost Piano-Accordionist. He appeared as an accordionist in several other motion pictures, such as the musical Shine on Harvest Moon and the Carole Lombard comedy The Other Man. Marriages Deiro's son Guido claims in his book Mae West and the Count that Deiro married West in 1914, Guido Roberto Deiro, \\"Guido Deiro & Mae West: The Untold Story,\\" Guido Deiro: Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 2 (Archeophone 5014: 2009), pp. 12-13. yet it was not made public as she was married to fellow vaudevillian Frank Szatkus. West and Deiro traveled together, appearing all over the country, before their alleged divorce in 1920. ENVELOPE 7. Misc. Letters & Legal Documents, \\"The Guido Deiro Archive: Part II. Printed Items,\\" Center for the Study of Free-Reed Instruments at the City University of New York Graduate Center According to the American Masters documentary \\"Mae West: Dirty Blonde\\", West aborted Deiro's child on the advice of her mother; the procedure nearly killed her, and left her barren. Deiro was devastated when he learned what she did, and ended the relationship. \\"Mae West: Dirty Blonde\\" American Masters (requires PBS Passport membership to view) Deiro's other marriages were to Julia Tatro (1913), Ruby Lang (1920-1927?), and Yvonne Teresa Le Baron de Forrest (1937‚Äì1941). Final years Deiro continued to play vaudeville shows until at least 1935 and performed on two world tours, although after 1929, he traveled less and focused his career on the west coast of the United States. During the 1930s, he opened a number of accordion studios and taught and sold accordions. He also gave musical coaching to a young virtuoso accordionist-entertainer from Fresno, California: Dick Contino. After World War II, he lost most of his studios. He became ill in 1947, and died of congestive heart failure in 1950 at age 63. Legacy Although Deiro's substantial musical contributions were forgotten in no small part due to his brother's promotional claims and the passage of time, beginning in 2001 there has been a revival of interest in the music of Guido Deiro, primarily due to the efforts of his son, Count Guido Roberto Deiro, and his collaboration with American concert accordionist, historian and author Henry Doktorski. The two have worked together to (1) create a website dedicated to Deiro which went online in 2001, (2) record the complete works of Deiro: Vaudeville Accordion Classics, Bridge Records 9138 A/B (2003), (3) release The Complete Recorded Works of Guido Deiro, Vols. 1, 2, 3 and 4, Archeophone Records 5012, 5014, 5018 and 5019) (2007-2010), and (4) edit and publish The Complete Works of Guido Deiro Printed Music Anthology, Mel Bay Publications (2008). (See external links below.) In addition, Doktorski has written a biography of the two Deiro brothers: The Brothers Deiro and Their Accordions (The Classical Free-Reed, Inc., Oakdale, Pennsylvania: 2005). In 2001 Deiro's son donated the Guido Deiro Archives to The Center for the Study of Free-Reed Instruments at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

He died in 1974 at the age of 69. During the course of his life, he married once and fathered seven children. He created one of the first artificial fishing lures in 1936, which later became known as the Original Floater, a lure for which he would be made somewhat noted.  Early life  Born in Sysm√§, Finland, Lauri Rapala shared his home with evergreen forests and hundreds of lakes. At the age of seven, his mother Mari and he moved to the parish of Asikkala, around from the capital Helsinki. The clergymen at the parish could not remember Mari's surname, Saarinen, and so he simply put it as Rapala, the village in Sysm√§ municipality from which they had moved. 'Rapa' is one of the Finnish words for \\"mud.\\" Finnish children of this time were generally put to work as soon as they became capable, and Rapala did the same. Rapala met Elma Lepp√§nen when he was in his early twenties, and they married in 1928. They lived in her parents' house in Riihilahti until 1933. Europe's economy was in a downturn during this period, and it worsened as the effects of the Great Depression in America arrived in Europe. He worked as a lumberjack during the winter, and farmer's hand or commercial fisherman in summer. Lauri and Elma had seven children; five sons (Reino, Risto, Ensio, Esko, and Kauko) and two daughters (Marja and Irja).  Early fishing work  rowing boat, or 'soutuvene', in Utaj√§rvi, Finland. For fishing, he netted whitefish and set long lines for perch and pike. Three trout weighing earned the equivalent of two weeks pay in a factory nearby; so Rapala would also troll a line with a baited hook to catch trout. He trolled about a thousand hooks on a trotline behind his traditional Finnish fishing rowing boat, known in Finnish as a 'soutuvene'. He baited all the hooks himself, and since he had no motor for his boat, he rowed approximately every day, except in storms. According to the recollection of his son Risto, Lauri Rapala fished for trout with a homemade fishing rod. When a fish hit, he would throw his pole in the water, and row behind it, to tire the fish. With so much time on the water, Rapala had much time to think, to observe, and to learn how the fish behaved, how the minnows swam, and how the injured minnows were more likely to be eaten by the larger fish. \\"Our father really understood fishing,\\" says Risto. \\"He recognized the relationship between bottom structure and where fish are located. He learned how fish fed, and how they moved from one location to another. And Rapala understood the effects of weather on fishing.\\"  Designing the original lure  Rapala thought that an artificial lure could bring in more fish, and therefore more money, in addition to eliminating time needed to bait hooks. After a lot of trial and error, and with the help of a hermit-fisherman, Toivo Pylv√§l√§inen, who lived on an island of Lake P√§ij√§nne, and Rapala's friend Akseli Soram√§ki, he created a lure with the right wobble to imitate an injured bait fish. It was made of cork, with tinfoil around it and melted photograph negatives as a coating instead of lacquer, which Rapala could not afford. When completed, he tied a string to his thumb, and trolled it behind his boat. Pike and perch attacked it voraciously, and his sons, who were young at the time, claim he would often bring in a day. This is the lure that would become the Original Floater, the most well-known fishing lure in the world.  Rising popularity and improving production  When the World War II broke out in Europe in 1939, shortages arose, and Rapala began making his lures from tree bark. During the war, his lure achieved some promotion. Dynamite was sometimes used to obtain fish, but Rapala said his lure would produce more fish. He and his friends had a contest, and he outfished what had been \\"caught\\" with dynamite, catching 78 fish in a few hours. After the war, demand for his lures increased, so he enlisted the help of his sons, teaching them the art of making the lures. Ensio did so well on one that he achieved a national craftsmanship award for it. Elma handled bookkeeping, and wrote and designed promotional copy for the lure boxes. They developed machines to improve efficiency and quality of the lures, to have them sanded and polished, and to make identical lure bodies. To make sure all the lures ran just right, Rapala insisted that all lures be tank tested, and viewed by him for final approval.

FLT3 is a cytokine receptor which belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase class III. CD135 is the receptor for the cytokine Flt3 ligand (FLT3L). It is expressed on the surface of many hematopoietic progenitor cells. Signalling of FLT3 is important for the normal development of haematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells. The FLT3 gene is one of the most frequently mutated genes in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). High levels of wild-type FLT3 have been reported for blast cells of some AML patients without FLT3 mutations. These high levels may be associated with worse prognosis.  Structure  FLT3 is composed of five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains, an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, a juxtamembrane domain and a tyrosine-kinase domain consisting of 2 lobes that are connected by a tyrosine-kinase insert. Cytoplasmic FLT3 undergoes glycosylation, which promotes localization of the receptor to the membrane.  Function  CD135 is a Class III receptor tyrosine kinase. When this receptor binds to FLT3L a ternary complex is formed in which two FLT3 molecules are bridged by one (homodimeric) FLT3L. The formation of such complex brings the two intracellular domains in close proximity to each other, eliciting initial trans-phosphorylation of each kinase domain. This initial phosphorylation event further activates the intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, which in turn phosphorylates and activates signal transduction molecules that propagate the signal in the cell. Signaling through CD135 plays a role in cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. CD135 is important for lymphocyte (B cell and T cell) development. Two cytokines that down modulate FLT3 activity (& block FLT3-induced hematopoietic activity) are: * TNF-Alpha (Tumor necrosis factor- alpha) * TGF-Beta (Transforming growth factor-beta) TGF-Beta especially, decreases FLT3 protein levels and reverses the FLT3L-induced decrease in the time that hematopoietic progenitors spend in the G1-phase of the cell cycle.  Clinical significance  = Cell surface marker = Cluster of differentiation (CD) molecules are markers on the cell surface, as recognized by specific sets of antibodies, used to identify the cell type, stage of differentiation and activity of a cell. CD135 is an important cell surface marker used to identify certain types of hematopoietic (blood) progenitors in the bone marrow. Specifically, multipotent progenitors (MPP) and common lymphoid progenitors (CLP) express high surface levels of CD135. This marker is therefore used to differentiate hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), which are CD135 negative, from MPPs, which are CD135 positive. (See Lymphopoiesis#Labeling lymphopoiesis) = Role in cancer = CD135 is a proto- oncogene, meaning that mutations of this protein can lead to cancer. Mutations of the FLT3 receptor can lead to the development of leukemia, a cancer of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitors. Internal tandem duplications of FLT3 (FLT3-ITD) are the most common mutations associated with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and are a prognostic indicator associated with adverse disease outcome. = FLT3 inhibitors = Gilteritinib, a dual FLT3-AXL tyrosine kinase inhibitor has completed a phase 3 trial of relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia in patients with FLT3 ITD or TKD mutations. In 2017, gilteritinib gained FDA orphan drug status for AML. In November 2018, the FDA approved gilteritinib for treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with a FLT3 mutation as detected by an FDA-approved test. Quizartinib (AC220) was tested inn a phase II clinical trial for AML patients with FLT3 mutations. for refractory AML ‚Äì particularly in patients who went on to have a stem cell transplant. Midostaurin was approved by the FDA in April 2017 for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed AML who are positive for oncogenic FLT3, in combination with chemotherapy. The drug is approved for use with a companion diagnostic, the LeukoStrat CDx FLT3 Mutation Assay, which is used to detect the FLT3 mutation in patients with AML. Sorafenib has been reported to show significant activity against Flt3-ITD positive acute myelogenous leukemia. Sunitinib also inhibits Flt3. Lestaurtinib is in clinical trials. A paper published in Nature in April 2012 studied patients who developed resistance to FLT3 inhibitors, finding specific DNA sites contributing to that resistance and highlighting opportunities for future development of inhibitors that could take into account the resistance- conferring mutations for a more potent treatment.

Valerio Zurlini‚Äôs Autumn Tales. The Village Voice, August 22, 2000. He filmed short documentaries in the immediate post-war period and in 1954 directed his first feature film, The Girls of San Frediano, his only comedy.Biography of Valerio Zurlini In 1958 together with Leonardo Benvenuti, Piero De Bernardi and Alberto Lattuada Zurlini won the Silver Ribbon for Best Script for Lattuada's Guendalina. Zurlini made his name as a director with his second feature film, Violent Summer (1959), starring Eleonora Rossi Drago and Jean Louis Trintignant. In 1961 Zurlini filmed Girl with a Suitcase, a successful intimist drama, starring Claudia Cardinale, who became a film star in Italy, and Jacques Perrin, who would become Zurlini's favorite actor. In 1962 Zurlini's film Family Diary earned him the Golden Lion at the Venice Film Festival (it tied with Tarkovsky's Ivan's Childhood). Zurlini had a masterful skill for screen adaptations.Rolando Caputo. Literary cineastes: the Italian novel and the cinema. In: Peter E. Bondanella & Andrea Ciccarelli (eds.). The Cambridge Companion to the Italian Novel. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003. p.182-196 Both The Girls of San Frediano and Family Diary were based on Vasco Pratolini's work. Zurlini admired the work of Italian novelist Giorgio Bassani and hoped to adapt his novel The Garden of the Finzi-Continis, which was subsequently directed by Vittorio De Sica in 1971 (see The Garden of the Finzi-Continis (film)). His 1965 film The Camp Followers was entered into the 4th Moscow International Film Festival where it won the Special Silver Prize. Zurlini's last film, The Desert of the Tartars (1976), produced by Jacques Perrin and featuring an all-star ensemble, was based on Dino Buzzati's novel of the same name. In 1977 he was a member of the jury at the 10th Moscow International Film Festival. In the same year, with this film Zurlini, he won both the David di Donatello for Best Director and the Silver Ribbon for Best Director. The visual style of Zurlini's adaptations was informed by Giorgio de Chirico, Giorgio Morandi and Ottone Rosai's paintings. During the last years of his life Zurlini taught at the Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia in Rome. He died in Verona on 26 October 1982.Peter Lennon. Leave it to Diva. The Guardian, May 9, 2003. After Zurlini's death his work fell into relative obscurity, but regained popularity in the 2000s. In the early 2000s several Zurlini retrospectives were met with success internationally.

Development Shorthand was only introduced in Norway when it became necessary to record the proceedings of the Norwegian parliament (Stortinget) in a more reliable and official manner from the middle of the 19th century onwards. In 1857, 14 shorthand writers were finally hired following an 1845 command by King Oscar I. In the beginning an old Swedish system was used (G√∂trek's; a geometrical system), but once the news of Gabelsberger's system reached Norway in 1865 a switch was inevitable. Gabelsberger's system remained the dominant system of shorthand in Norway for a hundred years. However, because of the increasing demand for and popularity of shorthand from the 1930s onwards, a need for a simpler system arose. This demand was met primarily by Leif Wang and Olav Krogdahl, who were teachers of shorthand. They simplified Gabelsberger's system, using the German unified system (Einheitskurzschrift) and others as guidelines. Their first book was published in 1936, but it only caught on gradually. Today, however, it is the only system used by the reporters in the Norwegian parliament. No shorthand machines have been made for the Norwegian language; all proceedings are reported by hand. From 2009 the parliament will no longer train shorthand writers; proceedings will (gradually) be recorded electronically in the future. Due to the use of dictaphones and computers, shorthand is not in use in Norway other than in the parliament.

It was admitted to the Association of College Honor Societies (ACHS) in 1965. Lambda Iota Tau was founded at Michigan State University on December 3, 1953, and was incorporated in 1954 by representatives of chapters at Aquinas College, Baldwin Wallace University, Eastern Michigan University, Marygrove College, Mercy College of Detroit, Purdue University, Sioux Falls College, and the University of Detroit. The society has forty-six active chapters with a total membership of approximately 40,000. The society is a nonprofit organization. Elected officers of Lambda Iota Tau are the international executive secretary, the international assistant executive secretary, the treasurer, and the international board of chapter advisers. The international executive secretary conducts the affairs of the society, arranges for and presides over all international meetings, and consults with the international board in all actions affecting the society as a whole. The treasurer receives all dues and pays all financial obligations of the society. The international board of chapter advisers consists of five chapter advisers from five geographical areas. The board elects its own president, determines and initiates new policies within the constitutional limitations of the society, ratifies the appointments of the secretaries and treasurer, nominates candidates for all elective offices, corresponds with the chapters in their geographical areas, and determines the international dues. Members are students majoring or minoring in literature, including literature written in foreign languages, who are in the upper 35 percent of their class in cumulative grade point average, have attained at least a full B average in at least twelve semester credit hours or eighteen term hours of literature and all prerequisites thereto, are enrolled in at least their fifth college semester or seventh college term, and have presented an initiation paper. The initiation paper is presented in such a manner as the local chapter requires, is of a quality certified by the chapter adviser, and is on a literary topic (research or critical) or of a creative nature (short story, essay, poem, drama). Graduate students must have completed one semester term with an A-average. Members are initiated into local chapters established and maintained only at colleges or universities that grant the baccalaureate or higher degrees and that are accredited by the appropriate regional agency and certain appropriate professional accrediting agencies. The local chapters are approved by the administrations of their institutions. Lambda Iota Tau publishes its annual journal LIT, which includes noteworthy poems, short stories, essays, and critical analyses written by its members. The best piece in each category of LIT is awarded a publication prize. The society also publishes a semiannual Newsletter. In addition, several scholarships are awarded to the membership each year. Chapters are encouraged to hold regular meetings and to sponsor events and activities that will bring the study of literature to the attention of the campus at large. Chapters sponsor such projects as the appearance of outstanding speakers on their campuses, motion pictures based on works of literature, publications of student creative and critical writing, and library exhibits. They also hold book sales to foster more reading of literature. Some chapters volunteer for local Habitat for Humanity projects and various local literacy projects. The international office has in the past sponsored lectures by famous individuals such as John Crowe Ransom, Robert Lowell, and Richard Eberhart. The society currently confers honorary memberships on individuals who have made worthy contributions to some area of literature, language, or linguistics, or who have demonstrated proficiency in teaching, scholarship, criticism, or creative writing. The society also bestows an honorary presidency on a literary figure who has achieved distinction in both critical and creative writing. Honorary presidents have included W. H. Auden, Archibald MacLeish, Daniel Hoffman, Robert Penn Warren, Richard Eberhart, Richard Marius, and Robert Pinsky.

Starting in the 1960s at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory, then located in Washington, D.C., Bryan worked with a series of colleagues to develop numerical schemes for solving the equations of motion describing flow on a sphere. His work on these schemes led to the so-called \\"Bryan-Cox code\\" with which many early simulations were made, and which led to the Modular Ocean Model currently used by many numerical oceanographers and climate scientists. In addition to his important contributions in developing numerical codes, Bryan was also involved in early efforts to apply them to understanding the global climate system. In 1967, he published, with Michael Cox, the first model of the 3-dimensional circulation of the ocean, forced by both winds and thermodynamic forcing. In 1969, a paper with Syukoro Manabe was the first to present integrations of a fully coupled atmosphere-ocean model, demonstrating the importance of ocean heat transport to the climate. This work was recently named one of the top ten breakthroughs in the history of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration. Bryan's 1971 paper with the noted dynamicist Adrian Gill demonstrated the important role played by bottom topography in setting the structure of the global ocean circulation, and played a major role in suggesting links between changes in continental topography and climate, continuing a long-term interest in the role of oceanic heat transport in determining global climate.

The team went on to win the Copa Libertadores in 1966, with Cort√©s scoring a decisive goal against arch-rivals Nacional in the semifinal playoff on April 23, 1966, which allowed the team to reach the final where they defeated Argentine's River Plate after three matches, obtaining their third Copa Libertadores. Later that year, Cort√©s helped Pe√±arol to defeat Spanish champions Real Madrid to win the Intercontinental Cup title.

Uruguay was eliminated in quarterfinals by West Germany. Four years later in Mexico, he played all of Uruguay's six matches, as the team reached semifinals, where they lost to Brazil. With the consolation match against West Germany, Cort√©s reached an overall total of 11 World Cup matches played, Uruguay's second-highest mark behind goalkeeper and Pe√±arol teammate Ladislao Mazurkiewicz's 13. The match against the Germans was also his last international match. Coaching career After having played in Costa Rica in the late 1970s, Cort√©s became a coach, and has spent since almost three decades managing several clubs in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and El Salvador. In 1983, Cort√©s led Deportivo Suchitep√©quez to their only national title to date.

Dispute with the Guatemalan Federation After being removed from the charge of national coach in April 2003, Cort√©s sued the Guatemalan football federation (FEDEFUT) for breach of contract, demanding payment of part of his remuneration as national team coach. The coach took the case before FIFA, whom in 2006 ruled that the FEDEFUT pay him part of what he demanded. In September 2006, the FEDEFUT reacted against the coach, accusing him of fraud before a local court, whom dictated that Cort√©s ‚Äì who was at the time living in Costa Rica and was at the moment in Guatemala ‚Äì remained in the country.

This arguably is Ai's most daring single, seeing as all of the song's lyrics were sexually suggestive, or sexual innuendos as in \\"Tsukune\\".

It was directed by Cheng Bugao and was adapted by Cai Chusheng and Xia Yan from the novella of the same name by Chinese author Mao Dun. The film stars Xiao Ying, Yan Yuexian, Gong Jianong, Gao Qianping and Ai Xia and was produced by the Mingxing Film Company. Today the film is considered one of the earliest films of the leftist movement in 1930s Shanghai.  Plot  The film tells the story of a family of poor silk farmers in Zhejiang province, who suffer hardship and deprivation when their crop of silkworm cocoons die off. The film criticizes not only the harsh market conditions that have forced the family into poverty, but the family's own superstitions and selfishness. Old Tong Bao is the patriarch of a silkworm-rearing family in Zhejiang. He refuses to buy foreign breeds of silkworms for his coming crop. The market conditions are harsh and despite the efforts his family put in rearing the silkworms, the ensuing cocoons are unable to fetch a price in the market. The film also features a subplot where a married woman, Lotus, is ostracized by Tong Bao's family for being a supposed jinx.

All of the species are known only from their teeth. The term \\"edestid\\" is often used to refer to any or all members of the order Eugeneodontiformes, though, strictly speaking, \\"edestid\\" properly refers only to members of the family Edestidae. Edestus is a Greek name derived from the word edeste (to devour), in reference to the aberrant quality and size of the species' teeth. A Source-book of Biological Names and Terms, Edward Jaeger (1944) The largest species, E. giganteus, could reach 6 m (20 ft) in length, the size of a modern great white shark. Like its other relatives, such as Helicoprion, and unlike modern sharks, the species of Edestus grew teeth in curved brackets, and did not shed the teeth as they became worn. In Edestus' case, only a single row of teeth occurred in each jaw, so the mouth would have resembled a monstrous pair of pinking shears. The degree of curvature in the teeth brackets, along with size, are distinct in each species. Because the teeth are sharp and serrated, all of the species are presumed to have been carnivorous. How they captured, or even ate, their prey, along with their appearance, remains pure speculation until a more complete fossil, or skull, is found. One such theory as to how Edestus might have hunted and killed its prey was found by Wayne M. Itano of the Natural History Museum of the University of Colorado et al. Itano examined specimens of Edestus minor from the Late Carboniferous deposits of Texas and discovered wear patterns that suggest that Edestus might have hunted by using its bizarre array of teeth to vertically thrash its prey, creating slashing wounds, thus incapacitating and then swallowing its prey. Such a method of predation would prove unique and as-yet-unknown elsewhere in the animal kingdom if correct. Examination of the wear marks of the specimens in Itano's study also suggest that Edestus might have preyed on tough-skinned animals, though what kind remains unknown. Species *Edestus giganteus, (also known as the \\"scissor-tooth shark\\") lived in the oceans during the Late Carboniferous (306-299 million years ago). Little is known about E. giganteus apart from a single set of teeth currently housed in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. Paleontological studies suggest that E. giganteus, unlike modern-day sharks, did not shed worn or broken teeth. Rather, it continued growing new teeth and gums near the back of the mouth, eventually pushing the older teeth and gums forward, until they protruded from the mouth. What function the strange teeth performed is not clear. E. giganteus is estimated to have grown to about the size of the modern-day great white shark, thus probably making it one of the top sea predators of its day. As with all other members of the genus, how E. giganteus could catch or eat its prey is unclear, though research of E. minor published in 2015 by Wayne M. Itano suggests that E. giganteus might have hunted and killed its prey by vertical thrashing attacks to slash and cripple prey. *E. heinrichi''' *E. mirus''' *E. minor''' *E. vorax''' References * Elasmo Research Category:Edestidae Category:Prehistoric cartilaginous fish genera Category:Carboniferous cartilaginous fish Category:Pennsylvanian fish of North America Category:Carboniferous fish of Europe ","title":"Edestus"},{"id":"10540953","text":"Skeffington family coat-of-arms Sir William Charles Farrell-Skeffington, 1st Baronet, (24 June 1742 ‚Äì 26 January 1815) was a British soldier.

Directed by Alan Gibson, it was based on the novel Ask Agamemnon by Jenni Hall. The film concerns a pair of unusually close fraternal twins, Jacki and Julian, discovering Swinging London while home on Spring Break. Their experiences complicate the pair's relationship, which is already strained due to Julian's incestuous fascination with his sister, which he sees as a natural manifestation of what he believes to be the pair's hive-minded nature. The film was produced at a time when conservative groups were beginning to react to the perceived social excesses of 1960s British culture. Coincidentally, it was released concurrently with Freddie Francis' Mumsy, Nanny, Sonny and Girly, another horror film which also dealt with an unusual familial relationship and contained a scene implying consensual brother-sister incest. Gemini and Girly were targeted by the conservative press as endemic of everything wrong with contemporary British culture, resulting in protests and theaters refusing to show the films. Plot Jacki (Geeson) and Julian (Potter) Dewar, a pair of fraternal twins, arrive via bus in London on Spring break from university, while their father is in Mexico on business. The pair launch themselves into London's underground party scene, clubbing at strip bars, accompanied by Jacki's teddy bear, Agamemnon, whom the twins address‚Äîand regard‚Äîas a father figure. At one club the pair encounter Clive, a small-time pimp who survives by ingratiating himself with the wealthy and well-connected. Clive quickly endears himself to Jacki, while Clive's sometimes girlfriend Denise attempts to seduce Jules. Julian turns her down, intent on beginning an incestuous relationship with Jacki. Julian regards he and his sister as two halves of a hive mind, and sees incest as a natural expression of their closeness. It becomes apparent that Clive is using Jacki and Jules' house to hide from a gangster to whom he owes a large gambling debt. One night after Jacki turns down Jules' advances, Clive plies him with whiskey and marijuana and takes him to a brothel where Clive keeps his \\"Circus\\"‚Äîa group of transvestite prostitutes who work for him. On Clive's orders, two of the prostitutes anally rape Julian while Clive takes photos. Clive attempts to blackmail Julian with the photos in order to pay off his gambling debt. Meanwhile, Denise reveals the plan to Jacki, telling her that Clive has similarly raped and blackmailed other men in the past, going to far as to sell some of them into sexual slavery when they were unable to pay him. That night, Jacki comforts Julian, telling him that she knows what happened and that their relationship has not changed. The next night, the twins bet a drunken Clive that he can't tell the two of them apart. Clive agrees, and the twins quickly dress the room in a ritualistic manner, erecting an \\"altar\\" for Agamemnon and dressing themselves in bed sheets altered to look like ceremonial robes. When Clive hesitates in identifying them properly, the twins stab him to death with Jacki's antique Tant≈çs. In the process of Clive's murder, Agamemnon is cut in half; upon seeing the bear, Jacki suffers a nervous breakdown and she flees, leaving Julian behind. Jacki is discovered semi-catatonic on a dock by member of parliament James Harrington-Smith, who recognizes her from a party. Jackie, now suffering amnesia, slowly recovers at James' flat as she attempts to piece together what happened the night of Clive's death. Her discovery of Clive's body upon returning home inadvertently causes a citywide manhunt for both siblings; James lies to the police about Jacki's whereabouts the night of the murder, allowing blame to be shifted solely onto Julian. Deducing that Julian has gone to hide in the same hotel where Clive kept his Circus, Jacki tells James that she'll convince him to turn himself in and to call the police if she hasn't returned after an hour. Jacki confronts Julian, whose mental state is rapidly deteriorating. Julian insists that all of their problems are a result of the pair not engaging in an incestuous relationship, which Julian believes would reinforce their \\"specialness\\" to the world. Meanwhile, James, fearful of the potential political scandal that could result from his connection to the twins, decides not to call the police. Jacki attempts to convince Julian that she'll help him escape London, intending to return to James with information on Julian's whereabouts. An increasingly paranoid and delusional Julian attacks Jacki and crushes her windpipe, killing her. In a moment of lucidity, a distraught Jules apologizes to the dead Jacki before blowing out the room's pilot light and gassing himself to death. Cast Production The film was shot on location in London, including a scene at the Royal Vauxhall Tavern, providing, per producer Peter Snell and star Judy Geeson in an audio commentary recorded in 2009, a snapshot of the London club scene as it existed at the time. At the time of filming, Geeson was at the height of her career following her role in To Sir With Love (1967) with Sidney Poitier; Sir Michael Redgrave, conversely, was near the end of his career. Recently diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, Redgrave would make only four more screen appearances. The film makes significant divergences from the book, which was highly experimental in nature and involved the use of dream and fantasy sequences written in the style of a Greek tragedy, during which Agamemnon comes to life and interacts with Jacki. Most notably, the film presents the story in chronological order, whereas the book takes place within the frame narrative of an amnesiac Jacki slowly piecing together the events leading up to Clive's death as she convalesces at James' house. The film also places added emphasis on the incestuous undercurrent between Jacki and Julian's relationship, while the book focuses more on Jacki's budding relationship with James and her conflicted feelings about Clive. At the climax, James phones the police, resulting in a strike team laying siege to Julian's hotel room and arresting him before he can harm Jacki. The story ends with Jacki breaking from a fantasy encounter with a wounded but recovering Agamemnon to find James checking in on her. Soundtrack The film soundtrack, with music and songs by Christopher Gunning, is a particularly fine period piece with wistfully autumnal instrumentals, mod party background music and quirky but melancholic songs by the likes of The Peddlers, Jackie Lee and Peter Lee Stirling (aka Daniel Boone).

From its source of Mount Murat in K√ºtahya Province, it flows generally west for to the Gediz River Delta in the Gulf of ƒ∞zmir. Name The ancient Greek name of the river was Hermos (·ºùœÅŒºŒøœÇ), Latinized as Hermus. The name of the river Gediz may be related to the Lydian proper name Cadys; Gediz is also the name of a town near the river's sources.The association with the nearly fully historical 8th century BC Lydian Cadys is made primarily in a number of Turkish sources The name \\"Gediz\\" may also be encountered as a male given name in Turkey. Ancient geography The Hermos separated Aeolia from Ionia, except for Ionic Phocaea, which was north of the Hermos. The valley of the Hermos was the heartland of the ancient Lydian Empire and overlooking the valley was the Lydian capital Sardis. Location In Turkey's Aegean Region, Gediz River's length is second only to B√ºy√ºk Menderes River whose flow is roughly parallel at a distance of slightly more than a hundred kilometers to the south. Gediz River rises from Murat Mountain and ≈ûaphane Mountain in K√ºtahya Province and flows through U≈üak, Manisa and ƒ∞zmir Provinces. It joins the sea in the northern section of the Gulf of ƒ∞zmir, close to the gulf's mouth, near the village of Yenibaƒüarasƒ± in Fo√ßa district, south of the center of the district. The Gediz Basin lies between northern latitudes of 38004‚Äô‚Äì39013‚Äô and southern longitudes of 26042‚Äô‚Äì29045‚Äô. It covers 2.2% of the total area of Turkey. Larger part of the alluvial plain called under the same name as the river (Gediz Plain) is within the area of Manisa Province and a smaller downstream section within ƒ∞zmir Province. Environmental issues The Gediz Delta is important as a nature reserve and is home to rare bird species. However, the reserve suffers from water shortages due to heavy demands from irrigation projects, connected to the Demirk√∂pr√º Dam. High level of urbanization and industrialization along its basin also caused Gediz River to suffer severe pollution, particularly by sand and gravel quarries and leather industry. These factors contributed to the river's formerly rich fish reserves to become a thing of the past in recent years.

Born in Manchester, Knowles worked with Alfred Hitchcock on numerous occasions before the director emigrated to Hollywood. Knowles later graduated as a director and screenwriter, directing a number of high-profile films, including the 1946 Gainsborough Melodrama The Magic Bow. He worked a great deal on television shows, including Fabian of the Yard, Dial 999, Ivanhoe and The Adventures of Robin Hood. Career =Cinematographer= Knowles' early credits include Mumsie (1927) and Dawn (1928) for Herbert Wilcox. He also shot Love's Option (1928), The Broken Melody (1929), The Silver King (1929), Auld Lang Syne (1929), Rookery Nook (1930), The Nipper (1930), French Leave (1930), School for Scandal (1930), Canaries Sometimes Sing (1930), The Calendar (1931), The Hound of the Baskervilles (1931), and White Face (1932). Knowles went on to shoot The Good Companions (1933), Falling for You (1933) and working on the lighting for Jew S√ºss (1934). He shot Jack Ahoy (1934) and The Camels are Coming (1934). =Alfred Hitchcock= Knowles combined with Alfred Hitchcock on The 39 Steps (1935). He shot Forever England (1935), King of the Damned (1935) and Rhodes of Africa (1936). Knowles and Hitchcock were reunited on Secret Agent (1936) and Sabotage (1936). In between Knowles filmed East Meets West (1936). Knowles shot Take My Tip(1937) then was back for Hitchcock on Young and Innocent (1937). He did some uncredited camera work on King Solomon's Mines (1937). Knowles shot The Mikado (1939) and was back with Hitchcock for Jamaica Inn (1939), the last movie the director made before moving to the US. Knowles shot French Without Tears (1940) for Anthony Asquith; Spy for a Day (1940); Gaslight (1940), for Thorold Dickinson; Freedom Radio (1941) and Quiet Wedding (1941) for Asquith; The Saint's Vacation (1941); Jeannie (1941), The Day Will Dawn (1942), Unpublished Story (1942), Secret Mission (1942) and Talk About Jacqueline (1942) for Harold French; The Demi-Paradise (1943) for Asquith; and English Without Tears (1944) for French. =Director= Knowles went to Gainsborough Pictures to shoot Love Story (1944). It was a huge hit and the studio gave him the chance to direct with A Place of One's Own (1945) starring their two biggest stars, James Mason and Margaret Lockwood. It was not a financial success. However Knowles' next film as director, The Magic Bow (1946), a biopic of Niccol√≤ Paganini starring Stewart Granger, was better received. So too was the drama The Man Within (1947) with Michael Redgrave. Knowles had a big hit with Jassy (1947) starring Lockwood. He left Gainsborough to direct The White Unicorn (1947) for producer John Corfeld. He then directed two popular comedies, Easy Money (1948), and The Perfect Woman (1949), co-writing the latter. Knowles directed The Lost People (1949) with Muriel Box. Knowles did The Reluctant Widow (1950) with Jean Kent, an attempt to reprise the success of the Gainsborough melodramas. =Television= Later films as director included some B Pictures, Park Plaza 605 (1953) and Barbados Quest (1955) with Tom Conway. He began to work in television, directing episodes of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. Presents (1953), Fabian of the Yard (1953), Colonel March of Scotland Yard (1956), The New Adventures of Martin Kane (1957), Sword of Freedom (1957), The Adventures of Sir Lancelot (1956‚Äì57), The Buccaneers (1956‚Äì57), Ivanhoe (1958‚Äì59), Target (1958), Dial 999 (1958), and The Adventures of Robin Hood (1960). =Later career= Knowles' later directing credits include Frozen Alive (1964), and Spaceflight IC-1: An Adventure in Space (1965). He co-directed Hell Is Empty (1967) and was the director on Magical Mystery Tour (1967), starring The Beatles.See old-time Britain on the Beatles' bus Finkelstein, DanielAuthor InformationView Profile.

He composed mostly for cello (including several concertos and many technical studies), but also wrote orchestral pieces, chamber music, piano music and songs. Gr√ºtzmacher was born in Dessau, Anhalt, and was first taught by his father. Soon he began studying cello with Dotzauer's pupil, Karl Dreschler (1800-1873). In 1848 he was discovered in Leipzig by the famous violinist, Ferdinand David, who arranged some concerts for him. In 1850 he became solo cellist in the Leipzig theatre orchestra, the Gewandhaus Concerts, and professor at the Leipzig Conservatory. He played in the David String Quartet. In 1860 Gr√ºtzmacher moved to Dresden to be principal cellist of the Court Orchestra, and head of the Dresden Musical Society. In 1877 he became a professor at the Dresden Conservatory. He concertized all over Europe and Imperial Russia, where he became a friend of the famous cellist Karl Davydov. He played the first performance of Richard Strauss's Don Quixote in Cologne in 1898. He was the teacher of Wilhelm Fitzenhagen, and Hugo Becker, whose editions are still used. Gr√ºtzmacher is most famous today for taking samples of four different works to form his edition of Luigi Boccherini's Concerto in B-flat, still being published and performed. He is also known for rearranging J.S. Bach's Cello Suites with additional chords, passages and embellishments. His cadenzas for the cello concertos by Boccherini and Joseph Haydn are often performed to this day. He made frequent tours throughout Europe and Russia as a solo cellist and chamber musician.

Along with composer Stephen Paulus, she is a co-founder of the Minnesota Composers Forum, now the American Composers Forum. A former holder of the Papamarkou Chair at John W. Kluge Center of the Library of Congress, Larsen has also held residencies with the Minnesota Orchestra, the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra and the Colorado Symphony Orchestra.‚ÄúNews from the Library of Congress‚Äù, loc.gov; accessed December 28, 2012. Biography =Early life= Libby Larsen was born on December 24, 1950 in Wilmington, Delaware, the daughter of Robert Larsen and Alice Brown Larsen. She was the third of five daughters in the family, and at the age of three, Libby and her family moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota. Her first musical experience dates from the time when she was three years old. She observed her older sister's piano lessons at home; later, she imitated what she had heard. Her formal music education began at the Saint Joseph of Carondelet nuns at Christ the King School. All students sang Gregorian Chant and learned to sight-read using moveable ‚Äòdo‚Äô solfege. The rhythmic flexibility and prosody of text Larsen learned in chant showed her that there is freedom in music, a concept that would prove to be very influential in her future compositions. In addition to her classical training, Larsen's father was an amateur clarinetist in a Dixieland band, and her mother played boogie-woogie on the record player, giving her a multifarious and very American musical background. =Musical career= Larsen attended the University of Minnesota for both her undergraduate and graduate work. She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Theory and Composition in 1971, a Masters of Arts degree in Composition in 1975, and a PhD in Theory and Composition in 1978. Throughout her studies at university, she studied composition with Dominick Argento, Paul Fetler and Eric Stokes. In 1975, Larsen married her husband, James Reece, whom she met at university. In 1973, Larsen co-founded the Minnesota Composers Forum with colleague Stephen Paulus with the goal to provide a public platform and an audience for the creation and performance of new compositions, along with giving practical help in business matters such as applying for fellowships and negotiating contracts. In 1996, the organization changed its name to the American Composers Forum and established chapters in cities throughout the country including New York, Atlanta, Washington D.C. and Los Angeles, among others. Its base is still in St. Paul, Minnesota.‚ÄúAmerican Composers Forum: Mission and History‚Äù, composersforum.org; accessed March 24, 2011. In 1983, Larsen was appointed one of the Minnesota Orchestra's two composers-in- residence, making her the first woman to serve as a resident composer with a major orchestra.Marilyn Biery. \\"New Music for Organ at the End of the Twentieth Century: A Series on the Compositions of Six American Composers\\", in: The American Organist, July 2000, 76-78. She composed her first symphony, Water Music, for the Minnesota Orchestra, which was premiered in 1985 under Sir Neville Marriner. During her time with the Minnesota Orchestra, Larsen researched reasons for the low attendance of people of her own age at classical concerts and why non-European composers were not adequately represented in concert programs. This led her to studies of classical music in America and its place in American culture, the results of which she has explored in her compositions and other philosophical projects.DeSmith, Christy. \\"Loading the Canon\\", in: The Rake, November 2005, 57-62. In 1986, her daughter Wynne was born. Larsen organized and became artistic director of the Hot Notes Series (sponsored by the Schubert Club of St. Paul) in 1993, which focuses on the modern keyboard, particularly on the interaction between performer and synthesized sound. This interaction has become a feature of her later works, including Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus (1990) based on the book by Mary Shelley. This work used electronic visual effects such as projectors and screens around the theater which showed different perspectives (e.g. those of the monster or those of Frankenstein himself) throughout the opera. This opera was Larsen's first exploration of technological sound and was selected as one of the eight best classical music events of 1990 by USA Today.\\"Classical: Batons Hint at a Brave New World\\", in: USA Today, December 24, 1990, 2D. In 1993, she won a Grammy Award for producer of Best Classical Vocal Performance for \\"The Art of Arlene Aug√©r\\", featuring her song cycle Sonnets from the Portuguese. In 1996, she received Honorary Doctorates from both St. Mary's College/Notre Dame, and the University of Nebraska. In addition to being known as a composer, Larsen is known as a musical philosopher and speaker. She has given keynote addresses at places such as the League of American Orchestras, American Choral Directors Association, American Orff-Schulwerk Association National Convention, Concert Band Directors National Association, Dominique de Menil Presidential Lecture Series at Rice University (2001), Music Educators National Convention, and National Association of Schools of Music. From 2003-04, she served as the first Harissios Papamarkou Chair in Education and Technology at the Library of Congress.Libby Larsen: Biography, libbylarsen.com, March 24, 2011. In 2010, Larsen received a George Peabody Medal for Outstanding Contributions to Music in America.Royce, Graydon. \\"Minneapolis composer wins Peabody Medal\\", in: Star Tribune, May 27, 2010.\\"Renowned composer honors Linfield with pair of concerts\\", in: News Register, April 13, 2011. Influences When asked about her influences, Larsen responded, \\"To tell the truth, my teachers have come to me from unexpected places in my musical life. They have been poets, architects, painters and philosophers. The other way I really learn is by reading scores voraciously, from Chuck Berry to Witold Lutos≈Çawski.\\" Style and approach Her style and approach to music comes from her own philosophy on music. Her music comes from the sound she hears everyday around her in the world. It is noted for its \\"energy, optimism, rhythmic diversity, colourful orchestration, liberated tonality without harsh dissonance, and pervading lyricism.\\" The rhythms used are often taken directly from the American language: \\"our own American language has beautiful rhythms in it; it is this American vernacular and the rhythm of our American life that is the language of my music.\\"Libby Larsen: FAQ-On Music, libbylarsen.com; accessed March 24, 2011. Pieces such as Holy Roller (about a revivalist preacher‚Äôs speech) and Bid Call (about auctioneering patterns) showcase this style. Larsen composes without barlines, preferring to first discover the natural flow of a line and then refine it until she finds a common meter, giving many of her compositions a feeling of free internal rhythm.Smith, Ken. \\"Floating free\\", in: Choir and Organ, November/December 2001, 43-35.

He wrote the ballad \\"The Bould Thady Quill\\" (c.1895), a spoof on a non-athlete, and two other noted poems: ‚ÄúThe Battle Ship Sinn F√©in‚Äù (c.1905), his only patriotic piece, and ‚ÄúThe Wild Bar-A-Boo‚Äù (c.1910), spoofing the noted Muskerry fox chase that originated in Ballincollig and passed through his townland near Rylane, County Cork. He wrote many more poems of little consequence, mostly spoofing his neighbors and acquaintances. Biography =Early life and education= John (\\"Johnny Tom\\") Gleeson was born 26 July 1853 in Rylane to a farmer, Thomas Gleeson (1795-1871), and his wife Mary Golden (? - c.1910). Mary was the aunt of another famous Corkman, Peter Golden (1877-1926): author, actor, poet and patriot. . While most of the Gleesons were poets, Johnny had a double advantage as his mother (Golden) was also a poet and a woman of considerable learning. Mary was also related to Terence MacSwiney (1879-1920), the martyred Lord-Mayor of Cork. Her brother conducted a \\"Latin\\" school in Macroom and among his pupils was An tAthair Peadar. In his youth, Johnny Tom apparently took little interest in sports, hunting, or farming, being more interested in reading, music, and socializing. He grew to be around 5'-8\\" tall. This broad-shouldered, handsome man with brown eyes and light brown hair stood out in any crowd. At age 17, he became the man of the house, which did not suit his sedentary inclinations. Johnny Tom, trying to follow in his brother's priestly footsteps, reportedly enrolled in a seminary, but for some reason, possibly the regimented life, he returned to his family's farm. =Career= Although having little desire or knack for running a farm, he did half-heartedly give it a try. In his mid-years, apparently he hired help and share-cropped his farm. In later years he neglected the farm totally, letting the cattle and his house shift for themselves and letting his fields deteriorate. His farm was known as the \\"Wild West.\\" Johnny Tom was known as being tight-fisted with his money, never paying his bills on time. He was also quick to borrow tools, but slow to return them. Whenever he needed money, he would wander out into the fields hopefully to find a young cow, lamb, or foal he could sell. Obviously, Johnny Tom's talents lay elsewhere than farming. Not only could he compose poetry as fast as he could talk, but he was a very accomplished musician, playing both the accordion and the flute. He also had a very pleasant tenor voice. In this regard, Johnny Tom was more noted for his lilting or \\"dideling\\" (i.e., the rapid \\"di-diddle-dee-dee\\" approach to singing). These musical talents allowed him to set several of his poems to music. His musical and poetic talents were in demand at every local social gathering. Johnny Tom played and sang at set-dances in the vale below his uncle David Gleeson's house. This same vale was on the route of the noted Muskerry fox chase, which Johnny Tom immortalized in his ballad \\"The Wild Bar- A-Boo.\\" None of Johnny Tom's known poems ever speak of romance, loves lost, or idyllic women. He never married. Most of his poems and ballads were satirical or remembrances of people and events. Johnny Tom was quiet and gentle, but set in his ways. He was eccentric in many ways: Johnny Tom always carried a bill- hook (hook-shaped knife) with him; he used it for shaving, cutting tobacco, skinning animals, cutting bread, and other needs. He kept all his victuals in a large, iron pot. With its lid turned upside down, he also used it as stool. In later life at least, he slept with his clothes on. Because his featherbed was torn, he was always covered in feathers. He was also never seen without a bowler hat. =Death= About two months before his death, in failing health, Johnny Tom sold his farm and moved in with Paddy (c.1878 - c.1925) and Lena (c.1870 - c.1933) Corkery, his neighbors. Paddy and Johnny Tom were related through the Golden line. The Corkerys' daughter, Hanna Maria (1904 ‚Äì 1989) and Mrs. Corkery nursed Johnny Tom until his death on 21 July 1924. He died of heart failure in the Corkery's settle bed. His last words were to Hanna Maria, asking her for a glass of water. On Sunday, 16 August 1970, a plaque was unveiled by a group of Cork dignitaries to mark the grave of Johnny Tom near the wall outside South Kilmurry Church. He is buried in Aghabullogue graveyard.

He attended the Boston University School of Music, the New England Conservatory and is a graduate of The Cleveland Institute of Music. His violin studies were with Dorothy DeLay, conducting with Carl Topilow and composition with Donald Erb and Margaret Brouwer. A relative newcomer to conducting, he has appeared as a guest conductor with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, the Colorado Symphony Orchestra, the Chicago Sinfonietta, and many other ensembles. He has recorded several CDs for the Naxos Records label, all in their American Classics series, where he has shown a remarkable ability to uncover lost gems by American composers of the first half of the 20th century (such as Henry Hadley and John Alden Carpenter), and bring them vividly to life with the National Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine and the National Radio Symphony Orchestra of Ukraine. The resurgence of interest in western American composer George Frederick McKay (1899-1970) can be attributed to William's pioneering Naxos recordings of McKay's music. He was awarded a Grammy in 2007 for his recording of Olivier Messiaen's Oiseaux exotiques, in which he conducted the Cleveland Chamber Symphony with pianist Angelin Chang, who also received a Grammy. Williams has received a total of four Grammy nominations. Williams has also served as assistant conductor of the Britt Festival in Oregon. As a violinist, he has appeared as a soloist around the United States and was an active freelancer in the Boston area, where he was assistant concertmaster of the Boston Pops Esplanade Orchestra and played as a substitute with the Boston Symphony. Williams was also a member of the Houston Symphony, and was concertmaster of the Virginia Symphony. His first solo violin recording is set for release and contains world premiere recordings of the complete violin music by Karl Weigl, and will appear on the Sono Luminus label.

It is in limited release and has been screened in the U.S., Mexico and Scotland. According to a P.O.V. press release, The Tailenders was broadcast nationally in the US on PBS on Tuesday, July 25, 2006. The film follows Gospel Recordings, an evangelical Christian missionary group founded by Joy Ridderhof in California in 1939Web page to make audio recordings of Bible stories in every language on Earth. The group is part of the umbrella network GRN - Global Recordings Network which has sister offices in over 30 countries. The film claims there are over 8,000 languages and dialects in the world and, as of the making of the film, Global Recordings Network has recorded Bible stories in 5,485 of them. It is mentioned in the film that their archive houses more spoken languages in one place than any other single area in the world. The significance of this lies in the notion that the Bible is not only the most published book around the world, passages from it are also translated into the most spoken languages as well. Many of the languages utilized by Gospel Recordings do not have written counterparts, and even if they did, most who spoke the languages would not be able to read it anyway. A benefit of this group's work is the growing set of unspoken languages that are catalogued over the years, which act as a strong counterpart to historical records of various cultures. \\"The Tailenders\\" claim that half of all languages occur in eight countries. Global Recordings Network, founded in Los Angeles in 1939, specifically targets indigenous people in remote areas of the world. In the years of 2002 and 2003 the organization prearranged trips to The Solomon Islands, Mexico, and India. Three countries termed the \\"tailenders\\" since they were the last group of people to be reached by missionaries transmitting the message of God, unchanged. In the three countries mentioned earlier, there are a total of 769 different languages and dialects spoken, 74 in The Solomon Islands, 295 in Mexico, and 400 in India. The film attempts to explore the connection between missionary activity and global capitalism by using low-tech audio devices to speak to communities that face economic crisis. The missionaries targeted these communities that were in crisis because they found that displaced and desperate people were more receptive to evangelical recordings. Also because these people were more interested in the audio recordings because they were more comfortable with listening to their native language. It seems to provide an interesting view on mass-evangelization as the filmmaker shows the viewer that by placing a concentrated emphasis on these native people and using a recording of their own language as a way of connection to Christianity; to make them feel comfortable in learning a new way of thinking about the world. The role of technology in the film The makers of the documentary emphasize the strategy of reaching and giving communication technology to those facing hardships in their very own land. For example: the communities in Patutiva, Solomon Islands faced the threat of logging which would consequently lead to no water, homes, and the destruction of the native ecosystem. The narrator of the documentary also seeks to explain why the devices they used to spread the gospel message were so effective. \\"Separated from its body, a voice become superhuman,\\" she explains, \\"It can speak to more people than any single person could.\\" The native tongue on the recordings allowed Global Recordings Network to bring a source of comfort and trust for people who have been long separated from their homeland. They used the inherent appeal of the medium to gain converts. The film \\"has presented disembodied audio as a religion unto itself.\\" Because of the low development in these places, devices had to be used that could work without the use of electricity. The devices they used to are referred to as \\"Hand Crank\\" and consisted of cardboard record players and hand cranked cassette players. They take apart pieces of technology and re-assemble them in order to make the technology serve their purposes. They used people within the cultures who understood and spoke the different dialects in order to record the stories they wanted to share from the Bible. To make sure that the stories were authentic, translators were used. The \\"Hand Crank\\" cassette players were a tool of attraction in itself. They were made with deliberately bold colored buttons that would attract the attention of the children. The \\"Hand Crank\\" would even attract the adults who have never been exposed to the missionaries before. The missionaries also made it a point to charge the people of these poor third world nations for the cassettes made by The Global Recording Network. The missionaries felt that the people valued the messages on the tape and the tape itself more when they have to purchase it, rather them being handed the tapes free. Global evangelism and human language The Global Recordings Network worked to translate the biblical messages and songs into every language possible. They trained recordists to choose the most appropriate scripts in order to appeal most to specific groups of people. They had scripts prepared to target many different groups from spirit-worshipers to Muslims or Buddhists. Recordists go into villages and conduct interviews with community members in order to decide which scripts would be most appropriate to gain converts in that area. The final products of the scripts that are recorded appeal to the specific groups of people because the \\"Spirit\\" speaks through background noises such as children's voices, bugs, and other sounds that relate to their cultural environment. The missionaries developed a diagnostic procedure to determine a person's exact native language or dialect. They did so by playing audio samples in differing dialects until the individuals heard their native language. Finding their exact language helps the people relate back to their homeland because most of them have been uprooted to find jobs. These people are in need of something to fall back on and these biblical recordings helps them relate and continue their faith. An example of this includes their trip to a poor village in India. The documentary focused on one older Indian couple that were having financial troubles. The wife leaves at 7 a.m. every morning and returns at 5 p.m. every night. The wage she earns is less than a dollar for a 10-hour work day. The husband is unable to work because of a medical condition called 'vertigo'. Employers did not hire him due to this, and thus, he cannot make any money. The missionaries talked to the husband. The effectiveness of audio native- language evangelism Some common problems that they encountered were language mix-ups and background noise. Although these problems were serious to the spread of their message, it seemed foolish that the devices were given to people who were so poor that they could not afford to fix holes in their roofs The missionaries purposely sold the tapes for monetary value so they would value the tapes and listen to them more. Along those lines when the recipients that were given the technology asked for other assistance, the givers simply told them they would \\"pray for them.\\" More problems include the fact that some messages get lost in translation. An example of this was clearly shown in the documentary when they played a popular children's game called \\"telephone.\\" The sentence, \\"Air carries the vibration to the recording device\\" was passed in English from one person to the next, who then passed it along in Hindi, then Nepali, then Manipuri, then Tangkhul, then Manipuri, and then back to English. At this point, it became \\"When we record the language, after we record, it's come out...its come out through the vibration.\\" One short sentence became a long, descriptive passage with a slightly altered meaning. When one story or message gets translated into over 500 languages, the emphasis may shift, and meanings may differ. Different words mean different things to different people in different cultures. The missionaries often picked translators who spoke clearly and had knowledge of the local language to help them record the Bible passages. Some of the translators used by the missionaries would take liberties with the translations that deviated from the core message. For example, one translator told a fictitious Bible story about a pig. The missionaries were not aware of this until later when they played the finished tape for someone else who spoke the same language. The work of the GRN is controversial in some of the communities they work in. In Oaxaca, some community leaders noted that converts often become less willing to engage in community projects to increase social welfare, instead focusing on bettering their own family's situation and praying for everyone else. At the end of the film, the narrator explains the effect of the missionaries work, saying, \\"the strongest message received may be the technology itself. An emblem of wealthy machine culture and its power. To convert is to be joined to this power.\\"  Reactions  Colin Stott, the US Director of Global Recordings Network (GRN), the organization whose efforts are the subject of \\"The Tailenders,\\" has expressed displeasure at the way the film depicted his organization. In an open letter, Stott condemned filmmaker Adele Horne for her \\"skewed perspective\\" on the work GRN does. He says that Horne's finished work misrepresents the organization's motives, competence, and their ability to effectively spread the word of the Bible, which is their mission. Furthermore, Stott claims that Horne did not make changes requested by GRN and that his organization did not sponsor or authorize the film. The critical response to the film was very positive, although some reviewers criticized the interpretation provided by the voice-over. The Wall Street Journal noted, \\"Annoyingly, the documentary is interrupted by the cryptic and often political musings of filmmaker Adele Horne.\\"  Awards  * \\"Axium Truer Than Fiction Award,\\" Film Independent's 2007 Spirit Awards * National PBS Broadcast on P.O.V. * Documentary Fortnight, Museum of Modern Art  Screenings  This movie deals directly with course content from a University of Illinois course called Speech Communications 199B (Communication Technology and Society) taught by Professor Christian Sandvig. In this course topics are covered that correlate with ideas behind different forms of technology and their effectiveness in presenting different messages. A screening of the film was required of each student enrolled in the course. Two screenings were April 3 and 4, 2007 on the University of Illinois campus. Few people attended the first screening of the film on April 3. Other students, besides those in Professor Sandvig's class, attended the filming simply for pleasure. Advertising for the screenings was through fliers that Professor Sandvig and other Speech Communications students put up around campus. The film is available at the Media & Reserve Services at the university's Undergraduate library, where it can be viewed in a media viewing cubicle.

He was a National Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for East Fife from 1933 until his death, and was the sessional chairman of the Parliamentary Party in 1945. He played an important role in negotiating the unity of the National Liberals with the Conservatives, but was unable to persuade the Liberal Party to join as well. Early life Henderson-Stewart was born at Crieff, Perthshire, the son of Matthew Stewart. He attended Morrison's Academy in the town, interrupting his education to join the Royal Artillery and serve in the First World War. Promoted to Acting Captain in February 1918,The Times, 22 February 1918. he was wounded in action. He left the Army in 1919, placed as a Captain on the Reserve of Officers, and went to the University of Edinburgh where he obtained a Bachelor of Commerce degree in 1922 and a Master of Arts degree in Economics in 1923. He was in the Territorial Army from 1921 to 1925. Liberal Party candidacies At the 1923 general election Stewart was Liberal Party candidate for Leicester East, but finished in third place with only 27% of the vote. In the 1924 general election he fought Derby as the sole Liberal candidate, opposing J. H. Thomas who was a senior Labour Minister. His task was reckoned \\"a difficult one\\" \\"Derbyshire Seats\\", The Times, 24 October 1924. and he again finished bottom of the poll. During the 1920s Henderson-Stewart worked at the British Overseas Bank in London. His political activity occurred through the Land and Nation League, a Liberal body which had been set up to promote the land policy which was being promoted by David Lloyd George. By 1929 he was Secretary of the League,\\"The Times House of Commons 1929\\", p. 122. and he was selected as the Liberal candidate for Dundee. Like Derby this was a two-member constituency but unlike Derby the Conservatives nominated only one candidate, and it was recognised that Liberal and Conservative voters (each of whom had two votes) would use their second vote for the other party's candidate.\\"Prohibitionist At Dundee\\", The Times, 21 May 1929. Henderson-Stewart finished as runner-up, some 13,712 votes from winning a seat but having put in a creditable performance. East Fife election In January 1933, Henderson-Stewart was adopted as Liberal National candidate for East Fife, where the death of the sitting Member of Parliament Sir James Duncan Millar had precipitated a by-election. He obtained the support of the Unionists,\\"The East Fife Election\\", The Times, 17 January 1933. although he faced opposition not only from the Labour Party and the Scottish National Party but also the Agricultural Party (whose candidate proclaimed himself a Conservative)\\"The East Fife By-Election\\", The Times, 23 January 1933. and an unofficial Liberal who supported free trade. Lord Snowden, the former Labour Chancellor, sent a message of support to the unofficial Liberal, which Henderson-Stewart described as \\"little more than an ill-natured outburst\\",\\"'An Ill-Natured Outburst'\\", The Times, 28 January 1933. Member of Parliament Henderson-Stewart won with a comfortable majority of 9,135, and in his victory speech attacked the \\"wrecking tactics\\" of the Agricultural and unofficial Liberal candidates.\\"East Fife\\", The Times, 4 February 1933. He gained a reputation for diligent constituency work, among the farmers and fishermen of Fife, and soon after his election opposed a reduction in the grant to the Forestry Commission which he considered a false economy. He often spoke on economic questions.

It celebrated the history of the Toronto waterfront, the history of commerce on the Great Lakes, and the role of maritime commerce in the development of the City of Toronto. History The Toronto Maritime Museum was established in 1957 as the Marine Museum of Upper Canada. It was opened by its patron Earl Mountbatten of Burma on August 26, 1959.http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/bylaws/1999/law0188.htm It was first located in the historic Stanley Barracks' Officers' Quarters on the grounds of the Canadian National Exhibition. In 1964, it was proposed to display a selection of historic ships: the PS Trillium former island ferry, the Venetia a Chinese trader, the G. R. Geary steam tug, the Naiad yacht, and the St. Lawrence, a 100-gun gunboat that was sunk in Kingston, Ontarios harbour. The proposal was made by Guy Clarkson of the Ontario Economic Council to the Toronto City Councils Parks and Recreation Committee, which turned it down. A collection of the city's maritime history including model ships was housed at the former military barracks. On the outside, the museum displayed the tugboat Ned Hanlan, along with a large ship anchor and screw. Although not related to the museum's purpose, ex-CN Rail / Canadian Northern Railway locomotive 6213 was stored outside. In 2000, the museum was moved to Pier 4 at 245 Queens Quay West at a former warehouse (c. 1930s), which is closer to downtown, and more accessible for tourists. This facility was once a marine warehouse built in the 1930s. The museum featured a number of historic model ships.http://www.thenrg.org/MIS/up-canda.html?nauticalresearchguild=hwkmmpdq The museum site was operated by City of Toronto Culture Division. Despite the relocation, the museum was closed in 2008 and there appears to be no active plan to restore the museum. The exhibits are currently in storage, and organizers are looking for funding. The two outdoor displays were eventually relocated. CN Locomotive 6213 was transferred to the Toronto Railway Museum. Some restoration has taken place and is now stored indoors at the former roundhouse. Tugboat Ned Hanlan was relocated to Hanlan's Point Ferry Terminal on Toronto Islands in 2012. The Harbourfront building was repurposed for a pet activity centre and is currently a craft beer store and restaurant. The former barracks building is now part of the Hotel X Toronto project.

Design and development A captured German Albatros J.I on display in the United States, circa 1919 The Albatros J.I was a \\"J-class\\" derivative of the Albatros C.XII reconnaissance aircraft. The J.I utilized the wings and tail of the C.XII, which were joined to a new slab- sided fuselage. The crew compartment was protected by 490 kg (1,080 lb) of steel armor plate, while the engine was left unprotected. The sides and bottom were 5 mm thick chrome nickel steel plate that was bolted to the wood frame. Power was provided by the 150 kW (200 hp) Benz Bz.IV, which gave marginal performance when combined with the heavy J.I airframe. The fixed 7.92 mm (.312 in) machine guns fired downward to facilitate strafing ground targets. The Albatros J.I was developed for low-altitude battlefield reconnaissance and ground-attack missions, often at altitudes of 50 meters (150 feet) or less. Albatros J.Is were mainly issued to Flieger Abteilungen in support of the Army Corps or Army Headquarters. German units began receiving the J.Is in April 1918 and they were first used in the Battle of the Lys. The aircraft was popular with crews, due to the armor protection and good visibility of the low set engine. Operationally a success, the main drawback of the type was the inadequate armor. By June 1918, the new Albatros J.II started to replace J.I at the front. The older aircraft nevertheless served until the Armistice. Two were bought by Austria-Hungary. After the war, it was still operated by Poland, Norway, Ukraine.

The pure sheep milk is curdled using a coagulant found in the pistils of cardoon (Cynara cardunculus). This ingredient lends a light bitterness to the otherwise slightly salty taste. It is aged for at least sixty days. When the cheese has a creamy consistency in the centre, it is traditionally eaten by slicing off the top and scooping out the inside with a spoon, and it is known as Torta de la Serena. If it is allowed to mature further it becomes harder, develops a stronger taste and is known as Queso de la Serena. Torta de la Serena differs from the Torta del Casar, which is also made in Extremadura, because it is made only from Merino sheep milk, whereas Torta del Casar is made from milk from mixed breeds; and also because less rennet (coagulant) is used. These two conditions result in a milder cheese. It differs from Queijo Serra da Estrela, made in neighbouring Portugal, because, although Queijo Serra da Estrela is, like Torta de la Serena, made entirely from Merino sheep milk, is uses more rennet (more even than Torta del Casar). This results in Queijo Serra da Estrela having a stronger, more bitter taste. The Torta de la Serena is a PDO.

They played initially between 1963 and 1965, and recorded many of their best known songs in the period, including \\"Guns of Navarone.\\" They also played on records by Prince Buster and backed many other Jamaican artists who recorded during that period, including Bob Marley & The Wailers, on their first single Simmer Down. They reformed in 1983 and have played together ever since. History =Before the Skatalites: 1954‚Äì64= The founders of the Skatalites were Tommy McCook (died 1998), Rolando Alphonso (died 1998), Lester Sterling, Lloyd Brevett (died 2012), Lloyd Knibb (died 2011), Don Drummond (died 1969), Jah Jerry Haynes (died 2007), Jackie Mittoo (died 1990), Johnny Moore (died 2008) and Jackie Opel (died 1970). These ten musicians started to play together from 1955, when Kingston's recording studios started to develop. Tommy McCook was the first member of the band to record, though not for commercial release: he played with Don Hitchman's Group in 1953. Archie Lindo asked Hitchman to play a few tunes for his pioneer radio station, \\"ZQI\\", on their new equipment. Soon after that, sound system pioneer Stanley Motta began to operate his studio, where he recorded calypso and mento that were released on 78's. Rolando Alphonso was one of the first to record with him, probably in 1954. Though McCook was the first in the band to record, he did not participate in the recording sessions with the other nine musicians. He left Jamaica in 1954 for a jazz gig at the Zanzibar Club in Nassau, Bahamas. He returned to Jamaica in June 1962, and began playing regular jazz sessions around Kingston. Record producer Coxsone Dodd searched for jazz players around Kingston and was impressed by McCook's playing. Tommy McCook heard some ska, but initially resisted Dodd's offers to record and to lead a studio group, because he was a committed jazzman. In 1962 Dodd released I Cover The Waterfront (Port-O-Jam) with Roland Alphonso and Don Drummond, who did the solo and brass sections. In 1963 he released Jazz Jamaica From the Workshop (Port-O-Jam/Studio One), on which McCook played for the first time since returning to Jamaica. Don Drummond has two tunes on Jazz Jamaica and McCook has one, \\"The Answer\\". =Early years: 1964‚Äì65= In spring 1964, The Skatalites recorded their first LP Ska Authentic at Studio One in Kingston and toured Jamaica as the creators of ska. Their producers were Coxsone Dodd, Duke Reid, Prince Buster, Vincent \\"King\\" Edwards, Justin \\"Phillip\\" Yap, Leslie Kong, Lindon Pottinger, Sonia Pottinger and Vincent \\"Randy\\" Chin. The Skatalites led sessions with top artists and worked with young talents such as Delroy Wilson, Desmond Dekker, The Wailers, Lee Perry, etc. They played their first show on 27 June at the Hi-Hat club, on Water Lane in Rae Town, which was owned and operated by Orville \\"Billy\\" Farnum. Coxsone Dodd helped initially: \\"At the formation of the band, I supplied the PA system, microphones and what ever it is. Also the guitar amplifier and other amplifier. I helped with transportation and I supplied storage for equipment and instruments. I was a part of promoting the first gigs and other gigs to get it off the ground, because I figured more or less, if I am recording the Skatalites, its good to get them popular out in the streets, yunno?\\"History, The Skatalites website. Trombonist Don Drummond had at least 200 tunes to his name by 1965. On 1 January 1965, Drummond was arrested for the murder of his girlfriend, Anita \\"Marguerita\\" Mahfood. He was later convicted and remanded to the Bellevue Asylum. In August 1965, The Skatalites played their last show. They broke up into two supergroups, Rolando Alphonso and the Soul Vendors and Tommy McCook and the Supersonics. In April 1967, The Skatalites' ska adaptation of the theme to the film The Guns of Navarone entered the Top 40 of the UK Singles Chart. Don Drummond died on 6 May 1969, in the Bellevue Asylum. =Early reunions: 1974‚Äì88= The Skatalites first reunion happened in the studio, during 1974 sessions for bass player Lloyd Brevett's solo album. After laying down hand percussion tracks at Lee Perry's studio, Brevett was joined by McCook, Alphonso, Sterling, Knibb and Mittoo. Ernest Ranglin played guitar, with Oswald Brooks on trumpet.African Roots 1997 Moon Ska records edition liner notes The album was eventually released as African Roots, a collection of mostly Brevett compositions, and has been variously released both as a Lloyd Brevett and as a Skatalies album, with most editions crediting \\"Lloyd Brevett and The Skatalites\\". In 1979, The Skatalites again joined in the studio, this time to record an album for Chris Blackwell. The album, tentatively entitled The Big Guns, was not released at the time, due to a disagreement between McCook and Blackwell, and remains unreleased. In June 1983, The Skatalites reformed and played the Reggae Sunsplash festival in Montego Bay in July after festival director Ronnie Burke persuaded them to appear at the fifth anniversary of the festival, despite Moore and McCook having not spoken since the band split.Campbell, Charles (2012) \\"The Skatalites musical journey\\", Jamaica Observer, 20 May 2012, retrieved 1 June 2012,Johnson, Richard (2012) \\"When the Skatalites reunited for Sunsplash\\", Jamaica Observer, 15 June 2012, retrieved 17 June 2012. Their show was very successfulLloyd Knibb biography, Skatalites officialwebsite. and the band played more concerts in Jamaica, while taking offers to tour abroad. The line- up at this time reflected the original line-up of the band, with the exception of Drummond, joined by guests Cedric Brooks, Arnold Breckenridge, and Bubbles Cameron.Liner notes, \\"Stretching Out\\", ROIR records. Recordings from 27 June and 17 July 1983 were released on the live album Stretching Out, although the band later claimed on their website that they received no payment for this recording and discouraged fans from buying it. Their rehearsal sessions resulted in a clutch of new songs, led this time by Jackie Mittoo, which were recorded in Music Mountain Studio but only released in 2007 on Motion Records (as Rolling Steady: The 1983 Music Mountain Sessions). The album included their tribute to Don Drummond, \\"Big Trombone\\", with Lord Tanamo on vocals. In April 1984, The Skatalites recorded The Return of The Big Guns, released on Mango Records in the UK, based on charts written by Drummond and arranged by McCook. On 7 July 1984, The Skatalites played to thousands at Selhurst Park during the London Sunsplash. The Skatalites played seven tunes and also backed Prince Buster on three before closing with a reprise of their theme song, \\"Freedom Sounds\\". This concert resulted in the live recording Live At Sunsplash. Between 1985 and 1988, the core members of the Skatalites emigrated and united in the northeast of the United States. They played their first US concert at The Village Gate and began to play spotted dates in Northeast US. =1989‚Äìpresent= The Skatalites were featured on the album True Love by Toots and the Maytals, which won the Grammy Award in 2004 for Best Reggae Album, and showcased many notable musicians including Willie Nelson, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Trey Anastasio, Gwen Stefani / No Doubt, Ben Harper, Bonnie Raitt, Manu Chao, The Roots, Ryan Adams, Keith Richards, Toots Hibbert, Paul Douglas, Jackie Jackson, and Ken Boothe.\\"True Love - Linear CD Notes.\\" Toots and the Maytals. tootsandthemaytals.net.

He toured briefly leading his own band, and then retired to Jamaica. In April that year, the Skatalites started a new world tour with their new bass player Val Douglas, whose A-Team band was the primary backing band for Reggae Sunsplash Tours through the 1980s and 1990s.

Human Development Index (HDI) According to a survey by the Instituto Pereira Passos (Pereira Passos Institute) and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, in 2000 Realengo reached the 89th position in the rank of HDI. Public Health State Hospital Albert Schweitzer serves a population of around 700 thousand inhabitants. The Realcordis Hospital is affiliated to Rede D'Or. S√£o Miguel Hospital replaced the former Serv Baby Maternity and Hospital. There is also a unit of UPA 24H (Unidade de Pronto Atendimento 24 Horas - Emergency Service Unit). Nature Realengo still has remnants of rainforest that are home to endangered animals such as the Golden lion tamarin, armadillo, macaw, crowned kinglet, monkey frog, and plants like orchids, bromelias and other flora and fauna. The Parque da Pedra Branca (White Rock Park), the door to the Maci√ßo da Pedra Branca (Massif of White Rock) is found in sub-district Barata. Inaugurated on October 17, 2009 by Governor S√©rgio Cabral Filho, the government spent R$786,000.00 (seven hundred eighty-six reais) in equipment such as water tanks and springs, it also runs a post of Firemen to maintain order in the reserve. History The so-called Terras originated, according to some historians, with the Carta R√©gia (Royal Charter) of June 27, 1814, by which John VI of Portugal, also a prince, gave land grants in the Senate of Rio de Janeiro land situated in Campo Grande (Big Field). These were called realengos, or royal lands, arising because of territorial conquest by the discovery of the country; they were not ordinary real estate. The land grant in what is now the Realengo neighborhood, center and periphery, was intended to serve only for grazing cattle, supplying meat to butchers in the city. These lands were banned from any sale by the disposition requiring that the Senate survey and prepare them to serve the purpose for which they were donated by that charter. The village of Realengo was limited by the Senate of Rio de Janeiro, by the provision of July 18, 1814, taking over the Court of the lands tested on the Estrada da Santa Cruz (Road of Saint Cross) and depths of more than twenty fathoms. Despite the express prohibition of lease, sale or other disposition, the Senate, after a certain time, taking advantage of the charter of June 27 has all land granted for such reasons that in addition to the ordinance November 20, 1815 the Prince Regent known as royal notice, on December 20, 1815 that allowed only the tenure of the party which was tested on the Estrada de Santa Cruz (and depths of 20 fathoms the maximum, not at all Realengo). The neighborhood had its first settlers, slaves and immigrants from the Portuguese island of the Azores, by order of the Prince Regent Dom Jo√£o, later Dom Jo√£o VI. When they devoted themselves to agriculture for grazing leading products such as sugar, molasses, alcohol and rum, the port of Guaratiba. Research shows that there was only one mill in Realengo as everything was taken to undergo transformation into other properties.

The network transmits in both official languages (English and French) from 230 sites across Canada. Weatheradio Canada like their telephone service, uses the Starcaster Text to Speech, which has been used for many years and is owned by STR-SpeechTech Ltd. In most locations, the service broadcasts on one of seven specially-allocated VHF radio frequencies, audible only on dedicated \\"weather band\\" receivers or any VHF radio capable of receiving 10 kHz bandwidth FM signals centered on these assigned channels, which are located within the larger \\"public service band\\". The radio frequencies used by Weatheradio Canada are the same as those used by its American counterpart, NOAA Weather Radio, and receivers designed for use in one country are compatible for use in the other. Since 2004, the service has used Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME) alerting technology to disseminate severe weather bulletins. Weatheradio has indicated that, in the future, it also plans to add other hazard and civil emergency information (such as natural disasters, technological accidents, AMBER alerts and terrorist attacks) to its broadcasts. In some locations, primarily national parks, provincial parks and remote communities with little or no local media service, a transmitter operated by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation carries the service on a standard AM or FM broadcast frequency. As of August 2007, most of these AM and FM transmitters were unlicensed by the CRTC under a special license exemption granted to low-power non-commercial broadcasters.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-280, August 7, 2007.  History  In 1976, Environment Canada Weatheradio's service was launched and expanded to 30 locations in roughly 10 years. In the early-1990s, increased government investment permitted major expansion of the network to the present size of 179 sites. Frequencies Weatheradio Canada signals are transmitted using FM (10 kHz bandwidth), with band spacing of 25 kHz. The service uses these frequencies: *162.400 MHz *162.425 MHz *162.450 MHz *162.475 MHz *162.500 MHz *162.525 MHz *162.550 MHz  Programming  Weather information is broadcast in both official languages which is English first then French. Weather alert broadcasts are inserted within the normal playlist, and are available in both official languages. Marine forecasts are broadcast, though on a limited schedule. Most marine forecasts are broadcast on the marine frequency, which is not available on most weather radios. One requires a special receiver capable of receiving the marine frequency, which varies by province. Environment Canada formerly broadcast a full marine forecast which included marine alerts; this has since changed between 2007 and 2009. Weather broadcasts also include the UV index for the forecasted day, and for the following day during the UV index season. The index runs from 1 (low) to 10 (extreme).

Its major settlements include Cizre and Silopi. The current Governor of the province is Ali Hamza Pehlivan. As of 2013, the province had an estimated population of 475,255 people. Kurdish people are the majority of the province's population. Geography Midin The province borders Siirt Province to the north, Van Province to the northeast, Mardin Province to the west, Batman Province to the northwest, Syria to the southwest, and Iraq to the southeast. ≈ûƒ±rnak Province has some mountainous regions in the west and the south, but the majority of the province consists of plateaus, resulting from the many rivers that cross it. These include the Tigris, and its tributaries Hezil and Kƒ±zƒ±lsu, and also √áaƒülayan. The most important mountains are Mount Cudi (2089 m), Gabar, Namaz and Altƒ±n. ≈ûƒ±rnak is the poorest province of Turkey with an average income of TL 508 per capita. =Districts= ≈ûƒ±rnak province is divided into seven districts (capital district in bold): *Beyt√º≈ü≈üebap *Cizre *G√º√ßl√ºkonak *ƒ∞dil *Silopi *≈ûƒ±rnak *Uludere  History  = Inspectorate-General = In order to Turkefy the local population, in June 1927 the Law 1164 was passed which allowed the creation of Inspectorates-General (Umumi M√ºffeti≈ülik, UM). The province therefore was included in the so-called First Inspectorate General () , which span over the provinces of Hakk√¢ri, Siirt, Van, Mardin, ≈ûƒ±rnak Bitlis, Sanlƒ±urfa, Elaziƒü, and Diyarbakƒ±r. The First Inspectorate General was established on the 1 January 1928 and had its headquarters in Diyarbakƒ±r. The UM was governed by an Inspector General, who governed with a wide-ranging authority over civilian, juridical and military matters. In 1948 the policy of governing the province within the Inspectorate General was left behind and the administration was not re-employed again, but the office of the Inspector General was only dissolved in 1952 during the government of the Democrat Party. = PKK-Turkish conflict = ≈ûƒ±rnak has been a focal point in Turkey's struggle against the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). Turkey's anti-terror operations against the PKK began in 1984. From its creation in 1990 to 2002, ≈ûƒ±rnak Province was part of the OHAL (State of emergency) region which was declared to counter the PKK and governed by a so called Supergovernor who was given additional powers than a normal provincial Governor. He was given the power to relocate and resettle whole villages, settlements and hamlets. In December 1990 with the Decree No. 430, the supergovernor and the provincial governors in the OHAL region received immunity against any legal prosecution in connections with actions they made due to the powers they received with the Decree No. 430.  Turkish Forces' operation, 1992  On 18 August 1992 Turkish forces attacked the city, killing 54 people, mostly children and women.

SCF can exist both as a transmembrane protein and a soluble protein. This cytokine plays an important role in hematopoiesis (formation of blood cells), spermatogenesis, and melanogenesis.  Production  The gene encoding stem cell factor (SCF) is found on the Sl locus in mice and on chromosome 12q22-12q24 in humans. The soluble and transmembrane forms of the protein are formed by alternative splicing of the same RNA transcript, Figure 1: Alternative splicing of the same RNA transcript produces soluble and transmembrane forms of stem cell factor (SCF). The soluble form of SCF contains a proteolytic cleavage site in exon 6. Cleavage at this site allows the extracellular portion of the protein to be released. The transmembrane form of SCF is formed by alternative splicing that excludes exon 6 (Figure 1). Both forms of SCF bind to c-KIT and are biologically active. Soluble and transmembrane SCF is produced by fibroblasts and endothelial cells. Soluble SCF has a molecular weight of 18,5 KDa and forms a dimer. It is detected in normal human blood serum at 3.3 ng/mL.  Role in development  SCF plays an important role in the hematopoiesis during embryonic development. Sites where hematopoiesis takes place, such as the fetal liver and bone marrow, all express SCF. Mice that do not express SCF die in utero from severe anemia. Mice that do not express the receptor for SCF (c-KIT) also die from anemia. SCF may serve as guidance cues that direct hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) to their stem cell niche (the microenvironment in which a stem cell resides), and it plays an important role in HSC maintenance. Non-lethal point mutants on the c-KIT receptor can cause anemia, decreased fertility, and decreased pigmentation. During development, the presence of the SCF also plays an important role in the localization of melanocytes, cells that produce melanin and control pigmentation. In melanogenesis, melanoblasts migrate from the neural crest to their appropriate locations in the epidermis. Melanoblasts express the KIT receptor, and it is believed that SCF guides these cells to their terminal locations. SCF also regulates survival and proliferation of fully differentiated melanocytes in adults. In spermatogenesis, c-KIT is expressed in primordial germ cells, spermatogonia, and in primordial oocytes. It is also expressed in the primordial germ cells of females. SCF is expressed along the pathways that the germ cells use to reach their terminal destination in the body. It is also expressed in the final destinations for these cells. Like for melanoblasts, this helps guide the cells to their appropriate locations in the body.  Role in hematopoiesis  SCF plays a role in the regulation of HSCs in the stem cell niche in the bone marrow. SCF has been shown to increase the survival of HSCs in vitro and contributes to the self-renewal and maintenance of HSCs in- vivo. HSCs at all stages of development express the same levels of the receptor for SCF (c-KIT). The stromal cells that surround HSCs are a component of the stem cell niche, and they release a number of ligands, including SCF. Figure 2: A diagram of a hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) inside its niche. It is adjacent to stromal cells that secrete ligands, such as stem cell factor (SCF). In the bone marrow, HSCs and hematopoietic progenitor cells are adjacent to stromal cells, such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts (Figure 2). These HSCs remain in the niche by adhering to ECM proteins and to the stromal cells themselves. SCF has been shown to increase adhesion and thus may play a large role in ensuring that HSCs remain in the niche. A small percentage of HSCs regularly leave the bone marrow to enter circulation and then return to their niche in the bone marrow. It is believed that concentration gradients of SCF, along with the chemokine SDF-1, allow HSCs to find their way back to the niche. In adult mice, the injection of the ACK2 anti-KIT antibody, which binds to the c-Kit receptor and inactivates it, leads to severe problems in hematopoiesis. It causes a significant decrease in the number HSC and other hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone marrow. This suggests that SCF and c-Kit plays an important role in hematopoietic function in adulthood. SCF also increases the survival of various hematopoietic progenitor cells, such as megakaryocyte progenitors, in vitro. In addition, it works with other cytokines to support the colony growth of BFU-E, CFU-GM, and CFU-GEMM4. Hematopoietic progenitor cells have also been shown to migrate towards a higher concentration gradient of SCF in vitro, which suggests that SCF is involved in chemotaxis for these cells. Fetal HSCs are more sensitive to SCF than HSCs from adults. In fact, fetal HSCs in cell culture are 6 times more sensitive to SCF than adult HSCs based on the concentration that allows maximum survival.  Expression in mast cells  Mast cells are the only terminally differentiated hematopoietic cells that express the c-Kit receptor. Mice with SCF or c-Kit mutations have severe defects in the production of mast cells, having less than 1% of the normal levels of mast cells. Conversely, the injection of SCF increases mast cell numbers near the site of injection by over 100 times. In addition, SCF promotes mast cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and survival. It also promotes the release of histamine and tryptase, which are involved in the allergic response.  Soluble and transmembrane forms  The presence of both soluble and transmembrane SCF is required for normal hematopoietic function. Mice that produce the soluble SCF but not transmembrane SCF suffer from anemia, are sterile, and lack pigmentation. This suggests that transmembrane SCF plays a special role in vivo that is separate from that of soluble SCF.  c-KIT receptor  Figure 3: c-Kit expression in hematopoietic cells SCF binds to the c-KIT receptor (CD 117), a receptor tyrosine kinase. c-Kit is expressed in HSCs, mast cells, melanocytes, and germ cells. It is also expressed in hematopoietic progenitor cells including erythroblasts, myeloblasts, and megakaryocytes. However, with the exception of mast cells, expression decreases as these hematopoietic cells mature and c-KIT is not present when these cells are fully differentiated (Figure 3). SCF binding to c-KIT causes the receptor to homodimerize and auto- phosphorylate at tyrosine residues. The activation of c-Kit leads to the activation of multiple signaling cascades, including the RAS/ERK, PI3-Kinase, Src kinase, and JAK/STAT pathways.  Clinical relevance  SCF may be used along with other cytokines to culture HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors. The expansion of these cells ex-vivo (outside the body) would allow advances in bone marrow transplantation, in which HSCs are transferred to a patient to re- establish blood formation. One of the problems of injecting SCF for therapeutic purposes is that SCF activates mast cells. The injection of SCF has been shown to cause allergic-like symptoms and the proliferation of mast cells and melanocytes. Cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of transmembrane SCF promotes stem cell migration and improves cardiac function and animal survival after myocardial infarction.  Interactions  Stem cell factor has been shown to interact with CD117.

It was directed by Mel Smith and written by Kim Fuller and Georgia Pritchett. Plot The film follows the story of two women living in London, Shannon (Minnie Driver) and Frances (Mary McCormack), attempting to con a group of gangsters, led by Kerrigan (Michael Gambon) and Mason (Kevin McNally), into giving them ¬£1,000,000 after they overhear a conversation between gang members during a local bank heist. The idea is that the money will later be used to purchase a large amount of expensive medical equipment for the hospital where Shannon works as an overworked and underpaid nurse. Frances, a failing American actress who has resorted to doing voice acting for children's cartoons, wants the money so that she can get out of the rut she believes she is stuck in, and also because she wants a Mercedes to replace her aging Pontiac Firebird. Throughout the course of the film, the women threaten the mobsters in order to persuade them to give them a cut of the heist money. As the film progresses, the danger the women are in becomes more obvious, and just as it appears that they are out of their depth - Frances' car is blown up and Shannon is almost kidnapped - they successfully break into Mason's house and confront him and one of his gang. A mass shoot-out occurs after it becomes clear that the girls have stolen all of Mason's guns and have bagged all the money. They manage to get away in the gang members' Porsche Boxster with the bags of money. The hospital equipment is delivered to Shannon's hospital anonymously, as Shannon and Frances look on. They then drive off into London in the Mercedes CLK that they have bought with some of the money, happy that they have done the right thing.

He has represented and captained the South African Schools rugby team (2001), South Africa's under-19 (2002) and under-21 (2004) teams, as well as the Springbok Sevens team (2001). Watson has also captained both the Western Province and the Super Rugby Stormers. He most recently played for the . Watson has been controversial due to his relationship with then-national coach Jake White, political interference in his selection for the 2007 Springbok team, interaction with the squad afterwards, and his comments in a speech. Watson told a public gathering on 3 October 2008 that he had to stop himself from vomiting when he wore the Springbok jersey, and referred to black players such as Zola Yeye who during apartheid had been excluded from national selection. The media suggested that Watson had also denigrated Afrikaner players and rugby officials in a question and answer session, although the transcript of the speech does not bear this out. Consequently, some South African rugby supporters and players (mostly Afrikaners) launched verbal attacks against Watson (often vehement and personal), Afrikaner rights groups like the Afrikanerbond sought his exclusion from rugby, and some spectators vocally expressed their disapproval whenever he played in South Africa. Watson has denied that he is against Afrikaners, pointing out that not only does he oppose all forms of discrimination but that he also has Afrikaner ancestors. He conceded in 2010 that he had been used as \\"a political pawn\\" and that he would have done things differently if he had the chance to do them over. He regretted attending the Springbok training camp in 2007, knowing that neither he, the squad, nor White wanted him to be there. Youth Luke Watson is the son of anti-apartheid activist Daniel \\"Cheeky\\" Watson, who was also a rugby player of national standard in his youth. Watson comes from a family traditionally strongly committed to Christianity. His grandfather, Daniel John Watson, was a Pentecostal lay preacher and transmitted Christian values to Luke's father while Cheeky was growing up in Grahamstown. Luke Watson has openly admitted to being a committed Christian who wanted to become a minister at the age of 17, and who believes that doing God's work is to help those on the margins. He sports four religious tattoos on his body, including a cross on his right biceps and the reference \\"Habakkuk 3:17\\" on his left arm. While living in Cape Town he fed homeless persons three times a week and let them shower at his home. Watson says that he prays continuously while on the field, asking God \\" 'where the gaps are, where the weaknesses are in defence and help me be in the right place' \\". Yet he does not believe in being judgmental, and describes himself as \\" 'very tentative to preach too quickly' \\". =School years= While attending Grey Junior School in Port Elizabeth Luke realized, at the age of 7, that because they associated with blacks and had supported the anti-apartheid struggle, his family was different from other white South Africans. His father had joined the African National Congress in 1978 and had helped to hide cadres from the secret police, who burnt down his home in 1986 as well as his business. Luke Watson was ostracized by other students and someone wrote \\"Kill the Watsons\\" on his desk. When his father was imprisoned his mother, Tracey, hid this from him. He learnt about racism and apartheid from his father, and wanted to represent the change that his father had worked for. Watson played rugby at Grey High School where he was coached from Grade 10 onwards by Mike Howe. Howe first switched Watson from eighthman to openside flank. Later Howe favourably remembered Watson's ball-fetching skills from rucks and his motivational abilities, but said that at the time his organisational skills \\"let him down\\". In Grade 12 Watson captained Grey High's First XV. He organized a strike of the team after objections were raised that he had abused his position as captain. During his final year of high school Watson told his principal, Roy Simpson, that he was resigning as prefect. Some claim that Watson's resignation was due to his loyalty to \\"the wrong crowd\\", while his father maintained it was because the younger Watson had objected to \\"autocratic leadership\\" at the school. Despite his actions, Watson was given the Headmaster's Leadership award that year. With his cousin, Daniel, Luke Watson represented the Eastern Province XV at the 2000 Craven Week. Aged 16, he scored a try in their 21-all draw against Griqualand-West, and was in the Eastern Province schools team that played in a curtain raiser for the test between South Africa and Canada on 10 June. In July 2001 he was back at the Craven Week where he impressed in Eastern Province's 15‚Äì17 loss against a Blue Bulls side. =National selection= Watson was selected for the South African AcademyUntil about 2008 Academy sides were selected from provincial academy teams that participated in the annual Craven Week rugby festival for under-18 players. Provinces first sent Academy teams to four regional Academy Weeks, where four Academy sides were chosen to attend Craven Week. As part of the then-South African Rugby Football Union's development programme, academy teams contained quotas of players of colour. For example, by 1999 a minimum of 13 players of colour had to be included in each 22-person side. Essentially representing a South African Schools B-side, SA Academy teams also beat SA Schools sides in 2004, 2005 and 2008. side in 2000 that beat the South African Schools side that year. He was invited to a training camp in March 2001 but was not selected for the national under-19 team that participated in the Junior World Championship in Santiago, Chile. In 2001 Watson was chosen as captain of the South African Schools team that played the French under-18 team twice. The SA Schools side, which included Bismarck du Plessis and Derick Hougaard won the first match in Cape Town 36‚Äì15. In the second clash at Loftus Versfeld, which was drawn 23‚Äì23, Watson \\"played well\\" and scored a try. In October 2001 he was one of five nominees for the Craven Week Player of the Tournament, which was awarded to Derick Hougaard. In 2002 Watson was chosen to captain South Africa's under-19 team at the IRB Junior World Championship in Italy. The team had three weeks to prepare and beat Chili (48‚Äì3) in their first game and England (17‚Äì8) on their way to a semifinal in Milan which they lost 41‚Äì9 to New Zealand, the eventual champions. The IRB commended Watson for representing the spirit of the competition in being well-spoken and without pretense. Watson told a reporter that it was an honour to be part of Springbok history. He added, \\"for my Dad, Cheeky Watson, it is a dream come true. He is very proud that his son plays for a unified South African team\\". Watson was selected for the South African Sevens team that played at the 2002 Commonwealth Games, replacing Marius Schoeman who withdrew due to a broken arm. Coached by Chester Williams and managed by Rob Louw, the team placed third. Watson and teammate Jean de Villiers impressed former England international Matt Dawson as potential future Springboks for the 15-aside format. Despite speculation that he would be selected for the Springbok squad in 2003, national coach Rudolf Straeuli overlooked Watson for tests against Scotland and Australia. The national selectors did include him in the South African A-team that faced Argentina A at Wellington on 25 June. Watson was selected in 2004 to represent South Africa in the IRB's Under 21 Rugby World Championship in a team that included Andries Bekker, Bryan Habana and Wynand Olivier. Coached by Peter de Villiers, the team beat Australia 44‚Äì10 to finish third. Watson later credited former Springbok and national coach Michael du Plessis as the person (apart from his father) who had the greatest influence on his playing abilities early on. His parents asked Du Plessis to help develop a teenage Watson in Port Elizabeth. A reporter claimed that \\"within two seconds\\" Du Plessis taught young Watson \\"more about running lines than other coaches could do in two years\\". Early senior career =Eastern Province Elephants, 2002= In 2002 Watson was included in the Eastern Province under-21 team before progressing to the senior squad. During round one of the Currie CupAt the time the Currie Cup was divided into two sections in which teams played two rounds. The top four teams in each section after a first round of six matches progressed to the Top Eight, which competed for the Currie Cup in 7 games. The bottom three teams after round one then played 5 matches for the Bankfin Cup. Watson was included in the Elephants' first match against the Pumas on 20 July after impressing coach Allister Coetzee with his speed and work rate in the warm-up game against Boland. Watson played alongside experienced players like Paul Treu, who had already represented the Emerging Springboks, and Barry Pinnock, who had played more than 150 times for Eastern Province. Despite having won seven consecutive games prior to the 2002 season, the Elephants lost all but one of their 6 first-round games. In one of these, against the SWD Eagles on 24 August, Watson was \\"involved in too many incidents off the ball to be of much value to his team\\". He scored his \\"first try at senior level\\" in the match against the Leopards on 7 September. Watson was included in the team that pulled off an unlikely round one victory against unbeaten log leaders the Bulls on 14 September. The Elephants fared better in the second round of the Bankfin Cup, the bottom division of the Currie Cup, with Watson scoring a try in their come-from-behind 41‚Äì35 win against Boland. But he had to withdraw from the semi-final after sustaining a serious lower back injury against the Griffons on 5 October. The Elephants lost the semifinal against Border, so finishing in third place with 3 wins of 5 games played. By the end of the 2002 season Watson was called \\"promising\\" and \\"one of the most exciting young ball fetchers in the country\\", and by November he was being actively sought by the Durban-based Sharks. Watson revealed that while he would have preferred to stay with Eastern Province, they had offered him a small contract which had not yet been confirmed. He felt that Eastern Province's reluctance was due to his father having stood against and narrowly lost to George Davids for election as president of the Eastern Province Rugby Football Union. =Sharks, 2003‚Äì04= Watson relocated to Durban in 2003 where he represented the Sharks in the Currie Cup and the in the Super 12 competitions. By June 2003 he had signed up with rugby agent Jason Smith's World Artists, who represented South African players such as Victor Matfield and Clyde Rathbone locally and abroad.Watson seems to have had a contract with rugby agent Craig Livingstone at some time. Cheeky Watson reportedly said in 2007 that the termination of Luke's contract with Livingstone had been handled by Bierbuyck, but did not say when this happened. Sharks Coach Kevin Putt included Watson in the team that won 32‚Äì19 against a weakened Harlequins at the Stoop in London on 2 February. At the start of the Super 12 season Watson was hailed by Sharks fitness coach Kevin Stevenson as the fittest among the Shark forwards while also able to bench-press \\"1.6 times his body weight\\" and complete 29 pull-ups. He made the squad for what would have been his Super 12 debut on 21 February against a Stormers side that included \\"two of the best fetchers in South Africa, Corn√© Krige en Hendrik Gerber\\". But Watson did not play in the game, as his inclusion had been part of Putt's failed ruse to mislead his opponents. Watson made his actual Super 12 debut came against the Brumbies, at 19 the youngest player in the Super 12 that year. His direct opponent was flank George Smith, regarded as \\"one of the best fetchers in the world\\". Smith had been Watson's hero while he was a schoolboy at Grey. Watson's performance was excellent, according to Putt, who claimed that he and forwards coach John Allan had only recently taught Watson the finer arts of being a fetcher. During the Super 12 season \\"the exciting\\" Watson was commended for combining \\"a high tackle count with good skills\\" while producing \\"sparkling tries\\", as he did in the Sharks' 35‚Äì20 loss to the Hurricanes in March. There were some concerns about his \\"lack of bulk\\", despite his \\"gutsy\\" performances. A hamstring injury and a bruised hip early in March caused Watson to miss Super rugby matches against the Highlanders and the Cats respectively. His rival for the open-side flank position, Roland Bernard, was selected instead for the game against the Chiefs. On his return to the team Watson won the man of the match award in the Sharks' 18‚Äì23 defeat to the Crusaders in Christchurch on 12 April. He retained his place for the match against the Bulls on 10 May, which his team lost 16‚Äì24. The Sharks ended a miserable and injury-plagued Super 12 season in 11th place with only 3 wins. The 2003 Currie Cup season started badly for Watson, who had contracted tick- bite fever and was forced to miss the Sharks' first warm-up game in July. He was replaced by Solly Tyibilika, newly arrived in Durban from the . Watson then injured his leg, and Tyibilika retained his place for subsequent games against the Eagles and Griquas. During the season Watson was switched from flank to eighthman five times, anticipating where coaches would use him later at the Stormers and Bath. In the Currie Cup final against the Bulls which the Sharks lost 19‚Äì40, Watson replaced Brad McLeod-Henderson in the 54-minute of the match. He was not nominated for any category in the end-of-season awards, despite a reporter calling him \\"the country's top rookie loose-forward\\". Watson's good form during the 2004 Super 12 season made him a recruiting target for professional teams. While he was still under contract to the Sharks, his terms were to expire at the end of 2004. During the Currie Cup season Watson was rumored to be seeking to represent the Stormers in the 2005 Super 12 season, and by 30 August the Stormers had offered him a contract. On 14 September Watson publicly announced that he had signed with the Stormers, despite efforts by the Sharks' management to retain his services. Watson expected to play out the remainder of his Sharks contract in the Currie Cup until the Stormers' started their Super rugby training in December 2004. Instead, he was released on the same day as he made his announcement. Both Sharks CEO Brian van Zyl and coach Kevin Putt indicated that they preferred to work with players who had a long-term commitment to the team. Watson was left without a professional home base for the remaining three months of the Currie Cup season. He spent the time with his parents in Port Elizabeth to recuperate from injuries and prepare for upcoming season. Meanwhile, he joined local club SK Walmers which had strong ties to the black community and his family. =Western Province, 2005= In 2005 Watson moved to Cape Town where he played for both the Western Province Currie Cup and Stormers Super rugby sides. His home club was Schotsekloof Walmers Rugby Football Club. Coach Gert Smal included Watson in his Super 12 training camp at Somerset-West in January, and in the team for their warm-up games against Boland and Welsh side Gwent Dragons. Watson made his Super 12 debut for the Stormers against his old team, the Sharks, on 25 February. He dismissed suggestions that his unhappy departure from the Natal team would cause unlawful play on either side. Ahead of the game, the media made much of the \\"dream combination\\" of Watson, Burger, and Joe van Niekerk. Watson and Burger agreed before the match to take turns to act as fetcher, depending on who was on the open side of the playing field at scrums. Watson had looked forward to playing with Burger and Van Niekerk, who he described as \\" 'quality players from whom I will learn a lot' \\". Watson's perceived lineout weakness was a factor when Smal replaced him with the 197 cm tall Adri Badenhorst for the 19 March game against the Waratahs in Sydney. Ironically, Watson replaced Badenhorst in the 67th minute of the game. Despite being restricted to his hotel room during the week by Smal due to signs of flu, Watson played in the Stormers' 9‚Äì12 loss to the Hurricanes in their next game. Due to injuries Watson, Burger, and Van Niekerk would not play together again before the game against the Chiefs on 30 April. Throughout the season rugby journalists commented positively on Watson's performance, particularly his \\"excellent fetching skills\\". One said that at times his playing \\"set the field alight\\", although another lamented that he lacked Burger's physical abilities. The Stormers ended the season at 9th place with 3 wins and one drawn game, 27 points behind log leaders Crusaders. A shoulder injury prevented Watson from playing in Western Province's first warm-up game of the Currie Cup season against the Lions on 11 June. He was one of 17 regulars who were unavailable for Province at the time because of Springbok squad duties or injuries. But he recovered sufficiently to play in the second warm-up match against the French Barbarians on 16 June. Because he had been used in this position by the Sharks, Province coach Kobus van der Merwe temporarily switched Watson to eighthman for Province's opening Currie Cup match against the Cheetahs on 24 June. He was back at flank when he scored a try in the next game against the Griffons on 1 July. He missed the game against the Leopards because of flu, and was relegated to the substitutes' bench for the following one against the Bulldogs. David Hendricks took his place for both matches. Watson regained his place and scored two tries in the 42‚Äì16 victory over Griquas on 29 July. He did not play in Western Province's 11‚Äì16 semi-final Currie Cup loss to the Cheetahs. Controversies =Relationship with former national coach Jake White, 2002‚Äì07= In 2003 coach Jake White chose Schalk Burger and omitted Watson for the South African under-21 team that won the world championship. White suggested that Watson switch to hooker instead where he could reach the highest echelons, as Watson did not have the requisite attributes to be a first-class flank. White's suggestions may have been prompted by his own experience, when as a youth player he had to switch from flank to hooker because he was too short. White reportedly insisted that \\"Watson would never make a side he coached\\". By 2004 White was said to be against picking Burger and Watson in the same team, Although he had had shown \\"sensational form\\" in 2004, Watson was again ignored by White and selectors Andre Markgraaff and Pieter Jooste in favour of Solly Tyibilika, who had lost his position to Watson at the Sharks during the season. Some believe that White's preference for Burger motivated Watson's 2005 move to Cape Town, where he could prove himself against Burger in the Western Province team. Non-selection for Springboks, 2006 Watson showed such good form in the 2006 Super 14 competition that he received that year's Vodacom Super Rugby Player of the Tournament award. According to statistics compiled by the New Zealand company Verusco, Watson was the second best openside flanker in the 2006 Super 14 competition, preceded only by Richie McCaw and followed by Phil Waugh. Despite Watson's form during that season, national coach Jake White again preferred 2004 IRB Player of the Year Burger over Watson, this time for the No. 6 position in the Springbok squad. At the time White stated that Watson offered limited options, and that South Africa had many quality loose forwards who offer more. White said in 2009 of Watson: \\"I don't think he's a good rugby player. He is a most overrated player\\". By contrast McCaw described Watson in 2006 as \\"an excellent player\\" and \\"perhaps...unlucky not to be part of the Springbok set-up\\". White repeatedly emphasised the need for tall loose-forwards who could add extra line-out options. Similar sentiments regarding stature, while not aimed at Watson specifically, had been expressed by other rugby pundits. Italy coach and former Springbok coach Nick Mallett has been a supporter of Watson. When asked in 2008 why in his opinion the Springboks won the 2007 World Cup, Mallett told an audience that the reason the Springboks won was because Schalk Burger is the smallest player in the Springboks' forward pack. Schalk Burger is 1,93m tall, while Watson is 1,84m. And in March 2008 SA Rugby Magazine quoted newly appointed Springbok coach Peter de Villiers as saying: \\"A small talented guy will always be better than a big untalented guy, and a big talented guy is better than a small talented guy. I will select the best player for the job\\". After Jake White's preferred selections won the 2007 World Cup, England line-out specialist Ben Kay was quoted as saying: \\"Their line-out was fantastic and was a major difference between the two teams. They have been the best line-out in the world for many years and gave us enormous problems.\\" White's public stance against shorter loose forwards was contradicted in November 2006 when he included Kabamba Floors for the Springbok squad against England in the place of an injured Pierre Spies. At 1.75m Floors is 9 cm shorter than Watson. White admitted at the time that his view that Floors also was too short had been incorrect. SARU president Oregan Hoskins, certain journalists and Watson himself at the time accused White of personal bias. For them, Watson's non-selection was due partly to the fact that his father Daniel \\"Cheeky\\" Watson was a former anti-apartheid activist, who alienated himself from the SA Rugby establishment by playing club rugby in the 'black' townships of Eastern Province at a time when this was illegal in terms of racist apartheid legislation. Watson claimed that Mike Howe, one of his coaches at Grey High School, had told him while he was still a student there that White had made derogatory comments about Watson. Cheeky Watson suggested that Howe had influenced White against Luke ‚Äì a charge Howe denies. The elder Watson said that White, while the coach of the Under-21 national team, had told a South African Rugby Football Union before witnesses that he would not select Luke \\" 'because he would come with his father's baggage' \\". Hoskins explained that he interfered in Watson's 2007 selection because \\"the relationship between the two was extremely strained for a very long time. It had gone past the breaking point and I felt the player was being prejudiced\\". White dismissed the charge of bias in 2006, claiming that his reasons were purely rugby-related and that he had \\"no personal issues with anybody\\". SA Sports Illustrated interview, 2006 Apart from his objections to what he perceived as Watson's limited skills and lack of stature, White implied that Watson was not a team player, and would have been a divisive influence on the Springbok team if selected. White's accusation that Watson was divisive was no doubt supported by Watson's public criticism of Jake White in a 2006 SA Sports Illustrated article. Watson accused White of a \\"lack of integrity\\", as White had \\"attacked Schalk Brits\\" for wanting to play professionally in England, yet he himself had \\"tried to hold SA Rugby to ransom with an overseas offer\\". Watson also questioned the credentials of captain John Smit and he said there was no longer any pride and passion in the Springbok squad. Watson reportedly said: \\"Obviously I would love to play for the Springboks, but I do not want to find myself in a position where I'm compromising my beliefs in equality, integrity and honour to achieve that goal.\\" Watson's comments in the 2006 SA Sports Illustrated interview revealed his own negative feeling at the time towards White, captain John Smit and the squad. When Watson was finally selected as a Springbok in 2007 and was asked in media interviews to comment on his earlier public criticisms, he maintained that he stood by what he had said a year earlier. Watson's comments raised concerns that he could be charged by SARU for \\"bringing the game into disrepute\\", a broadly defined transgression that can be used to sanction players and officials who make negative public statements. For example, in 2000 then-national coach Nick Mallett was charged for publicly criticising SARU for \\"greed\\" in inflating Test match ticket prices. White himself had been threatened with sanctions for breaching this regulation. No action was apparently taken by SARU against Watson for bringing the game into disrepute, nor any explanation provided why it had not done so. Springboks or officials are not always charged for making negative public comments about teammates. Smit was not sanctioned for his \\"cancerous effect\\" comments about Watson, for example. \\"Bringing the game into disrepute\\" is so broadly defined that it has been used to remove players or officials that have fallen into disfavour. The Independent's correspondent suggested that such an internal settling of scores had happened to Mallet. By reaffirming his 2006 position after his 2007 selection, Watson may have breached the Springbok code of conduct according to which a player undertakes not to discredit or insult a Springbok teammate. But a player makes this commitment to the code when senior teammates initiate new Springboks after their debut game, and Watson's teammates had refused to initiate him. Resolution In October 2008 White was said to have reconciled with Watson by shaking hands with him at a service of the Hillsong Church in Cape Town that both then attended. White was quoted as saying \\" 'I feel sorry for Luke...and it is not for me to judge him\\". White's actions were ascribed to his conversion to Christianity. =SA Rugby Players' Association's 2006 player of the year award= Due to his good form in 2006, Watson was nominated for awards as the Players' Player of the Year, Super 14 Player of the Year, and Currie Cup Player of the Year. Rugby journalist Mark Keohane reported that on the morning of Monday 30 October 2006 Watson had been confirmed as the winner. But the decision was overturned later the same day and awarded to Free State loose forward Kabamba Floors. Players' Association chair Piet Heymans said that Floors had won by 8 votes when voting closed at 5pm on Monday. Heymans' assertion was placed in doubt when SARU revealed that the vote had actually been tied, and that SARU president Oregan Hoskins had cast the deciding vote in favour of Floors to break the deadlock. Keohane questioned why SARU's leadership became involved in what was the voting prerogative of players. He alleged that White and Hoskins had intervened when it appeared that Watson would win, and that in this context the Players' Association had demanded a recount. Keohane suggested that a joint award would have had precedent in that the Currie Cup had been shared among teams who were tied at the end of the season. =Politicised Springbok selection, 2007= In May 2007 White and selectors Pieter Jooste and Ian Macintosh, the former national coach, submitted a list of 45 players to the South African Rugby Union for the Springbok training squad. After White's list was submitted, Watson was added to the list without Jake White's knowledge by SARU President Hoskins, fellow SARU executive council member Koos Basson, and Springbok team manager Zola Yeye ‚Äì a long-time friend of the Watson family. Hoskins later said in an interview with Talk Radio 702 host John Robbie that he had added Watson because Watson was South Africa's 2006 Super 14 Player of the Year. Politicians such as Butana Komphela, ANC chairman of the parliamentary sports portfolio committee, and the then-Western Cape Premier Ebrahim Rasool, also insisted on Watson's inclusion. Rasool went so far as to say that Watson should be regarded as a \\"black player\\" based on his father's anti-apartheid contribution, and that he should therefore be included in the Springbok team ahead of \\"white players of equal talent\\". Jake White considered legal action if the SARU executive interfered further with his final team selection. However, White eventually accepted SARU's decision to include Watson in the Springboks. The senior players then refused to include him in the traditional initiation ceremony for newly capped players, due to the nepotistic manner of his selection. In his autobiography In Black and White ‚Äì The Jake White Story, White mentions that he was approached at the start of the 2007 international season by lawyer Brian Biebuyck on behalf of the Watson family. Biebuyck, who was also White's lawyer at the time, passed a nine-point proposal to White. These included the selection of Watson in the World Cup squad; in return, White's contract with SA Rugby would be extended beyond the 2007 World Cup. Failure to select Luke Watson would result in him losing his job before the World Cup. White claims that the Watsons subsequently backed down. Luke's father, Cheeky Watson, has denied these claims. Watson made his controversial Springbok debut against Manu Samoa on 9 June 2007 but made little impression, and was substituted early in the second half after sustaining a rib injury. Watson's father has since told South African newspapers that Luke never wanted to play for the Springboks under White. Watson Snr also boycotted his son's capping ceremony, apparently in protest against White's attitude towards his son. An unknown media source criticized Watson for being \\"hypocritical in taking up his forced selection\\" against Samoa, given his public opinions about White and Smit. The nature of the relationship between Watson and his teammates for the test against Samoa can be gauged from reports that the senior Springboks \\"had refused to initiate him into the squad\\", saying that Yeye, Stofile, and Hoskins should do it instead. As part of his forced selection Watson was included in the tour to Australia and New Zealand for the away leg of the Tri-Nations series, as White rested many of his first-choice players. Watson withdrew from the tour pleading a rib injury which was estimated to need about 10 days to heal. But Watson turned out for Western Province in the Currie Cup on the same day as the first of the Tri-Nations matches. Convener of Springbok selectors Jooste expressed surprise at how quickly Watson had recovered. Andy Marinos, SARU's manager of national teams, cleared Watson to play for his province, saying that uncertainty about the length of Watson's recovery time had prompted the national selectors to omit him. Watson had been assessed by the provincial team doctor and passed a fitness test. Watson was dropped from the national squad, and did not take part in the World Cup. Injured for most of the season, he hardly featured in the 2007 Currie Cup. After the non-selection controversy of 2006 and the politicised-selection controversy of 2007, Watson was firmly established in the media spotlight, and aspects of his behaviour now became subject to more media scrutiny than for other players. =Stormers captaincy, 2007= The coach of the Stormers team in 2007, Kobus van der Merwe, appointed Watson as captain for their Super Rugby campaign. The relationship between coach and captain was not always straightforward. For example, Van der Merwe substituted Watson after 60 minutes of a Super 14 match in April 2007 while the Stormers were being heavily defeated by the Blue Bulls. Watson appeared confused while being substituted, and did not attend the post-match press conference. The following day Watson was still in the dark as to why he was substituted. Van der Merwe first said that he wanted to try a new combination as the match was already lost, but later told Watson that he wanted to rest him. According to some reporters the player and coach clashed in the dressing room after the match, but Watson denied that he and Van der Merwe had problems. In December 2007 new Stormers coach Rassie Erasmus replaced Watson with Springbok backline veteran Jean de Villiers as captain of the Stormers. Watson retained his place in the Stormers' team. Some commentators suggested that one reason why Watson was relieved of the captaincy was that his leadership skills had been criticized by various senior players. Earlier rumors in the press had suggested that Burger would replace Watson as captain for the 2008 Super 14 tournament. Reportedly the original decision was revisited after Erasmus met with Luke's father, Dan Watson, to discuss \\"the role that he [Luke Watson] should play in the Stormers' side\\". Dan Watson allegedly said \\"that he had no problem with Luke not captaining the side, provided Schalk Burger did not have a higher profile\\" than Luke. Erasmus was said to be concerned that Burger, despite his star status, should not be treated differently from his teammates. Previously Erasmus had opined that a good leader does not polarize opinion, and does not make waves or headlines. Just hours after being officially relieved of the Stormers captaincy Watson breached the terms of the team's Adidas sponsorship contract by wearing rival Nike logos at an official training session. The matter was dealt with internally. Despite his sacking as captain, Watson scored most tries (5) for the Stormers in the 2007 Super rugby season, only the second forward after Bobby Skinstad to achieve this accomplishment between 1998 and 2011. In September 2008 Watson was also replaced by De Villiers as captain of the Western Province side under coach Allister Coetzee. Watson had been appointed Western Province captain on 1 June 2006, and had occupied the position 33 times by 14 June 2009. =Speech at Ubumbo rugby festival, 2008= On 3 October 2008 Watson delivered a speech at the Ubumbo rugby festival at the University of Cape Town. He spoke about his family's political record, and described wearing the Springbok jersey as \\"a burden\\" and said he had to struggle \\"to keep myself from vomiting on it.\\" Watson said that his Springbok teammates refused to associate with him after his forced inclusion in the team in 2007. Although Watson gave no context to his comments, some have inferred that he was referring to the controversy over the retention of the Springbok emblem for national sports teams. In a question and answer session after the speech Watson allegedly stated that he hated losing his place in the Bok team to an Afrikaner (Schalk Burger, a former IRB Player of the Year). He also allegedly quoted his father as saying that the rugby administration was \\"rotten to the core\\" and run by \\"Dutchmen.\\" Afrikaners associate the term with pejorative attitudes towards them by British colonists and their descendants, connoting lack of intelligence and low breeding. No reference to Burger or to \\"Dutchmen\\" occur in the transcript of his speech. Watson's words completely contradicted sentiments that he had expressed in his 2006 interview with SA Sports Illustrated magazine, when he had said: \\"It (the Springbok emblem) has the potential and it has the ability to become one of the most powerful emblems this world has seen. ‚Ä¶ It stands for equality. It stands for unity. It stands for a once divided nation that now stands together. It stands for everything this world doesn't have, and everything this world wants\\". Watson added that \\"Playing for the Boks would be a great honour\\" and that \\"Obviously I would love to play for the Springboks\\". Rugby journalist Gavin Rich speculated that Watson's change of heart between 2006 and 2008 was due to his experiences as \\"the unwanted Player No 46\\". Rich felt that Watson was fighting a battle on behalf of others, and expressed \\"sorrow that we may never get to see the real Luke Watson, only the one that has been created in his father's image\\". Journalist Andrew Austin summed up the reactions to the speech by noting how in general terms Watson's story reveals ongoing divides between Afrikaans- and English-speaking South Africans, as well as between those designated \\"whites\\" and \\"blacks\\". The ANC's parliamentary sports committee chair, Butana Khompela, on 9 October seized on the event to demand the replacement of the Springbok. Soon after the contents of the speech was made public the Pro-Afrikaans Action Group condemned Watson's comments as hate-speech, while the civil rights group AfriForum considered pressing charges against him on the same grounds. A number of senior players reportedly threatened to boycott the 2008 end of year tour to England, Wales and Scotland if Watson was included in the squad. But Andy Marinos, then acting managing director of SARU, dismissed the reports as \\"speculation\\" and said that they were \\"utterly groundless\\". When Watson made his first playing appearance after the incident, in a friendly warm-up match against English club Saracens at Newlands in January 2009, he was repeatedly booed by his home crowd. This treatment continued for at least three games into the Super 14 tournament and reached a climax in the Stormers fixture against the Blue Bulls at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria. Watson's detractors branded him \\"Luke the Puke\\" on various social media sites on the internet. The head of SARU's legal affairs department, Christo Ferreira, commented in public media that Watson could be charged of breach of SARU's code of conduct and fined, suspended or warned if found guilty. SARU appointed lawyer Dekker Govender to conduct a preliminary investigation into the incident. On 14 October 2008 the Ubombo Rugby wrote in a letter to Govender that Watson had not said anything that was racist or defamatory. Watson eventually appeared before a disciplinary hearing, which was abandoned on a technical legal matter, and SARU decided to drop the matter entirely. Later senior career =Further international selection, 2008‚Äì09= Following the appointment in January 2008 of Peter de Villiers as the new coach of the Springbok rugby team, Watson was selected for nine more Test caps. Critics continued to question his performance at test level throughout the year with comments that his performances were \\"ordinary\\" and \\"anonymous\\". Eventually De Villiers relegated Watson to a substitute role, and reverted instead to the flankers whom Jake White had been criticised for preferring to Watson, namely Schalk Burger and Juan Smith. Even as a substitute Watson made no impact, and a number of journalists criticized him for not living up to expectations on the field. Two said, \\"Like a dirty smell, he has tended to hang around in this year's [TriNations] tournament.\\" As in 2007, Watson's teammates were less than flattering in their assessment of his 2008 contributions to the national team. John Smit, Watson's Springbok captain, said in his autobiography (The Captain in the Cauldron) that Watson was referred to as the \\" ' \\"cancer\\" of the team' \\" and was the primary reason for the Springboks' poor performances in the 2008 TriNations tournament. Springbok vice-captain Victor Matfield said that during his stand-in captaincy in 2008 \\"I did my best to involve Luke in all the activities\\". He had invited Watson to contribute but Watson \\"didn't want to\\". Matfield also stated, \\"It is untrue that the other players didn't try to accept him. It is rather a case of Luke never wanting to be part of the Springbok set-up.\\" Matfield revealed that many players had complained about Watson. Watson dismissed the claims after the publication of Smit's autobiography in 2009, saying that it was not possible for one player to so badly affect a 40-member squad. While acknowledging that Smit had done \\" 'incredibly well with South Africa' \\" he concluded that Smit's statements were \\" 'a cop-out' \\". On 24 October 2008, the day before the announcement of the Bok squad to tour Europe, Watson declared himself unavailable for selection. His form at the time was considered so poor that he stood little chance of making the squad on merit. =Super Rugby season, 2009= Watson had a better season in the 2009 Super 14, and speculation arose again that he might be selected to face the British and Irish Lions. Former Springbok captain Corn√© Krige said in April 2009 that Watson was playing \\"unbelievable rugby\\" and that he would pick him on form as \\" 'among the best fetchers in the Super 14' \\", but not at eighthman. When a Springbok squad was named in May 2009 to face a Namibian team in a warm-up for the Lions tour, Watson was omitted. According to then-Springbok coach De Villiers, Watson was not selected because he was neither the best nor the second best player in his position (8th Man). Stephen Jones, a rugby correspondent for The Times who was following the Lions tour, described Watson as \\"nothing more than a Currie Cup player\\" and as a \\"second or third choice\\" for a Guinness Premiership club. Jones also described father Cheeky Watson as \\"just another version of a pushy parent\\". Watson shone in the 2009 Currie Cup in the absence of the Springboks, and won the \\"Currie Cup Player of the Year\\" award. =Bath Rugby career, 2009‚Äì11= Watson left South Africa to join Bath Rugby in November 2009, when the club was lying 11th of the 12 teams in the Guinness Premiership table after losing key players to drug controversy during the June 2009 off-season. Coming off the bench on his debut for Bath in November 2009, Watson scored a decisive try against the Ospreys.https://www.planetrugby.com/winning-bath-debut-for-watson/ In contrast to Jones' predictions, Watson became one of the outstanding players of the 2009‚Äì10 Guinness Premiership. During December 2009 he won the Man of the Match award for his performance against Edinburgh. Bath ended 4th in the 2009‚Äì10 Premiership. Despite this, Jones refused to retract his earlier statement, perhaps due to the dislike he formed for Watson on the Lions Tour. At the start of the 2010‚Äì11 season Watson earned the captaincy of his premiership club, replacing fellow South African Michael Claassens who had declined to occupy the position for a second season. He suffered a neck injury that required him to spend the night in hospital, while a \\"ridiculously niggly foot injury\\" sustained against Harlequins in October 2010 sidelined Watson for two months. Despite playing with some discomfort, Watson returned to premiership rugby when he led his side to a win against London Irish on 1 January 2011. Watson was nominated for the 2011 Gatorade Performance of the Season Award for his contribution to Bath's game against Leicester Tigers on 23 October 2010. By December 2010 Watson had played 29 games in all and scored three tries for Bath. Facing none of the controversy that surrounded him in South Africa, Watson's play was hailed as \\"inspirational\\" by Bath's head coach, Steve Meehan. Meehan also noted Watson's popularity off the field. =Eastern Province Kings, 2011‚Äì= Watson announced in December 2010 that he would leave Bath Rugby to join the , the South African provincial side based in Watson's former home town, Port Elizabeth and the team where he started his career in 2002 when they were known as the . The Kings won the 2010 Currie Cup First Division just before Watson signed and were the base union of the Southern Kings, a Super Rugby franchise that would represent South Africa as the South African Kings in the IRB Nations Cup in Romania in June 2011 and play Super Rugby in 2013. He said that the \\"decision to leave Bath Rugby was the hardest of my life\\", but dismissed claims that his move was influenced by his father Cheeky's position as president of the Eastern Province Rugby Union. Instead, he credited Southern Kings' coach Alan Solomons (assistant Springbok coach under Mallett) for his decision. Watson's move coincided with his signing in May 2011 as the first client of Shane Keohane's new sports management agency, which is part of Highbury Safika Media. Highbury's Chief Operating Officer at the time was Mark Keohane and the company publishes SA Rugby magazine. On the playing field, his first appearances for the side came during the 2011 IRB Nations Cup, as the team ‚Äì playing as the South African Kings ‚Äì won all three matches to win the competition. Watson played in their 31‚Äì17 victory over and their 27‚Äì23 victory over . In domestic action, he started in nine of the ' matches during the 2011 Currie Cup First Division season, scoring seven tries ‚Äì the joint-highest by a forward in the competition ‚Äì including two tries in their match against the as the Kings finished second on the log and losing 43‚Äì12 to table-toppers in the final. Watson was available for the title run- in, however, sustaining a knock to the head in training prior to their semi- final match against the , ruling him out of the semi-finals and final with concussion. He sustained a shoulder injury in the build-up to the 2012 season which ruled him out of the entire 2012 Vodacom Cup competition. He returned to action in the 2012 Currie Cup First Division in July 2012. Despite being restricted to just seven starts, Watson scored 13 tries during the Kings' campaign. He scored hat-tricks in their matches against the and the and two tries in each of their matches against the , and the . He missed three rounds of the competition with a rib injury and suffered a broken ankle in their semi-final match against the . Despite his absence, the Kings won the final of the competition, beating the 26‚Äì25 in Port Elizabeth, but failed to gain promotion to the Premier Division, losing to the in a two-legged promotion/relegation play-off. Watson was named captain of the Super Rugby squad for their inaugural season in the competition in 2013. He played in their first ever game ‚Äì a 22‚Äì10 victory over the in Port Elizabeth ‚Äì but suffered a throat injury in the 32nd minute, was substituted off and subsequently missed their next six matches. He returned to the starting line- up for the home match against the , but looked unfit and had a poor game. He started the next two matches against the and the from the substitutes' bench before returning to the starting line-up for the matches against the ‚Äì where he scored two tries in a 34‚Äì27 victory ‚Äì and the . He was ruled out of the match with flu and then suffered an ankle fracture that ruled him out of the remainder of the season. He finally returned to action in August 2014 after more than a year out. Due to the Currie Cup's expansion from six to eight teams, the found themselves in the Premier Division of the competition after a long absence. Watson played in two matches for the Kings ‚Äì a 16‚Äì35 opening day defeat to former side , during which Watson took just 33 minutes to score his first try for the EP Kings after injury and a 30‚Äì25 loss to the in Pretoria. However, the injury curse struck again and Watson missed the remainder of the 2014 through a serious concussion.

This is distinct from the better known Tornado Alley and has a high frequency of strong, long-track tornadoes that move at higher speeds. The term was coined by NSSFC Director Allen Pearson after witnessing a tornado outbreak which included more than 9 long-track, violent tornadoes that killed 121 on February 21, 1971. The specific characteristics of the Southeast led to VORTEX-SE, a field project studying tornadogenesis, diagnosis and forecasting, in addition to social science implications, and examines both supercellular tornadoes and those resulting from quasi-linear convective system (QLCS) thunderstorm structures.VORTEX Southeast  Geography  The Dixie Alley region indicated by red shaded area. Dixie Alley includes much of the area of the lower Mississippi Valley. It stretches from eastern Texas and Arkansas across Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and far western Kentucky to upstate South Carolina and western North Carolina; the area reaches as far north as southeast Missouri. Another source places all of Arkansas within Dixie Alley. Although tornadoes are less frequent in these states than they are in the southern Plains, the southeastern states have had more tornado- related deaths than any of the Plains states (excluding Texas). This is partly due to the fact that there are relatively high number of strong/violent long tracked tornadoes and higher population density of this region, as well as the Southern United States having the highest percentage of manufactured homes in the US, where 63% of the overall tornado-related fatalities occur. According to the National Climatic Data Center, for the period January 1, 1950 - October 31, 2006, Alabama and Kansas received the largest amount of F5 tornadoes. Complicating matters is that tornadoes are rarely visible in this area, as they are more likely to be rain-wrapped, embedded in shafts of heavy rain, and that the hilly topography and heavily forested landscape makes them difficult to see.  Prevalent tornado characteristics  Tornado in Mississippi, located in Dixie Alley, obscured by trees and featuring a notably low, rugged base. Dixie Alley is part of a region of enhanced tornadic activity extending between the Appalachian and Rocky Mountains, but tornadoes and outbreaks in the Dixie Alley region exhibit some statistically distinguishable characteristics than the more well known Tornado Alley. Tornadic storms in Dixie Alley are most often high precipitation supercells due to an increase of moisture from proximity to the nearby Gulf of Mexico. The Dixie Alley tornadoes accompanying the HP supercells are often partially or fully wrapped in rain visually impairing the tornadoes to storm spotters and chasers, law enforcement, and the public. Increases of warmth and instability in conjunction with strong wind shear in the Dixie Alley region impacts the times when tornadoes form. In the traditional Tornado Alley, tornadoes most often form from the mid afternoon to early evening. Dixie Alley's instability can be maintained long after sunset due to being adjacent to the Gulf, increasing the frequency of intense nighttime and early morning tornadoes. There is also a less focused tornado season which tends to be most active in early spring and late autumn but can continue throughout the winter and into late spring, which can lead to complacency among residents of the region. The region often is subject to tornadoes much earlier than the general national peak from May and June, usually from February to Mid-April, and several notorious outbreaks have struck during the late winter and early spring and also in late fall. The complacency situation was noted after the 2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak in February 2008 that hit the Dixie Alley killing 57 people, many people indicated that they had underestimated the threat of severe weather on that day since it was well before the peak of tornado season. A 2018 study found in the U.S. an overall eastward shift of tornado frequency and impacts - toward Dixie Alley.https://www.usatoday.com/story/weather/2018/10/17/tornado-alley- shifting-east/1660803002/ The study found relatively-lower tornado frequency and impacts in parts of the traditional Tornado Alley, especially areas from north-central Texas toward the Houston, Texas area, and relatively-higher tornado frequency and impacts in parts of the Mid-South, especially eastern Arkansas, the greater Memphis, Tennessee area and northern Mississippi - all areas near the heart of Dixie Alley (see especially Figure 4). Variations in climate patterns and teleconnections, such as the El Ni√±o‚ÄìSouthern Oscillation (ENSO) can also have significant impacts on tornadic activity in the region from year to year. Climate change is also expected to affect tornado activity in the region.  Notable outbreaks  Dixie Alley has been subject to numerous tornado outbreaks throughout history, including very intense outbreaks and those of very large spatial and temporal extent. Notorious outbreaks affecting the region include: the Great Natchez Tornado, the 1884 Enigma tornado outbreak, the April 1924 tornado outbreak, the 1932 Deep South tornado outbreak, the 1936 Tupelo-Gainesville tornado outbreak, the April 1957 Southeastern tornado outbreak, the 1984 Carolinas tornado outbreak, and the November 1992 tornado outbreak. The 1974 Super Outbreak also hit the area very hard, producing multiple F5 tornadoes in Alabama, and F4 tornadoes in North Georgia and the Appalachian southwest of North Carolina. More recently the region was hit by the 2008 Super Tuesday tornado outbreak followed by the tornado outbreak of April 14‚Äì16, 2011, the deadliest since the 2008 outbreak. Two weeks after the April 14‚Äì16 event, Dixie Alley was the epicenter of the 2011 Super Outbreak, which was the largest tornado outbreak ever recorded, as well as the fourth-deadliest outbreak in United States history, with over 300 people dead.

The route originates at a junction with U.S. Route 31E and US 150 (Bardstown Road) in Louisville, Kentucky. On the other side of intersection, KY 155 becomes a local road called Trevilian Way. KY 155 continues through several Louisville suburbs to Jeffersontown, Kentucky and into Spencer County, where it eventually merges with Kentucky Route 55 a few miles north of Taylorsville, Kentucky. It is known locally as Taylorsville Road from its northern terminus until a junction with Kentucky Route 148 in Jefferson County, where it is known as Taylorsville Lake Road until reaching its southern terminus. Despite what its two local names would suggest, KY 155 itself does not actually reach either Taylorsville Lake or Taylorsville, but through connecting roads it is the primary non-interstate link between Louisville and both of those locations. It is 4 to 6 lanes through much of Jefferson County, and is a major thoroughfare connecting Louisville's inner east side neighborhoods with suburban shopping and business areas, such as the Hurstbourne Parkway corridor. It interchanges with both I-264 and I-265. History KY 155's history is relatively lengthy, the intersection with Bardstown Road (once called the Bardstown Turnpike) was originally known as Doup's Point, the home of a major Louisville family. In 1848 legislation was passed authorizing the construction of a spur route from the Bardstown Turnpike near Doup's Point to Taylorsville, by way of Jeffersontown. The route, initially called the Louisville and Taylorsville Pike, was completed by the late 19th century and was expanded to 4 lanes in the 1960s. In the early 1990s, as a part of improvements to I-264 and its interchanges, KY 155 was widened to 6 lanes south of the interchange and local access roads were built parallel to it, to provide easier access for residents whose driveways had previously opened onto the highway.

Biography Hocevar was born in Forbach, Moselle, France. From 1995 to 1997, he took preparatory classes at the Lyc√©e Fabert in Metz, Moselle, France.\\"Samuel HOCEVAR - CV.\\" (DVI, PDF, PS ). Sam Hocevar Official Website. Retrieved on September 18, 2010. He graduated in 2002 from √âcole centrale Paris, after receiving the \\"Award of Information Technology and Communication\\" from the SNCF as the most promising student in his class. He specialized in electromechanical systems and applied mechatronics, and project management. From 2005 to 2006, Hocevar was a Wikimedia France board member. Hocevar has been active in the Debian project, and was elected Debian project leader on 17 April 2007. Hocevar's Debian leadership platform stated a preference for finishing larger numbers of small projects in succession, echoing the Japanese management philosophy of Kaizen that constant, incremental improvements to a project would generate more gains per unit of time than large single leaps of performance. Hocevar was succeeded by Steve McIntyre on 16 April 2008. Hocevar has also contributed to the VideoLAN project. He has made large contributions to almost all software of the VideoLAN project, especially to VLC media player and libdvdcss, since 1998. He is the author of various free software programs, such as , a data fuzzer, and libcaca, a color ASCII art renderer. He is also the current maintainer of the Extension Language Kit Scheme interpreter, which has found use in many multimedia applications including audio processing. Hocevar has worked on reverse engineering and image processing. He reverse engineered DVD subtitles in 2000, and in 2005, it was found that the DRM software which triggered the Sony BMG CD copy protection scandal had unlawfully pirated open source code from the VideoLAN project which Hocevar was involved in authoring. Hocevar's experience in image processing includes authoring a CAPTCHA decoding framework called PWNtcha. PWNtcha was the first CAPTCHA decoder framework to defeat multiple CAPTCHAs and was referred to as the \\"most famous\\" CAPTCHA breaker in a 2009 Stanford University publication. Hocevar authored the WTFPL version 2, an extremely liberal, permissive free software license that is recognized by the Free Software Foundation. He has also been cited for his \\"whimsical\\" copyleft activism.

History Anatolian high schools were established as an alternative to expensive private schools teaching in foreign languages and were modeled after the grammar schools. Some of the Anatolian high schools are newly established while other prestigious public schools were added to this category. Originally six Maarif Koleji, followed by more Anatolian Schools in the later years, were established in 6 major cities of Turkey; namely Istanbul, Izmir, Samsun, Konya, Eski≈üehir, and Diyarbakƒ±r, in 1955, based on a special law enacted by the Turkish Parliament. The name was changed to \\"Anatolian High Schools\\" in 1975. These schools admitted students based on an academic test administered at the end of grade 5, which was the basic elementary education back then. The schools offered a year of foreign language education as a preparatory year followed by foreign-language medium of instruction seven years of middle and high school grades. Several private schools followed the Anatolian School model particularly as an alternative to foreign-based American, French and German schools. There is also one Anatolian School in Baku, Azerbaijan and one in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. Currently, many of the Anatolian high schools' teaching language is English, German, or French. Other high schools in Turkey teach in Turkish; foreign languages are taught only as elective courses.

In its pure form, it is a white amorphous powder which is freely soluble in water. Potential uses Lobeline has been sold, in tablet form, for use as a smoking cessation aid, and may have application in the treatment of other drug addictions such as addiction to amphetamines, cocaine, or alcohol. However, there is limited clinical evidence of any efficacy. Toxicity Ingestion of lobeline may cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, coughing, dizziness, visual disturbances, hearing disturbances, mental confusion, weakness, slowed heart rate, increased blood pressure, increased breathing rate, tremors, and seizures. Lobeline has a narrow therapeutic index; the potentially beneficial dose of lobeline is very close to the toxic dose. Pharmacology Lobeline has multiple mechanisms of action, acting as a VMAT2 ligand, which stimulates dopamine release to a moderate extent when administered alone, but reduces the dopamine release caused by methamphetamine. It also inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and serotonin, and acts as a mixed agonist‚Äìantagonist at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors to which it binds at the subunit interfaces of the extracellular domain.PDB entry . It is also an antagonist at Œº-opioid receptors. It seems to be a P-glycoprotein inhibitor, according to at least one study. It has been hypothesized that P-glycoprotein inhibition reduces chemotherapeutic resistance in cancer, presumably affecting any substrates of P-gp. Analogous compounds, such as lobelane (a minor alkaloid found in the same plants) and its synthetic derivatives have similar biological effects with somewhat different relative affinities to VMAT and other proteins. A related alkaloid sedamine, with only one 2-phenylethyl group on the piperidine ring and found in plants of genus sedum, is known to be an inhibitor of pea seedlings amine oxidase, but its affinity to proteins such as the dopamine transporter has apparently not been tested.

The book follows the fictional character of Arn Magnusson from his birth and until he sets off to Jerusalem. Arn is born in Arn√§s, Sweden in the year 1150. At the age of 5, he has an accident while climbing a scaffold and is saved due to his mother's prayers to Saint Bernard of Clairvaux. The conditions stated in the prayer for their sons salvation is that he will be donated to God's work on earth. He is to be sent to Varnhem Abbey, to which his mother has donated the land and is so counted as its founder. Because of a dispute of the validity of the donation the Queen of the Swedes harasses the Cistercian monks into flight. The abbot and his subjects relocate to Denmark awaiting the excommunication of the Swedish royal family. One of the brothers of Varnhem and Danish Vitae Scholae is brother Guilbert, a former Knight Templar, who instructs him in the use of the sword and the art of medieval warfare in the Holy Lands. After relocating back to Varnhem again, the Prior of the convent, Father Henri, instructs Arn to witness the outside world for himself before taking the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience (q.v. Evangelical counsels). Arn does so, but falls into the terrible sin of having sexual intercourse with Cecelia, who is also in the nunnery. Cecelia gets pregnant and tells her sister Katarina. Katarina is jealous and tells the Head Mother that not only has Cecelia had sex with Arn, but reveals that Arn has had carnal knowledge before marriage with herself as well (she seduced him while he was drunk after his first visit to her father's homestead.). Arn is then condemned to spend twenty years in the Holy Land, as a Knight Templar, and Cecelia is kept in the nunnery and sentenced to twenty years of penance in the convent of Gudhem; her boy child is taken away from her.

Life and career Born in Rome into a humble family, Fabrizi debuted on stage in a suburban theater in 1931. He soon got a local success thanks to his comical sketches and macchiette (i.e. comical monologues caricaturing stock characters), and became a star of the Roman revue and avanspettacolo. He made his film debut during the war, in 1942, and in a short time established himself as one of the most talented actors of the time, spacing from comedy to drama. After a number of successful comedies, in 1945 he played the iconic Don Pietro in the neo-realist drama Rome, Open City, and following the critical and commercial success of the film he had a number of leading roles in other neo-realist films. Already active as a screenwriter, in 1948 he debuted as a director with the drama Immigrants. In the 1950s and 1960s he was often paired on the screen with Tot√≤ and with Peppino De Filippo. In 1964 he got a large success on stage with the musical comedy Rugantino, he also toured across Europe, in Latin America and in Broadway. Like the Italian actor Tot√≤ and others, Fabrizi was also initiated to the Scottish Rite Freemasonry. =Personal life= Fabrizi was married to the singer Beatrice Rocchi, best known with her stage name Reginella, until her death in 1981. His sister Elena Fabrizi was also an actress. =Awards and recognition= Fabrizi during his career won two Nastro d'Argento Awards, for best actor for Alessandro Blasetti's Prima comunione and for best supporting actor in Ettore Scola's We All Loved Each Other So Much, and a special David di Donatello for his career in 1988.

It is a natural product that was first isolated from Actinobacterium Streptomyces toxytricini. The popular antiobesity drug orlistat (trade names Xenical and alli) is a saturated derivative of lipstatin.  Biosynthesis  Lipstatin biosynthesis pathway in Streptomyces toxytricini. Lipstatin is composed of a 2-hexyl-3,5-dihydroxy-7,10-hexadecadienoic-Œ≤-lactone 22 carbon backbone from fatty acid synthesis pathway and an N-formyl-L-leucine group ester linked to the 5-hydroxyl group of the back bone. The composts of the lipstatin are ultimately from linoleic acid, octanoic acid, and L-leucine. The 22 carbon Œ≤-lactone moiety is derived from Claisen condensation between 3-hydroxytetradeca-5,8-dienyl-CoA derived from linoleic acid and hexyl- malonyl-ACP derived from octanoic acid. Linoleic acid is first attached to CoA through some acyl-CoA synthetase homologue synthesized by lipstatin biosynthetic operons (Lst) and goes through two Œ≤-oxidation to hydroxytetradeca-5,8-dienyl-CoA. 3‚Äô hydroxyl group from solution H2O is added by enoyl reductase homologue followed by enoyl hydratase homologue. Octanoic acid is also attached to CoA through similar acyl-CoA synthetase homologue (LstC) to form octanoyl-CoA. Octanoyl-CoA is 2‚Äô carboxylated and loaded to acyl carrier protein (ACP) borrowed from primary metabolism to form hexyl- malonyl-ACP. The Œ≤-lactone ring is formed by reduction of 3-keto group by 3-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase homologue followed by a spontaneously nucleophilic attack of the 3-hydroxyl group on the carbonyl of the ACP-tether acyl intermediate. This step follows the esterification of the N-formyl-L- leucine group. The N-formyl-L-leucine group is derived from L-leucine. L-leucine was activated by LstE forming thioester and its Œ±-amine group is formylated by LstF. Finally, 5-hydroxyl of 22 carbon Œ≤-lactone backbone nucleophilic attacks on the acyl carbon of the formyl-leucine and forms the lipstatin.

It was originally developed by Softricity, a company based in Boston, Massachusetts, acquired by Microsoft on July 17, 2006. App-V represents Microsoft's entry to the application virtualization market, alongside their other virtualization technologies such as Hyper-V, Microsoft User Environment Virtualization (UE-V), Remote Desktop Services, and System Center Virtual Machine Manager. Overview App-V allows applications to be deployed (\\"streamed\\") in real- time to any client from a virtual application server. It removes the need for traditional local installation of the applications, although a standalone deployment method is also supported. With a streaming-based implementation, the App-V client needs to be installed on the client machines and application data that is stored on the virtual application server is installed (streamed) to the client cache on demand when it is first used, or pre-installed in a local cache. The App-V stack sandboxes the execution environment so that an application does not make changes directly to the underlying operating system's file system and/or Windows Registry, but rather is contained in an application-specific \\"bubble\\". App-V applications are also sandboxed from each other, so that different versions of the same application can be run under App-V concurrently and so that mutually exclusive applications can co-exist on the same system. Nevertheless the separation is not a security boundary. \\"App-V 5.1 is not a security product and does not provide any guarantees for a secure environment.\\" App-V thus allows centralized installation and management of deployed applications. It supports policy based access control; administrators can define and restrict access to the applications by certain users, or on certain computers, by defining policies governing the usage. App-V also features a tracking interface to track the usage of the virtualized application. Servers may be implemented in highly available configurations when desired. The App-V client presents the user with a neat, locally installed application experience for virtualized applications. Access to start the virtualized application appears to be identical to the locally install application, as extensions for the application are integrated into the user's desktop shell by the App-V client. When two or more virtual applications have a dependency on each other, the individual virtualized applications may also be configured to run together in a single isolated bubble. Microsoft App-V is an additional component requiring licensing for use. Licensing is user-based and is either acquired by licensing Microsoft Desktop Optimization Pack (MDOP) for use on client operating systems, or as part of the Microsoft Remote Desktop Server Client Access License for use on Remote Desktop Servers. MDOP is a suite of technologies available as a subscription for Software Assurance customers. There also exists a licensing model that exists for hosting (cloud services) providers. Major versions and variants Microsoft released Version 5 of App-V in late November 2012, which is a third generation major redesign of the entire platform. Version 5 modernized the product, replacing components designed for use originally against Windows NT and Windows 2000 some 11 years earlier. The redesign also allowed for support of newer operating system features and improvements to virtualization support. Version 4.x of the product is still in widespread use and is currently in active support. Microsoft extended the version 4 based support for up to Windows 8.1 and Server 2012 R2 client operating systems; however, some of the newer operating system features are not available for virtualized applications using App-V 4.x. The Microsoft standard end of support date for App-V 4.x was July 2015. Versions 3.x and 2.x are not known to be in production use any more; support for these versions ended with the acquisition of Softricity by Microsoft. Versions 2.x through 4.x represent the second generation application virtualization product. There was no 1.x version of the product. Prior to the release of SoftGrid 2.0, Softricity was known as SoftwareWow!. SoftwareWow! was an early cloud based service provider with an application store that streamed applications (primarily games) to consumers. The service used an in-house first generation product to provide Software As A Service (SaaS). Although little online information exists about the company today, this product provided streaming services with very limited virtualization support. An offshoot of App-V was released by Microsoft under the name Microsoft Server Application Virtualization (‚ÄúApp-V for Servers‚Äù). This platform, which supports virtualization redirection but without isolation, is aimed at delivering virtualized server loads that would not have intra- application conflicts. The product is available as part of System Center Virtual Machine Manager, and is typically used to spin up new instances of servers on a demand-driven basis. Architecture Microsoft offers three options for the deployment of virtual applications, which affects the architectural components used: *A set of servers dedicated to App-V. *System Center Configuration Manager integration. *\\"Stand-alone\\" mode wherein the application may be delivered via other means. The implementation of these three deployment options are different when version 5.x or 4.x of App-V is used. Each are described separately. =Architecture in versions 5.x= The 5.x based architecture has three major options that may be used. All three of these options use a few common components: *Microsoft Application Virtualization 5.x Sequencer, which is used to package a customized application for virtualized delivery. *Microsoft Application Virtualization 5.x Client, which is used at the operating system used to run the virtual application. Two forms of the client exist, one for desktop operating systems (such as Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 and Windows 8), and one for server operating systems configured for use as Remote Desktop Session Host servers. *Microsoft Application Virtualization Report Server, an optional component that can gather usage information (called metering) of the virtualized applications. *Microsoft Application Virtualization Client Console, an optional component that can be delivered to client systems as a virtual application. Typically, the console is not required for end-users, however deploying the console application provides the user with additional control over the virtual applications that have been previously authorized and delivered. The remainder of the 5.x architecture is dependent on the deployment option used. Full App-V 5.x Server option The Full App-V 5.x Server composed of the following additional components: *Microsoft Application Virtualization 5.x Management Server, used to define applications and connection groups and assign them to Active Directory Security Groups containing lists of users or computers authorized to use the application. This server also distributes a summary of this information to multiple Publishing Servers. The Management Server is implemented as Web Service that stores configuration information in a back-end database. The Web Service may be accessed using a Silverlight-enabled web browser or PowerShell. *Microsoft Application Virtualization Publishing Server, used to authenticate users and computers and deliver appropriate virtual application metadata for publishing to the client. *Package Store, a simple file share that will be used by the clients to stream virtual applications from. In some cases, the Package Store may be fronted by a web server. Configuration Manager integration option The Configuration Manager composed of the following components: *Microsoft System Center Configuration Manager Site Server, used to define operating images, traditional application packages for installation, virtual applications, and other deployment tasks. These items may also be assigned to collections of users and computers, along with requirements and dependencies. This information is stored in a database and delivered, via a Distribution Point, to client machines. *Microsoft System Center Distribution Point, used to cache content for deployment for a highly scalable solution. *Microsoft System Center Client Agent, used to pull deployment metadata and content from the Distribution Point, and implement a variety of client component actions. From an App-V perspective, this component delivers the virtual application to the App-V Client. App-V 5 requires the use of System Center Configuration Manager 2012, and above, for full support of App-V features. Deployment by older versions, or other electronic delivery systems, are also possible by using the virtual msi method of deployment. Standalone mode The App-V 5.x clients contains a PowerShell API that is ultimately used by both of the server modes above. It is sometimes desirable to use this API directly at the client, either manually or using additional tooling developed by third parties. =Architecture in versions 2.x through 4.x= The 4.x based architecture has three major options that may be used as well. All three of these options use a couple of common components: *Microsoft Application Virtualization 4.x Sequencer, which is used to package a customized application for virtualized delivery. *Microsoft Application Virtualization 4.x Client, which is used at the operating system used to run the virtual application. Four forms of the client exist, combined in sets that support either x86 or x64 operating systems. One set for desktop operating systems (such as Windows XP and above), and the other set for server operating systems configured for use as Remote Desktop Session Host servers. Dedicated App-V management server The App-V 4.x system architecture is composed of the following components: *Microsoft Systems Center Virtual Application Management Server, which is used to define applications and assign them to Active Directory Users, or Security Groups containing lists of users, authorized to use the application. The server also performs runtime authentication against authorized lists and records application usage (metering) information in a database for reporting. *Microsoft Systems Center Virtual Application Management Service, which is a .NET remoting web service, manages client requests for applications. This server works in conjunction with the Management Server to provide authorized application metadata for publishing, verification of authorized use, and reporting data. The server also handles streaming operations of the virtualized packages using an extension of the RTSP protocol. *App-V Management Console, the management tool to set up, administer and manage App-V servers. It can be used to define policies that govern the usage of the applications. It can also be used to create, manage, update and replicate virtualized application packages. Shared System Center Configuration Manager In 2009 Microsoft offered a new way to implement App-V with enhancements to System Center Configuration Manager. System Center Configuration Manager Architecture consists of the following components: *System Center Configuration Manager Site Server, serving as the primary repository for holding system images, application packages created using traditional installers, and virtual applications. *System Center Configuration Manager Distribution Server, used to cache and distribute the software on a more local level. App-V 4.x has direct integrations with Configuration Manager 2007 SP1 through 2012 R2. \\"Stand-alone\\" mode The App-V clients may also be used in a \\"stand-alone mode\\" without either of the server infrastructures previously described. In this case, the sequenced packages are delivered using an external technique, such as an Electronic Software Delivery system or manual deployment. Operation Aside from the operations associated with the deployment operations, App-V Application Virtualization mainly comprises two componentsthe App-V Sequencer and the App-V Client. The App-V sequencer is the component which re-packages an application for virtualization and streaming. It analyzes the application for the resources that it requires, supports customization of the applications, and from this creates a package containing the executable components, data files, and registry settings required by the application. The package format for the 4.x and 5.x versions are quite different: *The 5.x product uses an App-V format that is based on standard compression formats with additional features. Internally, much of the metadata formatting is borrowed from AppX. *The App-V 4.x versions produce packages using the SFT format, along with additional files based on a modified version of the Open Software Description (OSD) specification originally proposed to the WC3 in 1997 by Microsoft and Marimba. The sequencer monitors the application installation, configuration, and runtime use of file and registry resources to determine package contents and configuration. It abstracts machine and user specific information to improve portability of the application components, allowing most applications to be run by different users, on different hardware, and even on different operating systems in some cases. The package is also configured for streaming operations, where portions of files may be delivered on an as-needed basis to clients. Guidelines for sequencing applications are different for the 4.x and 5.x versions. The App-V client receives virtual application package definitions in several ways. When configured to receive from a Full App-V Infrastructure Server, this occurs automatically on logon, or a timer, and is initiated by the App-V Client. It also may be sent instructions via a client API, which is used by System Center deployments, the virtual msi, and stand- alone methods. The App-V 5.x client API is PowerShell based, while the 4.x client uses a proprietary sftmime interface. Upon receiving the package, the client will download appropriate metadata, and possibly (dependent on both package and client configurations) some or all of the package components. The client is designed to utilize a streaming file system that operates much like local file paging activity. This allows for starting the application without all of the file(s) present in the cache locally. When the application requires a file portion not present, an operation called a stream-fault is performed that retrieves the needed file portion. The streamed package contents are cached by the client in memory for the duration of the application session, and may be retained in a local disk cache for future use. User settings are stored in the local system itself using redirection to ensure that the cached copy of the application is not changed. In some cases, this allows for the deployment of applications that are not multi-user aware to be used on Remote Desktop Shared Host systems. Capabilities Specific to Version 5.x Version 5.x, in addition to being a redesign, added a number capabilities not previously available in the 4.x version. 5.0 Service Pack 2 added to these. They include: *Support for additional integrations. Applications have many ways to provide integration to the operating system and user desktop shell. Previously, only application shortcuts, file type associations, and COM integrations were available for providing the user a native-like experience. Version 5.x, especially with Service Pack 2 and beyond, significantly expanded the types of integrations, called Application Extensions in App-V. In addition to improved Shortcut support, Protocol Handlers, Application Capabilities, Software Clients, App Paths, and a variety of shell extensions, browser helper objects, and Active-X integrations were added. Many of these extensions help overcome the objections to virtualizing complicated applications such as Microsoft Office and plug-ins to Office. *Application Size. The 4GB package size limitation is gone. No documented limit exists for App-v 5.x packages. *Improved Scripting. Dependent components that cannot be virtualized may now be installed locally by the App-V client when needed using the new scripting interface, even when the logged in user does not have administrative privileges to install software. This includes dependent device drivers. *Connection Groups: Used when multiple packages need to work together in a single virtual application environment, this replaces the Dynamic Suite Composition added to App-V 4.5. The primary benefit of this redesign is that the Connection Groups are now managed objects at the App-V or Configuration Manager level, rather than hidden modifications made by an administrator. *RunVirtual: Sometimes virtual applications are started using locally installed components, such as a local web browser using virtualized plug-ins. Previously, virtualizing these applications caused issues for users that already created their own shortcuts to the local component. Using RunVirtual, the administrator can ensure that any launch of the local component will be virtualized.  Limitations of version 4.x  * Microsoft Office plug-ins: Although one can sequence Microsoft Office plug-ins, it is not advised to sequence them due to many technical & usage issues. For example, in a situation where there are more than two plug-ins used by a user, if they are sequenced separately, then the user does not have control over which plug-in sequence starts when he opens a document. The only work around to resolve the issue is by creating a single suite or dynamic suite of all the plug-ins. * Application Size: If the maximum client cache size is set to at least 4 GB (The max can be 64 GB), then the maximum size of application (sft file) which can be streamed on that machine is 4 GB. All applications that have an installed footprint greater than or equal to the max client size, set by the client, should not be sequenced. The maximum application size Softgrid can handle is 4GB, due to the use of the FAT32 file-system. * Device Driver: App-V presently does not support sequencing of kernel-mode device drivers; thus any application that installs a device driver cannot be sequenced. The only exception to this is when the device driver can be pre-installed locally; in this case, the application is sequenced without the device driver. * Shortcuts: Applications should have minimum of one shortcut. If no shortcuts are present, then the application should be sequenced in a suite along with the application that needs it. Internet Explorer plugins require a special shortcut to start the browser process under the virtualization layer. * Middleware: Middleware applications may not be good candidates for sequencing as they may be runtime prerequisites for multiple applications. With later versions of App-V, they can be sequenced into a separate package that other virtual applications are linked to using a feature called Dynamic Suite Composition. * Path hard coding: The application should not have folder/file path hard coded in the application itself. Some applications hard code the path of files in their executables rather than parameterizing them or storing them in the Windows Registry. Configuration files ending in extensions such as ini, conf, dat, and txt are good places to look for application-specific settings of path information that may cause problems. Failing that, a shim can be used to remediate the application where source code or an update is not available. * Auto Update: Applications with automatic updates should not be sequenced if their update mechanism cannot be disabled. Sequenced applications sometimes fail to update. In addition, allowing auto-update leads to non compliance of application version. * Services: Virtualization of services that must start at boot-time are not supported. All other types of services may generally be virtualized; they are started when the virtual application starts and shuts down or when an application main executable terminates. * Licensing Policies: Applications with licensing enforcement tied to the machine, e.g. the license is tied to the system's MAC address or harddisk serial number. This type of application should not be sequenced if the activation can not be done by the user at the first launch of sequenced application, manually or by script. * Internet Explorer & Service Packs: Microsoft does not support sequencing of any version of Internet Explorer.

The stack includes native implementation of IPv6, as well as a complete overhaul of IPv4. The new TCP/IP stack uses a new method to store configuration settings that enables more dynamic control and does not require a computer restart after a change in settings. The new stack, implemented as a dual-stack model, depends on a strong host-model and features an infrastructure to enable more modular components that one can dynamically insert and remove. Architecture Architecture of the Next Generation TCP/IP stack The Next Generation TCP/IP stack connects to NICs via a Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) driver. The network stack, implemented in \`tcpip.sys\` implements the Transport, Network and Data link layers of the TCP/IP model. The Transport layer includes implementations for TCP, UDP and unformatted RAW protocols. At the Network layer, IPv4 and IPv6 protocols are implemented in a dual-stack architecture. And the Data link layer (also called Framing layer) implements 802.3, 802.1, PPP, Loopback and tunnelling protocols. Each layer can accommodate Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) shims, which allows packets at that layer to be introspected and also host the WFP Callout API. The networking API is exposed via three components: ;Winsock: A user mode API for abstracting network communication using sockets and ports. Datagram sockets are used for UDP, whereas Stream sockets are for TCP. While Winsock is a user mode library, it uses a kernel mode driver, called Ancillary Function Driver (AFD) to implement certain functionality. ;Winsock Kernel (WSK): A kernel-mode API providing the same socket-and-port abstraction as Winsock, while exposing other features such as Asynchronous I/O using I/O request packets. ;Transport Driver Interface (TDI): A kernel-mode API which can be used for legacy protocols like NetBIOS. It includes a component, known as TDX to map the TDI functionality to the network stack.  User interface  The Network and Sharing Center The user interface for configuring, troubleshooting and working with network connections has changed significantly from prior versions of Windows as well. Users can make use of the new \\"Network and Sharing Center\\" to see the status of their network connections, and to access every aspect of configuration. A single icon in the notification area (system tray) represents connectivity through all network adapters, whether wired or wireless. The network can be browsed using Network Explorer, which replaces Windows XP's \\"My Network Places\\". Network Explorer items can be a shared device such as a scanner, or a file share. The Network Location Awareness (NLA) service uniquely identifies each network and exposes the network's attributes and connectivity type so that applications can determine the optimal network configuration. However, applications have to use the NLA APIs explicitly to be aware of the network connectivity changes, and adapt accordingly. Windows Vista uses the Link Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD) protocol to graphically present how different devices are connected over a network, as a Network Map. In addition, the Network Map uses LLTD to determine connectivity information and media type (wired or wireless), so that the map is topologically accurate. The ability to know network topology is important for diagnosing and solving networking problems, and for streaming content over a network connection. Any device can implement LLTD to appear on the Network Map with an icon representing the device, allowing users one-click access to the device's user interface. When LLTD is invoked, it provides metadata about the device that contains static or state information, such as the MAC address, IPv4/IPv6 address, signal strength etc. Network classification by location Windows Vista classifies the networks it connects to as either Public, Private or Domain and uses Network Location Awareness to switch between network types. Different network types have different firewall policies. An open network such as a public wireless network is classified as Public and is the most restrictive of all network settings. In this mode other computers on the network are not trusted and external access to the computer, including sharing of files and printers, is disabled. A home network is classified as Private, and it enables file sharing between computers. If the computer is joined to a domain, the network is classified as a Domain network; in such a network the policies are set by the domain controller. When a network is first connected to, Windows Vista prompts to choose the correct network type. On subsequent connections to the network, the service is used to gain information on which network is connected to and automatically switch to the network configuration for the connected network. Windows Vista introduces a concept of network profiles. For each network, the system stores the IP address, DNS server, Proxy server and other network features specific to the network in that network's profile. So when that network is subsequently connected to, the settings need not be reconfigured, the ones saved in its profile are used. In the case of mobile machines, the network profiles are chosen automatically based on what networks are available. Each profile is part of either a Public, Private or Domain network. Internet Protocol v6 The Windows Vista networking stack supports the dual Internet Protocol (IP) layer architecture in which the IPv4 and IPv6 implementations share common Transport and Framing layers. Windows Vista provides a GUI for configuration of both IPv4 and IPv6 properties. IPv6 is now supported by all networking components and services. The Windows Vista DNS client can use IPv6 transport. Internet Explorer in Windows Vista and other applications that use WinINet (Windows Mail, file sharing) support literal IPv6 addresses (). Windows Firewall and the IPsec Policies snap-in support IPv6 addresses as permissible character strings. In IPv6 mode, Windows Vista can use the Link Local Multicast Name Resolution (LLMNR) protocol, as described in , to resolve names of local hosts on a network which does not have a DNS server running. This service is useful for networks without a central managing server, and for ad hoc wireless networks. IPv6 can also be used over PPP-based dial-up and PPPoE connections. Windows Vista can also act as a client/server for file sharing or DCOM over IPv6. Support for DHCPv6, which can be used with IPv6, is also included. IPv6 can even be used when full native IPv6 connectivity is not available, using Teredo tunneling; this can even traverse most IPv4 symmetric Network Address Translations (NATs) as well. Full support for multicast is also included, via the MLDv2 and SSM protocols. The IPv6 interface ID is randomly generated for permanent autoconfigured IPv6 addresses to prevent determining the MAC address based on known company IDs of NIC manufacturers. Wireless networks Support for wireless networks is built into the network stack itself as a new set of APIs called Native Wifi, and does not emulate wired connections, as was the case with previous versions of Windows. This allows implementation of wireless-specific features such as larger frame sizes and optimized error recovery procedures. Native Wifi is exposed by Auto Configuration Module (ACM) which replaces Windows XP's Wireless Zero Configuration. The ACM is extensible, so developers can incorporate additional wireless functionality (such as automatic wireless roaming) and override the automatic configuration and connection logic without affecting the built-in framework. It is easier to find wireless networks in range and tell which networks are open and which are closed. Hidden wireless networks, which do not advertise their name (SSID) are better supported. Security for wireless networks is improved with improved support for newer wireless standards like 802.11i. EAP-TLS is the default authentication mode. Connections are made at the most secure connection level supported by the wireless access point. WPA2 can be used even in ad-hoc mode. Windows Vista also provides a Fast Roaming service that will allow users to move from one access point to another without loss of connectivity. Preauthentication with the new wireless access point can be used to retain the connectivity. Wireless networks are managed from either the Connect to a network dialog box within the GUI or the netsh wlan command from the shell. Settings for wireless networks can also be configured using Group policy. Windows Vista enhances security when joining a domain over a wireless network. It can use Single Sign On to use the same credentials to join a wireless network as well as the domain housed within the network. In this case, the same RADIUS server is used for both PEAP authentication for joining the network and MS-CHAP v2 authentication to log into the domain. A bootstrap wireless profile can also be created on the wireless client, which first authenticates the computer to the wireless network and joins the network. At this stage, the machine still does not have any access to the domain resources. The machine will run a script, stored either on the system or on USB thumb drive, which authenticates it to the domain. Authentication can be done either by using username and password combination or security certificates from a Public key infrastructure (PKI) vendor such as VeriSign. Wireless setup and configuration Windows Vista features Windows Connect Now which supports setting up a wireless network using several methods supported in the Wi-Fi Protected Setup standard. It implements a native code API, Web Services for Devices (WSDAPI) to support Devices Profile for Web Services (DPWS) and also a managed code implementation in WCF. DPWS enables simpler device discoverability like UPnP and describes available services to those clients. Function Discovery is a new technology that serves as an abstraction layer between applications and devices, allowing applications to discover devices by referencing the device's function, rather than by its bus type or the nature of its connection. Plug and Play Extensions (PnP-X) allow network-connected devices to appear as local devices inside Windows connected physically. UPnP support has also been enhanced to include integration with PnP-X and Function Discovery. Network performance Windows Vista's networking stack also uses several performance optimizations, which allow higher throughput by allowing faster recovery from packet losses, when using a high packet loss environment such as wireless networks. Windows Vista uses the NewReno () algorithm which allows a sender to send more data while retrying in case it receives a partial acknowledgement, which is acknowledgement from the receiver for only a part of data that has been received. It also uses Selective Acknowledgements (SACK) to reduce the amount of data to be retransmitted in case a portion of the data sent was not received correctly, and Forward RTO-Recovery (F-RTO) to prevent unnecessary retransmission of TCP segments when round trip time increases. It also includes Neighbour Unreachability Detection capability in both IPv4 and IPv6, which tracks the accessibility of neighboring nodes. This allows faster error recovery, in case a neighboring node fails. NDIS 6.0 introduced in Windows Vista supports offloading IPv6 traffic and checksum calculations for IPv6, improved manageability, scalability and performance with reduced complexity for NDIS miniports, and simpler models for writing Lightweight Filter Drivers (LWF). LWF drivers are a combination of NDIS intermediate drivers and a miniport driver that eliminate the need to write a separate protocol and miniport and have a bypass mode to examine only selected control and data paths. The TCP/IP stack also provides fail-back support for default gateway changes by periodically attempting to send TCP traffic through a previously detected unavailable gateway. This can provide faster throughput by sending traffic through the primary default gateway on the subnet. Another significant change that aims to improve network throughput is the automatic resizing of TCP Receive window. The receive window (RWIN) specifies how much data a host is prepared to receive, and is limited by, among other things, the available buffer space. In other words, it is a measure of how much data the remote transmitter can send before requiring an acknowledgement for the outstanding data. When the receive window is too small, the remote transmitter will frequently find that it has hit the limit of how much outstanding data it can transmit, even though there is enough bandwidth available to transmit more data. This leads to incomplete link utilization. So using a larger RWIN size boosts throughput in such situations; an auto-adjusting RWIN tries to keep the throughput rate as high as is permissible by the bandwidth of the link. Receive window auto tuning functionality continually monitors the bandwidth and the latency of TCP connections individually and optimize the receive window for each connection. The window size is increased in high-bandwidth (~5 Mbit/s+) or high-latency (>10ms) situations. Traditional TCP implementations uses the TCP Slow Start algorithm to detect how fast it can transmit without choking the receiver (or intermediate nodes). In a nutshell, it specifies that transmission should start at a slow rate, by transmitting a few packets. This number is controlled by the Congestion window ‚Äì which specifies the number of outstanding packets that has been transmitted but for which an acknowledgement of receipt from the receiver has not yet been received. As acknowledgements are received, the congestion window is expanded, one TCP segment at a time till an acknowledgement fails to arrive. Then the sender assumes that with the congestion window size of that instant, the network gets congested. However, a high bandwidth network can sustain a quite large congestion window without choking up. The slow start algorithm can take quite some time to reach that threshold ‚Äì leaving the network under-utilized for a significant time. The new TCP/IP stack also supports Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to keep throughput hit due to network congestion as low as possible. Without ECN, a TCP message segment is dropped by some router when its buffer is full. Hosts get no notice of building congestion until packets start being dropped. The sender detects the segment did not reach the destination; but due to lack of feedback from the congested router, it has no information on the extent of reduction in transmission rate it needs to make. Standard TCP implementations detect this drop when they time out waiting for acknowledgement from the receiver. The sender then reduces the size of its congestion window, which is the limit on the amount of data in flight at any time. Multiple packet drops can even result in a reset of the congestion window, to TCP's Maximum Segment Size, and a TCP Slow Start. Exponential backoff and only additive increase produce stable network behaviour, letting routers recover from congestion. However, the dropping of packets has noticeable impacts on time-sensitive streams like streaming media, because it takes time for the drop to be noticed and retransmitted. With ECN support enabled, the router sets two bits in the data packets that indicate to the receiver it is experiencing congestion (but not yet fully choked). The receiver in turn lets the sender know that a router is facing congestion and then the sender lowers its transmission rate by some amount. If the router is still congested, it will set the bits again, and eventually the sender will slow down even more. The advantage of this approach is that the router does not get full enough to drop packets, and thus the sender does not have to lower the transmission rate significantly to cause serious delays in time-sensitive streams; nor does it risk severe under- utilization of bandwidth. Without ECN, the only way routers can tell hosts anything is by dropping packets. ECN is like Random Early Drop, except that the packets are marked instead of dropped. The only caveat is that both sender and receiver, as well as all intermediate routers, have to be ECN-friendly. Any router along the way can prevent the use of ECN if it considers ECN-marked packets invalid and drops them (or more typically the whole connection setup fails because of a piece of network equipment that drops connection setup packets with ECN flags set). Routers that don't know about ECN can still drop packets normally, but there is some ECN-hostile network equipment on the Internet. For this reason, ECN is disabled by default. It can be enabled via the \`netsh interface tcp set global ecncapability=enabled\` command. In previous versions of Windows, all processing needed to receive or transfer data over one network interface was done by a single processor, even in a multi processor system. With supported network interface adapters, Windows Vista can distribute the job of traffic processing in network communication among multiple processors. This feature is called Receive Side Scaling. Windows Vista also supports network cards with TCP Offload Engine, that have certain hardware-accelerated TCP/IP-related functionality. Windows Vista uses its TCP Chimney Offload system to offload to such cards framing, routing, error-correction and acknowledgement and retransmission jobs required in TCP. However, for application compatibility, only TCP data transfer functionality is offloaded to the NIC, not TCP connection setup. This will remove some load from the CPU. Traffic processing in both IPv4 and IPv6 can be offloaded. Windows Vista also supports NetDMA, which uses the DMA engine to allow processors to be freed from the hassles of moving data between network card data buffers and application buffers. It requires specific hardware DMA architectures, such as Intel I/O Acceleration to be enabled. =Compound TCP= Compound TCP is a modified TCP congestion avoidance algorithm, meant to improve networking performance in all applications. It is not enabled by default in the pre-Service Pack 1 version of Windows Vista, but enabled in SP1 and Windows Server 2008. It uses a different algorithm to modify the congestion window ‚Äì borrowing from TCP Vegas and TCP New Reno. For every acknowledgement received, it increases the congestion window more aggressively, thus reaching the peak throughput much faster, increasing overall throughput.  Quality of Service  Windows Vista's networking stack includes integrated policy-based Quality of Service (QoS) functionality to prioritize network traffic. Quality of Service can be used to manage network usage by specific applications or users, by throttling the bandwidth available to them, or it can be used to limit bandwidth usage by other applications when high priority applications, such as real time conferencing applications, are being run, to ensure they get the bandwidth they need. Traffic throttling can also be used to prevent large data transfer operations from using up all the available bandwidth. QoS policies can be confined by application executable name, folder path, source and destination IPv4 or IPv6 addresses, source and destination TCP or UDP ports or a range of ports. In Windows Vista, QoS policies can be applied to any application at the Network Layer, thus eliminating the need to rewrite applications using QoS APIs to be QoS-aware. QoS policies can either be set on a per-machine basis or set by Active Directory Group policy objects which ensures that all Windows Vista clients connected to the Active Directory container (a domain, a site or an organizational unit) will enforce the policy settings. Windows Vista supports the Wireless Multimedia (WMM) profile classes for QoS in wireless networks as certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance: BG (for background data), BE (for Best Effort non real time data), VI (for real time videos) and VO (for real time voice data). When both the wireless access point as well as the wireless NIC supports the WMM profiles, Windows Vista can provide preferential treatment to the data sent. =qWave= The Feedback Loop of qWave Windows Vista includes a specialized QoS API called qWave (Quality Windows Audio/Video Experience), which is a pre-configured Quality of Service module for time dependent multimedia data, such as audio or video streams. qWave uses different packet priority schemes for real-time flows (such as multimedia packets) and best- effort flows (such as file downloads or e-mails) to ensure that real-time data gets as little delays as possible, while providing a high quality channel for other data packets. qWave is intended to ensure real-time transport of multimedia networks within a wireless network. qWave supports multiple simultaneous multimedia as well as data streams. qWave does not depend solely on bandwidth reservation schemes, as provided by RSVP for providing QoS guarantees, as the bandwidth in a wireless network fluctuates constantly. As a result, it also uses continuous bandwidth monitoring to implement service guarantees. Applications have to explicitly use the qWave APIs to use the service. When the multimedia application requests qWave to initiate a new media stream, qWave tries to reserve bandwidth using RSVP. At the same time, it uses QoS probes to make sure the network has enough bandwidth to support the stream. If the conditions are met, the stream is allowed, and prioritized so that other applications do not eat into its share of bandwidth. However, environmental factors can affect the reception of the wireless signals, which can reduce the bandwidth, even if no other stream is allowed to access the reserved bandwidth. Due to this, qWave continuously monitors the available bandwidth, and if it decreases, the application is informed, creating a feedback loop, so that it can adapt the stream to fit into the lower bandwidth range. If more bandwidth is available, qWave automatically reserves it and informs the application of the improvement. For probing the quality of the network, probe packets are sent to the source and statistics (such as round trip time, loss, latency jitter etc.) of their path analyzed and the results are cached. The probe is repeated after specific time intervals to update the cache. Whenever the stream is requested, the cache is looked up. qWave also serializes creation of multiple simultaneous streams, even across devices, so that probes sent for one stream are not interfered by others. qWave uses client side buffers to keep transmission rate within range of the slowest part in the network, so that the access point buffers are not overwhelmed, thus reducing packet loss. qWave works best if both the source and sink (client) of the multimedia stream are qWave aware. Also, the wireless access point (AP) needs to be QoS-enabled, supporting bandwidth reservation. It can also work without QoS-aware APs; however, since qWave cannot reserve bandwidth in this case, it has to depend on the application to adapt the stream based on the available bandwidth, which not only will be affected by network conditions, but other data in the network as well. qWave is also available for other devices as a part of the Windows Rally technologies. Network security In order to provide better security when transferring data over a network, Windows Vista provides enhancements to the cryptographic algorithms used to obfuscate data. Support for 256-bit, 384-bit and 512-bit Elliptic curve Diffie‚ÄìHellman (ECDH) algorithms, as well as for 128-bit, 192-bit and 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is included in the network stack itself. Direct support for SSL connections in new Winsock API allows socket applications to directly control security of their traffic over a network (such as providing security policy and requirements for traffic, querying security settings) rather than having to add extra code to support a secure connection. Computers running Windows Vista can be a part of logically isolated networks within an Active Directory domain. Only the computers which are in the same logical network partition will be able to access the resources in the domain. Even though other systems may be physically on the same network, unless they are in the same logical partition, they won't be able to access partitioned resources. A system may be part of multiple network partitions. Windows Vista also includes an Extensible Authentication Protocol Host (EAPHost) framework that provides extensibility for authentication methods for commonly used protected network access technologies such as 802.1X and PPP.EAPHost in Windows It allows networking vendors to develop and easily install new authentication methods known as EAP methods. A planned feature in the new TCP/IP suite known as \\"Routing Compartments\\", utilized a per-user routing table, thus compartmentalizing the network according to the user's needs, so that data from one segment would not go into another. This feature however was removed before the release of Windows Vista, and is slated to be included possibly in a future release of Windows.\\"Routing compartments\\" feature removed (Windows Server 2008 Chat Transcript) =Network Access Protection= Windows Vista also introduces Network Access Protection (NAP), which makes sure that computers connecting to a network conform to a required level of system health as has been set by the administrator of the network. With NAP enabled on a network, when a Windows Vista computer attempts to join a network, it is verified that the computer is up-to-date with security updates, virus signatures and other factors, including configuration of IPsec and 802.1x authentication settings, specified by the network administrator. It will be granted full access to the network only when the criteria are met, failing which it may be either denied access to the network or granted limited access only to certain resources. It may optionally be granted access to servers which will provide it with the latest updates. Once the updates are installed, the computer is granted access to the network. However, Windows Vista can only be a NAP client, i.e., a client computer which connects to a NAP enabled network. Health policy and verification servers have to be running Windows Server 2008. =IPsec and Windows Firewall= IPsec configuration is now fully integrated into the Windows Firewall with Advanced Security snap-in and netsh advfirewall command-line tool to prevent contradictory rules and offer simplified configuration along with an authenticating firewall. Advanced firewall filtering rules (exceptions) and IPsec policies can be set up such as by domain, public, and private profiles, source and destination IP addresses, IP address range, source and destination TCP and UDP ports, all or multiple ports, specific types of interfaces, ICMP and ICMPv6 traffic by Type and Code, services, edge traversal, IPsec protection state and specified users and computers based on Active Directory accounts. Prior to Windows Vista, setting up and maintaining IPsec policy configuration in many scenarios required setting up a set of rules for protection and another set of rules for traffic exemptions. IPsec nodes in Windows Vista communicate while simultaneously negotiating protected communications and if a response is received and negotiation completes, subsequent communications are protected. This eliminates the need to set up IPsec filters for exemptions for the set of hosts that do not or cannot support IPsec, allows setting up required incoming protected initiated communication and optional outgoing communication. IPsec also allows securing traffic between domain controllers and member computers, while still allowing clear text for domain joins and other communication types. IPsec protected domain joins are allowed if using NTLM v2 and if both, the domain controllers and member computers are running Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista respectively. IPsec fully supports IPv6, AuthIP (which allows for a second authentication), integration with NAP for authenticating with a health certificate, Network Diagnostics Framework support for failed IPsec negotiation, new IPsec performance counters, and improved detection of cluster node failure and faster renegotiation of security associations. There is support for stronger algorithms for main mode negotiation (stronger DH algorithms and Suite B) and data integrity and encryption (AES with CBC, AES- GMAC, SHA-256, AES-GCM).  Network Diagnostics Framework (NDF)  The ability to assist the user in diagnosing a network problem is expected to be a major new networking feature. There is extensive support for runtime diagnostics for both wired and wireless networks, including support for TCP Management information base (MIB)-II and better system event logging and tracing. The Vista TCP/IP stack also supports ESTATS which defines extended performance statistics for TCP and can help in determining the cause of network performance bottlenecks. Windows Vista can inform the user of most causes of network transmission failure, such as incorrect IP address, incorrect DNS and default gateway settings, gateway failure, port in use or blocked, receiver not ready, DHCP service not running, NetBIOS over TCP/IP name resolution failure etc. Transmission errors are also exhaustively logged, which can be analyzed to better find the cause of error. Windows Vista has a greater awareness of the network topology the host computer is in, using technologies such as Universal Plug and Play. With this new network awareness technology, Windows Vista can provide help to the user in fixing network issues or simply provide a graphical view of the perceived network configuration. Windows Filtering Platform The Windows Vista network stack includes Windows Filtering Platform, which allows external applications to access and hook into the packet processing pipeline of the networking subsystem. WFP allows incoming and outgoing packets to be filtered, analyzed or modified at several layers of the TCP/IP protocol stack. Because WFP has an inbuilt filtering engine, applications need not write any custom engine, they just need to provide the custom logic for the engine to use. WFP includes a Base Filtering Engine which implements the filter requests. The packets are then processed using the Generic Filtering Engine, which also includes a Callout Module, where applications providing the custom processing logic can be hooked up. WFP can be put to uses such as inspecting packets for malware, selective packet restriction, such as in firewalls, or providing custom encryption systems, among others. Upon its initial release WFP was plagued with bugs including memory leaks and race conditions. The Windows Firewall in Windows Vista is implemented through WFP. Peer-to-peer communication Windows Vista includes significant peer-to-peer support with the introduction of new APIs and protocols. A new version of the Peer Name Resolution Protocol (PNRP v2), as well as a set of Peer Distributed Routing Table, Peer Graphing, Peer Grouping, Peer Naming, and Peer Identity Management APIs are introduced. Contacts can be created and administered with the new peer-to-peer subsystem‚Äîserverless presence allows users to manage real-time presence information and track the presence of other registered users across a subnet or the Internet. A new People Near Me service allows for the discovery and management of contacts on the same subnet and uses Windows Contacts to manage and store contact information; the new capabilities allows peers to send application invitations to other peers (ad-hoc collaboration is also supported) without a centralized server. Windows Meeting Space is an example of such an application. PNRP also allows creating an overlay network called a Graph. Each peer in the overlay network corresponds to a node in the graph. All the nodes in a graph share book-keeping information responsible for the functioning of the network as a whole. For example, in a distributed resource management network, which node has what resource needs to be shared. Such information is shared as Records, which are flooded to all the peers in a graph. Each peer stores the Record to a local database. A Record consists of a header and a body. The body contains data specific to the application that is using the API; the header contains metadata to describe the data in the body as name-value pairs serialized using XML, in addition to author and version information. It can also contain an index of the body data, for fast searching. A node can connect to other nodes directly as well, for communication that need not be shared with the entire Graph. The API also allows creation of a secure overlay network called a Group, consisting of all or a subset of nodes in a Graph. A Group can be shared by multiple applications, unlike a Graph. All peers in a Group must be identifiable by a unique named, registered using PNRP, and have a digital signature certificate termed as Group Member Certificate (GMC). All Records exchanged are digitally signed. Peers must be invited into a Group. The invitation contains the GMC that enables it to join the group. A new Windows Internet Computer Names (WICN) peer networking feature allows an IPv6-connected machine to obtain a custom or unique domain name. If the computer is connected to the Internet, users can specify a secured or unsecured host name for their computer from a console command, without requiring to register a domain name and configuring a dynamic DNS. WICN can be used in any application that accepts an IP address or DNS name; PNRP performs all the domain name resolution at the peer-to-peer level. Another planned feature in Windows Vista would have provided a new domain-like networking setup known as a Castle, but this did not make it into the release. Castle would have made it possible to have an identification service, which provides user authentication, for all members on the network, without a centralized server. It would have allowed user credentials to propagate across the peer- to-peer network, making them more suitable for a home network. =People Near Me= People Near Me (formerly People Nearby) is a peer-to-peer service designed to simplify communication and collaboration among users connected to the same subnet. People Near Me is used by Windows Meeting Space for collaboration and contact discovery. People Near Me was listed as part of Microsoft's mobile platform strategy as revealed during the Windows Hardware Engineering Conference of 2004. People Near Me uses Windows Contacts to manage contact information; by default, a user may receive invitations from all users connected to the same subnet, but a user can designate another user as a trusted contact to enable collaboration across the Internet, to increase security, and to determine the presence of these contacts. Background Intelligent Transfer Service The new Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) 3.0 has a new feature called Neighbor Casting which supports peer-to- peer file transfers within a domain. This facilitates peer caching, allows users to download and serve content (such as WSUS updates) from peers on the same subnet, receive notification when a file is downloaded, access the temporary file while the download is in progress, and control HTTP redirects. This saves bandwidth on the network and reduces performance load on the server. BITS 3.0 also uses Internet Gateway Device Protocol counters to more accurately calculate available bandwidth. Core networking driver and API improvements The HTTP kernel mode driver in Windows Vista, Http.sys has been enhanced to support server-side authentication, logging, IDN hostnames, Event Tracing and better manageability through netsh http and new performance counters. WinINet, the protocol handler for HTTP and FTP handles IPv6 literal addresses, includes support for Gzip and deflate decompression to improve content encoding performance, Internationalized domain names support and Event Tracing. WinHTTP, the client API for server-based applications and services supports IPv6, AutoProxy, HTTP/1.1 chunked transfer encoding, larger data uploads, SSL and client certificates, server and proxy authentication, automatic handling of redirects and keep-alive connections and HTTP/1.0 protocol, including support for keep-alive (persistent) connections and session cookies. Winsock has been updated with new APIs and support for Event Tracing. Winsock Layered Service Provider support has been enhanced with logged installations and removals, a new API for reliably installing LSPs, a command to reliably remove LSPs, facilities to categorize LSPs and to remove most LSPs from the processing path for system critical services and support for Network Diagnostics Framework. =Winsock Kernel= Winsock Kernel (WSK) is a new transport-independent kernel-mode Network Programming Interface (NPI) that provides TDI client developers with a sockets-like programming model similar to those supported in user-mode Winsock. While most of the same sockets programming concepts exist as in user-mode Winsock such as socket, creation, bind, connect, accept, send and receive, Winsock Kernel is a completely new programming interface with unique characteristics such as asynchronous I/O that uses IRPs and event callbacks to enhance performance. TDI is supported in Windows Vista for backward compatibility. Server Message Block 2.0 A new version of the Server Message Block (SMB) protocol was introduced with Windows Vista. It has a number of changes to improve performance and add additional capabilities. Windows Vista and later operating systems use SMB 2.0 when communicating with other machines running Windows Vista or later. SMB 1.0 continues in use for connections to any previous version of Windows, or to Samba. Samba 3.6 also includes support for SMB 2.0. Remote Differential Compression Remote Differential Compression (RDC) is a client-server synchronization protocol allows data to be synchronized with a remote source using compression techniques to minimize the amount of data sent across the network. It synchronizes files by calculating and transferring only the differences between them on-the-fly. Therefore, RDC is suitable for efficient synchronization of files that have been updated independently, or when network bandwidth is small or in scenarios where the files are large but the differences between them are small. Bluetooth support The Windows Vista Bluetooth stack is improved with support for more hardware IDs, EDR performance improvements, Adaptive frequency hopping for Wi-Fi co-existence, and Synchronous Connection Oriented (SCO) protocol support which is needed for audio profiles. The Windows Vista Bluetooth stack supports a kernel mode device driver interface besides the user-mode programming interface, which enables third parties to add support for additional Bluetooth Profiles such as SCO, SDP, and L2CAP. This was lacking in the Windows XP Service Pack 2 built- in Bluetooth stack, which had to be entirely replaced by a third-party stack for additional profile support. It also provides RFCOMM support using sockets besides virtual COM ports. KB942567 called Windows Vista Feature Pack for Wireless adds Bluetooth 2.1+EDR support and remote wake from S3 or S4 support for self-powered Bluetooth modules.Bluetooth Wireless Technology FAQ This feature pack while initially only available to OEMs, was eventually included in Windows Vista Service Pack 2.  Virtual Private Networking (VPN)  * Windows Vista and later support the use of PEAP with PPTP. The authentication mechanisms supported are PEAPv0/EAP-MSCHAPv2 (passwords) and PEAP-TLS (smartcards and certificates). * Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol (SSTP), introduced in Windows Vista Service Pack 1 is a form of VPN tunnel that provides a mechanism to transport PPP or L2TP traffic through an SSL 3.0 channel. SSL provides transport-level security with key-negotiation, encryption and traffic integrity checking.

He is best known for having defended striking workers during the Auto-Lite Strike in 1934 and for successfully resisting the federal government's attempt to strip him of his broadcasting licenses during the McCarthy era. Background Lamb was born to British-born Clarence and Mary (Gross) Lamb in 1901 in Toledo, Ohio. He was one of ten children. Clarence Lamb was a commercial fisherman on Lake Erie, and Mary Lamb a housekeeper. Lamb entered Dartmouth College in 1920. He received a juris doctor degree from Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University) in 1927. He was admitted to the Ohio bar the same year. Career =Government= In 1928, he became assistant counsel for the city of Toledo. He quit public life in 1929 and opened a private practice. =Labor lawyer= In 1934, Lamb turned from corporate to labor law after workers at the Auto- Lite auto parts manufacturer asked him to represent them during the Auto-Lite Strike. \\"I knew it would finish me with the corporations I represented, but those workers were in the right and I took their case.\\" Lamb became deeply involved in the negotiations which ended the violent Auto-Lite strike, and helped to successfully negotiate a collective bargaining agreement. Lamb remained active in labor law through the 1930s and 1940s, representing more than 75 unions. He was jailed several times for contempt of court during labor union strikes. Other notable instances where Lamb represented workers were the \\"onion fields strike\\" in McGuffey, Ohio, in 1934; the Little Steel Strike in Ohio in 1937; the shoe workers' strike in Portsmouth, Ohio, in 1937; and the strike against the U.S. Gypsum Company in Port Clinton, Ohio, in 1938. During the shoe workers' strike, corporate attorneys initiated disbarment proceedings against Lamb for his aggressive defense of trade union members. The disbarment proceeding was unsuccessful. Lamb won a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case in 1946. In Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 328 U.S. 680 (1946), the Supreme Court held that workers were entitled to pay for required preliminary duties after arriving at the places of work, if the employer made them wait before and after the shift periods, and for time spent in walking from time clocks to their places of work. The decision subsequently became known as the \\"portal to portal case.\\" =Associations= In the 1930s, Lamb was a member of the International Juridical Association. =Broadcasting= Increasingly wealthy from a series of stock investments, Lamb began buying newspapers and television and radio stations in the 1940s. Picture Waves, Inc., a Lamb-owned affiliate, was awarded the license for WTVN-TV (now WSYX) in Columbus, Ohio and the station began broadcasting in 1949.See WTVN-TV Promotional Materials, no date, accessed April 28, 2007. Pictures of Lamb are throughout these materials. He also owned several media interests in Erie, Pennsylvania; including the now-defunct Erie Dispatch Herald newspaper and WICU-AM-TV. He nearly lost his Erie stations in a bitter legal battle with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). When the station's license came up for renewal in 1954, the FCC tried to get Lamb to surrender his broadcasting license on grounds that he associated with communists. Lamb fought for the right to hold the license, and won his case in 1957. =Investments= Lamb also owned more than 55 manufacturing and financial concerns (including Nevada National Bancorporation, later part of Security Pacific Bank). One of his largest businesses was the Seiberling Rubber Co. Lamb fought a losing proxy fight for control over the company in 1956, but seized control after another shareholder battle in 1962. =Trustee= In his later years, Lamb was a trustee of the United Nations Association chapter in the United States, and participated in peace and civil rights demonstrations in the 1960s. He was also a trustee of the Fund for the Republic, a civil rights organization which was absorbed by the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in 1979. He was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto. Lamb's company changed its name to Great Lakes Communications after selling off all of his interests outside of Erie. He continued to serve as president and chairman until his death in 1987. Personal and death Lamb and his wife, Prudence had two children: Priscilla Lamb Schwier and Edward Lamb. He died on March 23, 1987, at his home in Maumee, Ohio. Legacy His wife and children survived him, and continued to operate WICU-TV until selling it in 1996. His estate endowed the Edward Lamb Foundation of Maumee, Ohio (also listed as Perrysburg, Ohio). References External sources *Bernstein, Irving.

It was written by John Vornholt in 1998. Plot The book begins with Ro Laren, former Enterprise-D crew member (recurring character played by Michelle Forbes in Star Trek: The Next Generation) turned Maquis officer taking command of a ship in the hopes of heading to Federation lines to safety. They soon run into trouble when they are attacked by Jem'Hadar attack craft. Another Starfleet ship, the Aurora comes to assist, but it is no use. Both ships send distress calls, and one ship comes to their aid: the Enterprise-E. As this is happening, in a distant galaxy, another former Enterprise crewman witnesses the destruction of a Cardassian mining craft as he is herded onto a Dominion space station. The space station not only houses prisoners of war, but also serves as a base of operations as the Dominion attempts to construct an artificial wormhole. Sam Lavelle finds Taurik, yet another former crewman, also being herded into the station up to the male prisoners compound. Upon entering, Sam is berated for agreeing to be the Liaison Officer of their pod, but he is \\"rescued\\" by the call of the Vorta in command of the station, and upon entering a ball, is confronted by a Founder, with the message that he is to be given command of a ship. On his crew are Taurik, and the mastermind of the whole wormhole operation, Enrak Grof, a Trill who values his work over alliances. The Enterprise enters the battle and rescues the Bajoran transport, but unfortunately the Aurora is destroyed in the battle. Captain Jean-Luc Picard learns of the wormhole's construction, and prepares to take Laren, Chief Engineer Geordi La Forge, and a small crew in an attempt to destroy it. The crew disembarks, and after some encounters with Cardassians, Jem'Hadar, Ferengi, and Romulans, they reach the wormhole. Using a tractor beam, they attempt to send thousands of small asteroids careening into it, but instead decide to destroy the mining craft and apparently halt any chance of completing the wormhole. They prepare to fire but learn that the craft is actually full of Federation prisoners. They save the prisoners and destroy the craft. Upon returning home, they learn from Grof that their ship was not the only one sent to mine the metal, meaning that the wormhole still could be completed.

Since Malaysia comprises three major cultures: Malay, Chinese and Indian, each culture has its own traditional and religious articles of clothing all of which are gender specific and may be adapted to local influences and conditions. Malay Traditional Malay attire for men is the baju melayu, a loose tunic which is worn over trousers and usually accompanied with a sarong called a sampin which is wrapped around the hips. It is also often accompanied with a songkok or kopiah http://www.sabah.edu.my/itsr039/malays.htm Malay women wear the baju kurung. Originally, the term \\"baju kurung\\" referred to both the men's and women's attire. The older definition is still maintained in Singapore. The clothing for Baju Kurung are: knee-length blouse worn over a long skirt. The blouse is long-sleeved and collarless, while the skirt, called a kain, has pleats on one side.http://www.pahang-delights.com/baju-kurung.html A headscarf is sometimes worn with this. Another popular traditional costume is the kebaya, a more tight-fitting two-piece dress. This is often considered less formal.http://www.moe.gov.my/upload/galeri_awam/pekeliling/2007_BTMK_28_6645_4984.pdf It is worn by the female flight attendants of Malaysia Airlines. Prior to the wide embrace of Islam, Malay women wore \\"kemban\\", which were sarongs tied just above the chest. Chinese The Chinese women wear the cheongsam, a one-piece dress with a high collar, diagonally closed with small clips or toggles (fabric clasps). It sometimes can have slits at the side, as is made with a soft fabric such as silk. The cheongsam is especially popular around the time of the Chinese New Year and other formal gatherings (the fourth and fifth women from the right in the picture above). Older well-respected women wear a samfoo, which looks like pajamas with a separate loose fitting top fastened by toggles and ankle length, or above the ankle, pants. Indian Indians in Malaysia as with elsewhere in the world wear sarees, a cloth of 5-6 yards which is usually worn with a petticoat of a similar shade. It is wrapped around the body so that the embroidered end hangs over the shoulder, while the petticoat is worn above the bellybutton to support the saree, which can be made from a wide variety of materials. The Punjabi Salwar kameez is popular with women from northern India, and is a long tunic worn over trousers with a matching shawl. The fabric imported from India, made of the best quality silk is used in making saris. There are two layers to a sari: a long bright coloured \\"dress\\" decorated with colourful beads sewn on it to make it look more attractive, and a wrap, a piece of straight fabric draped around one shoulder which ties across the body around the waist area. Women with a high standing will have their clothing made from gold and silver thread with elaborate beading. In formal occasions Indian men wear the \\"kurta\\", a knee- length shirt usually made from cotton or linen. The Indian men wear Sherwani, Lungi, Dhoti and Kurta-Pajama.The Sherwani: a coat like garment fitted close to the body, of knee-length or longer and opening in front with button- fastenings. Below the men wear a garment for the lower part of the body, baggy and wide at the top tied with a string at the waist, and tight around the legs and ankles. The Lungi: The traditional lungi originated in the south and today it is worn by men and women alike. It is simply a short length of material worn around the thighs rather like a sarong. The Dhoti: The most ancient recorded Indian drape is a dhoti. They require a piece of cloth which seems longer and larger than what was worn in the past, but their pleating is often simpler, and they are not adorned with belts any more. All dhotis begin with the same basic closing. It is the only drape that doesn't start from one pallav but from the centre of the upper border. The middle of the cloth is tied around the hips. Each end of the cloth is then draped around the leg on its side. The Kurta-Pyjama: The Kurta or the top is a knee length colarless shirt which is adorned inmostly white or pastel colours. But today you will find Kurtas made out of the most wonderful and colourful of fabrics. Pyjama- are like loose trousers with a string tie at the waist. Traditionally white in colour. Indigenous Before the creation of ancient kingdoms, most aboriginal people wore bark costumes decorated with beads. In the times of early kingdoms hand-crafted textiles were used, and trade from other areas brought other outfits such as silk costumes, pulicats and sarongs, and jubbahs. The Orang Asli still wear clothing of natural materials, often out of treebark and skirt. Leaf fronds are sometimes crafted into headbands or other ornaments. In East Malaysia similar clothes are worn. The Orang Ulu wear hand- loomed cloths as well as tree bark fabrics. Beads and feathers are used for decoration. The Iban are known for their woven \\"pua kumbu\\". Another well known clothing item is the \\"songket\\" of the Sarawak Malay. In Sabah the clothing of different tribes differs with different amounts, with tribes in close proximity having similar clothing. Notable ones are the Kadazan-Dusun straw hats for ladies, the \\"dastar\\" of the Bajau. Men from the Lotud tribe wear a headdress which has a number of fold points equal to the number of his wives. Others Old Chinese immigrants who married Malays and adopted some of their culture are known as the Baba Nyonya or Peranakan Chinese. They wear \\"kebaya\\", which are hard-made lace-like trimmed clothing, often with intricate embroidery. Those descended from the Portuguese often wear Portuguese-style outfits. Men often wear jackets and trousers with waist sashes, while women wear broad front-layered skirts. The dominant colours are black and red. And also Kadazan Glossary Baju Kurung Kedah ‚Äì worn only by Malay women as a daily dress for married women. it is a shorter dress with three-quarter sleeves, so the wearer can move around easily. Baju Batik ‚Äì worn by men and women on a formal occasion. Usually colourful cotton printed in the batik or wax resist method of dyeing. Baju Melayu ‚Äì worn by Malay men, it does not have any buttons but has a special kind of button called a butang. The fabric used to make a baju melayu is made from either nylon, satin, or silk. Along with this is a songkok or kopiah, worn on the head. Songkok are generally a dark natural colour, and the kopiah is a white colour and represents purity. Baju Kurung ‚Äì a baju kurung is worn by women for occasions such as school (as a uniform) or to a wedding. It too is brightly coloured and can come in a variety of different printed designs. It is a knee length dress with a full length sleeves. Baju Kebarung ‚Äì is a combination of the baju kebaya and the baju kurung. It is loose and almost reaches the ankles; it is not one of the traditional clothes of the Malay, but an adaptation.

The earliest wardrobe was a chest, and it was not until some degree of luxury was attained in regal palaces and the castles of powerful nobles that separate accommodation was provided for the apparel of the great. The name of wardrobe was then given to a room in which the wall-space was filled with closets and lockers, the drawer being a comparatively modern invention. From these cupboards and lockers the modern wardrobe, with its hanging spaces, sliding shelves and drawers, evolved slowly. Throughout the chronological changes in the form of the enclosure, it more or less retained its preset function as a place to retain a king‚Äôs robe. The word has gained coinage over successive generations as an independent store for among others, preserving precious items for a ruler like gold, well highlighted in King Edward I's times. It is also a simple patio where clothes are hung from metal bars or tucked inside utility racks running from up to down. The modern wardrobe differs in one respect from the historical one for its triple partitioning: there are two linear compartments on either side with shelves as well as a middle space made up of hanging pegs and drawers, the latter being a latter-day addition, besides a clothes‚Äô press in the higher central space on level with a person‚Äôs chest. Additionally, an armoire is a wardrobe that is wider than a grown adult's arm span, while a wardrobe is smaller. Etymology The word wardrobe appeared in the English language in the early 14th century. It originated from Old French words warderobe, wardereube and garderobe, in which \\"warder\\" meant \\"to keep, to guard\\" and \\"robe\\" meant \\"garment\\". History tallboy with under-cabinet instead of a chest of drawers Chinese Ming Dynasty compound wardrobe made of rosewood, latter half of the 16th century In the United States, the wardrobe in its moveable form as an oak \\"hanging cupboard\\" dates back to the early 17th century. At that time it was an early export product from America to England, because English woodlands were over-harvested or reserved for the Navy. Consequently, the item was sometimes referred to as an oakley. For probably a hundred years, such pieces, massive and cumbrous in form, but often with well-carved fronts, were produced in moderate numbers; then the gradual diminution in the use of oak for cabinet-making produced a change of fashion in favor of the more plentiful American walnut. (The virgin American forests became successively Oak, then Maple with successive deforestation episodes.) Walnut succeeded oak as the favourite material for furniture, but hanging wardrobes in walnut appear to have been made very rarely, although clothes presses, with drawers and sliding trays, were frequent. During a large portion of the 18th century, the tallboy was much used for storing clothes. =Size= A common feature was to base future size on the eight small men method. A considered good size double wardrobe would thus be able to hold within its capacity, eight small men. A modern fitted wardrobe In the nineteenth century, the wardrobe began to develop into its modern form, with a hanging cupboard at each side, a press in the upper part of the central portion, and drawers below. As a rule, it was often of mahogany, but as satinwood and other previously scarce, fine-grained, foreign woods began to be obtainable in considerable quantities, many elaborately and even magnificently inlaid wardrobes were made. Where Chippendale and his school had carved, Sheraton, Hepplewhite and their contemporaries achieved their effects by the artistic employment of deftly contrasted and highly polished woods. The next to last step in the evolution of the wardrobe was taken when the central doors, which had previously enclosed merely the upper part, were carried to the floor, covering the drawers as well as the sliding shelves, and were often fitted with mirrors. In the United Kingdom, a more affluent option is custom-fitted wardrobes, which are built around the size and shape of the room. Kas style Kas, early 19th century, Brooklyn Museum (New York City) Kas, kast, or kasten (pronounced kaz) is a massive cupboard or wardrobe of Dutch origin similar to an armoire that was popular in the Netherlands and America in the 17th & 18th centuries. It was fitted with shelves and drawers used to store linen, clothing, and other valuables and locked by key. They were status symbols and family heirlooms in the Low Countries and imported luxury goods to the American colonies. As such they were often made of quality wood such as cherry, rosewood and ebony that were paneled, carved or painted.

It is accessible by air all year and by waterway in summer and ice roads in winter. As of December 2009, the First Nation had a total registered population of 500 people, the on-reserve population being 462. The community speaks the Oji-Cree language, but most of it is fluent in English as well. The police that serve Kingfisher Lake are the Nishnawbe-Aski Police Service, an Aboriginal-based service. History In 1808 the Hudson's Bay Company established an outpost at Big Beaver House, located approximately 12 kilometres southwest of the present Kingfisher Lake reserve. Big Beaver House was frequented by Kingfisher Lake people for trading fur, community activity and freight hauling employment. In 1929 to 1930, the leaders of Kingfisher Lake First Nation were required to gather at Big Trout Lake to participate in the signing of the adhesion to Treaty 9. As the result, Kingfisher Lake was considered a part of Big Trout Lake Band. In 1947, Ontario enacted the Trapline Registration and Fee Program, which eventually forced the Kingfisher Lake people to outline their ancestral hunting areas into trapping boundaries and also to pay for the land use requirements. In 1964, the leaders of Kingfisher Lake decided to establish permanent community and to move to the current location of the reserve lands. As Kingfisher Lake was already included in the Big Trout Lake Band and so had reserve status, the formality of gaining band status was achieved in 1975. In 2011, many of the residents were temporarily housed in Ottawa because of forest fires in the surrounding area.  Governance  Aerial view of Kingfisher Lake, with the community of Kingfisher Lake in bottom left.

The earliest known kiln was built at the base of Mt. Takatori in Chikuzen between 1600 and 1606. Over the course of the seventeenth century, the site of Takatori production moved five times. In 1716, the workshop and kiln were moved to the Nishijin area west of the Kuroda castle at Fukuoka; there production remained until the abolition of the domain system in 1871. Later, probably in the nineteenth century, the Takatori style became known as one of the Seven Famous Kilns of Enshu, which made wares following the preferences of the tea ceremony master Kobori Ensh≈´.

He was the eighth child of Whiting Meigs and Charlotte (Grennell) Meigs. He received his common school education there and then ventured to Newark, New Jersey, Brooklyn, New York, Key West, Florida, Memphis, Tennessee and New Orleans, Louisiana. He ultimately went to California during the gold rush of 1849, where he opened a lumber business in San Francisco. In 1854, Meigs purchased a lumber mill from J.J. Felt who had moved it from Appletree Cove, near the present city of Kingston, Washington to a new location at Port Madison, on Bainbridge Island. The mill was located near the Suquamish longhouse Old Man House, and many workers in the mill were Natives. Port Madison was founded by Meigs. Meigs enlarged and improved the mill and spent most of his time there, leaving the lumber yard in San Francisco to William H. Gawley. By 1858, Meigs had developed a capacity at the mill of 15,000 board feet (35 m¬≥) per day and it soon ranked with the principal lumber producing plants on Puget Sound. In addition to the lumber mill, Meigs established a dairy farm near the middle of Bainbridge Island. In 1858, Meigs married Mary Elizabeth Tappan, daughter of Charles Ogden Tappan, in Boston, Massachusetts. The couple had two children, Lillie Charlotte Meigs (1859‚Äì1927) and George Elroy Meigs (1861‚Äì1870). Meigs was a friend of Chief Seattle, who requested that Meigs shake his hand before he was laid in the ground. Meigs later built the first brass and iron foundry in Washington Territory and a shipyard. From his shipyard came the first full-rigged sailing ship ever built on the Pacific Coast, the Wildwood. Although there was an abundant supply of timber on the coast, the Pacific shipbuilding industry had been held back by the fact that Douglas fir, the principal timber source, was found to decay rapidly. Not until it was discovered that Douglas fir was durable if cut in the winter, seasoned and salted was any attempt made to construct ships of it. The Wildwood, at 1099 tons, was the first. Meigs assisted in the construction of the University of Washington and served as one of its regents during the early 1860s. On February 18, 1861, a boiler explosion made a wreck of Meigs' Puget Sound mill. Five men were killed, and the cost of rebuilding just about broke Meigs. In 1864, the mill burned once more and the loss was put at $100,000. Again, Meigs rebuilt and enlarged the mill's capacity. During the first six months of 1870, running day and night, the mill cut and shipped 11,872,000 board feet (28,000 m¬≥) of lumber. Meigs' fleet of ships had also expanded to 45,000 tons, including the Northern and Tidal Wave. Meigs weathered business depressions and other problems, including his partner's, William H. Gawley's, speculation with funds taken from the company. Finally, by 1881, financial and legal difficulties could not be overcome and the mill complex on Bainbridge Island was sold at a sheriff's auction. Meigs spent the last years of life on his property at Port Madison. On March 3, 1897, Meigs had gone to testify in a libel action in Seattle, Washington. On his way back to the ship, which was to leave that night for Port Madison, Meigs disappeared. His body was found the next morning on the deck of a freighter. The coroner's jury held that Meigs had gotten lost in the dark and his death was accidental. References * Bowden, A.B. Early Schools of Washington Territory, 1935. * Cox, Thomas R.

CalCars (also known as The California Cars Initiative) was a charitable, non-profit organization founded in 2002 to promote plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) as a key to addressing oil dependence and global warming both nationally and internationally.See Chapter 2. Reinventing the car. See Chapter 3. Felix Flirts with Hydrogen. http://www.sherryboschert.com/?page_id=607 It was active until 2010, when the first mass-produced PHEVs arrived. CalCars envisioned millions of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, charged by off-peak electricity from renewable energy sources, and with their internal combustion engines powered by low- carbon alternative fuels, as a way to significantly reduce greenhouse gases that come from transportation.  History  Lithium-ion battery pack, with cover removed, in CalCars' plug-in hybrid converted Toyota Prius, which was the first PHEV based on the Prius and called PRIUS+. With co-sponsorship from Hypercar, Felix Kramer organized what became the founding meeting of the California Car Company Initiative on July 29, 2002 in Palo Alto, CA, which evolved into the non-profit California Cars Initiative, and shifted its focus from hydrogen fuel cells to the nearer-term plug-in hybrid. The focus was on a solution using existing technology and 120-volt household power rather than a new infrastructure. CalCars announced its dual approach of technical demonstration of feasibility and advocacy to reach \\"influencers\\" and decision- makers. Having recruited engineer Ron Gremban as Technology Lead and begun an open source Prius Plus conversion program,See PriusPlus.org CalCars completed the first Prius conversion in 2004. In 2006, with a conversion by one of the independent conversion companies, Kramer became the \\"world's first non- technical consumer owner\\" of a PHEV.Where PHEVs Are\\" He flew that vehicle to Washington DC in May 2006 for the first public viewing of a PHEV on Capitol Hill.See CalCars' \\"PHEVs in DC.\\" CalCars worked with allied organizations to build buyer demand for PHEVs in the United States and promote commercial production of plug-in hybrid vehicles by major automakers. It engaged in public education through its web site calcars.org. It displayed its + PHEVs at public and private events, showed promotional videos, and makes presentations to different audiences, including political leaders and opinion-makers. CalCars also promoted technology development for PHEVs by building example plug-in hybrid vehicles, and maintaining open-source documentation of technological information about its prototypes. In its technology development, CalCars was closely linked with the work of Professor Andrew A. (Andy) Frank and the Team Fate design group at the University of California, Davis.Dr. Andrew A. Frank, Director, http://www.team-fate.net advanced hybrid vehicle research center (which has built 9 plug-in hybrid proof-of-concept vehicles), Professor, University of California at Davis; see a 2003 interview in EVWorld, part 1 and part 2 and a 2006 Wall Street Journal profile. After the first handful of Prius+ conversions, the PHEVs were displayed at multiple locations and events around the country, including the US Congress. Interest in the PHEV concept swelled, and building conversion kits for DIYers or commercial conversions took off as many small and large companies entered the space. Calcars worked closely with journalists and the media to further stoke interest. Dozens of books on the topic were released and reviewed by Calcars. CalCars tracked and commented on continuing developments through its listserv from 2005‚Äì2013. The CC automakers page covered the numerous developments announced by automakers, and CalCars' analysis of them. It further promoted PHEVs with leaders everywhere by featuring photos of them with their vehicles on its \\"Influencers\\" and \\"leaders\\". CalCars worked to connect PHEV owners to automakers, and welcomed GM's announcement of the Volt. An attempt was made to get companies to offer aftermarket conversions for most existing vehicles on the road, but little success was had in getting aftermarket converters to form a trade group to secure government incentives for conversions. So after several years the conversion market shrank, and currently has one provider, Plug-in Supply. In November 2009, Calcars declared a preliminary victory, with mass-produced PHEVs and fully electric vehicles set to arrive shortly. Drivers and advocates were migrated to the Electric Auto Association (EEA), Plug In America (PIA), or the Sierra Club for further promotion of CalCars goal of rapidly electrifying all vehicles. Several plug-in hybrid converted Toyota Prius at Professorville, Palo Alto. CalCars built the first PRIUS+ conversion creating the first PHEV based on the 2004 Toyota Prius.The PRIUS+ was CalCars first PHEV Prius, its homepage can be found at http://www.calcars.org/priusplus.html, Photos, Commercializing Plug-In Hybrids presentation (2MB PDF) This initial conversion was done with a lead-acid battery pack to prove the concept would work. The build team included Ron Gremban, Felix Kramer, Marc Geller, Kevin Lyons, Andrew Lawton. Others who helped included Tom Driscoll, Michael Geller, Richard Jesch, Les Montavon, Dan Putman, Michael Schwabe, Len Tramiel, Bob Westman, Doug Widney.  Conversions  Prius+ (also written Prius Plus) became the open-source standard on which most plug-in hybrid kits were based. Plug-in hybrid kit manufacturers included: A123 Hymotion, Amberjac Systems, based on EDrive Systems emerged from the original EnergyCS, EETrex, Enginer, Hybrid Electric Vehicle Technologies, Plug-In Conversions Corp, Plug-In Supply (still operating), MD- Tech Beginning in 2008, CalCars started to address the problem that the rate of market penetration (as a percentage of new vehicles into the national and international fleet) would be remarkably slow, even with optimistic assumptions. To accelerate the electrification of transportation and all of its consequent benefits, CalCars started an unsuccessful initiative: spurring the growth of a new industry that converts existing internal combustion engine vehicles into plug-ins.  Combustion vehicle mass conversions  CalCars stated that compared to crushing old vehicles, converting millions of gas- guzzling, internal combustion engine vehicles (pickup trucks, SUVs, and full- size vans -PSVs-) would be a winning energy-saving strategy.  Key CalCars personnel  Toyota Prius plug-in hybrid converted by CalCars exhibited at the Maker Fair 2008, San Mateo, California. Calcars has supported the new wave of mass production plug-in electric vehicles, including the Chevrolet Volt (shown), the Nissan Leaf, and other PEVs.

It is based on the short story \\"A Man Called Horse\\" by the Western writer Dorothy M. Johnson, first published in 1950 in Collier's magazine and again in 1968 in Johnson's book Indian Country. The basic story was used in a 1958 episode of the television series Wagon Train, titled \\"A Man Called Horse\\". The film stars Richard Harris as the titular character, alongside Judith Anderson, Jean Gascon, Manu Tupou, Corinna Tsopei, Dub Taylor, and James Gammon. Partially spoken in Sioux, the film tells the story of an English aristocrat who is captured by the Sioux people. The film was a Mexican-American co-production filmed on location in Arizona and the Mexican states of Durango and Sonora. It received generally positive critical reviews, and was a financial success, spawning two sequels; The Return of a Man Called Horse (1976) and Triumphs of a Man Called Horse (1983). Plot English aristocrat John Morgan is captured, enslaved, and treated like an animal by a Native American tribe. He comes to respect his captors' culture and gain their respect. He is aided in understanding the Sioux by another captive, Batise, the tribe's half-breed fool, who had tried to escape and was hamstrung behind both knees. Determining that his only chance of freedom is to gain the respect of the tribe, he overcomes his repugnance and kills two warriors from the neighboring enemy Shoshone tribe, which allows him to claim warrior status. After his victory, he proposes marriage to one of the women with the horses taken in battle as bride-price and undergoes painful initiation rites, taking the native name \\"Shunkawakan\\" (or \\"Horse\\") as his Sioux name. When one of the warriors takes a vow never to retreat in battle, Morgan's changing perspective is shown, as he turns angrily on the uncomprehending Batise, telling him, \\"Five years you've lived here, and you've learned nothing about these people ‚Äì all his death is to you is a means of escape.\\" After successfully helping to fend off an attack by the enemy tribe, he becomes a respected member of the tribe and ultimately their leader.

Sequels Two sequels to the original movie were made, both with Harris reprising his role: * The Return of a Man Called Horse (1976) * Triumphs of a Man Called Horse (1983) Representation of cultures The film notably treats both sides dispassionately, from the view of neither the White man nor the American Indian nations, but encompassing both cultures, but some Indian activists criticized the film harshly. Buffy Sainte Marie said: > \\"Even the so-called authentic movies like A Man Called Horse ‚Äî that's the > whitest of movies I've ever seen.\\" Vine Deloria, Jr. said: > \\"As we learned from movies like A Man Called Horse, the more 'accurate' and > 'authentic' a film is said to be, the more extravagant it is likely to be in > at least some aspects of its misrepresentation of Indians.\\"Quoted in It was the first American Western to attempt to portray the Sioux as the protagonists and eulogize their culture, but fell short with Native American audiences because it still had leading White actors as the main characters for the film to appeal to White audiences. DVD A Man Called Horse was released to DVD by Paramount Home Entertainment on 29 April 2003 as a Region 1 widescreen DVD and on 31 May 2011 as a Blu-ray disc.

It was distributed by Screen Gems. Set in Portland, Oregon, the film involves a serial killer who rigs contraptions that kill his victims based on the number of hits received by a website KillWithMe.com that features a live streaming video of the victim. Millions of people log on, hastening the victims' deaths. Plot Special Agent Jennifer Marsh (Diane Lane) is a widowed single parent living in a suburban Portland home with her daughter, Annie Haskins (Perla Haney-Jardine), and her mother, Stella Marsh (Mary Beth Hurt). At night, she works in the FBI's cybercrime division with Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks), fighting identity theft and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called KillWithMe.com. The site features a streaming video of a cat being tortured and killed. The website cannot be shut down, as the creator knew that someone would try and built into it a fail-safe; every time the server is closed, a mirror server immediately replaces it. After the cat's death, KillWithMe.com's webmaster graduates to human victims, kidnapping them and placing them in death traps that are progressively activated by the number of hits the website receives. The first victim is a helicopter pilot (bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), followed by a newscaster (burnt to death by heat lamps while cemented into the floor). At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid the website, but as Jennifer feared this only increases the site's popularity. Griffin is kidnapped after investigating a lead based on his hunch as to the killer's identity and receiving a phone call from the killer disguising his voice and posing as one of Griffin's jilted blind dates. In the killer's basement, he is submerged up to his neck in a vat of water with his mouth taped shut; the death trap introduces into the water a concentration of sulfuric acid. After the killer leaves the room, Griffin uses his dying moments to blink a message in morse code, giving the FBI the lead he was following up on. Jennifer follows up on the morse code message to discover that the victims were not random: they were involved in broadcasting or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable techno prodigy son, Owen Reilly (Joseph Cross), broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When released, he decided to take revenge and prove a point: that the public's interest in the suffering of others is insatiable, as well as to wreak vengeance on those he felt had exploited his father's death. The police raid Owen's house but he is not present. Owen has been following Jennifer because he is now obsessed with her. He captures and places Jennifer in a makeshift death trap: hanging her above a cultivator and progressively lowering her to her death as more people enter the website. Jennifer escapes by swinging out of the way and grabbing a pillar to pull herself onto the ground. She breaks free and pins down the murderer, fatally shooting Owen as the police arrive. Owen's death was being broadcast, just like his father. Jennifer then displays her FBI badge to the webcam. While the chatter in the website's chat room dwindles, statements are made such as \\"You go girl!\\", \\"glad the killer is dead\\" and another one saying \\"a genius died today\\". The final comment asks whether the video could be downloaded.

A temporary studio was constructed in Clackamas, Oregon, where all non-location photography was done, mostly interiors, including the FBI's cyber division, Jennifer Marsh's house, the FBI building elevator, several basements, etc. A scene set on the east end of the Broadway Bridge was shot both on the actual bridge as well as at the studio. A faux diner was built underneath the Broadway bridge, which was used in the movie. The birthday party for Perla Haney-Jardine's character Annie was filmed in the roller skating rink of Oaks Amusement Park.  Reception  = Critical response = Untraceable received negative reviews from critics. Review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 16% based on 149 reviews, with the site's consensus being, \\"Despite Diane Lane's earnest effort, Untraceable manages to be nothing more than a run-of-the-mill thriller with a hypocritical message\\". Several critics viewed the film as hypocritical for indulging in the \\"torture porn\\" it condemns. It also met criticism for its climax which was seen as devolving into horror film clich√©s. Lane was praised for her performance in the film. Roger Ebert gave the film a favorable review, giving the film a 3 star rating. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film a strongly negative review, giving it zero stars. = Box office = The film opened poorly, with an opening weekend of $11.3 million, below the $35 million budget. It grossed $51.8 million worldwide, on theatrical release.  Home media  On May 13, 2008, Untraceable was released on DVD, Blu-ray and UMD. The DVD included an audio commentary and four featurettes.

An instrumental version of the song is heard in an episode of TV's The Honeymooners when Alice turns to Ralph and says: \\"I loved you ever since the day I walked in your bus and you shortchanged me.\\" The song is also used in the musical The 1940's Radio Hour; however, it was not included in the 2015 Broadway musical An American in Paris.  Composition  \\"Love Is Here to Stay\\" was the last musical composition George Gershwin completed before his death on July 11, 1937. Ira Gershwin wrote the lyrics after George's death as a tribute to his brother. Although George had not written a verse for the song, he did have an idea for it that both Ira and pianist Oscar Levant had heard before his death. When a verse was needed, Ira and Levant recalled what George had in mind. Composer Vernon Duke reconstructed the music for the verse at the beginning of the song. Originally titled \\"It's Here to Stay\\" and then \\"Our Love Is Here to Stay,\\" the song was finally published as \\"Love Is Here to Stay.\\" Ira Gershwin said that for years he wanted to change the song's name back to \\"Our Love Is Here to Stay,\\" but he felt it wouldn't be right since the song had already become a standard.  The Goldwyn Follies  Ira Gershwin recalled, \\"So little footage was given to 'Love Is Here to Stay' ‚Äî I think only one refrain ‚Äî that it meant little in The Goldwyn Follies.\\" Oscar Levant remembers the producer for the film calling Gershwin into a conference one afternoon and insisting that he play the entire score for a panel of attendees. The experience infuriated George, who thought that he had progressed past this stage in his career as a composer. S. N. Behrman visited Gershwin a few days before he died and wrote that George told him, \\"I had to live for this ‚Äî that Sam Goldwyn should say to me, 'Why don't you write hits like Irving Berlin?'\\" Other versions * Ella Fitzgerald and Louis Armstrong ‚Äì Ella and Louis Again (1957) * Ella Fitzgerald ‚Äì Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Songbook (1959) * Billie Holiday ‚Äì All or Nothing at All (1959) * Susannah McCorkle ‚Äì Hearts and Minds (2000) * Red Norvo with Mildred Bailey ‚Äì (1938) * Dinah Washington ‚Äì In the Land of Hi-Fi (1956) * Bradley Walsh ‚Äì Chasing Dreams (2016)http://www.bradleywalsh.co.uk/chasing- dreams/ * Frank Sinatra - Songs For Swingin' Lovers (1956) * Pat Boone and Shirley Boone ‚Äì I Love You Truly (1962)Cast Album Recordings: \\"I Love You Truly\\" Pat & Shirley Boone\\"Shirley Boone Passes\\" * Ray Charles ‚Äì I'm All Yours Baby!

He finished 65th in the 18 km event at the 1948 Winter Olympics in St. Moritz, and finished 57th in the same event at the 1952 Winter Olympics in Oslo. He was a member of the United States Ski Team from 1947 to 1954. Biography Broomhall was born in Mexico, Maine, and became a member of the Chisholm Ski Club in the 1930s. During World War II, he served in the 10th Mountain Division. Broomhall is the designer for the cross country trails for both the 1960 Winter Olympics at Squaw Valley, California and the 1980 Winter Olympics at Lake Placid, New York, and also served as chief of competition both times. In 1960, Broomhall was the first to use mechanized equipment to groom the trails, a job previously performed by feet and handheld rakes. This was made necessary because of the icy conditions caused by afternoon sun melting the snow followed by cold nights. Broomhall has donated of land to the Chisholm Ski Club, used to create skiing facilities in the Rumford area after returning from World War II. These efforts culminated in the formation of Black Mountain of Maine, which opened in 1962. He designed the cross-country trails there as well, now named Broomhall Stadium. The site has since hosted numerous national cross-country skiing championships, and Broomhall remains involved. Broomhall was inducted into the National Ski Hall of Fame in 1981, and was an inaugural member of the Maine Ski Hall of Fame when it was founded in 2003. In 2007, Black Mountain started a new annual tournament for Maine collegiate skiers, named the Chummy Broomhall Cup in his honor.

Also known by his nickname One Pound Jimmy, he became the first Aboriginal person to be featured on an Australian postage stamp. Early life Tjungurrayi was born in the Tanami Desert of the Northern Territory, 200 kilometres north-west of Alice Springs, in the region surrounding Coniston Station around 1895. His first name Gwoja means water. His last name reflects his skin name that was Tjungurrayi. As pastoralism expanded in the region during the early 1900s, encroaching further into Tjungurrayi's ancestral country, tensions intensified during the drought of the 1920s, with increasing competition over water and food. He survived the Coniston Massacre in the then Territory of Central Australia in 1928, although accounts of his survival differ: > One claimed his father was taken prisoner by Constable Murray, escaped and > fled with his family to the Arltunga region east of Alice Springs. Another > described Tjungurrayi 'worm[ing] his way out from among the dead and dying' > at Yurrkuru to 'narrowly escape death from a hail of rifle fire poured at > him by men'. > > Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri's oral account of his stepfather‚Äôs capture and > evasion records that a mounted policeman arrested and chained him up before > 'carry him 'round to show‚Äôm every soakage. They leave him... tied up on a > tree, big chain... they put leg chain too... Then everybody go out and shoot > all the people... They come back and see him ‚Äì nothing! This chain he > broke‚Äôm with a big rock and he take off... to mine ...‚Äô. After the massacre, Tjungurrayi spent time in Alyawarre country near Arltunga before settling at Napperby. Tjungurrayi made and sold boomerangs, that he sold for one pound each. Some sources claim this is where the nickname 'One Pound Jimmy' comes from. Whenever asked how much one of his pieces were, he would answer \\"One pound, boss\\". In the 1930s, Tjungurrayi and his family lived near the rations depot near Jay Creek. They trapped dingoes, selling their skins to the depot. They later moved to Hamilton Downs Station. Tjungurrayi as a National Symbol The Walkabout cover featuring One Pound Jimmy Tjungurrayi came to public attention when photographer Roy Dunstan took a striking portrait of him in 1935, under the instruction of a young tourism executive from Melbourne, Charles H Holmes, who described the encounter: > \\"During a visit to the Spotted Tiger mica mine out east of Alice Springs, I > once met as fine a specimen of aboriginal manhood as you would wish to see. > Tall and lithe, with a particularly well-developed torso, broad fore head, > strong features and the superb carriage of the unspoiled primitive native, > he rejoiced under the name of 'One Pound Jimmy.'\\" The image was used as the cover of Walkabout magazine in 1936. It drew such a response that the magazine's editors requested that Tjungurrayi be rewarded by the Department of Internal Affairs, with a gift of camping equipment, including a camp oven. Over the next few decades, the pictured photograph and others taken during their meeting featured in magazines and early Central Australian tourism campaigns. Holmes claimed he used the images repeatedly presenting Jimmy as a 'symbol of a vanishing race'. Now internationally recognised, people regularly travelled to Central Australia seeking Tjungurrayi's autograph, his fingerprint. Newspaper reports suggest the attention was unwanted by Tjungurrayi, who was working at Central Mount Wedge Station at the time. He even shaved off his beard at one stage to be less recognisable. In 1950 the image was used on an 8¬Ω pence stamp and a 2 shillings and 6 pence (half crown) stamp. Tjungurrayi was the first Aboriginal person to appear on an Australian postage stamp. The stamp was re-released in 1952 and eventually sold over 99 million pounds. Tjungurrayi appeared on the cover of Walkabout again in September 1950. The design of the Australian two- dollar coin was inspired by a drawing of Tjungurrayi by artist Ainslie Roberts in 1988. Personal life Tjungurrayi and his wife Long Rose Nagnala had three sons, Tim Leura Tjapaltjarri, Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri, both notable artists, and Immanuel Rutjinama Tjapaltjarri who became a Lutheran pastor. Tim Leura Tjapaltjarri's work Ancestor Dreaming was the subject of another Australian stamp in 1988. Tjungurrayi continued to live in the Tanami region, dying there on 28 March 1965. He is thought to have been over 70 at the time of his death. His obituary appeared in the Northern Territory News and on the front page of the Centralian Advocate, a rare honour for an Aboriginal person at that time.
