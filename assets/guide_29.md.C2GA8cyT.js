The closest metro stations are: * I√©na near the southern end of the Place d'I√©na. * Charles de Gaulle - √âtoile at the northern end of the Place Charles de Gaulle - √âtoile. History On the March 2, 1864, the Avenue d'I√©na replaced the former rue des Batailles, which ran between the avenue Albert De Mun and the Place d'I√©na. The rue des Batailles had been a street in the village of Chaillot, engulfed by the expanding Paris in 1786. For some years afterwards, two town boundaries of Chaillot could be seen at the wall of sieur L√©lu and the house of sieur Jamard. The street housed several hospitals and a private lunatic asylum was set up in the house once occupied by the Chevalier Pierre Bayard du Terrail. The chemist Charles Derosne (1779‚Äì1846), worked in 7 rue des Batailles at the extraction of sugar from sugarbeet. On December 20, 1961, the name Place de l'Uruguay was given to the intersection of the streets Rue Galil√©e and Jean Giraudoux with the avenue. Composition * n¬∞ 1 : Palais d'I√©na, a classified monument partly constructed by Auguste Perret including a rotunda. * n¬∞ 2 (corner of the avenue d'I√©na and the avenue Albert-de-Mun): Site where the mansion of politician Daniel Wilson was erected. It then became then the private residence of the ambassador of the United States. This was subsequently demolished, giving place to a modern building, leaving only the enclosing wall surmounted by grilles. This building is currently the Cultural Centre of the Korean Embassy (in French and Korean). * n¬∞ 4: H√¥tel Sanchez de Larragoiti was built in 1897-1898 by architect Xavier Schoellkopf for Joaquim Sanchez de Larragoiti. The original architect was √âdward Georg√© who died in 1897. The house was probably the first masterpiece of Art Nouveau architecture in Paris. It was sold in 1907 and transformed by architect Gustave Rives who removed almost all the Art Nouveau decorations and replaced them with Louis XV style, replacing Schoellkopf's signature with his own. The house was featured with illustrations in La Construction Moderne, 12, 20 and 27 January 1900, available to view at the library of the Cit√© de l'Architecture in Paris. * n¬∞ 6: H√¥tel de Cambac√©r√®s: I retain a very exact memory , wrote Andr√© Becq de Fouqui√®res, of the balls held in this beautiful residence during the spring of 1913 and I still see the Count of Jarnac, the host's uncle, receiving the masked ladies, in their periwinkle-coloured dominos, handing their personal invitation cards to him and dissimulating anonymity under velvet and silk. On the terrace, the countess Stanislas de Montebello helped her brother do the honors for the evening. There was all the nobility of France, many diplomats; and I remember that this night I saw for the last time before the war, in which they were to play such a part, the princes Sixte and Xavier of Bourbon- Parma. (Mon Paris et ses Parisiens, 1953, p. 144). This building is currently the Iranian Embassy. * n¬∞ 8: Ex mansion of the Philippe family. It also was the Paris residence of the baron Philippe de Rothschild who used to rent the first floor. It is now part of The Shangri-La Hotel. * n¬∞ 10: Mansion of Prince Roland Bonaparte. Sir Charles Mendl and Lady Mendl occupied an apartment there. The painter Jean-Gabriel Domergue had his studio here. This is probably the site No. 12, rue des Batailles in which Balzac had a flat in 1834. Today this building is the head office of Ubifrance, the French agency for the international development of companies. In 2009 it reopened as a luxury five-star hotel: The Shangri-La Hotel Paris. * n¬∞ 11: A building on the site of the mansion of Charles Ephrussi. * n¬∞ 17: Houses the German Goethe Institute (in French and German). * n¬∞ 19: A private mansion built in 1913, in the neo-classic style, by Ren√© Sergent for Alfred Heidelbach which currently houses the galleries of the Japanese and Chinese Panth√©on Bouddhique of the Guimet Museum. * n¬∞ 30: Houses the Union √âquestre d'√éle de France, the equestrian union.

The chain began its expansion in 1978, opening other branches in Montreal (on Laurier Avenue, Saint Denis Street, Park Avenue, and Peel Street). At the same time, it began computerizing its inventory, becoming one of the first bookstores to do so. In 1995, Renaud-Bray opened a large store on Yonge Street in Toronto, Ontario. This store was a major failure and, in 1996, Renaud-Bray entered bankruptcy protection. The chain, however, survived. In the summer of 1999, Renaud-Bray purchased two of its competitors in Quebec: Librairie Garneau and Librairie Champigny, giving it 23 outlets across the province. As of September 27, 2016, the company's website lists 29 locations including 12 in Montreal, 3 in Quebec City and 2 in Laval. In May 2015, Quebecor signed an agreement to sell the 14 retail stores of Archambault and the single unit Paragraph Anglophone bookstore to Renaud-Bray.

In the prewar period, he was known for his publications on Japanese history, philosophy of religion, Indian philosophy, and colonialism. He is frequently called a \\"right-wing\\" writer, although he described himself as anti-capitalist and rejected the label \\"right-wing\\".  Background  ≈åkawa was born in Sakata, Yamagata, Japan in 1886. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University in 1911, where he had studied Vedic literature and classical Indian philosophy. After graduation, ≈åkawa worked for the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff doing translation work. He had a sound knowledge of German, French, English, Sanskrit and Pali.Wakabayashi, Modern Japanese Thought, p. 226 He briefly flirted with socialism in his college years, but in the summer of 1913 he read a copy of Sir Henry Cotton's New India, or India in transition (1886, revised 1905) which dealt with the contemporary political situation. After reading this book, ≈åkawa abandoned \\"complete cosmopolitanism\\" (sekaijin) for Pan-Asianism. Later that year articles by Anagarika Dharmapala and Maulavi Barkatullah appeared in the magazine Michi, published by D≈çkai, a religious organization in which ≈åkawa was later to play a prominent part. While he studied, he briefly housed the Indian independence leader Rash Behari Bose. After years of study of foreign philosophies, he became increasingly convinced that the solution to Japan's pressing social and political problems lay in an alliance with Asian independence movements, a revival of pre-modern Japanese philosophy, and a renewed emphasis on the kokutai principles.Samuels, Securing Japan: Tokyo's Grand Strategy and the Future of East Asia, p. 18 ≈åkawa as a youth In 1918, ≈åkawa went to work for the South Manchurian Railway Company, under its East Asian Research Bureau. Together with Ikki Kita he founded the nationalist discussion group and political club Y≈´zonsha. In the 1920s, he became an instructor of history and colonial policy at Takushoku University, where he was also active in the creation of anti-capitalist and nationalist student groups.Calvocoressi, The Penguin History of the Second World War p. 657 Meanwhile, he introduced Rudolf Steiner's theory of social threefolding to Japan. He developed a friendship with Aikido founder Morihei Ueshiba during this time period. In 1926, ≈åkawa published his most influential work: , which was so popular that it was reprinted 46 times by the end of World War II. ≈åkawa also became involved in a number of attempted coups d'√©tat by the Japanese military in the early 1930s, including the March Incident, for which he was sentenced to five years in prison in 1935.Jansen, The Making of Modern Japan, p. 572 Released after only two years, he briefly re-joined the South Manchurian Railway Company before accepting a post as a professor at Hosei University in 1939. He continued to publish numerous books and articles, helping popularize the idea that a \\"clash of civilizations\\" between the East and West was inevitable, and that Japan was destined to assume the mantle of liberator and protector of Asia against the United States and other Western nations.Wakabayashi, Modern Japanese Thought, pp. 226-227  Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal  ≈åkawa in court. He had just patted Tojo on the head (seated in front) and is being restrained by a guard. After World War II, the Allies prosecuted ≈åkawa as a class-A war criminal. Of the twenty-eight people indicted with this charge, he was the only one who wasn't a military officer or government official. The Allies described him to the press as the \\"Japanese Goebbels\\" and claimed that he had long agitated for a war between Japan and the West. In pre-trial hearings, Okawa countered that he had merely translated and commented on Vladimir Solovyov's geopolitical philosophy in 1924, and that in fact Pan-Asianism did not advocate for war.Japan‚Äôs Pan-Asianism and the Legitimacy of Imperial World Order, 1931‚Äì1945 During the trial, ≈åkawa behaved erratically ‚Äì dressing in pajamas, sitting barefoot, and hitting the bald head of the former prime minister Hideki T≈çj≈ç while shouting \\"Inder! Kommen Sie!\\" (Come, Indian!) in German, and so on. Some heard him shout \\"This is act one of the comedy!\\" U.S. Army psychiatrist Daniel Jaffe examined him and reported he was unfit to stand trial. Therefore, the presiding judge Sir William Webb (The President of the Tokyo Tribunal) concluded that he was mentally ill and dropped the case against him. (Of the remaining defendants, seven were hanged and the rest imprisoned.)Maga, Judgment at Tokyo: The Japanese War Crimes Trials (review of book by Eric Jaffe) From the beginning of the tribunal, ≈åkawa was saying that the court was a farce and not even worthy of being called a legal court. Therefore, some people still believe that he was feigning madness.  After the war  ≈åkawa was transferred from the jail to a US Army hospital in Japan, which concluded that he had mental instability, caused by syphilis. Later, he was transferred to the Tokyo Metropolitan Matsuzawa Hospital, a famous mental hospital, where he completed the third Japanese translation of the entire Quran.While ≈åkawa made reference to the Arabic original, he made his translation from about ten language editions, including English, Chinese, German, and French, as his knowledge of Arabic was only basic. At least three more translations of the Quran into Japanese have been produced since then, including several from the Arabic original. ≈åkawa's version is difficult to find nowadays. See Kr√§mer, ‚ÄúPan-Asianism‚Äôs Religious Undercurrents,‚Äù pp. 627‚Äì630. He was released from hospital in 1948. He spent the final years of his life writing a memoir, Anraku no Mon, reflecting on how he found peace in the mental hospital. In October 1957, Prime Minister of India Jawaharlal Nehru requested an audience with him during a brief visit to Japan. The invitation was hand-delivered to ≈åkawa's house by an Indian Embassy official, who found that ≈åkawa was already on his deathbed and was unable to leave the house. He died two months later.Sekioka Hideyuki. ≈åkawa Sh≈´mei no Dai-Ajia-Shugi. Tokyo: Kodansha, 2007. p. 203.

The teleplay was also written by Marvin Werlin, Mark Werlin and Duane Poole, is a romantic thriller that starred Yasmine Bleeth, James Wilder and Robin Givens. Plot Due to a tragic childhood accident, Emily Gilmore (Yasmine Bleeth) is left scarred both physically and mentally. The large scar on her face is a constant reminder to Emily that her career and love life are suffering. Lonely yet talented, Emily longs for a successful career and romance but is trapped by insecurity and fear. The handsome Alec Dalton (James Wilder) turns Emily's life around and makes her feel truly happy and secure for the first time in her life. Unfortunately, Alec talks Emily into stealing money from her employer. But the old man that Emily works for comes in during the heist and has a heart attack. Emily stays behind to help him while Alec runs off. He gets away with the money but Emily is sent to prison. She is so in love with Alec she does not say a word about Alec's involvement. While Emily is in prison she learns that Alec has run away with her own sister, Sheila Gilmore (Chandra West). Devastated, Emily gets in a fight with another inmate and because of the injuries she sustains she has to be seen by Dr. Matthew Sheridan (Richard Beymer). The doctor tells her that he can correct her scars for free with an experimental surgery. It's a great success and Emily is beautiful, almost unrecognizable. After the surgery Emily begins a relationship with the surgeon, who showers her in gifts and love. She is released from prison and the two get engaged, but Emily leaves him when she discovers that Matthew had reconstructed her face to be identical to his dead wife's. Emily attempts to begin again, changing her name and starting her own business as a fashion designer with her friend from prison Claudia (Robin Givens). She reconnects with a kind man from her past, Paul (Ricky Paull Goldin), and starts a relationship with him (though he does not know her true identity.)

The series aired on state-owned broadcaster Magyar Telev√≠zi√≥ (Hungarian Television) bi-weekly in primetime, on Thursday evenings, during it entire run. The series was a soap opera, dealing with the lives of ordinary people, living and working in or around an average lak√≥telep (Gazdagr√©ti microdistrict, a socialist housing estate with several thousand flats in Budapest, built in the 1980s). Its characters were explored, over time, in equal depth: ranging from elderly pensioners, busy middle aged professionals, up-and-coming young people, and children growing into their teens. Many consider Szomsz√©dok to be the definitive Hungarian television series, being a period piece of sorts that covers the last few years of the communist era, the rendszerv√°ltoz√°s (democratic transition), and nearly a decade of the new market economy Hungary thereafter. The series often dealt with the important topics and issues of the day, which affected the lives of everyday people in Hungary. These included politics, the ongoing economical liberalization, and topics such as drug addiction, organized crime, and the introduction of personal computers at home. Szomsz√©dok featured the first gay character in Hungarian broadcast media, a male hairdresser portrayed as a flamboyant, over- the-top gay man, appearing in a smaller, comical recurring role from 1990 to 1993.  Current airing  After some time off the air, Szomsz√©dok was rerun on M1 (Hungary's terrestrial broadcast public television channel) until 13 March 2015. The rerun was initially narrated by computer text inserts, mainly to guide those too young to remember the late communist era (e.g. how much bread cost that time or what significance a particular public figure in mention had at the time). The original cast and director of the series publicly protested against this practice and the information text bubbles were discontinued after a few episodes. Reruns of this programme is now shown on its sister channel, the classic channel M3.

The sanctuary, designated in January 1981, is located off Sapelo Island, Georgia, and is one of 14 marine sanctuaries and monuments that make up the U.S. National Marine Sanctuary System. Within the 22-square-mile (57 km2) sanctuary, there are both rocky ledges and sandy flat places. The reef's rocky sandstone outcrops, submerged beneath 60 to 70 feet (18 to 21 m) of water, can be as tall as 2 to 3 m and are highly complex. These nooks and crannies provide plenty of places for invertebrates to latch on to and for fish to hide in. Together these animals form a dense tapestry of living creatures that in places completely hides the rock. That gives the habitat of Gray's Reef its common name ‚Äî a \\"live bottom\\". Researchers from NOAA and the University of Georgia have used the site to study invertebrate and vertebrate paleontology as well as the effects of erosion. Human occupation Although Gray's Reef is more than beyond today's shoreline, and 60 to 70 feet (18 to 21 m) below the Atlantic Ocean, it was once dry land and part of the mainland as recently as 8,000 years ago. Human occupation of this area dates back at least 13,250 years, and coincides with one of the most dramatic periods of climate change in recent earth history, toward the end of the Ice Age, in the Late Pleistocene epoch. Sea levels were more than 200 feet lower than present levels, and the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico shorelines were 100 or more miles seaward of their present locations. A 2003 research project undertaken by University of Georgia researchers Ervan G, Garrison, Sherri L. Littman, and Megan Mitchell, looked at and reported on the Gray‚Äôs Reef fossils and artifacts, including artifacts from a period of occupation by Clovis culture and Paleoindian hunters dating back more than 10,000 years.

It is located from the center of Paris. History People have lived on the site of Chennevi√®res-sur-Marne since pre-historic times, the hilly, riverside location being an advantageous spot. The Gauls built villages on the site and began planting vineyards there in the fourth century. The city's name is derived from \\"Canaveria\\" which stand for the French word for 'hemp', a locally grown product providing material for the fabrication of boat cordage.(French) Le Patrimoine des Communes du Val-de-Marne, Editions Flohic, Charenton-le-Pont, 1994 The town prospered until the Hundred Years' War. Locals harnessed the power of the Marne river to turn a flour mill.(French) Le Val-de-Marne autrefois, by Jean Roblin, Editions Horvath, Lyon, 1994 The river also served the citizens for transport: a ferry linked Chennevi√®res with the nearby town of La Varenne. A bateau-lavoir - a floating laundry service - was anchored in the river until 1865. During the Belle √âpoque, this village, like many of the rural towns surrounding Paris, became an attractive get-away for urban-weary Parisians. One of its restaurants, l'Ecu de France, became a gathering point for artists in particular. On 7 July 1899, a part of the territory of Chennevi√®res-sur-Marne was detached and merged with a part of the territory of La Queue-en-Brie and a part of the territory of Villiers-sur- Marne to create the commune of Le Plessis-Tr√©vise. Transport Chennevi√®res- sur-Marne is served by no station of the Paris M√©tro, RER, or suburban rail network. The closest station to Chennevi√®res-sur-Marne is La Varenne - Chennevi√®res station on Paris RER line A. This station is located in the neighboring commune of Saint-Maur-des-Foss√©s, from the town center of Chennevi√®res-sur-Marne.

He criticizes the cultural left, which is exemplified by post- structuralists such as Michel Foucault and post-modernists such as Jean- Fran√ßois Lyotard. Although these intellectuals make insightful claims about the ills of society, Rorty holds that they provide no alternatives and even present progress as problematic at times. On the other hand, the progressive left, exemplified for Rorty by John Dewey, makes progress its priority in its goal of \\"achieving our country.\\" Rorty sees the reformist left as acting in the philosophical spirit of pragmatism. Summary Achieving Our Country is an adaptation of lectures Rorty gave at Harvard University. It consists of expanded versions of the three lectures, two appendices (\\"Movements and Campaigns\\", \\"The Inspirational Value of Great Works of Literature\\") as well as the notes, acknowledgements, and index. =\\"American National Pride: Whitman and Dewey\\"= Rorty begins by arguing the case for \\"national pride\\"; having pride in a nation motivates people to seek to improve their nation ‚Äì one must feel emotion of some sort\\"... insufficient national pride makes energetic and effective debate about national policy unlikely. Emotional involvement with one's country - feelings of intense shame or of glowing pride aroused by various parts of its history and by various present-day national policies - is necessary if political deliberation is to be imaginative and productive.\\" pg 3 of Achieving Our Country. But in recent times, such as after the Vietnam War and towards the end of the twentieth century, art and for Rorty literature in particular are not cultivating a form of national pride and hence are affecting politics: \\"Competition for political leadership is in part a competition between differing stories about a nation's self-identity, and between differing symbols of its greatness.pg 4 Rorty singles out Snow Crash and Leslie Marmon Silko's Almanac of the Dead as modern works that serve as exemplars of the second of two predominant narratives, a rejection of national pride with \\"tones either of self-mockery or of self-disgust\\" (the other narrative is a \\"simple-minded militaristic chauvinism\\"). The rejection of national pride is fundamentally weakening and dispiriting: \\"Novels like Stephenson's, Condon's The Manchurian Candidate, and Pynchon's Vineland are novels not of social protest but rather of rueful acquiescence in the end of American hopes.\\"pg 6 The second narrative is equally dispiriting but for a different reason; leftist literature often focuses on what is wrong with America and where there is hypocrisy and actions at odds with avowed ideals, so \\"When young intellectuals watch John Wayne war movies after reading Heidegger, Foucault, Stephenson, or Silko, they often become convinced that they live in a violent, inhuman, corrupt country ... this insight does not move them to formulate a legislative program, to join a political movement, or to share in a national hope.\\"pg 7 Rorty contrasts the named novels with the socialist novels of the early 1900s ‚Äì The Jungle, An American Tragedy, The Grapes of Wrath, etc. The essential theme to those novels is that America is not yet achieved, that \\"the tone of the Gettysburg Address was absolutely right, but that our country would have to transform itself in order to fulfill Lincoln's hopes.\\"pg 8 Rorty quotes approvingly Walt Whitman's Democratic Vistas:Walt Whitman: Democratic Vistas \\"'democracy' is a great word, whose history ... remains unwritten, because that history has yet to be enacted.\\" This theme is consistent to the left and is where Rorty derives the title: \\"The Left, by definition, is the party of hope.

The thesis of the book is that counter-cultural movements have failed to effect any progressive political or economic consequences; thus counter- culture is not a threat to \\"the system\\". Consumerism Potter and Heath argue against the notion that consumerism is driven by conformity; instead, they state we are largely motivated by competitive consumption, which is an attempt to attain status distinction through the products we buy. They suggest it is the nonconformists, not the conformists, who are driving consumer spending. They claim this has led to the \\"rebel consumer\\". Since all goods depend on exclusivity for their value, a purchasing arms race is always in existence as consumers struggle to outdo one another: if you lag, you become mainstream. They note, the image of rebelliousness and critique of mass society has been one of the most powerful forces driving consumerism for the past forty years. Far from being 'subversive,' being a rebel consumer has had no political or economic consequences and is simply a form of status distinction. Conformity Following their claim that conformity isn't something perpetuated by mainstream media, Potter and Heath identify other sources of conformity using work from Thomas Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Sigmund Freud. They describe conformity as the byproduct of simple market preferences, or alternatively, an attempt to resolve a collective action problem. For instance, they claim school uniforms successfully curb the fashion 'arms race' created between students when no restrictions are in place, and they are not utilized to remove individualism, as many counter- cultural figures have suggested. According to Potter and Heath, social customs provide security that saves us from a constant need to recalculate the significance of our surroundings. For example, thanks to rules of traffic, a pedestrian can generally safely stand on a sidewalk, without needing to calculate at each instance whether an oncoming bus might stay within its lane or whether it might hit the pedestrian. Thus, rules are by no means inherently oppressive: the undesirability of many facets of society (such as consumerism) are, if anything, caused from the 'bottom up'. To Potter and Heath, some rules may be beneficial, and some rules may be useful. Collective action problems Heath and Potter state most of society's problems (and rules) are traceable to collective action problems, not to traits inherent in consumer culture. They assert culture jammers, attempts to disrupt the existing social order, are largely inconsequential. They further suggest, this 'subversive' action allows people to wrongly claim a political element to their lifestyle preferences, and in extreme cases, this can result in the glorification of criminality as a form of dissent. The authors offer a number of solutions to these collective action problems. They recommend a simple legislative solution to problems such as consumerism, for example, through eliminating tax deductions for advertising. (The notion that top-down solutions are far more effective than the \\"think globally act locally\\" grassroots movement of the 1960s is a running theme). The authors also point, however, to the counterculture's tendency to reject institutional solutions, a mistake which merely allows the problem to remain intact. Criticism In his review of the book, Derrick O'Keefe claims the book does not argue for \\"a more coherent and effective Left politics,\\" but for a \\"strident defense of markets and capitalism.\\" He accuses the authors of using strawman arguments, and misrepresenting people they criticize (he accuses them of oversimplifying Naomi Klein's No Logo and misrepresenting Antonio Gramsci's concept of cultural hegemony). O'Keefe also accuses the book of being racist, as it claims that Detroit's black population's participation in the 12th Street riot was the cause of the neighborhood's problems while omitting the many root causes of the riots entirely. He also cites the book \\"lumping political prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal in with the likes of Lorena Bobbitt and the Columbine shooters.\\" O'Keefe claims that the authors' defense of white rapper Eminem (while criticizing contemporary black hip-hop) shows their ignorance of the subject and ignores politically conscious black hip-hop artists. A review of the book in The Guardian claims \\"the argument it makes is important and original\\" but says that \\"in places it is also unfair, light on evidence and repetitively polemical.\\" It also claims the book \\"relies too heavily on setting up straw men,\\" and finds that while the authors are pro-welfare and anti-unfettered business, their \\"dislike of the capitalist fixation with youth culture... comes close to a fogeyish distaste for youth culture itself\\" and they \\"sound as nostalgic as any conservative newspaper columnist for the world before the 60s.\\" Additionally, the review claims the authors focus too much on North America, ignoring the \\"more paternalistic and less fashion-fixated\\" capitalism and non-commodified dissent in other parts of the world. A review of the book from The A.V. Club claims the \\"prose... betrays a deep social conservatism,\\" and the authors \\"frustratingly treat the concepts of gradual reform and a total revolution in human consciousness as an either/or proposition.\\" It further claims the good ideas of the book were \\"borrowed wholesale from [Thomas] Frank and from Bobos in Paradise author David Brooks,\\" but the book fails to have equal quality due to \\"the unsavory combo of faulty reasoning and weak arguments.\\" =Authors Response= Heath and Potter responded to the criticisms made in interviews, lectures, and an epilogue added to later editions of the book.http://podcasts.tvo.org/bi/audio/BIHeathPotter052007.mp3 They gave their personal and political biographies to establish their left-wing credentials. They also acknowledged flaws in the explanation of some of their arguments. However, they also criticized their reviewers for confusing their attack on the ideals of counterculture as an attack on art or the Left in general.

Purpose  The mitotic index is a measure of cellular proliferation. It is defined as the percentage of cells undergoing mitosis in a given population of cells. Mitosis is the division of somatic cells into two daughter cells. Durations of the cell cycle and mitosis vary in different cell types. An elevated mitotic index indicates more cells are dividing. In cancer cells, the mitotic index may be elevated compared to normal growth of tissues or cellular repair of the site of an injury. The mitotic index is therefore an important prognostic factor predicting both overall survival and response to chemotherapy in most types of cancer. It may lose much of its predictive value for elderly populations. For example, a low mitotic index loses any prognostic value for women over 70 years old with breast cancer.  Calculation  The mitotic index is the number of cells undergoing mitosis divided by the total number of cells.Edexcel practical materials created by Salters-Nuffield Advanced Biology, copyright University of York Science Education Group A typical figure of mitotic index includes statements like \\"10 mitotic figures are noted per 10 high power fields\\" followed by \\"4 mitotic figures noted per 50 high power fields.\\" Formula \\\\mbox{Mitotic I}=\\\\frac\\\\mbox{(P+M+A+T)}\\\\mbox{N}\\\\cdot 100\\\\% where (P+M+A+T) is the sum of all cells in phase as prophase, metaphase, anaphase and telophase, respectively and N is total number of cells.

Villeroi's first submarine (1832) De Villeroi's first submarine In 1832, de Villeroi completed a small submarine, possibly named \\"Nautilus\\" in reference to the 1800 submarine created by Robert Fulton. The submarine was 10 feet, 6 inches long by 27 inches high by 25 inches wide and displaced about six tons when submerged. She was equipped with eight dead-lights on top to provide interior light, and a top hatch with a retractable conning tower for surface navigation. For propulsion, she had three sets of duck-foot paddles and a large rudder. She was also equipped with hatches with leather seals in order to make possible some manipulations outside the hull, a small ballast system with a lever and piston, and a 50 lb anchor. The ship had a complement of three men. This submarine was demonstrated at Fromentine, Noirmoutier, near Nantes, France, on 12 August 1832, and later to representatives of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in 1837. De Villeroi tried several times to sell his submarine designs to the French Navy (1832, 1855 and 1863), but he was apparently turned down every time. In 1842, de Villeroi was reputedly a professor for drawing and mathematics at the Saint-Donatien Junior Seminary in Nantes, where Jules Verne was also a student, leading to speculation he may have inspired Verne's conceptual design for the Nautilus in Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea; however, no evidence for Villeroi's employment at Saint-Donatien has yet been found, and no direct link between the two men has ever been established. United States career In 1856, de Villeroi emigrated to the United States. During the late 1850s, Brutus de Villeroi went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in the United States, where he developed several submarines. He is recorded in an 1860 American census, where his occupation is described as \\"natural genius\\". =Salvage submarine (1859)= Brutus de Villeroi's salvage submarine, seized on the Delaware River in 1861 His first American submarine was built for salvage purposes, and it gained fame when it was seized on May 16, 1861, by the suspicious Philadelphia police as it sailed up the Delaware River. Commander Henry K. Hoff, USN, wrote a report to Captain S.F. Dupont, Commanding Officer of Naval Station Philadelphia, describing the performance of the submarine and its interest to the Navy: De Villeroi's next ship, the USS Alligator, would be largely inspired from this design. =The Alligator (1862)= Plan of his submarine, by Brutus de Villeroi, describing the oar arrangement. Alligator in 1863. De Villeroi proposed a submarine design to the United States Navy, to counter the threat of Confederate States Navy ironclad warships. The Navy signed a contract with him in autumn 1861, for the submarine to be built in 40 days, for a sum of $14,000. The ship became the US Navy's first submarine, the Alligator. It was never officially commissioned and therefore does not have the \\"USS\\" prefix. De Villeroi supervised the first phases of the construction in Philadelphia, but was progressively evicted from the project as he opposed some modifications to his design. It was the first submarine to be ordered and built for the US Navy, the first to have a diver's lockout chamber, the first to have on-board air compressors for air renewal and diver support, the first to have an air-purifying system, and the first to have electrically detonated limpet mines. It was designed primarily to launch divers, who could then plant bombs under surface ships or perform operations underwater. Later life In 1863, de Villeroi, after a dispute with his American associates, proposed his submarine design to the government of Napoleon III of France, but it was rejected as impractical and poorly researched. The French Navy was also already working on another design, Plongeur, with a compressed air engine, which was launched in 1863. De Villeroi remained in the United States and died of chronic bronchitis in 1874. He was buried alongside his wife, Eulalie de Villeroi, in Rosedale Memorial Park, in Bensalem, Pennsylvania.

The collaborative efforts of a significant portion of the Montreal arts community was ordered destroyed by the mayor and was done so by municipal workers with police escort. The 16 main installations and dozens of smaller installations were taken to a municipal impound lot, in some cases left outside to be destroyed by the elements. The actions of the mayor were condemned by the provincial cultural affairs minister, principally because the mayor lacked legal authority over the Olympics as a whole. Corridart was intended to showcase Canadian and Montreal arts to an international audience. =\\"Will and Representation\\"= Ryan McCourt, pictured with his sculpture \\"Destroyer of Obstacles,\\" in front of the Shaw Conference Centre in Edmonton, August 2007, a month before the work was ordered removed by Mayor Stephen Mandel.

Simons concludes, \\"In his haste to appease a few protesters, the mayor, usually a champion of the arts, made a serious error in judgment. Instead of giving McCourt's divinely inspired statues the bum's rush, we should be celebrating this Canadian cross- pollination of cultures and aesthetic forms\\". The Globe and Mails columnist Margaret Wente agreed with Simons: \\"The mayor, of course, was quite wrong. Mr. McCourt's sculptures did not insult the Hindu community. They insulted a small but vocal conservative religious group that is about as representative of Hindus as Hassidic Jews are of Jews....

The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), while also having the power to regulate broadcast content, intervenes only in the most serious and controversial cases. Many Canadian broadcast stations broadcast explicit programming under certain circumstances, albeit with viewer discretion advisories and at adult- oriented times on the schedule. CTV, for example, has aired controversial series such as The Sopranos, Nip/Tuck and The Osbournes in prime time without editing, and some Canadian television broadcasters, such as Citytv, in the 1970s, aired softcore pornography after 12 midnight EST, which can therefore be viewed as early as 9:00 p.m. in other parts of Canada (i.e., anywhere in the Pacific Time Zone). The Code of Ethics of the Canadian Association of Broadcasters defines the \\"late viewing period\\" as the hours from 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. Outside this period, the Code of Ethics prohibits programming containing sexually explicit material or coarse or offensive language. This association also publishes a \\"Voluntary Code Regarding Violence in Television Programming\\". In enforcing these two Codes, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council permits nudity to be broadcast during the day as long as it is considered non-sexual. For example, the CBSC permitted a 4:00 p.m. broadcast of the movie Wildcats containing male frontal nudity in a locker-room scene and female nudity in a bathtub. The CBSC has also permitted the film Striptease, which contains scenes of bare female breasts, to be shown at 8:00 p.m. The CBSC summarizes its policy on sexual activity as follows: Film In the early 1910s, motion pictures were rising in popularity. It was decided nationally that censorship of them was necessary in order to be suitable for a wide, general audience of varying ages, mental, and educational levels. However, since national censorship for such a large and diverse country was unworkable, each province would censor according to their own provincial community standards. However, Ontario would be the \\"main\\" censor in that theatrical prints would be censored/edited by the Ontario censors then distributed throughout Ontario and the other provinces. The other provinces would provide additional censorship/editing if it was necessary for their own province. The Ontario board was formed in 1911; other provinces followed shortly thereafter. Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland never formed any boards but instead took their advice from the New Brunswick and Nova Scotia boards. The censors had no strict rules however; they often took advice from the British Board of Film Censors in the early years. In the 1920s, the Ontario censor board objected to content such as:Take 30, October 11, 1968, CBC Television (digitized episode) * actors pointing guns directly at the camera, or at other actors due to the possible negative effects on children and mentally weaker individuals * machine guns * scenes with women smoking * profanity, vulgarity, and obscenity * disrespect for officers of the law * depiction and patriotic waving of the American flag, this was so the boards could promote a sense of Canadian nationalism * illicit sexual relations * nudity * cruelty to animals * drinking * drug use In the 1920s, the Canadian film boards removed American patriotism from imported films, citing their damage to a pro-British sentiment. Eventually, six of the provincial censor boards adopted classification in 1953 though films were still censored for certain categories. The idea of classification was first proposed by Ottawa child welfare advocate, and future mayor, Charlotte Whitton in 1920; however, at the time it was criticized with one newspaper editor claiming \\"A film that's not suitable for a ten-year-old should not be seen at all.\\" It was in the 1950s that the censorship standards became more permissive. For example, A Farewell to Arms contained an intense birth scene, a character yells \\"Damn!\\" in Witness for the Prosecution, and Peyton Place contained \\"pungent language\\". All of which was passed, in Ontario at least. In the 1960s, Manitoba became the first province to fully adopt classification and abandon censorship. Most Canadian provinces still have ratings boards that have the power to order cuts to movies and may even ban the showing of films if they violate Canada's Criminal Code sanctions against depicting sexualized violence and sex acts involving people under the age of 18. Movies formerly banned in some Canadian provinces include Deep Throat and Pretty Baby. One particularly famous censorship controversy involved the award-winning German film The Tin Drum, which was banned as pornographic by Ontario's film review board in 1980. The romantic comedy Young People Fucking prompted the Government of Canada to introduce Bill C-10, to allow revoking government funds from films the government deemed offensive. Strong public backlash led to the bill dying on the order paper.YPF (2007) Trivia, Internet Movie Database, retrieved February 26, 2013 Print In 1937, under Maurice Duplessis, Quebec's Union Nationale government passed the Act to protect the Province Against Communistic Propaganda (commonly known as the \\"Padlock Law\\"), which banned the printing, publishing or distributing of \\"any newspaper, periodical, pamphlet, circular, document or writing, propagating Communism or Bolshevism\\". The law was struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada as an attempt to legislate criminal law ultra vires of the provincial legislature in the 1957 Switzman v Elbling decision. In 1949, spearheaded by the campaigning of MP Davie Fulton, crime comics were banned in Canada in Bill 10 of the 21st Canadian Parliament's 1st session (informally known as the Fulton Bill). In 1955, the importation of American The Atom Spy Hoax was deemed seditious as it questioned the Canadian government's handling of the Igor Gouzenko affair. =Little Sisters Book and Art Emporium v Canada= One of the most famous ongoing censorship controversies in Canada has been the dispute between Canada Customs and LGBT retail bookstores such as Little Sister's in Vancouver and Glad Day in Toronto. Through the 1980s and into the 1990s, Canada Customs frequently stopped material being shipped to the two stores on the grounds of \\"obscenity\\". Both stores frequently had to resort to the legal system to challenge the confiscation of their property. In 2000, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Canada Customs did not have the authority to make its own judgments about the permissibility of material being shipped to the stores but was permitted to confiscate only material that had specifically been ruled by the courts to constitute an offence under the Criminal Code. In addition a report from 2013, reports that over 100 books, magazine, and other written works were challenged for removal in schools and libraries. Some of these challenges were upheld; however, some were rejected. Internet Internet content is not specifically regulated in Canada, however local laws apply to websites hosted in Canada as well as to residents who host sites on servers in other jurisdictions. A well-known example is the case of Ernst Z√ºndel, who was investigated by the Canadian Human Rights Commission for promoting ethnic hatred via his website. In July 2005, in the middle of a labour dispute with the group, Telus briefly blocked a website being run by members of the Telecommunications Workers Union. It cited concerns over the publication of photos of employees who had crossed picket lines, and its advocating for readers to jam the company's phone lines. The site was unblocked after an injunction was obtained to prohibit it from publishing the personal information of Telus employees. In November 2006, Canadian Internet service providers Bell, Bell Aliant, MTS Allstream, Rogers, Shaw, SaskTel, Telus, and Vid√©otron announced Project Cleanfeed Canada, a voluntary effort to block websites hosting child pornography. The list of blocked sites is compiled from reports by Internet users and investigated by the independent organization Cybertip.ca. Project Cleanfeed was praised following its founding by Royal Canadian Mounted Police Supt. Earla-Kim McColl (then-head of the National Child Exploitation Coordination Centre). In October 2011, the Supreme Court of Canada unanimously ruled that online publications cannot be found liable for linking to defamatory material as long as the linking itself is not defamatory.\\"Internet links not libel, top court rules\\", Meagan Fitzpatrick, CBC News, October 19, 2011 = Online gambling = In 2015, the province of Quebec proposed legislation which would require unlicensed online gambling websites, as defined by Loto-Qu√©bec, to be blocked by ISPs in defense of the Loto-Qu√©bec-operated Espacejeux. The proposal was criticized for the possible precedents that such legislation could set, as it would be the first internet censorship law passed by a Canadian government, as well as the law's intent to maintain a monopoly. Bill 74 was passed by the provincial government in May 2016. It was challenged in the Quebec Superior Court by the Canadian Wireless Telecommunications Association, and by the Public Interest Advocacy Centre in a complaint to the CRTC. In December 2016, the Commission decided that it would await the outcome of the court case before making a final ruling, but iterated its opinion that under the Telecommunications Act, no ISP may censor websites without its consent, and that \\"compliance with other legal or juridical requirements ‚Äì whether municipal, provincial, or foreign ‚Äì does not in and of itself justify the blocking of specific websites by Canadian carriers, in the absence of commission approval\\". In July 2018, the law was struck down by the Quebec Superior Court, citing these matters as being responsibility of the federal government, and the notion of net neutrality upheld by the CRTC. = Copyright infringement = On January 28, 2018, FairPlay Canada, an industry coalition formed by major Canadian telecom and media conglomerates, proposed to the CRTC the formation of a mandatory system to block websites \\"blatantly\\" involved in copyright infringement. The system would utilize an independent organization to submit blocklists to the CRTC for approval; there would be no judicial oversight, and the Federal Court of Appeal could only intervene after the fact. The group argued that illegal streaming of copyrighted media was harming the businesses of themselves and content producers, and that streaming boxes had eased such access. The proposal has been widely criticized for the possibility of abuse; Michael Geist described the proposal as being \\"ill-advised and dangerous\\", citing criticisms surrounding other site-blocking systems, the lack of judicial oversight, concerns that accidental overblocking could violate the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, and statistics showing that Canada was below global averages for unauthorized music distribution, and had more Netflix subscribers per-capita than countries with site blocking rules in effect. The proposal was struck down by the CRTC, as copyright law is outside of its jurisdiction. On November 18, 2019, in the first ruling of its kind, the Federal Court of Canada approved an interlocutory injunction requiring major Canadian ISPs to block a pirate IPTV service. The court ruled that this did not violate net neutrality or freedom of expression. = Extremist content = In March 2019, following the Christchurch mosque shooting, Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Ralph Goodale stated that the Government was planning to carefully evaluate whether social media platforms should be required to censor hate speech and extremist content.  Employers and employees  Canadians can be disciplined by their employers for writing letters to newspapers. Christine St-Pierre, a television reporter covering federal politics for Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, was suspended in September 2006 for writing a letter in support of Canadian troops in Afghanistan.Dany Bouchard. Christine Saint-Pierre chass√©e d'Ottawa , Le Journal de Montr√©al, Sept. 08, 2006 Chris Kempling, a Canadian educator and counsellor, was suspended by the British Columbia College of Teachers and disciplined by the Quesnel School District for anti-gay comments in letters to the editor of the Quesnel Cariboo Observer. Canadian courts have upheld professional sanctions against teachers and school counsellors for writing letters to newspapers that are found to be discriminatory, limiting their freedom of expression and religion on the basis of maintaining \\"a school system that is free from bias, prejudice and intolerance.\\"\\"Ross v. New Brunswick School District No. 15\\", [1996] 1 S.C.R. 825. Judgements of the Supreme Court of Canada. Public servants Canadian public sector employees may be dismissed for criticizing the government, if the criticism reaches the point of impairing the public employee's ability to perform their functions. The requirement of the non- partisan federal public service is an important factor to take into account. For example, in Fraser v. Public Sector Staff Relations Board, the Supreme Court of Canada stated: > When one examines the substance of the criticisms (two major government > policies and the character and integrity of the Prime Minister and > Government), the context of those criticisms (prolonged, virtually full > time, in public meetings, on radio, on television, in newspapers, local, > national, international), and the form of the criticisms (initially > restrained, but increasingly vitriolic and vituperative) the Adjudicator's > conclusion that Mr. Fraser's ability to perform his own job and his > suitability to remain in the public service were both impaired was a fair > conclusion. Though no direct evidence of the fact of impairment of capacity > is required, here the evidence clearly established circumstances from which > the inference of impairment is clearly irresistible. Put simply, although > there is not an absolute prohibition against public servants criticizing > government policies, Mr. Fraser in this case went much too far.Fraser v. > PSSRB, [1985 2 SCR 455, para. 50] Employees who are disciplined have the right to have the discipline reviewed through workplace arbitration, which in fact was offered to Fraser, but he declined: > There was a disagreement there. The employee wanted to speak out. The > employer said that he could not. The employee persisted. The employer > suspended him. But that is not all the employer did. The employer recognized > that the employee was taking a principled stand. Accordingly, the employer > offered to expedite the grievance procedure, provided the employee would > cease his criticism. The employee refused. He decided to continue, and in > fact greatly expanded, his criticism of the Government. In doing this, it > seems to me, he voluntarily assumed the risk that his conduct might be > adjudged to be sufficient cause for the initial suspension or for subsequent > disciplinary action.Fraser v PSSRB, para. 52.  Human rights laws  The Canadian Human Rights Act formerly prohibited hate messages in telecommunications under federal jurisdiction, such as broadcasting and the internet. Section 13 of the Act prohibited making a statement by telecommunication which \\"is likely to expose a person or persons to 'hatred or contempt' by reason of the fact that that person or those persons are identifiable on the basis of a prohibited ground of discrimination.\\" Those prohibited grounds of discrimination are on the basis of race, national or ethnic origin, colour, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, family status, disability or conviction for an offence for which a pardon has been granted.Section 13(1), Canadian Human Rights Act (CHRA) , 1977, Canadian Human Rights Commission, Retrieved February 26, 2013 Provinces such as British Columbia and Alberta have extended this prohibition to all publications. In 1990, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the constitutionality of s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.Canada (Human Rights Commission) v. Taylor, [1990] 3 SCR 892. In the mid-2000s, there was a series of high-profile cases involving s. 13, and the related provincial provisions. For example, Marc Lemire and Paul Fromm challenged the constitutionality of s. 13. In September 2009 the Canadian Human Rights Tribunal ruled that s. 13 violated Canadians' charter rights to freedom of expression.\\"Hate-speech law violates Charter rights, tribunal rules \\", Susan Krashinsky, The Globe and Mail, 2 September 2009. However, that ruling was overturned on appeal by the Federal Court of Appeal, which found that s. 13 continued to be constitutionally valid.Joseph Brean, \\"Court finds Internet hate law Section 13 to be constitutionally valid, doesn't violate freedom of expression\\", National Post, February 2, 2014. In 2008 the Alberta Human Rights Commission held hearings on a complaint against former publisher Ezra Levant after the Western Standard published the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons depicting Muhammad. The complaint was ultimately withdrawn, and a complaint filed with Calgary police came to naught. An identical complaint by the Edmonton Muslim Council was dismissed by the Alberta Commission in August 2008. In 2008, three complaints were filed in three different jurisdictions against Mark Steyn and Maclean's magazine for publishing excerpts from Steyn's book, America Alone, which the complainants said were offensive to Muslims. All three complaints were dismissed: the Ontario Human Rights Commission declared it lacked jurisdiction;\\"Commission statement concerning issues raised by complaints against Maclean's Magazine, Ontario Human rights Commission, 9 April 2008. the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal dismissed the complaint;Macdonald, Neil. \\"Free Speech, Eh? Why Is Canada Prosecuting Mark Steyn?\\".

The Steyn / Maclean's case has been cited as a motivating factor in the June 2013 repeal of s. 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\\"Good riddance to Section 13 of the Canadian Human Rights Act\\" , Jonathan Kay, National Post, 7 June 2012. In 2011, Keith Martin, a Liberal Member of Parliament from British Columbia, introduced a motion that called for the repeal of s. 13, arguing that it violated freedom of expression, guaranteed by s. 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Martin said that hate crimes, slander and libel would still be outlawed under the Criminal Code, while his motion would stop the federal human rights tribunal from imposing restrictions on freedom of speech using taxpayers' money. \\"We have laws against hate crimes, but nobody has a right not to be offended,\\" he said. \\"[This provision] is being used in a way that the authors of the Act never envisioned.\\" Following the 2011 election, Brian Storseth, a Conservative Member of Parliament from Alberta, introduced a private member's bill to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act, including the repeal of s. 13. The bill passed both Houses of Parliament and received royal assent on June 26, 2013. It came into force a year later, June 26, 2014.An Act to amend the Canadian Human Rights Act (protecting freedom), SC 2013, c. 37 In 2016, the Human Rights Tribunal of Quebec ordered comedian Mike Ward to pay $42,000 to the family of J√©r√©my Gabriel, a disabled public figure whose physical appearance Ward had mocked. Ward's lawyer, Julius Grey, began the appeal process shortly after the ruling. Criticism of Canadian censorship Canada's 22nd Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, prior to becoming Prime Minister, stated \\"Human rights commissions, as they are evolving, are an attack on our fundamental freedoms and the basic existence of a democratic society ‚Ä¶ It is in fact totalitarianism. I find this is very scary stuff.\\"BC Report Newsmagazine , January 11, 1999 PEN Canada, an organization which assists writers who are persecuted for peaceful expression, has called on \\"the federal and provincial governments to change human rights commission legislation to ensure commissions can no longer be used to attempt to restrict freedom of expression in Canada.\\"\\"PEN Canada Calls for Changes to Human Rights Commission Legislation\\" , PEN Canada as posted by the Society for Academic Freedom and Scholarship, February 4, 2008 According to Mary Agnes Welch, president of the Canadian Association of Journalists, \\"[h]uman rights commissions were never intended to act as a form of thought police, but now they're being used to chill freedom of expression on matters that are well beyond accepted Criminal Code restrictions on free speech.\\" A group of several dozen professors from the 7,000-member American Political Science Association contend that recent free speech precedents in Canada put academics at risk of prosecution. The group includes Robert George and Harvey Mansfield, and they have protested holding the scheduled 2009 APSA annual meeting in Canada for this reason.\\"Academics fear speaking freely in Canada\\", Kevin Libin, National Post, August 23, 2008, retrieved Sept 5, 2014 The leadership of APSA selected Toronto as the meeting location. There have been multiple lawsuits claiming that censorship violates multiple basic human rights, such as Section 2 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms which protects the fundamental freedoms of thought, belief, and opinion. These accusations have been of the violation of the rights and freedoms through certain types of censorship.

He appeared as himself and as \\"Handyman Negri\\" in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe segments on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood. He appeared on the 1959 children's television program Adventure Time and with Johnny Costa on the 1954 TV series 67 Melody Lane hosted by Ken Griffin. Negri taught jazz guitar for 49 years at the University of Pittsburgh, where jazz guitar was first offered as a discipline in higher education. He taught for 46 years at Duquesne University, as well as at Carnegie Mellon University. Biography Joe Negri began performing on radio at age three, playing the ukulele and singing. He joined the local musicians' union and began playing professional engagements. In the 1940s, he toured nationally and was a member of the Shep Fields Orchestra for several years. Then he entered the Army for two years. After returning home, he performed in Pittsburgh with his brother, pianist Lonfellow Negri. He enrolled at Carnegie Mellon University, concentrated on music composition, and taught guitar to students, including Ralph Patt, the inventor of major-thirds tuning.: Negri and Patt recorded in 1989. Negri spent the next twenty-two years working in television as music director. He met Fred Rogers and appeared as a regular, Handyman Negri, in the children's program Mister Rogers' Neighborhood for nearly 40 years. In 2010 he recorded an album with Michael Feinstein and performed with him during the next year at the Newport Jazz Festival. Negri was the subject of a profile in the September 2010 issue of Vintage Guitar magazine. Joe Negri archives The Joe Negri archives consist of the collection of manuscripts, recordings, memorabilia, and original hand-written scores that document his life, work and influence. The collection was donated by Negri in 1999 to the Center for American Music within the University Library System (ULS) at the University of Pittsburgh. The donation became the 1,000th collection at the ULS to have an electronically accessible finding aid (i.e., a guide that describes the contents of an archival collection and creator). The archives contains correspondence, commissioned commercial musical compositions, scores, recordings and television archival footage. His donation also included his college coursework, compositions written for the River City Brass Band, television scores, commercial jingles, and film work. Companies that commissioned work from Negri included McDonald's, Alcoa, Kaufmann's, and Westinghouse.

The 2310, their current OEM model, is the only tremolo to offer the aluminum cam - though parts are interchangeable - and offers brass rollers. Steel rollers can also be used. Kahler also produces a bass tremolo system. The first two bridges Kahler sold after their return in 2005 were 2410 bass tremolos. Guitars that have carved tops (as opposed to flat, like the Fender Stratocaster), such as the Gibson Les Paul, cannot properly mount the 2300 series of Kahler tremolo, and instead have to use a stud-mounted 2200 series. For a period spanning from the mid-1980s to the time when Kahler ceased production in the early 1990s, Kahler also produced fulcrum-based systems similar to the Floyd Rose brand of tremolos. The 2600 \\"Steeler\\" tremolo was licensed to Kahler by Floyd Rose during the late-1980s. The 2500 and 2520 (the former having steel rollers; the latter brass), were designed as an alternative to the stock Fender tremolo system, and were offered on several Fenders during the 1980s. Today, Kahler no longer produces fulcrum-based tremolos. Neal Moser offers Kahler bridges on many models, and the Jackson and ESP Custom Shops currently offer Kahlers as a custom option. ESP and B.C. Rich also offer the Kahler X-TREM on their more affordable signature models for Jeff Hanneman and Kerry King respectively. ESP and B.C. Rich offer the Kahler Hybrid model on their mid-range guitars such as LTD JH-600 and B.C. Rich Wartribe, both with EMG pickups. Gibson has included the Kahler system on limited edition guitars such as the Gibson Shred-X Explorer and the Gibson Tribal Explorer. Peavey's PXD Void III and Twenty- Three III guitars also feature the Kahler system. Because they are suitable for left handed as well as right handed guitars, Gaskell Guitars offers all Kahler models on their custom left handed guitar builds.

As a political activist in the early 20th century, Granell was characterised by his outspoken support of Democratic Socialism and opposition to Totalitarianism. Eugenio joined the Trotskyists during his military service and eventually became a prominent member of POUM (Partido Obrero de Unificaci√≥n Marxista / Worker‚Äôs Party of Marxist Unification) in 1935. Following the Civil War, Granell fled to France where he was interned in concentration camps however after having escaped, Eugenio then sought exile in the Americas. As a Surrealist Artist, Eugenio's work is principally characterised by its bright and vivid colours that explore nature and the indigenous symbolism of the Americas. His most famous works include Autorretrato (1944), Eleg√≠a por Andr√©s Nin (1991) as well as Cr√≥nica de los fiscales de los a√±os horrendos (1986). Granell's work has been incorporated into exhibitions in the Maeght Gallery, the Bodley Gallery, The Museum of Modern Art as well as The Museum of Contemporary Art alongside other Surrealists such as Andr√© Breton and Marcel Duchamp. Granell also dedicated himself as a poet, essayist and novelist, publishing 15 books in all. Some his first, and most prominent works, include 'El hombre Verde' (The Green Man, 1944) and 'Lo que sucedi√≥' (What Occurred), a book he illustrated and designed himself which won Mexico's Don Quijote novel prize in 1969. From the mid-1960s until retirement, he was professor of Spanish literature at Brooklyn College. The Eugenio Granell Foundation was inaugurated in 1995 to conserve the life and work of the artist with an expansive collection of his oils, drawings, constructions, collages and archives. The museum also dedicates itself to the preservation of other Surrealists such as Joan Mir√≥, Wifredo Lam, Jos√© Caballero, William Copley, Esteban Franc√©s, Marcel Duchamp and Pablo Picasso.  Early life  Born in Galicia, in the city of A Coru√±a, Eugenio Fern√°ndez Granell started out as a musician and political radical. In his youth he and his brother Mario, as well as other friends, set up the magazine SIR (Sociedad Infantil Revolucionaria). In 1928, Granell enrolled at the Escuela Superior de M√∫sica del Real Conservatorio in Madrid. Among his friends were Maruja Mallo, Joaqu√≠n Torres Garc√≠a, Alberto S√°nchez Wifredo Lam and Ricardo Baroja and as a member of the POUM during the Civil War, Eugenio contributed actively to newspapers such as La Nueva Era, La Batalla and El Combatiente Rojo. In 1939, he went into exile and after arriving in France, he was held in internment camps for several months, but was eventually able to escape to Paris. While in the French capital, he continued the friendships with Benjamin P√©ret and Wifredo Lam which had started in Madrid prior to the civil war. Granell's affiliation with Trotsky made him the enemy of Fascists and Stalinists and steered him towards a life marked by exile and escape. As Mar√≠a Zambrano stated regarding Spain in the early twentieth century, the country was a \\"master of dispersal and wastefulness\\" as it forced many of its most outstanding artists and intellectuals into a painful flight to other countries. Granell was one of those exiles, residing in France, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Guatemala and New York City. In the Dominican Republic, he was in the company of other Spanish exiles, including artists Jos√© Vela Zanetti and Josep Gausachs and writers like Vlady Serge, Segundo Derrano Poncela, Vicente Llorens. Granell began his life as a painter in the Dominican Republic. He also continued to play the violin at the National Symphony which he had helped create with the musician Enrique Chap√≠, another refugee from Spain. When Andr√© Breton arrived in the island for a short visit, he liked Granell's paintings and encouraged him to continue. Breton also admired the magazine which Granell, Alberto Baeza Flores (a politician from Chile) and several Dominican writers had created: \\"La Poes√≠a Sorprendida\\". Granell left an important legacy in the arts in this Caribbean island.  The Dominican Republic  When Granell arrived in the Dominican Republic in 1940, he had not yet discovered his talent for painting. Initially he worked as a violinist with the National Symphony Orchestra, which he helped organize with the musician Casal Chap√≠ and as a journalist for the newspaper La Naci√≥n. In 1941 he began painting, participating in an exhibit entitled Private Exhibit of Modern Spanish Painters in 1942. Granell had his first solo exhibition in 1943, exhibiting 44 Surrealist paintings, this was the first exhibition of Surrealist works held in the country. He had another solo exhibition in 1945 featuring 200 of his works and in 1946 he exhibited in Puerto Rico and Guatemala. Later that same year, he left the Dominican Republic due to problems that arose when he refused to sign a document supporting the dictator Trujillo. Granell, along with poets from the Dominican Republic and the Chilean diplomat Alberto Baeza Flores, was also responsible for the creation of the magazine \\"La Poes√≠a Sorpendida\\".  Guatemala and Puerto Rico  In 1946, Granell left the Dominican Republic for Mexico where he was going to work with his party comrade Costa Amic. But landing in Guatemala, Eugenio and his wife Amparo liked Guatemala City and decided to stay. Once there, he became an art professor, contributed to magazines and had a radio show in which he talked about art and artists, among other subjects. He also continued his painting and writing. His stay in Guatemala was cut short when the revolution began and he was seen as an anti communist. Jaime Ben√≠tez, the Rector of the University of Puerto Rico, had met Granell when he had shown his art on the island a few years earlier and invited him and his family to move to Puerto Rico and become an art professor at the University. His stay on the island was very productive. He ignited interest in contemporary art in his students and many continued to paint and at some point had created a group called \\"El Mirador Azul\\". Some of these students included: Juan Maisonet, Rafael Ferrer, Frances del valle, Rosado, Cosette Zeno, and the poet \\"El Boquio\\". As he did in the Dominican Republic, Granell left a school of art on the island.  New York  In 1952, Granell traveled to New York with his friend Jos√© Vela Zanetti, a fellow Spanish exile whom he met in the Dominican Republic. Once there, through Vela Zanetti, he met and developed a strong friendship with Marcel Duchamp. In 1957, after a sabbatical, Granell and his family moved to New York and lived mainly on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York, until 1985 when the Granell family returned to Spain. It was here that Granell held several exhibits at the Bodley Gallery; some were solo shows, others were group shows with surrealists like Magritte, Max Ernst, and Duchamp. He studied sociology at the New School for Social Research and earned his PhD with the publication of a very personal study of Picasso's Guernica: \\"Picasso's Guernica. The End of a Spanish Era\\" (UMI Research Press, 1967 and 1981). Granell was Professor Emeritus of Spanish Literature at City University of New York (CUNY).  Return to Spain  In 1985, Granell returned to Spain, where he was awarded numerous prizes and acknowledgements such as the 'Gold Medal of Fine Arts', awarded by the Council of Ministers as well as the 'Pablo Iglesias Award for the Arts' in 1995. The Eugenio Granell Foundation was created in 1995 in his home town Santiago de Compostela, Spain. The only museum in the world entirely devoted to surrealism which holds some 600 of his paintings along with works by Picabia, Duchamp, Man Ray, Joan Mir√≥, Esteban Franc√©s, Philip West among many others. Granell also published several books in Spain, including \\"La novela del Indio Tupinamba\\", a surrealist, personal and unique vision of the Spanish Civil War. It has since been translated into English and published by City Lights. Another important publication is \\"Isla cofre m√≠tico\\", dedicated to Andr√© Breton and his wife Elise whom he had met in the Dominican Republic in 1941, a truly lasting friendship. The Eugenio Granell Foundation was created in Santiago de Compostela in 1995. Situated in Plaza del Toral in the historic centre, Granell donated many of his own works (oils, drawings, constructions, found objects), as well as his collection of works by other surrealist artists. His Library and archives are also found in the Foundation. Granell died in Madrid in 2001. An important part of his personal archive is located in the Pavell√≥ de la Rep√∫blica CRAI Library - University of Barcelona and consists of press clippings about Spanish Civil War, Exile, Francoism, POUM, and cultural activities. But most of his archives can be found at the Eugenio Granell Foundation. Granell's Work Although springing from the depths of his subconscious like that of all the surrealists, Granell‚Äôs work is influenced by the places where he lived, particularly the exuberance of the Caribbean and the blend of Spanish and native cultures. Surrealism recognises no social function of art other than that of liberating the individual and society from the repression of reason, allowing the creator to express his instincts and dreams. In 1959, Andr√© Breton organized an exhibit called The Homage to Surrealism Exhibition to celebrate the Fortieth Anniversary of Surrealism which exhibited works by Salvador Dal√≠, Joan Mir√≥, Enrique T√°bara and Eugenio Granell. Granell's, Formation of Metaforia, Oil on Cardboard, 1975.There is absolutely no censorship in Granell's work. Poetry blossoms, shrouding unrecognisable figures where trees, animals and people merge into hybrid beings that undergo constant metamorphosis. Works where the strong colours are framed in sculptural compositions, in human figures on the verge of formal delirium, or in voluptuous compositions that appear to be a microscopic dimension of an unknown world. Playfulness, advocated by the surrealists as an expression of freedom, pervades the whole of this artist‚Äôs work. Granell‚Äôs dialogue and writing have always ironically mocked solemnity and reason itself. Such are his painting, his sculpture and his readymades: an extremely beautiful elegy to freedom and the purity of feelings. The major books on Granell and his work, such as monographs and catalogues, are mostly in Spanish or Galician, but they are widely available in libraries throughout the world, including the United States. All of the catalogues of Granell's exhibits published by the Fundaci√≥n Granell, are also written in English. Granell also published a book of meditations and critical reflections on Picasso's Guernica, and this book is available in English as well as in Spanish and Galician (see \\"References\\" section). Works by Granell are on display in major museums, including the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Reina Sof√≠a Museum in Madrid.

One of Venezuela's most prominent politicians on the left, Petkoff began as a communist but gravitated toward liberalism in the 1990s. As Minister of Planning, he oversaw President Rafael Caldera's adoption of neoliberal economic policies in the mid-1990s. He was a prominent critic of President Hugo Ch√°vez and was a candidate to run against him in the 2006 presidential election until he dropped out four months before the vote to support Manuel Rosales. Petkoff launched the newspaper Tal Cual in 2000 and remained its editor until his death in 2018. Life and career =Early years= His father was a Bulgarian emigrant and his mother was a Pole of Jewish origin. He received a Bachelor degree in Economics from the Central University of Venezuela (UCV) where he also served as a professor for 14 years. In the 1950s he was member of the student resistance against the dictator Marcos P√©rez Jim√©nez and was imprisoned on several occasions. In the 1960s, along with his brother Luben Petkoff he was a guerrilla fighter under the command of Douglas Bravo against the government of R√≥mulo Betancourt. Later, he joined the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV). In 1971, Petkoff left the PCV to found, along with other dissidents, the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS). He was a member of Congress and twice an unsuccessful candidate for president, gaining 4% in the 1983 presidential election and 3% in the 1988 presidential election. =Minister of Rafael Caldera= In the second government of Rafael Caldera (1994-1999), MAS was in coalition with the centrist National Convergence party of Caldera, along with other left-wing parties such as the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV) and the MEP, and other right-wing parties as the National Movement of Integration. Petkoff served as Minister of the Central Office of Coordination and Planning (Cordiplan), directing the government's economic policies. From Cordiplan, Petkoff managed the Venezuela Agenda, a neo-liberal government program for reducing the size of the public administration, controlling inflation and stopping the currency devaluation, while administering social programs aimed at improving the population's nutritional health and providing \\"children-mother\\" services for the poorest. =Opponent of Hugo Ch√°vez= In 1998, Petkoff left the MAS because he was against its support of Hugo Ch√°vez's candidacy (see ) in the 1998 Presidential election. He left the political world and became a journalist, working as a director of El Mundo. Afterward, he founded his own newspaper, Tal Cual. Tal Cual has been outspoken in its criticism of both Chavismo and those who supported the 2002 coup attempt against Ch√°vez. Petkoff wrote several political books. In 2005 he published The Two Lefts (Las dos izquierdas, Alfadil Editor, Hogueras Collection) where he analyzed the resurgence of left-wing politics in Latin America. Petkoff argued that there was a sharp difference between the governments of Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva, N√©stor Kirchner, and Ricardo Lagos, compared to the governments of Ch√°vez and Castro, which he characterises as similar. The main ideas can be read in an article published in the journal New Society (Nueva Sociedad) in Spanish (see Las dos izquierdas). On 21 April 2006, after rumours indicating that a number of intellectuals and middle-class liberal activists had asked him to run in the 2006 Presidential election, Teodoro Petkoff launched his campaign to be the next president of Venezuela. In a short televised message he explained his reasons and asked Venezuelans to follow his lead in the construction of what he described as a new, better Venezuela. On 4 August 2006, Petkoff dropped out of the presidential race. Five days after dropping out of the race, he endorsed Manuel Rosales, former governor of Zulia State, for the presidency. In July 2008 the Inter-American Dialogue published a paper by Petkoff about Venezuela under Ch√°vez, saying ‚ÄúCh√°vez‚Äôs Venezuela is a Bonapartist democracy of sorts, a one-of-a-kind 'dictatorship.' He aims to make the armed forces the institutional base of his power.‚Äù In an October 2012 interview, Petkoff noted that while Venezuela under Ch√°vez retained certain democratic institutions, such as political parties and the electoral process, he described other aspects of democracy, such as ‚Äúthe full exercise of freedom of expression,‚Äù as being ‚Äúvery beleaguered‚Äù under Ch√°vez. He said that ‚ÄúCh√°vez has more fascist than socialist elements, unless we speak of Stalinism: the cult of violence and death, contempt for opponents, singing to the past, and so on.‚Äù =Personal life= On 12 May 2012, Petkoff and his wife were mugged by an armed man on a motorcycle after leaving a Caracas restaurant. In December 2012, while on the island of Margarita, Petkoff suffered a fall and sustained injuries that required surgery. Petkoff died on 31 October 2018.

It is located from the center of Paris. The commune of Bry-sur-Marne is part of the sector of Porte de Paris, one of the four sectors of the \\"new town\\" of Marne-la-Vall√©e. History =Prehistory and early history= Bry's name comes from the Celtic word Briw, which means a bridge or a river crossing. The area has been inhabited since Neolithic times. Official town web page on the town's history The town's motto, which features on its coat of arms, is \\"Moult viel que Paris\\" - old French for \\"Much older than Paris\\". Official town web page on the coat of arms In 1903, archeologist Adrien Mentienne uncovered the bones of a large bovine which died 15,000 years ago. In 1982, the skeleton of a woman who died in the 5th century BC was uncovered beneath the playground of a school in Bry. It is now housed in the town's museum. From that century onwards, there was a permanent human presence where Bry now stands. In 1886, a necropolis was found which contained pottery, Gaul and Frankish weaponry, silver and gold jewelry, and coins, dating from the Gaul era to the Merovingian. The first known written mention of the town named Bry was in a charter signed by King Charles the Bald in 861. The first church was built in 1130. =From the feudal era to modern times= In 1404, Robert de Ch√¢tillon, cousin of King Charles VI, was Bry's feudal lord. His castle no longer stands, and its exact location is uncertain. Bry's current ch√¢teau was built in the 1690s. It became the town hall in 1866. It was rebuilt after the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. The railway came to Bry in 1926, followed by the motorway (1970) and the RER (1977). The town's hospital was built in 1936.see reference note n¬∞1 Population Education The commune has one public preschool, Maternelle Jules Ferry; three combined public preschools and elementary schools, La P√©pini√®re, Paul Barilliet, and Louis Daguerre; as well as one public elementary school, Henri Cahn.\\"Les √©coles.\\" Bry-sur-Marne.

A BBC Micro port was released the same year, Acorn Electron, Amstrad CPC (through Amsoft) and MSX in 1984, Commodore 16 and Plus/4 in 1985 and Amstrad PCW in 1987. In some countries this game was released under the name Gangster. Son of Blagger, was released in 1984 with a third and final title Blagger Goes to Hollywood released in 1985. Another sequel, known as New Blagger but developed as Blagger 2, being a direct continuation of the original, was produced in 1985 but not released.http://bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=380 Gameplay Blagger includes platforms, ladders, conveyor belts, keys and baddies. The game is divided into a series of single-screen levels. The goal of the player on each screen is to manipulate Blagger, a burglar, to collect the scattered keys and then reach the safe. The keys must be collected and the safe opened in a limited amount of time. Blagger can walk left and right, and jump left, right and up. The jumping action is in a fixed pattern and cannot be altered once initiated. Gameplay involves learning the best order in which to collect the keys, and good timing of movement and jumping. Not all platforms are permanent; some decay once Blagger has stepped on them. Other platforms serve to move Blagger in a particular direction. Blagger will die if he touches cacti, one of the moving enemy obstacles of the level, or if he falls more than a certain distance. The moving enemies vary from level to level, and include cars, aliens, mad hatters, and giant mouths. The movement of the enemies is in a fixed pattern, generally travelling from one point to another and back again.

These films are typically preceded by the disclaimer, \\"This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen and edited for content,\\" or some minor variant thereof. Reasons for this type of editing may range from the distributor's demands to accommodating different audience groups. Fan-made movie edits are often met with controversy, as they bring up issues of copyright law. Types of re-editing There are three main types of film editing: format, length, and content. * Format ‚Äì Feature films are commonly produced in a widescreen 1.85:1 aspect ratio or 2.40:1 aspect ratio. which is different from the screen formats currently utilized for television transmissions‚Äîa standard 1.33:1 (or 4:3) aspect ratio for analog or standard- definition television broadcasts and the growing standard of 1.77:1 (or 16:9) aspect ratio for digital television broadcasts. Prior to the beginning of a film presented in the 4:3 aspect ratio on VHS tapes or DVDs, a disclaimer appears (mainly over a black background), reading, This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen. Since the adoption of the high-definition television resolution standard, some theatrical films intended for 2.39 or 2.40 aspect ratios have been reframed for 1.78 (16:9) for television and home video, and also require the modification warning as per Directors Guild of America (DGA) rules. * Length ‚Äì Films may be shortened for television broadcasts (principally on advertiser- supported networks and terrestrial stations to accommodate commercial advertising) or for use on airlines. DVD releases of films may also contain longer cuts. In recent years, a growing number of feature films are being released in an Unrated cut, incorporating scenes that may have been excluded from the film's original theatrical prints. If a film has scenes edited to fit its designated timeslot, prior to the beginning of a re-edited film's television airing, an additional notice indicating that the film has been edited \\"to run in the time allotted\\" will be included in the format disclaimer screen. An increasingly common practice for length-edited films shown on advertiser-supported television networks is for the film's end credits to sometimes be sped up to accommodate succeeding programs, or to free up more airtime for advertisements. * Content ‚Äì Some films have content deemed \\"objectionable\\" to \\"family audiences\\", namely sexual content (including nudity, regardless of its intent to be sexual in nature, and depictions of sexual activity), obscene language, graphic violence, illicit drug use and perceived racial insensitivity. To make these films suitable for younger or more typical audiences, or to appeal to advertisers when a film is shown on ad-supported broadcast television or basic cable services, alternative versions are created with such content removed or replaced. Often, profanities are substituted with minced oaths through automated dialogue replacement (ADR) or are muted entirely. The editing of these versions is performed by a censor and not the producer or director of the work. In addition, a film is often edited if it originally received a NC-17 (No one 17 and under admitted) rating from the Motion Picture Association (MPA, formerly the Motion Picture Association of America or MPAA), as NC-17 rated films are not screened at mainstream cinemas or advertised on television. Therefore, studios will often re-edit the film to achieve an R rating instead. Re-editing techniques There are two main techniques for re-editing films: =Manual re-editing= Purchased film content is downloaded onto an editing work station's hard drive and are manually re-edited by third-party editors to remove objectionable content from the video and audio tracks. The re-edited version is then copied onto media (VHS or DVD) and made available for rental or purchase, provided an original version has been purchased in correlation with the re-edited copy. Some manual re-edits are done by fans (see The Phantom Edit) to cut a film to their own ‚Äì or their peers ‚Äì specifications. Although a 2006 lower court ruling prohibits businesses from manually re-editing commercial films, the law still allows for individuals to self-censor and edit their own films for personal use. =Programmed re-editing= Programmed re-editing occurs when software (such as that employed in a DVD player) is used to skip portions of the video and/or audio content on-the-fly, according to pre-programmed instruction sets that are knowingly used by the consumer. Opening disclaimers In any case, theatrical films that aired on television in the 1970s and for most of the 1980s would simply have an \\"Edited For Television\\" disclaimer superimposed right after the opening credits, or, in a few cases, superimposed over the movie title card itself, just below the title. However, today, when a theatrical film or television special is aired on network or syndicated television or is re-issued on video in a form different from its original version, variations of the following disclaimers appear: * \\"This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen.\\" * \\"The following film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen.\\" * \\"This film has been modified as follows from its original version: It has been formatted to fit your screen.\\" * Depending on whether a television print of a film contains edits for content and time, the disclaimer will include additional text: \\"...to run in the time allotted and for content.\\" or \\"...and to run in the time allotted.\\" or \\"...and edited for content.\\" * Disney films prepared for television by Disney-ABC Domestic Television and other select television stations will have the following variants: \\"This film has been edited for television\\", or \\"This film has been modified from its original version. It has been edited for television and formatted to fit this screen.\\" * Many DVD releases that contain versions of films differing from their theatrical releases (such as with Universal Studios Home Video's director's cut DVD release of Legend) will have this disclaimer: \\"This film has been modified from its original version to include additional material not in the original release.\\" * For black-and-white films that have been colorized, a disclaimer noting these alterations will often be included in the vein as follows: \\"This is a colorized version of a film originally marketed and distributed to the public in black and white. It has been altered without the participation of the principal director, screenwriter, and other creators of the original film.\\" History of manual re-editing Early cases of this practice date back to Germany's occupation by the Nazis, who regularly stole prints of American movies from European countries during their Blitzkrieg raids. They would then either cheaply reanimate the movie (see Hochzeit im Korallenmeer), or would change the names of production staff listed in the credits (as with Max and David Fleischer's cartoon shorts). As theatrical movies began to air on television, networks successfully sought permission to air shortened versions of movies. The television edits of theatrical films had sections or the entirety of scenes cut out, in order to provide a print length that could fit within a fixed number of multiple half-hour time slots (often four half-hour slots). This also allowed scenes unsuitable for television broadcast (such as those including depictions of sexual activity or graphic violence) to be cut or trimmed. On the other hand, networks would also often add footage deleted from a film's theatrical release to pad out a certain running time (usually three to four hours in length). In response to consumer demand, families began to re-edit purchased VHS tapes manually by making cuts and splices to the tape. A hotbed for this activity has been Utah with its conservative and entrepreneurial population. When Titanic was released on VHS in the winter of 1998, a video store owner in Utah began offering to re-edit purchased copies of the film for a $5 service fee. The service became very popular, and before long, several video rental businesses purchased VHS tapes and had them re- edited for their rental club/co-op members to watch. At the end of the 1990s, some small companies began selling copies of movies, without the scenes containing violent and/or indecent content, or foul language, to appeal to family audiences. By 2003, the major American film studios and individual filmmakers reacted against these unauthorized modifications, considering them to be a destruction of the filmmakers' work, and a violation of the controls that an author has over their work. Famed film directors and producers, such as Steven Spielberg, publicly criticized this practice in entertainment industry publications. When DVD technology emerged, the re-editing industry began offering a disabled DVD accompanied by a re-edited version of the film on a coupled DVD-R for sale or rental. Several companies attempted this business, with some trying to do this through physical brick and mortar stores. The most successful of these proprietors of re-edited film content was Utah-based CleanFlicks, Inc., which utilized a unique deal model and proprietary stores to output the inventory. Clean Films later became the largest and most successful company in the business by employing an online rental model (similar to Netflix) and avoiding employing any physical stores. After a CleanFlicks franchisee in Colorado pre-emptively sued several major film directors out of concern that the guild (citing a notice on the DGA's website that inferred such a lawsuit was pending) were going to sue, the Directors Guild of America and the Motion Picture Association of America filed a countersuit against CleanFlicks and CleanFilms‚Äîwhile including several other distributors of edited DVD prints of theatrical features‚Äîarguing that the re- editing of their originally distributed work resulted in a derivation on a fixed media in violation of copyright. In 2006, Judge Richard P. Matsch of the United States District Court for the District of Colorado ruled that CleanFilms, CleanFlicks and other edited film distributors was a copyright violation to distribute re-edited films without the consent from the film studios. The key was the fixed media aspect of the businesses; at all times, for instance, CleanFilms sold edited films with a legitimately purchased original copy. Furthermore, every edited DVD rental unit sold direct-to- customer had a corresponding original copy that was purchased at retail. ClearPlay was not affected by this ruling, as they did not sell fixed media, and editing took place as the unaltered streamed media was altered by the consumer's control of ClearPlay's software. In an odd twist, despite Judge Matsch's decision and his order that the re-editing companies to destroy all their re-edited inventory, shortly after the studios' victory in the Denver court, the lawyers for the studios negotiated with lawyers for the re-editing companies allowing for the sale of existing inventory. In an unexpected investor outcome given the loss of a major infringement case, one of the companies in the first three days of a \\"going out of business sale\\" generated more than a quarter of a million dollars in revenue and eventually sold enough re-edited movies to provide their original investors a return on investment worth five times or better the ROI. Less controversial than external bodies editing movies were the rise of director's cut editions of movies, which flourished with the advent of DVDs. These restore‚Äîand occasionally also shorten or omit (as in the case of Alien)‚Äîscenes or footage from movies that had been left out of the theatrical print for varying reasons (including studio interference with the directors creative vision, inability to finish what was intended due to technology, or even the reactions of test audiences). History of programmed re-editing ClearPlay was sued by the DGA and MPAA, but the case was rendered moot by the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005, which clarified that ClearPlay's filtering approach was legal and did not violate copyright law. As a result, ClearPlay has been able to offer its products to consumers in the United States, while others have discontinued distribution of edited home video releases for legal reasons. Another aspect of re-editing comes with consumer made edits; the practice of fan edits (or fanedits)‚Äîwhich have become more popular as they have spread over the internet‚Äîinvolves consumers loading the filmed content into their computers and using video editing software to produce mostly a version with content changed for their own entertainment. Future of the industry It is unclear where this industry is headed. An April 2005 poll conducted by ABC News indicated continued demand for the product. Of 1,002 adults from across the United States sampled for the poll, 39% of those polled expressed interest in purchasing re-edited films, while 58% of respondents said that they would not be interested in making such a purchase (with a three-point error margin). Despite the aforementioned legal rulings, companies continue to sell re-edited movies via the Internet, some of which have been shut down in accordance with the reasoning of the 2006 decision by the Colorado District Court. Even still, online search engine results reveal that companies continue to provide fixed media products, such as Clean Play DVDs. Sometimes, these re-sellers use \\"going out of business\\" tactics to move inventory. However, physical \\"brick and mortar\\" stores have been shut down, such as Cougar Video in Provo, Utah, which remained open long after the named companies in the aforementioned lawsuit were closed down. One company, Swank, offers re-edited movies created by the studios themselves, supposedly for showings in correctional facilities and other non-theatrical locations. It is not clear if these versions are the same re-edited versions that studios create for airlines or television showings.

The sequel was later enhanced with bitmapped graphics, color, and improved descriptions, and released simply as Asylum in for the Atari 8-bit family in 1983, and Commodore 64 and IBM PC in 1985. Plot The story takes place in a labyrinthine asylum. One rather confusing feature of that labyrinth is that some sections of it seem to exist in several places at once. So an item dropped in a certain place will also show up in another place of the labyrinth, in a corridor of the same shape (but different orientation), and vice versa. Reception Debuting in February 1981, the game sold 5,000 copies by June 1982, appearing on Computer Gaming Worlds list of top sellers. BYTE stated that \\"Not only is [Asylum] a devious game, it is a very good buy for the money\\". PC Magazine stated that the game's use of graphics \\"is one of the features that makes it more exciting than Adventure\\". While criticizing its copy protection, the reviewer liked the time limit and stated that her daughter found the game \\"cool\\".

A relative price may be expressed in terms of a ratio between the prices of any two goods or the ratio between the price of one good and the price of a market basket of goods (a weighted average of the prices of all other goods available in the market). A relative price is an opportunity cost. Microeconomics can be seen as the study of how economic agents react to changes in relative prices, and of how relative prices are affected by the behavior of those agents. In a demand equation In the demand equation Q = f(P) (in which Q is the number of units of a good or service demanded), P is the relative price of the good or service rather than the nominal price. It is the change in a relative price that prompts a change in the quantity demanded. For example, if all prices rise by 10% there is no change in any relative prices, so if consumers' nominal income and wealth also go up by 10% leaving real income and real wealth unchanged, then demand for each good or service will be unaffected. But if the price of a particular good goes up by, say, 2% while the prices of the other goods and services go down enough that the overall price level is unchanged, then the relative price of the particular good has increased while purchasing power has been unaffected, so the quantity of the good demanded will go down. Budget constraint and indifference curves Example of a substitution effect In the graphical rendition of the theory of consumer choice, as shown in the accompanying graph, the consumer‚Äôs choice of the optimal quantities to demand of two goods is the point of tangency between an indifference curve (curved) and the budget constraint (a straight line). The graph shows an initial budget constraint BC1 with resulting choice at tangency point A, and a new budget constraint after a decrease in the absolute price of Y (the good whose quantity is shown horizontally), with resulting choice at tangency point C. In each case the absolute value of the slope of the budget constraint is the ratio of the price of good Y to the price of good X ‚Äì that is, the relative price of good Y in terms of X. Distinguishing relative and general price changes Often inflation makes it difficult for economic agents to immediately distinguish increases in the price of a good which are due to relative price changes from changes in the price which are due to inflation of prices in general. This situation can lead to allocative inefficiency, and is one of the negative effects of inflation.

A PTF normally follows an APAR (Authorized Program Analysis Report a formal report from IBM development to customers that have notified IBM of a problem or suspected defect.), and where an \\"APAR fix\\" was issued, the PTF \\"is a tested APAR\\" or set of APAR fixes. However, if an APAR is resolved as \\"Fixed If Next\\" or \\"Permanent Restriction\\" then there may be no PTF fixing it, only a subsequent release. PTF usage PTFs used to be distributed in a group on a so-called Program Update Tape (PUT) or Recommended Service Upgrade (RSU), approximately on a monthly basis. They can now be downloaded straight to the system through a direct connection to IBM support. In some instances IBM will release a \\"Cumulative PTF Pack\\", a large number of fixes which function best as a whole, and are sometimes codependent. When this happens, IBM issues compact discs containing the entire PTF pack, which can be loaded directly onto the system from its media drive. One reason for the use of physical media is size, and related (default) size limits. \\"By default, the /home file system on VIOS (Virtual I/O Server) for System p is only 10GB in size.\\" If the \\"Cumulative PTF Pack\\" is larger than the default, \\"If you try (to) FTP 17GB of ISO images you will run out of space.\\" The PTFs are processed using SMP/E (System Modification Program/Extended) in several stages over a course of weeks. # Receive (load) the proper PTF to the HA (non-production) system # Apply Check to make sure necessary prequisite PTFs are installed, or are being installed, and that none have been marked \\"held\\" for errors or other problems # Apply the PTF to the HA system, and review the system's performance over multiple weeks to ensure it does not hinder your productivity or functionality # Receive and apply the PTF to the production system and monitor its effects for several weeks If the system is adversely affected by the PTF, a system administrator may sometimes reject (un-apply) the PTF and seek further support from IBM. However, if no problems are found after the PTF is applied, it can be permanently installed, accepted, or committed, to the system. These repairs to IBM software are often in response to APARs submitted by customers and others and acted on by IBM, and are a common first step to resolving software errors. It is generally expected by the customer that the problem would be fully corrected in the next release (version) of the relevant product. Comparison to APAR At times\\"Issues with Cognos and other IBM software can arise from configuration errors, problems in third-party hardware or software, and occasionally, because of a bug in the IBM product itself.\\" IBM software has a bug. Once IBM has ascertained that the cause is not one of * third-party hardware * non-IBM software -or- * user-specified configuration errors, IBM support staff, if they suspect that a defect in a current release of an IBM program is the cause, will file a formal report confirming the existence of an issue. This is referred to as an Authorized Program Analysis Report (APAR). See APARs also include * information on known workarounds * information on whether a formal fix is scheduled to be included in future releases, and *whether or not a Program Temporary Fix (PTF) is planned. Summary There are at least 2 levels of fix:\\"An APAR fix is usually replaced later by a permanent correction called a PTF.\\" * The APAR may result in an \\"APAR fix.\\" * a permanent correction called a PTF.

However, because the feminine pronoun in the Latin sentences is often omitted and the verb form is not inflected for gender, the phrase could be translated with equal validity as \\"[one] flies with [one's] own wings\\", \\"[he] flies with [his] own wings\\", or \\"[it] flies with [its] own wings\\". If macrons are used to indicate the long vowels (standard practice in Latin dictionaries and textbooks), then the phrase becomes ƒÄlƒ´s volat propriƒ´s. The motto was written in English by the judge Jesse Quinn Thornton, and its Latin translation was added to the Territorial Seal adopted by the Oregon Territorial Legislature in 1854.State Symbols: Flag to Motto, Oregon Blue Book The motto referred to the May 2, 1843, vote by Oregon Country settlers at the third Champoeg Meeting to form a provisional government independent of the United States and Great Britain.

Barber was published by the University of California Press in 1984 and republished in a twentieth anniversary edition in 2004. A classic of democratic theory, the book argues that representative or \\"thin\\" democracy is rooted in an individualistic \\"rights\\" perspective that diminishes the role of citizens in democratic governance. The work offers a theoretical critique of representative or liberal democracy and a foundation for participatory politics. The final chapter elucidates practical ways to apply the theory of strong democracy in large industrial societies. Strong democracy is also discussed in The Local Politics of Global Sustainability by Herman Daly, Thomas Prugh and Robert Costanza (2000), and is defined as \\"Politics understood as the creation of a vision that can respond to and change with the changing world.\\"The Local Politics of Global Sustainability by Herman Daly, Thomas Prugh and Robert Costanza (2000), p. 11 The authors go on to describe strong democracy thus: :In a strong democracy, people ‚Äìcitizens ‚Äì govern themselves to the greatest extent possible rather than delegate their power and responsibility to representatives acting in their names. Strong democracy does not mean politics as a way of life, as an all-consuming job, game, and avocation, as it is for so many professional politicians. But it does mean politics (citizenship) as a way of living: an expected element of one‚Äôs life. It is a prominent and natural role, such as that of ‚Äúparent‚Äù or ‚Äúneighbor‚Äù.The Local Politics of Global Sustainability by Herman Daly, Thomas Prugh and Robert Costanza (2000), p. 112 Background Advocates for strengthening democratic institutions and practices in the United States were convened beginning in 2008 under the title of Strengthening Our Nation‚Äôs Democracy (SOND).Stuart Comstock-Gay and Joe Goldman. \\"More than the Vote\\" in the American Prospect.

As a result of the convenings, the groups formed a coalition called the Campaign for Stronger Democracy. Critique of Liberal \\"Thin\\" Democracy \\"Liberal,\\"\\"Thin,\\" or \\"Representative\\" democracy was criticized throughout the 19th century by leading anarchists, such as Proudhon, Bakunin, and Kropotkin. In fact, Kropotkin's essay \\"Representative Government\\" in Words of a Rebel, 1885, can be regarded as a locus classicus of such criticism. Instead of a bottom-up democracy, with a direct democracy or local elections for only local offices, liberal democracy consists of huge masses of people voting for political offices. Winning a mass election is normally a function of how much money is used for advertisement, and, thus, results in a rule by oligarchs, or plutocracy, Barber posits that the radical individualism that underpins liberal theory and practice actually fundamentally undermines democracy. This weak democracy produces less legitimate outcomes than under a stronger democratic structure. Barber also criticizes the liberal construction of the social contract, claiming that traditionalists influenced primarily by Hobbes view man and law as mere abstractions, which contributes to isolationism within society and a series of emergent pathologies. =Dispositions of Liberal Democracy= Barber dissects liberalism into three main dispositions, each representing a certain posture towards conflict and the relationship between the individual and the state.

Licensed to Smiths Falls, Ontario, the station serves the Ottawa market broadcasting at 92.3 FM, with an adult hits format branded as Jack 92.3. CJET has studios located in Smiths Falls (as part of its license agreement), with auxiliary studios located with the Rogers Ottawa cluster at Thurston Drive and Conroy Road in Ottawa, while its transmitter is located near Carleton Place. History The station was launched in 1955 by Rideau Broadcasting, at 1070 AM, and played a country music format. It began broadcasting in a daytime-only capacity On October 22, 1955. In 1958, the station's frequency changed to 630 AM. In 1969, CJET-FM was also launched as a stereo simulcast of the AM signal. That station now uses the callsign CKBY. In 1984, the AM and FM stations were sold to Harvey Glatt's CHEZ-FM Inc., which was subsequently acquired by Rogers Communications, the stations' current owner, in 1999. Rogers converted CJET to FM the following year at 92.3 MHz as Country 92, and the station adopted an adult hits format with the Jack FM branding in 2004. In September 2015, the station changed its format to variety hits but kept the JACK-FM branding. The station's format will feature hits from the late 1960s through today.

It is located north-north-west of downtown Erbil. History Ankawa was originally called Beth Amka, which later morphed to Amku-Bad, Ankawa, and finally Ankawa. The name of the town is mentioned in Bar Hebraeus's book entitled \\"A Brief History of the Countries,\\" where he states: \\"Mongolian troops attacked the area of Erbil on Sunday July 1285 and reached some villages.....including Ankawa.\\" The shrine of Mary also known as Mariamana was built after the ancient Roman designs. Ankawa has many archaeological sites, including \\"The Hill,\\" which was recorded as an archaeological site in Iraq in 1945. It is also home to St Joseph's Cathedral (Umra d'Mar Yosip), the seat of the Chaldean Catholic archbishop of Erbil.Richard Spencer, Iraq crisis: The streets of Erbil‚Äôs newly Christian suburb are now full of helpless people, The Daily Telegraph, August 08, 2014 Ankawa used to be a small village that is located northwest of Erbil, but has grown into a city in its own right. The city has recently become a principal settlement for Christians in Iraq. One of the main reasons for the town's rise is due to 2014 ISIS takeover of the Nineveh Plans, because a fair amount of those who fled came to Ankawa. The Assyrian Church of the East, which after several decades of being located in the United States, has decided to move their Patriarchal see to Ankawa. Ankawa Akkad Sports Club It was 1992 during spring time when a group of young/older athletes with the help of sport experts, started the action of constructing a sports club in Ankawa. Many meetings occurred until 11/06/1992 when the first sport's gathering was at one of the churches in Ankawa which was Mar Gorges. Allegations of tax discrimination The Assyrian Policy Institute (API) has accused the ruling Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) of business and tax discrimination on the Assyrian residents of Ankawa on numerous occasions. One 2018 API report claimed that the KRG required all business owners from the city to renew their business licenses with the Erbil Center District for a fee. The alleged regulation applied exclusively to Ankawa, despite the fact that nine other districts were under the Erbil Center District‚Äôs jurisdiction. There were also allegations that the renewal process was deliberately lengthy and expensive, and that KRG officials expected bribes in exchange for processing the renewals. Many Assyrians viewed this as an attempt by the KRG to hurt their businesses and secure a monopoly on industries in their areas of control. The KRG released an official statement in which they denied these allegations and referred to them as ‚Äúbaseless.‚Äù The API responded to the KRG's denial of these claims in a later report. The API claimed that this latest denial of human rights abuses by the KRG is consistent with previous denial of accusations of wrongdoing. Examples of this that the API provided was the KRG's denial of accusations made by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the US Department of State Human Rights Report. The report goes on to say that the reason that the API had originally made the claim about the KRG tax policy was due to an Ankawa-based activist group called Hand in Hand approaching them and explaining the situation to them. The report also provided documentation of the ordinance in question that proved that a new tax policy specifically in Ankawa had been created by the KRG. The report then says that Assyrian business-owners affected by the new tax policy as well as Assyrian parliamentarians in the Iraqi Parliament and the Kurdistan Region Parliament who corroborated these claims. Some business- owners attempted to legally appeal the policy, but the government upheld the its decision. Furthermore, the report claimed that the Assyrian parliamentarians who were interviewed about the new tax policy claimed that they had inquired to the KRG Shura Council about the policy, and received a response saying: The API claimed that this was essentially a public admission by the KRG that the tax collection policy was arbitrary. The report concluded that the tax rate was imposed on the city of Ankawa as an act of business discrimination against one of the only Assyrian-majority areas in KRG jurisdiction. They encouraged the KRG to formally accept their role in this policy, and claimed that they, ‚Äú[stand] ready to meet with KRG officials both in Iraq and in the United States to address the many long-standing grievances of Ankawa residents, including the improper confiscation of lands belonging to Assyrians and KRG policies advancing demographic change in the area, as well as interference in local, regional, and federal elections for Assyrian representatives.‚Äù Today Within the last 10 years Ankawa has developed rapidly educationally and technologically. Now, many tourists visit Ankawa from Baghdad, mostly from the southern cities. The suburb has been through a long construction period, there are international schools as well as restaurants available today inside. After the fall of Mosul, many Christians who had been displaced came to Ankawa and have been provided with personal needs by the church and international organizations. Demographically, the area mostly consists of ethnic Assyrians, most of whom adhere to the Chaldean Catholic Church.

He held a Distinguished Professorship of Evolution, Population Genetics and Genomics at Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana. Besides over 250 papers, especially in population genetics, he has written a two volume textbook with Bruce Walsh, widely considered the \\"Bible\\" of quantitative genetics. Alongside this textbook he has also published two other books. He has been a major force in promoting neutral theories to explain genomic architecture based on the effects of population sizes in different lineages; he presented this point of view comprehensively in his 2007 book \\"The Origins of Genome Architecture\\". In 2009, he was elected to the National Academy of Sciences (Evolutionary Biology). Lynch was a Biology undergraduate at St. Bonaventure University and received a B.S. in Biology in 1973. He obtained his PhD from the University of Minnesota (Ecology and Behavioral Biology) in 1977.  Research  = Evolution of genome architecture = Population genetics principles, phylogenetic analyses, rate calculations, and allele frequency spectra of derived SNPs are employed to understand evolutionary mechanisms behind eukaryotic genome complexity. Hypotheses around the ideas that eukaryotic genome complexity evolved as a result of a passive response to reduced population size, deleterious newly arisen introns in species of Daphnia, genomic response to alterations in population size and mutation rates in E. coli and the evolutionary fates of duplicate genes in of species of Paramecium using complete genomic sequencing are investigated. Lynch is working on designing methods that allow for ascertaining the population-genetic features using high-throughput genome sequence data and take into account uncertainties due to low coverage and error-prone sequences. = Role of mutation in evolution = Most mutations are mildly deleterious and can eventually lead to decreased evolutionary fitness in a species. Using the Tree of Life, Lynch investigates the significant variation across diverse invertebrates and simple eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms using a mutation-accumulation strategy. To address this mutation diversity and the load of mutation on survival in some species, a novel method involving a mutation accumulation strategy that is followed by whole genome sequencing allows for estimation of error rates in transcription and variation among eukaryotic lineages. The work done to estimate this variation translates to population genetic theories for mutation rates and how somatic mutations can eventually evolve to multicellularity. These approaches promote the evolutionary ideas of the drift-barrier hypothesis. = Role of recombination in evolution = A major drawback of sexual recombination is the separation of complexes of alleles that have adapted together. Study of Daphnia pulex, a microcrustacean that has the ability to reproduce sexually and asexually based upon which is advantageous at particular evolutionary time points, allows for direct quantification and comparison of recombination rates in mobile genetic elements in sexual and asexual lineages. This species of Daphnia's asexual lineage is rather young in an evolutionary time perspective and rapidly go extinct. It is hypothesized that this rapid extinction is caused by a loss of heterozygosity caused by asexual reproduction as well as gene conversion exposing them to pre-existing deleterious mutations. A new reference genome assembly of this species has recently been generated and attention to the role of recombination in Daphnia has been of hallmark importance to Lynch's research in recent years. = Evolutionary cell biology = Currently, no formal field of evolutionary cell biology exists. The link between the evolution of phenotypes and molecular evolution is found at the level of cellular architecture. Recent work spearheaded by Michael Lynch and his lab seeks to link traditional evolutionary theory with molecular and cellular biology alongside comparative cellular biology observations. Using Paramecium as a model species, studies of the evolutionary basis of: evolution of cellular surveillance mechanisms, barriers as a result of random genetic drift on molecular perfection, multimeric proteins, vesicle transport and gene expression. A majority of this area of Lynch's research is preliminary and the value of this research is yet to be determined, as of 2017, but if fruitful will work to develop a framework for a formal evolutionary cell biology field.

Early life and family She was born Florence Harriet Montgomery in Chelsea, London, on 17 January 1843, the second of the seven surviving children of Admiral Alexander Leslie Montgomery (1807‚Äì1888) and his wife Caroline Rose Campbell (1818‚Äì1909) of Hampton Court, Middlesex. Her father was also an MP. He succeeded to a baronetcy in 1878. He was a cousin of the novelist Baroness von Tautphoeus (1807‚Äì1893). Her cousin, Sibyl Montgomery (died 1935), was the first wife of the Marquess of Queensberry and mother of Lord Alfred Douglas. Florence Montgomery's story- telling abilities were first tried on younger brothers and sisters, but the novelist G. J.

Owned by Bell Media, the station broadcasts Premiere Radio Networks' 24/7 Comedy radio network under the brand \\"Funny 820\\". CHAM's studios are located on Upper Wentworth Street near Lime Ridge Mall in Hamilton, while its 6-tower array is located near Binbrook. Station history CHAM began operations in November 1959 as a 5,000 watt station at the 1280 AM frequency under the CHIQ call letters. Initially the station broadcast a classical music format but rock and roll was featured later in the 1960s, with Canadian radio personality David Marsden among the station's DJ roster. In 1965, the power was increased to 10,000 watts day / 5,000 watts night (the station went full-time 10 kW in 1968). The station was purchased from CHIQ, Ltd. in 1967 by (Ted) Rogers Broadcasting Ltd., which received approval from the CRTC to change the call letters from CHIQ to CHAM. Under Rogers' ownership and management by Dancy Broadcasting, Ltd., CHAM launched a \\"Middle of the road\\" music format on November 1, 1967. By 1970, CHAM switched to Top 40 format, directly competing with CKOC (a future sister station of CHAM's in the 2000s) and including in its playlist many records that didn't receive exposure elsewhere in the market. Some of the personalities who worked at CHAM during this time period included Paul Godfrey, Dick Joseph (who worked there twice - the second time under their next call letters), Gil Harris, Rockin' Ron Baptist, Ravin' Dave Mitchell, Don Collins, Bob Wood (later program/operations manager of WBEN AM/FM in Buffalo), Ike Isaac, Ken Packham, Skip Dewling, Wayne Dion, J.J.Clarke, Don West, Len Robinson, Dave Fisher Ted Michaels, and newscaster Glen Darling. CHAM published a weekly Top 40 poster approximately between 1971 and 1974. In an unusual move, CHAM's broadcasting facilities were located inside a shopping mall called Terminal Towers, from which passers by could peer into the station's glass walls and watch the announcers work. In 1976, CHAM was sold to Keith Dancy and the station adopted a \\"gold and great\\" format under the CJJD call sign. Soon afterward, the station's facilities were moved out of Terminal Towers (and the public eye) and up a few blocks to Lloyd D. Jackson Square. For one year in 1978, the station held the radio broadcast rights to the Hamilton Tiger-Cats football team; between the team's creation in 1950 and 2014, it was the only year in which the Tiger-Cats were not heard on longtime CHML (Tiger-Cats broadcasts, along with all other sports broadcasts in Hamilton, were acquired by TSN Radio 1150 in 2015). In 1981, Moffat Communications, Ltd. acquired CJJD and immediately upgraded the station's facilities, expanded its news staff, and included some talk programming in the lineup. Moffat changed the station call sign back to CHAM in 1982, and in July 1983, changed format to country music, broadcasting in AM stereo. In August 1985, CHAM moved to a stronger frequency at 820 AM, increasing power to 50,000 watts daytime and 10,000 watts at night.Decision CRTC 85-13 As a pioneering country station, \\"820 CHAM\\" would earn its greatest fame and following, having had a good run for 2+ decades under various management and ownership, including Golden West Broadcasting (who acquired the station in 1993), Affinity Radio Group (1997), and Telemedia (2000). CHAM was honoured as Canadian Country Music Association Station of the Year in 1989, the same year the Country Music Association bestowed Medium Market Station honours. In 2002, Standard Broadcasting acquired CHAM and its sister stations (CKOC and CKLH), and on January 31, 2005, at 8:20am, with contemporary country listeners having gravitated to the FM dial, adjusted CHAM's format to become \\"All Time Country Favourites: 820 CHAM - The Legend,\\" with the station concentrating on classic country music (though a few current songs would later be included on a limited basis). In October 2007, Astral Media acquired Standard Broadcasting's terrestrial radio and television assets, including CHAM. On August 29, 2008, the station began stunting with all-Christmas music, teasing listeners that on September 2, 2008, there would be \\"ten thousand reasons to tune in at 8:20am.\\" On September 2, CHAM's new format was revealed ‚Äî a news/talk radio format as \\"Talk 820.\\" CHAM's talk schedule would include local talk shows hosted by Mike Nabuurs, Becky Coles, Jason Farr, Jodi Gaskell, Dave Shuttleworth, and Mike Bullard, along with syndicated shows including Dennis Miller. The new CHAM format included live sports coverage, including Hamilton Bulldogs hockey, Toronto Blue Jays baseball, and National Football League broadcasts from Westwood One. The \\"Talk 820\\" format of CHAM did not provide the total numbers that Astral was looking for, with the station lagging behind longtime Hamilton talk stalwart CHML. Seeing an opportunity to fill a country void in the Hamilton market left by CING-FM's changeover to classic hits in 2009, and taking advantage of a staff restructuring at the Astral Hamilton station cluster, CHAM reverted to an all- country format (and the \\"820 CHAM\\" branding) on July 22, 2010 at Noon. The playlist concentrated on both current country and hits from the past 20 years, with a greater than usual focus on Canadian content. The station would keep many of the sports commitments it adopted during its talk format, many of which it had already held prior to the talk format's debut.\\"CHAM swings back to country format; three hosts lose jobs\\" , from Hamilton Spectator, 7/22/2010 By August 2011, CHAM gained country competition when CHKX-FM flipped formats from smooth jazz to country. CHKX and its clearer-sounding FM signal would eventually surpass CHAM in the ratings,\\"No kidding: Hamilton radio station CHAM goes all comedy,\\" from The Hamilton Spectator, 8/20/2012 leading to speculation that CHAM would drop country a second time. On August 20, 2012, Astral Media would confirm that CHAM would change to an all-comedy format; at 8:20 a.m. the next morning (August 21, 2012), after playing \\"Here Comes Goodbye\\" by Rascal Flatts and \\"Sideways\\" by Dierks Bentley, the station became \\"Funny 820,\\" Astral's second full-time comedy station (after London's CKSL). The content on \\"Funny 820\\" relies heavily on vintage and archived stand-up and improvisational comedy bits provided by 24/7 Comedy Radio, a US-based service to which Astral owns exclusive Canadian broadcast rights.\\"Hamilton, Ontario Gets Funny,\\" from RadioInsight, 8/20/2012 Local content is currently limited to voiceovers and traffic and entertainment updates provided by Mike Nabuurs, the \\"Funny 820 Ambassador of Funny\\" and the only on-air talent carried over from \\"820 CHAM,\\" although spotlights on local comedy talent have not been ruled out in the future. In early 2013, the station added Astral's new late night Humble & Fred show.\\"Humble And Fred Return To Radio Via Astral Media, CFRB\\". Mediabase, January 14, 2013. Most recently, for the 2013-2014 hockey season, the station is airing Toronto Maple Leafs games in addition to their usual comedic fare. 24/7 Comedy ceased terrestrial distribution in August 2014. The station has continued to air stand-up comedy since the closure, one of only two remaining stations in Canada to carry the format. It remains the second least-listened-to station in the market, with, in the latest report from Numeris in fall 2018, 15,400 listeners (a 0.7% market share), ahead of only TSN Radio 1150.https://www.thepublicrecord.ca/2016/06/numeris-rations- for-hamilton-radio-show-tsn-1150-tanking-other-stations-down-too/ Logos { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"2\\" cellspacing=\\"1\\" style=\\"border:1px solid #aaa\\" - align=center !height=\\"150px\\" bgcolor=\\"#F9F9F9\\"  120px !height=\\"150px\\" bgcolor=\\"#F9F9F9\\"  120px !height=\\"150px\\" bgcolor=\\"#F9F9F9\\"  120px - !width=\\"150px\\" colspan=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  2005-2008 !width=\\"150px\\" colspan=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  2008‚Äì2010 !width=\\"150px\\" colspan=\\"1\\" bgcolor=\\"#CCCCCC\\"  2010‚Äì2012 } References External links * The official \\"Funny 820\\" website  Ham Ham Category:Radio stations established in 1959 Ham Category:1959 establishments in Ontario Category:Comedy radio stations in Canada ","title":"CHAM (radio station)"},{"id":"3651431","text":"Ahmed Abdou (born 1936) is a Comorian politician.

A dive log is a record of the diving history of an underwater diver. The log may either be in a book, locally hosted software, or web based. The log serves purposes both related to safety and personal records. Information in a log may contain the date, time and location, the profile of the dive, equipment used, air usage, above and below water conditions, including temperature, current, wind and waves, general comments, and verification by the buddy, instructor or supervisor. In case of a diving accident, it can provide valuable data regarding diver's previous experience, as well as the other factors that might have led to the accident itself. Recreational divers are generally advised to keep a logbook as a record, while professional divers may be legally obliged to maintain a logbook which is up to date and complete in its records. The professional diver's logbook is a legal document and may be important for getting employment. The required content and formatting of the professional diver's logbook is generally specified by the registration authority, but may also be specified by an industry association such as the International Marine Contractors Association (IMCA). Contents of the logbook Typical fields in a recreational diver's log book would be the following: *Header - Contains basic information about the date, time and location of the dive. *Profile - Records sufficient detail to show the profile of the dive. *Equipment - Shows what the diver was wearing and what dive gear was used during the dive. *Conditions - Allows the diver to record what the environment was like (both above and below water). *Comments - Used for any general information not covered in other sections. *Verification - used to record the signature and certification details of the buddy / instructor that was with the diver during the dive. A more minimalistic log book for recreational divers who are only interested in keeping a record of their accumulated experience (total number of dives and total amount of time underwater), could just contain the first point of the above list and the maximum depth of the dive.

Nicknamed the \\"Highlanders,\\" their primary weapon system is the LAV-25 Light Armored Vehicle armed with the M242 25mm Bushmaster chain gun. They fall under the command of the 1st Marine Division and the I Marine Expeditionary Force. The unit is based out of the Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton, California. Organization An LAV platoon consists of 4 vehicles usually divided into Alpha section and Bravo section. The platoon commander will control one section and also be the vehicle commander (VC) of one of the LAVs and the platoon sergeant will control the other section as well as be VC. A crew consists of a driver, usually the most junior 0313 (the MOS designation for LAV Crewman), a VC and the gunner. The gunner operates the main gun, the M242 Bushmaster chaingun. The VC makes target acquisition changes and helps the gunner make adjustments. The remaining crew consists of Scouts (0311). The LAV can hold as many as 6 scouts, but in most cases there are only 3‚Äì4 in the back. There is also 1 corpsman per platoon, and 1 Light Armored Vehicle Mechanic (2147, the MOS designation for the LAV Mechanic). History =Early years= 1st Light Armored Vehicle Battalion was activated in May 1985 and began receiving the first of its LAV-25 light armored vehicles in July 1985. On 9 October 1988, the battalion's name was changed to 1st Light Armored Infantry Battalion. = Persian Gulf War & the 1990s = In August 1990, First Light Armored Infantry Battalion deployed to Southwest Asia in response to Iraq‚Äôs invasion of Kuwait. During Operation Desert Shield, 1st Light Armored Infantry Battalion was the forward unit of the 1st Marine Division, conducting screening and counter-reconnaissance operations along the Kuwaiti-Saudi Arabian border. During Operation Desert Storm, after breaching the Iraqi defensive positions, 1st Light Armored Infantry Battalion attacked north to locate and destroy enemy forces. On the third day of the ground offensive, 1st Light Armored Infantry Battalion was the first of the Allied Forces to enter Kuwait City, capturing Kuwait International Airport on 28 February 1991. The battalion redeployed to the United States in April 1991. On May 1, 1992, 1st Light Armored Infantry Battalion deployed to Los Angeles on a four-hour notice and assisted the Long Beach Police Department in quelling civil disturbances and looting. After a successful deployment as part of the Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force Los Angeles, the battalion returned once again to Camp Pendleton. On June 12, 1992, 1st Light Armored Infantry Battalion was redesignated as First Reconnaissance Battalion (Light Armored). Almost two years later, on March 1, 1994, 1st Reconnaissance Battalion (Light Armored) underwent another name change and was redesignated First Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion. =Global War on Terror= A 1st LAR LAV-25 In December 2001, Bravo Company, 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion deployed to Afghanistan as part of the 15th Marine Expeditionary Unit (Special Operations Capable) in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. It performed a variety of combat/reconnaissance missions in the rugged terrain of Afghanistan. In January 2003, it was deployed to Southwest Asia in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. The battalion, operating as part of Regimental Combat Team Five, was the first unit to cross the Iraqi-Kuwaiti Border on March 20, 2003. After attacking northward through Iraq, 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion was instrumental in securing the capital of Baghdad. Due to its unique mobility and reconnaissance capabilities, the battalion left Regimental Combat Team Five and was assigned to Task Force Tripoli. As part of Task Force Tripoli, the battalion advanced further north, ultimately securing former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein‚Äôs hometown of Tikrit. Following the cessation of major combat operations, First Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion moved from the northern portion of Iraq to the country's extreme southern area along the Saudi-Arabian border to halt and deter illegal smuggling into Iraq. First Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion redeployed to the United States at the end of May 2003. In February 2004 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance Battalion (-) again returned to Iraq. The battalion conducted security and stability operations in the Al Anbar province of western Iraq as part of Regimental Combat Team Seven. 1st LAR performed a wide range of critical missions, including key roles in regimental size operations, in order to capture or kill terrorist and insurgent forces. Additionally, the battalion was vital in patrolling the western borders of Iraq in order to prevent the infiltration of arms and insurgents from Ar Rutba in the south to Al Qaim further north. The battalion returned to the United States in October 2004. In July 2004, Charlie Company deployed with the 31st MEU in support of Operation Phantom Fury, Fallujah, Iraq. In March 2007, parts of the battalion were responsible for security and stabilization in the area around Ar Rutba in western Iraq. In September 2008, 1st LAR deployed again to the Al Anbar Province in western Iraq and conducted a Relief In Place (RIP) with 2nd LAR of Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. 1st LAR conducted security and stabilization operations around Camp Korean Village and Ar Rutba before turning over the battlespace to 2nd Battalion, 25th Marines. 1st LAR then moved north to Sinjar Airfield, just west of Mosul, to conduct more security and stabilization operations. With them, they had elements of 1st Tanks, 2d tanks, A/1/2, 1st Reconnaissance Battalion, a Tow Missile Platoon and Army and Navy support personnel. In April 2009 1st LAR conducted a RIP with 3d LAR and redeployed to Camp Pendleton, CA. (Note, Fox Company, 4th LAR was attached to 1st LAR for the duration of this deployment) 6 mach 2009, A LAV-M with Fox Company, 1st Light Armored Reconnaissance, Regimental Combat Team 8, fires an 81mm high explosive mortar at a range here. This is the first time that mortarmen with Company F have been able to focus their primary skills due to their deployment mission of monitoring the Syrian border. In May 2010, 1st LAR deployed to Reg-E-Khan Neshin district (Rig District) in southern Helmand Province, Afghanistan. While there, 1st LAR Bn remained the southernmost unit attached to the MEF. Operating out of Combat Out Post (COP) Payne as the Battalion CP, the unit controlled a swath of 750 square kilometers in southern Helmand Province. Operations out of COP Khan Neshin Castle, Patrol Base (PB) Shabu and COP Taghaz were conducted by Alpha Company (Arthur Co). PB South Station controlled Sar Banadar and terrain south of the river along the fertile terrain, and was manned by Charlie Company (Celtic Co). The vastly unpopulated trafficking area to the south was controlled by Bravo Company (Beserker Co). Concurrently, Echo Company (Enormous Co), separated from the rest of the battalion, relying on British and Danish support, operated near Gereshk in central Helmand province and took part in hundreds of engagements and IED strikes in an attempt to control the only highway through Afghanistan at the time. Joint missions were conducted to close the gap between 3/1 and 1st LAR in October 2010. A substantial raid was conducted on Baghram Cha, a border town and chief logistical hub for Taliban activity in late October 2010, named Operation Steel Dawn. During the raid, 1st LAR, special operations forces and Afghan forces neutralized Bahram Chah and destroyed the Bazaar and Taliban stronghold. 1st LAR conducted a RIP with 3rd LAR in November 2010. 1st LAR deployed again to Rig District in September 2011 and returned in May 2012. Equipment The LAV-25 is an all-terrain, all-weather vehicle with night capabilities. It is air transportable via C-130, C-17 Globemaster, and C-5 Galaxy.

For many years, Hamilton Tiger-Cats and McMaster Marauders Canadian football games were heard on CHML, as were the Hamilton Bulldogs; the relationship between CHML and the Tiger-Cats was particularly long, as CHML had been the flagship station for the team from the year of merger of the Tigers and Wildcats in 1950 until 2014. By 2016, CHML had lost all of its sports rights to CKOC. CHML continues to air its long-running Tiger-Cats postgame show, The 5th Quarter, as an unofficial production; it also joined the Buffalo Bills Radio Network in 2016. right CHML airs old time radio programs from the 1940s and 1950s nightly, as well as weekends. These shows feature classic NBC and CBS programs. National news is provided by the Canadian Press's radio service. Previously CHML has carried American syndicated programming such as Coast to Coast AM, Dr. Joy Browne and The Jim Rome Show. Coverage area At night, CHML is heard across much of eastern Canada and America's Mid-Atlantic and New England regions. It has a 50,000 watt signal, the strongest on that frequency in all of Canada or the United States, with an unusual starburst directional pattern but, because it lies within a regional frequency according to NARBA and must protect several local stations that use the frequency in the United States, is not a clear-channel station. (CHML does have de facto clear-channel status in eastern Canada, as no other stations east of Saskatchewan use the frequency.)

It was located in the territory of present-day Central Serbia, Serbia. Administration =Eyalet belonging= The sanjak belonged to Rumelia Eyalet between 1459 and 1541, and again between 1716 and 1717 and again 1739 and 1817 (nominally to 1830), to Budin Eyalet between 1541 and 1686, and to Teme»ôvar Eyalet between 1686 and 1688 and again between 1690 and 1716. =Borders= During the governorship of Hadji Mustafa Pasha (1793‚Äì1801), the administration was expanded eastwards to include the Kladovo area, until then part of the Sanjak of Vidin. History =15th century= The Sanjak of Smederevo was formed after the fall of the Serbian Despotate in 1459, and its administrative seat was Smederevo. Ottoman sources note a migration of \\"Vlachs\\" (pastoralists) to the Sanjak of Smederevo and parts of the Sanjak of Kru≈°evac and Sanjak of Vidin; in 1476 there were 7,600 Vlach households and 15,000 peasant households. In the 1470s, because of the fighting with the Hungarians many areas in northern Serbia were deserted. Ottomans start colonize that area with Vlachs as a military element, and this colonization includes entire territory of the Sanjak of Smederevo, most of Sanjak of Kru≈°evac and Vidin. Vlachs to that area coming from northern Herzegovina, which includes parts of today's Montenegro and from Stari Vlah (ƒ∞stari Eflak) region in the southwestern Serbia.Vjeran Kursar; (2013) Being an Ottoman Vlach: On Vlach Identity (Ies), Role and Status in Western Parts of the Ottoman Balkans (15th-18th Centuries) p. 130; Journal of the Center for Ottoman Studies - Ankara University, 24, 34; 115-161 =16th century= After the Ottoman Empire conquered Belgrade in 1521, the administrative seat of the Sanjak was moved to this city. In this period when the Battle of Moh√°cs took place the sanjakbey of Smederevo was Kuƒçuk Bali-beg. Ottoman campaigns against Hungary in 16th century reduced part of the population which migrated to the Hungarian territory, according to tax registrations from 1476 and 1516 about 17% villages were abandoned. Ottoman resettle abandoned lands with populations from neighboring district which were mostly semi-nomadic Vlach groups from area of Bosnia, Hercegovina, Montenegro, and Stari Vlah in Serbia. Vlachs made up 15% of the population in Smederevo in 1516.Nikolay Antov, 2013, The Ottoman State and Semi-Nomadic Groups Along The Ottoman Danubian Serhad (Frontier Zone) In The Late 15 th and The First Half of The 16 th Centuries: Challenges and Policies http://real.mtak.hu/38980/1/hstud.27.2013.2.2.pdf #page=224,226 =18th century= The Sanjak was occupied by the Habsburg Monarchy as the Kingdom of Serbia (1718‚Äì39), however, with the Treaty of Belgrade, the area was ceded to the Ottoman Empire. Belgrade, the center of the region while under Austrian rule, was neglected under the Ottomans and Smederevo (Semendire) was the administrative center. Nevertheless, Belgrade eventually became the seat of a pasha with the title of vizier and the Sanjak began to be referred to as the Pashaluk of Belgrade, although it was still called the Sanjak of Smederevo in official documents. In 1788, Koƒça's frontier rebellion saw eastern ≈†umadija occupied by Austrian Serbian freikorps and hajduks. From 1788‚Äì91, Belgrade was again under Austrian rule after Koƒça's rebellion. The Siege of Belgrade from 15 September to 8 October 1789, a Habsburg Austrian force besieged the fortress of Belgrade. The Austrians held the city until 1791 when it handed Belgrade back to the Ottomans according to the terms of the Treaty of Sistova. In 1793 and 1796 Sultan Selim III proclaimed firmans which gave more rights to Serbs. Among other things, taxes were to be collected by the obor-knez (dukes); freedom of trade and religion were granted and there was peace. Selim III also decreed that some unpopular janissaries were to leave the Belgrade Pashaluk as he saw them as a threat to the central authority of Hadji Mustafa Pasha. Many of those janissaries were employed by or found refuge with Osman Pazvantoƒülu, a renegade opponent of Sultan Selim III in the Sanjak of Vidin. Fearing the dissolution of the Janissary command in the Sanjak of Smederevo, Osman Pazvantoƒülu launched a series of raids against Serbians without the permission of Sultan Selim III, causing much volatility and fear in the region. Pazvantoƒülu was defeated in 1793 by the Serbs at the Battle of Kolari. In the summer of 1797 the sultan appointed Mustafa Pasha on position of beglerbeg of Rumelia Eyalet and he left Serbia for Plovdiv to fight against the Vidin rebels of Pazvantoƒülu. During the absence of Mustafa Pasha, the forces of Pazvantoƒülu captured Po≈æarevac and besieged the Belgrade fortress. At the end of November 1797 obor-knezes Aleksa Nenadoviƒá, Ilija Birƒçanin and Nikola Grboviƒá from Valjevo brought their forces to Belgrade and forced the besieging janissary forces to retreat to Smederevo. By 1799 the janissary corps had returned, as they were pardoned by Sultan's decree, and they immediately suspended the Serbian autonomy and drastically increased taxes, enforcing martial law in Serbia. On 15 December 1801, the popular Vizier of Belgrade Hadji Mustafa Pasha, a trusted ally of Selim III, was murdered by Kuƒçuk Alija. Alija was one of the four leading Dahijas, Janissary commanders who were opposed to the Sultan's reforms. This resulted in the Sanjak of Smederevo being ruled by these renegade janissaries independently from the Ottoman government. Several district chiefs were murdered in the Slaughter of the Knezes on February 4, 1804, by the renegade janissaries. This sparked the First Serbian Uprising (1804‚Äì13), the first phase of the Serbian Revolution. Despite suppression of the uprising in 1813 and Had≈æi Prodan's Revolt in 1814, the Second Serbian Uprising led by Duke Milo≈° Obrenoviƒá succeeded with creation of semi-independent Principality of Serbia in 1817 (confirmed with Ferman from Mahmud II in 1830), gained independence in 1878 by Treaty of San Stefano and evolved to Kingdom of Serbia in 1882. This marked the end of the Sanjak. Demographics The majority of Slavic-speaking Muslims (called \\"Serb-Muslims\\" in historiography) in the Belgrade Pashalik were immigrants. These were mostly villagers, but also feudals, soldiers, officials, and some were among the highest social class, in the administration. The proportion of Muslims was notably decreased in the late 17th and first half of the 18th century, after a major influx of Serbs (Christians) from outlying territories, mostly from Dinaric areas.

The station airs a Sports Radio format branded as TSN Radio and is owned by Bell Media. CKOC is a 50,000 watt, Class B station operating on a Regional (not clear-channel) broadcast frequency, with transmitters located near Empire Corners in Haldimand County, about 25 kilometers (15 miles) south of Hamilton. A six-tower directional antenna is used at all times. CKOC's studios are located on Upper Wentworth Street (next to Lime Ridge Mall) in Hamilton.  History  = Early history = CKOC has the distinction of being the oldest continuously-operating radio station in Canada, on the air since May 1, 1922. Station CHAB, in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, began broadcasting a week earlier, on April 23, 1922, and is still on the air today, but was shut down for a period of time in 1933 before re-opening. As well, CFCF, later CINW, Montreal, had traced its sign on to 1919, but ceased operations in 2010. Originally, CKOC's station was based in the Lower City at the corner of King William and John Streets, and was an offshoot of the Wentworth Radio and Supply Company. In the spring of 1922, the station became the third radio station in all of Canada. Other broadcast locations over the years for CKOC include, the 11th floor of the Royal Connaught Hotel in the downtown core, the Lister Block building on James & King Williams Streets, and a studio on Garfield Avenue near King & Sherman Avenue North. During its early years, the station broadcast on a number of frequencies, including 880, 630 and 1120 kHz; the station moved to its current frequency of 1150 in 1941. CKOC became a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation affiliate in 1936 and would be an affiliate of the CBC's Trans-Canada Network until 1962. =Later History: CHR and Oldies formats= CKOC featured a Top 40/CHR hitmusic format from 1960 to 1992, and increased its power to 50,000 watts in 1979. On February 17, 1992, after a countdown of the Top 500 hits of all time (a long-running annual tradition at the station), CKOC debuted \\"Oldies 1150\\" with the new calls CKMO (\\"More Oldies\\"). CKOC flips from Top 40 to Oldies However, on April 2, 1993, the station reverted to the heritage CKOC calls, admitting that dropping the calls in the first place had been a mistake and that the station's listeners wanted the original calls back. The station mentioned its Top 40 heritage on the air as part of the current oldies format, with liners such as, \\"The station that played 'em then... plays 'em again.\\" The \\"Good Times, Great Oldies\\" branding started sometime in late 2006. From 1928 to 1955, the call letters CKMO were used at a pioneer radio station in Vancouver. From 1993 to 2012, the CKMO call sign was again used at a radio station in Victoria, British Columbia. In 2014, the CKMO call letters moved to a radio station in Orangeville as CKMO-FM. CKOC first applied for an FM station in 1968, but the FM station did not take to the air until 1986 as adult contemporary station CKLH-FM. CKOC has suffered from much co-channel interference from CJRC in Gatineau, Quebec at night, particularly in Southwestern Ontario and north of Toronto which received a relatively clear signal for CKOC during the day. In these areas, CKOC was almost impossible to pick up on some nights due to CJRC. This interference was remedied in Spring 2007, when CJRC moved to the FM dial and closed the AM signal. On October 28, 2007, CKOC was purchased by Astral Media as part of its purchase of Standard Broadcasting. 140px In 2012, CKOC, known as one of \\"Canada's Oldest radio stations\\", turned 90 years old.CKOC Oldies 1150-AM ‚Äì Canada‚Äôs Oldest Radio Station Turns 90, The Canadian Business JournalPaul Wilson: Canada's oldest radio still rockin', CBC News, May 15, 2012Classic Hits CKOC 1150 ‚Äì CKOC 90th Birthday In mid-June 2013, after Vinyl 95.3 switched formats from Classic Hits to hot AC, CKOC added more 1970s' and 1980s' music to its playlist. It was the first time since February 1992, when the station changed its format, that any music later than the 1970s has been played on the station, a trend mirroring most other oldies outlets in North America, which have moved away from the oldies positioning and have adopted classic hits approaches. The station dropped the \\"Great Oldies\\" reference and referred to itself as \\"Classic Hits 1150 CKOC\\". On June 27, 2013, Astral Media was absorbed by Bell Media, making CKOC a Bell owned-and-operated station. On November 4, 2014, the CRTC approved an application by Bell Media to modify CKOC's facilities from a five-tower day pattern and a ten-tower night pattern with a transmitter power of 50,000 watts to a six-tower operation with a daytime transmitter power of 50,000 watts and a night-time transmitter power of 20,000 watts.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2014-565, CKOC Hamilton - Technical change, CRTC, November 4, 2014 =TSN 1150= On May 28, 2015, Bell Media announced that CKOC would flip to sports talk later that fall, joining the TSN Radio network as \\"TSN Radio 1150\\". As part of a new agreement, the station became the home station for the CFL's Hamilton Tiger-Cats, and the Hamilton affiliate for the Toronto Raptors and Toronto Maple Leafs; the station also later acquired the rights to McMaster Marauders football. This move also made the station Hamilton's first-ever all-sports station. TSN Radio Coming To Hamilton On September 2, CKOC announced they will flip to the format on Labour Day, September 7, in conjunction with the Tiger-Cats vs. Argonauts Labour Day Classic. CKOC ended its classic hits format with \\"The Last Big 500 Countdown\\" of the top classic hits during the Labour Day weekend before the launch of the sports format at 10 a.m. on September 7. The #1 song in the countdown, and the last song played on CKOC, was \\"Satisfaction\\" by The Rolling Stones.CKOC Flips To TSN Radio CKOC Goes Out Rockin', Adam Atkinson, CHCH-TV, September 3, 2015 CKOC is unusual among Canadian radio stations in that its programming is primarily from American networks: Fox Sports Radio fills out most of the broadcast day, with three local shows; Ticats at Noon, Game Day and Tatti & Marsh; on the daily schedule. The use of Fox Sports Radio for programming is despite the ownership of 20% of TSN by Fox Sports' competitor, ESPN. Initial ratings for TSN Sports radio in Hamilton were extremely poor, as CKOC's market share dropped from 2.9% to 0.3%.https://www.thepublicrecord.ca/2016/06/numeris-rations-for-hamilton- radio-show-tsn-1150-tanking-other-stations-down-too/ With approximately 5,900 listeners a week, CKOC is now the lowest-rated station in the Hamilton market. In 2016, CKOC acquired rights to Hamilton Bulldogs hockey, giving the station an effective monopoly on Hamilton sports play-by-play. On April 3, 2018, CKOC began broadcasting Sunday Night's Main Event. The program primarily covers news and events surrounding professional wrestling (such as WWE) and mixed martial arts. It is hosted by Jason Agnew, former host of Live Audio Wrestling.

He won The Sporting News Rookie Pitcher of the Year Award in 1988 for the National League. He was also the pitching coach for the Cleveland Indians. Career During his 14-year baseball career, Belcher pitched from 1987‚Äì2000 for seven different ballclubs: the Los Angeles Dodgers (1987‚Äì1991), Cincinnati Reds (1992‚Äì1993), Chicago White Sox (1993), Detroit Tigers (1994), Seattle Mariners (1995), Kansas City Royals (1996‚Äì1998), and Anaheim Angels (1999‚Äì2000). Belcher played high school baseball at Highland High School and intercollegiate varsity baseball at Mount Vernon Nazarene College in Mount Vernon, Ohio. He was the first draft pick in the 1983 Major League Baseball Draft, selected by the Minnesota Twins. However, he refused to sign with the Twins, and instead was selected in the 1984 supplemental draft by the New York Yankees. He was picked up by the Oakland Athletics in the compensation pool. After climbing through the A's system to Triple-A, he was traded to Los Angeles on September 3, 1987, as the \\"player to be named later\\" in the Rick Honeycutt transaction. He made his MLB debut on September 6 as a Dodger. Belcher was a member of the 1988 Dodgers team that won the World Series, defeating the Oakland Athletics. Belcher won one game in the World Series after winning twice in the National League Championship Series. In 1989, he led the National League with 10 complete games and tied (with Roger Clemens, of the American League) for the MLB lead in total shutouts with eight, while placing in the top ten in wins and ERA. His 1989 shutout total has not since been equaled in MLB. However, his stay in Los Angeles proved brief, as he was traded to the Reds in 1991 as a part of the Eric Davis multi- player transaction. He tied a career high with 15 wins for the Reds, but was dealt again, this time to the White Sox in the middle of the 1993 season at the trading deadline. He won Game Four of the American League Championship Series in relief against the Toronto Blue Jays. Filing for free agency, he signed with the Tigers for 1994, but led the American League in losses with 15 that strike-shortened year. He returned in 1995 to the Reds on a one-year minor-league contract, but was soon dealt by them a second time, this time in May to the Mariners. New York Yankees superstar shortstop Derek Jeter got his first major league hit off Belcher in the Kingdome on May 30, 1995. At the end of the regular season, Belcher lost two post-season games, the only two playoff losses he suffered in his career; after Game 2 of the 1995 American League Division Series, he raged in the locker room area and assaulted a cameraman for filming him after giving up a game-winning home run to Yankee catcher Jim Leyritz. Again becoming a free agent, he signed with the Royals for the 1996 season, spending the next three years with Kansas City and leading the team in wins each season. On June 5, 1999, Belcher was involved in an on-field brawl at Dodger Stadium. At the time a member of the Anaheim Angels, Belcher was involved in an altercation with then-Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Chan Ho Park. Park claimed that Belcher had tagged him too hard on the just-concluded play and asked him about the incident. Belcher remarked with racist comments causing Park to kick him. Belcher played his final game on September 30, 2000. He retired in spring training in 2001, his effectiveness gone following a series of injuries. On November 6, 2009, Belcher was named pitching coach for the Cleveland Indians after spending eight seasons in the Indians organization as a Special Assistant to Baseball Operations. In September 2015, Belcher resigned his position as pitching coach.

A serious accident almost killed him in 1967. He had been selected to represent Pakistan in squash's first World Team Championship, and was on a train travelling from Quetta to Karachi for the final training camp when he leaned too far out of a railway carriage door and struck his head against a signal post. He was extremely lucky to survive.Player of the Month July 2001 Hiddy Jahan In later years, as he established himself as a top player on the international scene, Hiddy felt that he did not receive proper support from the Pakistani squash authorities. He thus chose to go on a tour of South Africa during the apartheid era for purely financial reasons. For this, he was banned and his passport impounded. As a result, he moved to the United Kingdom in 1978 (he was able to secure permission to do so partly because of his British wife), and became Britain's top player through to 1984. In the last few years of his top-level career, he played represented England in international competitions including representing England at the 1983 Men's World Team Squash Championships. Hiddy was a close friend of Torsam Khan, the older brother of Jahangir Khan. Hiddy played an important role in helping to groom the young Jahangir, who went on to become the dominant player in the game in the 1980s. Hiddy was runner-up to Jahangir at the British Open in 1982. In recent years, Hiddy has been a very successful squash player in veteran's events. He has won British Open titles at Over-35, Over-40, Over-45 and Over-50 level. Hiddy's younger brothers Zarak Jahan Khan and Zubair Jahan Khan also both became successful professional squash players on the international circuit.

The men's movement is made up of several movements that have differing and often antithetical goals. Major components of the men's movement include the men's liberation movement, profeminist men's movement, mythopoetic men's movement, men's rights movement, and the Christian men's movement, most notably represented by the Promise Keepers. Men's liberation movement The men's movement consisted of \\"networks of men self-consciously involved in activities relating to men and gender. It emerged in the late 1960s and 1970s in Western Culture, alongside and often in response to the women's movement and feminism.\\" Whilst bearing many of the hallmarks of therapeutic, self-help groups, men's movement groupings have increasingly come to view personal growth and better relations with other men as \\"useless without an accompanying shift in the social relations and ideologies that support or marginalise different ways of being men\\". Men's movement activists who are sympathetic to feminist standpoints have been greatly concerned with deconstructing male identity and masculinity. Taking a cue from early feminists who criticized the traditional female gender role, members of the men's liberation movement used the language of sex role theory to argue that the male gender role was similarly restrictive and damaging to men. Pdf. Some men's liberationists decontextualized gender relations and argued that since sex roles were equally harmful to both sexes women and men were equally oppressed. Sociologist Michael Messner writes that by the late 1970s, Pro-feminist men's movements The profeminist men's movement emerged from the men's liberation movement in the mid 1970s. The first Men and Masculinity Conference, held in Tennessee in 1975, was one of the first organized activities by profeminist men in the United States. The profeminist men's movement was influenced by second-wave feminism, the Black Power and student activism movement, the anti-war movement, and LGBT social movements of the 1960s and 1970s. It is the strand of the men's movement that generally embraces the egalitarian goals of feminism. Profeminist men have questioned the cultural ideal of traditional masculinity. They often argue that social expectations and norms have forced men into rigid gender roles, limited men's ability to express themselves, and restricted their choices to behaviors regarded as socially acceptable for men. Moreover, profeminist men have sought to disestablish sexism and reduce discrimination against women. They have campaigned alongside feminists on a variety of issues, including the Equal Rights Amendment, reproductive rights, laws against employment discrimination, affordable child care, and to end sexual violence against women. In more recent decades following the beginning of the profeminist men's movement in the United States, similar and interconnected initiatives have been organized internationally. In 2004, a number of leaders involved with engaging men and boys in gender justice around the world came together to form the global organization MenEngage. Since then MenEngage has organized two international conferences; one in Rio de Janeiro in 2009 and another in New Delhi in 2014. Significant profeminist writers include David Tacey and Raewyn Connell, Robert Jensen, Jackson Katz, and Don Edgar. Men's and fathers' rights movements Men's Rights Movement Rally, India The men's rights movement branched off from the men's liberation movement in the mid- to late 1970s. It focused specifically on issues of perceived discrimination and inequalities faced by men. The MRM has been involved in a variety of issues related to law (including family law, parenting, reproduction and domestic violence), government services (including education, military service and social safety nets) health. The fathers' rights movement is a subset of the men's rights movement. Its members are primarily interested in issues related to family law, including child custody and child support that affect fathers and their children. Prominent men's rights activists include Warren Farrell, Herb Goldberg, Richard Doyle, and Asa Baber. Glenn Sacks is a fathers' rights activist. Mythopoetic men's movement The mythopoetic men's movement is based on spiritual perspectives derived from psychoanalysis, and especially the work of Carl Jung. It is less political than either the profeminist or men's rights movement and has a self-help focus. It is called \\"mythopoetic\\" because of the emphasis on mythology communicated as poetry with some appropriation of indigenous, e.g. Native American, mythology and knowledge. Robert Bly, a leading mythopoetic, has criticized \\"soft men\\" and argued that boys must be initiated into manhood in order to possess \\"Zeus energy\\", which according to Bly is \\"male authority\\" that \\"encompasses intelligence, robust health, compassionate decisiveness, good will, generous leadership\\". Mythopoetic men emphasize \\"elder honouring\\", \\"reclaiming\\" fathers, and \\"unleashing the wild man within\\", but with an emphasis on the impact of fatherlessness on men's psychological development. Masculinity is seen to include deep unconscious patterns and archetypes that are revealed through myth, story and ritual, as supported by theories drawn from analytical or \\"depth\\" psychology. There is some overlap with men's rights and men's liberation perspectives. Activities include: * Male mentoring programs (based on the belief that mature males should help boys to become healthy men) * Ritual, drumming and storytelling camps * Support groups * Attempts at developing curricula for boys' programs in schools Robert Bly, James Hillman, Michael J. Meade, Sam Keen, Robert L. Moore, and Stephen Biddulph are prominent mythopoetic authors. Terminology Sociologists Michael Messner and Michael Flood have argued separately that the term \\"movement\\" is problematic as, unlike other social movements, the men's movement has mostly been focused on self-improvement, is internally contradictory, and consists of members of what they argue is a privileged group.

He was born in Young, New South Wales and died in Manly, New South Wales. In 1900 he won three of his four medals for Australia and one for a mixed team, when he competed as fifth member with four runners from Great Britain and Ireland. Starting for Australia in the short sprint events at the 1900 Olympics, he won bronze medals over 60 metres, 100 metres and 200 metres. His first event was the 100 metres on 14 July, and after finishing second in the semi-final behind Arthur Duffey, he had to go through a repechage, which he won with 11.0 seconds, a few inches ahead of Norman Pritchard of India who was consequently eliminated. In the final race Rowley was unable to match this time and finished in 11.2 seconds to win a bronze medal behind silver medalist Walter Tewksbury, who ran in 11.1s. The 60 metres race on 15 July saw him finish in 7.2 seconds, less than half a metre behind gold medal winner Alvin Kraenzlein and Tewksbury, who won another silver medal. Rowley and Tewksbury would meet one final time, in the 200 metres race held on 22 July. Rowley managed to beat his rival in the heats, but Tewksbury won the final race by a clear margin. Rowley, who finished in 22.9 seconds, also lost to Norman Pritchard and received his third bronze medal. Subsequently, Rowley was persuaded by his English athlete friends to participate on the British team which faced the French team in the 5000 metre team race. The participation was in order, as Australia was still a part of the British Empire and as well as mixed teams were allowed in 1896, 1900 and 1904. The British team needed a fifth runner, and were confident that they could win regardless of how well the fifth runner performed. Thus, the sprinter Rowley, without any experience in longer races, was drafted to fill the quota. Following the first lap Rowley began walking and trailed behind everyone. After the ninth runner crossed the finishing line, Rowley was the only athlete still going and therefore would receive tenth place were he to finish. The race officials decided that it would be pointless for him to walk the final 1,500 metres and awarded him tenth place at the end of his seventh lap. Nonetheless, the British team, including Rowley, beat the French team by three points and won the gold medal. Rowley also won the national championships over 100 and 220 yards in 1898 and 1900. Also he won both these events at the Australasian Championships in 1897 and 1899. He attended Sydney Boys High School from 1890.http://www.shsobu.org.au/wp-content/uploads/sport.pdf References * * (excerpt available at ) Category:1876 births Category:1924 deaths Category:Australian male sprinters Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1900 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic athletes of Australia Category:Olympic gold medalists for Australia Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Australia Category:People from Young, New South Wales Category:Medalists at the 1900 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Olympic bronze medalists in athletics (track and field) ","title":"Stan Rowley"},{"id":"3651543","text":"The Stade F√©lix-Houphou√´t-Boigny, nicknamed Le F√©licia, is a multi-purpose stadium, which can host football, rugby union and athletics, in Abidjan, Ivory Coast.

It was recorded at Windmill Lane Studios in Dublin, Ireland, and reached number 18 in the UK album charts. Recording The album was recorded on dates from September to December 1987 and in January 1988. The Chieftains and Van Morrison had met years before at the Edinburgh rock festival. They joined up in Belfast during Morrison's No Guru tour and afterwards, Morrison and Paddy Moloney discussed recording an album together during a walk. They each had a list of songs and reached a consensus to cover two of Morrison's previously released tracks (the title track was one) and the rest from traditional Irish songs. Recalled Moloney: > I think at that time Van was searching for his Irish roots.

Ahmed Radhi equalized the score from a header in the 31st minute. In the second half, Iraq controlled the match completely with Qatar wasting time in hope for a draw. But, from counter-attack led by Radhi and Hussein Saeed, Saeed scored his last goal with Iraq, being the most goals scorer for Iraq at 78 goals. In the 85th minute, Qatar equalized the score, after the Iraqi audience at Al-Shaab Stadium were sure of their national team claiming the win, by Adel Khamis. The match ended in a 2‚Äì2 draw, which qualified Qatar to the next round of the qualifications. After this match, the Iraqi golden team of the 80s ended with the retiring of Khalil Allawi, Ali Hussein Shihab, Basil Gorgis, Ghanim Oraibi, Ahmad Jassim and Hussein Saeed.

There are four types: ingots, blooms, billets, and slabs. Ingot An aluminum ingot Ingots are large rough castings designed for storage and transportation. The shape usually resembles a rectangle or square with generous fillets. They are tapered, usually with the big-end-down. Bloom In the era of commercial wrought iron, blooms were slag-riddled iron castings poured in a bloomery before being worked into wrought iron. In the era of commercial steel, blooms are intermediate-stage pieces of steel produced by a first pass of rolling (in a blooming mill) that works the ingots down to a smaller cross-sectional area, but still greater than . Blooms are usually further processed via rotary piercing, structural shape rolling and profile rolling. Common final products include structural shapes, rails, rods, and seamless pipes. Billet Steel billets A billet is a length of metal that has a round or square cross- section, with an area less than . Billets are created directly via continuous casting or extrusion or indirectly via hot rolling an ingot or bloom. Billets are further processed via profile rolling and drawing. Final products include bar stock and wire. Centrifugal casting is also used to produce short circular tubes as billets, usually to achieve a precise metallurgical structure. They are commonly used as cylinder sleeves where the inner and outer diameters are ground and machined to length. Because their size is not modified significantly, they are not always classified as semi-finished casting products. In copper production, a billet is a long, about diameter, of pure copper. Slab A slab is a length of metal that is rectangular in cross- section. The slab is created directly by continuous casting or indirectly by rolling an ingot on a slabbing mill. Slabs are usually further processed via flat rolling, skelping, and pipe rolling. Common final products include sheet metal, plates, strip metal, pipes, and tubes.

Literature in English from the former British West Indies may be referred to as Anglo-Caribbean or, in historical contexts, as West Indian literature. Most of these territories have become independent nations since the 1960s, though some retain colonial ties to the United Kingdom. They share, apart from the English language, a number of political, cultural, and social ties which make it useful to consider their literary output in a single category. The more wide-ranging term \\"Caribbean literature\\" generally refers to the literature of all Caribbean territories regardless of language‚Äîwhether written in English, Spanish, French, Hindustani, or Dutch, or one of numerous creoles.Dash, J. Michael. The Other America: Caribbean Literature in a New World Context. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 1998. The literature of Caribbean is exceptional, both in language and subject. Through themes of innocence, exile and return to motherland, resistance and endurance, engagement and alienation, self determination, Caribbean literature provides a powerful platform for Post-Colonial studies and to Caribbean literatures in importance the context of all literature. \\"Caribbean literature\\" vs \\"West Indian literature\\" As scholarship expands, there is debate about the correct term to use for literature that comes from the region. Both terms are often used interchangeably despite having different origins and referring to slightly different groups of people. Since so much of Caribbean identity is linked to \\"insidious racism\\" and \\"the justification of slave labor\\", it is usual to refer to the author of the piece for their identity preference.Safa, Helen I. \\"POPULAR CULTURE, NATIONAL IDENTITY, AND RACE IN THE CARIBBEAN.\\" Nieuwe West-Indische Gids / New West Indian Guide, vol. 61, no. 3/4, 1 Jan. 1987, pp. 115‚Äì126. https://www.jstor.org/stable/41849291 West Indian is defined as coming from the \\"West Indies\\", which includes \\"the islands of the Caribbean\\" and was \\"used first [for] indigenous population, and subsequently both [for] settlers of European origin and of people of African origin brought to the area as slaves.\\" West Indian can also refer to things that can be \\"traced back\\" to the West Indies but the creators \\"live elsewhere\\".\\"West Indian.\\" Oxford English Dictionary, 2018, Oxford University Press. West Indian \\"was a term coined by colonising European powers.\\"Begg, Yusuf. \\"Cocktail Conversations: West Indian Vs Caribbean.\\" The Economic Times, Economic Times, 13 Nov. 2011, economictimes.indiatimes.com/cocktail- conversations-west-indian-vs-caribbean/articleshow/10707160.cms. Caribbean, on the other hand, is defined as \\"of the Caribbean...its people, and their cultures\\" only.\\"Caribbean.\\" Oxford English Dictionary, 2018, Oxford University Press. Further issues include language classifications like Creole Caribbean literature and Anglophone Caribbean literature. Different languages also make different references to the texts. While there is no terminology that is obsolete, the issue requires acknowledgement due to it being literature of historically oppressed people.Safa, Helen I. \\"POPULAR CULTURE, NATIONAL IDENTITY, AND RACE IN THE CARIBBEAN.\\" Nieuwe West-Indische Gids / New West Indian Guide, vol. 61, no. 3/4, 1 Jan. 1987, pp. 115‚Äì126. https://www.jstor.org/stable/41849291 The Spanish Caribbean islands include Cuba, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, and Panama as well as the islands of Venezuela and the Caribbean coast of Colombia. Territories included in the category West Indian The literature of Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Cura√ßao, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, Saint Martin, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Turks and Caicos and the U.S. Virgin Islands would normally be considered to belong to the wider category of West Indian literature. Development of the concept of West Indian literature The term \\"West Indies\\" first began to achieve wide currency in the 1950s, when writers such as Samuel Selvon, John Hearne, Edgar Mittelholzer, V. S. Naipaul, and George Lamming began to be published in the United Kingdom.Ramchand, Kenneth. The West Indian Novel and Its Background. London: Faber, 1970. A sense of a single literature developing across the islands was also encouraged in the 1940s by the BBC radio programme Caribbean Voices, which featured stories and poems written by West Indian authors, recorded in London under the direction of founding producer Una Marson and later Henry Swanzy, and broadcast back to the islands.Griffith, Glyne. \\"Deconstructing Nationalisms: Henry Swanzy, Caribbean Voices and the Development of West Indian Literature\\", Small Axe, Number 10 (Volume 5, Number 2), September 2001, pp. 1‚Äì20. Magazines such as Kyk-Over-Al in Guyana, Bim in Barbados, and Focus in Jamaica, which published work by writers from across the region, also encouraged links and helped build an audience.Dalleo, Raphael. Caribbean Literature and the Public Sphere: From the Plantation to the Postcolonial. Charlottesville: University of Virginia Press, 2012. Many‚Äîperhaps most‚ÄîWest Indian writers have found it necessary to leave their home territories and base themselves in the United Kingdom, the United States, or Canada in order to make a living from their work‚Äîin some cases spending the greater parts of their careers away from the territories of their birth. Critics in their adopted territories might argue that, for instance, V. S. Naipaul ought to be considered a British writer instead of a Trinidadian writer, or Jamaica Kincaid and Paule Marshall American writers, but most West Indian readers and critics still consider these writers \\"West Indian\\". West Indian literature ranges over subjects and themes as wide as those of any other \\"national\\" literature, but in general many West Indian writers share a special concern with questions of identity, ethnicity, and language that rise out of the Caribbean historical experience. Marlon James at the 2010 Brooklyn Book Festival One unique and pervasive characteristic of Caribbean literature is the use of \\"dialect\\" forms of the national language, often termed creole. The various local variations in the language adopted from the colonial powers such as Britain, Spain, Portugal, France and the Netherlands, have been modified over the years within each country and each has developed a blend that is unique to their country. Many Caribbean authors in their writing switch liberally between the local variation‚Äînow commonly termed nation language‚Äîand the standard form of the language. Two West Indian writers have won the Nobel Prize for Literature: Derek Walcott (1992), born in St. Lucia, resident mostly in Trinidad during the 1960s and '70s, and partly in the United States since then; and V. S. Naipaul, born in Trinidad and resident in the United Kingdom since 1950. (Saint-John Perse, who won the Nobel Prize in 1960, was born in the French territory of Guadeloupe.) Other notable names in (anglophone) Caribbean literature have included Una Marson, Earl Lovelace, Austin Clarke, Claude McKay, Louise Bennett, Orlando Patterson, Andrew Salkey, Edward Kamau Brathwaite (who was born in Barbados and has lived in Ghana and Jamaica), Linton Kwesi Johnson, Velma Pollard and Michelle Cliff, to name only a few. In more recent times, a number of literary voices have emerged from the Caribbean as well as the Caribbean diaspora, including Kittitian Caryl Phillips (who has lived in the UK since one month of age); Edwidge Danticat, a Haitian immigrant to the United States; Anthony Kellman from Barbados, who divides his time between Barbados and the United States; Andrea Levy of the United Kingdom; Jamaicans Alecia McKenzie, who has lived in Belgium, Singapore and France, and Colin Channer and Marlon James, the author of the Man Booker Prize-winning novel A Brief History of Seven Killings (2014) (as well as John Crow's Devil, The Book of Night Women, the unpublished screenplay \\"Dead Men\\", and the short story \\"Under Cover of Darkness\\"), Antiguan Marie-Elena John, and Lasana M. Sekou from St. Maarten/St. Martin. Themes of migration, landscape, nature  Caribbean lands and seas have been depicted as a paradise on earth by foreign artists and writers. Scholars and writers in Postcolonial Studies have research and published on this cultural phenomenon of an empty island, and the racist implications of a fantasy void of local people and their cultures. Caribbean classic novels such as Jean Rhys's Wide Sargasso Sea (1966) have inspired films, stories, and poems by other artists who seek to decolonize the relationship of people and landscapes. Caribbean novelists imbue island landscape with bustling life of the locals and migrants.The migration of Caribbean workers to the Panama Canal is often used as a narrative foundation. Maryse Cond√©‚Äôs novel Tree of Life (1992) discusses the involvement of family ties and how people seek to improve their lot in life by working to build the Panama Canal. Another contemporary classic about migrant cultures isRamabai Espinet‚Äôs novel The Swinging Bridge (2003), which explores trauma of displacement, Indian indentureship, and the phenomena of invisibility relating to women. Caribbean stories and poems are ripe with references to storms, hurricanes, and natural disasters. Derek Walcott's wrote \\"The Sea is History,\\" and dramatized the impact of tropical storms and hurricanes on the locals. Caribbean writing deploys agricultural symbolism to represent the complexities of colonial rule and the intrinsic values of the lands. Native fruits and vegetables appear in colonized and decolonizing discourse. Derek Walcott describes the complications of colonialism using local fruit metaphors, such as star apples, in his poetry to connote the complexity of acidity and the sweetness. Giannina Braschi's postcolonial work United States of Banana imagines a political and economic deal deal between China and Puerto Rico as the exchange of a bowl of rice for a bowl of beans, and a Lychee for a Quenepa.  Poetry  Caribbean poetry is vast and rapidly evolving field of poetry written by people from the Caribbean region and the diaspora. Caribbean poetry generally refers to a myriad of poetic forms, spanning epic, lyrical verse, prose poems, dramatic poetry and oral poetry, composed in Caribbean territories regardless of language. It is most often, however, written in English, Spanish, Spanglish, French, Hindustani, Dutch, or any number of creoles. Poetry in English from the former British West Indies have be referred to as Anglo-Caribbean poetry or West Indian poetry. Since the mid-1970s, Caribbean poetry has gained increasing visibility with the publication in Britain and North America of several anthologies. Over the decades the canon has shifted and expanded, drawing both on oral and literary traditions and including more women poets and politically charged works. Caribbean writers, performance poets, newspaper poets, singer- songwriters have created a popular art form, a poetry heard by audiences all over the world. Caribbean oral poetry shares the vigour of the written tradition. Among the most prominent Caribbean poets whose works are widely studied (and translated into other languages) are: Derek Walcott (who won the 1992 Nobel Prize for Literature), Kamau Brathwaite, Edouard Glissant, Giannina Braschi, Lorna Goodinson, Aim√© Fernand C√©saire, Linton Kwesi Johnson, Kwame Dawes, and Claudia Rankine. Common themes include: exile and return to the motherland; the relationship of language to nation; colonialism and postcolonialism; self-determination and liberty; racial identity.  Women writers  There is great abundance of talent, styles, and subjected covered by Caribbean women writers spanning the genres of poetry, theater, short stories, essays, and novels. There is also a burgeoning field of scholarship on how women authors address women's lives under dictatorships, eroticism and the body, history and identity, migration, Afro Caribbean history, decolonization, revolution, queer theory, among countless other topics. Major novelists include Maryse Conde (Guadeloupe), Merle Hodge (Trinidad), Paul Marshall, Elizabeth Nunez (Trinidad-American ), Tiphanie Yanique (Virgin Islands), Rosario Ferre (Puerto Rico), and Michelle Cliff (Jamaica). Poets include Mahadai Das (Guyana), Lenelle Mo√Øse (Haiti), Pamela Mordecai (Jamaica), Lorna Goodison (Jamaica), Julia de Burgos (Puerto Rico), Giannina Braschi (Puerto Rico), Merle Collins (Greneda), Shara McCallum (Jamaica), and Oliver Senior (Jamaica). Playwrights include Una Marson who wrote in English, and Ina C√©saire (Martinique) and Simone Schwarz-Bart (France/Guadeloupe) who write in French.  Epics  There are many epic stories, plays, and poems written in and about the Caribbean. Dating to the 16th century, Juan de Castellanos's Elegy to the Illustrious Gentlemen of the Indies (1589) is an epic in verse that traces Columbus's arrival to the conquest of Cuba, Jamaica, Trinidad, and Margarita. The work relates Juan Ponce de Leon's colonization of Puerto Rico in search for the mythic fountain of youth. Later epics of the Spanish West Indies include Manuel de Jesus Galvan's national epic \\"The Sword and the Cross\\" (1954) that relates the myths and histories of the colony of Hispaniola. In the 20th Century epics approach subjects such racist legacies, economic terrorism, and the decolonization of Caribbean culture and politics. Nobel prize winner Derek Walcott pens one of greatest modern epic written in the English language, Omeros (1990). This epic poem is divided into seven books containing sixty-four chapters. Most of the poem is composed in a three- line form that is reminiscent of the terza rima form that Dante used for The Divine Comedy. The work uses local island folklore and ancient Greek myths such as Homer' Iliad to address legacies of Greek, Roman, and American culture including racism and slavery. Parts of the story occur on Walcott's native island St. Lucia, but there are also time travels to ancient Greece and Rome, as well as travels to modern day Lisbon, London, Dublin, Toronto. Giannina Braschi's Empire of Dreams (1988) is a postmodern epic composed of six books of poetry that blend elements of eclogues, epigrams, lyrics, prose poem, diary, jingles, Puerto Rican folklore, and political manifesto. The work traces the history of the Spanish language from medieval times to contemporary Puerto Rico, Cuban, Chicano, and Nuyorican culture. Braschi's later epic, written in English, is United States of Banana (2011), a geopolitical tragic- comedy about the fall of the American empire, the liberation of Puerto Rico, and the realignment of powers among Caribbean nations. Mixing elements of poetry, lyric essay, Caribbean songs, and socratic dialogues, this epic tackles the subjects of global debt, financial terrorism, and decolonization. Trinidadian playwright and novelist Earl Lovelace's work has been described as performative epics that mix the rhythms of steelband and calypso with complex narratives about black power and the political, spiritual, and psychic struggles for decolonization. His best known works are The Dragon Can‚Äôt Dance (1979) and Salt (1996) which won the Commonwealth Book Prize. Literary festivals Many parts of the Caribbean have begun in recent years to host literary festivals, including in Anguilla, the Anguilla Lit Fest, in Trinidad and Tobago the NGC Bocas Lit Fest, in Jamaica the Calabash International Literary Festival, in Saint Martin/Sint Maarten the St. Martin Book Fair, in Barbados Bim Literary Festival, in Dominica the Nature Island Literary Festival and Book Fair, Alliouagana Festival of the word in Montserrat, and the Antigua and Barbuda Literary Festival.

He joined Rover, run by his uncles Maurice and Spencer Wilks, in 1945 and worked initially on the gas- turbine powered JET1 and T3 experimental prototypes. In 1959, he became chief engineer of new vehicle projects and is best known for his leadership of the teams that developed the advanced Rover P6 series, introduced as the 2000 in 1963, and the hugely successful Range Rover (of which a \\"CSK\\" special edition later celebrated his involvement) launched in June 1970. As well, he was responsible for the Rover-based Marauder sports car in 1950 and many Rover experimental and prototype vehicles. As Rover was taken over by the Leyland Motor Corporation which subsequently became British Leyland (BL), he also led teams responsible for the Triumph TR6, Triumph Stag and Triumph TR7 models as well as the innovative design of the 16-valve cylinder head used on the Triumph Dolomite Sprint. Several other BL Group models were developed under his leadership but during a chaotic time for the British motor industry, King was frequently frustrated by the design compromises imposed by lack of adequate funding, and the poor quality of vehicles produced by an uncooperative workforce in the diverse and mainly outdated plants owned by the company. While chairman of BL Technology from 1979 he was responsible for developing a series of light, aerodynamic and technically advanced ECV (Energy Conservation Vehicle) experimental models (including the ECV3), features of which were incorporated into later BL Group products such as the Rover K-series engine, or adopted by other manufacturers. Spen King retired from the company in 1985. In 2004, he criticised SUV owners who drive their vehicles in urban areas, saying that vehicles like the Range Rover he created were \\"never intended as a status symbol but later incarnations of my design seem to be intended for that purpose\\". Spen King and his former Rover colleague Arthur Goddard extensively shared many of their views on the motor industry in 2010. The transcript of their discussion was published in the book They Found Our Engineer in 2011. It was announced on 28 June 2010 that King had died on 26 June after suffering complications following a cycling accident.

The earldom of Northumbria was the successor of the earldom of Bamburgh. In the seventh century, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira were united in the kingdom of Northumbria, but this was destroyed by the Vikings in 867. Southern Northumbria, the former Deira, then became the Viking kingdom of York, while English earls ruled the former northern kingdom of Bernicia from their base at Bamburgh. The northern part of Bernicia was lost to the Scots, probably in the late tenth century. In 1006 Uhtred the Bold was earl of Bamburgh, and √Üthelred the Unready appointed him earl of York as well, re-uniting the area of Northumbria still under English control into a single earldom. Uhtred was murdered in 1016, and Cnut then appointed Eric of Hlathir earl of Northumbria at York, but Uhtred's dynasty held onto Bernicia until 1041, when the earldom was again united. A descendant of Uhtred, Gospatric, was appointed earl by William the Conqueror in 1067, but William expelled him in 1072.

De Vries taught composition at the Rotterdam Conservatory until his retirement in 2009. Biography Klaas de Vries was born on 15 July 1944 in Terneuzen, in the province of Zeeland in the Netherlands. From 1965 to 1972 he studied piano, theory and composition on the conservatory of Rotterdam. He continued studying composition from 1972 at the conservatory of The Hague with the Dutch composer , winning the composition prize there in 1974. After winning this prize de Vries studied with the Croatian composer Milko Kelemen in Stuttgart, Germany. De Vries won the Matthijs Vermeulen Award twice: in 1984 for his work discantus (1982) and in 1998 for his opera A King, Riding and the Interludium for string orchestra (1996). From 1972 to 1981 de Vries started to teach theory at the former conservatory of Twente, and he was appointed as a lecturer in theory, instrumentation, and composition at the conservatory of Rotterdam in 1979. Among his many students at this school, today also known as the Rotterdam School, are Thorkell Atlason, Antonio Pinho Vargas, Ant√≥nio Chagas Rosa, Oscar van Dillen, Andreas Kunstein, Sergio Luque, C√©sar de Oliveira, Juan Felipe Waller, Philemon Mukarno, Astrid Kruisselbrink, Florian Magnus Maier, Felipe Perez Santiago, Joey Roukens, Edward Top, Jian-Hua Zhuang, Evrim Demirel, Gerda Geertens and Rob Zuidam. De Vries gave master classes in Brussels, Paris, Manchester, Porto, Moscow and San Francisco. In the 1970s de Vries got involved in the organization of the STAMP-concerts, in cooperation with Theo Loevendie. Since the 1980s de Vries got involved in the organization of the STAMP-concerts, in cooperation with Theo Loevendie. Since the 1980s de Vries has also been active, together with the composer Peter-Jan Wagemans, in the organization of the Unanswered Question foundation. This foundation concentrated on performing the works of the composition departments of the conservatories of Rotterdam, Amsterdam, The Hague and Utrecht. The compositions of de Vries are being performed, among others, by the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra and the ASKO Ensemble. Compositional style =Early influences= From his studies with Otto Ketting De Vries developed a fascination for Stravinsky, Bart√≥k and Berg. Stravinsky is the largest influence for The Hague school of composers: The Hague school can be characterized by the usage of collage-like harmonic blocks, a way of composing associated with composers as Louis Andriessen. Although getting to compositional maturity in this surrounding, it did not take long for de Vries to realize the limitations of this style. Nevertheless, de Vries continued to use an anti-romantic approach to musical writing, shared with The Hague school (Oskamp 11-29). Another technique learned from Otto Ketting is serialism, though this never really fascinated him (Schneeweisz 8). Apart from one work, namely Refrains (1968) for two piano's and orchestra, he never felt comfortable using serialistic techniques. He was to abandon this approach quickly (Oskamp 123). De Vries' further influences came from the music of Var√®se, Charles Ives and improvised music (Schneeweisz 8-9). From these composers he learned an open-mindedness towards musical composition, which made him able to follow his own musical path. =Mature style= De Vries' compositions can be described as a search for an own musical identity, the main goal being the creation of a style of writing in which he can be freed from given compositional necessities. The music of Berio influenced him to abandon The Hague school style and its static harmonic blocks. In his work bewegingen (English: movements) (1979) he experimented with the usage of fluent transitions and continuity (Oskamp 124). De Vries puts more focus on his own notes to be convincing themselves, instead of the notes being the result of pre-compositional systems (Schneeweisz 10, 11). In this sense he is highly aware of the fact that it is not possible to entirely envision what effect the written notes will have on a listener. His approach towards composition can be described as speculative (Klis 388-389). To be able to give meaning to his written notes, De Vries turned for instance to the symbolism of Baroque techniques, such as the falling motive to illustrate the idea of death. De Vries also turned his attention towards the re-usage of music of the past (Wenekes 30), as exemplified by his Organum (1971), in which he re- introduced Perotinus' style in a modern setting. In his works de Vries tries to create a balance between structure and expression. One thing evolves from the other. Not just individual elements or sequences, but whole works (Schneeweisz 11-12). =Literary influences= In his quest for finding new ways of expression in his music de Vries also turned to literature. In his chamber opera Er√©ndira (1984) he uses the novel of Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez. Together with the usage of instruments as the mandolin and guitar, this music evokes an exotic atmosphere (Wennekes 28). De Vries' sonata (1987) for piano solo marks a turning-point which led to an even more important role of extra- musical influences (Schneeweisz 12). The 'sonata' itself is based on the novel Dr. Faustus by Thomas Mann. De Vries is also greatly inspired by the novels of Latin-American authors, especially by the works the Argentine author Jorge Louis Borges. In his works Borges creates a large variety of mysterious repeats form a constantly recurring theme. We can see a similar trend in de Vries' compositional philosophy. As it is not possible to envision entirely the effect of written music on a listener, he or she will discover new facets in a work when subsequently listening to it. It is with this that de Vries tries to play by introducing repetition and variations on musical elements, bringing him close to the philosophy of the Argentine author (Klis 390). Borges' idea to create alternative histories in his novels highly fascinates de Vries. In his trilogy De profundis, ...sub nocte per umbras..., Diafon√≠a (1988‚Äì1991), de Vries reconstructs the past. The ...Sub nocte per umbras... (1989) deals with an alternative reconstruction of music from the antiquity. Diafon√≠a (1988‚Äì1989) deals with a re-invention of folk music. The last work of the three, De profundis (1991) de Vries combines musical material from the first two works (Oskamp 122). A further source of inspiration is the Portuguese author Fernando Pessoa, whose poems de Vries uses regularly. Pessoa's poem Abdica√ßao de Vries is used by de Vries for his work Abdica√ßao (1996) for a cappella choir. This and other poems return in his opera A King, Riding (1996) (Wenekes 28). De Vries' also works closely together with authors. His opera Wake (2010) is based on the Enschede fireworks disaster in 2000, when a firework storage facility exploded and devastated an entire part of the city. The libretto is written by the English author David Mitchell in close cooperation with de Vries. The title of the opera is an allusion to Finnegans Wake by the Irish novelist James Joyce (NPSpodium, Wind). The opera A King, Riding =Multiple identities= The opera A King, Riding (1996) can be seen as one of de Vries' largest and most successful works until now. The opera is based on the book The Waves by the English author Virginia Woolf. The title refers to a passage form the book. De Vries also uses three poems by Pessoa. The Waves is made out of monologues by six different personages and deals with their individual, intellectual and emotional world. There is a seventh personage, called Percival who never speaks. He is only referred to by the six speaking personages who speak about him in a subjective way. Although Percival never speaks, he is the connecting figure among the six personages. His true identity remains a mystery. The poems of Pessoa form a moment of reflection on the Woolf story. figure 1. The fundamental chord used in A King, RidingThe idea of multiple identities, to be found in the book, is the largest source of inspiration for de Vries. 'There is not one stable identity but many in which the reader moves from the one to the other' (Deurzen 215). The opera is based on the question about the essence of identity (Oskamp 125). In A King, Riding the six personages are depicted by six singing voices accompanied by six instruments. Percival, the seventh character, also has a solo instrument, but no singing voice as he never speaks. This led to de Vries' concept of double personages; the symbiosis of the singing part and the solo instrument forms the personage as a whole (Deurzen 216). The solo instruments are accompanied by electronic sounds. These electronically created sounds have both the singing voices as the solo instruments as their source. A multi-layered idea of identity is then created. The first layer is formed by the singing voices. The second layer is formed by the solo-instrumental shadow, it has the same characteristics but is more vague and flexible than the voice. The third layer is formed by the electronics, the solo instruments are still recognizable, but get distorted (Deurzen 218). =Compositional techniques= The work has a fundamental chord which works as a building block in harmonic sense for the entire work. All other chords and harmonies are derived from this chord. The chord, depicted as figure 1, is made out of combinations of dominant seventh chords, combined with each other. The result is a harmonic language which sounds chromatic and dissonant, but still gives a feeling of movement (Zuidam 40). In melodic sense A King, Riding works with a basic melodic curve, and gets altered throughout the piece. This process happens partially through the use of electronics. It is split up in smaller entities, mirrored and changes are added. In rhythmic sense we can find a lot of proportional values (Zuidam 40). Another important aspect is the use of Baroque rhetoric. The solo instruments accentuate the emotional state of the singing voices using special intervals and special rhythmic patterns. Also the work as a whole is built as a modern passion: solo arias are being varied with instrumental and ensemble parts. These parts, among which the Pessoa poems, are built as baroque chorals and madrigals using polyphonic techniques. The poems are presented as \\"heterophonies\\" (Deurzen 217). The work was premiered the 21st of May 1996, at the Royal Circus in Brussels. The work was performed by the joined forces of ASKO and Sch√∂nberg Ensemble, conducted by Reinbert de Leeuw.

Willson, the owner of a sloop who was licensed under federal navigation laws, the Sally, broke through a dam that blocked his passage which was built by the Black-Bird Creek Marsh Co. and had been authorized to do so by Delaware law. The company brought a case against Willson, claiming Delaware authorized the building of the dam through a law which was passed under the police power of the state in order to clean up a health hazard and there was no legislation by Congress dealing with the same subject matter. Willson claimed that the law authorizing the building of the dam was a violation of the commerce clause. He believed he had a constitutional right to navigating coastal streams and Delaware's actions were motivated by private profits. Chief Justice John Marshall affirmed the lower court's decision, that because no federal law dealt specifically with the situation, and the state law did not violate Congress' Dormant Commerce Clause power, the state law was valid. He did note, however, that the dam might interfere with interstate commerce.Gillman, Graber, and Whittington 2013, p. 223.

Femoyer joined the Enlisted Reserve Corps on November 11, 1942 and was called to active duty in February 1943. He took basic training at Miami Beach, Florida, aircrew training at the University of Pittsburgh, and became an aviation cadet at the Mississippi Institute of Aeronautics in Jackson but failed his pilot training. In 1944, he graduated from the Army Air Force (AAF) Flexible Gunnery School at Fort Myers, Florida, and the AAF Navigation School at Selman Field, Louisiana. From his training assignments, he went to the European Theater in September 1944, as a second lieutenant and was assigned to the 447th Bomb Group's 711th Bombardment Squadron. Six weeks later, on November 2, 1944, he was the navigator of a B-17 Flying Fortress on a bombing mission over Merseburg, Germany, his bomber was struck by three antiaircraft shells and he was wounded. He was in pain and had significant blood loss, but refused morphine in order to keep his head clear while he continued to navigate the bomber for two and a half hours, changing course six times to avoid enemy antiaircraft fire. He remained alert though his pain was described as \\"almost beyond the realm of human endurance\\". Once the airplane was in safe airspace over the English Channel, Femoyer finally agreed to an injection of morphine; but thirty minutes after landing he died of wounds.

Baile an Teampaill Verified 2011-02-07. The village is situated on the east side of the city with its limits extending to the River Lee and the village of Blackrock further to the east. Originally, Ballintemple was a separate village but today it has been enclosed by the city. History Grave marker in Temple Hill burial ground Temple Hill, Churchyard Lane, and Ballintemple itself derive their names from an ecclesiastical and burial site at the top of Temple Hill.Folio 6 of the \\"Grand Jury Map\\" of 1811 (survey from 1790s) notes the \\"Church of Ballintemple\\" to east, and marginally south of the junction between Churchyard lane and Boreenmanna While some historical texts suggest that this graveyard was sited at an early medieval church of the Knights Templar, this is not supported by other texts, and modern historians assert that this association is incorrect. Whatever the case, while the graveyard remains, no archaeological evidence of an adjoining church has been subject to modern survey. The graveyard itself has been subject to survey, and while it may have been used in the early medieval period, the earliest recorded burial event was that of the entrails of Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton who was killed in the 1690 Siege of Cork and whose intestines were removed and buried here to preserve the body prior to transport back to England. The earliest remaining extant burial markers (with discernable dates) are dated to the early 18th Century. The antiquary and folklorist Thomas Crofton Croker surveyed the graveyard in the early 19th century. Croker records a folksong relating to the graveyard as well as documenting a marker for an 18th-century burial of a Lieutenant Henry Richard Temple who died with his young wife during a journey from the Caribbean (via Ireland) to England. During one such survey in the early 1800s, Croker was chased by locals who mistook his survey for grave robbery. The graveyard is accessible but closed to new burials (save to a few families with existing burial rights). Other memorial markers in Ballintemple include the McCarthy Monument (constructed in the 19th Century at Diamond Hill to honour ex-MP Alexander McCarthy), and a plaque at the junction of Ardfoyle and Blackrock road (commemorating the 1798 hanging in Ballintemple of an accused United Irishman). The ruins of Dundanion Castle lie close to P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh by the River Lee. William Penn, the founder of the state of Pennsylvania, is said to have departed from here on his journey to the United States in 1682. Some time earlier, Sir Walter Raleigh is reported to have spent some time here before setting off on his final voyage to the West Indies in August 1617. George Boole, the mathematician and inventor of Boolean algebra, lived in Ballintemple during the nineteenth century whilst professor at University College Cork. He died in December 1864, after catching pneumonia as the result of a rain storm whilst walking the four miles between his house and the university to give a lecture. The old, abandoned Beaumont Quarry lies adjacent to P√°irc U√≠ Rinn and Temple Hill. In its time, it provided limestone blocks for some of the notable buildings of Cork City. Prior to the expansion of Cork's suburbs in the 20th century, Ballintemple (as with nearby Ballinlough and Flower Lodge) was also home to a number of market gardens and nurseries - such as that of William Baylor Hartland. Amenities The Blackrock Road runs through the heart of the village which has a post office, some small shops, and two public houses ‚Äì The Venue and The Temple Inn (known locally as Longboats). The Lavanagh Centre is also located in the village, and offers services to the physically handicapped - including physical therapy in its swimming pool. Stadia and events Crowds in Ballintemple before a sporting event P√°irc U√≠ Rinn and P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh, both owned by the Gaelic Athletic Association, are based in the area. These are used by various Cork GAA teams and clubs for hurling and Gaelic football matches, and contribute to congestion in the area on match- days and when used for special events. Also close-by to Temple Hill are the grounds of Cork Constitution Football Club. On the eastern side of P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh is the Atlantic Pond, which was built as part of the scheme to drain the marshy area next to the River Lee and which is now used by walkers and runners. The showgrounds of the Munster Agricultural Society also adjoin P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh and prior to 2012 were used for occasional agricultural exhibitions. Cork City Council proposed a broad redevelopment of the showgrounds, P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh and Atlantic Pond areas, under a master plan for the \\"Marina Park\\" area. The proposed development included considerable changes to P√°irc U√≠ Chaoimh, which were completed during 2017, with additional works to follow. Transport An open top tram in Ballintemple with a Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company service (c.1910) Ballintemple is served by a single city bus route, number 202, which runs from Mahon, through Blackrock, Ballintemple, Cork City Centre, to Gurranabraher and Knocknaheeny. The nearest currently active railway station is Kent Station Cork. However, from 1850 to 1932, the line of the Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway ran just north of the village centre. From 1880 to 1932, there was a station along this stretch of line called the Show Ground Halt railway station, and this served Ballintemple. The area was also previously served by trams.

Within the department, there are twelve primary divisions: The Chief of Police, Internal Affairs, Development Bureau, Investigations, Traffic Enforcement, Crime Analysis Unit, Public Information Office, Towing Administration, Property & Evidence, Operations Bureau, Technology, Records, and Special Operations.City of Tallahassee Police Department November 2, 2018 History The city's police force began operation in 1826, shortly after the city was incorporated, with a single City Marshal constituting the police force. From time to time, special police were hired as circumstances warranted. A compulsory Night Watch was also instituted for a period of time before the Civil War. The Tallahassee Police Department once claimed to be the oldest continuously-operated police department in the American South, and possibly the second-oldest in the U.S., preceded only by the Philadelphia Police Department established in 1758. The Boston Police Department was established in 1838. Larger east coast cities followed with New York City and Baltimore in 1845. However, one must consider that Colonial America must certainly have had municipal police forces, but lack of verifiable records may make it difficult, if not impossible, to accurately rank police forces from oldest to newest. Furthermore, Southern public officials (including marshals), were suspended from public office by the occupying Federal troops during the post-Civil War Reconstruction period. Therefore, Tallahassee's police force ceased to operate for a brief period in mid-1865 until municipal officials were returned to power in 1866. To illustrate the difficulty in ranking municipal police forces from oldest to newest, Pensacola, Florida‚Äîfor example‚Äîbegan its police force as early as 1822‚Äîpredating Tallahassee's. With Reconstruction and civil rights bestowed on black citizens, for several years during the 1870s, much of the Tallahassee City Council and the entire police force‚Äîincluding the City Marshal‚Äîwere black. Also during this period, the only two blacks ever to serve as Leon County Sheriff until November 2016 occupied that post. But, the era of the black Southern public official was short lived and, with passage of Florida's 1885 Constitution (replacing the 1868 \\"carpetbagger\\" Constitution), black suffrage was effectively quashed. Control of public offices became white-only (until the 1964 Civil Rights Act). In 1892, the position of City Marshal was renamed to Chief of Police. This appointee was typically nominated by the Mayor and ratified by the City Council. After the 1920 change from a strong mayor form of government to the Commission-Manager form of government, the City Commission appointed the Police Chief‚Äîuntil the late 1920s‚Äîwhen the Police Chief became an employee appointed directly by the City Manager without input from the City Commission.

This type of community involvement embodies the \\"Trust, Loyalty and Commitment\\" that are the fundamental foundations through which Chief Michael J. DeLeo leads the Tallahassee Police Department. Public resources Tallahassee Online Police Statistics (TOPS) - Launched on August 1, 2007, this web-based crime mapping application allows the public to examine over two dozen crime incident types for the previous six months. Searches include addresses, parks, neighborhoods and Tallahassee Police Crime Watch areas. On August 15, 2008, TOPS version 2.0 was launched, adding new features and a new interface. The site can be accessed via the Tallahassee municipal portal or the Tallahassee- Leon County GIS I-Maps website.  Controversies  = Drug sting resulting in death of Rachel Hoffman = The Tallahassee Police Department was the subject of intense scrutiny after a botched buy-bust operation ended in a fatal tragedy on May 7, 2008 with the execution style murder of 23-year-old Rachel Hoffman. Hoffman, a recent graduate of Florida State University who had been convicted of drug charges, was serving in an undercover capacity, alone, when she was murdered by two suspected drug dealers while nearly twenty TPD officers and a DEA plane were supervising the operation. A Grand Jury investigation was highly critical of the planning and execution of the operation, and a subsequent TPD internal affairs investigation found negligence and multiple policy violations by the Vice squad and individual police officers involved. Following Hoffman's death, the Florida legislature enacted \\"Rachel's Law\\" and established minimum guidelines for law enforcement to use when engaging civilians in undercover operations. In a civil suit alleging wrongful death, the City of Tallahassee paid the Hoffman family $2.6 million in damages.Pawns in the War on Drugs : The New Yorker = Legal challenge = In 2008 a Tallahassee resident, Robert Brayshaw, was arrested for violating a Florida statute which prohibited individuals from \\"maliciously, with intent to obstruct the due execution of the law or with the intent to intimidate, hinder or interrupt any law enforcement officer in the legal performance of his or her duties, publish or disseminate the residence address or telephone number of any law enforcement officer while designating the officer as such...\\" Brayshaw had posted, online, the name of a Tallahassee police officer, along with her home address, cell phone number and age, and had further criticized the officer, stating that she was verbally abusive, rude and unprofessional. Brayshaw brought an action in federal court, challenging the constitutionality of the Florida statute, claiming a right to free speech under the First Amendment. The case was heard in U.S. District Court. On April 30, 2010, Judge Richard Smoak ruled in favor of Brayshaw, striking down the 1972 Florida law, finding that the statute was \\"unconstitutional on its face\\". Smoak also ordered the city of Tallahassee to pay Brayshaw's legal expenses of $25,000.Federal Court Strikes Down Florida Statute That Criminalized Free Speech When Criticizing Police Officers, May 3, 2010 ACLU Issues Federal Judge Order With Officer's Personal Information Published By Judge That Resulted In False Arrest]Randall C. Marshall, Legal Director Of The ACLU Publishes Article Of Unconstitutional Law And False Arrest, July 5, 2010Is Tallahassee Police Department Violating City Watchdog's Free Speech?, October 16, 2012 = Investigation of alleged sexual assault = On April 16, 2014, The New York Times reported irregularities in the investigation of an alleged sexual assault involving Florida State University quarterback Jameis Winston. A medical examination of the unnamed female revealed injuries consistent with sexual contact‚Äîbruises, semen‚Äîand the woman would later identify Jameis Winston by name as her alleged attacker. Tallahassee police did not promptly obtain a DNA sample from Winston. When police contacted Winston by phone, he initially delayed responding. Then, on advice from his attorney, Winston declined to be interviewed. The initial TPD investigation did not uncover the fact that a video of the sexual encounter had been taken by Seminoles teammate Chris Casher. The video was later deleted or lost by Casher. = Shooting of Tony McDade = On May 27, 2020, a white TPD officer shot 38-year-old African-American Tony McDade, a 38-year-old transman, following reports of a fatal stabbing in Leon Arms Apartments. The evening before the incident, McDade was physically assaulted. He later posted a video on Facebook in which he vowed to kill his attackers and would rather die at the hands of police than return to prison. The incident drew criticism as official police statements described McDade as a \\"woman\\" who \\"identified as a man\\". Eye witness statements to local media contradicted police statements that McDade was armed with a gun at the time. A vigil was organised for May 28, this being the third police-shooting (after Wilbon Cleveland Woodard, and Mychael Johnson) since the appointment of Ravell as Chief of Police in December 2019.

The company produces high-definition recordings of music in a variety of genres, including jazz, classical, pop, R&B;, folk and world/ethnic. Chesky artists include McCoy Tyner, Herbie Mann, David Johansen and the Harry Smiths, Joe Henderson, Macy Gray, Chuck Mangione, Paquito D'Rivera, Ron Carter, Larry Coryell, John Pizzarelli, Bucky Pizzarelli, Babatunde Olatunji, Ana Caram, and Rebecca Pidgeon. Chesky Records also offers binaural recordings, which seeks to replicate 3-D stereo sound so that the recording sounds as if the listener is in the same room with the musicians. They capture this sound using dummy head recording. For its recordings, Chesky Records uses acoustically vibrant spaces, including the Hirsch Center in Greenpoint, Brooklyn and St. Paul the Apostle Church located in Manhattan. The company has a mastering studio in New York City, New York.  History  Studio musician and composer David Chesky founded Chesky Records with his brother Norman in 1978. They began the label to preserve the sound of live-in- the studio recordings, without overdubbing original records. In 1990, they switched from recording in studios to recording in churches. One of the company's first attempts at improving sound quality was the re-issue of classical pianist Earl Wild's recordings of Rachmaninoff for Reader's Digest. In 1990, Chesky Records released its Jazz Sampler & Audiophile Test Compact Disc, with the first nine tracks devoted to music and the remaining twenty devoted to listening and technical tests for headphones and loud speakers. Other test discs include Dr. Chesky's Sensational, Fantastic, and Simply Amazing Binaural Sound Show and the Ultimate Demo Disc. In 2007, David and Norman Chesky also started an audiophile music download website called HDtracks. HDtracks allows customers to download high-resolution versions of albums in numerous formats (FLAC, AIFF). The site contains many varied artists and labels. In 2012, Crosby, Stills, and Nash announced that they would be releasing HD versions of its first three albums through HDtracks, and the company also released remastered titles from the Blue Note label, including John Coltrane's Blue Train, Eric Dolphy's Out To Lunch, Herbie Hancock's Maiden Voyage, Wayne Shorter's Speak No Evil, Horace Silver's Song for My Father and Larry Young's Unity. Other notable artists include Carole King, Janis Joplin, Michael Jackson, the Rolling Stones and Bob Dylan. In 2011, Chesky Records incorporated High Resolution Technology in their label and introduced binaural recordings. The Binaural+ masters are captured in high- resolution (24-bit/192kHz) sound using a binaural dummy head nicknamed \\"Lars\\". David Chesky collaborated with Princeton professor Edgar Y. Choueiri to begin producing binaural recordings. The purpose of the technology is to capture three-dimensional sound and imaging. In 2016, Chesky Records released the critically acclaimed jazz debut of Macy Gray, Stripped, which debuted No. 3 on the Billboard Jazz Charts. The label also released the debut album from City of the Sun, which debuted No. 12 on the Billboard Jazz Charts, would go on to garner over 17 million album streams on Spotify and peak at No. 2 on the Spotify US Viral 50. In 2018, Casey Abrams and Meiko signed with Chesky Records. Abrams' debut album for the label, Put a Spell on You, hit #5 on the Billboard Jazz Charts, and Meiko hit #23 on the Billboard Folk Charts with Playing Favorites. In 2019, Anna Nalick signed with Chesky Records and released her label debut The Blackest Crow that December.

McDonald is a professor emerita of sociology at the University of Guelph. Political career McDonald's first run for public office was during the 1981 provincial election when she was the Ontario New Democratic Party's candidate in the riding of Oriole in North York. The next year, she entered federal politics and was elected in the by-election held to fill the vacancy created by Bob Rae's departure from federal politics to take the leadership of the Ontario NDP. She defeated senior party aide Gerald Caplan on the third ballot to win the NDP nomination. In the by-election she defeated former Toronto Sun editor Peter Worthington, who was running as an independent, by almost 2,000 votes. In the 1984 federal election, she increased her margin to over 3,500 votes again defeating Worthington who, this time, was running as the official Progressive Conservative candidate. McDonald championed women's equality both inside and outside Parliament (she was the first Member of Parliament to be addressed as Ms.) She was a co-founder of the Ontario Committee on the Status of Women, 1971, which lobbied for implementation of the measures of the Report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in Canada (to which she had given a brief). As president of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, in 1980, she gave the organization‚Äôs brief on equality rights to the Joint Senate-Commons committee on the Charter of Rights. McDonald was also a notable opponent of smoking. She earned the enmity of the tobacco industry by moving a private member's bill to restrict smoking and ban tobacco advertising and sponsorships. She succeeded in getting the Non-smokers‚Äô Health Act adopted, as a private member‚Äôs bill, in 1988, the first legislation in the world to establish smoke-free work and public places. The Bill also would have banned tobacco advertising and sponsorships and regulated sales by listed tobacco products under the Hazardous Products Act.The Battle to Ban Advertising. The International Development Research Centre. , Last accessed, December 19, 2009 McDonald's bill was short-listed by a parliamentary committee for debate on the floor of the house and succeeded in winning growing support from MPs from all sides of the House of Commons as health groups lobbied in its favour. On April 22, 1987, ten days prior to the Bill's scheduled second reading vote, Health Minister Jake Epp announced the government's intention to introduce a bill that would ban tobacco advertising and sponsorships and strengthen health warnings on cigarette packages. The government also announced that it would prohibit smoking in government buildings and restrict it in other federally regulated workplaces. Despite intense lobbying by the tobacco industry, both McDonald's bill and Epp's Bill C-51, were passed by parliament and given royal assent on June 28, 1988. The lobbying around McDonald's bill is credited with giving Epp the political motivation to introduce his own legislation. McDonald's bill passed in a free vote despite the fact that every member of Cabinet present in the House voted against it. McDonald was defeated in the 1988 federal election by Liberal Dennis Mills by 1,200 votes.

Released October 21, 2003, through Victory Records. It was their first album to be released through Victory Records after their departure from Lifeforce Records. It was re-released in 2006 with a bonus DVD included. The album includes 10 tracks with a hidden song titled \\"The Man Land\\" hidden at the end of \\"The Need for Repetition\\". It is notable for being the band's only album not to be produced by Jamie King. A music video was released for the song \\"Mordecai\\"; the video starts with the first nineteen seconds of \\"Reaction\\" before transitioning into \\"Mordecai\\". Victory Records has released several double vinyl editions of the album.  Track listing  Reception The album received generally positive reviews from professional critics. Adrien Begrand of PopMatters opined in a positive review for the album, \\"The Raleigh, North Carolina, band had sliced and diced its way through multiple extreme metal subgenres, bridging the \\"math metal\\" complexity of the Dillinger Escape Plan, the godly hardcore of Converge, the furious technical death metal of Nile, and the more melodic strains of mid-'90s Swedish death metal with astonishing dexterity.\\" Kurt Morris of Allmusic commented, \\"One minute the band may be playing thrash metal and the next they're flowing into death growls and thick guitar riffs. They certainly show a mastery of the hardcore and metal styles that many bands their age can take a lot longer to understand. The metal take on things can seemingly change in a flash as lead singer Tommy Rogers fleshes out his vocals and utilizes the keyboards to create something that sounds more like it should be on a Smashing Pumpkins album\\".

The stadium, used mostly for football matches, holds 40,000, and was built in 1976. It was replaced by a new stadium in the city, seating about 40,000, that was used for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Verd√£o is owned by the Mato Grosso state government. The stadium is named after Jos√© Fragelli, who was the Mato Grosso's governor from 1970 until 1974, during the time of the stadium's construction. Verd√£o means Big Green in the Portuguese language. It was the home stadium of Mixto, Dom Bosco and Oper√°rio. History Construction started in 1973, The stadium had a planned capacity of 50,000 individuals and architectural design of Silvano Wendel, Verd√£o was the reason for harsh criticism of the administration of Fragelli. Budgeted at Cr$1,200,000.00, currency of the time, the work that was started in the Government Jose Fragelli, was finally completed in 1976, now in administration Jos√© Garcia Neto. On March 12, 1975 The team of Fluminense and selection of Cuiaba faced in the match celebrating the partial completion of works at the opportunity when the team made history Cuiab√° swinging for the first time the networks' Verd√£o. The following year, April 8, the stadium was finely finished with the presence of Flamengo and a square between the clubs in the capital, Mixto, Worker and Don Bosco, attended by over 44,000 fans. In 1976, the construction work on Verd√£o was completed. The inaugural match was played on April 8 of that year, when Mixto beat Dom Bosco 2-0. The first goal of the stadium was scored by Mixto's Pastoril. The stadium's attendance record currently stands at 44,021, set in the inaugural match. On August 9, 1980, the stadium entertained its biggest result, when Mixto beat Humait√° 14-0. Mixto's striker Elmo scored eight goals in this match. World Cup 2014 Brazil won the right to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and Cuiab√° was one of 18 cities bidding to host it. The state government planned to invest $250 million to build a new stadium in the place of Verd√£o. Cuiab√° was announced as one of the 12 host cities on May 31, 2009. The new stadium is planned to be a 40,000 all- seater and will include other projects such as a shopping mall and a convention center. To construct the new stadium will be an investment for $450 million by the state government of Mato Grosso. The playing field will have dimensions of 70 by 110 meters. The project also calls for spending $50 million for the construction of two training centers. The training fields will have dimensions of 65 by 100 meters and will be in regions close to the stadium Verd√£o. On the outside, there is a forecast of five road works for traffic flow. One of them, Avenida das Torres, is already running, while the other four are under implementation. In infrastructure, Cuiab√° offers 26 hospitals and 5,514 beds. For accommodation, the city has 46 hotels and housing capacity stands at 24,508 people. The stadium is apparently under demolition currently to make space for the new stadium. Demolition started on April 26, 2010 and is expected to be finished in less than 3 months.

J. Seymour, was a Guyanese poet, essayist, memoirist, and founding editor of the literary journal Kyk-Over-Al. Biography Born in Georgetown, British Guiana, to James Tudor Seymour, a land surveyor, and his wife Philippine, n√©e Dey, A. J. Seymour attended the Collegiate School and the Guyanese Academy before entering Queen's College, British Guiana's most prestigious boys' school, on a Government Junior Scholarship in 1928. He married Elma Editha Bryce, a teacher, on 31 July 1937. They had three daughters and three sons. =Bureaucrat and public man= In 1933, he joined the British Guiana Civil Service as an unpaid volunteer, working in the Postal and Income Tax Departments before joining the Bureau of Publicity and Information. By 1954, Seymour had worked his way to the position of Head of Government Information Services. This was a troubling time for Guiana; the People's Progressive Party (PPP) government headed by Cheddi Jagan, which was elected in 1953, had been removed from office by the colonial authorities after just four and a half months, sparking a phase of civil and political unrest that was to last for over ten years. In 1962, Seymour left the civil service and accepted the post of Information and Cultural Collaboration Officer of the Caribbean Organisation, based in Puerto Rico. He returned to Guiana in 1965, a year before Independence, and worked with the Demerara Bauxite Company (Demba), based in Mackenzie (the town was later renamed Linden) until 1971; first as Community Relations Officer, later as Public Relations Officer. In 1972 he served as Literary Co-ordinator for the first Caribbean Festival of Arts (Carifesta), held in Guyana; in 1973 he rejoined the civil service as Deputy Chairman of the Department of Culture and Director of Creative Writing. He retired in 1979. Over the nearly fifty years of his career, Seymour also held senior positions in a number of cultural institutions; among others, he was Honorary Secretary of the British Guiana Union of Cultural Clubs (1943‚Äì50), Deputy Chairman of the Guyana National Trust (1974‚Äì75), President of the British Guiana Music Festival Committee, and President of the International P.E.N. Club's British Guiana Centre. =Editor and publisher= In 1945, Seymour founded Kyk-Over-Al (sometimes spelled Kykoveral), a literary journal named for an early Dutch fort on the Essequibo River. Over a 16-year period until 1961 he published 28 issues of this pioneering magazine, including some of the earliest work of notable writers such as Wilson Harris and Martin Carter. During this time he also edited and published An Anthology of Guianese Poetry (1954); The Kyk-Over-Al Anthology of West Indian Poetry (1952; revised ed. 1958); and the Miniature Poets Series (1951‚Äì53) of pamphlets, which included work by Carter, Harris, Ivan Van Sertima, Trinidadian Harold Telemaque, Barbadian Frank Collymore, and Jamaican Philip Sherlock. Later anthologies include My Lovely Native Land: An Anthology of Guyana (Longman, 1971), co-edited with Elma Seymour, New Writing in the Caribbean (Georgetown: National History and Arts Council, published after the Caribbean Festival of Arts in Guyana in 1972)Bruce King (ed.), West Indian Literature, Macmillan, 1979, p. 230. and A Treasury of Guyanese Poetry (1980). Starting in 1976, Seymour also wrote five volumes of autobiography. In 1984, with the help of poet and novelist Ian McDonald, Seymour revived Kyk-Over-Al. =Poet= In 1936, Seymour began writing poems. By 1937 he had completed his first collection, Verse; his second, More Poems, followed in 1940. The title poem of Over Guiana, Clouds (1944) was a landmark in the development of Seymour's poetic style. Suns In My Blood (1945) contained at least three poems that have come to be considered classics: \\"Sun Is a Shapely Fire\\", \\"There Runs a Dream\\", and \\"The Legend of Kaieteur\\" (this last poem was later set to music by the Guyanese composer Philip Pilgrim). Seymour's later major collections include Leaves from the Tree (1951), Selected Poems (1965), Patterns (1970), My Lovely Native Land (1971) and Selected Poems (1983). A tribute volume called AJS at 70 (1984), edited by Ian McDonald, contained a selection of 15 poems under the title \\"The Essential Seymour\\", chosen by Seymour himself. Seymour died on 25 December 1989, a few weeks shy of his 76th birthday. In 2000, Seymour's Collected Poems, 1937-1989 was published, edited by Ian McDonald and Jacqueline de Weever. Legacy Though a handful of Seymour's poems continue to be well known in Guyana, outside his home country his writing has fallen into obscurity, especially by comparison with that of his friend and colleague Martin Carter. However, Seymour continues to be remembered across the Caribbean for his work as editor of Kyk-Over-Al, in which role he acted as a sort of eminence grise of West Indian letters. He tirelessly encouraged fellow writers, published their work where and when he could, wrote about them in his critical essays, and publicised them in lecture tours, which in later years took him across the Caribbean and to the United States, Brazil, and Germany, among other countries. At the 2014 NGC Bocas Lit Fest tribute was paid to Seymour to mark the centenary of his birth, with readings from his work by Guyanese writers and others.Wesley Gibbings, \\"Bocas Lit Fest pays tribute to AJ Seymour\\", Guardian Media, 12 May 2014.

It is used as a carbohydrate food reserve in the same way that chrysolaminarin is used by phytoplankton, especially in diatoms. It is created by photosynthesis and is made up of Œ≤(1‚Üí3)-glucan with Œ≤(1‚Üí6)-branches. It is a linear polysaccharide, with a Œ≤(1‚Üí3):Œ≤(1‚Üí6) ratio of 3:1. Its hydrolysis is catalyzed by enzymes such as laminarinase (EC 3.2.1.6) that breaks the Œ≤(1‚Üí3) bonds. It has been suggested that the annual production of algae laminarin amounts to 12 ¬± 8 gigatons, i.e., about three times the annual atmospheric CO2 increase by fossil fuel burning, that its concentration is driven by light variability and that it contributes substantially to the carbon export from surface waters, as it may account for up to half of organic carbon in sinking diatom-containing particles.Becker S, Tebben J, Coffinet, S, Wiltshire K, Hvitfeldt Iversen M, Harder, T, Hinrichs K-U, Hehemann, J-H (2020).

The center, a field operating agency for Air Combat Command, is the focal point for integrating mission systems, business systems, commercial information technology products and other networks into the Air Force Network (AFNet). AFNIC's strategic-level network integration, architecture/standards, engineering and simulation services enable major commands, functional communities, and program offices to successfully and efficiently design, develop and deploy \\"networthy\\" capabilities for the Air Force. As part of its integration mission, AFNIC also leads the Air Force's No. 1 cyber priority, Air Force Network Migration. This project consolidates the service's previous collection of standalone, unit- specific architectures into a single, centrally managed enterprise network that enhances security, reduces costs and improves standardization. Major Services Air Force Network Integration: AFNIC guides customers through all stages of product development, leading to optimally performing capabilities primed for smooth integration onto the Air Force Network. As part of this process, a robust, holistic assessment of security, interoperability, supportability, sustainability, usability, policy compliance, and network usage is conducted. These criteria are evaluated and validated during analysis and end-to-end testing, allowing for issues to be identified and resolved early which improves security and interoperability, facilitates reciprocity, and reduces the time needed for cross-component fielding of information technology. Network Standards, Architectures and Engineering: AFNIC's network experts design and document future Air Force Network architecture plans which serve as a blueprint to standardize network capabilities and integrate them onto the AFNet. AFNIC engineers provide technical expertise to integrate networks as well as produce AFNet compliant network designs. People Approximately 130 military, civilian and contractor cyber professionals are assigned to perform the AFNIC mission. AFNIC Personnel working with the Simulator Training Exercise (SIMTEX) range Organization AFNIC is composed of two directorates: Integration Services (NI): Designs and documents future AFNet infrastructure plans and standardizes network service capabilities. When a new system needs to be integrated onto the AFNet, NI reviews the system's architecture to identify and, if necessary, resolves any integration or compatibility issues between the programs and the network. Includes Deliberate and Strategic planning, Service Management, and Architecture Development Divisions as well as the Air Force Cross Domain Support Office. Technical Services (NT): Provides technical network consulting to all Air Force organizations and some COCOMS to help them integrate their systems and products to the AFNet. Includes Service Operations, System Engineering, and Validation Environments Divisions. History AFNIC traces its history back to the Army Airways Communications System (AACS), which was organized on 15 November 1938 in the Directorate of Communications of the U.S. Army Air Corps. The official lineage of the AACS as a separate unit, began on 13 April 1943 with the constitution of the AACS Wing. The wing was soon reassigned directly to HQ Army Air Forces, on 14 July 1943. Major command status was reached with the addition of Headquarters (HQ) to the AACS name on 26 April 1944. On 13 March 1946, AACS was redesignated Air Communications Service (ACS) and reassigned to the Air Transport Command. The ACS was then redesignated the Airways and Air Communications Service (AACS) on 11 September 1946, and subsequently reassigned to the Military Air Transport Service on 1 June 1948. Airways and Air Communications Service became an Air Force major command again on 1 July 1961, and was simultaneously redesignated Air Force Communications Service (AFCS). AFCS was redesignated Air Force Communications Command (AFCC) on 15 November 1979. AFCC became a field operating agency on 1 July 1991, reporting to Headquarters United States Air Force. Around this time, it lost all the communications units that had been gathered under it for many years. These units went to the groups or wings they had worked for. It was redesignated Air Force Command, Control, Communications, and Computer Agency (AFC4A) on 28 May 1993; AFC4A was redesignated the Air Force Communications Agency (AFCA) on 13 June 1996 and on 1 April 1997 was assigned to the Air Force Communications and Information Center. AFCA was reassigned to HQ United States Air Force on 1 October 2000. AFCA was reassigned to HQ Air Force Space Command, the Air Force's designated lead for cyber, on 4 May 2009, and redesignated the Air Force Network Integration Center on 15 July 2009. AFNIC works closely with Twenty-Fourth Air Force on cyber issues. In 2012 it was announced that AFNIC would be restructured, divesting some of its cyber mission to Air Force Space Command.Lead cyberspace tasks headed to Space Command, 15 May 2012, Air Force Times Current organize, train and equip staff functions within AFNIC, such as records, forms, publications, cyber training programs, cyber requirements support, plans, and maintenance policy, transferred to the AFSPC Cyberspace Support Squadron (CYSS), which stood up at Scott AFB.AFNIC cyberspace mission transfers to AF Space Command, 15 May 2012 Other functions transferred to the new 92d Information Operations Squadron and 38th Cyberspace Readiness Squadron.

He was the son-in-law of the previous Sultan, Omar Ali Saifuddin II. Background He was the son of Pengiran Shahbandar Pengiran Anak Abdul Wahab and grandson of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin I . He was also the brother in law of Sultan Hashim Jalilul Alam Aqamaddin. His Highness was well respected as he brought peace and order to the country. Marriage He married Pengiran Anak Zubaidah, the daughter of Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin II, thus making him the latter's son-in-law. He married Pengiran Anak Fatima as first wife, the daughter of Sultan Muhammad Khanzul Alam. They had issue a son, Pengiran Muda Prince Shahabuddin. ( The prince ran away to North Borneo for the safety purpose) Reign Abdul Momin succeeded his father-in-law Omar Ali Saifuddin II as sultan upon the latter's death, having previously served as regent for him during his ill health. During Abdul Momin's reign, the teachings of Islam were encouraged and he also sent some Ulama to the Holy City of Makkah. Seizure of territories by foreign powers During his reign, many territories were surrendered to James Brooke of Sarawak; in 1855, seven districts stretching from Samarahan to Rajang were surrendered to James Brooke in the signing of a treaty. On 26 November 1856, the British signed a treaty with Sultan Abdul Momin to reconfirm the Treaty of Friendship and Commerce signed in 1847. In 1861, Abdul Momin ceded more territories to James Brooke. At the same time, between 1865 and 1878, three foreign groups encroached into North Borneo (Sabah). In 1865, Charles Lee Moses, an American Consul General, signed a treaty with Sultan Abdul Momin and obtained twenty one districts. Later, Moses transferred his rights to the lease to Joseph Wilfred Torrey who sold it to Gustavus Baron von Overbeck. In 1881, the British government granted the British North Borneo Company a royal charter. William Hood Treacher was appointed the first British Governor of North Borneo.  Charles Brooke in Sarawak  He was the nephew of James Brooke. He inherited the territory that extended from Tanjong Datu in the South to Tanjong Kedurong, north of Bintulu River. When he was the Tuan Muda of Sarawak, he pressured Sultan Abdul Momin to give up Baram River. The Sultan refused to gave up Baram River and asked the British government to stop Charles Brooke. Baram was the well from which Brunei people drink water. Charles Brooke pressured the Sultan by not giving parts of the annual payment. Pope Hennesy, the British Consul-General of Labuan informed the British government that Charles Brooke planned to fight the Sultan to get Baram and Brunei itself. The British government banned Charles Brooke from taking any territory for next ten years. However in 1874, The Kayan of Baram rebelled against Brunei's oppressive rule. Charles Brooke used this rebellion as an excuse to seize Baram from Brunei. In 1882, Peter Leys, the British Consul- General of Labuan also forced Sultan Abdul Momin to lease Baram to Sarawak. The Sultan realized that further resistance was useless, so he agreed to lease Baram. In return, the Sultan received $3000 annually, $2000 was paid to Pengiran Temenggong Anak Hashim and two other Pengirans. In 1884, Pengiran Temenggong ceded Terusan and Limbang to Sarawak. However, these cessions were not legally valid because as they did not have the Sultan's seal. Declaration of Amanat Realising that Brunei would become extinct, Abdul Momin declared the Amanat, an agreement between the Sultan, Wazirs, Manteris, and holders of Tulin rights not to cede or lease any remaining territories to the foreign powers. In the years that followed, many Brunei territories continued to be taken, including Limbang. Also, at that time, Brunei did not have the military strength to enforce the Amanat.

It may also include swaying of the rest of the body and picking up the front legs. Some horses exhibit non-stereotypical weaving, and instead engage in variations on this behavior . Causes Ultimately, the domestication of horses is considered to be the cause of stable vices such as weaving . There are no reports of wild horses displaying weaving behaviour, mainly because these horses are in their natural state, i.e. they are not confined or on a schedule. Domesticated horses are often housed in stalls (typically 8x8 or 12x12) at night, and are allowed turnout (i.e. time outside) during the day. Horses that are housed in solitary confinement from other horses, or those that do not get daily turnout, or inadequate turnout, are more at risk for developing stable vices such as weaving . Horses often perform this vice due to stress . Horses tend to weave near the door of their stall, possibly because they desire to leave the stall to move around. Horses also sometimes weave near a window to the aisle or the exterior of the stable, which would provide visual stimulation. Stress during critical periods such as weaning may also contribute to the development of stables vices . However, some horses that have developed the habit will also weave while turned out, signifying that the problem is not solely one of confinement. Many equestrians believe weaving is a learned habit. However, some experts theorize that weaving could more likely develop in horses with a genetic predisposition to it . Thus, there is a debate over whether weaving is a learned behavior that horses pick up by observing another horse who weaves, or if it is an inborn tendency that develops under a certain set of environmental conditions. These two arguments fail to take into account the fact that most behaviours can be both genetically and environmentally influenced. It is possible that both sides are correct to some extent. Horses that exhibit non-stereotypical weaving do not necessarily begin after watching another horse weaving (stereotypical or non-stereotypical), suggesting that horses can begin weaving without learning it from another horse . Some people claim that it is usually safe to allow other horses to see a weaver, unless it is known that the horse may be genetically predisposed (their sire or dam was a weaver) . Others feel it is caused by environmental factors, and that other horses in the same setting will pick up the behavior once a single horse starts. However, this may be due to all horses experiencing similar stresses, and thus engaging in similar behavior. Weaving may also be caused by anticipation of predictable events such as feeding or turnout, as the behavior has been observed to increase prior to these events . Negative effects Weaving is generally not a very damaging vice over short periods of time, but horses that are consistent weavers may show abnormal hoof wear, and stress on their joints (which can cause lameness). Damage to the stall floor may also occur. The overall value of a horse is not necessarily diminished by its weaving, but the underlying cause of stress or boredom that is causing the behavior should be investigated and rectified to ensure the horse's well-being. Weaving is also linked to weight loss, uneven muscle development, and performance problems . Management Providing a large turnout area, and free-choice hay reduces stress by mimicking a horses natural environment, and therefore reduces risk of weaving behaviour. Like most vices, weaving is a very difficult habit to break, and may not disappear even after the original problem has been resolved. However, there are several ways to manage a weaver and reduce its stress: * Allow a weaver to see other horses, even if he is stalled separately. * Provide a companion for the horse, if possible. Some options include goats, cats, or chickens. * Provide visual stimulation. In a stall, an open window often helps the situation. * Keep the horse occupied when stalled. For example, provide a good quality continuous hay or a toy. * Allow the horse to spend more time outside of its stall. This mimics a horses natural environment and should reduce stress levels. * Hanging a mirror in a stall often helps weaving, because the horse believes there is a nearby horse. This trick is often very effective, and recent studies in the UK have demonstrated that it can reduce weaving by 97% . Note that the mirror should be made from stainless steel to minimize safety concerns. * Feed a high quality, high fiber hay and/or grain to reduce feeding frustration. Consistent feeding times and quality is important, and try to find ways to increase eating time (hay nets) . *Try not to feed wean-age horses concentrated feed (grain), as this can increase stress levels and frustration . * Alter stall design if horse weaves over door. 'V'-shaped anti-weaving bars prevent weaving. This method is strictly a prevention, and may actually increase the horses frustration . * Increasing horses exercise, especially if it has limited turnout time during the day. *Pay particular attention to lowering levels of stress during critical periods in a horses life, especially during weaning. Gradual weaning techniques have been shown to reduce the risk of developing stable vices .

The original High School of Glasgow was founded as the choir school of Glasgow Cathedral in around 1124, and is the oldest school in Scotland, and the twelfth oldest in the United Kingdom. On its closure as a selective grammar school by Glasgow City Corporation in 1976, it immediately continued as a co-educational independent school as a result of fundraising activity by its Former Pupil Club and via a merge by the Club with Drewsteignton School. The school maintains a relationship with the Cathedral, where it holds an annual service of commemoration and thanksgiving in September. It counts two British Prime Ministers, two Lords President and the founder of the University of Aberdeen among its alumni. It is a selective school, meaning prospective pupils must sit an entrance test to gain admission. In 2009 and 2017, The Times placed it as the top independent school in Scotland for SQA results. The rector of the school is John O'Neill. History High School For Girls, Garnethill, Glasgow The original school was founded as the Choir School of Glasgow Cathedral in around 1124, and later became known as Glasgow Grammar School. It was housed in Greyfriar's Wynd until 1782, when it moved to new purpose-built accommodation in George Street, but it moved again in 1821 to new premises between John Street and Montrose Street. The name was changed in 1834 to The High School of Glasgow, and in 1872 it was transferred to the management of the Glasgow School Board. In 1878, the school moved into the former premises of the Glasgow Academy on Elmbank Street, when the latter moved to its new home in Kelvinbridge in the West End of the city. The Glasgow High School for Girls was founded in 1894 and housed variously in Garnethill and Kelvindale.Kelvindale history and schooling In 1976, the regional council closed the Boy's High School, while the Girls' High School began admitting boys and was renamed as Cleveden Secondary School. The proposed closure was met with anger from former pupils and, the day after the closure of the Boys' High School, the new, independent, co-educational high school was created, following a merger involving the former pupils' association, the Glasgow High School Club, and Drewsteignton School in Bearsden, which effectively became the new high school. In 1983 an arts and science extension was opened. Today Glasgow Story and the school's motto The new, purpose-built senior school (Transitus to S6) is in Old Anniesland, owned by the Glasgow High School Club (below). There have been multiple extensions to these buildings, including the two-storey science block. The junior school (kindergarten to P6) occupies the site of the former Drewsteignton School, on Ledcameroch Road in Old Bearsden. The headmistress of the junior school is Heather Fuller Houses Pupils at the school are divided into the following Houses: *Bannerman, for Sir Henry Campbell- Bannerman. (Red) *Clyde, for Lord Clyde. (Blue) *Law, for Bonar Law. (Green) *Moore, for Sir John Moore. (Yellow) The school operates a house competition, and pupils may earn points for their house through excellence in areas such as sports, music, academia. The current holder of the overall house championship is Bannerman House. The Junior School Houses take their names from British lifeboat stations: Broughtyferry (red), Campbelltown (blue), Lizard (green) and Longhope (yellow). Glasgow High School Club The Glasgow High School Club is the former pupil club of the high school and its predecessor schools, the High School for Boys, the Girls' High School and Drewsteignton School. The club is a limited company, run by a committee and a president, who is elected annually. The president is Craig Macdonald, and the past president is Ronnie Gourley. The honorary president is The Lord Macfarlane of Bearsden, and the Rector of the School, John O'Neill, is an ex officio member. The rest of the committee comprises three honorary vice presidents, senior vice president, junior vice president, secretary, treasurer, house convenor, seven ordinary members, GHK Rugby president, triathlon representative, president of the ladies' section and president of ladies' hockey. The club owns Old Anniesland, the site on which the school now stands, and is based in the pavilion. The club runs all the facilities at Old Anniesland, including the Jimmie Ireland Stand but excluding the school. Use of the club's facilities is restricted to members. The club runs a number of sports teams, although the former Glasgow High Kelvinside (GHK) rugby club merged in 1997 with rivals Glasgow Academicals FC to form Glasgow Hawks. The name was intended as an acronym of High, Accies, West (of Scotland) and Kelvinside, however West of Scotland declined the invitation to merge into the new team and continue to play separately from their ground in Milngavie. The friendly rivalry with the Glasgow Accies, based at neighbouring New Anniesland, inspired the name of the Anniesland Trophy, an annual golf competition between the clubs. The club also has an active London branch, The London Club, which hosts a dinner every March at the Caledonian Club and a lunch in early October for recent leavers moving to study in London.

The engagement was part of the English crown's campaign against the forces of Gerald Fitzgerald, 15th Earl of Desmond during the Second Desmond Rebellion. The castle was held by rebel troops in the service of Desmond and some Catholic troops from continental Europe.  Background  Carrigafoyle Castle today (west wall recently reconstructed to the height of the first floor for safety reasons) Carrigafoyle Castle - built by Conor Liath O'Connor- Kerry in the 1490s and considered one of the strongest of Irish fortresses - was a large tower house, of the type particularly common across the north of the province of Munster. It stood on a rock in a small bay off the Shannon estuary, and its name is an anglicisation of the Irish, Carraig an Phoill (\\"rock of the hole\\"). The castle was known as The guardian of the Shannon because of its strategic command of the shipping lanes that supplied the trading city of Limerick, some 20 miles (32 km) upriver. The bay at Carrigafoyle was shielded from the estuary on the northern side by a wooded island; within the bay the castle-rock was defended on the west and south sides by a double defensive wall; the inner wall enclosed a bawn, and surrounding this was a moat covered on three sides (the east lay open) by the outer wall, where a smaller tower stood. The tower-keep itself was 86 ft high, and the precipitous sides of the castle-rock were layered with bricks and mortar. At high tide the walled landing within the moat was capable of accommodating a ship of 100 tons displacement.  Siege  During the rebellion the castle was held by 50 Irish, along with 16 Spanish soldiers who had landed at Smerwick harbour the previous year in the 1579 Papal invasion; there were also women and children present. Months earlier an Italian engineer, Captain Julian, had set about perfecting the castle's defences under the direction of Desmond's countess, Eleanor. By the time of the siege she had retired to her husband's company - some forty miles (64 km) distant, at Castleisland - while Julian was still at his task. The English commander, Sir William Pelham, marched through Munster in the company of Sir George Carew and assumed command of an additional 600 troops. He was supported by a fleet of 3 three-masted ships under the command of Sir William Winter. It was the largest army ever seen in the west of Ireland. On arriving at Carrigafoyle the English camped to the south-west of the castle. The fleet anchored in the estuary beyond the bay and supplied Pelham with 3 demi-cannon and a culverin (a huge naval gun with small projectiles) manned by naval gunners. The ordnance was ranged along a low wall running north, parallel to the outer wall at a distance of 100 yards, and at the northern point of this wall a company of foot with lances was stationed. The bombardment of the castle was carried out over two days, six hours each day. The demi-cannon could be effective against stone, but only if allowed to fire unhindered - in the event no hindrance was given. In addition Winter's ships fired their stern cannon against the seaward wall of the castle. On the first day (Palm Sunday) Pelham ordered a party of troops to cross to the sea-wall, where they were pinned down by gunfire and had boulders hurled at them from the battlements. The troops threw up assault ladders, which the Spanish halberdiers pushed away. The Earl of Ormond described seeing the sea-channel fill with wreckage as the sides of the castle-rock became slippery with blood. Pelham was hit by a ricochet and jeered at by the defenders, but there was no pause in the bombardment. On the second day, Pelham was reinforced with troops from Winter's ships. The final assault, led by Captains Humfrey Mackworth and John Zouche, was concentrated on the part of the tower furthest from the cannon, where the defenders were holding out. The tower cracked under the impact of 2 or 3 shot, and the great west wall collapsed on its foundations, crushing many within. The survivors fled through the shallow waters, but most were shot or put to the sword; the rest (including one woman) were brought back to camp and hanged from trees. Captain Julian was hanged three days later.  Consequences  The strategic significance of the siege is shown in the swiftness with which other Desmond strongholds fell once news of the destruction had spread. The castle at Askeaton was abandoned before the guns (its Spanish defenders blowing up the walls), and the garrisons at Newcastle West, Balliloghan, Rathkeale, and Ballyduff slipped away soon after. The rebels then engaged in guerrilla warfare, and the crown only prevailed against them in 1583, when the Earl of Desmond was killed at Glenageenty in the Slieve Mish mountains near Tralee. Such was the damage to Carrigafoyle Castle that it was never repaired. Its ruins still stand, including the outer defences and moat, and the effect of the bombardment is clear to see.

He quickly moved to episodic television. Over his 30-year career in television he directed both series and telefilms. Series that he directed several episodes for include The Man from U.N.C.L.E., The Girl from U.N.C.L.E., The Name of the Game, Ironside, Alias Smith and Jones, Police Story, Police Woman, and The Feather and Father Gang. =Film career= Shear's first made-for-theaters feature was the 1968 counter culture film Wild in the Streets. He later directed theatrical films in various genres such as The Todd Killings in 1971 (based on the serial killer Charles Schmid), the blaxploitation film Across 110th Street in 1972, and the western The Deadly Trackers in 1973. While well received, these features met with only fair box office and Shear returned to work exclusively in television.

Hokey pokey is the New Zealand term for honeycomb toffee.\\"Hokey Pokey\\", Recipe, Evening Post, 1927 The original recipe until around 1980 consisted of solid toffee, but in a marketing change Tip-Top decided to use small balls of honeycomb toffee instead.

Peterman Company. He grew up in West Nyack, New York as the son of a banker and secretary. He is known for founding the J. Peterman Company after finding a cowboy duster on a business trip. Peterman was also a minor-league baseball player, Kentucky rancher, and an author. Early life  Peterman was the third of four children born to Charles and Sally Peterman. He had two brothers and a sister. Charles Peterman became a loan officer and, later, the assistant vice president of the Irving Trust Co. after working his way up from the mailroom. John Peterman grew up in Van Houten Fields, an agrarian commune in West Nyack, New York. Those who were part of the community built their own houses and grew a portion of their own food. Peterman learned to garden, tend chickens, and participate in other physical labor. His mother worked as an administrative assistant after her children started school. As a high schooler, Peterman attended Clarkstown High School and participated in basketball, baseball, and football. He was recognized in the local newspaper for his performance in all three sports. In baseball, he played second base and was voted All-P.S.A.L Baseball first team selection as a second basemen. He graduated from Clarkstown High School in 1960. Education and baseball career Peterman graduated from the College of the Holy Cross, in Worcester, Massachusetts in 1963 with a Bachelor of Science in economics. He played third base on the Holy Cross baseball teams that went to the College World Series in 1962 and 1963. As a junior in 1962, he had a .362 batting average and as a senior in 1963, he had a .291 batting average and led his team with 17 runs batted in. He also played minor-league baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates organization for three years as a second baseman. In 1963, Peterman had a one-day tryout with the New York Yankees at Yankee Stadium where he played next to Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, and Tony Kubek, but did not sign with the team. His baseball career ended in his early 20s after a leg injury. Business career =Sales= Peterman had a career in sales for 20 years after his baseball career ended. He worked as a regional sales manager in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Alabama for General Foods and Castle & Cooke. During his time in sales, Peterman sold dog food, cereal, pineapple, tuna fish, and inspirational tapes. In 1981, he was managing fertilizer accounts but was dismissed. =Corporate consultant= Peterman became a corporate consultant after deciding ‚Äúthat was the first and last time I was going to be fired.‚Äù As a corporate specialty-foods sales consultant, he helped people make deals with other companies, and it allowed him to travel. During a meeting to help a client find an advertising company, Peterman met Donald Staley and they began to work closely together. They agreed to collaborate on any entrepreneurial ideas they envisioned, which led to several businesses. =Entrepreneur= Together, Peterman and Staley started a mail-order company to heal sick houseplants as well as a manufacturing business making beer cheese; both were successful. The beer cheese business was originally Hall's Beer Cheese and Peterman bought half the company. While he was selling beer cheese, he found a horseman's duster that would propel him into the retail business. The beer cheese was being sold downstairs and the retail business was upstairs until Hall's was eventually sold. = J. Peterman Company = In 1986, Peterman was on a business trip in Denver, CO and decided to explore Wyoming. He went to Jackson Hole, WY and bought a horseman's duster because he liked it. After wearing it consistently, he and his friend Staley decided to sell more of the coats with an ad in The New Yorker. The ad sold about 70 coats and the J. Peterman Company was created. In the fall of 1988, the company's first catalog was published with black and white drawings and literary copy style. Color illustrations were introduced to the catalogue in 1989. Peterman found unique items to sell in the catalog and Staley wrote the product descriptions. Bob Hagel was the first J. Peterman Co. illustrator and art director. He made the decision to draw and paint the clothes from the catalog without bodies, so they appeared like \\"well-traveled ghosts.\\" The catalogue drew the attention of celebrities like Oprah Winfrey, Clint Eastwood, and Tom Hanks. The company continued to grow and in 1995, the TV show Seinfeld debuted J. Peterman as a character played by John O'Hurley. The J. Peterman Co. also became well known for selling movie replicas of the \\"Heart of The Ocean\\" necklace from the 1997 film Titanic. The company sold $1 million worth of necklace replicas along with other costume and prop replicas. In 1999, the J. Peterman Co. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The company was unable to sustain its rapid growth and was bought out by Paul Harris Stores. However, in 2000, Paul Harris Stores went bankrupt and Peterman was able to buy back his namesake brand. The J. Peterman Company catalogue has been relaunched and Tim Peterman, John Peterman's son, was the CEO of J. Peterman Company until 2014. The president of the J. Peterman Company, as of 2018, is Kyle Foster. The company has developed \\"Peterman's Eye,\\" a social networking site, and an online catalogue that offers mail-order inventory as well as unique antiques.  Personal life  Peterman has been married to his wife, Audrey (n√©e Aramini, born to Ann and Albert Aramini), for about 54 years. They have four children: Robyn, Sean, Timothy, and Mathew. Peterman's daughter Robyn Peterman Zahn, a popular writer and former actress, is married to the actor Steve Zahn. They have two children, Henry James Zahn and Audrey Clair Zahn. Sean was a cattle and grain farmer until he was tragically killed July 23, 2015 in a farming accident in Lexington, KY. Peterman's son, Tim Peterman, was the CEO of J. Peterman Company from 2008 until 2014, and helped build the company's web presence. Around 2014, Matt Peterman started working at the J. Peterman Company as the Creative Director after spending time in Los Angeles, CA in the film business. Peterman owns a cabin on a 550-acre parcel of land in Lexington, KY that was formerly farmed by his son Sean. In 2001, John Peterman presented a lecture titled ‚ÄúThe Painful but Essential Art of Failing‚Äù to his alma mater, College of the Holy Cross. Peterman spoke to the pre-business program at the invitation of Nancy Baldiga, the pre-business advisor and associate professor of economics. Works After the J. Peterman Company filed for bankruptcy and was bought by Paul Harris Stores, Peterman wrote a book, Peterman Rides Again, a 2000 memoir that explores his life from his early baseball career to finding products for the catalog while traveling. It also chronicles the rise and fall of the J. Peterman Company and Peterman's ‚Äúhard-won lessons in entrepreneurship.‚Äù The book was published November 6, 2000 and has 225 pages. * References External links * The J Peterman Company * Peterman's Eye - A daily brief for curious minds * The Return of J.

It took less than 60 seconds to hit Galt√ºr. At high and traveling at , this powder avalanche hit with great force, overturning cars, ruining buildings and burying 57 people. By the time rescue crews managed to arrive, 31 people ‚Äì locals and tourists ‚Äì had died. This avalanche was considered the worst Alpine avalanche in 40 years. Three major weather systems originating from the Atlantic accounted for large snowfalls totaling around four meters in the area. Freeze-thaw conditions created a weak layer on top of an existing snow pack; further snow was then deposited on top. This, coupled with high wind speeds, created large snow drifts and caused roughly 170,000 tons of snow to be deposited.  Avalanche zones  Like most populated regions of the Alps, Galt√ºr was hazard-zoned according to the perceived risk into red, yellow, and green areas. Red zones are considered highly vulnerable to avalanches; no development is permitted in these areas. Yellow zones pose a moderate risk to avalanches; development is allowed but structures must be reinforced to resist avalanches. Green zones are considered avalanche safe; development is permitted with no reinforcement required. Galt√ºr fitted into this last zone, and because of this, the resort was not well prepared for an avalanche.  The cause  In January 1999, a series of storms occurred bringing with them of fine snow forming a huge snow pack on the mountains above Galt√ºr. Later that month a melt-crust developed‚Äîthe upper layers melting during the day and refreezing at night. The cause of the avalanches puzzled scientists for a long time. Although the area was prone to avalanches, never before had they occurred on such a scale as this, reaching the village. A complex sequence of events led to the event. On 20 January, an Atlantic storm was forming . Turbulent warm air from the tropics headed north, cooled, and swung back towards Europe. This initiated a series of storms. Combined with cold Arctic air coming from the north, there was a very dry, light snowfall exceeding . A massive snow pack formed on the mountains above Galt√ºr. Northwest winds piled the snow to increasing depths. At Galt√ºr, the snow bonded with ice and hence lasted longer than usual. The resulting powder avalanche contained a central layer of which scientists were unaware. Known as the saltation layer, it was primarily responsible for the destruction of buildings. As new snow fell, the melt-crust became unstable until, on 23 February at 3:59 pm, it failed and caused an enormously powerful powder avalanche to crash down the mountainside, picking up more and more snow as it went. There was also 120 km//hour winds which caused the saltation layer of snow to move causing this disaster.  Green Zone  As in the region, Galt√ºr is risk-zoned for safety from avalanches; but it was the supposedly safe, green zone that was the worst hit. The Austrian government asked for assistance and thousands of people were airlifted out, using helicopters from both Europe and the USA. However, six locals and twenty-five tourists perished in the avalanches.  Emergency response  United States Army UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter crew preparing to evacuate stranded tourists in Galt√ºr, Austria, on 25 February 1999 Soon after the avalanche rescuers began to look for survivors; in 24 hours the rescuers saved 26 people. A rescue dog, Heiko, amply proved the value dogs have in avalanche rescue, saving many lives, as did a second dog, a Labrador-Alsatian cross named Jack, who was buried under snow for 24 hours. The day after the avalanche, 31 people were confirmed dead. Galt√ºr and several neighboring communities needed supplies and evacuation. Several countries contributed aircraft: To support the Austrian Bell 212, Bell 204 and Alouette III helicopters, Germany sent UH-1D and CH-53G, the German border protection (Bundesgrenzschutz) Super Pumas, the U.S. Army 10 UH-60 Black Hawks, and the Swiss and French air forces together six Super Puma/Cougar helicopters. In addition to them, the Austrian Ministry of the Interior supplied six helicopters, private companies nine, and the √ñAMTC used two EC 135 rescue helicopters to transport injured patients. In 935 hours of flight, 18,406 persons and 271 tons of supplies were transported. The crews flew, in order not to create an additional avalanche risk, below the tree line, and flew on the right side of the valley to separate traffic. The Austrian helicopters transported the evacuated to the army barracks at Landeck, while the other air crews flew the evacuated to a section of the Inn valley highway.  Aftermath  Avalanche protection wall built after the avalanche of 1999 Outraged families demanded to know why the avalanche penetrated the supposedly safe and devastated Galt√ºr. However, hazard zoning is based nearly entirely on the historical record, and there was no evidence of avalanches traveling so far on this track in the past. Since this disaster there have been renewed efforts to improve avalanche knowledge and forecasting so that hazard zones can be accurately predicted. This is particularly important if land use or climate changes render past information less useful. Response has included the extension of the hazard zones, with steel fences constructed on all mountainsides above the village to break up the areas where unstable snow packs can form, creating smaller shelves overall that reduce the size and scale of any future avalanches. A avalanche dam directly protects the village. There has been rezoning, so the former Green zone is now of a higher risk zone.

Early life Gary Stretch was born in 1965 and brought up in the Haresfinch area of St Helens, Lancashire. His father was a plumber. He attended the town's Cowley High School. Boxing A southpaw fighter, Stretch boxed most of his career as a light-middleweight, rising to become British champion in that division. Stretch won the WBC International Light Middleweight title, beating Ramon Angel Alegre at the London Arena on 14 February 1990, the fight billed as Valentine's Day Massacre. Stretch stopped the tough Argentine in the 6th round of a very one sided contest. Stretch relinquished the title due to a management dispute with Frank Warren and subsequently sat out his contract. Stretch's return to the ring came in 1991 when he challenged Chris Eubank for the WBO world middleweight championship in London, in a fight billed as \\"Beauty V the Best\\". Stretch suffered a cut behind the ear in the first round and was shaken by an uppercut in the third. Eubank visited the canvas twice in the fight without a count, in the second and third rounds, and was cut badly in the fourth round by a straight left hand from Stretch. The doctor was called at the end of round 5 to look at Eubank (the cut later needed several stitches), advising the referee to stop the fight. The referee gave the Eubank corner the go ahead for 'one more round'. In the sixth round Stretch had a point deducted for pushing Eubank onto the canvas; Stretch was shaken by a right hand from Eubank and subsequently took a standing eight count. Stretch was then pushed through the ropes. The fight was stopped in Eubank's favor, a stoppage that was controversial. Stretch was through the ropes, struggling to regain his feet when the referee stepped in. All three judges had Stretch ahead on the scorecard at the time of the stoppage. Stretch fought only once more after his bout with Eubank before retiring with a career record of 29 wins 1 loss and 1 NC (an accidental clash of heads causing Stretch to be cut on the forehead). Modelling During his time as a boxer, Stretch also worked as a model. His clients included Calvin Klein and Versace. Acting Stretch was cast as Cleitus in a supporting role, opposite Sir Anthony Hopkins, Colin Farrell and Angelina Jolie in Oliver Stone's 2004 film Alexander. Stone went on to cast Stretch again in World Trade Center as a paramedic, and in Savages. In 2004, Stretch was cast as psychopathic gangster Sonny in Shane Meadows' gritty cult thriller Dead Man's Shoes (2004), for which Stretch received a BIFA nomination alongside fellow English actor Paddy Considine. Stretch also starred in the UK film Freebird in 2008, directed by Jon Ivay. With Stretch appearing alongside Phil Daniels and Geoff Bell, the film followed three bikers across a drug- fueled ride in the Welsh countryside. This was reviewed in Empire magazine as \\"Empire reviewThe turgid plot is not helped by the undefined characters, the fact that the nominal lead (Gary Stretch) shows all the emotional span of a toaster, and beautiful scenery shots spoiled by the preposterous mess of coincidence.\\" In 2016 Stretch starred in My Father Die. Director and producer Through My Father's Eyes, a documentary about Ronda Rousey, was directed by Stretch and produced by him with help from stunt performer Pete Antico. Wreckin Hill Entertainment had been aiming for a spring 2017 release. Personal life From 1998 to 2001 Stretch was married to actress Roselyn S√°nchez. Filmography *Tis a Gift to Be Simple (1994) ...

Her work explores immigrant life in France, and the relationship between France and Africa. Fatou Diome lives in Strasbourg, France. Biography Fatou Diome was born in Niodior on the island of the same name in the Sine-Saloum Delta. She was raised by her grandmother and went to school and became passionate about French literature. At the age of 13 she left Niodior and continued her education in M'Bour. Later she moved to Dakar to study at the university, supporting herself by working as a housekeeper. In 1990 she married a Frenchman and moved to France. Rejected by her traditional Serer family and by his family, she divorced two years later. In 1994 Diome moved to Strasbourg to study at the University of Strasbourg. She is currently working on her Ph.D. in French language and literature. The title of her Ph.D. thesis is Le Voyage, les √©changes et la formation dans l'≈ìuvre litt√©raire et cin√©matographique de Ousmane Semb√®ne (Voyage, Exchanges, and Education in the Literary and Cinematographic Work of Ousmane Semb√®ne). From 2002 to 2003, she was a part- time lecturer at Marc Bloch University, Strasbourg, and at the Institute of Pedagogy of Karlsruhe (Germany). From September 2004 to November 2006, she presented the cultural and literary show Nuit Blanche (Sleepless night) on the French television channel France 3 Alsace.\\"Fatou Diome - An author from Senegal writing in French\\", Reading Women Writers and African Literatures. Works Fatou Diome published a collection of short stories, La Pr√©f√©rence nationale, in 2001. Her first novel, The Belly of the Atlantic () became a bestseller in France and is published in English by Serpent's Tail. Her first novel was partly autobiographical and is about Salie, a Senegalese immigrant living in Strasbourg, and her younger brother Madicke, who stayed behind in Senegal. After years of struggle Salie has finally arrived and settled in France. Her younger brother dreams of following her to France and to become a successful football player. The Belly of the Atlantic was translated into English, German and Spanish. Her second novel, K√©tala, was published in 2006 in France. In her work Fatou Diome explores France and Senegal, and the relationship between the two countries. Her style is influenced by the traditional oral literature of Africa. Her language is authentic and vivid and traces a portrait of the difficulties of integrating in France as an immigrant, mixed with nostalgia and memories of a childhood in Senegal. Political views Fatou Diome rebels against intolerant people, she defends the role of the school and Republicanism. Faced with the rise of populism, Fatou Diome is regularly invited to share her point of view on political and social issues on television media or press. In particular, she takes a strong position against the rise of populism in France with the ‚ÄúRassemblement National‚Äù. As a writer, in her books, she wishes to remind people of the importance of republican and human values because she believes that ‚Äúwhen facing people who are obsessed with national identity, we must no longer remain silent‚Äù . Diome pursues the subject of debt and neoliberalization in \\"Le ventre de l'Atlantique\\" (2003) and \\"Celles qui attendent\\" (2010). In both works, debt is used to defend austerity measures and drive immigrants to pursue jobs in other countries under precarious conditions. Diome also runs messages for a more egalitarian cooperation between Europe and Africa. She believes that, at the moment, Europe is controlling an unequal cooperation where Africa has no control on its assets. She also defends the idea that the former colonial power relationship remains persistent on each African and European people, which prevents this cooperation from being more egalitarian. She thinks that everyone, regardless of their origin, ‚Äúshould feel human being when facing another human being‚Äù. Therefore, without placing more responsibility on one continent than on the other, Fatou Diome proclaims the need for Africans to free themselves from their victim status and for Europeans to give up their dominant position in order to put an end to exploiting/exploited, donor/recipient schemes. Finally, the author specifies that helping people means helping them not to need you any longer, denouncing the development aid set up by Western countries in Africa among others.

He first appeared in the strip in 1975. He is generally seen as a combination of Bob Dylan and John Denver (and to some extent, Loudon Wainwright III), and became a rock star in the seventies, when he was only 19. Others have compared Thudpucker to a young Jackson Browne. Fictional character biography Unlike many of the other parodied and fictional celebrities in the strip, who are often portrayed as shallow and conceited, Jimmy is essentially a good person; he is one of the few adult characters to retain the round eyes of innocence that the strip's child characters lose when they grow up. He is very moral and not afraid to turn down money for what he feels is right. He even wrote a song about Doonesbury character Ginny Slade to help her raise money for her campaign for free, because he agreed with her politics. Jimmy is also extremely devoted to his fans, his wife Jennifer, and their son, Feedback. Jimmy expatriated to Vietnam during the 1990s, and became the number one act in the country. While there he performed in a benefit organized by Kim Rosenthal to help the poorly paid workers at a Nike plant. He has since returned to America. Jimmy's biggest fault seems to be his habit of \\"reinventing\\" himself, often switching musical genres on a whim. When he does so he changes his name to match his new style; he became Jimmy Ray Thudpucker to perform country music, MC Jimmy to perform rap music, Jimmy T. to record a Christmas album, and James R. Thudpucker III to make an album of standards. Jimmy supports file sharing, and firmly believes that in the future artists will make a modest living by touring because the recording industry will collapse and all music will be free. He has released all of his own music on the internet, to be freely shared, emulating the real world practice of Janis Ian (who has seen sales of her music radically rise after making her songs freely available on her website). Unfortunately in June 2014 he revealed that the \\"new model\\" of releasing his own music direct to his fans without a music label meant he was now living in his car. In January 2009, he branched out into recording and selling ringtones. In February 2010, he visited Afghanistan with the USO show. On the return journey his helicopter was accidentally shot down by Jeff Redfern (who was on duty for the CIA). However, Jimmy and the other helicopter passengers survived unharmed. Real world recordings In a real-world crossover, Trudeau has twice arranged for Thudpucker's \\"music\\" to be recorded. James Allen Brewer, an actor (\\"Ryan and Sean's Not So Excellent Adventure\\"), producer (\\"Simply Sondheim ‚Äì A 75th Birthday Salute\\"), and singer/songwriter co-wrote and sang, in character, on the single \\"Ginny's Song,\\" released by Warner Bros. He also performed on the LP Jimmy Thudpucker's Greatest Hits, released by Windsong Records, which featured songs from the Academy Award- nominated A Doonesbury Special (1977), which also won the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival.

If all the eigenvalues have negative real part, then the solution is called linearly stable. Other names for linear stability include exponential stability or stability in terms of first approximation.V.I. Arnold, Ordinary Differential Equations. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA (1973)P. Glendinning, Stability, instability and chaos: an introduction to the theory of nonlinear differential equations. Cambridge university press, 1994. If there exist an eigenvalue with zero real part then the question about stability cannot be solved on the basis of the first approximation and we approach the so-called \\"centre and focus problem\\".V.V. Nemytskii, V.V. Stepanov, \\"Qualitative theory of differential equations\\", Princeton Univ. Press (1960) Example 1: ODE The differential equation :\\\\frac{dx}{dt}=x-x^2 has two stationary (time-independent) solutions: x = 0 and x = 1\\\\. The linearization at x = 0 has the form \\\\frac{dx}{dt}=x. The linearized operator is A0 = 1\\\\. The only eigenvalue is \\\\lambda=1. The solutions to this equation grow exponentially; the stationary point x = 0 is linearly unstable. To derive the linearization at x = 1, one writes \\\\frac{dr}{dt}=(1+r)-(1+r)^2=-r-r^2, where r = x ‚àí 1\\\\. The linearized equation is then \\\\frac{dr}{dt}=-r; the linearized operator is A1 = ‚àí1, the only eigenvalue is \\\\lambda=-1, hence this stationary point is linearly stable. Example 2: NLS The nonlinear Schr√∂dinger equation : i\\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial t} =-\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 u}{\\\\partial x^2}-u^{2k} u , where u(x,t) ‚àà ‚ÑÇ and k > 0, has solitary wave solutions of the form \\\\phi(x)e^{-i\\\\omega t} . To derive the linearization at a solitary wave, one considers the solution in the form u(x,t)=(\\\\phi(x)+r(x,t))e^{-i\\\\omega t}. The linearized equation on r(x,t) is given by : \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\text{Re}\\\\,r \\\\text{Im} \\\\,r\\\\end{bmatrix}= A \\\\begin{bmatrix}\\\\text{Re}\\\\,r \\\\text{Im} \\\\,r\\\\end{bmatrix}, where : A=\\\\begin{bmatrix}0&L;_0\\\\-L_1&0\\\\end{bmatrix}, with : L_0=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^2}-k\\\\phi^2-\\\\omega and : L_1=-\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial x^2}-(2k+1)\\\\phi^2-\\\\omega the differential operators. According to Vakhitov‚ÄìKolokolov stability criterion , when k > 2, the spectrum of A has positive point eigenvalues, so that the linearized equation is linearly (exponentially) unstable; for 0 < k ‚â§ 2, the spectrum of A is purely imaginary, so that the corresponding solitary waves are linearly stable. It should be mentioned that linear stability does not automatically imply stability; in particular, when k = 2, the solitary waves are unstable. On the other hand, for 0 < k < 2, the solitary waves are not only linearly stable but also orbitally stable.

The first installment in the Silent Hill series, the game was released in North America and Europe in February 1999 and in Japan in March 1999. Silent Hill uses a third-person view, with real-time rendering of 3D environments. To mitigate limitations of the console hardware, developers liberally used fog and darkness to muddle the graphics. Unlike earlier survival horror games that focused on protagonists with combat training, the player character of Silent Hill is an \\"everyman\\". The game follows Harry Mason as he searches for his missing adopted daughter in the eponymous fictional American town of Silent Hill; stumbling upon a cult conducting a ritual to revive a deity it worships, he discovers her true origin. Five game endings are possible, depending on actions taken by the player, including one joke ending. Silent Hill received positive reviews from critics on its release and was commercially successful. It is considered a defining title in the survival horror genre, and is also considered by many to be one of the greatest video games ever made, as it moved away from B movie horror elements toward a more psychological horror style, emphasizing atmosphere. Various adaptations of Silent Hill have been released, including a 2001 visual novel, the 2006 feature film Silent Hill, and a 2009 reimagining of the game, titled Silent Hill: Shattered Memories. The game was followed by Silent Hill 2 in 2001, and a direct sequel, Silent Hill 3, in 2003. Gameplay Harry's flashlight is the sole light source for the majority of the game. The objective of the player is to guide main protagonist and player character Harry Mason through a monster-filled town as he searches for his lost daughter, Cheryl. Silent Hills gameplay consists of combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The game uses a third-person view, with the camera occasionally switching to other angles for dramatic effect, in pre-scripted areas. This is a change from older survival horror games, which constantly shifted through a variety of camera angles. Because Silent Hill has no heads-up display, the player must consult a separate menu to check Harry's \\"health\\". If a DualShock controller is used a heart beat rhythm can be felt signifying that the player is at low health. Harry confronts monsters in each area with both melee weapons and firearms. An ordinary man, Harry cannot sustain many blows from enemies, and gasps for breath after sprinting. His inexperience in handling firearms means that his aim, and therefore the player's targeting of enemies, is often unsteady. A portable radio collected early in the game alerts Harry to the presence of nearby creatures with bursts of static. The player can locate and collect maps of each area, stylistically similar to tourist maps. Accessible from the menu and readable only when sufficient light is present, each map is marked with places of interest. Visibility is mostly low due to fog and darkness; the latter is prevalent in the \\"Otherworld\\". The player locates a pocket-size flashlight early in the game, but the light beam illuminates only a few feet. Navigating through Silent Hill requires the player to find keys and solve puzzles.  Plot  Silent Hill opens with Harry Mason's drive to the titular town with his adopted daughter Cheryl for a vacation. At the town's edge, he swerves to avoid hitting a girl in the road, and as a result, he crashes and loses consciousness. Waking up in town, he realizes that Cheryl is missing and sets out to look for her. The town is deserted and foggy, with snow falling out of season, and he begins to experience bouts of unconsciousness and encounters with hostile creatures. During his exploration of the town, he meets Cybil Bennett, a police officer from the neighboring town who is investigating the mysterious occurrences. Dahlia Gillespie, a cultist, gifts him the Flauros, a charm which she claims can counteract the darkness spreading through the town. In the town's hospital, he encounters its director, Dr. Michael Kaufmann, bewildered by the sudden changes in the town, and discovers a frightened, amnesiac nurse, Lisa Garland, hiding in one of the rooms. Harry comes to believe that a darkness is transforming the town into someone's nightmare, which is why the inhabitants have mostly disappeared. Dahlia urges him to stop \\"the demon\\" responsible for it‚Äîthe girl in the road who appears to him sporadically‚Äîor Cheryl will die. Harry can later rescue Kaufmann from a monster, discover evidence of Kaufman's role in the local drug trafficking, and stumble upon Kaufmann's hidden bottle of aglaophotis, a supernatural liquid that can exorcise demons. Continuing his search, Harry finds himself drawn into a fight with Cybil, who has become the host to a supernatural parasite; the player can choose to save her. The next time Harry sees the girl, the Flauros activates and neutralizes her telepathic powers. Dahlia then appears and reveals that she manipulated Harry into catching the girl‚Äîan apparition of her daughter, Alessa. Harry then awakens in the hospital again, next to Lisa. Lisa explains that she experienced a sense of deja vu while in the basement, and when he finds her again, she despairs that she is \\"the same as them\\". She pleads with Harry to save her, and blood runs down her face; horrified, he flees. Her diary reveals that she nursed Alessa during a secret, forced hospitalization. Alessa's never-healing wounds terrified her, as she fell deeper into a drug addiction fueled by Kaufman. Finding Dahlia with Alessa's defeated apparition and charred body, Harry demands to know Cheryl's whereabouts: he discovers that seven years earlier, Dahlia conducted a ritual to force Alessa to birth the cult's deity; Alessa survived being immolated because her status as vessel rendered her immortal, while her mental resistance to the ritual caused her soul to be bisected, preventing the birth. One half manifested as the infant Cheryl, whom Harry and his wife adopted. Dahlia then casts a spell to lure Cheryl back, while Alessa was imprisoned within the hospital, enduring unceasing agony as a result of her injuries. With Alessa's plan thwarted and her soul rejoined, the deity is revived and possesses her. Four different endings are available, dependent on the player's previous actions. In the \\"Bad\\" ending, the deity merges with Alessa and electrocutes Dahlia before attacking Harry. He defeats it, and Cheryl's voice thanks him for freeing her. Overcome by grief, Harry collapses, and the next scene is that of his corpse in his wrecked car. The \\"Bad +\\" ending concludes with Harry and Cybil fleeing instead after the deity's demise. In the \\"Good\\" ending, Kaufmann, now feeling betrayed by Dahlia, demands that she restore the town to normal and uses aglaophotis to exorcise the deity out of Alessa. Harry defeats the deity, and Alessa gives him an infant, the reincarnation of herself and Cheryl. She then helps him escape from her nightmare realm. In the \\"Good +\\" ending, Harry escapes with Cybil and the baby. In both \\"Good\\" endings, a bloody and vengeful Lisa prevents Kaufmann from escaping with Harry. The joke ending features extraterrestrials abducting Harry. Development =Design= Development of Silent Hill started in September 1996. The game was created by Team Silent, a group of staff members within the Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo studio. Konami sought to produce a game that would be successful in the United States. For this reason, a Hollywood- like atmosphere was used for Silent Hill. The staff members that were assigned to the game's development had failed at their previous projects. They intended to leave Konami, as they were not allowed to realize their own ideas, and were not compatible with the company's other teams. According to composer Akira Yamaoka, the developers did not know how to proceed with the Silent Hill project, either. As the time passed, the personnel and management of Konami lost their faith in the game, and the members of Team Silent increasingly felt like outsiders. Despite the profit-oriented approach of the parent company, however, the developers of Silent Hill had much artistic freedom because the game was still produced as in the era of lower-budget 2D titles. Eventually, the development staff decided to ignore the limits of Konami's initial plan, and to make Silent Hill a game that would appeal to the emotions of players instead. For this purpose, the team introduced a \\"fear of the unknown\\" as a psychological type of horror. The plot was made vague and occasionally contradictory to leave its true meaning in the dark, and to make players reflect upon unexplained parts. Director Keiichiro Toyama created the game's scenario, while programmer Hiroyuki Owaku wrote the text for the riddles. Toyama did not have much experience of horror movies but was interested in UFOs, the occult and David Lynch movies which influenced the game's development. Toyama questioned Konami's decision to appoint him as director, as he had never been one prior to Silent Hill. The localization company Latina International, which had previously worked on Final Fantasy VII, translated the script into English. The town of Silent Hill is an interpretation of a small American community as imagined by the Japanese team. It was based on Western literature and films, as well as on depictions of American towns in European and Russian culture. The game's joke ending came out of a suggestion box created to find alternative reasons for the occurrences in Silent Hill. Artist Takayoshi Sato corrected inconsistencies in the plot, and designed the game's cast of characters. As a young employee, Sato was initially restricted to basic tasks such as font design and file sorting. He also created 3D demos and presentations, and taught older staff members the fundamentals of 3D modeling. However, he was not credited for this work as he did not have as much respect within Konami as older employees. Sato eventually approached the company's higher-ups with a short demo movie he had rendered, and threatened to withhold this technical knowledge from other staff members if he was not assigned to 3D work. As a consequence, his superior had to give in to his demand, and he was allowed to do character designs. Instead of relying on illustrations, Sato conceived the characters of Silent Hill while creating their computer-generated models. He gave each their own distinctive characteristics, but made Harry almost completely neutral as he wanted to avoid forcing interpretations of the game on the players. Creating the skull shapes for the faces of the American cast was difficult because he had no Caucasian co-workers to use for reference. Although Sato was largely responsible for the game's cinematics and characters at this point, his superior still did not want to fully credit his work, and intended to assign a visual supervisor to him. To prevent this from happening, Sato volunteered to create the full-motion videos of Silent Hill by himself. Over the course of two and a half years, he lived in the development team's office, as he had to render the scenes with the approximately 150 Unix-based computers of his coworkers after they left work at the end of a day. Sato estimated the game's budget was lower than the cost of Japan's biggest games at the time. He said the development team intended to make Silent Hill a masterpiece rather than a traditional sales-oriented game, and that they opted for an engaging story, which would persist over time ‚Äì similar to successful literature. The game debuted at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, where the presentations of movies and in-game scenes garnered applause from the audience. This favorable reception persuaded Konami to allot more personnel and public relation initiatives to the project. Konami later showcased Silent Hill at the European Computer Trade Show in London, and included a demo with its stealth game Metal Gear Solid in Japan. The names and designs of some Silent Hill creatures and puzzles are based on books enjoyed by the character of Alessa, including The Lost World by Arthur Conan Doyle and Lewis Carroll's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. The game contains several real-life references, particularly in characters' names. Cheryl Mason's first name is based on actress Sheryl Lee's first name, and Lisa Garland's surname is taken from actress Judy Garland. \\"Michael Kaufmann\\" is a combination of Troma Studios producers Michael Herz's and Lloyd Kaufmann's first name and surname, respectively. Alessa's original name was \\"Asia\\", and Dahlia's was \\"Daria\\", based on the first names of actresses Asia Argento and Daria Nicolodi ‚Äì Argento's mother. Harry's name was originally \\"Humbert\\", and Cheryl's was \\"Dolores\\", in reference to the protagonist and title character of Vladimir Nabokov's novel Lolita. The American staff altered these names, as they considered them too uncommon. Fictitious religious items appearing in the game have used various religions as a basis: the evil spirit-dispelling substance Aglaophotis, which is said to be made from a medicinal herb, is based on a herb of similar name and nature in the Kabbalah (Jewish mysticism); the \\"Seal of Metatron\\" (also referred to by Dahlia as the \\"Mark of Samael\\") references the angels Metatron and Samael, respectively; and the name of the \\"Flauros\\" was taken from the eponymous demon appearing in the Lemegeton, a book on magic said to have been compiled by writings of King Solomon. Certain items and doors in the \\"nowhere\\" dimension of the game were given names based on occult elements in order to symbolize magical traits of Dahlia. The names of these doors were taken from the names of the angels Ophiel, Hagith, Phaleg, and Bethor, who appear in a medieval book of black magic and are supposed to rule over planets. This motif of giving names that suggest planets was used to signify that \\"a deeper part of the realm of Alessa's mind is being entered\\", according to Owaku. =Music= Akira Yamaoka requested to compose the soundtrack for Silent Hill after the original musician decided to leave the development team. The soundtrack for Silent Hill was composed by sound director Akira Yamaoka, who requested to join the development staff after the original musician had left. In addition to the music, he was in charge of tasks such as sound effect creation and audio mastering. Yamaoka did not watch game scenes, but created the music independently from its visuals. The style of his compositions was influenced by Twin Peaks composer Angelo Badalamenti. To differentiate Silent Hill from other games as much as possible, and to give it a cold and rusty feel, Yamaoka opted for industrial music. When he presented his musical pieces to the other staff members for the first time, they misinterpreted their sound as a game bug. Yamaoka had to explain that this noise was intended for the music, and the team only withdrew their initial objection after he elaborated on his reasons for choosing this style. On March 5, 1999, the album Silent Hill Original Soundtracks was released in Japan. The 41st track on the CD, the ending theme \\"Esper√°ndote\\", was composed by Rika Muranaka. After Yamaoka had approached her to create a piece of music for the game, she suggested the use of bandone√≥ns, violins, and a Spanish- speaking singer. It was decided to make the song a tango, and Muranaka composed the melody for the English lyrics she had conceived. When she arrived in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to record the translated Spanish lyrics with Argentine singer Vanesa Quiroz, Muranaka realized that the syllables did not match the melodic line any more, and she had to recompose it in five minutes. On October 29, 2013, Perseverance Records released a \\"Best Of\\" album, which features 16 newly interpreted instrumental tracks composed by Akira Yamaoka and arranged and performed by Edgar Rothermich. The 17th track on the album is the ballad \\"I Want Love\\" performed by Romina Arena. Release Silent Hill was released for the PlayStation in North America and Europe on February 23, 1999; and in Japan on March 4. It was included in the Japanese Silent Hill Complete Set in 2006. On March 19, 2009, Silent Hill became available for download from the European PlayStation Network store of the PlayStation 3 and the PlayStation Portable. Two days later, the game was removed due to \\"unforeseen circumstances\\". On September 10 same year Silent Hill was released on the North American PlayStation Network. On October 26, 2011 it was re- released on the European PlayStation Network. Adaptations A radically altered version of Silent Hill was released for the Game Boy Advance. Titled Play Novel: Silent Hill and released only in Japan in 2001, it is a gamebook- style visual novel. It contains a retelling of Silent Hills story through text-based gameplay, with the player occasionally confronted with questions concerning what direction to take the character, as well as the puzzles, which are a major part of Silent Hills gameplay. After completing the game once, the player has the option of playing as Cybil in a second scenario, with a third made available for download once the second scenario has been completed. When the game was exhibited, Western critics were unimpressed, and criticized the lack of any soundtrack as severely detracting from the \\"horror\\" factor of the game. A film adaptation, also titled Silent Hill, was released on April 21, 2006. The film, directed by Christophe Gans, was based largely but loosely on the game, incorporating elements from Silent Hill 2, 3, and 4. Gans replaced Harry Mason with a female main protagonist, Rose Da Silva, because he felt Harry had many qualities typically perceived as feminine. When designing the film's visual elements, Gans was influenced by fellow directors Michael Mann, David Lynch, and David Cronenberg. The film's soundtrack includes music composed by Yamaoka. Although critical reaction was mostly negative, the film was a financial success and was praised by fans, especially for its visuals. A \\"reimagining\\" of Silent Hill, titled Silent Hill: Shattered Memories, was developed by Climax Studios and published by Konami Digital Entertainment. The game was released on December 8, 2009, for the Wii and on January 19, 2010, for the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation Portable, to mostly positive reviews. Although it retains the premise of a man's search for his missing daughter, Shattered Memories branches off into a different plot with altered characters. It features psychological profiling which alters various in-game elements depending on the player's response to questions in therapy, lacks the combat of Silent Hill, and replaces the \\"Otherworld\\" with a series of chase sequences through an alternate frozen version of the town. Reception Silent Hill received generally positive reviews, gaining an 86/100 aggregate at ratings website Metacritic. The game sold over two million copies, which gained Silent Hill a place in the American PlayStation Greatest Hits budget releases. In November 1999, the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) gave Silent Hill a \\"Gold\\" award, indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Silent Hill has been compared to the Resident Evil series of survival horror video games. Bobba Fatt of GamePro labeled Silent Hill a \\"shameless but slick Resident Evil clone\\", while Edge described it as \\"a near-perfect sim nightmare\\". Others felt that Silent Hill was Konami's answer to the Resident Evil series in that, while they noted a similarity, Silent Hill utilized a different form of horror to induce fear, attempting to form a disturbing atmosphere for the player, in contrast to the visceral scares and action-oriented approach of Resident Evil. Adding to the atmosphere was the audio, which was well-received; Billy Matjiunis of TVG described the ambient music as \\"engrossing\\"; a reviewer for Game Revolution also praised the audio, commenting that the sound and music \\"will set you on edge\\". Less well-received was the voice acting which, although some reviewers remarked it was better than that found in the Resident Evil series, was found poor overall by reviewers, and accompanied by pauses between lines that served to spoil the atmosphere. Reviewers noted that Silent Hill used real-time 3D environments, in contrast to the pre-rendered environments found in Resident Evil. Fog and darkness were heavily used to disguise the limitations of the hardware. Along with the grainy textures - also from hardware limitations\\\\- most reviewers felt that these factors actually worked in the game's favor; Francesca Reyes of IGN described it as \\"adding to the atmosphere of dilapidation and decay\\". In using 3D environments, however, controls became an issue, and in \\"tougher\\" areas, maneuverability became \\"an exercise in frustration\\". The game's popularity as the first in the series was further recognized long after its release; a list of the best PS games of all time by IGN in 2000 listed it as the 14th-best PS game, while a 2005 article by GameSpy detailing the best PS games listed Silent Hill as the 15th-best game produced for the console. A GameTrailers video feature in 2006 ranked Silent Hill as number one in its list of the top ten scariest games of all time. In 2005, the game was credited for moving the survival horror genre away from B movie horror elements to the psychological style seen in art house or Japanese horror films, due to the game's emphasis on a disturbing atmosphere rather than visceral horror. In November 2012, Time named it one of the 100 greatest video games of all time.

Under the National Security Act, the government may limit the expression of ideas that praise or incite the activities of anti-state individuals or groups. South Korea has one of the freest media environments in Asia, ranking ahead of Japan, China and Singapore in the Press Freedom Index. However, since the inauguration of President Lee Myung-bak in 2008, South Korea has experienced a noticeable decline in freedom of expression for both journalists and the general public. South Korea's status in the 2011 Freedom of the Press report from Freedom House declined from \\"Free\\" to \\"Partly Free\\" reflecting an increase in official censorship and government attempts to influence news and information content. President Moon Jae-in further reinforced media censorship by snooping on SNI traffic.  History  South Korea's government has had a hand in censorship of media within the country since it adopted the National Security Act in 1948. The law gave the government broad control over media in order to prevent any information deemed to be a threat to the government from dissemination to the public at large. The newly established Republic of Korea government created the law in response to widespread unrest due to conflict between the right-wing anti-communist government and far-left People's Committee. Originally, the law was enacted in opposition to specific North Korean forces, but it was later expanded to encapsulate any \\"anti-state\\" group seen as against the views of the government. Importantly, the law allows the government to punish anyone who would \\"praise, encourage, disseminate or cooperate\\" with the efforts of a group deemed to be \\"anti-state\\" with up to 7 years in prison. In addition, directly working with one of these groups results in a minimum jail sentence of one year. = Park Chung-hee Regime (1961-1979) = After Park Chung-hee's military coup and subsequent rise to power in 1961, his regime invalidated the Constitution as well as the democratically elected legislature. Park used the implied threat of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to imprison and torture political enemies. His regime targeted artists and politicians alike, jailing leaders who would later hold the office as president as well as writers such as Kim Chi-ha. In addition, the Park regime ran a large campaign of film censorship. Scripts required approval by censor committees, and several viewings of the final version of the film were required to ensure that it represented the previously approved script. Eliminating themes of rebellion, protest were the main focus of the censors. The censors also targeted any accurate depiction of the political or socio-economic climate. = Chun Doo-hwan Regime (1980-1988) = After Chun Doo-hwan assumed power in another military coup, he too declared martial law in response to widespread uprisings among the country's students. He also took aim at South Korea's press, systematically sacking 937 members of the press while nationalizing the country's media outlets. Due to foreign and domestic condemnation of Chun's policies and actions, a new Constitution was formed which guaranteed the freedom to organize into opposition parties. Although the political climate liberalized slightly with the new Constitution, the regime continued to target perceived threats from North Korea with the powers granted by the National Security Law. = Roh Tae- woo Regime (1988-1993) = During the early presidency of Roh Tae-woo, student uprisings continued in the face of apparent attempts by Roh to consolidate the new regime and extend his presidential term past the constitutional limit. The protests specifically targeted the government's use of the National Security Act under the pretenses of curtailing North Korean influence in South Korean media. = Sixth Republic Era (1993-Present) = The dawn of the nineties brought about movements pushing for greater democracy and unification efforts for the Korean peninsula. These forces sought to abolish the use of the National Security Law. However, in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis, student and worker protests against unemployment erupted. Once more, the government suppressed these demonstrations under the auspices of the National Security Law. In 2019, Korean Ministry of Gender Equality and Family proposed strict guidelines on their K-pop stars, essentially censoring most content deemed \\"unhealthy\\" by them, only to be met with strong opposition among fans of the genre. The proposal was eventually withdrawn. Subject matter and agenda =Speech and the press= There is an active independent media that expresses a wide variety of views, generally without restriction. Under the National Security Law, the government may limit the expression of ideas that praise or incite the activities of antistate individuals or groups. The law forbids citizens from reading books published in North Korea. On March 21, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and expression issued a report on his May 2010 visit to South Korea. While laudatory of progress made, the report also expressed concern about increased restrictions on freedom of expression and specifically cited as concerns laws broadly making defamation a crime (which the rapporteur labeled as ‚Äú‚Ä¶inherently harsh and [having a] disproportionate chilling effect‚Ä¶‚Äù) and providing the potential for controlling the dissemination of election or candidate information and banning books. =Pornography= Distribution of pornography is a felony, and can result in a fine or a prison sentence not exceeding one-year. There are no laws to punish individuals for watching, downloading or storing pornography. Since 2009, pornographic websites have been blocked by the South Korean government. In 2012 the Ministry of Public Administration and Security released statistics that cited 39.5% of South Korean children having experienced watching online pornography, with 14.2% of those who have viewed online pornography reportedly \\"wanting to imitate\\" it. In 2019 the Korea Communications Standards Commission began blocking banned websites based on filtering of Server Name Indication. The KCC said their focus was \\"on blocking sites with child pornography, illegal films and gambling.\\" =Public libraries= South Korea's public libraries censor a plethora of subjects in their libraries - both online and in their physical collections. Examples of censored topics include: sexuality (including educational information about the subject), homosexuality, information about North Korea, violence, anti-government materials, and political discourse.Lange, D.

If a person or group wants to use the space to meet to discuss any of the forbidden topics listed above, they are refused. =Military= The Constitutional Court of Korea upheld the Ministry of National Defense's order to allow the banning of certain books such as Ha-Joon Chang's Bad Samaritans and Hans-Peter Martin's The Global Trap from soldiers' hands on October 2010, despite a petition made by a group of military judicial officers protesting against the order in 2008. The South Korean military cracked down on soldiers who have \\"critical apps\\" installed in their smartphones; allegedly marking a popular South Korean podcast, Naneun Ggomsuda, as anti-government content. =Education= On 15 February 2011, a Handong Global University professor was penalized for criticizing Lee Myung- bak and the university chancellor.

South Korea's government maintains a broad-ranging approach toward the regulation of specific online content and imposes a substantial level of censorship on election-related discourse and on a large number of websites that the government deems subversive or socially harmful.OpenNet Initiative \\"Summarized global Internet filtering data spreadsheet\\", 8 November 2011 and \\"Country Profiles\\", the OpenNet Initiative is a collaborative partnership of the Citizen Lab at the Munk School of Global Affairs, University of Toronto; the Berkman Center for Internet & Society at Harvard University; and the SecDev Group, Ottawa Such policies are particularly pronounced with regard to anonymity on the Internet. In 2011 the OpenNet Initiative classified Internet censorship in South Korea as pervasive in the conflict/security area, as selective in the social area, and found no evidence of filtering in the political or Internet tools areas. In 2011 South Korea was included on Reporters Without Borders list of countries Under Surveillance.\\"Countries under surveillance: South Korea\\" , Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2011 The Electronic Frontier Foundation has criticized the Korea Communications Standards Commission for proposing censorship of the blog of an internet free speech activist. In September 2004, North Korea launched the website. Also, South Korea has banned at least 31 sites considered sympathetic to North Korea through the use of IP blocking. A man who praised North Korea on Twitter was arrested. In 2007, numerous bloggers were censored, arrested, and their posts deleted by police for expressing criticism of, or even support for, certain presidential candidates. Subsequently, in 2008, just before a new presidential election, new legislation that required all major internet portal sites to require identity verification of their users was put into effect.\\"Do new Internet regulations curb free speech?\\", Kim Hyung-eun, Korea JoongAng Daily, 13 August 2008 51 year old South Korean novelist was arrested for praising North Korea on personal blog in 2012.http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/ND20Dg01.html 5 South Koreans were arrested for distributing pro-North material online in 2008 and 83 in 2011.

Songs that \\"stimulates sex desire or [are] sexually explicit to youth\\", \\"urges violence or crime to youth\\", or \\"glamorizes violence such as rape, and drugs\\" are classified as a \\"medium offensive to youth\\" by the Government Youth Commission. =Broadcasting= The Korea Communications Commission is a government agency that regulates TV, radio, and the Internet within South Korea. The National Security Law forbids citizens from listening to North Korean radio programs in their homes if the government determines that the action endangers national security or the basic order of democracy. These prohibitions are rarely enforced and viewing North Korean satellite telecasts in private homes is legal.\\"Republic of Korea\\", Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2011, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, U.S. Department of State The Lee Myung-bak government has been accused of extending its influence over the broadcast media by appointing former presidential aides and advisers to key positions at major media companies over the objections of journalists who sought to maintain those broadcasters‚Äô editorial independence. Under the Lee administration, approximately 160 journalists have been penalized for writing critical reports about government policies.\\"South Korea\\", Freedom of the Press 2011, Freedom House Protests among workers in Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation, Korean Broadcasting System, and YTN in early 2012 have raised concerns about the biased pro-Lee Myung-bak government media practices, such as the ongoing usage of censorship, to the South Korean public. Censorship of Japanese media in South Korea has been relaxed significantly since the 1990s, but as of 2012 the terrestrial broadcast of Japanese television or music remains illegal. =Films= Film censorship in South Korea can be split into two major periods, the period of dictatorships and the period of heavy surveillance by the new military regime. In recent years, sexual scenes have been a major issue that pits filmmakers against the Korea Media Rating Board. Pubic hair and male or female genitalia are disallowed on the screen, unless they are digitally blurred. In rare cases extreme violence, obscene language, or certain portrayals of drug use may also be an issue.

Founded in 1938, Campamento Guajataka is a Scout Reservation where their members mostly attends for recreational activities, summer camps, seminars, leadership training and Scouting-related meetings. Scouts and leaders who visit are lodged in one of the ten campsites, in-campsite cabins or stand-alone cabin-campsites of the reservation. These campsites feature a series of concrete-and-wood cabins that house its campers. The campsites are named by letters with some exceptions (Campsites A, B, C, D, M, SP). Also, the Paquito Joglar, El Palomar, Manol√≠n and Cobana Negra campsites are stand-alone cabin-campsites that are located inside the camp's vast tropical mamelluelos woods and nature. The Paquito Joglar and Manol√≠n are cabins named in honor of distinguished Scouting figures of Puerto Rico while the SP or Swimming Pool Campsite, Palomar and Cobana Negra cabins are named based on their location, flora or physical characteristics. The camp's runs all year round. The most popular seasons are Holy Week, Summer and Christmas and the time frames varies. The main program is presented during the summer, in which ten weeks are divided for Cub Scouts, Scouts BSA, and Venturing. The Christmas season runs for a single week and summarizes the summer's offerings open for both Cub Scouts and Scouts BSA. A short three-to-four-day camp has also been offered during Spring Break with a similar program to the one offered during the Christmas camp. The camp also operates off-season for special troop activities or external groups that wish to experience the outdoor spirit of the reservation. Guajataka is the official home of Yokahu Lodge, the council's Order of the Arrow Lodge. Most of Yokahu Lodge's activities are celebrated in the camp and for years the Order has given service to the facilities. The OA has its own campsite, called \\"The Cabin\\", which occupancy has been discontinued due to structural damages, but remains standing. In the past, the Paquito Joglar campsite area was considered the official gathering place for the Lodge, later becoming a campers area due to the need of space for the many Scouts that attended camp in summer. Camp staff The staff of the camp are structured based on Scouting's patrol system. These patrols are based on different specialization areas in the camp's program. The current patrols are Program Aide (Scoutcraft/Scout skills), Nature Team (ecology and conservation), Aquatic Team (pool and lake activities), Sport Team (sports and recreation), Staff Administrativo (camp administration), Voyagers (high adventure, treks and Project C.O.P.E.) and the Order of the Arrow patrol. The patrols are led by a Director, who serves as an administrative official, and a Patrol Leader, in charge of the patrol's specific program. In the past, each patrol had its own campsite in which they pitched their own tents and worked on pioneering gates that awed campers and visitors alike. All staff members were located in a single house cabin called \\"Casa Staff\\" (Staff House) from 2006 to 2018. Due to its long history, the patrol system has served to develop a series of traditions inside each patrol. A tradition shared by all patrols is a simple recognition, symbolized by a neckerchief, presented to a Staff member who has truly served the patrol and the camp, demonstrates and shares their knowledge, and, most of the times, has been a member of the patrol for two or more years. Their neckerchiefs as well as their shoelaces (a tradition of Guajataka Camp patrols) have different colors, each color representing a specific patrol: red (Program Aide), forest green (Nature Team), light blue (Aquatic Team), purple (Sport Team), yellow (Administrative Staff), and navy blue (Expedition Voyagers). =Order of the Arrow= Yokahu Lodge 506 is the Order of the Arrow Lodge of the Puerto Rico Council, founded in 1954 by Luis Mat√≠as Ferrer and Dr. Frank H. Wadsworth. Girl Scouts of the USA in Puerto Rico =Caribe Girl Scout Council= Girl Scouting in Puerto Rico is administered by the Caribe Girl Scout Council of the Girl Scouts of the USA. It is headquartered in San Juan. The first troop was formed in 1926 in Cabo Rojo by Elisa Colberg. The Council owns Camp Elisa Colberg, established in 1948, in Rio Grande, Camp Mar√≠a Emilia in A√±asco and Camp Provi Biaggi in Ponce. The Spanish translation of Girl Scout is Ni√±a Escucha but it is also widely understood and used in English in Puerto Rico. The council's newsletter is called Ni√±a Escucha. Girl Scouts earn a uniquely designed badge created by the council called Los Faros de Puerto Rico (The Lighthouses of Puerto Rico). In 2006, painter Mois√©s Fragela donated one of his paintings entitled Quedo en Nada (Left in Nothing) to the Caribe Council which was sold in auction for funding part of the renovations and improvements towards the council's campsites. In 2017, shortly after Hurricane Maria, 2,000 new members joined the Caribe Council.

In 1965, the new Virgin Islands Council chartered its own Order of the Arrow Lodge, Arawak Lodge 562. Rudolph Valentino (Rudy) Sille, Sr. was Scout Master of Troop 17, and later Troop 100, in Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands from the 1970s to the 1990s. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Troop 152, sponsored by Saint Patrick's Church, Frederiksted, Saint Croix, formed a steel band of grammar-school-age Scouts that was managed by Vivian Bennerson. The band toured internationally. As of 2004, the Great House in Estate Diamond, Saint Croix that served as council headquarters was deserted; possibly the destruction of Hurricane Hugo caused its abandonment. As of March 1, 2013, the Virgin Island Council was merged into the National Capital Area Council, headquarters in Bethesda, Maryland, and the postal initials \\"VI\\" were added to the NCAC council shoulder patch.

He served initially as interim president following his overthrow of then- president Jos√© Luis Tejada in 1936 and again as de facto president after overthrowing Tejada's successor David Toro Ruilova the following year. He would later be elected by the National Convention in 1938 as Constitutional President of the Republic only to declare himself dictator just one year later. He is considered an extremely enigmatic character, wrapped in legend with controversy even about the place of his birth, disputed between Santa Cruz and Beni. To this day there is the controversy of his death: suicide or murder, at a time when he was serving as President of the Republic.  Early life and education  Germ√°n Busch was born on March 23, 1904. He was the son of Pablo Busch Wiesner, a physician and German immigrant from M√ºnster, and Raquel Becerra Villavicencio who was of Italian descent.Bailey, Nasatir, pg 639 For some time, Germ√°n Busch's birthplace was under dispute with some historians pointing to San Javier, in central Bolivia's hot, fertile, coffee- growing department of Santa Cruz, and others to El Carmen de Itenez, in the northern cattle-growing department of Beni. The dispute was put to rest when one of the descendants of the Busch family declared publicly on the UMSA television channel that the true place of birth of Germ√°n Busch corresponds to the town of San Javier, Santa Cruz. The definitive evidence presented by the relative is found in the will of Pablo Busch Wiesener in whose inheritance deeds he places the names of all his children, with their corresponding places of birth. At some point in Busch's childhood, his father went to Germany, while sending the young boy and his mother to live in the town of Trinidad where he would spend a large part of his childhood. In 1922, at the age of 18, he entered the Military College of the Army in the capital of La Paz where he achieved the rank of Second Lieutenant of Cavalry in 1927 and was assistant to the orders of the General Staff. In 1931, he was promoted to Lieutenant and awarded the Order of the Condor of the Andes for his expedition to the missions of San Ignacio de Zamucos in the Chaco.  Chaco War  In September 1932 the Chaco War broke out between Bolivia and Paraguay where he participated in that conflict's first engagement at the battle of Boquer√≥n. In the first stages of the Chaco War, he saved an entire division from certain destruction during the battle of Gondra, as well as a part of his own cavalry regiment -fighting on foot- which he drove out from the Campo V√≠a pocket.Farcau, Bruce W. (1996). The Chaco War: Bolivia and Paraguay, 1932-1935. Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 157. He would go on to be promoted to captain for his bravery in various actions after the battle of Boquer√≥n . As a Major, he took part, and carried out the bulk of the action, in the highly controversial coup d'√©tat that overthrew the Constitutional President Daniel Salamanca on November 27, 1934, right in the middle of the war and only twelve kilometers from the frontline. The reason for this was the constant butting of heads of the Bolivian High Command with Salamanca over the conduct of the war and the issuing of military appointments and promotions. When President Salamanca decided to travel in-person to the theater of operations to dismiss General Enrique Pe√±aranda and replace him, the main leaders of the Bolivian army ordered cannons to be aimed at the chalet of the Staudt house where the president was staying. Major Busch, on the orders of Colonel David Toro, surrounded the residence and forced Salamanca's resignation.  Political rise  = 1936 coup = Busch again conspired in 1936, this time overthrowing Salamanca's successor and former Vice-President, Jos√© Luis Tejada. Tejada was disdained by the Bolivian military leaders who viewed him as one of the old political elites who irresponsibly led them to war and then didn't suitably equip them to win it. The president's inability the manage to crippling economic woes the nation was undergoing was sufficient cause for young officers like Busch to overthrow him. He served as interim president for three days between 17 May and 20 May, 1936 before installing his higher-ranked friend and comrade David Toro, who was Tejada's Chief of Staff, as de facto president. = 1937 coup = Toro presided over a reformist experiment called Military Socialism (championed by Busch) for a bit over a year. Soon, however, the Toro administration earned the discontent of the indigenous population and the army. Busch himself felt unsatisfied with Toro's seemingly unending pragmatism and political compromises which to him appeared to be leading nowhere. On July 13, 1937, Busch lead a political movement with the support of military officers and supported by the citizens, achieving the resignation of Toro and installing himself in the Palacio Quemado. Busch assumed the presidency at age 33, the second youngest President of Bolivia after Antonio Jos√© de Sucre.  Presidency (1937-1939)  Although Busch was a national hero, his political leanings were unknown to the general population. The left and right alike assumed he would revert from Toro's military socialism to the traditional political establishment Bolivia had seen prior to the Chaco War, a sentiment Busch himself did little to clarify. While showing a tendency for economic conservatism, politically his regime began to adopt more radical elements of Toro's administration. = National Convention of 1938 = President Toro had called for a National Convention in 1937 to be held the next year. Following his resignation, Busch organized a new governing board that in March, 1938 called for the election of a constituent assembly which was to be held from May 23 to October 30, and be charged with rewriting the constitution of Bolivia. The convention was the opportunity for new postwar political forces to assert themselves against the traditional prewar Genuine Republican, Liberal, and Socialist Republican parties who, in turn, attempted to reestablish the old order. Soon, labor, veteran, moderate, and even radical leftist movements banded together into an electoral alliance which was endorsed by Busch. Faced with this new movement led by Busch, the traditional parties withdrew from the election allowing the so-called Generaci√≥n del Chaco to win in a landslide and giving them full control over the convention. On May 27, 1938, it elected Busch president and, in October, the body successfully produced the Bolivian Constitution of 1938 one of the most important in history due to its social character. = Constitutional presidency (1938-1939) = Bogged down for most of his presidency in the procedural aspects of enacting a new political framework (the Assembly, the new Constitution) Busch was not able to pass many meaningful reforms, despite his stated aim of \\"deepening\\" the Military Socialism of Toro. Despite continually rising in their power, the fragmented groups of the left remained in constant flux. Parties joined and separated in attempts to form viable coalitions but truly national parties could not arise without firm leadership which could rally support and organization, something Busch demonstrated an inability to do.  Treaty of Peace between Bolivia and Paraguay  Busch in the Palacio Quemado, 1938On July 21 of 1938, the Treaty of Peace, Friendship and Boundaries between Bolivia and Paraguay was signed in Buenos Aires bringing a conclusive end to the Chaco War. The treaty, signed by Minister of Foreign Affairs Eduardo D√≠ez de Medina and approved by the National Convention, granted roughly 75% of the Chaco Boreal to Paraguay with the conditions established by the Busch administration, mainly in relation to Bolivia's access to the Paraguay River. The treaty entered into force on 29 August, 1938.  Creation of Pando  On September 24, Busch created the department of Pando separating it from the neighbouring department of Beni and naming it after former President Jos√© Manuel Pando who had overseen the Acre War in the region and had toured the entire Amazon. The purpose of the creation of the department was to give greater political hierarchy to the region as well as to achieve the promotion and demographic and economic growth.  Immigration affair  In June, 1938, the Busch government had announced open immigration into Bolivia in a sudden reversal of previous government policy. On June 9, Julio Salm√≥n, minister of agriculture and immigration, announced the end of special restrictions on Jewish migration. While the motive of this likely had to due with the desire to settle Jews in the Chaco before Paraguay did, it nevertheless made Bolivia the only country in the world at the time which permitted unlimited Jewish migration and went against the strong national socialist and pro-German sympathies of the army. The plan, supported by Moritz Hochschild, known as the \\"Bolivian Schindler,\\" saw 10,000 European Jews set to migrate to Bolivia within a year. Considering the flood of applications, the desperation of those applying, and the lack of profession and low pay of the diplomatic service, abuses inevitably occurred. A scandal arose when it came to light that the consul general in Paris had required that all visas had to be cleared through the embassy which was charging Jewish emigres between ten and twenty thousand francs for a visa. Though many of the persons involved were dismissed, Busch and his government were faced with charges of gross moral violations and government misconduct by the press. = Dictatorship declared = Faced with the immigration scandal, unhappy with the results produced by his few reforms, and with little support from the fractured left, Busch decided a new direction was needed. To the shock of the nation, Busch, tired of the \\"political game\\" and, totally untrained in the art of compromise, declared himself dictator as of April 24, 1939, thus nullifying the very political order he had painstakingly created. The 1938 Constitution, while still in effect, would now be enforced through executive decree as the congress was suspended. In the following months, Germ√°n Busch made the most important changes in his administration. In his four months as dictator, Busch made various attempts to restore the nearly collapsed Bolivian economy by nationalizing the Central Bank of Bolivia and the profits of big mining, and signing into law the first Labor Code of Bolivia; in education, the concept of a unified school was established through a new school code. However, in the last weeks of his life pressure from the media against his government became more severe. The attacks against his leadership included claims ‚Äúthat he was young and inexperienced to govern‚Äù and ‚Äúthat he had neither culture nor knowledge.‚Äù As a measure of Busch's volcanic, unpredictable nature and distaste for the press, he once had Alcides Arguedas, a respected Bolivian diplomat, politician and writer, brought to his office, where he proceeded to physically slap him for a column critical of his regime. Arguedas was 60 years old at the time and Busch 35. Attacks against him were compounded by the powerful elites and tin barons who started a crusade against Busch, after he launched the decree of June 7, 1939 with the label \\"Let Bolivia take advantage of its riches,\\" which ordered the delivery of 100% of the miners' currency to the State. Death and controversy = Apparent suicide = Unable to control events the way he would have liked, and also accompanied by a deep depression possibly worsened by undiagnosed PTSD attributed to his service in the Chaco War, President Busch committed suicide after shooting himself in the right temple in the early hours of August 23, 1939. On the morning of the 23rd, Germ√°n Busch underwent a difficult operation. After nine hours of agony, he died at 2:45 p.m. Though it is suspected by someKurt Riess, Total Espionage, 1941, pp. 247-248 that he may have been murdered, the explanation of suicide is generally accepted. The morning newspaper El Diario of August 24, 1939 published the \\"Exact version of the suicide of Germ√°n Busch, based on the statements of Major Ricardo Goytia, brother-in-law of the president\\": The newspaper La Raz√≥n announces the death of Busch, 24 August, 1939. ‚ÄúOn the night of the 22nd in which they celebrated the birthday of Colonel Eliodoro Carmona (Busch and Goytia's brother-in-law), everything took place in an atmosphere of family cordiality until three in the morning, when the people in attendance had left. It was then that he recalled having left numerous documents on his desk that had to be dispatched and told Carmona and our informant that he wanted to review and sign them. Then, Goytia made him notice that the hour was late and that it would be more convenient for him to go to rest. The president replied, 'Three million Bolivian citizens weigh on my shoulders, I must ensure their well-being and the progress of the country, but in this work misunderstanding, lack of cooperation and the underhanded action of my enemies hinder my work.' [...] At that moment, [...] Goytia noticed that Busch was suffering from one of his nervous breakdowns [...] and saw that he took a pistol from his pants pocket. Then, Goytia took him by the hand and in a fight to prevent him from using it against himself, in which Carmona also participated, the first shot came out of a window. But since the president had extraordinary vigor, he detached himself from both, throwing them away from him, an instant that he took as the opportunity to fire himself the fatal shot in the right storm, immediately falling on the floor of the room.\\" The morning papers La Calle, El Pa√≠s, La Naci√≥n and La Raz√≥n replicated the same hypothesis about suicide. Following the president's death, the more conservative and pro-oligarchic elements in the Bolivian elite reasserted themselves, concluding that reformism had gone entirely too far. Since Busch had proclaimed himself dictator, there was no constitutional succession to speak of, and General Carlos Quintanilla was proclaimed president by the armed forces. Quintanilla was charged with calling new elections and returning matters to the status quo pre-Toro. = Controversy = Luis Toro Ramallo, in his work published in 1940, the year after Busch's death, \\"Busch is dead, who lives now?\\" reported that in those days conjectures about the death of the president circulated throughout the city and that \\"riots and revolutions were announced.\\" On the other hand, they \\"murmured\\" and spoke aloud against the \\"coup leader\\" Quintanilla. In order to reinforce the version of Busch's suicide, the government of Quintanilla issued a statement on August 24 which \\"leaves on record with full evidence that the death of the president is due to an absolutely voluntary act by determination made under the weight of his deep patriotic anguish.\\" On September 28 the autopsy report was delivered which concluded \\"possible suicide.\\" \\"This cannot be affirmed categorically due to the fact that the traces left by a shot at a short distance [...] are not noticeable because the wound has been washed for healing.\\" Later, the final order of the case, issued on October 5, 1939, concluded that ‚ÄúPresident Busch has ended his existence through the violent procedure of suicide [...] at his work desk in his private home, using a Colt 32 revolver.\\" This ruling generated debate. In 1944, Congressman Edmundo Roca and Captain Julio Ponce de Le√≥n named Colonel Carmona as the ‚Äúmain author of Busch's death‚Äù and requested ‚Äúimprisonment while ordinary justice is pronounced again‚Äù. In this way, the investigation was reopened. La Calle reported on August 31, 1944 that these accusations were made due to the ‚Äústatements‚Äù made by Carmona in Charagua. Lieutenant Eufracio Bruno, who would later testify at the trial, said that he asked Carmona \\"Why do public opinion point to you as the author of Busch's death?\\" and that in a drunken state, he replied \\"Yes, I killed him, now what do you want?\\" Bruno also assured that on the birthday of officer Julio Garnica, Carmona confirmed \\"this arm killed Colonel Busch for eighteen thousand dollars.\\" Augusto C√©spedes, in his work \\"The Hanging President\\", stated that ‚ÄúBusch's suicide was so opportune for the large miners that even today it makes us presume a strategic assassination.\\"  Legacy  Currently Germ√°n Busch is considered one of the most enigmatic, heroic and vibrant characters in the entire republican history of Bolivia . Not only because of his participation in the Chaco War, but also because of his short presidential term where he promulgated very important laws, which in the long term, would generate momentous changes, which many years later would influence the National Revolution of 1952. For this reason, President Germ√°n Busch is one of the most honored Bolivian characters in Bolivia. Busch's conflict with Bolivia's mining companies and tin barons was frequently referenced by former President Evo Morales in various tweets. In July, 2019, Morales tweeted \\"In his government, the young patriot faced the mining thread and the social elites that kept the country impoverished. Busch was the manager of military socialism that sought to dignify the country.\\" Colonel Alberto Natusch, who ruled Bolivia for 16 days in December 1979, was Busch's nephew. He had four children, three sons, Germ√°n, Orlando, and Waldo, and one daughter, Gloria who was born after Busch's death in 1940 and is 78 as of June, 2018. = Links to Fascism = Because historically, the Bolivian army contained some German advisers and German-trained soldiers, Busch (of part- German ancestry himself) was suspected to have Nazi tendencies; this was reinforced by the fact that one German officer that served in the Bolivian army during the Chaco War (Major Achim R. von Kries) managed to form the Landesgruppe-Bolivie from the NSDAP-OA in La Paz, along with some other German expatriates. It has also been suggested that German management of the air travel services of the time was indicative of Nazi support. However, Busch strongly denied this, claiming that his regime was \\"uniquely Bolivian.\\" The only known relationship between Busch and the Nazi leaders was a car (a black Mercedes-Benz Cabriolet 770K Series II - W150) sent to him as a present by Adolf Hitler at the beginning of 1939, that Busch never used. In fact, the car remained abandoned in a junkyard until the 1970s, when a private citizen recovered it and restored it. (The car is currently located in San Jose, Costa Rica.)Monument to Germ√°n Busch in La Paz, BoliviaBut there were also incidents such as the execution order for the mining magnate Moritz Hochschild, accused of the trafficking of Bolivian passports within the Jewish community during the Nazi persecutions in Europe. Although it should not be forgotten that Busch himself supported Hoschild's plan to bring 30,000 Jews from Europe to Bolivia. Busch had expected newly immigrated Jews, who often came from European cities, to settle in the countryside as farmers. His disappointment that this did not happen coupled with his animosity towards tin barons like Hochschild are likely the reasons for his ordered execution. Either way, Hochschild would not be shot by pressure even from Busch's cabinet of ministers. = Places and monuments = Various locales in Bolivia were named after him including the Germ√°n Busch Province of the department of Santa Cruz which was created by Law No. 672 of November 30, 1984 during the second government of Hern√°n Siles Suazo. Located in the province of the same name, Puerto Busch is an international river port that is on the international river Paraguay. Puerto Busch, for many decades, was a port project in oblivion, which regained its prominence as a strategic commercial and export zone after the defeat of Bolivia before Chile in the Maritime Demand at the International Court of The Hague. The port is an alternative to a sovereign outlet to the Atlantic Ocean for Bolivia. A monument to Germ√°n Busch is located in the Bolivian capital of La Paz. = Currency and postage = Bolivian currency reform of January 1, 1963 adopted the peso boliviano which featured Busch on its 10 peso note. However, due to inflation which resulted in the effective devaluation of 95%, the peso was replaced by the Bolivian boliviano effective January 1, 1987. Busch does not appear on contemporary currency.

In addition, officeholders are frequently seen as de facto leaders of their political party, eligible to establish policy and administer affairs as they see fit.

In such an area, particularly those that have been gerrymandered, members of the party feel more at ease to challenge current officeholders, because no loss of the seat is expected.

Shade, \\"The Second Party System\\" in Paul Kleppner, et al. Evolution of American Electoral Systems (1983) pp 77-112. The system was characterized by rapidly rising levels of voter interest, beginning in 1828, as demonstrated by Election Day turnouts, rallies, partisan newspapers, and high degrees of personal loyalty to parties.Brown (1999)Wilentz, The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln (2006) Two major parties dominated the political landscape: the Democratic Party, led by Andrew Jackson, and the Whig Party, assembled by Henry Clay from the National Republicans and from other opponents of Jackson. Minor parties included the Anti-Masonic Party, an important innovator from 1827 to 1834; the abolitionist Liberty Party in 1840; and the anti-slavery expansion Free Soil Party in 1848 and 1852. The Second Party System reflected and shaped the political, social, economic and cultural currents of the Jacksonian Era, until succeeded by the Third Party System.Holt, Political Parties and American Political Development: From the Age of Jackson to the Age of Lincoln (1992) Frank Towers specifies an important ideological divide: :Democrats stood for the \\"sovereignty of the people\\" as expressed in popular demonstrations, constitutional conventions, and majority rule as a general principle of governing, whereas Whigs advocated the rule of law, written and unchanging constitutions, and protections for minority interests against majority tyranny.

McCormick is most responsible for defining the term. He concluded:McCormick 1966 pp 14‚Äì16 * It was a distinct party system. * It formed over a 15-year period that varied by state. * It was produced by leaders trying to win the presidency, with contenders building their own national coalitions. * Regional effects strongly affected developments, with the Adams forces strongest in New England, for example, and the Jacksonians in the Southwest. * For the first time two-party politics was extended to the South and West (which had been one-party regions). * In each region the two parties were about equal‚Äîthe first and only party system showing this. * Because of the regional balance it was vulnerable to region-specific issues (like slavery). * The same two parties appeared in every state, and contested both the electoral vote and state offices. * Most critical was the abrupt emergence of a two-party South in 1832-34 (mostly as a reaction against Van Buren). * The Anti-Masonic party flourished in only those states with a weak second party. * Methods varied somewhat but everywhere the political convention replaced the caucus. * The parties had an interest of their own, in terms of the office-seeking goals of party activists. * The System brought forth a new, popular campaign style. * Close elections‚Äînot charismatic candidates or particular issues‚Äîbrought out the voters. * Party leaders formed the parties to some degree in their own image. Leaders Among the best- known figures on the Democratic side were: Andrew Jackson, Martin Van Buren, John C. Calhoun, James K. Polk, Lewis Cass, and Stephen Douglas. On the Whig side were John Quincy Adams, Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, William H. Seward, and Thurlow Weed. According to historian Robert Remini:Robert Remini, \\"Van Buren, Martin\\" in John A. Garraty, ed., Encyclopedia of American Biography (1974) pp 1120-1122. :Van Buren's creative contribution to the political development of the nation was enormous, and as such he earned his way to the presidency. After gaining control of New York's Republican Party he organized the Albany Regency to run the state in his absence while he pursued a national career in Washington. The Regency was a governing consul in Albany consisting of a group of politically astute and highly intelligent men. He was one of the first statewide political machines in the country was success resulted from its professional use of patronage, the legislative caucus, and the official party newspaper.....[In Washington] he labored to bring about the reorganization of the Republican Party through an alliance between what he called \\"the planters of the South and the plain Republicans of the North.\\"... Heretofore parties were regarded as evils to be tolerated; Van Buren argued that the party system was the most sensible and intelligent way the affairs of the nation could be democratically conducted, a viewpoint that eventually won national approval. Origins The 1824 presidential election operated without political parties and came down to a four-man race. Each candidate (Henry Clay, William Crawford, Andrew Jackson, and John Quincy Adams), all of whom were nominally Democratic Republicans, had a regional base of support involving factions in the various states. With no electoral college majority, the choice devolved on the United States House of Representatives. Clay was not among the three finalists, but as Speaker of the House he negotiated the settlement. Jackson, despite having won the most popular votes and the most electoral votes, was not elected. John Quincy Adams, son of former President John Adams, was elected, and he immediately chose Clay as Secretary of State.Lynn H. Parsons, 'The Birth of Modern Politics: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and the Election of 1828 (2009) Jackson loudly denounced this \\"corrupt bargain.\\" Campaigning vigorously he launched a crusade against the corruption he saw in Washington. Appealing both to local militia companies (as the most famous of the nation's Indian fighters, and a hero of the War of 1812) and to state political factions, Jackson assembled a coalition, the embryonic Democratic Party, that ousted Adams in 1828. Martin Van Buren, brilliant leader of New York politics, was Jackson's key aide, bringing along the large electoral votes of Virginia and Pennsylvania. His reward was appointment as Secretary of State and later nomination and election to the vice presidency as heir to the Jacksonian tradition. The Adams-Clay wing of the Democratic-Republican Party became known as the National Republicans, although Adams never considered himself a loyal member of the party. As Norton explains the Jacksonian triumph in 1828: :Jacksonians believed the people's will had finally prevailed. Through a lavishly financed coalition of state parties, political leaders, and newspaper editors, a popular movement had elected the president. The Democrats became the nation's first well-organized national party ... and tight party organization became the hallmark of nineteenth-century American politics.Mary Beth Norton et al., A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877 (Houghton Mifflin, 2007) p 287 Behind the platforms issued by state and national parties stood a widely shared political outlook that characterized the Democrats: :The Democrats represented a wide range of views but shared a fundamental commitment to the Jeffersonian concept of an agrarian society. They viewed the central government as the enemy of individual liberty. The 1824 \\"corrupt bargain\\" had strengthened their suspicion of Washington politics. ... Jacksonians feared the concentration of economic and political power. They believed that government intervention in the economy benefited special-interest groups and created corporate monopolies that favored the rich. They sought to restore the independence of the individual--the artisan and the ordinary farmer--by ending federal support of banks and corporations and restricting the use of paper currency, which they distrusted. Their definition of the proper role of government tended to be negative, and Jackson's political power was largely expressed in negative acts. He exercised the veto more than all previous presidents combined. Jackson and his supporters also opposed reform as a movement. Reformers eager to turn their programs into legislation called for a more active government. But Democrats tended to oppose programs like educational reform and the establishment of a public education system. They believed, for instance, that public schools restricted individual liberty by interfering with parental responsibility and undermined freedom of religion by replacing church schools. Nor did Jackson share reformers' humanitarian concerns. He had no sympathy for American Indians, initiating the removal of the Cherokees along the Trail of Tears.Mary Beth Norton et al., A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877 (2007) pp 287-88Robert Allen Rutland, The Democrats: From Jefferson to Clinton (U. of Missouri Press, 1995) ch 1‚Äì4 Historians have examined the emergence of the Second Party System at the local level. For example, Bruce Bendler argues that in New Jersey the same dramatic changes that were reshaping the rest of the country were especially pointed in that state in the 1820s. A new political system emerged by the end of the decade as voters polarized in support or opposition to Jackson. Furthermore, the \\"Market Revolution\\" was well underway, as industrialization and upgraded transportation networks made the larger picture more important than the local economy, and entrepreneurs and politicians became leaders in speeding up the changes. for example William N. Jeffers of Salem County, New Jersey, build his political success on leadership with the Jacksonian forces at the local level, while at the same time building his fortune with a bank charter and building a steam mill.Bruce A. Bendler, \\"The Steam Mill and Jacksonian Politics: The Career of William N. Jeffers.\\" New Jersey Studies 4.2 (2018): 41-68. online  Jackson: Bank War  Jackson considered himself a reformer, but he was committed to the old ideals of Republicanism, and bitterly opposed anything that smacked of special favors for special interests. While Jackson never engaged in a duel as president, he had shot political opponents before and was just as determined to destroy his enemies on the battlefields of politics. The Second Party System came about primarily because of Jackson's determination to destroy the Second Bank of the United States.Howe, What Hath God Wrought: The Transformation of America, 1815-1848 (2009) Headquartered in Philadelphia, with offices in major cities around the country, the federally chartered Bank operated somewhat like a central bank (like the Federal Reserve System a century later). Local bankers and politicians annoyed by the controls exerted by Nicholas Biddle grumbled loudly. Jackson did not like any banks (paper money was anathema to Jackson; he believed only gold and silver [\\"specie\\"] should circulate.) After Herculean battles with Henry Clay, his chief antagonist, Jackson finally broke Biddle's bank. Jackson continued to attack the banking system. His Specie Circular of July 1836 rejected paper money issued by banks (it could no longer be used to buy federal land), insisting on gold and silver coins. Most businessmen and bankers (but not all) went over to the Whig party, and the commercial and industrial cities became Whig strongholds. Jackson meanwhile became even more popular with the subsistence farmers and day laborers who distrusted bankers and finance. Economic historians have explored the high degree of financial and economic instability in the Jacksonian era. For the most part, they follow the conclusions of Peter Temin, who absolved Jackson's policies, and blamed international events beyond American control, such as conditions in Mexico, China and Britain. A survey of economic historians in 1995 show that the vast majority concur with Temin's conclusion that \\"the inflation and financial crisis of the 1830s had their origin in events largely beyond President Jackson's control and would have taken place whether or not he had acted as he did vis-a-vis the Second Bank of the U.S.\\"Robert Whaples, \\"Were Andrew Jackson's Policies 'Good for the Economy'?\\" Independent Review (2014) 18#4 online =Spoils System= Jackson systematically used the federal patronage system, what was called the Spoils System. Jackson not only rewarded past supporters; he promised future jobs if local and state politicians joined his team. As Syrett explains: When Jackson became President, he implemented the theory of rotation in office, declaring it \\"a leading principle in the republican creed.\\" He believed that rotation in office would prevent the development of a corrupt civil service. On the other hand, Jackson's supporters wanted to use the civil service to reward party loyalists to make the party stronger. In practice, this meant replacing civil servants with friends or party loyalists into those offices. The spoils system did not originate with Jackson. It originated under Thomas Jefferson when he removed Federalist office-holders after becoming president.The Spoils System versus the Merit System. Retrieved on 2006-11-21. Also, Jackson did not out the entire civil service. At the end of his term, Jackson had only dismissed less than twenty percent of the original civil service.Jacksonian Democracy: The Presidency of Andrew Jackson . Retrieved on 2006-11-21. While Jackson did not start the spoils system, he did encourage its growth and it became a central feature of the Second Party System, as well as the Third Party System, until it ended in the 1890s. As one historian explains: > \\"Although Jackson dismissed far fewer government employees than most of his > contemporaries imagined and although he did not originate the spoils system, > he made more sweeping changes in the Federal bureaucracy than had any of his > predecessors. What is even more significant is that he defended these > changes as a positive good. At present when the use of political patronage > is generally considered an obstacle to good government, it is worth > remembering that Jackson and his followers invariably described rotation in > public office as a \\"reform.\\" In this sense the spoils system was more than a > way to reward Jackson's friends and punish his enemies; it was also a device > for removing from public office the representatives of minority political > groups that Jackson insisted had been made corrupt by their long > tenure.\\"Syrett, 28. Modernizing Whigs Both parties having a common ancestor, the Whigs and Democrats agreed on many basic principles‚Äîthey were both strongly committed to the ideals of Republicanism in the United States. In most of the United States, the Whigs were more upscale, better educated, more urban, and more entrepreneurial; the Democrats were strongest on the frontier and in subsistence farming areas. Catholic immigrants, especially Irish and German, were heavily and enthusiastically Democratic, while evangelical Protestants and English and Scots-Irish immigrants were typically Whigs. As Norton explains, there were major policy differences: : Whigs favored economic expansion through an activist government, Democrats through limited central government. Whigs supported corporate charters, a national bank, and paper currency; Democrats were opposed to all three. Whigs also favored more humanitarian reforms than did Democrats, including public schools, abolition of capital punishment, prison and asylum reform and temperance. Whigs were more optimistic than Democrats, generally speaking, and more enterprising. They did not object to helping a specific group if doing so would promote the general welfare. The chartering of corporations, they argued, expanded economic opportunity for everyone, laborers and farmers alike. Democrats, distrustful of concentrated economic power and of moral and economic coercion, held fast to the Jeffersonian principle of limited government.Mary Beth Norton et al., A People and a Nation, Volume I: to 1877 (2007) pp 293-94 Meanwhile, economic modernizers, bankers, businessmen, commercial farmers, many of whom were already National Republicans, and Southern planters angry at Jackson's handling of the Nullification crisis were mobilized into a new anti-Jackson force; they called themselves Whigs. Just as the Whigs of 1776 were patriots who battled the tyranny of King George III, so too the new party saw itself battling \\"King Andrew\\".Mary Beth Norton et al., \\"The Whig Challenge and the Second Party System,\\", in A People and a Nation (8th ed. 2008), ch 12 In the northeast, a moralistic crusade against the highly secretive Masonic order matured into a regular political party, the Anti-Masons, which soon combined with the Whigs. Jackson fought back by aggressive use of federal patronage, by timely alliances with local leaders, and with a rhetoric that identified the Bank and its agents as the greatest threat to the republican spirit. Eventually his partisans called themselves \\"Democrats.\\" The Whigs had an elaborate program for modernizing the economy. To stimulate the creation of new factories, they proposed a high tariff on imported manufactured goods. The Democrats said that would fatten the rich; the tariff should be low‚Äîfor \\"revenue only\\" (thus not to foster manufacturing). Whigs argued that banks and paper money were needed; the Democrats countered that no honest man wants them. Public works programs to build roads, canals and railroads would give the country the infrastructure it needed for rapid economic development, said the Whigs. Democrats replied they did not want that kind of complex change. Rather the Democrats called for more of the same‚Äîespecially more farms to raise the families in the traditional style. More land is needed for that, Democrats said, so they pushed for expansion south and west. Jackson conquered Florida for the US. Over intense Whig opposition, his political heir, James Polk (1844‚Äì48) added Texas, the Southwest, California, and Oregon. Next on the Democratic agenda would be Cuba.Wilentz, The Rise of American Democracy: Jefferson to Lincoln (2005) In most cities the rich men were solidly Whig‚Äî85-90% of the men worth over $100,000 in Boston and New York City voted Whig.Watson (1990) p, 236 In rural America, the Whigs were stronger in market towns and commercial areas, and the Democrats stronger on the frontier and in more isolated areas. Ethnic and religious communities usually went the same way, with Irish and German Catholics heavily Democratic, and pietistic Protestants more Whiggish.Watson (1990) p, 236-7 Democratization Gienapp (1982) points out that the American political system underwent fundamental change after 1820 under the rubric of Jacksonian Democracy. While Jackson himself did not initiate the changes, he took advantage in 1828 and symbolized many of the changes. For the first time politics assumed a central role in voters' lives. Before then deference to upper class elites, and general indifference most of the time, characterized local politics across the country. The suffrage laws were not at fault for they allowed mass participation; rather few men were interested in politics before 1828, and fewer still voted or became engaged because politics did not seem important. Changes followed the psychological shock of the panic of 1819, and the 1828 election of Andrew Jackson, with his charismatic personality and controversial policies. By 1840, Gienapp argues, the revolution was complete: \\"With the full establishment of the second party system, campaigns were characterized by appeals to the common man, mass meetings, parades, celebrations, and intense enthusiasm, while elections generated high voter participation. In structure and ideology, American politics had been democratized.\\"Gienapp ed (1982) p 15 Party strategies Both parties relied heavily on their national network of newspapers. Some editors were the key political players in their states, and most of them filled their papers with useful information on rallies and speeches and candidates, as well as the text of major speeches and campaign platforms. =Party strengths= The Whigs built a strong party organization in most states; they were weak only on the frontier. They were strongest in Northeast and among business, merchants, commercial farmers, professionals. The Whigs used newspapers effectively, and soon adopted the exciting campaign techniques that lured 75 to 85% of the eligible voters to the polls. Abraham Lincoln emerged early as the leader in Illinois‚Äîwhere he usually was bested by an even more talented politician, Stephen Douglas. While Douglas and the Democrats were somewhat behind the Whigs in newspaper work, they made up for this weakness by emphasis on party loyalty. Anyone who attended a Democratic convention, from precinct level to national level, was honor bound to support the final candidate, whether he liked him or not. This rule produced numerous schisms, but on the whole the Democrats controlled and mobilized their rank and file more effectively than the Whigs did. =Whig weaknesses= Democratic poster in 1840 warning that Whigs' Log Cabin campaign was a trap for poor people One fundamental weakness was its inability to take a position on slavery. As a coalition of Northern National Republicans and Southern Nullifiers, Whigs in each of the two regions held opposing views on slavery. Therefore, the Whig party was only able to conduct successful campaigns as long as the slavery issue was ignored.Watson, Liberty and Power: The Politics of Jacksonian America (1990) By the mid-1850s, the question of slavery dominated the political landscape, and the Whigs, unable to agree on an approach to the issue, began to disintegrate. A few Whigs lingered, claiming that, with the alternatives being a pro-Northern Republican party and a pro- Southern Democratic party, they were the only political party that could preserve the Union. In 1856, the remaining Whigs endorsed the Know-Nothing campaign of Millard Fillmore and in 1860 they endorsed the Constitutional Union ticket of John Bell, but, with the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861, the Whig party ceased to exist. Most of the prominent men in most towns and cities were Whigs, and they controlled local offices and judgeships, in addition to many state offices. Thus the outcome of the political process was mixed. In Springfield, Illinois, a strong Whig enclave in a Democratic region, poll books that show how individuals voted indicates the rise of the Whigs took place in 1836 in opposition to the presidential candidacy of Martin Van Buren and was consolidated in 1840. Springfield Whigs tend to validate historical studies elsewhere: they were largely native-born, either in New England or Kentucky, professional men or farm owners, and devoted to partisan organization. Abraham Lincoln's career mirrors the Whigs' political rise, but by the 1840s Springfield began to fall into the hands of the Democrats, as immigrants changed the city's political makeup. By the 1860 presidential election, Lincoln was barely able to win the city.Winkle (1998) =Democrats dominant in 1852= By the 1850s most Democratic party leaders had accepted many Whiggish ideas, and no one could deny the economic modernization of factories and railroads was moving ahead rapidly. The old economic issues died about the same time old leaders like Calhoun, Webster, Clay, Jackson and Polk passed from the scene. New issues, especially the questions of slavery, nativism and religion came to the fore. 1852 was the last hurrah for the Whigs; everyone realized they could win only if the Democrats split in two. With the healing of the Free Soil revolt after 1852, Democratic dominance seemed assured. The Whigs went through the motions, but both rank and file and leaders quietly dropped out. The Third Party System was ready to emerge.

There is no \\"standard\\" size of bigha. The size of a bigha varies considerably from place to place. The size of Bigha is different in different areas.Haryana jamabandi Units of measurements , HALRIS. Sources have given measurements ranging from , but in several smaller pockets, it can be as high as . Its sub-unit is Biswa (or Bisa) or Katha (or Katta) in many regions. Again there is no \\"standard\\" size of biswa or katha. A bigha may have 5 to 200 biswa in different regions. Now 2020  Uses in India  The bigha is a traditional unit of land in several parts of South Asia. Sale and purchase of land (particularly agricultural land) is still done unofficially in this unit. However, the area is recorded in hectare or square metres in official land records. Bigha varies in size from one part of India to another. Various states and often regions within the same state have different sizes attributed to the bigha. It is usually less than one standard acre (43,560 square feet or 4,047 square metre) but can extend up to 3 acres (1.2 hectare). * In Assam, a bigha is , subdivided into 5 katha. Each katha consists of 20 Lessa with a Lessa covering in area. Hence each katha is in area, although this may vary within different regions of Assam. 4 bighas together are further termed as a Pura. * In Bihar, different regions have different sizes of bigha. Near the capital, Patna, one bigha is equivalent to 20 katha. 1 Katha equating to . One katha is further subdivided in 20 dhur. Hence each dhur is approximately . One dhur is further subdivided in 20 dhurki, each dhurki being approximately . ** 1 decimal in Bihar equals to 435.56 sq feet. 1 decimal is equal to 1/100 acre. ** In some of eastern parts of the Bihar including Munger, Bhagalpur and Jamui, one dhur is further subdivided into one square lagga (pole length). One lagga is equivalent to 5.5 hand lengths, with each hand length being . Therefore, one lagga is 99 inches, or 251.46 cm. * In Himachal Pradesh, five bigha is equal to one acre (0.0809 hectare). * In Punjab and Haryana, 4.8 bigha is equal to one acre, each bigha is 4 kanaals, each kanaal is 20 marlas, each marla is 9 square karam, each square karam is 30.25 sq ft (5.5 X 5.5 ft), each karam is 5.5 feet. See measurement of land in Punjab. * In central India, bighas were standardized at 3025 yd2(2529.3 m2) or 5/8 acre (0.2529 hectare). * In Madhya Pradesh, one Katha = . * In Rajasthan, One Pucca Bigha = 27,225 sq ft and one Kaccha Bigha is equal to . * In Uttar Pradesh, one bigha can mean different things to people in different districts of the state. In the western districts of the state one bigha is either equal to five biswa (one biswa is or 6.75 biswa. In the remainder of Uttar Pradesh, 1 bigha is divided into 20 biswas. Each biswa is 125 m2 or 154.32 yd2 (hence one Bigha is 0.25 Hectare (or 2500 m2 or 3086.4 yd2 or 26909 ft2). 6 Biswa ‚âà1 Bigha (Kaccha) * In Uttar Pradesh East one Bigha equals to 20 Biswa(Pakka) and 10 Biswa(kaccha).

In metric units, a bigha is hence 1333 m2. *However in Tamil Nadu, Bigha is not in practical measurement unit.  Uses in Bangladesh  Bigha is a traditional unit of land in entire Bangladesh, with land purchases still being undertaken in this unit. One bigha is equal to 1,600 square yard as standardized in pre-partition Bengal during the British rule. In other words, 3 bigha are just 60.5 katha/360 sq ft short of 1 acre.

Officially, most measurement of lands use units of either Bigha (in Terai region) or Ropani (Nepali: ‡§∞‡•ã‡§™‡§®‡•Ä) (in Hilly regions).

This is in contrast to setting it off with quotation marks in a run-in quote. Block quotations are used for long quotations. The Chicago Manual of Style recommends using a block quotation when extracted text is 100 words or more, or approximately six to eight lines in a typical manuscript.  Origins In the first centuries of typesetting, quotations were distinguished merely by indicating the speaker, and this can still be seen on some editions of the Bible. During the Renaissance, quotations were distinguished by setting in a typeface contrasting with the main body text (often Italic type with roman, or the other way round). Block quotations were set this way at full size and full measure. Quotation marks were first cut in type during the middle of the sixteenth century, and were used copiously by some printers by the seventeenth. In Baroque and Romantic- period books, they could be repeated at the beginning of every line of a long quotation. When this practice was abandoned, the empty margin remained, leaving an indented block quotation.Bringhurst (2002), p. 86. Formatting Apart from quotation marks not being used to enclose block quotations, there are no hard-and-fast rules for the exact formatting of block quotations. To a large extent the specific format may be dictated by the method of publication (e.g. handwritten text, typewritten pages, or electronic publishing) as well as the typeface being used. For writers and editors, The Chicago Manual of Style (8th edition, 2007) recommends using a block quotation when cited text is five lines or longer.University of Chicago (2007). The Chicago Manual of Style (8th ed.). Chicago: University of Chicago Press. . Other sources set the threshold at four or five lines.How and When to Use Block Quotes The block quotation may also be used to distinguish shorter citations from original text, though strictly speaking this does not follow APA or MLA style guidelines. Use of the block quotation for shorter passages is a stylistic choice that may or may not be acceptable depending on the situation. Some guidelines suggest an indentation of five, ten, or fifteen spaces. However, five spaces in a proportional font may be much narrower than in a typewriter font of the same point size. In addition, setting an indent based on an exact number of spaces may not be technically possible in a given word processing or electronic publishing application. In these situations, a measurement of distance rather than a number of spaces may be prescribed instead (for example, a to 1 in or 1 to 2 cm indent). Some writers indent block quotations from the right margin as well. Block quotations are generally set off from the text that precedes and follows them by also adding extra space above and below the quotation and setting the text in smaller type. Barring specific requirements, the format of the block quotation will ultimately be determined by aesthetics, making the quotation pleasing to the eye, easy to read, and appropriate for the particular writing task. In typesetting, block quotations can be distinguished from the surrounding text by variation in typeface (often italic vs. roman), type size, or by indentation. Often combinations of these methods are used, but are not necessary. Block quotations are also visually distinguished from preceding and following main text blocks by a white line or half-line space.Bringhurst (2002), pp. 40‚Äì41.

History Facing Reality originated in the Johnson- Forest Tendency led by C. L. R. James and Raya Dunayevskaya. It has its origins in the Trotskyist left but regarded the Soviet Union as state capitalist. By 1951, the Johnson-Forest Tendency had left the Trotskyist left to form its own organization known as Correspondence Publishing Committee. C. L. R. James was forced to leave the USA in the early 1950s and Correspondence split. The faction that stayed loyal to C .L. R. James retained the name the Correspondence Publishing Committee and continued to receive advice from James from Britain, while a significant number supported Raya Dunayevskaya and split to form a new group, News and Letters Committees, which publishes a monthly newspaper, News & Letters, that remains in print today. In 1962, there was a further split as Grace Lee Boggs, James Boggs, Freddy Paine and Lyman Paine abandoned the politics of C.L.R. James for an eclectic politics that was third worldist, while keeping the organization's name. The small number of members that continued to endorse the politics of James took the name Facing Reality, after the 1958 book by James co-written with Grace Lee Boggs and Pierre Chaulieu, a pseudonym for Cornelius Castoriadis, on the Hungarian working class revolt of 1956. Facing Reality was based primarily in Detroit and published a monthly newsletter, Speak Out, as well as pamphlets by James and other leading Facing Reality figures such as Martin Glaberman. They include Negro Americans Take the Lead: A Statement on the Crisis in American Civilization in 1964 and Mao as Dialectician by Martin Glaberman as well as James' Marxism and the Intellectuals in 1963 and Lenin, Trotsky, and the Vanguard Party in 1964. In 1967, four key leading members ‚Äî C.L.R. James, Martin Glaberman, William Gorman and George Rawick ‚Äî of Facing Reality collaborated to write the pamphlet The Gathering Forces, a document some such as Kent Worcester have characterized as representing the influence of Maoism even in Facing Reality. Martin Glaberman, however, has disputed this claim in a review of Worcester's book in Against the Current magazine. Political impact Facing Reality had a particular, if small, impact among African American political activists at Wayne State University in Detroit and in auto plants in the city. A community paper, Inner City Voice, published articles by James in the late 1960s. Glaberman taught a class on Karl Marx's Capital to many of the staff of the Inner City Voice. Numerous members of this group were also active in the Dodge Revolutionary Union Movement. In 1970, the group was dissolved at the suggestion of Glaberman over James's objections on the ground that it was too small to have an impact. It is important to note, however that the group had a broader international influence as well, including in Italy's burgeoning \\"autonomous\\" communist movement.

Agastache is a genus of aromatic flowering herbaceous perennial plants in the family Lamiaceae. It contains 22 species, mainly native to North America, one species native to eastern Asia. The common names of the species are a variety of fairly ambiguous and confusing \\"hyssops\\" and \\"mints\\"; as a whole the genus is known as giant hyssops or hummingbird mints. Most species are very upright, 0.5‚Äì3 m tall, with stiff, angular stems clothed in toothed-edged, lance shaped leaves ranging from 1‚Äì15 cm long and 0.5‚Äì11 cm broad depending on the species. Upright spikes of tubular, two- lipped flowers develop at the stem tips in summer. The flowers are usually white, pink, mauve, or purple, with the bracts that back the flowers being of the same or a slightly contrasting color. Systematics and taxonomy Agastache derives from the Ancient Greek words () \\"very much\\" and () \\"ear of grain\\", and describing the flower spikes. The genus was established in 1762 by Jan Frederik Gronovius in the second edition of his controversial Flora Virginica, based on the specimens and notes of John Clayton. It is a member of subfamily Nepetoideae, which contains a large proportion of the world's aromatic culinary herbs. Within its subfamily, it belongs to the mint tribe (Mentheae), and therein to the catmint subtribeFormerly treated as tribe Nepeteae: Sanders (1987). (Nepetinae). The Nepetinae are robustly supported by cladistic analyses of morphological and DNA sequence data, and were recognized as early as the mid-late 19th century.Sanders, Roger W. (1987): Taxonomy of Agastache Section Brittonastrum (Lamiaceae-Nepeteae). Syst. Bot. Monogr. 15: 1-92.

Agastache nepetoides anatomy; note the curving stamen stalks typical of Agastache sect. Agastache The closest living relatives of Agastache are believed to be two very different lineages: One is a group of mostly Asian and usually strongly aromatic and rather robust plants, which contains the typical dragonheads (Dracocephalum), true hyssops (Hyssopus), West Asian dragonheads (Lallemantia), and Japanese catnip (Schizonepeta). By contrast, the other lineage unites the largely scentless and low-growing genera Glechoma and Meehania which occur widely across the Holarctic. These three lineages form a tight-knit radiation; as of 2016, it is not resolved with certainty which of the other two lineages is the sister taxon of Agastache, but most data place the aromatic group slightly closer. The genus Agastache seems to have originated as a North American/trans-Beringian offshoot of its radiation about 25 million years ago, in the Late Oligocene.Drew, Bryan T. & Sytsma, Kennet J. (2012): Phylogenetics, biogeography, and staminal evolution in the tribe Mentheae (Lamiaceae). Am. J. Bot. 99(5): 933‚Äì953. PDF fulltextDeng, Tao et al. (2015): Does the Arcto-Tertiary Biogeographic Hypothesis Explain the Disjunct Distribution of Northern Hemisphere Herbaceous Plants? The Case of Meehania (Lamiaceae). PLOS ONE 10(2): e0117171. (Fulltext) The sister group of this clade is the core of the Nepetinae, the more or less robust and typically aromatic catmints (Nepeta) and their close relativesDrepanocaryum, Hymenocrater, Lophanthus, Marmoritis: Drew & Sytsma (2012). which occur mainly in and around western Asia. The monotypic and highly distinct Cedronella (Canary balm) of Macaronesia is slightly more distant and seems to be a basal relict within the subtribe. Thus, the last common ancestor of Agastache and its closest relatives probably was an aromatic Eastern Asian perennial or subshrub with verticillasters of bluish-purple flowers - i.e. generally very similar to the present-day Agastache already. The plesiomorphic appearance of Agastache is underscored by the fact that some of its species were formerly placed in Lophanthus and even Cedronella; essentially, the genus as recognized today was distributed piecemeal across the entire Nepetinae. In general, the evolutionary pattern of the subtribe is a mostly eastward expansion from an origin in the southern or the eastern Mediterranean region, which spread across much of the Old World and with three genera reached North America. Agastache is divided into two sections, sect. Agastache and sect. Brittonastrum. The former occurs in and around western to central North America, extending across the Bering Strait into East Asia. It is characterized by the upper lip of the corolla being small, causing the stalks of the stamina to protrude widely. Furthermore, two of the four stamina have curving stalks, which cross those of the other pair. Section Brittonastrum is found in and around southwestern North America, with the highest diversity in the uplands of northern Mexico. Its members have a more well-developed upper corolla lip, under which the stamina run parallel to each other without crossing, and are entirely hidden from view or only protrude with the anthers and stalk tips. Cultivation and uses They are easily grown in moist, well- drained soil and prefer a sunny position. Winter hardiness varies; the hardiest is A. foeniculum, hardy to USDA plant hardiness zone 1 in the north of its range; A. nepetoides, A. rugosa, A. scrophulariifolia and A. urticifolia are hardy to zones 3‚Äì5 in the northern parts of their ranges. Propagate from seed or cuttings. Popular cultivars include A. cana 'Heather Queen'. The cultivar 'Blue Fortune' has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit. Leaf tips can be eaten and made into teas. Agastache rugosa has a history of use in Chinese herbology. Species The sections with their species are: ;Agastache sect.

Kreutzer Jr. (born 1969) is a former United States Army soldier who was convicted of killing one officer and wounding 18 other soldiers when he opened fire on a physical training formation on October 27, 1995 at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. Kreutzer was sentenced to death, but his sentence was later commuted to life in prison by the Army Court of Criminal Appeals in connection with concerns regarding mental illness. Biography At trial, Kreutzer's high school vice principal Ms. Witczak testified that he was an \\"above average\\" student. He graduated from the University of Maryland. At the time of the shootings, Kreutzer's father was facing criminal charges for sex crimes against a teenage girl a decade earlier. Kreutzer entered the Army in February 1992. By March 1993, Kreutzer was assigned to the 325th Airborne Infantry Regiment of the 82nd Airborne Division, and the following January followed the unit to deployment in the Sinai. During his time in the military, Kreutzer reported being the butt of practical jokes and teasing from fellow soldiers. In the past, Kreutzer had reportedly told a friend that he knew what the record number of people killed in a rampage shooting was, and earned himself the nickname \\"Crazy Kreutzer\\". In June 1994, Kreutzer broke down in tears while on guard duty in the Sinai, and spoke of killing several other soldiers. He was disciplined and sent to see the division's social worker, Darren Fong, who said he suffered from low self-esteem and anger management problems. He was deemed to not be a threat, but was disallowed weapons for two weeks following the incident. In October 1994, Kreutzer attended the Primary Leadership Development Course to become a non-commissioned officer, and was promoted to the rank of sergeant. The shooting Kreutzer in 1992 The day before the shooting, Kreutzer confided in his former roommate Spc. Robert Harlan that he needed to talk to Fong again. When Harlan tried to calm him down, he replied \\"No, Harlan, it's not going to be all right.\\" After the discussion, Kreutzer telephoned Spc. Burl Mays to inform him that he would be opening fire on the calisthenics field the next morning. Mays noticed Kreutzer missing at 5 am, and alerted his superiors who dismissed the claim, saying that Kreutzer was a \\"pussy\\", but gave Mays permission to check Kreutzer's room, where he found a copy of his will. Early on the morning of 27 October 1995, Kreutzer hid in a tree line, adjacent to a housing area, alongside Towle Stadium APF field, and opened fire on his brigade formation assembled in the stadium, wounding 18 soldiers with a 5.56√ó45mm NATO AR-15 and a .22 LR; he was also armed with a Browning Hi-Power 9mm semi-automatic pistol and a Spyderco folding knife. Several Special Forces soldiers, including SFC Tony Minor, SFC Bob Howes, SGT Edward Mongold, and SFC Paul Rogers were conducting a physical training run when they observed gunfire erupt from Towle Stadium. They took cover in the woods between the stadium and Bastogne Dr., which placed them behind Kreutzer during the shooting, before several unarmed members of 325th Airborne Brigade Staff, led by the Regimental XO LTC Mike Kerrigan, hastily assaulted frontally into the position Kreutzer was firing from, forcing him to move several times and retreat into the woods. In the midst of this, Kreutzer shot Major Stephen Badger (Regimental S2) and Major Guy Lo Faro (Regimental Adjutant) with the rifle as the Brigade Staff assaulted into and pursued him, killing Major Badger instantly with a shot to the head as CPT Cole Bricker (Brigade S3 Battle Captain) and 1LT George Lewis (Assistant Regimental S2) closed in from the right side of the Brigade Staff assault line while Kreutzer fled through the woods. When Kreutzer turned to open fire on them, he was tackled to the ground by two of the SF soldiers who had sought cover in the woods but suddenly found Kreutzer in the middle of their hiding position. CPT Bricker and 1LT Lewis assisted them, and after a struggle with Kreutzer, disarmed him. Afterwards, they escorted Kreutzer from the woods to a position near Bastogne Rd., where armed Military Police took him into custody. Several SF soldiers were awarded the Soldier's Medal, including as were Majors Badger (posthumously) and Lo Faro. After the shootings After arriving at the Criminal Investigation Division office, Kreutzer waived his rights and again asked to speak with Fong, who had since been reassigned. A psychiatrist, Dr. Diamond, was provided instead, since Kreutzer had invoked his right to silence and an attorney and refused to speak to the military police. Diamond interviewed Kreutzer and reported that he seemed delusional and severely distraught. The following day, Lt. Cmdr Messer (also a doctor of psychiatry) performed a suicide assessment, and declared that there were \\"definite mental health issues\\" involved. The following week, Kreutzer asked to speak to a private civilian psychiatrist, for which he would pay. Dr. Rollins attended Kreutzer until he was unable to continue paying the psychiatric bills. On December 8, a board of doctors from the military hospital deemed Kreutzer mentally fit to stand trial. Colonel Peter Brownback presided over the trial. During the trial, Kreutzer claimed, \\"I wanted to send a message to the chain- of-command that had forgotten the welfare of the common soldier.\\" Kreutzer was assigned as prisoner 76651-95-01 on the US Military's death row at the United States Disciplinary Barracks Fort Leavenworth. Colonel James Currie of the Army Court of Criminal Appeals commuted Kreutzer's death sentence, citing that his lawyer had not properly informed the courts of his client's mental illnesses. Colonel Michael Chapman participated as one of the appellate judges who heard the appeal. On March 10, 2009, Kreutzer re-pleaded guilty to one count of premeditated murder and attempted premeditated murder and 16 counts of aggravated assault. The plea deal will spare him the death penalty, and he now faces up to life in prison. Military justice, as a rule, does provide for parole of prisoners, though it is unclear whether Kreutzer will qualify for parole within his natural life span. On March 24, 2009, after a trial at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, Kreutzer was convicted of one specification of premeditated murder, 18 specifications of attempted murder, one specification of violating a general order by transporting weapons on post, and one specification of larceny of government property (theft of government ammunition). Prior to his sentencing, Kreutzer stood at attention while a member of his defense team read his unsworn statement to members of the court: > To each and every person that I hurt directly by shooting them; and to each > and every person affected by my actions, whether it be a family member, > loved one, co-worker, neighbor or friend - I offer my most heartfelt, > sincere apology to each of you ... Words are inadequate to express the deep > sense of shame and remorse that I feel for the harm that I caused. I > apologize and am deeply sorry for what I have done. According to the Army News Service, in Kreutzer's unsworn statement he closed with saying he can't change the past, so his heartfelt and sincere desire was to provide any measure of help, closure, and comfort he can to all of his victims. Another member of Kreutzer's defense team made brief remarks, suggesting clemency in the sentencing since Kreutzer had been a role model prisoner for the past 13 years. Colonel Patrick Parrish, the military judge at Fort Bragg, then ruled that in addition to life in prison, Kreutzer should be reduced in rank to E-1, forfeit pay and allowances, and be given a dishonorable discharge. Charges Kreutzer pleaded guilty to 20 counts: *The premeditated murder of Maj Stephen Badger, *17 counts of attempted premeditated murder, *One count of violating a lawful general regulation, and *One count of larceny of Government munitions. Four counts of maiming, and 17 of 18 charges of aggravated assault against him, were superseded by his pleas of guilty of attempted murder. The charge of aggravated assault related to Staff Sgt. Robert Howes, who was shot in the foot during the struggle to disarm Kreutzer, was dropped in exchange for the rest of the guilty pleas.

Pensacola Bay (map center) is southeast of Pensacola, Florida, by Escambia Bay. Location of Pensacola Bay (top left) in the state of Florida. Pensacola Bay is a bay located in the northwestern part of Florida, United States, known as the Florida Panhandle. The bay, an inlet of the Gulf of Mexico, is located in Escambia County and Santa Rosa County, adjacent to the city of Pensacola, Florida, and is about 13 miles (21 km) long and 2.5 miles (4 km) wide. The Pensacola Bay estuarine system including Escambia Bay, Pensacola Bay, Blackwater Bay, East Bay, and Santa Rosa Sound, and four rivers‚Äîthe Escambia,‚Äô Blackwater,‚Äô Yellow and East Rivers is 144 square miles, and it is the fourth largest estuarine system in Florida.https://www.escambiaclerk.com/clerk/forms/grandjuryreports/1999/appendix1.pdf Pensacola Bay is formed and protected by Fairpoint Peninsula and the barrier island of Santa Rosa. The Pensacola Bay Bridge crosses the bay, connecting Pensacola to Gulf Breeze on the western end of the peninsula. The Gulf Islands National Seashore includes Santa Rosa Island, and encloses part of the bay. The Gulf Intracoastal Waterway runs through a section of the bay. Pensacola Bay leads into Escambia Bay to the north, and to the East Bay. Pensacola Pass connects the Bay to the Gulf of Mexico.  History  After the War of 1812, the federal government decided to fortify Pensacola and Pensacola Bay. It built the Navy Yard west of the city in Warrington, starting in 1828 (this was redeveloped in the 20th century as Naval Air Station Pensacola). It completed construction of Fort Pickens in 1834 at the western end of Santa Rosa Island; completed Fort McRee in 1839, and completed redesign and expansion of Fort Barrancas in 1844, to add to defenses. 2010 Gulf oil spill Following the Deepwater Horizon oil spill (called the \\"Gulf oil spill\\"), the government and BP planned to close the entrance to Pensacola Pass with a floating barrier system in June 2010, to control tidal flow of oil entering from the Gulf of Mexico.DH-27 \\"Unified Command for the BP Oil Spill  Pensacola Pass to Close\\", Deepwater Horizon Response website. The daily high tide was causing oil- contaminated water to enter Pensacola Bay. Such a barrier system is designed to allow boats to travel through Pensacola Pass during the outflowing tide, but to close during the rising tide. The booming plan was never carried out.

The film was produced as a \\"backdoor pilot\\" for an unproduced television series of the same name.https://www.imdb.com/news/ni0195715/ It is based on Casual Rex, the 2002 prequel to the 2000 novel of the same name by Eric Garcia. It was aired on Sci Fi Channel. Plot In an alternate timeline, dinosaurs have managed to survive the KT Extinction Event and now live amongst humans using disguises. Vincent Rubio is a Velociraptor private investigator along with his partner, Ernie Watson, a Triceratops. When Ernie's ex-girlfriend's brother is found dead, the incident is dismissed as suicide. However she doesn't believe her brother would kill himself and asks Ernie to investigate (\\"for free,\\" Vincent observes). When the pair investigate the crime scene, Vincent notices the scent of another dinosaur on the windowsill, concluding it was not a suicide. At the funeral Vincent talks to a man dressed in a strange suit who belongs to the cult that the deceased had previously joined, \\"The Voice of Progress.\\" He pretends to be interested in their ideals and gets himself and Ernie invited to a gathering. During the funeral, Vincent detects the same scent from the victim's bedroom, indicating the killer is nearby. Vincent and Ernie go to the cult meeting where they are told the Voice of Progress' ideals and history: The Voice of Progress is revealed to be both the title of their leader and a collection of dinosaurs who believe that the prolonged use of disguises has robbed the dinosaur community of its unique identity. The cult also believes that humans have caused dinosaurs to see themselves as monsters and humans as normal. While Ernie appears indifferent to the cult's ideals, Vincent is profoundly impacted by the cult's beliefs. As their investigation continues, Vincent and Ernie come to realize what one man in the cult is planning a dinosaurian revolution by turning cult members into violent, feral dinosaurs and releasing them on the humans. The resulting conflict will force both sides to face each other, and allow dinosaurs to reveal themselves. Though Vincent is somewhat sympathetic to the cult, he disagrees with the idea of a violent revolution (knowing it could end in disaster for both sides), leaving him unsure which side he's on.

He is best known for his service for 15 years as honorary President of the National Gallery of Victoria, and 15 years honorary Presidency of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. He was also involved in the trial known as the JetCorp fiasco. Family background Andrew Grimwade is the son of Frederick Sheppard Grimwade, great-grandson of Frederick Sheppard Grimwade (founder of the Grimwade family fortune in Australia), and great- great-grandson of Edward Grimwade of Grimwade & Ridley & Company, London. As pioneers of the pharmaceutical industry in Victoria, the Grimwade family established the glass industry, the sulphuric acid and super phosphate industries, and later the industrial gases industry. Following various mergers, purchases, and spin-offs, the firms founded or co-founded by Frederick Sheppard Grimwade became Felton Grimwade & Bickford (manufacturers of Bosisto's Eucalyptus Oil), Drug Houses of Australia Ltd and Australian Consolidated Industries Ltd. Andrew Grimwade's father, Frederick Sheppard Grimwade, died when Andrew was 19. Andrew Grimwade's brother, the Honourable Frederick Sheppard Grimwade, served for many years as President of the Legislative Council of Victoria. Business career Grimwade was trained as a chemical engineer (University of Melbourne) and as a scientist (Oxford University). His early business career was in Sydney where he was appointed to the board of Commonwealth Industrial Gases. Aged in his mid-thirties, he was the youngest director of the National Australia Bank, Chief Executive of CARBA and a director of the National Mutual Life Association. He also ran a small merchant banking company that underwrote the flotation of public companies. Since 1959, Grimwade has been Principal of the Green Valley Cattle Company, and in 1996 helped form Certified Australian Angus Beef Ltd, of which he became Deputy chairman and was involved in building it into Australia's leading branded beef program. Philanthropist In 1968, Grimwade donated 26 km¬≤ (2630 hectares) of coastal land with a 27-kilometre ocean frontage on the Coorong in South Australia to the State Government for the new Coorong National Park. This represents about 5.6% of the park's total area, but over 15% of the coastline. Grimwade has been involved as a patron and executive with many charitable organisations, including: *Chairman of the Felton Bequests Committee, a foundation created in 1904 by his great-grandfather's business partner, Alfred Felton, and primarily dedicated to purchasing art work for the National Gallery of Victoria. *President (1976‚Äì1990), trustee, and life member of the National Gallery of Victoria. *Trustee of the Victorian Arts Centre. *Patron of the Miegunyah Press, an imprint of the University of Melbourne Press established by a bequest from Grimwade's great-granduncle Russell Grimwade. *Honorary Member of the Royal Society of Victoria *Fellow and Life Member of the Royal Australian Chemical Institute *Life Member of the Australian Conservation Foundation. *Founding Chairman of the Australian Arts Exhibition Corporation, which presented The Chinese Exhibition in 1976. Public Service Grimwade's public service includes: *In 1977 he was appointed a CBE for services to the Arts and the Community *In 1980 he was created a Knight Bachelor for services to Industry and Commerce *Member of the Australian Government's first trade mission to China in 1973. *Founding Member of the Australian Government Remuneration Tribunal *Inaugural Member of the Council for the Order of Australia (1975‚Äì82) *Victorian Government Board of Review into Parliamentary Salaries (1980) *Chairman of the Australian Government Committee on Official Establishments (1976‚Äì78) *Founding Chairman of the Australian Government Official Establishments Trust (1979‚Äì82). *Appointed WEHI Laureate (with Nobel Laureate Sir Macfarlane Burnet & Sir Gustav Nossal) (2007) Jetcorp Trial In 1992, Grimwade was charged with fraud and conspiracy for his involvement in a false prospectus issued for an entity called Jetcorp Australia Unit Trust. The trial became the longest running criminal trial in Victoria history. After a first jury had sat for seven months, Grimwade's wife died and he was granted a new trial. The second jury sat for over nine months, during which time the judge and some jurors were absent at various times for medical reasons. The length of the trial was exacerbated by the defence strategy of continually challenging Crown statements, with the result that the Crown was required to strictly prove each and every bit of evidence irrespective of whether it was in dispute or germane to the defence. This strategy ultimately succeeded. Grimwade was found guilty on nineteen counts of fraud and conspiracy, but the verdict was overturned on appeal, the appellate judge ruling that the case had become so convoluted that it had become impossible for the jury to render a proper verdict.

It aired on CBS on Wednesdays, then later moved to Fridays at 8 p.m. The original 60 Minutes continued airing on Sunday nights throughout the run of 60 Minutes II. The first edition of 60 Minutes II ran on January 13, 1999. Its final airing was September 2, 2005. 60 Minutes II was renamed 60 Minutes by CBS for the fall of 2004. CBS News president Andrew Heyward stated at the time, \\"The Roman numeral II created some confusion on the part of the viewers and suggested a watered-down version.\\" The show was later renamed 60 Minutes Wednesday to differentiate it from the original 60 Minutes Sunday edition, but reverted to its original title on July 8, 2005, when the show moved to the 8 p.m. Friday timeslot, where it completed its run. Correspondents The broadcast included original reporting from its team of correspondents and from other CBS News journalists. The program also featured updated reports on classic 60 Minutes stories. Credited cast on 60 Minutes II included the following CBS correspondents: Dan Rather, Bob Simon, Charlie Rose, Vicki Mabrey, Scott Pelley and Lara Logan. The following correspondents also worked on segments for the program: Christiane Amanpour, Ed Gordon, Charles Grodin, Carol Marin and Jimmy Tingle. The correspondents from 60 Minutes have reported several stories on 60 Minutes II, Ed Bradley also reported several one-hour special stories as well. Grodin, Tingle, and Bill Geist contributed semi-humorous commentaries, paralleling the sister program's Andy Rooney. Killian documents controversy 60 Minutes II ran into controversy in September 2004 when the program staff received a set of documents which alleged that, while in the service of the Texas Air National Guard, United States President George W. Bush was declared unfit for duty and suspended from service. On September 8, 2004, in the middle of the 2004 Presidential election, Dan Rather went on the air on 60 Minutes II with the documents. The authenticity of these documents was quickly called into question by experts and critics. This became known as the Killian documents controversy (or \\"Rathergate\\"). For about two weeks, Rather and his team stood by the story, but CBS later announced it could not vouch for the authenticity of the memos. The network stated that using the memos was a \\"mistake\\" and Rather apologized for the incident. These events would lead to Rather's eventual departure from the anchor chair and ouster as Correspondent from CBS News on March 9, 2005. Rather later sued in a multi-million dollar employment lawsuit. Awards 60 Minutes II earned a number of awards, including several Emmy Awards and three Peabody Awards.Peabody Awards for 60 Minutes II References External links * Category:1999 American television series debuts Category:2005 American television series endings Category:1990s American television news shows Category:2000s American television news shows Category:60 Minutes Category:English-language television shows Category:Killian documents controversy Category:CBS original programming Category:CBS News Category:Emmy Award-winning programs Category:Peabody Award- winning television programs Category:American television spin-offs Category:Television series by CBS Television Studios ","title":"60 Minutes II"},{"id":"3652398","text":"Colonel George Robin Straton Broke CVO (born 1946) was Equerry to The Queen 1974‚Äì1977, and also responsible to the Princes Andrew and Edward.

Taxonomy The checkered woodpecker was described by the French polymath Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon in 1780 in his Histoire Naturelle des Oiseaux from a specimen collected in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The bird was also illustrated in a hand-coloured plate engraved by Fran√ßois-Nicolas Martinet in the Planches Enlumin√©es D'Histoire Naturelle which was produced under the supervision of Edme-Louis Daubenton to accompany Buffon's text. Neither the plate caption nor Buffon's description included a scientific name but in 1783 the Dutch naturalist Pieter Boddaert coined the binomial name Picus mixtus in his catalogue of the Planches Enlumin√©es. The checkered woodpecker is now placed in the genus Veniliornis that was introduced by the French ornithologist Charles Lucien Bonaparte in 1854. The generic name combines the name of the Roman deity Venilia with the Ancient Greek word ornis meaning \\"bird\\". The specific epithet mixtus is the Latin word for \\"mixed\\" or \\"jumbled\\". This species was until recently classified in the genus Picoides. With its sister taxon, the striped woodpecker, it was difficult to place in this genus due to the odd head- pattern and the fine, yet bold body and wing spotting. mtDNA COI and Cyt b sequence analyses have shown that their closest relative is rather the white- spotted woodpecker, Veniliornis spilogaster which unlike its congeners shares the two \\"Picoides\\"' pattern, but is abundistic. This species co-occurs with V. m. cancellatus over much of their range. In an apparent case of character displacement, the latter is by far the lightest and least-patterned subspecies. Four subspecies are recognised: * V. m. cancellatus (Wagler, 1829) ‚Äì southeast Brazil * V. m. mixtus (Boddaert, 1783) ‚Äì east Paraguay, Uruguay and northeast Argentina * V. m. malleator (Wetmore, 1922) ‚Äì Chaco region of southeast Bolivia, west Paraguay and north Argentina * V. m. berlepschi (Hellmayr, 1915) ‚Äì west central and central Argentina Subspecific differences run contrary to Gloger's rule. V. m. malleator and V. m. berlepschi, which inhabit arid habitat, have darker and more prominent underside patterning, whereas the other two subspecies which are birds of mesic or riparian woodland are paler overall. Description The bird is about long. Its coloring is black and white, and the male has a red area on the back of its head. Status and conservation It is a widespread species and not considered threatened by the IUCN.> References  External links  * Arthur Grosset's Birds: Checkered Woodpecker - Photos of V. m. cancellatus checkered woodpecker Category:Birds of Argentina Category:Birds of the Cerrado Category:Birds of Paraguay checkered woodpecker ","title":"Checkered woodpecker"},{"id":"3652436","title":"American Bad Ass"},{"id":"3652438","text":"\\"Limelight\\" is a song by the Canadian progressive rock band Rush. It first appeared on the 1981 album Moving Pictures. The song's lyrics were written by Neil Peart with music written by Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson. \\"Limelight\\" expresses Peart's discomfort with Rush's success and the resulting attention from the public. The song paraphrases the opening lines of the \\"All the world's a stage\\" speech from William Shakespeare's play As You Like It; the band had previously used the phrase for its 1976 live album. The lyrics also refer to \\"the camera eye\\", the title of the song that follows on the Moving Pictures album. Released as a single, it charted at on the U.S. Billboard Top Tracks chart and on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100, and remains one of Rush's most popular songs. \\"Limelight\\" was one of five Rush songs inducted into the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame on March 28, 2010. Background In \\"Limelight\\", lyricist Neil Peart comments on the band's commercial success and the fame and its demands that come with rock star status. According to guitarist Alex Lifeson, the song \\"is about being under the microscopic scrutiny and the need for privacy‚Äîtrying to separate the two and not always being successful at it\\". Bassist Geddy Lee describes the motivation for \\"Limelight\\" in a 1988 interview: In a 2007 interview, Alex Lifeson gives his take on \\"Limelight\\": Recording and live performance Lifeson's guitar solo was performed on what he called a \\"Hentor Sportscaster\\", a modified Fender Stratocaster equipped with a Floyd Rose vibrato arm. Critics frequently point out Lifeson's use of vibrato in the solo, with Max Mobley writing that it \\"is dripping with Floyd Rose whammy\\". \\"Limelight\\" has been described as Lifeson's \\"signature song\\", and critics cite the influence of Allan Holdsworth. Lifeson himself calls it his favourite solo. The song was a staple of Rush's live performances, having been played on every tour since its release except the Grace Under Pressure Tour (1984), the Presto Tour (1990), and the R40 Live Tour (2015).

Known famously in British folklore as the Red Coats, these hardened soldiers were the backbone of the British Army in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. There are several possible reasons why the British Army outfitted its Regulars in red. The most commonly stated reason is that it would hide the appearance of blood on the battlefield, possibly demoralizing the troops. This is unlikely because blood would show black on the red serge tunics, and the white, or \\"buff\\" trousers that were commonly issued would hide no blood at all. Another possible explanation would be that red dye was relatively cheap, allowing the Army to give its troops better equipment without wasting money on more expensive dyes. Another good reason could be that British officers needed to be able to identify their men in heavy smoke. Red would show better through gunsmoke than most other colors. A final possibility is that red is the primary color in the Royal Standard, the Royal Coat of Arms, and is the color of St George's cross (St George is the patron saint of England). During the Napoleonic Wars, the British Regulars were a well disciplined group of foot soldiers with years of combat experience, including in the Americas, the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and the War of 1812. Around half of the British Regular \\"Redcoats\\", most were between the ages of 18 to 29; and an over sixth-tenths of the regulars were five feet, four inches, to five feet seven inches. The British Government at the time, did not allow enlisted men to be older than 45 years old. Although typically under English command, many of the enlisted Regulars were either Scottish or Irish. A small number of Regulars were from Prussia and other states within the German Confederation. From these multiple origins, also came the two different \\"Schools of Thought\\", the 'American' and the 'German'. The American school focused on open-formation light infantry tactics that were well suited for areas of rigid terrain, and dense forested areas, best suited against enemies that had no cavalry nor artillery. The 'American' school favored infantry ranks of two deep, and use of light infantry with rifles. The German school focused on disciplined, close-drill order, well suited for the vast Central Plains of Europe. This approach was preferred in large battlefields where the enemy had large numbers of cavalry plus artillery. The 'German' school favored infantry ranks of three deep, and the use of smooth bore muskets. After 1855, starting in India and gradually extending to other colonial outposts, the scarlet uniforms were often replaced with khaki on campaign for tactical reasons i.e. camouflage. However, not until 1902, and the introduction of a universal khaki service dress, would scarlet be officially abandoned as campaign dress for European operations. The classical British Regular was most famous for his action in the Battle of Culloden, the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763), the American Revolutionary War (1775‚Äì1783), the Peninsular War (1808‚Äì1815), the War of 1812 (1812‚Äì1814), and the Waterloo campaign (1815). Conflicts British regulars saw action during the American Revolutionary War. One notable use of the term was when Paul Revere, William Dawes and Samuel Prescott in the early morning hours of April 19th, 1775.

The booklet contained several pornographic images and a glossary of terminology used in the gay community. It was sold for 25 cents a copy, with a discount for bulk orders of 100 copies or more. The Johns Committee had for several years conducted a witch hunt for homosexuals in public schools, universities, and state government agencies, believing they were part of a Communist strategy to \\"subvert the American way of life by controlling academic institutions and by corrupting the nation's moral fiber.\\" By publishing its findings, the Committee hoped to persuade the Legislature to enact comprehensive anti- homosexual legislation, and to \\"shock Floridians into accepting its program.\\" > [The report] viewed homosexuals as the carriers of a degenerative disease > that posed a greater menace to society than child molesters. ...

Instead of becoming a best-seller as its authors hoped, the Purple Pamphlet provoked a backlash of criticism for its explicit photographs of gay men involved in sexual activities. A Dade County official threatened to bring legal action against the committee, and the state Attorney General \\"warned the FLIC to cease distribution of this 'obscene and pornographic' material.\\" A gay book club in Washington, D.C., sold reprints of the pamphlet for two dollars apiece.

While tracking the terrorists, mutated dinosaurs appear and the mission changes into simple survival. The dinosaurs use their skilled sense of smell and ability to swim to hunt down the SEALs and terrorists. After losing several men to the raptors and killing some of the terrorists, the SEALs manage to rescue the female agent, Jamie, captured by the terrorists. She and the remaining SEALs discover a crash site of a Chinese airplane. Around the site are broken containers that had contained nuclear waste. The team figures the spilled waste caused the local animals to mutate into dinosaurs. The dinosaurs kill all the terrorists except Azir, who murders a SEAL, stealing his armor and machine gun. After encountering more mutant raptors, the last three SEALs and Jamie find refuge in a cave, which turns out to be the nest of the dinosaurs. In the end, Azir is eaten by a mutated Carnotaurus and the island is destroyed as a result of volcanic activity. The last scene is of three raptors escaping the carnage, swimming after the rescue helicopter.

Explicit methods calculate the state of a system at a later time from the state of the system at the current time, while implicit methods find a solution by solving an equation involving both the current state of the system and the later one. Mathematically, if Y(t) is the current system state and Y(t+\\\\Delta t) is the state at the later time (\\\\Delta t is a small time step), then, for an explicit method : Y(t+\\\\Delta t) = F(Y(t))\\\\, while for an implicit method one solves an equation : G\\\\Big(Y(t), Y(t+\\\\Delta t)\\\\Big)=0 \\\\qquad (1)\\\\, to find Y(t+\\\\Delta t). Implicit methods require an extra computation (solving the above equation), and they can be much harder to implement. Implicit methods are used because many problems arising in practice are stiff, for which the use of an explicit method requires impractically small time steps \\\\Delta t to keep the error in the result bounded (see numerical stability). For such problems, to achieve given accuracy, it takes much less computational time to use an implicit method with larger time steps, even taking into account that one needs to solve an equation of the form (1) at each time step. That said, whether one should use an explicit or implicit method depends upon the problem to be solved. Since the implicit method cannot be carried out for each kind of differential operator, it is sometimes advisable to make use of the so called operator splitting method, which means that the differential operator is rewritten as the sum of two complementary operators :Y(t+\\\\Delta t) = F(Y(t+\\\\Delta t))+G(Y(t)),\\\\, while one is treated explicitly and the other implicitly. For usual applications the implicit term is chosen to be linear while the explicit term can be nonlinear. This combination of the former method is called Implicit-Explicit Method (short IMEX U.M. Ascher, S.J. Ruuth, R.J. Spiteri: Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta Methods for Time-Dependent Partial Differential Equations, Appl Numer Math, vol. 25(2-3), 1997, L.Pareschi, G.Russo: Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta schemes for stiff systems of differential equations, Recent Trends in Numerical Analysis, Vol. 3, 269-289, 2000). Illustration using the forward and backward Euler methods Consider the ordinary differential equation : \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = -y^2, \\\\ t\\\\in [0, a]\\\\quad \\\\quad (2) with the initial condition y(0)=1. Consider a grid t_k=a\\\\frac{k}{n} for 0 ‚â§ k ‚â§ n, that is, the time step is \\\\Delta t=a/n, and denote y_k=y(t_k) for each k. Discretize this equation using the simplest explicit and implicit methods, which are the forward Euler and backward Euler methods (see numerical ordinary differential equations) and compare the obtained schemes. ;Forward Euler method: The result of applying different integration methods to ode y'=-y^2, \\\\; t\\\\in[0, 5], \\\\; y_0=1 with \\\\Delta t = 5/10. The forward Euler method :\\\\left(\\\\frac{dy}{dt}\\\\right)_k \\\\approx \\\\frac{y_{k+1}-y_k}{\\\\Delta t} = - y_k^2 yields : y_{k+1}=y_k-\\\\Delta t y_k^2 \\\\quad \\\\quad \\\\quad(3)\\\\, for each k=0, 1, \\\\dots, n. This is an explicit formula for y_{k+1}. ;Backward Euler method: With the backward Euler method :\\\\frac{y_{k+1}-y_k}{\\\\Delta t} = - y_{k+1}^2 one finds the implicit equation : y_{k+1}+\\\\Delta t y_{k+1}^2=y_k for y_{k+1} (compare this with formula (3) where y_{k+1} was given explicitly rather than as an unknown in an equation). This is a quadratic equation, having one negative and one positive root. The positive root is picked because in the original equation the initial condition is positive, and then y at the next time step is given by : y_{k+1}=\\\\frac{-1+\\\\sqrt{1+4\\\\Delta t y_k}}{2 \\\\Delta t}. \\\\quad \\\\quad (4) In the vast majority of cases, the equation to be solved when using an implicit scheme is much more complicated than a quadratic equation, and no analytical solution exists. Then one uses root-finding algorithms, such as Newton's method, to find the numerical solution. ;Crank Nicolson method: With the Crank-Nicolson method :\\\\frac{y_{k+1}-y_k}{\\\\Delta t} = -\\\\frac{1}{2}y_{k+1}^2 -\\\\frac{1}{2}y_{k}^2 one finds the implicit equation : y_{k+1}+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\Delta t y_{k+1}^2=y_k - \\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\Delta t y_{k}^2 for y_{k+1} (compare this with formula (3) where y_{k+1} was given explicitly rather than as an unknown in an equation). This can be numerically solved using root-finding algorithms, such as Newton's method, to obtain y_{k+1}. Crank Nicolson can be viewed as a form of more general IMEX (Implicit- Explicit) schemes. ;Forward-Backward Euler method: The result of applying the both, the Forward Euler method as well as the Forward-Backward Euler method a = 5 and n = 30. In order to apply the IMEX-scheme, consider a slightly different differential equation: : \\\\frac{dy}{dt} = y-y^2, \\\\ t\\\\in [0, a]\\\\quad \\\\quad (5) It follows that : \\\\left(\\\\frac{dy}{dt}\\\\right)_k \\\\approx y_{k+1}-y_{k}^2, \\\\ t\\\\in [0, a] and therefore : y_{k+1}=\\\\frac{y_k(1-y_k\\\\Delta t)}{1-\\\\Delta t} \\\\quad\\\\quad(6) for each k=0, 1, \\\\dots, n.

A bicycle mechanic or bike mechanic is a mechanic who can perform a wide range of repairs on bicycles. Bicycle mechanics can be employed in various types of stores, ranging from large department stores to small local bike shops; cycling teams, or bicycle manufacturers.  Classification and wages  The New York State Department of Labor describes bicycle repair as a \\"realistic\\" occupation, meaning an occupation that would be enjoyed by somebody who likes \\"practical, hands-on problems,\\" dealing with \\"real-world materials like wood, tools, and machinery,\\" and one that \\"does not involve a lot of paperwork or working closely with others.\\" They classify it as a job that \\"usually requires a high school diploma and may require some vocational training or job-related course work. In some cases, an associate's or bachelor's degree could be needed. Employees in these occupations need anywhere from a few months to one year of working with experienced employees.\\" They indicate an annual wage in the neighborhood of $25,000, but can earn up to a little more than $40,000. \\"In 2002, employment for bicycle repairers in New York was 360.\\"  Skills and training  Repair shop in California, 1972 The skills involved in maintaining racing bicycles and other specialized bicycles of course go beyond the basics outlined in New York's \\"occupational brief.\\" Well-known schools offering advanced training for bicycle mechanics include the United Bicycle Institute of Ashland, Oregon and Barnett Bicycle Institute of Colorado Springs, and Appalachian Bicycle Institute of Asheville, North Carolina. The Park Tool Co., a well-known maker of bicycle mechanic's tools, has an outreach training program called the Park Tool School which is made available at many local bike shops, taught by local bike shop personnel with the assistance of training materials and manuals from Park Tool. One common avenue for entering the trade is to start as a bike builder or assembler at a local bike shop. This job can range from simply finishing the assembly started at the factory (attaching wheels and handlebars) to more thorough builds in which all systems are re- adjusted to a given level of quality. The range of assembly involvement varies from shop to shop. A mechanic inspects a bicycle in a repair shop Repairing a bicycle, c. 1895 In Canada there are a variety of bicycle mechanic training programs, including the BAM (Bicycle Assembly & Maintenance) program in Toronto which has been accredited by the Bicycle Trade Association of Canada (BTAC) and funded by the Ontario government in Canada. Students in the BAM program complete an 8 week program at the Learning Enrichment Foundation followed by working one week in a local Toronto bicycle shop of their choice proving their skills by assembling new bicycles and fixing old bicycles.  Documentation  A few books on being a bicycle mechanic are still in print. The most recent is Bike Mechanic: Tales from the Road and the Workshop which interviews top professional bicycle technicians on their daily lives as mechanics for professional bicycling teams. Among many references on bicycle repair, Barnett's Manual is a comprehensive four-volume set, most recently released in print in 2003 at a retail price of $124.95, that includes detailed coverage and diagrams of bicycle components from many different manufacturers. The Lonely Planet cycling guide says, \\"If you want to know more about maintaining your bike... Richard's Bicycle Book is a classic. If you want to know absolutely everything get Barnett's Manual... or Sutherland's Handbook..\\" VeloNews magazine cites Lennard Zinn's best-selling road bike and mountain bike maintenance and repair books as essential for DIY home mechanics.

Although the Tuatapere and Orawia Branches look like a single line, operationally they were considered separate lines. The first section opened to Riverton in 1879 and reached Tuatapere three decades later. The extension from Tuatapere to Orawia operated from 1925 until 1970. In 1976 the Tuatapere Branch was truncated to Riverton, and was known as the Riverton Branch until 1978, when it closed beyond Thornbury. The remaining portion of the line is now part of the Wairio Branch. Construction The desire to open up regions west of Invercargill prompted construction of this line, with developers hoping to discover plentiful minerals and resources, and encourage more substantial settlement in the area. The first section of the line was built from Makarewa on the Kingston Branch to Riverton via Thornbury, the Wairio Branch junction, and opened on 9 June 1879. The line was opened in stages: Colac on 25 July 1881, Roundhill on 24 September 1883, Orepuki on 5 May 1885, Waihoaka on 1 October 1903 and Tuatapere on 1 October 1909. There was some dispute over where to commence a railway to the settlement of Orawia. One of the two main proposals was to extend the Tuatapere line, and the other was to build a branch from Waikouro on the Wairio Branch. Ultimately, the Tuatapere proposal was accepted, and although construction was postponed due to World War I, work had recommenced by October 1919 and the Public Works Department was operating trains by mid-September 1924. The line was handed over to the New Zealand Railways Department and officially opened on 20 October 1925. Operation The line was run as two separate branches from Tuatapere: the Tuatapere Branch from Invercargill, and the Orawia Branch. During the days of steam motive power, most services on the branches were operated from a depot at Tuatapere. Trains were typically mixed, carrying both passengers and freight. One such train daily operated from Tuatapere to Invercargill and return, while another ran Invercargill to Tuatapere and return. Orawia was served by a service from Tuatapere on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Along the line, a lucrative logging industry was established and many bush tramways were built to provide easy cartage of logs to the railway line. A timber mill was established in Tuatapere to process the logs and it provided much traffic for the railway. In the early days of the line, oil shale was a prominent source of freight from Orepuki. The railway was also indispensable in helping to develop the Waiau River valley and its settlements. A locomotive from the More & Sons sawmill tramway, which ran about from Longwood, is on display beside Riverton museum. The tramway was open from 1902 to 1960. Passenger services on the Orawia Branch did not last even a decade. By 1932, passengers were no longer carried and goods trains ran only twice weekly. Passengers could travel on the rest of the line until the early 1950s, and around this time the daily Invercargill to Tuatapere and return goods train was withdrawn. This was partially offset by a Monday to Friday goods train from the Wairio Branch junction at Thornbury to Tuatapere. The Orawia Branch looked as if it could be closed at any time until a cement works was constructed in the town in 1956. It provided sufficient traffic to justify the Orawia Branch's existence. Traffic declined during the 1960s, and when steam motive power was replaced by DJ class diesel-electrics in June 1968, Tuatapere locomotive depot closed and services changed to operate out of Invercargill thrice weekly, on Monday, Wednesday and Friday. In May 1968 the cement works in Orawia closed, and deprived of its main source of traffic, the Orawia Branch closed on 1 October 1970. By the mid-1970s, only 4,500 tonnes of traffic yearly were railed west of Riverton and the line was cut back to Riverton on 30 July 1976. There were expectations that forestry developments would create sufficient traffic from Riverton, but these failed to eventuate and the line from Thornbury was closed on 15 January 1978. A minor protest to keep the Thornbury to Riverton section open for tourism and potential private railway operations, was to no avail. The section from Makarewa and Thornbury became part of the Wairio Branch. The branch today Some notable relics remained after closure. The most significant of these was the causeway and truss bridge that crossed the mouth of the Jacob River estuary in Riverton. The bridge and formation was removed in 2003, with one truss preserved by a local museum. The wooden viaduct near Tuatapere still exists. Tuatapere station and yard area are used by the local Jewish community, with the goods shed, station building, and water tank all standing in relatively good condition, though the station building's exterior requires repairs and there are proposals to relocate it to a site on the Otago Central Rail Trail.Shirley Whyte, \\"Railway station in need of repair\\", The Southland Times, 16 June 2007. The Orawia Branch's formation is distinct for much of its length, and at the terminus is the goods shed, with the ruins of the old cement works nearby. The formation of the Tuatapere Branch is also pretty clear in most places, and in Wakatapu some discarded rails and sleepers are at the old yard site, while a loading bank is at Ruahine and relocated station buildings still stand at Longwood and Orepuki. A clear view of the formation is available on Google Earth.

The third installment in the Silent Hill series and a direct sequel to the first Silent Hill game, it follows Heather, a teenager who becomes entangled in the machinations of the town's cult, which seeks to revive a malevolent deity. It was released in May 2003, with a port to Microsoft Windows released in October of the same year. A remastered high- definition version was released as part of the Silent Hill HD Collection (2012), for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Originally planned to be a rail shooter, as a result of the initially slow sales of Silent Hill 2 in Japan, Silent Hill 3 was developed almost simultaneously alongside another installment in the series, Silent Hill 4: The Room (2004). Among the influences on Silent Hill 3 are the film Jacob's Ladder and the works of horror novelist Stephen King. Silent Hill 3 sold more than 300,000 copies by November 2003 and was critically successful, garnering praise for its presentation, including the environments, graphics and audio, as well as the overall horror elements and themes that are continued from past installments; there also were minor criticism of the game's short length and gameplay mechanics. Its plot was loosely adapted into the 2012 film Silent Hill: Revelation 3D. Gameplay Heather in the beginning stage of the game, next to a monster. Silent Hill 3 is a survival-horror video game in which the player takes control of Heather, a teenager who awakens from a nightmare in a shopping mall and tries to return home to her father, while navigating environments that oscillate between reality and the Otherworld, a bloodier, supernatural version of it. Gameplay in Silent Hill 3 resembles closely that of its two predecessors, with gameplay set in the third-person view and divided among elements of combat, exploration, and puzzle-solving. The difficulty of both the combat and puzzle elements of the game can be set separately. In the case of the puzzle difficulties, there is a considerable difference between the \\"medium\\" difficulty level and the \\"hard\\" difficulty level; one of the puzzles on the \\"medium\\" level requires only simple pattern recognition, while the \\"hard\\" difficulty level version of the same puzzle requires knowledge of Shakespearean plays to complete. To aid in exploration, Heather obtains a flashlight and radio early on, the latter of which crackles when monsters are in proximity. She can find \\"health\\" restoratives, such as first aid kits and energy drinks; beef jerky, used to lure monsters away from her path; and a range of firearms and melee weapons to fend off the monsters with. She can also block and perform side-step maneuvers to avoid enemies. Heather will also update any relevant maps of the area with notes on locked doors, inaccessible areas, and potential clues to puzzles. While the floor plans of the various environments largely remains consistent between reality and the Otherworld, certain areas may be rendered inaccessible in the Otherworld, with barriers or bottomless gulfs appearing in the street, for example. The game also features unlockable weapons and costumes. Plot Silent Hill 3 takes place in the fictional universe of the Silent Hill series. It opens with Heather's (Heather Morris) nightmare of being trapped in a derelict amusement park and killed by the roller coaster. She awakens in a burger restaurant, but before she can leave the shopping mall and return home to her father, private detective Douglas Cartland (Richard Grosse) confronts her, claiming to have information about her birth. Heather evades him and discovers that the mall is mostly abandoned except for monsters. She then encounters Claudia (Donna Burke), a mysterious woman who hints that Heather will be instrumental in bringing about paradise on earth. Heather soon finds herself in the Otherworld version of the mall ‚Äî monster-filled, bloodstained, and decaying ‚Äî and eventually returns to the original shopping mall, where she finds Douglas again. He confesses that Claudia had hired him to find her, though denies prior knowledge of the Otherworld or of any greater agenda of Claudia's. Heather leaves the mall and resolves to take the subway home. When she returns home to her apartment, she discovers that her father was murdered on Claudia's orders. Claudia informs her that Harry's murder was out of revenge and to engender hatred in Heather. Before leaving, Claudia informs her that she will be waiting for her in Silent Hill. Intent on killing Claudia, Heather resolves to go to Silent Hill and accepts Douglas's offer to drive her there. On the journey there, Heather learns from a journal left by her father, Harry Mason, that she was the baby left to him at the end of the first Silent Hill game. Because she is the reincarnation of Alessa, the girl originally intended to birth the cult's god, Claudia intends for her to bring forth the god. Arriving in the abandoned and fog-shrouded town, Heather sets out to find Leonard in a local hospital. Revealed to be Claudia's abusive father, he intends to dispose of Claudia as cult leader and attacks Heather after learning that she is not a member of the cult. Heather defeats him. She journeys to the local church via a local amusement park, purportedly at Douglas' request. When Heather arrives at the amusement park, she finds him wounded, having tried to stop Claudia. He considers killing Heather to stop the god from being born but decides against it. Heather reaches the church and learns that Claudia, who was Alessa's childhood friend, intends to bring about the god's birth to remake the world into a paradise. Heather confronts her and vomits out the fetal deity, nourished by her hatred, with the aid of a supernatural substance given to her by Harry before his death. Claudia promptly swallows the fetus to Heather's horror and dies after birthing it. Heather then defeats the newly born god. Three endings appear in the game. The \\"Normal\\" ending, which is the only ending available on the first play-through of the game, sees Heather and Douglas survive, while in the \\"Possessed\\" ending, Heather kills Douglas. In the \\"Revenge\\" ending, which is a joke ending accessible by performing certain in-game actions, Heather reunites with Harry, and Harry orders UFOs to blow up Silent Hill. Development Silent Hill 3 promotion at E3 2003 Silent Hill 3 was created by Team Silent, a production group within Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo. Development on the PlayStation 2 version began after the release of Silent Hill 2 in September 2001, and was carried out almost simultaneously with development of another Silent Hill title that was intended to explore a different direction for the franchise and not be part of the main, numbered series; known as Room 302, this game would eventually become integrated into the main series as Silent Hill 4: The Room. The development team for this iteration was smaller than that working on Silent Hill 2, with around 40 people working on the game, made up of the core team from the second title and some newcomers. A smaller group of Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo staff later developed a port for Microsoft Windows. Early sketch of antagonist Claudia Wolf (left) and her final appearance (right) Silent Hill 3 was originally planned to be a rail shooter, not a direct sequel to the first Silent Hill game, as a result of the initially slow sales and fan criticism of Silent Hill 2 in Japan. According to Masahiro Ito, this decision wasted considerable development time and part of the game's budget. Eventually, the plan was discarded, although the concept of a Silent Hill rail shooter was later explored with Silent Hill: The Arcade in 2007. Like all Silent Hill games, one of Silent Hill 3s influences is the film Jacob's Ladder: one of the subway platforms is named Bergen Street Station, the station Jacob was inquiring about at the beginning of the film. The developers also cited horror writer Stephen King as another of their influences. Silent Hill 3 incorporates references drawn from real life actors and actresses. Douglas Cartland's name came from American actor Douglas Fairbanks. The developers stated that his name \\"just seemed to suit him\\" and that there was no true connection to his namesake. During the sketching process, his character was modeled after actors Giancarlo Giannini and Ian Holm. It was noted even during the concept designs that Cartland was designed as a middle-aged detective. Claudia Wolf's character was considered the most difficult to design. Early sketches revealed that the creators wanted to dress her like a holy woman, and at one point she had a shaved head, with her body covered with tattoos, however, the creators thought that this way of showing her malevolent side was too obvious. Eventually, the creators decided to model her on Julianne Moore, and then remove her eyebrows, so that the appearance was slightly skewed. She was first named \\"Christie\\", but it was deemed too \\"cute\\" and the character was eventually named after Italian actress Claudia Cardinale. Vincent's name originated from actor Vincent Gallo in connection with his unshaven look. Early designs were based on actor Ethan Hawke and focused on capturing a look of \\"derangement and moodiness.\\" A remastered high- definition version was released as part of the Silent Hill HD Collection, for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 on March 20, 2012. =Music= The soundtrack for Silent Hill 3, composed by Akira Yamaoka, was released in Europe on March 25, 2003 and in Japan on July 16, 2003. The song \\"You're Not Here\\" was included in the PS2 port of Dance Dance Revolution Extreme, and is also included in the Silent Hill Experience UMD media pack. The game's soundtrack is the first using vocals prominently. Most of the vocalized tracks are performed by Mary Elizabeth McGlynn (credited as Melissa Williamson); one song features vocals by Joe Romersa. Reception Silent Hill 3 received positive reviews, garnering an 85/100 rating at Metacritic for the PlayStation 2 version, and a 72/100 rating for the PC version. The PC version fared less well, with some reviewers drawing unfavourable comparisons to other combat- based games found on the PC platform, while others highlighted some technical issues, such as poor gamepad controller support. Positive reactions were given to the general horror and atmosphere of the game, including \\"truly horrifying sections\\", it \\"packs some genuine scares\\" and \\"the feeling of eeriness and doom is almost overwhelming\\". The story told as part of the atmosphere was also received positively, making for a \\"satisfying, coherent sequel\\", although its status as such meant that \\"it may be a little tough to follow for people who haven't played the first game\\", despite \\"a laudable effort to help people catch up\\". In addition, the graphics, audio and production values were all credited with adding positively to the atmosphere. Negative criticism largely stemmed from the lack of any innovations in gameplay; the game \\"doesn't do anything major that the series hasn't done before\\", \\"does little in term of innovation\\" and \\"doesn't offer much beyond the other titles in the series\\". Also criticised was the game's camera and control system which, despite having been improved from previous games, was described as \\"awkward, disorienting, and motion sickness-inducing\\". Some criticism stemmed from the length of the game, as it \\"can be easily beaten in a handful of hours\\". Silent Hill 3 sold over 300,000 copies by November 2003. The game also topped sales charts in Japan upon its release. Film adaptation A film adaptation of Silent Hill 3, titled Silent Hill: Revelation 3D, was released on October 26, 2012, by Open Road Films. The film is a sequel to the film adaptation of the first installment in the Silent Hill series. Directed by M. J. Bassett, it starred Adelaide Clemens as Heather, Kit Harington as Vincent Cooper, Sean Bean as Harry Mason, Carrie-Ann Moss as Claudia Wolf, and Malcolm McDowell as Leonard Wolf. The film received a 5% approval rating from review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, with a general consensus: \\"Mediocre effort even by the standards of video game adaptations, Silent Hill: Revelation 3D features weak characters and an incomprehensible plot with a shortage of scares\\".

It was published for Microsoft Windows by Focus Home Interactive in Europe in September 2006, and by Ubisoft in North America in June 2007. It was ported to the Xbox 360 in 2007, published worldwide by Ubisoft. It was released on Xbox Live in March 2011. The North American PC release version of the game was one of the first PC games optimized for Windows Vista and DirectX 10. Call of Juarez is the first game in the Call of Juarez series. The game tells the story of Billy \\"Candle\\" and Ray McCall, a former gunslinger turned preacher. After two years in Juarez looking for the mysterious \\"Gold of Juarez\\", Billy returns to his home town of Hope, Texas, near the Mexican border. However, when he arrives at his farm, he finds his mother and stepfather have been murdered, and \\"Call of Juarez\\" written on a barn in their blood. Mistakenly believing that Billy is the killer, McCall (his step-uncle) abandons his role as the town's preacher and sets out to avenge their deaths by killing Billy, as Billy himself tries to find out who actually committed the murders, and why. Call of Juarez received mixed to positive reviews, with most critics praising Ray's levels and the general shooting mechanics, but finding Billy's levels considerably inferior, especially the platforming sections. Although the game did not sell very well in North America, it fared better in Europe, with Techland citing it as \\"putting us on the map.\\" Overall, the game was enough of a success that Techland and Ubisoft established a Call of Juarez franchise. The series includes a direct prequel (Bound in Blood), a loose sequel set in contemporary Los Angeles and Mexico (The Cartel), and a narratively unrelated game with similar gameplay (Gunslinger). Gameplay Call of Juarez is a first-person shooter in which the player controls alternating protagonists: Billy \\"Candle\\" and Ray McCall, each of whom have a different style of gameplay. Billy's levels are partially stealth-based, whereas Ray's are more traditional shoot 'em up style. Although the style of play for both characters is slightly different, controlling each character is broadly similar. Each can move forward and backward, can strafe left and right, can run, walk, sneak, and jump. Each shares an identical HUD, with the same information available to the player; currently held weapons, ammo count, a compass with objectives marked, and current health points. Both characters can single and/or dual wield six shooters, or single wield other weapons, such as rifles. Both characters can also lean to the left and right without moving from their current position, and can interact with certain objects, such as health pick-ups (in the Xbox 360 version, health automatically regenerates over time), ammo and dropped weaponry. The main differences between the two characters is that Ray is stronger and slower, he cannot jump as high as Billy, but he can kick heavy obstacles out of his way and take considerably more damage from enemy fire. Billy can move faster than Ray and is quieter, allowing him to sneak up on enemies. He can also grip onto ledges and pull himself up. Billy can also use two weapons Ray cannot - a whip, and a bow and arrow. Weapons common to both characters include various types of six shooters, rifles and shotguns. Both characters can also throw dynamite and can start fires by throwing oil lamps. They are also both capable of hand-to-hand combat, although unlike Billy, Ray is able to pick up items such as chairs and boxes, and either throw them at enemies, or use them as melee weapons. Also unique to Ray is his ability to rapid fire a single six-shooter, a technique known as \\"fanning\\", and his ability to wield a Bible. If the player presses the shoot button for the hand holding the Bible, Ray will quote a random bible passage. In the Xbox 360 version, this will occasionally cause enemies to panic, and drop their weapons. Billy can use his whip for neutralizing aggressive animals, such as snakes and wolves, and for swinging across gaps by using tree branches. When he uses the bow and arrow, the game automatically goes into slow motion. This is the only weapon in the game that allows for silent kills, meaning Billy can kill enemies without alerting others to his presence. duel in Call of Juarez. When the timer reaches zero, the enemy will reach for their gun; only then is the player able to reach for their own weapon. Players cannot move during duels except to lean slightly to the left and the right. Slow motion in Ray's levels is called \\"concentration mode\\". To enter this mode, Ray must holster both of his six shooters. During combat, when he draws either one, concentration mode is automatically activated, and the game goes into slow motion, with two targeting reticles appearing on either side of the screen, with each moving towards the center. The player cannot control the movement of either reticle, or move their character during concentration mode, but they can control the positioning of the screen, allowing them to maneuver Ray's vision so as to position the reticles over an enemy. They can also shoot independently from either their left or right gun, or both simultaneously. Ray's levels also involve numerous gun duels between Ray and one or more enemies. In these shootouts, the player must wait for a countdown, at which point the enemy will reach for their weapon. Only then can Ray draw his own gun and fire. Movement during duels is limited to leaning left and right. Billy's levels involve a degree of stealth. Unlike Ray, Billy can move totally silently whilst in sneak mode, and can hide in bushes and shadows. When he does so, he is hidden from enemy sight, and his character icon on the HUD is blacked out to show he cannot be seen. Often, even if he is seen, if he can hide quickly enough, he will escape permanent detection. Both Billy and Ray can also ride horses during the game, from which they can shoot, jump large distances and enter gallop mode. Gallop mode can only be maintained for a certain amount of time, however, before the horse becomes tired. =Multiplayer= The game also features multiplayer mode (available via LAN and online on PC, and via System Link and Xbox Live on Xbox 360), with several gameplay types. Both the Windows and the Xbox 360 versions feature \\"Deathmatch\\" mode, \\"Skirmish\\" mode (team deathmatch), \\"Robbery\\" mode (the team designated as \\"Outlaws\\" must find the hidden gold and return it to an \\"escape zone\\" without being caught by the team designated as \\"Lawmen\\"), and \\"Gold Rush\\" mode (gold is spread over the map; at the end of a specified time, the player who has collected the most gold wins). The Xbox 360 version also features \\"Capture the Bag\\" mode (each team has a bag of gold. To win, one team must capture the other team's bag and return it to their own base), \\"Wanted\\" mode (one player is randomly designated as the \\"wanted\\" player, and other players can only score points by killing this particular player. Once the wanted player is killed, the player who killed them then becomes the wanted player. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins), and \\"Famous Events\\" mode (game scenarios based on real-life events, such as the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, the Wilcox Train Robbery, the last raid of the Dalton Gang, and scenarios based on robberies committed by Jesse James and Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch). Plot The game concerns the legend of the Lost Gold of Juarez. Reported to be the ransom for Moctezuma, the Gold disappeared after the Fall of Tenochtitlan, with some believing it was buried near the town of Juarez. The legend says that Huitzilopochtli placed a curse on the treasure, leading all who seek it to insanity. The game begins with Billy \\"Candle\\" returning to his hometown of Hope in Texas after two years searching for the treasure. Although excited to see his mother Marisa, he doesn't want to see his stepfather Thomas, who used to beat him daily. Billy has no idea who his real father is, and got his nickname from a medallion with a candle engraved on it, given to him by his mother. Upon arriving at his farm, Billy finds Thomas and Marisa dead, lying underneath the words \\"Call of Juarez\\" written on the wall in their blood. In town, a woman alerts Reverend Ray McCall (the local preacher and Thomas's brother) of gunshots at Thomas's farm. Ray races to the farm to see Billy standing over the bodies. Billy panics and flees, causing Ray to assume Billy is the killer. Believing himself ordained by God to avenge their deaths, he sets out to track Billy down. Billy heads to his friend Molly Ferguson's ranch, believing she is the only one who will accept his innocence. As Ray arrives at the ranch, he meets a group of Texas Rangers, who tell him they are about to attack the ranch because Mr. Ferguson is a rustler. Ray helps them, chasing Billy into a field and shooting him. Billy falls from a mountain into a nearby river. At that moment, Ray hears a scream from the ranch, and returns to find that the rangers ‚Äì who are actually bandits ‚Äì have killed most of the occupants and taken Molly captive. Reaching the river before Ray can catch them, he breaks down, asking if God has abandoned him, and determining to redeem himself by saving Molly. Meanwhile, Billy survives his fall, but loses his medallion in the river. He is nursed back to health by Calm Water ‚Äì a Native America medicine man ‚Äì who advises him to accept who he really is and embrace his destiny. Although skeptical, Billy carries out a series of errands for Calm Water. However, upon returning, he finds the bandits who posed as rangers have killed Calm Water. They knock Billy out and take him captive. In a semi-conscious state, Billy remembers a story his mother told him about the meaning of the medallion. Elsewhere, Ray learns that the bandits are taking Molly to Juarez. An imprisoned Billy then meets Juan Mendoza, for whom the bandits work. He reveals himself as Billy's father, explaining that Marisa left him for Thomas, and that the medallion is the key to locate the Gold. He sent his men to Hope to get it from Marisa, but when they found she didn't have it, they killed her and Thomas. Billy explains he lost the medallion in the river, but Mendoza doesn't believe him and sends him into the desert, threatening to kill Molly if he fails to find the Gold in one hour. Using his mother's story, Billy locates the Gold in a hidden underground passage. However, Mendoza followed him, and attempts to kill him. Billy flees, and is rescued by Ray, who tells him to find safety as he returns to Mendoza's alcazar to rescue Molly. Ray then reveals his own story: he and Thomas were running cattle over the Mexican border when they met Marisa. They both fell in love with her, and she chose Thomas. They fled to the cavern in which the Gold was hidden, but Ray tracked them. There, he confronted Thomas, and their younger brother William, a priest, tried to intervene, but Ray killed him. From then on, Ray renounced violence and embraced God. Believing the Gold to be cursed, he, Marisa and Thomas agreed to leave it behind and seal the cavern. Ray storms Mendoza's alcazar and fights his way to Molly's cell, but Mendoza traps them both inside and sets fire to the cell. Billy arrives and puts out the fire. He shoots Mendoza and releases Ray and Molly. However, as Ray leaves the cell, Mendoza appears and shoots him, revealing he had been wearing armor when Billy shot him. Juan and Billy fight, with Billy defeating him. As he lies dying, Ray realizes everything was his fault and prays that his actions will not lead to the deaths of Billy and Molly. He recovers his strength just as Mendoza pulls out a knife and is about to stab Billy from behind. With his last action, Ray kills Mendoza before dying happily. Billy and Molly bury Ray in a nearby cemetery. As they stand by his grave, Billy says he will take Calm Water's advice to stop running away from his destiny and from his true self. Development =Origins= The game was originally announced by Techland in a leaflet at the 2004 E3 event, under the name Lawman. In March 2005, however, Techland revealed the game's name had been changed to Call of Juarez, and with that change, the focus of the gameplay had also shifted. According to producer Pawel Zawodny; In an interview with IGN in August 2005, Zawodny explained the initial inspiration behind the game was to do a \\"serious\\" Western themed first-person shooter, as Zawodny felt the FPS genre has become overly dominated by World War II and science fiction games. He revealed a major part of the gameplay would involve dueling, with players needing quick reflexes to win, just as real life gunslingers would have needed at the time. He also explained the development team had carried out extensive research for the game - the guns act the way the real guns of the period did, and the clothes, flora, fauna and architecture are accurate to the locations during the period in which the game is set. =Technology= Speaking of the game's physics engine, Zawodny explained, In relation to the game's graphics, he explained Call of Juarez was using a new version of Techland's own game engine, the Chrome Engine. The engine had last been used in Xpand Rally Xtreme, but since then, Techland had been working with nVidia to incorporate Shader Model 3.0. The enhanced version of the engine, Chrome Engine 3, also features per-pixel lighting, and rendering techniques such as normal mapping, phong shading, Blinn lighting, virtual displacement mapping, shadow mapping, HDR environment mapping, and post processing effects (such as enhanced depth-of-field, light blooms, refraction and heat distortion). The engine also facilitated multi-morph facial mimics, Shader Model 3.0-based simulation and animation of vegetation, fumes and smoke, changes in daytime and the position of global lighting, wind effects, rigid body dynamics, and alterations to object properties when interacting with liquids. The game would also come with ChromeEd; an \\"effective and easy to use authoring tool for creating not only user's own maps but even completely new mods. Full user tools will be available for creation of almost every aspect of the game and left up to the users' imagination.\\" Zawodny believed the game would provide players with a great example of \\"a new level of emergent gameplay.\\" =Influences and release= Ray McCall's appearance in the game was partially inspired by Carl McCoy (pictured), lead singer of Fields of the Nephilim. In an interview with GameSpot in February 2006, one of the game's writers, Harris Orkin, explained Pawel Selinger, the game's lead designer and artist, came up with the basic plot and characters, but Orkin wrote the dialogue and the specifics of the story, staying in contact with the Polish-based Techland from Los Angeles. Orkin particularly cited John Ford's The Searchers, Henry Hathaway's Nevada Smith and Clint Eastwood's Pale Rider and Unforgiven as influencing the tone of the game, with the character of Ray loosely based on Will Munny in Unforgiven. Orkin was also influenced by Garth Ennis' comic book Just a Pilgrim and The Saint of Killers character from Ennis' Preacher series. Visually, Ray was based on Carl McCoy, lead singer of Fields of the Nephilim. In April 2006, Ubisoft announced they had signed the publishing rights for the game in North America, with Jay Cohen, Senior Vice President of Marketing, stating \\"Call of Juarez is a tribute to the Wild West, the birthplace of the 'shooter'. It is the first game to truly represent the Wild West with its engaging storyline, characters and gorgeous environments. Ubisoft is thrilled to be partnering with Techland to bring this unique title to PC gamers.\\" The game would be published in Europe by Focus Home Interactive. Demos of the game were shown at the 2006 E3 event in May, and the Leipzig Games Convention in August. The Microsoft Windows version of the game was released in Europe in September 2006. The North American version was not released until June 2007, having been delayed so as to be released alongside the Xbox 360 port. However, Techland used the time to make some changes to the game; unlike the European version, which only supported DirectX 9.0c and was intended to run on Windows 2000 or Windows XP, the North American version was optimized for Windows Vista and DirectX 10, one of the first PC games optimized for the new operating system. Shortly after the release of the North American version, Techland released a DirectX 10 enhancement patch for all versions of the game. =Xbox 360 version= Ubisoft first announced the game would be ported to the Xbox 360 on February 28, 2007, with a North American release scheduled for roughly the same time as the North American PC release, and a European release set for shortly thereafter. The port was being handled by Techland themselves. In an interview with GameSpot in March 2007, Pawel Zawodny explained why Techland had chosen to port to the Xbox 360; Comparing the 360 version to the PC version, Zawodny stated there would be considerable graphical improvement; \\"We squeezed as much as possible from the Xbox 360's vertex and pixel shaders. There's high dynamic range lighting, hardware anti-aliasing, bump mapping on almost everything, relief mapping on many objects, and subsurface scattering, just to mention a few technical terms.\\" He also revealed the 360 version would utilize both Xbox Live and System Link for multiplayer mode, Gamerscore achievements for both single and multiplayer modes, and would feature a number of non-story single-player bonus missions, and additional multiplayer modes and maps. Reception Call of Juarez received \\"mixed or average reviews\\" on both systems; the PC version holds an aggregate score of 72 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on twenty-five reviews, and the Xbox 360 version holds a score 71 out of 100, based on thirty-seven reviews. Eurogamer's Kieron Gillen scored the PC version 8 out 10, calling it \\"a maximalist game which lobs pretty much every idea it can think of at the wall and sees what works.\\" He praised the structure of alternating levels between Billy and Ray, arguing it \\"leads to a brilliant sense of tension and release,\\" and concluded \\"Of all the cowboy games in the last few years, Call of Juarez is the one which most feels like it has a soul. Impassioned and imaginative [...] It's a game which you feel someone actually cared about making.\\" Tom Bramwell also scored the Xbox 360 version 8 out of 10. Although he was somewhat critical of the controls (especially the need to manually pick up ammo, and the use of Billy's whip), he praised the game's use of the genre; \\"the dirt under its fingernails, however tightly packed, has given new life to an area of the FPS genre where tons of developers have given up.\\" He was also impressed with the game's multiplayer modes and its graphical improvements over the PC version. GameSpot's Alex Navarro scored the PC version 7 out of 10 and the Xbox 360 version 7.4 out of 10, calling the game \\"a well-made genre exercise that's more often entertaining than not.\\" Whilst he praised Ray's levels, he was critical of Billy's, especially the implementation of the whip. He concluded that \\"it does enough right to transcend its various issues and turn in a pleasing shooter. It does the Old West motif well, the gunslinging (and bible slinging) are a lot of fun, and the capable multiplayer modes have enough going for them to give the game a bit of staying power. It doesn't quite rise past the ceiling established by other recent western shooters, but it's good, solid fun all around.\\" IGN's Dan Adams scored the PC version 6.8 out of 10, writing \\"solid shooting mechanics mix with poor level design while potentially interesting protagonists are bludgeoned with ho-hum enemies. Sadly some of the game's signature features, such as the slow-motion focus shooting, are hugely overused and actually drag the game down.\\" He praised Ray's levels but criticized Billy's, especially the implementation of the whip, and concluded \\"There are some fun and frantic moments here [...] but overall the level design is a linear letdown.\\" Jonathan Miller scored the Xbox 360 version 7.5 out of 10. He too much preferred Ray's levels, but wrote \\"Western fans are really going to enjoy Call of Juarez, a game not afraid to take chances and have fun with itself.\\" He praised the atmosphere, soundtrack, and variety of gameplay styles, concluding \\"while Call of Juarez isn't particularly great in any [one] area, you have to hand it to Techland for developing one of the most fun Westerns to date.\\" GameSpy's Thierry Nguyen scored the PC version 2.5 out of 5, calling it \\"well-meaning but ultimately flawed.\\" He too disliked Billy's levels, especially the platforming sections. He concluded \\"Call of Juarez is a game we wanted to like, as it has most of the requisite elements that we look for in a Western. It's just that the really sloppy platforming and box-moving, which take up a good chunk of the game, puts a big damper on any joy that we might find in shooting up bandits and cowboys.\\" Sterling McGarvey also scored the Xbox 360 version 2.5 out of 5, calling it \\"yet another Tex-Mex shooter that seems to have been made by a bunch of guys who've watched a few too many Westerns but haven't figured out how to get the ambience and authenticity of the historical period down.\\" He praised the shooting mechanics, but concluded \\"For the most part, Call of Juarez has taken two core ideas and melded them into a game. [...] There will be inevitable comparisons to Neversoft's GUN, but CoJ feels much more a next-gen version of the lackluster Dead Man's Hand than anything else.\\" =Sales= The game did not sell well in North America. According to the NPD Group, it sold only 137,000 units across both PC and Xbox 360. However, its European sales were considerably better, with Techland crediting the game as putting them on the map as a globally recognised developer. Overall, the game sold well enough that Techland and Ubisoft established a Call of Juarez franchise. Prequel and sequels Since the original Call of Juarez, there have been three further games in the series, all developed by Techland and published by Ubisoft. The first, Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood, was released in 2009 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows. Set roughly twenty years prior to the events of the original game, Bound in Blood focuses on the exploits of the McCall brothers. Opening towards the end of the American Civil War in 1864, the game begins with Ray and Thomas fighting for the Confederate States Army against the Union Army during the Atlanta Campaign. After abandoning their post to try to save their family home, they become outlaws, accompanied by their brother William. The game goes on to tell the story of how the brothers first encounter Juan Mendoza and Marisa, finding the Gold of Juarez, and ultimately causing William's death. The game ends two years after it begins, with Ray becoming a priest and marrying Thomas and Marisa, who is pregnant with Mendoza's son, Billy Candle. It received mainly positive reviews. The next game, Call of Juarez: The Cartel, was released in 2011 for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Windows. Set in contemporary Los Angeles and Mexico, the game follows the story of LAPD detective Ben McCall, FBI agent Kimberly Evans and DEA agent Eddie Guerra as they attempt to ascertain who bombed the DEA headquarters, and why. The game is connected to the previous two Call of Juarez games insofar as Ben McCall is the great-grandson of Billy \\"Candle\\" and is from Hope, one of the villains is called Juan Mendoza (although it is never specified if he is related to the Juan Mendoza from the first two games), two locations are revisited (Juarez' fort and a town from Bound in Blood), and several criminal organizations are attempting to find the Gold of Juarez. The game was poorly received, with designer Pawel Marchewka calling it \\"a mistake\\" and arguing it was released before it was ready. The fourth game, Call of Juarez: Gunslinger, was released in 2013 as a downloadable-only title (for PlayStation 3 through the PlayStation Network, for Xbox 360 through Xbox Live, and for Windows through Steam). The game returns to the Old West setting of the first two games, but introduces a new storyline and a new set of characters. Spanning thirty years, the game takes place across a wide range of locations, including Wyoming, Montana, Kansas, Missouri, and Colorado, as an unreliable narrator relates his encounters with people such as Billy the Kid, Butch Cassidy, and Newman Haynes Clanton. The game ends with a teenager heading to West Point, who is revealed to be Dwight D. Eisenhower. It received mainly positive reviews.

It is approximately in length. It begins at the Trans- Canada Highway (Highway 1) east of Strathmore, and ends at Fort Saskatchewan where it is succeeded by Highway 15. The northernmost of the highway are twinned. Highway 21 runs roughly parallel to the main north-south CN rail line between Calgary and Edmonton between Three Hills and Looma.  Route description  Highway 21 begins at Highway 1 approximately east of Strathmore in Wheatland County and travels north, passing near the village of Rockyford (located about east of Highway 21) and it reaches a four-way stop at Highway 9 between Beiseker and Drumheller, where it crosses into Kneehill County. It continues north past the village Carbon (located about east of Highway 21) to the intersection of Highway 27 east / Highway 582 west, beginning concurrency with Highway 27\\\\. Highway 21 continues to the town of Three Hills, home of Prairie Bible Institute, passing along the town's eastern edge. North of Three Hills, the CN rail line begins to run parallel to the highway, serving most of the communities along the route. Highway 27 departs from Highway 21 towards Olds, about south of the town Trochu. Highway 21 passes the hamlet of Huxley and the access road to Dry Island Buffalo Jump Provincial Park before entering Red Deer County; the Kneehill / Red Deer county boundary also signifies the transition from the prairie to aspen parkland ecosystem, with increasing foliage. Highway 21 bypasses Elnora and Lousana prior to Delburne, skirting its western edge on a bypass constructed in the 1980s. North of Delburne, Highway 21 reaches a T intersection with Highway 595 and turns east for along Township Road 380, then north at Range Road 231, the former alignment through Delburne. The roadway narrows for the following as it heads towards the Red Deer River, which it crosses at the Content Bridge. North of the Red Deer River, it briefly enters Stettler County, crossing Highway 11 and Highway 12. Highway 21 turns west and follows Highway 12 for entering Lacombe County, before turning north, about east of the village of Alix. It passes by the hamlet of Mirror before entering Camrose County, passing northwest of Buffalo Lake. The route bypasses Bashaw, concurrent with Highway 53 , then continues north past Ferintosh and the hamlets of New Norway and Duhamel, crossing the Battle River at an area locally known as Ross' Flats. Highway 21 intersects Highway 13 at the locality of Ervick, about west of the city of Camrose, home of the Augustana Faculty of the University of Alberta (formerly Augustana University College) and Big Valley Jamboree; Highway 21 is considered the main north-south highway serving Camrose despite not entering city limits. It continues north past the hamlet of Armena and village of Hay Lakes, entering Leduc County just south of the hamlet of New Sarepta, into the eastern portion of the Edmonton Metropolitan Region. North of the hamlet Looma, it enters Strathcona County and reaches an interchange with Highway 14\\\\. It becomes a divided highway, passing along the eastern edge of Sherwood Park prior to an interchange at Highway 16\\\\. Highway 21 continues north to the city of Fort Saskatchewan in which it ends at Highway 15.  History  The southern terminus of Highway 21 was originally at Highway 9 in the village of Beiseker, travelled north for along present-day Highway 806 to the village of Acme, travelled east for approximately along present-day Highway 575, before turning north towards Three Hills. In , Highway 21 was realigned to travel due south from Three Hills to Highway 9, and was later extended to Highway 1 near Strathmore, while the former section was renumbered to Highway 21A until , when it was renumbered to Highway 26, and again renumbered in to its present designations. The section from Fort Saskatchewan to Highway 16 was originally designated as Highway 55\\\\. By 1960, Highway 21 terminated at Highway 14 southwest of Edmonton. In the 1970s, Highway 21 was extended north from Highway 14 past Sherwood Park to Highway 16, while Highway 55 was renumbered and became part of Highway 21. The section of Highway 21 previously designated as 55 was twinned in the 1980s, and the section adjacent to Sherwood Park was completed in late 2009.  Future  Alberta Transportation has long term plans to replace the Content Bridge across the Red Deer River with a new crossing north of Delburne. Right-of-way is protected from the Highway 595 intersection to Highway 11 southwest of Alix, as well as from the current Highway 21 north / Highway 12 intersection south to Highway 11 ‚Äì internally designated as Highway 921. There is no timeline on construction. Alberta Transportation, in partnership with the City of Edmonton, City of Fort Saskatchewan, Strathcona County, and Sturgeon County, is also studying a new North Saskatchewan River crossing in northeast Edmonton that would include a new roadway from the Highway 15 / Highway 28A intersection to Highway 21 south of Fort Saskatchewan. The study is still in the early stages, but proposals show that Highway 21 might be realigned so that through traffic would flow from Highway 16 to the new bridge and tie into Highway 28A. The final alignment has not been determined and it is not yet known if it would be designated as part of Highway 21. The proposed bridge and its connecting roads will not be constructed for another 25 to 35 years. There are also long-term plans to upgrade Highway 21 to expressway/freeway standards from the northeast river crossing to Highway 625 as part of a High Load/Heavy Haul bypass connecting Nisku to northeastern Alberta and Fort McMurray.

It was inaugurated and opened to the public on April 19, 2006. The casino, at the time of opening, had around 700 slot machines (expandable to 1,000), 22 gaming tables, 4 bars, 3 restaurants and a theater seating 600. Casino Lisboa is owned by Estoril-Sol, a company majority-owned by Chinese gambling king Stanley Ho, with a minority shareholder with 33%, Amorim. Stanley Ho also owns the same-name Casino Lisboa in Macau. Amorim is a Portuguese conglomerate, with two other casino concessions in Portugal (Figueira da Foz and Tr√≥ia). The CEO of Estoril-Sol is M√°rio Assis Ferreira. Controversies =Location= The casino has been plagued by controversy since it was green-lighted around 2001-2002 by Pedro Santana Lopes, the Lisbon Mayor. The casino was conceived as a way to fund the rebuilding of Parque Mayer, Lisbon's decadent theater district. The fact that it was to be the first casino in the country inside a major urban center (instead of a tourist area) stirred up many negative reactions claiming the casino would create gambling problems, as it would facilitate access of a younger population to games of chance by bringing the games closer to the people. The projected location within the city itself was publicly changed several times after \\"definitive\\" announcements by the Mayor. Withdrawn locations, in succession, were Parque Mayer itself (a project by Frank Gehry that was already underway was suspended), Cais do Sodr√©, Jardim do Tobacco, and Feira Popular, before finally settling on Parque das Na√ß√µes. =Concession= All gambling in Portugal is subject to a concession by the State. For that purpose, the country is divided in gaming zones, each having its own concessionary with usually a single casino. The Lisbon Casino falls within the Estoril gaming zone, and as such, was assigned to the concessionary of that zone. However, other gaming concessionaries protested that since it was a new casino, a new gaming zone should be established and an application process for the concession should be opened. Estoril-Sol and the Portuguese Government argued that, despite usually only one casino by gaming zone being allowed, nothing in the law prevented each zone from having more than one - and, in fact, the Algarve gaming zone set up a precedent, having three casinos. Location The casino took up the former Pavilh√£o do Futuro (Pavilion of the Future), one of the main attractions of the World Expo of '98, which was extensively rebuilt for its new purpose under a project by architect Fernando Jorge Correia. The original architects for the Pavilion (Ana Paula Lopes dos Santos, Miguel Ferreira Guedes de Carvalho and Rui Jorge Garcia Ramos) obtained an injunction to halt construction work on the grounds of copyright violation (due to changes in the fa√ßade and in the structure of the building). A superior court overruled the claim, but the construction work was still halted from January to April 2005. Business =Early figures= The casino was built for 108.9 million Euro, including the 15-year concession fee of ‚Ç¨ 30 million. In the first two months of operation, the casino management repeatedly told the press that business was going better than planned. Target number of daily visitors was 6,000 a day; real numbers were 10,000 in the first 30 days and 7,000 until the end of June 2006. Each visitor spent ‚Ç¨ 90 in gambling. In late June, the casino shifted its opening hours from 3 pm - 3 am to 4 pm - 4 am on weekends (Friday and Saturday). This schedule also applies to eves of holidays. In the first five months of operation, total revenues reached ‚Ç¨ 30.2 million. Target annual turnover was ‚Ç¨ 70 million. 50% of the turnover (intake less prize payouts) reverts to the State as part of the concession terms, but otherwise the company is exempt from the usual income tax laws. In June alone, ‚Ç¨ 14 million were awarded in prizes, for around a 90% payout ratio. Sales on nearby commerce, including the huge Centro Vasco da Gama shopping mall, are reported to have increased overall. =Effects on Estoril Casino= The workers at Estoril Casino, the biggest in Europe, went on strike in January 2005, claiming the opening of the Lisbon Casino, only 35 km away, would reduce the number of clients and threaten their job security. The administration of Estoril-Sol had presented them with a Company Agreement, which said that, if in 36 months, the revenue had gone down due to the Lisbon Casino, they would be able to downsize the workforce. This issue was never fully solved. The company had announced a projected 20% decline in the revenue of the old casino. That decline was announced to have been just 0,9% in the first month, and 15% after five months.

On display at Mid-Continent Railway Museum. The Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railroad , a U.S. railroad offering service from Marquette, Michigan, to nearby locations in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, began operations in 1896. The LS&I; continues to operate as an independent railroad from its headquarters in Marquette. At the end of 1970, LS&I; operated 117 miles of road on 241 miles of track (188 on 388 km); that year it reported 43 million revenue ton-miles (63 t¬∑km) of freight. In 2011, LS&I; had been reduced to of track. History LS&I; Railway Express Agency car \\"J.H.Kline\\" at the National Railroad Museum The Lake Superior and Ishpeming Railway was organized in 1893 as a subsidiary of Cleveland-Cliffs Iron Company (now Cleveland-Cliffs Inc.), the iron ore mining company. From the start the railroad's primary business was the transport of iron ore from the Marquette Iron Range, west of Marquette, to docks on Lake Superior from which the ore could be shipped to steel mills on the lower Great Lakes. The primary towns on the iron range are Ishpeming and Negaunee, Michigan. In 1904 the railroad carried over of freight, and over of that was iron ore. It had 489 ore cars, 14 locomotives, and 121 employees. In 1923 the LS&I; Railway merged with the Munising, Marquette and Southeastern Railway (MM&SE;), a short line running from Marquette east to Munising to form the LS&I; Railroad. The LS&I;'s new spur ran through a section of the Upper Peninsula thickly forested with pulpwood, adding a second commodity to the LS&I;'s workload. The MM&SE;/LS&I; also operated a second spur from Marquette northwest to Big Bay. Passenger operations were never major. In 1904 the railroad carried over 180,000 passenger-miles, compared to over 24 million ton-miles of freight. In 1931 two trains a day ran each way from Munising to Lawson, Marquette and Princeton. One train ran from Marquette to Big Bay and one on the east branch from Munising to Shingleton. By 1940 the Munising-to- Princeton and Lawton-to-Marquette service had been reduced to one train a day each way, and Big Bay service was operating three times a week. This level of service lasted at least to 1950. By 1955 the only passenger service remaining was a single daily train from Munising to Princeton; Marquette and Big Bay were no longer served. All passenger service had been discontinued by 1960. By 1962, diesel locomotives had replaced steam locomotives on the line. The Big Bay spur was sold in the 1960s and Munising operations ended in the 1980s. A line between Humboldt and the Republic Mine was abandoned and railbanked in 2004.Part of the line was reactivated by the Mineral Range Railroad in 2012 for a new mine. As of 2016, the Lake Superior & Ishpeming's primary remaining business continued to be the transport of iron ore over a short line from the Tilden Mine, operated by Cliffs Natural Resources, south of Ishpeming, to Lake Superior for transport. Tonnage was declining sharply due to the shutdown of the adjacent Empire Mine, also historically served by the LS&I.; Engineering The Lake Superior & Ishpeming's historic main line operates on a relatively steep grade, called \\"The Hill\\", from Marquette to the iron mines. The steepest gradient is 1.63%. Because of the location of the LS&I;'s Marquette docks, the railroad must cross the Dead River. The trestle is long and high. Fleet As of 2011, the railroad operated a total of eight General Electric AC4400CW and four GE U30C locomotives. The AC4400CWs, leased from CIT Group, typically operated unit iron ore trains and the U30Cs, purchased from Burlington Northern in the mid-90s, run in yard service at the Presque Isle yard in Marquette. The road formerly operated primarily Alco power, including RS-3's and the famous RSD-15 \\"Alligators\\" purchased from the Santa Fe. Nicknames The LS&I;'s nicknames have included \\"Hayden's Scheme,\\" \\"The Hook and Eye,\\" \\"Little Sally and Imogene\\" (after the names of two daughters of H. R. Harris, its first general manager), and \\"Lazy, Slow, and Independent\\".

Diagrams are provided to illustrate a pendulum located at the North Pole, equator, and 45 degrees N to show how the rotation of Earth in relation to the pendulum is observed, or not, at these locations. This is not a rigorous evaluation but is intended to convey information regarding the interaction of the two moving objects, the swinging pendulum and the rotating Earth. One of the great insights by L√©on Foucault is that the time to observe a full rotation of the Earth increased by the inverse of the sine of the latitude. In the examples, the pendulums are of great size to aid in the visualization of the pendulum swing in relation to the Earth (shown as blue circles). The pendulum is drawn so that 90 degrees of pendulum arc sweeps out 90 degrees of arc on the surface of the Earth. Views from the side, the front, and above (right, center, left) are provided to aid in the interpretation of the diagrams and arrows are provided to show the direction of the Earth's rotation. The schematic at the bottom of the each figure represents the range of swing of the pendulum as viewed from above and normalized to a standard orientation. The smaller arrows depict the magnitude of the relative velocity vector for the point on the Earth's surface in-line with the pendulum bob projected to the center of the Earth (the magnitude is shown since the schematic is two-dimensional, not three-dimensional). The pendulum bob is always affected by the force of gravity directed towards the center of the Earth. The force associated with the connection of the pendulum to a support structure directs the pendulum bob along the swing of the arc. The support structure is dependent on the velocity of the surface of the Earth where it is located. The point of connection of the pendulum moves with the surface velocity vectors of the Earth at that latitude. At the equator the support- point moves with the equatorial rotation of the Earth and moves the pendulum swing along with this rotation. At the poles the support-point is located on the axis of the Earth so the support-point rotates but does not have a horizontal velocity component as it does at the equator (and a progressively less horizontal velocity component with increasing latitude). The plane of the pendulum swing, however, is independent of the surface velocity vectors underneath the swing since there is only one point of connection. The point of connection is configured such that the plane of pendulum swing is free to swing in any direction in relation to the structure of the connection point. The pendulum swing at the poles remains aligned toward a star if not forced to rotate with the support. As a result, it is observable that the Earth turns underneath the plane of swing of the pendulum. Coriolis effect The reason the rotation of the Earth in relation to the pendulum swing increases in time (decreases in effect) with decreasing latitude is related to the Coriolis Effect. As summarized in the Coriolis effect article, the effect is greatest in polar regions where the surface of the Earth is at right angles to the axis of rotation (the central axis of the pendulum aligns with the Earth's axis of rotation). The Coriolis effect decreases nearer the equator because the surface of the Earth is parallel to the axis of rotation (the central axis of the pendulum is perpendicular with the Earth's axis of rotation). Refer to the article discussing the Coriolis Effect for further details. The motion of ballistics with changing latitude is not helpful to understanding the change with latitude of the observed rotation time of the pendulum. (This discussion point is different from what is stated in the reference book.) There is only one point of connection to the Earth for the swinging pendulum and that point of connection doesn't move in relation to the Earth. Because the plane of the pendulum swing is free to swing in relation to the rotation of the structure of the connection point, the rotation of the Earth is observable as directly related to the magnitude of the Coriolis effect. The examples show that the Earth turns underneath the plane of the pendulum swing and how this change in relationship can be interpreted at different latitudes by evaluating the surface velocity components underneath the swing of the pendulum. Polar pendulum For a pendulum swing at the North Pole it is shown that the surface velocity vectors of the Earth underneath one side of the pendulum swing are directed in opposition to the velocity vectors underneath the other side of the swing (see Figure 1). The Earth's rotation can then be observed in relation to the pendulum swing. At the North Pole the support-point of the pendulum swing is located on the axis of rotation of the Earth. No matter what vertical orientation is established by the plane of the swing, the relative velocity vectors of the Earth's surface on opposite sides and equidistant from the center point of the swing will be in opposition. The Earth turns underneath the plane of the pendulum swing that is established. Figure one- Polar Pendulum The support-point of the connection turns with the Earth and is depicted as freely suspended above the Earth. The plane of the pendulum swing does not turn with the support point and is not affected by the turning of the support point. The bob is free to swing in any direction in relation to the support (refer to a Charron chuck). For a pendulum at the pole, the plane of swing remains aligned with a star that the bob is swinging toward. A spot on the bob, however, turns with the support since the bob is not independent of the support point. The spot on the bob does not remain aligned with a star that the bob is swinging toward. This occurs whether the pendulum is swinging or not. If the bob is not allowed to turn with the support-point one twist of the connecting wire will occur in one day at the pole. If the connection apparatus of the pendulum to the bob and to the support were in a fixed relationship (and the connection not allowed to twist, for example, using a rigid rod pinned into place between two sides of the support), then once the plane of the pendulum swing is established in one direction, that plane would be forced to turn with the support and connection. The Earth's rotation would not be observable in relation to the pendulum swing with this type of connection. Equatorial pendulum At the equator the rotation of the Earth is not observable in relation to the pendulum swing because the plane of the pendulum swing is moving along with the rotation of the Earth and no net change in relationship occurs. It is shown by the diagrams that the surface velocity vectors of the Earth underneath the swing of the pendulum are either balanced in the same direction or included within the same plane as the pendulum swing. For the equatorial pendulum with a swing in the longitudinal (north-south) direction the surface velocity vectors on either side of the swing are balanced in the same direction and the center-point of the pendulum swing is moving along with the direction of rotation (see Figure 2A). Figure two (a)--Equatorial pendulum with longitudinal swing For the equatorial pendulum with a swing in the latitudinal direction (along the equator) the surface velocity vectors on either side of the swing are not balanced in the same direction but are acting within the same x-y plane as the pendulum swing (see Figure 2B). These vectors are all of the same magnitude, that of the equatorial velocity. On one side of the pendulum swing the surface velocity vectors are angled upwards but on the opposite side the vectors are angled downwards. Since these vectors are all in the same plane as the pendulum swing there is no change of the surface in relationship to the plane of the pendulum swing. Figure two (b)-Equatorial pendulum with latitudinal swing Information and the pendulum sine law The surface velocity due to the Earth's rotation is a maximum at the Equator and is equal to the circumference (pi √ó the diameter of the Earth) per 24 hours (or 3.14159 √ó 12,756 √∑ 24 = 1670 km/h = 1 equatorial velocity unit, EVU). The time of an Earth's rotation is inversely related to the angular velocity and the surface velocity (T = 1 day for 2 pi radians, or at the equator, 1 circumferential unit per 1 EVU = 40,075 km √∑ 1670 km/h √∑ 24 h/day = 1 day). At a given latitude the surface velocity is equal to pi times the chord length parallel to the equator per 24 hours. This is equivalent to the cosine of the latitude √ó 1 EVU. At the poles the surface velocity is zero since zero distance is traveled. For a given longitude the surface velocity varies from 1 EVU at the equator to zero at the pole even though the angular velocities are all the same. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{velocity \\\\;vector \\\\;at \\\\;a \\\\;given \\\\;latitude} {velocity \\\\;vector \\\\;at \\\\;equator} \\\\end{matrix} = \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{1 \\\\;EVU \\\\;\\\\times \\\\;cosine \\\\;of \\\\;latitude} {1 \\\\;EVU \\\\;\\\\times \\\\;cosine \\\\;of \\\\;zero} \\\\end{matrix} = \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{cosine \\\\;of \\\\;latitude} {1} \\\\end{matrix} The ratio of the surface velocity at two given latitudes is equal to the ratio of the cosine for the two given latitudes. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{velocity \\\\;vector \\\\;at \\\\;latitude \\\\;A} {velocity \\\\;vector \\\\;at \\\\;latitude \\\\;B} \\\\end{matrix} = \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{1 \\\\;EVU \\\\;\\\\times \\\\;cosine \\\\;of \\\\;latitude \\\\;A} {1 \\\\;EVU \\\\;\\\\times \\\\;cosine \\\\;of \\\\;latitude \\\\;B} \\\\end{matrix} = \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{cosine \\\\;of \\\\;latitude \\\\;A} {cosine \\\\;of \\\\;latitude \\\\;B} \\\\end{matrix} The time to observe one full rotation of the Earth in relation to the plane of a swinging pendulum is one day at the poles (the minimum time) and cannot be observed (infinitely long, the maximum time) at the equator. One of the great insights by L√©on Foucault is to deduce that the time to observe a full rotation of the Earth increased by the inverse of the sine of the latitude. (ORTRP = observed rotation time in relation to the plane of the pendulum) \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{ORTRP \\\\;at \\\\;a \\\\;given \\\\;latitude} {ORTRP \\\\;at \\\\;the \\\\;North \\\\;Pole} \\\\end{matrix} = \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{1 \\\\;day \\\\;\\\\times \\\\;sine \\\\;of \\\\;90} {1 \\\\;day \\\\;\\\\times \\\\;sine \\\\;of \\\\;given \\\\;latitude} \\\\end{matrix} = \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{1} {sine \\\\;of \\\\;given \\\\;latitude} \\\\end{matrix} The Pendulum Sine Law also defines that the ratio of the observed Earth's rotation time at two separate latitudes in relation to a pendulum swing is equal to the inverse ratio of the sine of the two latitudes. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{ORTRP \\\\;at \\\\;latitude \\\\;A} {ORTRP \\\\;at \\\\;latitude \\\\;B} \\\\end{matrix} = \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{1 \\\\;day \\\\;\\\\times \\\\;sine \\\\;of \\\\;latitude \\\\;B} {1 \\\\;day \\\\;\\\\times \\\\;sine \\\\;of \\\\;latitude \\\\;A} \\\\end{matrix} = \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{sine \\\\;of \\\\;latitude \\\\;B} {sine \\\\;of \\\\;latitude \\\\;A} \\\\end{matrix} The sine of the latitude also indicates the degree of alignment of the pendulum central axis to the Earth's axis of rotation. At the poles the pendulum axis is parallel or aligned to the Earth's axis and the sine of 90¬∞ = 1. At the equator the pendulum axis is perpendicular to the Earth's axis and the sine of 0¬∞ = 0. At intermediate latitudes the rotation of the Earth is observable in relation to the plane of the pendulum swing but the time to observe a full rotation depends on the latitude of the location. The time to observe a full rotation is equal to one day at the North Pole with the time increasing with decreasing latitude and not observable at the Equator (infinite length of time). The time increases because the central axis of the pendulum is aligned with the axis of rotation of the Earth at the North Pole and then the angle of misalignment increases as the latitude decreases to the point of perpendicularity at the Equator. The angular velocity in relation to the rotation of the Earth's axis that is imparted to the pendulum bob decreases with the cosine of the degree of misalignment of the central axis of the pendulum in comparison to the axis of rotation of the Earth. There are zero degrees of misalignment at the North Pole and the cosine of zero degrees equals 1. There are 90 degrees of misalignment at the Equator and the cosine of 90 degrees equals 0. \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{rotational \\\\;velocity \\\\;vector \\\\;at \\\\;a \\\\;given \\\\;latitude} {rotational \\\\;velocity \\\\;vector \\\\;at \\\\;North \\\\; Pole} \\\\end{matrix} = \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{1 \\\\;RVU \\\\;\\\\times \\\\;cosine \\\\;of \\\\;misalignment} {1 \\\\;RVU \\\\;\\\\times \\\\;cosine \\\\;of \\\\;zero} \\\\end{matrix} = \\\\begin{matrix} \\\\frac{cosine \\\\;of \\\\;misalignment} {1} \\\\end{matrix} This equation is very similar to the equation for the reduction in surface velocity with longitude stated above. This is equivalent to stating that the angular velocity that is imparted to the pendulum bob decreases with the sine of the latitude of the location (the sine of 90 degrees latitude equals 1; the sine of zero degrees latitude equals 0). The time to observe a complete rotation is inversely proportional to the angular velocity that is imparted to the pendulum bob in comparison to the angular velocity of the Earth. The statements above are thus equivalent to the inverse sine law for the observed time for a full rotation of the pendulum in relation to the rotation of the Earth. There is only one point of connection to the Earth for the swinging pendulum and that point of connection doesn't move in relation to the Earth. To approach the Pendulum Sine Law in basic steps: :*The Earth's surface velocity decreases with increasing latitude directly proportional with the cosine of the latitude. :*The degree of alignment of the pendulum axis in comparison to the Earth's axis increases with increasing latitude directly proportional with the sine of the latitude. :*The angular velocity for the Earth is related to the circumferential surface velocity (2 √ó pi radians per day = 40,075 km per day at the equator). :**The observed apparent rotation of the pendulum has an angular velocity (e.g., for the set of points at the end of the pendulum swing). This angular velocity is related to the apparent circumferential surface velocity of the pendulum. :*The time of an Earth's rotation is inversely related to the angular velocity (T = 1 day per 2 √ó pi radians; or as calculated at the equator, 1 circumferential unit per 1 EVU), and inversely related to the circumferential surface velocity of 1 EVU. :**The time to observe a full rotation of the Earth in relation to the plane of the pendulum is inversely related to the angular velocity and inversely related to the apparent circumferential surface velocity. If it is proposed that; :*The angular velocity that is observed for an Earth's rotation in relation to the plane of the pendulum is directly related to the degree of alignment of the pendulum axis to the Earth's axis (Coriolis effect). Then it follows that, :*The angular velocity that is observed for an Earth's rotation in relation to the plane of the pendulum increases with increasing latitude directly proportional with the sine of the latitude. :*The time required to observe an Earth's rotation in relation to the plane of a pendulum decreases with increasing latitude inversely proportional with the sine of the latitude (the Pendulum Sine Law). Forty-five-degrees north pendulum For the 45¬∞ North pendulum with longitudinal swing (Figure 3A) the support point of the pendulum swing is moving along with the direction of rotation and the surface velocity vectors on either side of the swing are not balanced. The rotation of the Earth is observable in relation to the pendulum swing because a change in relationship to the surface occurs. At the south end of the pendulum swing the surface velocity vector (as projected to the center of the Earth) is that of the Equator, equal to 1 EVU. At the north end of the swing the velocity (as projected to the center of the Earth is that of the North Pole, equal to zero since zero distance is traveled in relation to the spinning Earth. Even though the surface velocities are different the angular velocities underneath the pendulum swing are all the same for this orientation. Figure three (a)-Forty- five-degrees north pendulum with longitudinal swing For the 45¬∞ North pendulum with latitudinal swing (Figure 3B) the support point of the pendulum swing is moving along with the direction of rotation and the surface velocity vectors on either side of the swing are not balanced. The rotation of the Earth is observable in relation to the pendulum swing because a change in relationship to the surface occurs. On one side of the pendulum swing the surface velocity vectors are angled upwards and to the side but on the other side the vectors are angled downwards and to the opposite side. Since these vectors are not all in the same plane as the pendulum swing and are not balanced in the same direction there is a change in relationship between the surface and the plane of the pendulum swing. Figure three (b)-Forty-five-degrees north pendulum with latitudinal swing :Note: The schematic directly underneath the front view of the pendulum diagram is for velocity vectors projected towards the center of the Earth rather than straight down. It is much easier to interpret the magnitude of the vectors using the straight down projection that is shown on the right side of the diagram (the view from the top). Evaluation of surface velocity vectors The surface velocity vectors underneath the swing of the pendulum can be separated into three components (x, y, and z) for the 3-dimensional system in order to evaluate the vectors on opposite sides of the pendulum. The evaluation is to identify whether the vectors on each side of the pendulum swing are 1) balanced in the same direction, 2) acting in the same plane, or 3) unbalanced or in opposing directions. If the vector components on opposite sides of the pendulum swing are balanced in the same direction or act in the same plane of the pendulum then the rotation of the Earth will not be observable in relation to the swing of the pendulum. If the plane of the pendulum swing establishes the x-y plane then the z-component determines when the Earth's rotation will be observable and only if the z-component is not balanced in the same direction on each side. The magnitude of the opposing component is proportional to how long it takes for one full turn of the Earth to be observed in relation to the plane of the pendulum. The length of time is a minimum of one day at the poles, increases from the pole to the equator, and is not visible at the equator (infinitely long). For any two points in the pendulum swing that are equidistant from the center of the swing there are two related points projected onto the surface of the Earth. These points can be used to determine the corresponding surface velocity components that are in opposition and not acting in the same plane of the swing. The magnitude of the difference between these two points (for a given latitude of the center-point) is a relative measure of the time to observe one full rotation. The ratio of the velocity vector difference to the corresponding points at the North Pole with the same equidistance from the center of the swing and the same projection to the surface can then be determined. The inverse ratio will determine the time observed for one full rotation of the pendulum swing in comparison to the duration at the pole of one day. From the diagrams two points of the pendulum swing can be chosen to project straight down to two points on opposite sides of the Earth (180¬∞ apart). This makes it easy to obtain the velocity vector difference and then the time observed for a full rotation from the inverse ratio. The examples show that the Earth turns underneath the plane of the pendulum swing and how this change in relationship can be interpreted at different latitudes. :*For the North Pole pendulum (Figure 1) the velocity vector by inspection is 1 EVU on one side of the swing (as projected to the equator) and 1 EVU in the opposite direction on the other side of the swing. The difference between these two points is 2 EVU for the North Pole pendulum. :*Using the same projection for the equatorial pendulum with longitudinal swing (Figure 2A) the velocity vector is 0 EVU on one side of the swing (for the North Pole) and 0 EVU on the other side of the swing (for the South Pole). The difference between these two points is 0 EVU for this arrangement. The time to observe a full rotation is infinitely long since the ratio divides by zero. For any two equidistant points the difference between the two vectors is zero, meaning the vectors are balanced in the same direction on each side of the pendulum swing. :*Using the same projection for the equatorial pendulum with latitudinal swing (Figure 2B) the velocity vector is 1 EVU on each side of the swing and are in opposite directions. Even though the difference in the velocity vectors is 2 EVU, these vectors are acting in the same plane as the pendulum, therefore, cannot be observed by the pendulum swing. The z-component determines when the Earth's rotation will be observable and these are both zero. :*Using the same projection for the 45¬∞ North pendulum with longitudinal swing (Figure 3A) the velocity vector is 0.707 EVU on one side of the (corresponding to 45¬∞ North on the opposite side of the world from the center point) and 0.707 EVU in the opposite direction on the other side of the swing (corresponding to 45¬∞ South). The difference between these two vectors is 1.414 EVU. :*Using the same projection for the 45¬∞ North pendulum with longitudinal swing (Figure 3B) the velocity vector is 1 EVU but the z-component is only 0.707 EVU since the x-y plane is at 45¬∞on one side of the swing (corresponding to the equator). On the other side of the swing the velocity vector is 0.707 EVU in the opposite direction (corresponding to the equator with a tilt of 45¬∞ to the x-y plane). The difference between these two vectors is 1.414 EVU. ::*The ratio of the velocity vectors for 45¬∞ to that of the pole is 1.414 √∑ 2.0 which equals 0.707. The time to observe the full rotation is then the inverse, or 1.414 days for a pendulum at 45¬∞ on the Earth. Relative motion of the plane of the pendulum swing to the surface of the Earth In order to observe the rotation of the Earth in relation to the plane of the pendulum swing there must be a basic difference in the two types of motion that are being compared. This basic difference is then manifested as (1) being able to 'observe' the change in position of the Earth in relation to the pendulum swing and (2) the time to observe a complete 'relative rotation' decreases with the sine of the latitude (decreases with an increase in the angle of alignment with the Earth's axis of rotation). At the North Pole: The central axis of the pendulum aligns with the axis of rotation of the Earth. The central axis of the pendulum is always determined by the force of gravity directed towards the center of the Earth. A pendulum bob at rest at the North Pole still has spin on the bob. ::If a pendulum bob is hanging vertically at the North Pole and held in place, the bob is stationary but is rotating (spinning) with the Earth. Once the bob is released (but not swinging) it will continue to rotate (spin) unless one stops the rotation (spin) by forcing a spot on the side of the bob to always line up or point to one star. If the rotation of the bob is stopped then the connection wire will twist one turn every day unless there is a connection that is free to rotate (spin) (at either end of the wire or the support structure). If the bob at the North Pole is allowed to continue to rotate (spin) then it will and the wire won't twist one turn in one day. The Foucault pendulum connection is constructed such that the pendulum is free to swing in any direction. ::This is not the same thing as the support connection being free to rotate (spin). The swing of the pendulum is different from the rotation (spin) of the bob. ::If a pendulum is hanging at the North Pole, before the bob is released, the bob is stationary but is rotating (spinning) with the Earth. Once the bob is released it will continue to rotate (spin) unless one stops the rotation (spinning) by forcing a spot on the side of the bob to always line up or point to one star. If the bob is displaced from the central axis of the pendulum in preparation for swinging and held in place, then the bob will revolve about the central axis of the pendulum along with the rotation of the Earth and has an angular velocity equal to that of the Earth's angular velocity. ::Before the bob is released there is a force that is exerted through the holding point of the bob that causes the bob to revolve about the pendulum axis and rotate (turn) with the Earth. This is because the holding point is attached to the surface of the Earth just like the structure of the pendulum is attached to the Earth. Once the bob is displaced from the central axis of the pendulum and then released there no longer is a force acting on the bob that causes it to revolve about the central axis of the pendulum and rotate (turn) with the Earth. ::As observed from an end-view of the swinging bob, the swing of the bob will always line up or swing towards one star (just like the axis of the Earth points at one star for the time periods considered) as the bob swings through the central axis of the pendulum. There can be a slight ellipsoid swing if the initial conditions of angular motion are not cancelled but there is no longer a force acting on the bob causing it to have an angular velocity after the bob is released. The plane of the swing of the pendulum bob is now independent of the surface of the earth which was imparting a force to the bob before it was released (through the holding point). As noted previously, the bob is still spinning with the Earth (a spot of the bob will spin with the Earth), even though the bob is no longer turning with the Earth. Thus the Earth continues to turn underneath the swing of the pendulum while the swing of the pendulum remains in a fixed plane that doesn't rotate (turn). The point of significance is that the force imparting an angular velocity to the pre-released bob is no longer acting on the swinging bob. At the North Pole, this force takes one day for the direction of the force to complete a full circle since it takes one day for the Earth to rotate. At the equator: The central axis of the pendulum is perpendicular with the axis of rotation of the Earth. The central axis of the pendulum is always determined by the force of gravity directed towards the center of the Earth. A pendulum bob at rest at the Equator is still rotating with the Earth and there is no spin on the bob. ::The pendulum is moving with the rotation of the Earth when located at the equator, as is the support structure, so one can't see the rotation of the Earth in relation to the pendulum. The observation of the relative motion of the Earth in relation to the pendulum depends on the location of the surface of the Earth where the initial conditions are established. ::If a pendulum bob is hanging vertically at the Equator and held in place, the bob is stationary relative to the Earth and is rotating (turning) with the Earth. Once the bob is released (but not swinging) it continues to rotate (turn) with the Earth. If the bob is displaced from the central axis of the pendulum in preparation for swinging and held in place, then the bob is still rotating (turning) with the Earth with the same angular velocity equal to that of the Earth's angular velocity. This is the same angular velocity when at rest. Since the central axis of the pendulum is perpendicular with the axis of rotation of the Earth this is not the same as the North Pole where the central axis is aligned with the axis of the Earth. The bob is not revolving about the axis of the pendulum when held in place. ::Before the bob is released there is a force that is exerted through the holding point of the bob that causes the bob to rotate (turn) with the Earth. This is because the holding point is attached to the surface of the Earth just like the structure of the pendulum is attached to the Earth. Once the bob is displaced from the central axis of the pendulum and then released there is still the same force acting on the bob that causes it to rotate (turn) with the Earth. ::As observed from an end-view of the swinging bob, the swing of the bob will not line up or swing towards one star as the bob swings through the central axis of the pendulum. There will not be a slight ellipsoid swing in relation to the Earth since the initial conditions of angular motion are not changed and there is still a force acting on the bob (transmitted through the support structure, pendulum wire, and gravity) causing it to have an angular velocity after the bob is released. The plane of the swing of the pendulum bob is independent of the surface of the earth but is not independent of the pendulum system which is still imparting the same force to the bob as before it was released through the single support point of the pendulum. As noted previously, there is no spin on the bob (a spot of the bob does not change with respect to the Earth) and the bob is not revolving about the axis of the pendulum. Thus the Earth continues to turn underneath the swing of the pendulum and the swing of the pendulum continues to turn with the Earth since there is still a force acting on the bob of the pendulum swing. The point of significance is that the same forces imparting an angular velocity to the pre- released bob are still acting on the swinging bob. At the Equator, the relative motion of the Earth is not observable because there is no change in the force imparting an angular velocity to the bob. This is because the central axis of the pendulum is perpendicular with the axis of rotation of the Earth. ::For a separate, imaginative arrangement, if one could imagine a large pendulum structure that is mounted at the North Pole and free to not rotate with Earth (e.g., mounted on a platform that is free of the rotation (spin) of the Earth) but has long arms that allows the pendulum to swing at the Equator then the Earth's surface would move underneath the pendulum. The Earth doesn't rotate (turn) under the pendulum swing like at the North Pole but the equatorial plane rotates perpendicular to the pendulum swing. This is a very large pendulum and an idealized situation. At intermediate latitudes: The rotation of the Earth is observable in relation to the plane of the pendulum swing but the time to observe a full rotation depends on the latitude of the location. The time to observe a full rotation is equal to one day at the North Pole with the time increasing with decreasing latitude and not observable at the Equator (infinite length of time). ::The time increases because the central axis of the pendulum is aligned with the axis of rotation of the Earth at the North Pole and then the angle of misalignment increases as the latitude decreases to the point of perpendicularity at the Equator. ::The angular velocity that is imparted to the pendulum bob about the axis of the pendulum prior to release decreases with the cosine of the degree of misalignment of the central axis of the pendulum in comparison to the axis of rotation of the Earth (zero degrees of misalignment at the North Pole, cosine of zero degrees equals 1; 90 degrees of misalignment at the Equator, cosine of 90 degrees equals 0). ::This is equivalent to stating that the angular velocity that is imparted to the pendulum bob prior to release decreases with the sine of the latitude of the location (the sine of 90 degrees latitude equals 1; the sine of zero degrees latitude equals 0). ::When the bob is released there is no longer a force acting on the bob causing it to revolve about the central axis of the pendulum. That force that is no longer applied is less than that applied at the North Pole where axis are fully aligned. ::The time to observe a complete rotation of the Earth is inversely proportional to the angular velocity that is not imparted to the pendulum bob. The statements above are thus equivalent to the inverse sine law for the observed time for a full rotation of the pendulum in relation to the rotation of the Earth. Final Note: There is only one point of connection to the Earth for the swinging pendulum and that point of connection doesn't move in relation to the Earth.

Aircraft fuel dump Aircraft have two major types of weight limits: the maximum takeoff weight and the maximum structural landing weight, with the maximum structural landing weight almost always being the lower of the two. This allows an aircraft on a normal, routine flight to take off at the higher weight, consume fuel en route, and arrive at a lower weight. It is the abnormal, non-routine flight where landing weight can be a problem. If a flight takes off at the maximum takeoff weight and then must land well before its destination, even returning immediately after takeoff to the departure airport (for example, because of mechanical problems or a passenger medical problem), it will contain more fuel than was intended for landing. If an aircraft lands at more than its maximum allowable weight, it might suffer structural damage or even break apart on landing. As jets began flying in the US in late 1950s and early 1960s, the FAA rule in effect at the time mandated that if the ratio between an aircraft's maximum structural takeoff weight and its maximum structural landing weight was greater than 1.05, the aircraft had to have a fuel-dump system installed. Aircraft such as the Boeing 707 and 727 and the Douglas DC-8 had fuel dump systems. Any of those aircraft needing to return to a takeoff airport above the maximum landing weight would jettison an amount of fuel sufficient to reduce the aircraft's weight below that maximum landing weight limit, and then land. During the 1960s, Boeing introduced the 737, and Douglas introduced the DC-9, the original models of each being for shorter routes; the 105% figure was not an issue, thus they had no fuel-dump systems installed. During the 1960s and 1970s, both Boeing and Douglas \\"grew\\" their respective aircraft as far as operational capabilities were concerned via Pratt & Whitney's development of increasingly powerful variants of the JT8D engines that powered both aircraft series. Both aircraft were now capable of longer duration flights, with increased weight limits, and complying with the existing 105% rule became problematic due to the costs associated with adding a fuel-dump system to aircraft in production. Considering the more powerful engines that had been developed, the FAA changed the rules to delete the 105% requirement, and FAR 25.1001 was enacted stating a jettison system was not required if the climb requirements of FAR 25.119 (Landing Climb) and FAR 25.121 (Approach Climb) could be met, assuming a 15-minute flight. In other words, for a go-around with full landing flaps and all engines operating, and at approach flap setting and one engine inoperative, respectively. Since most twin jet airliners can meet these requirements, most aircraft of this type such as the Boeing 737 (all models), the DC-9/MD80 and Boeing 717, the A320 family and various regional jet (\\"RJ\\") aircraft do not have fuel dump systems installed. In the event of an emergency requiring a return to the departure airport, the aircraft circles nearby in order to consume fuel to get down to within the maximum structural landing weight limit, or, if the situation demands, simply lands overweight without delay. Modern aircraft are designed with possible overweight landings in mind, but this is not done except in cases of emergency, and various maintenance inspections are required afterwards. Long-range twin jets such as the Boeing 767 and the Airbus A300, A310, and A330 may or may not have fuel dump systems, depending upon how the aircraft was ordered, since on some aircraft they are a customer option. Three- and four-engine jets like the Lockheed L-1011, McDonnell Douglas DC-10 / MD-11, Boeing 747 and Airbus A340 usually have difficulty meeting the requirements of FAR 25.119 near maximum structural takeoff weight, thus most of those have jettison systems. A Boeing 757 has no fuel-dump capability as its maximum landing weight is similar to the maximum take-off weight. Fuel-dumping operations are coordinated with air traffic control, and precautions are taken to keep other aircraft clear of such areas. Fuel dumping is usually accomplished at a high enough altitude (minimum 6,000 feet, AGL), where the fuel will dissipate before reaching the ground. Fuel leaves the aircraft through a specific point on each wing, usually closer to the wingtips and farther away from engines, and initially appears as more liquid than vapor. A large-scale fuel dumping occurred on September 11, 2001, when U.S. airspace was closed due to the September 11 attacks. International flights en route to the U.S. were either turned back to their point of origin or diverted to land in Canada and other countries. Many of these flights were fuelled for travel well into the American interior; for those mid-flight aircraft unable to land due to excessive fuel weight, dumping was necessary. =Dump rates= It is difficult to quote specific dump rates even for specific types of aircraft since the dumped fuel is not pumped but delivered by gravity feed so as to be more independent of electrical systems, which might be unavailable in a fuel-dump scenario. This means the actual rate depends on the pressure exerted by the fuel head: the more fuel on board, the higher the rate at which it flows out. This also means that the dump rate is not constant, but decreases while dumping because the fuel head and its pressure decrease.

Air traffic control, after receiving information by the pilots executing the dumping procedure, usually separates other traffic by 2,000 feet vertically and laterally, since the dumped vapours if ingested by a jet engine might cause serious problems to the engine's normal operation. Dump-and-burn RAAF F-111 performing a dump-and- burn A dump-and-burn is a fuel dump in which the fuel is ignited, intentionally, using the plane's afterburner. A spectacular flame combined with high speed makes this a popular display for air shows or as a finale to fireworks. Dump-and-burns are also referred to as \\"torching\\" or \\"zippos\\". General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark's dump and burn is so powerful that it can set a runway on fire, as the flame burns rubber from skid marks. The aircraft has been used for this purpose in Australia during the closing ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympicshttp://www.defence.gov.au/media/DepartmentalTpl.cfm?CurrentId=357 and (until 2010) regularly at Brisbane's Riverfestival and the Australian Grand Prix. The F-111 is ideally suited to perform the dump-and-burn maneuver, as the fuel dump nozzle on this aircraft is located between the engine exhausts.

He is best known for his stage musicals and for his two seasons as a satirist on CBC TV's The Journal, as well as an author, speaker and social critic on cultural- political issues. Bio Born in Ottawa, Ontario, and raised in Nova Scotia, Gray obtained a B.A. at Mount Allison University, and an M.A. at the University of British Columbia. While attending the latter, he founded Tamahnous Theatre, and served as its director from 1971 to 1974. He then joined Theatre Passe Muraille in Toronto, Ontario, where he began writing and composing for the stage. His first musical was \\"18 Wheels,\\" about truck drivers. Plays In 1978, with Eric Peterson, he wrote and composed Billy Bishop Goes to War, which appeared on Broadway in New York City in 1980, produced by Mike Nichols, and in London's West End. It has since been performed in over 150 independent productions in Canada and the United States. The play appeared on television in a BBC-CBC co-production, and in a German version, Billy Bishop Steig Auf. Billy Bishop Goes to War was the winner of the Los Angeles Drama Critics Award in 1981, the Governor General's Award for Drama, and the 1982 Floyd S. Chalmers Canadian Play Award. In 2009, Peterson and Gray returned to their roles at Soulpepper Theater in Toronto, in a re- mounting where Bishop tells his story, wearing pajamas and dressing-gown, near the end of his life. Directed by Ted Dykstra, the production received rave reviews, and continues to be performed at Soulpepper and at other venues across Canada. In 2010, the play was shot for CBC Television in partnership with Strada Productions, directed by Barbara Willis-Sweete. Musicals Gray has written and composed six other musicals including 18 Wheels, Rock and Roll, Don Messer's Jubilee, Health, and Amelia: The Girl Who Wants to Fly (2011). Rock and Roll won a Dora Mavor Moore Award in 1982, and became an award-winning feature video entitled King of Friday Night. Gray's most recent television musical is TheTree. TheTower. TheFlood, three Bible stories for the age of information, commissioned by CBC Radio Drama. Newspaper columnist In the late 1990s, Gray became a newspaper columnist, contributing weekly pieces on cultural politics to the Vancouver Sun and The Globe and Mail. In the early 2000s he contributed a column to Western Living Magazine called \\"O For the Love of Dog,\\" in which he wrote about his dog Gus. Novelist Around that time he abandoned the theatre in favour of the novel ‚Äì in a series of thrillers set in post-modern Vancouver, mid-19th century England and the United States before the Civil War. As with Billy Bishop Goes to War, Gray casts an ironic contemporary eye on imagined historical events. He is the recipient of a Golden Globe, and the Governor General's Medal. In 2000, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada for \\"his contribution to Canada's cultural landscape\\". He holds honorary doctorates from Dalhousie University and Mount Allison University. John Gray lives in Vancouver, British Columbia with his wife Beverlee. They have two sons, Zachary (a musician and actor) and Ezra ( a visual artist).

Metal deactivators, or metal deactivating agents (MDA) are fuel additives and oil additives used to stabilize fluids by deactivating (usually by sequestering) metal ions, mostly introduced by the action of naturally occurring acids in the fuel and acids generated in lubricants by oxidative processes with the metallic parts of the systems. Fuels desulfurized by copper sweetening also contain a significant trace amounts of copper. Metal deactivators inhibit the catalytic effects of such ions, especially copper, retarding the formation of gummy residues (e.g. gels containing copper mercaptide).Metal Deactivators Even concentrations of copper as low as 0.1 ppm can have detrimental effects. An example of a metal deactivator used for gasoline and jet fuels is salpn. It is used in turbine and jet fuels, diesel, heating oil, and greases.

It is named for John Adams, the second president, who signed the law creating the Library of Congress. The building is in the Capitol Hill district of Washington D.C. next to the Library's main building (the Thomas Jefferson Building). It opened to the public on January 3, 1939, and was long known as The Annex building. The annex was built in a restrained but very detailed Art Deco style and faced in white Georgia marble. It is located on Second Street SE between Independence Avenue and East Capitol Street in Washington, DC. History Adams Building - South Reading Room, with murals by Ezra Winter Exterior detail near an entrance The idea to construct a new library building was presented to the United States Congress in 1928 at the urging of Librarian of Congress Herbert Putnam. The bill was sponsored by U.S. Representative Robert Luce, chairman of the House Committee on the Library. On June 13, 1930, $6.5 million was appropriated for the building's construction, for a tunnel connecting it to the Main Building, and for changes in the east front of the Main Building, including the construction of a Rare Book Room. An additional appropriation approved on June 6, 1935, brought the total authorization to $8,226,457. Architect of the Capitol David Lynn took charge of the project and commissioned the Washington, D.C. architectural firm of Pierson & Wilson to design the building, with Alexander Buel Trowbridge as consulting architect. The contract stipulated completion by June 24, 1938, but the building was not ready for occupancy until December 2, 1938. The move of the Card Division started on December 12, and it opened to the public in the new building on January 3, 1939. The building is five stories in height above ground, with the fifth story set back . It contains of shelving (compared to in the Jefferson Building) and can hold ten million volumes. There are 12 tiers of stacks, extending from the cellar to the fourth floor. Each tier provides about of shelf space. On April 13, 1976, in a ceremony at the Jefferson Memorial marking the birthday of Thomas Jefferson, President Gerald Ford signed into law the act to change the name of the Library of Congress Building to the Library of Congress Thomas Jefferson Building. On June 13, 1980, the Adams building acquired its present name, which honors John Adams, the former President of the United States who in 1800 approved the law establishing the Library of Congress. The building is faced in white Georgia marble and incorporated the use of new materials at the time such as acoustical block, formica, vitrolit, and glass tubing.

The original doors are set in a \\"hold-open\\" position within each entryway, flanking the new monumental doors made by the Washington Glass Studio and Fireart Glass. The south entrance doors (not currently used) facing Independence Avenue are reached by a stairway decorated with stylized owls and lamps.

Gandbhir and Rayi point out Viraj N. Gandbhir; Appaji Rayi. Trendelenburg gait. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK541094/ Accessed June 4 2020. that the biomechanical action involved comprises a Class 3 lever, where the lower limb's weight is the load, the hip joint is the fulcrum, and the lateral glutei, which attach to the antero-lateral surface of the greater trochanter of the femur, provide the effort. The causes can thus be categorized systematically as failures of this lever system at various points. Causes *Damage to the motor nerve supply of the lateral glutei (Gluteus medius and Minimus) **Poliomyelitis involving L5 or L5 radiculopathy (foot drop may also be seen because L5 innervates the Tibialis anterior). **Damage to the Superior gluteal nerve. *Temporary or permanent weakness of the lateral glutei **Tendinitis **Penetrating injury **Infection, abscess ‚Äì blood borne, post- traumatic or post-surgical. *Ineffective action (insufficient leverage) of the lateral glutei **Greater trochanteric avulsion **Fracture, (or non-union) of the femoral neck **Coxa Vara (the angle between the femoral neck head and shaft is less than 120 degrees) *Damage to the hip joint (fulcrum) - Chronic or Developmental Hip Dislocation/Dysplasia **Osteonecrosis ** Legg-Calve- Perthes disease, **developmental dysplasia **chronic infection **uncorrected traumatic dislocation. Description of Gait During the stance phase, or when standing on one leg, the weakened abductor muscles allow the pelvis to tilt down on the opposite side. To compensate, the trunk lurches to the weakened side to attempt to maintain a level pelvis throughout the gait cycle. When the hip abductor muscles (gluteus medius and minimus) are weak or ineffective, the stabilizing effect of these muscles during gait is lost. Thus, when standing on the right leg, if the left hip drops, it is a positive right Trendelenburg sign (the opposite side drops because the hip abductors on the right side do not stabilize the pelvis to prevent the droop). When the patient walks, if he swings his body to the right to compensate for left hip drop, he will present with a compensated Trendelenburg gait; the patient exhibits an excessive lean in which the upper body is thrust to the right to keep the center of gravity over the stance leg. Treatment Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. In addition, Biofeedback and physical therapy are used to strengthen the muscles.

Etymology is Spanish for 'shark'. Although the Seri name, , was first recorded by Alphonse Pinart in 1879, its etymology is unknown. left Geography Tibur√≥n Island is part of the Mexican state of Sonora, as well as the Hermosillo Municipality, and is located at approximately the same latitude as the city of Hermosillo. It is located along the eastern shore of the Gulf of California, opposite Isla √Ångel de la Guarda. It is part of the chain of islands known as the Midriff Islands or Islas Grandes. History Tibur√≥n Island is part of the traditional homeland of some bands (or clans) of the Seri people, for many centuries if not millennia. During the 1960s and early 1970s, a small hunting and fishing camp on the northern end of the island was operated by Jesus Olivas, a resident of Hermosillo. He constructed several buildings, a dock and an airstrip near the historic Seri encampment at Tecomate. The camp was popular with American visitors to the area. The remains of the structures and airstrip are still in place (although the airstrip was rendered unusable by the Mexican military around 1995 in an attempt to keep it from being used by smugglers active in the area at the time). The Mexican government, through a decree by President Echeverr√≠a, gave the Seri \\"recognition and title of communal property\\" () with respect to Tibur√≥n Island in 1975. The island is uninhabited (except for Mexican military encampments on the eastern and southern shores of the island) and is administered as an ecological preserve by the Seri tribal government in conjunction with the federal government. Bighorn sheep were introduced to the island in the 1980s; hunting is managed by the tribal government in coordination with Mexican federal authorities. It is also home to subspecies of coyote (Canis latrans jamesi) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus sheldoni) that are found nowhere but the island. Transportation The island can be reached from Punta Chueca, which is the nearest community inhabited by members of the Seri tribe, and from Bah√≠a de Kino, a non-Seri community to the south. The distance from Punta Chueca to Punta Tormenta, the nearest point on the island, is . The channel between the mainland and the island is called ('Tiny Hell's Channel') because of the strong tidal currents and shoal water that occur there which can make navigation challenging. The island has a prominent mountain system of volcanic origin. left Recreation Two permits are required for day hiking and overnight stays on the island: one from the Seri Governor's office in Punta Chueca and another from the ISLAS office in Bah√≠a de Kino. In popular culture In 2012, two television episodes of Survivorman were filmed on Tibur√≥n Island, featuring Les Stroud as he spends ten days living on the island.

Although he came to the University of Michigan to study dentistry, he soon became involved with Wilson's Wolverines‚Äîa jazz band with a more than local following. He toured Europe with them for several years and later returned to the States only to be recruited by Glen Gray's Casa Loma Orchestra of Detroit, one of the important society orchestras of the period. He later earned a Doctor of Music from the Detroit Institute of Musical Arts in 1943. Teal carved out his own niche in Detroit's musical life. He was a member of radio station WJR's live studio orchestra and he was a member of the Detroit Symphony Orchestra (DSO) from 1943 to 1964. Not only did he play sax, as one might expect, but he also performed on clarinet and was the DSO's first desk flutist, a rare enough feat then and almost unheard of now. Additionally, he opened his own music studio and staffed it with players from the orchestra. It was one of the most reputable, demanding and prestigious of its kind in the country.

The clitellates comprise around 8,000 species. Unlike the class of Polychaeta, they do not have parapodia and their heads are less developed. Characteristics Clitellate annelids are segmented worms characterised by the clitellum or girdle which is located near the head end of mature individuals. The mouth is on the ventral surface and is overhung by the prostomium (proboscis). The brain is not located in the head but in one of the body segments. The clitellum is formed by a modification of several segments, and either includes the female gonopores or is located just behind them. During copulation, this glandular tissue secretes mucus that keeps the paired individuals together while they exchange sperm. Afterwards it secretes material that forms a cocoon that encircles the animal's body and encloses the eggs and sperm. The animal works this cocoon forward and over its head end, whereupon the ends of the cocoon become sealed, with fertilisation and development taking place inside. Earthworms and their kin, in the subclass Oligochaeta, lack eyes but have photoreceptor cells in the skin, especially in the dorsal portion of the anterior end. They also lack parapodia and appendages on the prostomium, the body and the periproct (terminal segment on which the anus is located). The gonads are located in a few segments near the clitellum, with the testes being anterior to the ovaries. There are four bundles of one to twenty-five chaetae on each segment; these have muscles attached to their bases and can be extended or retracted. Leeches and their relatives, in the subclass Hirudinea, mostly have flattened bodies, usually tapered at both ends. They have a fixed number of segments, 33, but the segmentation is not visible externally because the cuticle is marked with annulations. Leeches do not bear chaetae. The front few segments or head have been modified into a sucker that usually surrounds the mouth. These segments usually bear several ocelli on the upper side. The clitellum occupies segments 9 to 11 but is only noticeable during breeding periods. The hindermost segments form another, larger, disc-shaped sucker located on the underside of the body. The anus is on the dorsal surface just in front of the posterior sucker. The body wall includes strong transverse, longitudinal and diagonal muscles which give the animal great flexibility and extensibility.  Distribution and habitat  Clitellates live on land, in freshwater or in the ocean. The subclass Branchiobdellae includes tiny species which crawl over the surface of freshwater crustaceans, especially crayfish. The leeches in subclass Hirudinea are mostly aquatic, a few living in the sea but mostly inhabiting freshwater locations, particularly the sediments on the bottom of lakes, ponds and sluggish streams. They thrive in polluted waters and places with high quantities of decaying organic matter and may be very numerous. They are more abundant in temperate waters in the northern hemisphere than elsewhere. The subclass Oligochaeta, which includes the earthworms as the largest members of the group, mostly live on land, burrowing in damp soil. Smaller freshwater species burrow in mud or live among aquatic vegetation. The marine species are mostly tiny and live in the interstices between sand grains, from the intertidal zone to the deep sea.  Reproduction  All clitellata are hermaphrodites. During copulation, the clitellum produces a mucus that holds worms in place whilst they mate. During reproduction, the clitellum secretes a yolk (albumen) and a proteinaceous sheath which hardens. The worm then creeps out backward from the coat and deposits either fertilized zygotes or both ovae and sperm into the coat, which is then packed into a cocoon. The zygotes then develop directly in the cocoon without passing through a larval stage (as opposed to other annelids, e.g. Polychaeta.) This mechanism is considered to be apomorphic (a newly derived characteristic rather than an evolutionarily ancestral one).Reichardt (2006): pp.63, 67-68  Systematics  According to modern phylogenetic analyses, the Clitellata are considered to be a monophyletic clade embedded deep in the polychaetes. Historically, the group was classified into the subclasses Oligochaeta and the Hirudinea. The oligochaetes contained the tubificids (Naididae, Lumbricidae, and Lumbriculidae - commonly the tube worms and the earthworms. The Hirudinea contained the leeches and the branchiobdellids. Modern analysis has revealed Branchiobdella and Hirudinea are two sister groups to the lumbriculids and they are daughter groups to the tree of oligochaetes. * Branchiobdella - formerly in Hirudinea * Hirudinea (leeches) * Oligochaeta (earthworms - aquatic microdriles and terrestrial megadriles) The Acanthobdellidea, a sister group to Hirudinea, are sometimes moved out of the Hirudinea as a distinct subclass, too. Overall, clitellate phylogeny is not well resolved. Namely, the Acanthobdellidea, Branchiobdella and Hirudinea are monophyletic, but are embedded among the Oligochaeta, which are an evolutionary grade of lineages that are outwardly similar, but not very close relatives. In particular, the leeches and earthworms appear to be very close relatives. Two approaches are possible:Ers√©us et al. (2008) * abolish Oligochaeta as traditionally delimited in favor of a number of smaller monophyletic lineages * treat Oligochaeta and Clitellata as synonymous while splitting up the traditional \\"oligochaetes\\" into monophyletic lineages.

The decree creating this army appeared in the Plan de Iguala, which stated the three guarantees which it was meant to defend: religion, independence, and unity. Mexico was to be a Catholic empire, independent from Spain, and united against its enemies. History The Army of the Three Guarantees was created on February 24, 1821, and continued battling Spanish royalist forces which refused to accept Mexican independence. These battles continued until August 1821, when Iturbide and Spanish Viceroy Juan de O'Donoj√∫ signed the Treaty of C√≥rdoba, virtually ratifying Mexico's independence. The Army was a decisive force during the Battle of Azcapotzalco. The victory in this last battle of the war cleared the way to Mexico City. On September 27, 1821, the Army of the Three Guarantees triumphantly entered Mexico City, led by Iturbide. The following day Mexico was declared independent. By that time, the Army of the Three Guarantees was composed of 7,616 infantrymen, 7,755 cavalry, 763 artillery with 68 cannons.

With over 1 billion tires manufactured worldwide annually, the tire industry is a major consumer of natural rubber. Tire factories start with bulk raw materials such as synthetic rubber (60% -70% of total rubber in the tire industry), carbon black, and chemicals and produce numerous specialized components that are assembled and cured. right The tire is an assembly of numerous components that are built up on a drum and then cured in a press under heat and pressure. Heat facilitates a polymerization reaction that crosslinks rubber monomers to create long elastic molecules. Inner liner The inner liner is a calandered halobutyl rubber sheet compounded with additives that result in low air permeability. The inner liner assures that the tire will hold high-pressure air inside, without an inner tube, minimizing diffusion through the rubber structure. Body ply The body ply is a calendered sheet consisting of one layer of rubber, one layer of reinforcing fabric, and a second layer of rubber. The earliest textile used was cotton; later materials include rayon, nylon, polyester, and Kevlar. Passenger tires typically have one or two body plies. Body plies give the tire structure strength. Truck tires, off-road tires, and aircraft tires have progressively more plies. The fabric cords are highly flexible but relatively inelastic. Side Sidewalls are non- reinforced extruded profiles with additives to give the sides of the tire good abrasion resistance and environmental resistance. Additives used in sidewall compounds include antioxidants and antiozonants. Sidewall extrusions are nonsymmetrical and provide a thick rubber area to enable molding of raised letters. The sidewalls give the tire resistance against the environment. Sidewall plays an important role in strengthening of tire. Light Side wall defect while curing press cure tyre rubber not flow in HP stage & external pressure came inside that time rubber flowing in die stop. Beads Beads are bands of high tensile-strength steel wire encased in a rubber compound. Bead wire is coated with special alloys of bronze or brass. Coatings protect the steel from corrosion. Copper in the alloy and sulfur in the rubber cross-link to produce copper sulfide, which improves bonding of the bead to the rubber. Beads are inflexible and inelastic, and provide the mechanical strength to fit the tire to the wheel. Bead rubber includes additives to maximize strength and toughness of tyres. Apex The apex is a triangular extruded profile that mates against the bead. The apex provides a cushion between the rigid bead and the flexible inner liner and body ply assembly. Alternatively called \\"filler\\" (as in the diagram above). Belt package Belts are calendered sheets consisting of a layer of rubber, a layer of closely spaced steel cords, and a second layer of rubber. Belts give the tire strength and dent resistance while allowing it to remain flexible. Passenger tires are usually made with two or three belts. Tread The tread is a thick extruded profile that surrounds the tire carcass. Tread compounds include additives to impart wear resistance and traction in addition to environmental resistance. Tread compound development is an exercise in compromise, as hard compounds have long wear characteristics but poor traction whereas soft compounds have good traction but poor wear characteristics. Cushion gum Many higher-performing tires include an extruded component between the belt package and the tread to isolate the tread from mechanical wear from the steel belts. Other components Tire construction methods vary somewhat in the number and type of components, as well as the compound formulations for each component, according to the tire use and price point. Tire makers continuously introduce new materials and construction methods in order to achieve higher performance at lower cost.. Materials * Natural rubber, or polyisoprene is the basic elastomer used in tire making * Styrene-butadiene co-polymer (SBR) is a synthetic rubber that is often substituted in part for natural rubber based on the comparative raw materials cost * Polybutadiene is used in combination with other rubbers because of its low heat-buildup properties * Halobutyl rubber is used for the tubeless inner liner compounds, because of its low air permeability. The halogen atoms provide a bond with the carcass compounds which are mainly natural rubber. Bromobutyl is superior to chlorobutyl, but is more expensive * Carbon black (soot), forms a high percentage of the rubber compound. This gives reinforcement and abrasion resistance * Silica, used together with carbon black in high performance tires, as a low heat build up reinforcement * Sulphur crosslinks the rubber molecules in the vulcanization process * Vulcanizing accelerators are complex organic compounds that speed up the vulcanization * Activators assist the vulcanization. The main one is zinc oxide * Antioxidants and antiozonants prevent sidewall cracking due to the action of sunlight and ozone * Textile fabric reinforces the carcass of the tire Manufacturing process Tire plants are traditionally divided into five departments that perform special operations. These usually act as independent factories within a factory. Large tire makers may set up independent factories on a single site, or cluster the factories locally across a region. =Compounding and mixing= SBR rubber compound to with chemicals formulations # SB Rubber 100 k.g. # carbon 220 150 k.g. # zinc oxide 20.5 k.g. # stearic acid 13.5 k.g. # accelerator 11.2 k.g. # Oil 33.5 k.g. #Al2O3 10.23 kg Compounding is the operation of bringing together all the ingredients required to mix a batch of rubber compound. Each component has a different mix of ingredients according to the properties required for that component. Mixing is the process of applying mechanical work to the ingredients in order to blend them into a homogeneous substance. Internal mixers are often equipped with two counter-rotating rotors in a large housing that shear the rubber charge along with the additives. The mixing is done in three or four stages to incorporate the ingredients in the desired order. The shearing action generates considerable heat, so both rotors and housing are water-cooled to maintain a temperature low enough to assure that vulcanization does not begin. After mixing, the rubber charge is dropped into a chute and fed by an extruding screw into a roller die. Alternatively, the batch can be dropped onto an open rubber mill batchoff system. A mill consists of twin counter- rotating rolls, one serrated, that provide additional mechanical working to the rubber and produce a thick rubber sheet. The sheet is pulled off the rollers in the form of a strip. The strip is cooled, sometimes dusted with a detackifier, and laid down into a pallet bin. The ideal compound at this point would have a highly uniform material dispersion; however in practice there is considerable non-uniformity to the dispersion. This is due to several causes, including hot and cold spots in the mixer housing and rotors, excessive rotor clearance, rotor wear, and poorly circulating flow paths. As a result, there can be a little more carbon black here, and a little less there, along with a few clumps of carbon black elsewhere, that are not well mixed with the rubber or the additives. Mixers are often controlled according to the power integration method, where the current flow to the mixer motor is measured, and the mixing terminated upon reaching a specified total amount of mix energy imparted to the batch. =Component preparation= Components fall into three classes based on manufacturing process: calendering, extrusion, and bead building. The extruder machine consists of a screw and barrel, screw drive, heaters, and a die. The extruder applies two conditions pressure. The extruder screw also provides for additional mixing of the compound through the shearing action of the screw. The compound is pushed through a die, after which the extruded profile is vulcanized in a continuous oven, cooled to terminate the vulcanization process, and either rolled up on a spool or cut to length. Tire treads are often extruded with four components in a quadraplex extruder, one with four screws processing four different compounds, usually a base compound, core compound, tread compound, and wing compound. Extrusion is also used for sidewall profiles and inner liners. The calender is a set of multiple large- diameter rolls that squeeze rubber compound into a thin sheet, usually of the order of 2 metres wide. Fabric calenders produce an upper and lower rubber sheet with a layer of fabric in between. Steel calenders do so with steel cords. Calenders are used to produce body plies and belts. A creel room is a facility that houses hundreds of fabric or wire spools that are fed into the calender. Calenders utilize downstream equipment for shearing and splicing calendered components. =Tire building= Building is the process of assembling all the components onto a tire building drum. Tire-building machines (TBM) can be manually operated or fully automatic. Typical TBM operations include the first-stage operation, where inner liner, body plies, and sidewalls are wrapped around the drum, the beads are placed, and the assembly turned up over the bead. In the second stage operation, the carcass of the tire is inflated, then the belt package and tread are applied. All components require splicing. Inner liner and body plies are spliced with a square-ended overlap. Tread and sidewall are joined with a skived splice, where the joining ends are bevel-cut. Belts are spliced end to end with no overlap. Splices that are too heavy or non-symmetrical will generate defects in force variation, balance, or bulge parameters. Splices that are too light or open can lead to visual defects and in some cases tire failure. The final product of the TBM process is called a green tire, where green refers to the uncured state. Pirelli Tire developed a special process called MIRS that uses robots to position and rotate the building drums under stations that apply the various components, usually via extrusion and strip winding methods. This permits the equipment to build different tire sizes in consecutive operations without the need to change tooling or setups. This process is well suited to small volume production with frequent size changes. The largest tire makers have internally developed automated tire-assembly machines in an effort to create competitive advantages in tire construction precision, high production yield, and reduced labor. Nevertheless, there is a large base of machine builders who produce tire-building machines. =Curing= An opened tire mold being cleaned. The deflated rubber bladder is on the central post. Curing is the process of applying pressure to the green tire in a mold in order to give it its final shape, and applying heat energy to stimulate the chemical reaction between the rubber and other materials. In this process the green tire is automatically transferred onto the lower mold bead seat, a rubber bladder is inserted into the green tire, and the mold closes while the bladder inflates. As the mold closes and is locked the bladder pressure increases so as to make the green tire flow into the mold, taking on the tread pattern and sidewall lettering engraved into the mold. The bladder is filled with a recirculating heat transfer medium, such as steam, hot water, or inert gas. Temperatures are in the area of 350 degrees Fahrenheit with pressures around 350 PSI. Passenger tires cure in approximately 16 minutes. At the end of cure the pressure is bled down, the mold opened, and the tire stripped out of the mold. The tire may be placed on a PCI, or post-cure inflator, that will hold the tire fully inflated while it cools. There are two generic curing press types, mechanical and hydraulic. Mechanical presses hold the mold closed via toggle linkages, while hydraulic presses use hydraulic oil as the prime mover for machine motion, and lock the mold with a breech-lock mechanism. Hydraulic presses have emerged as the most cost-effective because the press structure does not have to withstand the mold-opening pressure and can therefore be relatively lightweight. There are two generic mold types, two-piece molds and segmental molds. Large off-road tires are often cured in ovens with cure times approaching 24 hours. =Final finish= After the tire has been cured, there are several additional operations. Tire uniformity measurement is a test where the tire is automatically mounted on wheel halves, inflated, run against a simulated road surface, and measured for force variation. Tire balance measurement is a test where the tire is automatically placed on wheel halves, rotated at a high speed and measured for imbalance. Large commercial truck/bus tires, as well as some passenger and light truck tires, are inspected by X-ray or magnetic induction based inspection machines, that can penetrate the rubber to analyze the steel cord structure. In the final step, tires are inspected by human eyes for numerous visual defects such as incomplete mold fill, exposed cords, blisters, blemishes, and others.

He worked at the Institut de Recherche Math√©matique (IRMA) in Strasbourg. Biography Meyer was born in 1934 in Boulogne, a suburb of Paris. His family fled from France in 1940 and sailed to Argentina, settling in Buenos Aires, where Paul-Andr√© attended a French school. He returned to Paris in 1946 and entered the Lyc√©e Janson de Sailly, where he first encountered advanced mathematics through his teacher, M Heilbronn.https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Meyer_Paul-Andre/. He entered the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure in 1954 where he studied mathematics. There, he attended lectures on probability by Michel Lo√®ve, a former disciple of Paul L√©vy who had come from Berkeley to spend a year in Paris. These lectures triggered Meyer's interest in the theory of stochastic processes, and he went on to write a thesis on multiplicative and additive functionals of Markov processes, under the supervision of Jacques Deny. Scientific work Meyer is best known for his continuous-time analog of Doob's decomposition of a submartingale, known as the Doob‚ÄìMeyer decomposition and his work on the 'general theory' of stochastic processes, published in his monumental book Probabilities and Potential, written with Claude Dellacherie. Some of his main areas of research in probability theory were the general theory of stochastic processes, Markov processes, stochastic integration, stochastic differential geometry and quantum probability. His most cited book is Probabilities and Potential B, written with Claude Dellacherie. The preceding book is the English translation of the second book in a series of five written by Meyer and Dellacherie from 1975 to 1992 and elaborated from Meyer's pioneering book Probabilit√©s et Potentiel, published in 1966. In the period 1966-1980 Meyer organised the Seminaire de Probabilities in Strasbourg, and he and his co- workers developed what is called the general theory of processes. This theory was concerned with the mathematical foundations of the theory of continuous time stochastic processes, especially Markov processes. Notable achievements of the 'Strasbourg School' were the development of stochastic integrals for semimartingales, and the concept of a predictable (or previsible) process. IRMA created an annual prize in his memory; the first Paul Andr√© Meyer prize was awarded in 2004 .

Spanning approximately along a north‚Äìsouth axis, it supplements the mainline (designated as SR 91) to form the complete turnpike. The extension begins at its southern terminus at U.S. Route 1 (US 1) in Florida City, and transitions into the SR 91 mainline in Miramar at its northern end. Despite their designations as different state roads, the mainline and the extension are continuous in their exit numbering. It was opened in stages between 1973 and 1974, after the mainline of the Turnpike was completed, and is used by both commuters and travelers to the Florida Keys and Everglades National Park. Due to its path, it acts as a de facto outer beltway for Miami, with the Palmetto Expressway (State Road 826) forming an inner beltway. Route description The road begins at its south end at a partial interchange with US 1 in Florida City next to the Florida Keys Outlet Center, where the road heads northeast as a four lane expressway. Travelers to here from the northern parts of the Turnpike Extension can continue south along US 1 to the Florida Keys or the Everglades National Park (via SR 9336). This point also marks the beginning of the HEFT's hidden designation of State Road 821. Between Florida City and Cutler Bay, the HEFT acts as an alternative highway for the communities along US 1. The first 16 miles of the tollway are located within mostly new residential developments that were constructed after Hurricane Andrew, which destroyed most of the area in 1992. Some farms line the rest of this stretch. The first interchange northbound is Campbell Drive / Southwest 312th Street in Homestead, which allows travelers to access the Homestead Hospital and the Homestead-Miami Speedway. The Turnpike then has an exit with Southwest 288th Street at mile 5, providing a connection to the Homestead Air Reserve Base, before leaving Homestead and entering parts of unincorporated Miami-Dade County. At mile 6, the tollway has a southbound exit and northbound entry for Southwest 137th Avenue, with the HEFT heading east- northeast until the exit with SR 989 (Allapattah Road / Southwest 112th Avenue) at mile 9. The road then curves to a northerly direction towards the Homestead Toll Gantry, the first of four on the route, at mile 10. It then enters Cutler Bay, where the highway is also known as the John F. Cosgrove Highway for the next five miles. The first exit in Cutler Bay is with Southwest 216th Street/Cutler Ridge Blvd at mile 11, followed by another at Caribbean Blvd at mile 12. Following exit 11, the turnpike widens to six lanes. The tollway then crosses back over US 1 at the Southland Mall and leaves Cutler Bay. Continuing north, the HEFT serves SR 994 (Quail Roost Drive) at exit 13 and gains another lane in each direction. This is followed by SR 992 (Coral Reef Drive (Southwest 152nd Street)) at exit 16, which marks the northern terminus of the John F. Cosgrove Highway. The tollway passes through older, predominantly residential areas for the next ten miles. Between exits 16 and 17, the Turnpike Extension swells to ten lanes; this section of the tollway also has the highest traffic count at 172,000 vehicles per day (as of 2014). Past exit 17, where SR 874 (Don Shula Expressway) leaves the HEFT to connect to SR 826 (Palmetto Expressway), the tollway drops back to six lanes and soon reaches an interchange with Southwest 120th Street at mile 19. Just north of the Southwest 120th Street exit, still at mile 19, lies the Snapper Creek Service plaza, which is located on the center median with access from both directions and is the only plaza on the extension; unlike the more robust services along the mainline, it only offers a convenience store inside the gas station. The next exit is with SR 94 (Kendall Drive), followed by the Bird Road Toll Gantry at mile 23; from here, the HEFT takes a beeline path north for the next ten miles. The next exit is with SR 976 (Southwest 40th Street), after which the HEFT gains two extra lanes in preparation for the next two exits. After the tollway forms the western end of the Florida International University campus, it meets the Tamiami Trail (US 41) at exit 25, and then SR 836 (Dolphin Expressway) at exit 26 in Fontainebleau, which provides access to Miami International Airport eastbound. North of this interchange, the Turnpike Extension enters a stretch where it forms the border between undeveloped Miami-Dade County to the west and residential developments to the east for the rest of its journey in the county, its width varying between six and eight lanes, with exits at Northwest 12th Street at mile 26, Northwest 41st Street at mile 29, and at Northwest 74th Street at mile 31. Half a mile north of Northwest 74th Street lies the Okeechobee Toll gantry, with the HEFT then intersecting Northwest 106th Street/Beacon Station Boulevard at mile 34. The tollway starts to curve in a north-easterly direction and comes to exit 35 with US 27. Afterwards, the expressway fully enters an undeveloped portion of Miami-Dade County until the next exit at I-75 northbound at exit 39, which is a northbound only exit, with the southbound direction of the Turnpike Extension receiving some traffic from I-75 south. North of the I-75 interchange, the HEFT becomes a four-laned highway again. It crosses the Broward County line, entering the suburban community of Miramar, and then curves eastward. The expressway has an interchange with SR 823 (Red Road) at exit 43, after which the Turnpike Extension is just one block north of the Miami-Dade County line for the remainder of the tollway's length. Residential and commercial developments line both sides of the HEFT through here. The next exit is with SR 817 (University Drive) at exit 46, allowing access to Sun Life Stadium and the Calder Race Course. The Miramar Toll gantry then follows the interchange before the Turnpike Extension ends four miles north of the Golden Glades Interchange at the mainline of Florida's Turnpike. Tolls The HEFT is an all-electronic toll road that only accepts tolls via SunPass transponders or billing by the toll-by-plate at a higher cost. The toll road does not accept cash. The toll gantries are located at the former toll plazas, which closed on February 19, 2011. As of July 1, 2015, the total cost for a two-axled vehicle to drive the whole length of the Turnpike Extension is $4.24 with SunPass and $5.28 via the toll-by-plate system. The HEFT has a toll gantry approximately every . In addition to the mainline toll gantries, most interchanges have individual toll gantries for entering or exiting vehicles; typically, these can be found either on the northbound entry and southbound exit, or the southbound entry and northern exit. Most of these gantries charge $0.53 via SunPass or $0.79 via toll-by-plate per entry or exit, but the Allapattah Road, Northwest 74th Street and Northwest 27th Avenue interchanges charge $0.79 via SunPass or $1.06 via toll-by-plate. Services The Snapper Creek service plaza is the lone service plaza on the HEFT, located at mile 19 in the median of the expressway. It is accessible from both directions. The service plaza is open 24 hours a day, featuring a gas station and a convenience store. History After the Turnpike mainline was completed in 1964, the Turnpike Authority (precursor to Florida's Turnpike Enterprise) explored several extensions to the Turnpike system, including an expressway in western Dade County from Florida City to the Turnpike mainline at the Dade/Broward county line. Construction on the tollway began in July 1971. The northernmost thirteen miles of the tollway between US 27 and the Turnpike mainline was open to traffic on May 1, 1973, at a cost of $22 million and a $0.40 toll to motorists. During the first half of 1974, the expressway between Campbell Drive (SW 312th Street) and US 27 was opened in five stages, with the road running uninterrupted from the Turnpike in Miramar to Homestead on May 20, 1974, with the last section to Florida City connecting to US 1 completed later in 1974. The total toll of the expressway was $0.80. The HEFT has used mile-based exit numbers and an open toll collection system since its opening; both concepts that were implemented on the Turnpike mainline in the late 1980s and early 1990s. On April 27, 1986, the Okeechobee toll plaza opened with a $.25 toll, with the toll plaza at the US 27 exit being removed, and tolls at the Miramar plaza being lowered from $.40 to $.25. On February 2, 1989, tolls on the Expressway doubled from $1.00 to $2.00, with $.50 being charged at each toll plaza. Toll hikes, raising the cost of travelling the expressway from $2 to $3 were supposed to take effect on the Homestead Extension in 1993 to match the rest of the Turnpike, but Hurricane Andrew's impact in the area in 1992 had the state delay toll hikes on the highway until July 9, 1995. In 1997, the Bird Road toll plaza was reconfigured to its current two part form to accommodate the then-bottleneck section of the expressway. The SunPass electronic toll collection system was implemented during 1999, with the toll plazas being reconfigured to allow lanes dedicated to transponder users. A toll hike took effect on March 7, 2004, increasing the toll rate for non SunPass users to $4 for a full length trip, with SunPass users still using the 1995 toll rates. The portion of the HEFT between Exits 11 (Cutler Ridge Boulevard) and 16 (State Road 992) was designated the \\"John F. Cosgrove Highway\\" in 2008 by the Florida Legislature, following his death in 2006. A lawyer and former legislator, Cosgrove was also the first mayor of Cutler Bay, a city along the HEFT. He was instrumental in passing legislation to keep insurers from leaving the state following Hurricane Andrew. On February 19, 2011, the HEFT ceased cash toll collections, becoming an exclusively electronic toll road, a move that was announced in November 2009. The manned toll plazas were converted into all electronic toll gantries, and the only ways to pay are either by SunPass transponders or billing by the toll-by-plate program. In 2007, legislation was passed in Florida to index toll rates across the state to the national Consumer price index (CPI), to be enacted by the end of June, 2012. As a result, the toll rates on the HEFT were raised on June 24, 2012, an increase of 11.7% to reflect the previous five years. In keeping with the legislation, SunPass and toll-by-plate rates were then raised again on July 1, 2013 by 2.1%. Since the indexing of tolls to the national CPI, the entry and exit toll rates have risen by approximately 30 cents, in some cases more than double their pre-2012 rates. Exit list Despite being designated by the Florida Department of Transportation as a separate route (SR 821) from the main portion of Florida's Turnpike (SR 91), the HEFT's exit numbers are regarded to be a continuation of the Turnpike's mainline.

The one on the bottom-left that looks like a child is a \\"shirachigo\\" (ÁôΩÂÖê, \\"white infant\\") that was either the inugami's pupil or the y≈çkai child of a disabled person. Inugami (Áä¨Á•û) from alt= , like kitsunetsuki, is a spiritual possession by the spirit of a dog, widely known about in western Japan. They have seemed firmly rooted until recent years in the eastern ≈åita Prefecture, Shimane Prefecture, and a part of K≈çchi Prefecture in northern Shikoku, and it is also theorized that Shikoku, where no foxes (kitsune) could be found, is the main base of the inugami. Furthermore, traces of belief in inugami exists in the Yamaguchi Prefecture, all of Kyushu, even going past the Satsunan Islands all the way to the Okinawa Prefecture. In the Miyazaki Prefecture, the Kuma District, Kumamoto Prefecture, and Yakushima, the local dialect pronounces it \\"ingami\\" and in Tanegashima, they are called \\"irigami.\\" It can also be written in kanji as ÁãóÁ•û. Origins The phenomenon of inugami spiritual possession was a kojutsu (also called \\"kod≈ç\\" or \\"kodoku\\", a greatly feared ritual for employing the spirits of certain animals) that was already banned in the Heian period that was thought to have spread throughout the population, and it was known to involve cutting off the head of a starving dog and burying the dog at a crossroads to inflame its grudges as people pass over its head so that its spirit would turn into a curse that could be used. Another method was to bury the dog alive leaving only its head sticking out or attach the dog to a supporting pole, put some food in front of the dog, cut the dog's neck just when it is about to starve so that the head would fly towards and bite at the food, burn the dog into mere bones, put the remains into a vessel, and deify it. By doing so, it will spiritually possess that person forever, granting their wishes. Another method was to set several dogs to fight against each other, give the one dog remaining alive some fish, cut off that dog's head, and eat the remaining fish. In Yamaga, Hayami District, ≈åita Prefecture (now Kitsuki), there were actual cases where a miko did cut off a dogs' heads this way, dried the maggots that gathered at the heads, and sold them calling it inugami, and there were also people who were thankful for these and bought them. A depiction of an inugami from Oka Kumaomi's Chiriyahokori However, in descriptions of an inugami's appearance, it is said that they have a somewhat large patch of color around the size of a mouse, and they have split ends on their tail, and as they were a species of talpidae, their eyes cannot be seen, and moved in single file one after another. Thus, they would seem to be more like kuda-gitsune or osaki rather than dogs, so it does not appear as if they were purely following the legends of kod≈ç curses (such as the \\"dog curse\\" found in the In Search of the Supernatural). In fact, it would seem more as if the main focus of these descriptions were imitations of the belief in fox spirits. They also seem similar in appearance to house mouse, and their mouths are said be torn vertically with a pointy end, and in the ≈åita Prefecture, they are said to resemble a dsinezumi shrew, and in Toyooka town, Hayami District, ≈åita, they are said to be a weasel with black and white spots. On the island of Aishima in the aforementioned Yamaguchi Prefecture, they are called \\"inugami nezumi\\" (inugami mice), and like the long-nosed house mouse, they are said to form groups of 75 mice in a single house. On the mountain of Iyayama, Miyoshi District, Tokushima Prefecture, the inugami type are called \\"suikazura,\\" and they are said to be a bit larger than mice and warm themselves by the fireside. In a book titled \\"Chiriyahokori\\" by the kokugaku Oka Kumaomi, it is stated that they have a body length of 1 shaku and 1 sun and looked like bats. Also, in Asai Ry≈çi's Otogi B≈çko, the inugami of Tosa Province was told to have a physical appearance with length similar to that of a rice grain and a body that was colored with patches of black and white, among other colors. There are several theories about how inugami came to be, including the tale that the body of the nue slain by Minamoto no Yorimasa split into 4 parts and scattered and flew to different lands to become inugami,Furthermore in this case, the nue said to be the origin of the dog god (inugami), snake god (hebigami), and monkey god (sarugami) is told to have the head of a monkey, the body of a dog, and the tail of a snake, which is a little different from the usual depiction. as well as the tale that it was born from K≈çb≈ç-Daishi's painting of a dog that was made for the sake of warding off boars. There is also the legend that when Genn≈ç Shinsh≈ç attempted to calm the curse of a sessho-seki by splitting the stone, the fragments that flew off to K≈çzuke Province (now Gunma Prefecture) turned into osaki and the fragments that flew to Shikoku became inugami. Having inugami Inugami are explained to be raised in the storage room chests (tansu), under the floors, and in the water jugs of the families that have inugami. Like other types of spirit possession, inugami become more easily attached to people who are wildly unstable in emotions. Those who get possessed by it (those who get an inugami attached to them) are said to feel pain in their chest, complain about pain in their arms and feet, suddenly sway without warning, and bark like a dog. They would enter and invade the human body from the ears, and it's said that those who get possessed by these would develop a personality full of jealousy. In Tokushima Prefecture, it is said that those that get possessed by an inugami would become voracious big eaters and would have teeth marks on their body when they die. Not limited to just humans, inugami would also possess cows and horses and even inorganic materials, and when they possess a saw, it would become useless. The idea there exist bloodlines of families that easily get possessed by an inugami as well as bloodlines of inugami themselves come from the regional tales told by the bloodlines of the sorcerers, yamabushi, priests, and fuko that engaged in kodoku. In many cases, it shows how those nomadic peoples who engaged in folk sorcery would earn trust and respect and at the same time be treated with discrimination. This is because inugami follows people into their descendants, and it was normal for everyday villagers to consider it taboo to marry into an inugami bloodline, and even associating with them was normally seen with apprehension. In various parts of Shikoku, there is a custom during marriage to check the bloodlines for inugami, and there were none too few cases when it was a problem related to \\"assimilation issues\\" (d≈çwa mondai). In the legends of Komatsu, Sh≈´s≈ç District, Ehime Prefecture (now part of Saij≈ç), there were as many inugami as there were people in families that had inugami, and the number of inugami increased each time the family grew larger. It is said that these inugami would pick up cues and understand what the family is thinking and the inugami would immediately go possess them when the family wanted something. However, it is said that sometimes they didn't behave in an obedient manner and would bite to death members of the family that have inugami. It is said that those afflicted with illnesses that come from inugami were unable to be cured by doctors and needed to have the inugami removed by a sorcerer. In Tanegashima, there is a practice called \\"inugami-tsure\\" (meaning \\"taking along an inugami\\") that was performed when a family that had inugami was known or even just suspected without confirmation to have transferred an inugami to another family whereby the family that originally had inugami would bring food into the other family's house to take the inugami along with them and then go to live in seclusion in a hut in the outskirts of town until the newly afflicted person was cured, and it is said that their descendants would continue even after that to live alone in the mountains. Families that had inugami were thought to have prospered and grew wealthy. At the same time, there were also cases where they were not treated like fox spirits that brought fortune into families by being deified, but rather detested as curse gods. In popular culture * In Season 5, Episode 17 of Grimm, titled \\"Inugami\\", two teenage boys' lives are threatened by a ghost dog Wesen called the Inugami who feels they did not get enough punishment for the accidental death of their friend. * In Yo-kai Watch, the Inugami is a gray and silver fox Yokai who is a recolored version of Kyubi and is called Frostail in the English dub. * In the Inuyasha manga, the title character is a hanyou (half-y≈çkai) born of an Inugami family.

It was made in black-and-white and CinemaScope by 20th Century Fox. The film is based upon the 1948 novel of the same name by Irwin Shaw. Plot German ski instructor Christian Diestl is hopeful that Adolf Hitler will bring new prosperity and social mobility to Germany, so when war breaks out he joins the army, becoming a lieutenant. Dissatisfied with police duty in Paris, he requests to be transferred and is assigned to the North African campaign front. While there, he sees what the war has done to his captain and the captain's wife, and he is sickened by their behavior. Michael Whiteacre and Noah Ackerman befriend each other during their U.S. Army draft physical examination. Michael is in show business and romantically involved with American socialite Margaret Freemantle, who dated ski instructor Christian in 1938 while both were in the Bavarian Alps, where she spent her skiing vacation. Upset by his convictions, she left him on New Year's Eve and returned to Michael. Noah, who is Jewish and employed as a junior department store clerk, attends a party that Michael throws, where he meets Hope Plowman. She falls in love with him, and introduces him to her father, who is unprepared for the idea of having a Jewish son-in-law ‚Äî he has never known a Jew. After talking with Noah, the father approves of him. Noah and Michael enter the Army on the same day, and attend basic training together. Their commanding officer and some of the men in their boot camp platoon bully Noah and demonstrate antagonism toward him. Noah gains their respect by standing up to them, even though he's much smaller and is badly hurt in fistfights with some of them. Military authorities, however, discover Noah's put-upon situation and court-martial the officer. Michael is posted overseas to London. Christian is conflicted, hating what the war has done to his fellow Germans, but unable to escape from his role in the conflict. He despises what his fellow soldiers have done in the name of the Fatherland, but is determined to fulfill his duty to the end. While visiting his seriously wounded captain in a hospital, he is duped into bringing him a bayonet. He later learns from the captain's wife that he committed suicide with it. Thanks to his fame, Michael spends most of the war in a safe job in London, nowhere near the fighting. He finally decides to volunteer for combat after Margaret shames him into action. By pulling strings, he rejoins his old outfit at the front, in Germany, in the final days of the war. He reunites with Noah there. Noah risks his own life during combat by swimming across a canal to save a fellow soldier. The soldier is one of the men who abused him in boot camp. Christian discovers the reality of the Third Reich when he stumbles upon a concentration camp and hears the commander talk about the mass exterminations. Shortly afterwards, the camp is liberated by American forces, which include Michael and Noah. The mayor of a nearby town offers working parties of his constituents to \\"clean up\\" the camp before American reporters and photographers arrive. He is roughly rebuffed by Captain Green after an imprisoned rabbi asks Green for permission to hold a religious service and the mayor protests. Seeing how Noah is affected by the camp, Green instructs him to take a walk and sends Michael with him. Nearby, dazed and tired, Christian screams in rage, breaking apart his machine-pistol on a tree-stump. The noise draws the attention of Michael and Noah, and seeing the German, Michael shoots Christian. They silently watch him die, then quietly walk back to the camp. After the war, a discharged Noah emerges from a subway station. Hope is at a window in their apartment and notices him coming, and lifts up their baby daughter for him to finally see, and he ascends the stairs quickly to embrace his family. Cast Production The film became a box office success and was the key to Martin's comeback in the wake of his split with partner Jerry Lewis. Tony Randall originally had Martin's role, but was replaced after talent agency MCA suggested to director Dmytryk to replace Randall. Clift at first was opposed to Martin, but changed his mind after seeing Randall in Oh, Men! Oh, Women!. Martin, after the failure of his previous movie, accepted $20,000 to star, which was less than he made in a single week of nightclub appearances at the time. The change provoked a mild controversy with rumors circulating that MCA, which represented Brando, Clift, and Martin, had bullied Twentieth-Century Fox, threatening to withhold Brando and Clift. Martin ended up receiving splendid reviews and launched a very successful solo career as an actor. This was the only film that Brando and Clift made together. However, they don't share any scenes together (aside from Martin and Clift standing over the body of Brando's dead character). The picture was produced by Al Lichtman and was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Film. It was also nominated in 1959 for three Academy Awards for Best Cinematography, Best Sound (Carlton W. Faulkner), and Best Music. Release =Critical reception= The Young Lions was well received by film critics. Film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports that 83% of critics gave the film a positive review, with an rating average of 7.6/10. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, most impressed by Brando's performance, gave the film a favorable review, and also praised the film adaptation by Dmytryk.Movie Review: The Young Lions (1958). Variety also gave a positive review, and noted: \\"The Young Lions is a canvas of the Second World War of scope and stature.

Bob Patison serves as the network's president. History MAVTV launched on October 1, 2004 based out of Atlanta with distribution limited to select cable companies, with the name a shortening of Maverick Television (the network's name at launch). The network was privately held and founded by four former executives from Showtime Networks‚ÄîSteve Severn, Steve Smith, Doug Jost, Rob Stevens. It had no connections to the NBA's Dallas Mavericks or Mark Cuban, their owner. =Purchase by Lucas Oil and change of programming direction= In October 2011, longtime partner lubricants company Lucas Oil purchased Maverick Television; the company had provided and sponsored most of the network's motorsports rights even before their purchase, and the network was likely to go dark without the purchase as programming rights had deteriorated towards barter programming and heavy repeats of library content. The network was quickly reformatted away by the new management from a completely male focus featuring lowbrow comedies, low-tier male targeting programming and Canadian content dramas with low cost purchase rights, and late night shows featuring women in bikini shoots towards a general family programming direction. On July 4, 2012, Lucas re-branded the network, shortening the name to MAVTV (now all capitalized), but with the MAV initials standing for \\"Movies, Action, and Variety\\" with the addition of films and more concert programming to the schedule, and a gradual drawdown of racing-related programming to a smaller, yet important part of the schedule to maintain its cable carriage mainly among digital sports tiers, including the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series and the Lucas Oil Pro Pulling League. The network is also advertised on the containers of many Lucas Oil products. Until 2015, the network also aired classic programming such as The Lone Ranger, Starsky & Hutch, and Bonanza, along with films. However, the recovery of the network's revenues under Lucas Oil, along with heavy competition in the classic television rights race from digital over-the-air networks such as MeTV, Antenna TV and movies networks like Movies! and getTV meant that the network began to draw down non-motorsports programming by the start of 2016. The conversion of Fox's Speed to the general-interest Fox Sports 1 also left a plethora of motorsports rights for other networks to pick up, which MAVTV took advantage of. The network also carries motorboat racing and various events from the Federation of International Motorcycling, including ice speedway and motorcycle speedway events. =Past programming= The network's 1080i high definition feed was launched during the fall of 2008. The standard definition version of the network is downscaled from the HD master feed at the cable operator's headend level. Before Lucas Oil took over full management of the network, MAVTV carried programming such as the second season of Rad Girls, SpeedFreaks, Women's Flat Track Roller Derby, American Tailgater, AMA Motorcycle Racing, Wrestlicious TakeDown, Ultimate Combat Experience, Bikini AllStars and Best of the Best. In addition, MAVTV presented the male-specific documentary series Manumentaries. Except for existing Lucas Oil programming and the AMA, none of this programming currently remains on the network's schedule. Overnights had been filled by music video/interactive SMS programming from NOYZ via a time brokerage agreement before that company went bankrupt in early 2008. =Sports deals= MAVTV Satellite Broadcasting Van at 2018 ARCA race In 2007, MAVTV struck a deal with the Women's Flat Track Derby Association to broadcast two of the three roller derby finals: the Eastern Regional Tournament (Heartland Havoc, which was broadcast as a series of one- hour weekly episodes) and the National Championships (Texas Shootout). MAVTV contracted with the Automobile Racing Club of America, the auto racing sanctioning body, to air at least 6 races in 2008, including both 100-mile dirt races at the Illinois State Fairgrounds in Springfield, and the Southern Illinois State Fairgrounds in DuQuoin. SpeedFreaks hosts Kenny Sargent and Crash Gladys also appeared on episodes of the Lucas Motorsports hour. MAVTV sponsored the MAVTV 500, the final race in the 2012 season of the IndyCar Series, which took place at the Auto Club Speedway in Fontana, California. MAVTV is partnered with King of the Cage, broadcasting their live and past Martial Arts events, as well as Championship Wrestling From Hollywood. MAVTV did their 1st live motorsports event, the Lucas Oil Challenge Cup featuring the Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series on October 27, 2013 from Lake Elsinore Motorsports Park. They will also do live coverage of the Lucas Oil Chili Bowl Nationals, one of the biggest midget car races every year. The East Bay Winter Nationals from the Lucas Oil Late Model Dirt Series and all Moto1 rounds of the Lucas Oil AMA Pro Motorcross championship in 2014. They will also cover several King of the Cage MMA events live in 2014. In 2014, MAVTV partnered with professional road racing series Pirelli World Challenge to air the Pirelli World Challenge Touring Car Championship. In 2017, MAVTV signed a multi year deal with ARCA Racing to bring almost all their races live or broadcast at later time/date. Outside the races broadcast from Fox Sports. In 2018, Signed a deal to show highlights of Tony Stewart All Star Circuit of Champions Also MAVTV expanded it coverage of ARCA Racing with 11 of its 12 races broadcasting live In 2019, MAVTV is showing all of its ARCA races its broadcast live for the first time =Movie deals= On April 27, 2010, MAVTV signed a deal with Sony Pictures giving them access to select titles from Sony's film library. The deal was part of MAVTV's programming strategy to expand its schedule and abandon their former all-male programming direction. The network added films from the Warner Bros. library in July 2012. These deals eventually expired though as mentioned above, and MAVTV eventually went to an all-motorsports schedule by the start of 2016. Personnel Key people at MAVTV include: * Bob Patison, President of MAVTV and Executive Vice President and General Counsel of Lucas Oil * Dan Teitscheid, Senior Vice President of Content Distribution & Partner Marketing * Ed Niemi, Senior Vice President of Distribution * Jason Patison, Director of Programming Carriage MAVTV can be found in the US on Cablevision, Spectrum, GCI in Alaska, select cable systems within the Caribbean Co-op, Xfinity, RCN Corporation, AT&T; U-verse and DirecTV. As per an email sent to its subscribers, Verizon FiOS removed the channel from its TV service along with Youtoo TV, Blue Highways TV, and Black Belt TV as of December 31, 2012, making it available as an \\"On Demand\\" service. However, the channel returned to Verizon FiOS on June 10, 2014. DirecTV added MAVTV on June 10, 2013. The channel is carried in standard definition and high definition. MAVTV Canada was launched in January, 2017 in a partnership with the Neon Star Sports & Entertainment Inc, which produces Canadian content. Dish Network previously carried MAVTV in high definition from May 8, 2009 to May 12, 2015. Dish dropped the channel as MAVTV and its parent company Lucas Oil failed to reach a new agreement to continue carrying the channel. FuboTV was added in March 2018 with Sportsman Channel, Outdoor Channel, World Fishing Network, Outside TV and til late October motorsports.tv to the Adventure Plus Package.

The installation was organized by the Warsaw Centre for Contemporary Art (13 December 2002 ‚Äì 13 December 2003). Since then, the palm tree has become a permanent fixture of Warsaw, as it was not removed at the end of the official exhibition but instead came under the protection of the President of Warsaw. It went neglected and leafless two years later, until the artist and friends mounted its restoration. It still stands in the center of the city. In the summer of 2007, the palm underwent a complete makeover, becoming more weatherproof and easier to maintain (unlike natural palms, its fronds require periodic manual replacement).

She also completed the Studio Semester Program at the State University of New York, U.S. (1994‚Äì1995). Work Rajkowska describes the sense of her activity as building relationships with other people. She often only sets up the context of a meeting, allowing it to be an open experience. She usually engages a number of people as participants, and she also uses herself in her work. For example, in Satisfaction Guaranteed, her body was being symbolically consumed by other people .

It is an attempt to infuse with Israel's scenery Warsaw's Jerusalem Avenue ‚Äì a street whose name and history, in return, sends the observer back to Israel. In another way, the palm tree refers to a popular idiomatic expression in the Polish language ( ‚Äì literally: \\"the palm tree sprouts/bounces back\\") that indicates something unthinkable, outside common understanding, escaping the usual way of reasoning, simply ‚Äì something idiotic. On the other hand, through the very presence of the palm tree in the middle of Warsaw's centre, it may signify that the commonly accepted way of reasoning does not fit the real world.

Their work is linked to the Soc Art movement, also known as conceptualism, the second socialist realism or New Red Art. The two were highly influence by Oskar Hansen, who taught them in Warsaw, and his focus on documentation and production process of works. They often exhibited their work in their own apartment. Their pieces appropriated symbols and imagery of the communist Polish regime at the time. Following changes to the Polish regime in 1989, Kulik began to work independently, using photographic collage and focusing on self-portraiture.

It was a protest against the belief that body illnesses or senility doom its owner to social invisibility. Included in the work are a photographic triptych of Olympia and a video of Kozyra's treatment. The first image shows Kozyra lying in the same pose as Manet's \\"Olympia\\", but her body is not meant to be the object of desire as with Manet's work, but, instead is pale, hairless, and unhealthy. The second image depicts Kozyra naked on a hospital bed‚Äì she is completely hairless and the effects of the chemotherapy are obvious. The third image shows an old woman sitting on a bed ‚Äì she is alone. Her body is flabby and she has really saggy breasts. Her face is wrinkled all over and it seems that all her teeth are gone. At the same time she looks really calm ‚Äì like she would reconcile with her fate. The women in all the photographs have one thing in common ‚Äì black ribbon wrapped around the neck to symbolizes mourning and to hearken back to the work by Manet. The most scandalous element is not presenting the female nude as itself, but presenting the reality of life, illness, and death; that the female body is not just a thing of beauty and admiration of the male gaze. Cheerleaderka/Cheerleader by Katarzyna Kozyra from the permanent collection of Zachƒôta National Gallery of Art (Warsaw, Poland) \\"Bathhouse\\" (1997) considers similar subject matter. Kozyra‚Äôs intention was to show how women really appear in situation where nobody is looking and when they don‚Äôt need to follow beauty canons. Kozyra was able to document this natural behavior by shooting her work with a hidden video camera. By doing this, she presented the female body as is and encouraged the viewers to go against their previous ideals and standards of beauty. Additionally, it was an allusion to the history of art, with works of Rembrandt and Jean Ingres opening and closing the video. \\"Man‚Äôs Bathhouse\\" (1999) was a confrontation with and continuation of \\"Bathhouse\\". Kozyra went into a men‚Äôs bathhouse with fake penis attached to her and a towel hung on her shoulders covering the breasts. Surprisingly she found out, that men even when being alone they still focus on their appearance, peer at each other, and compare. \\"The Rite of Spring\\" (1999-2002) was a video installation inspired by the choreography for Igor Stravinsky's 1913 ballet of the same name. Kozyra used former dancers from the Polish National Ballet who were no longer able to dance for this work. Kozyra photographed the elderly subjects lying on the ground in dance positions and then animated their movements. Kozrya has been working on her \\"In Art Dreams Become True\\" series since 2003. The series of visual art, music, and performance is released in phases of the project, each as a separate work although they are intended to be combined in a feature film. In the work, Kozrya is \\"being manipulated as she strives to fulfill her dream of becoming a \\"real woman\\" and an opera singer.\\" In 2011, she received the Award of the Minister of Culture and National Heritage of the Republic of Poland for her artistic accomplishments. Controversy Anda Rottenberg, Director of the Zachƒôta National Gallery of Art in Warsaw where Kozyra first showed \\"Bath house\\" in 1997 and who also purchased the work, sparked off controversy by writing to Art Monthly in October 1998 and claiming that Kozyra's \\"Bath house\\" and artist Tacita Dean's 1998 \\"Gellert\\" were of the same subject: the most famous bathhouse in Budapest. Freely admitting that controversy helps in the promotion of a work, \\"Controversy around this work was in fact a very stimulating factor and now as the months passed Bath house has come to be regarded as classic\\", Rottenberg found the coincidence \\"indeed amazing\\". However, the works differ completely. Whereas Kozyra used hidden cameras intending to reveal the bathing women's natural behaviour as well as challenging normal considerations of privacy, and is a multi-screen video work (see letter again), Dean had permission from the bath workers and her single screen film is concerned with the healing sulphurous waters of the baths (see Colin Gleadell, The Daily Telegraph, 1 February 2001).

Her memorial in Platte County, Missouri honors all four rivers that share the name recorded by Lewis and Clark in 1803. Construction and commissioning Platte was built by the Bethlehem Steel Company, Baltimore, Maryland; launched 8 July 1939; sponsored by Mrs. Harold R. Stark; and commissioned at Norfolk, Virginia 1 December 1939, Commander P. L. Meadows in command. Service history After fitting out in the Philadelphia Navy Yard Platte departed Norfolk 27 March 1940, making two voyages to the oil docks of Houston, Texas, then supported the fleet operating from the Panama Canal Zone. During the next forty-five days she replenished fleet tugs and who towed the huge floating drydock to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Platte reached her new base of San Pedro, California 4 September. For the next fourteen months she carried liquid cargo, passengers and freight to Pearl Harbor. Her last voyage to Hawaii prior to outbreak of war terminated at San Diego, California 26 November 1941 and she was in that port when the Japanese struck Pearl Harbor. =World War II= On 17 December, Platte put to sea with a convoy for Pearl Harbor and was underway on 11 January 1942 in company with the aircraft carrier , flagship of Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr., commander of Task Force 8. She provided underway replenishment services for this carrier task force as it guarded troop and cargo ships reinforcing the Samoan Islands. Platte spent the next months refueling task forces on offensive patrol in the Coral Sea. She fueled the Australian squadron along with the carrier task force and the carrier task force prior to the carrier strikes on Salamaua and Lae, New Guinea. She then stood out to sea with Enterprise on 28 May as all fleet units prepared to turn back the expected Japanese attack on Midway Island, fueling the Enterprise task force and the Yorktown task force just before the Battle of Midway. Platte then began her support of Solomon Islands operations. She was in the ocean approaches to the Solomons on the morning of 10 August, delivering fuel to the Enterprise carrier task group, then the carrier group two days later. Platte returned to Noumea on 14 August to replenish her tanks, then subsequently fueled Saratoga , and Enterprise carrier task groups. After a return to the West Coast, she operated in support of fleet units engaged in the Guadalcanal Campaign. Platte departed San Pedro on 9 April 1943 to provide logistic support for the Aleutian Islands Campaign, serving as station tanker in Kulak Bay, Adak. After several runs between the West Coast and Pearl Harbor, Platte served with twelve other fleet oilers of Service Squadron 8 as part of a task group refueling warships involved in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign. Platte was underway for the Marshall Islands the afternoon of 31 January 1944, fueling the battleship and six destroyers, before standing out to sea on 11 February. On 6 June, Platte cleared Majuro Atoll with Fast Carrier Task Forces for the Marianas Islands, and on 14 June fueled the carrier task group while in sight of Tinian Island. She completed her last fueling and third replenishment cruise for logistic support of the Marianas Operation on 14 August. Platte loaded fuel and cargo at Eniwetok, then made passage to Seeadler Harbor, Manus, Admiralty Islands. This harbor was her base of logistic operations in support of the occupation of certain Palau Islands; Ulithi, in the Caroline Islands; and Leyte and Samar in the Philippines. She cleared that base on 4 September and was off Palau to fuel numerous ships. Platte was underway from Manus on 20 October with five other oilers and escorts to support the liberation of the Philippines. After overhaul in the United States, Platte provided logistic support to combat ships in the forward area to the northeast of the Marianas Islands where she fueled carriers, cruisers, battleships and destroyers engaged in the Battle of Iwo Jima and the carrier strikes on Tokyo. Platte stood out to sea on 13 March to commence support of Fast Carrier Task Forces in the conquest of Okinawa. She terminated her support of the Battle of Okinawa upon her arrival at Ulithi on 14 June and departed that port 3 July as part of the logistic support force of Fast Carrier Task Force 38 for the strikes against Honsh≈´, Japan. On 15 August word was received that President Harry S. Truman had announced the agreement of Japan to surrender. Platte entered Tokyo Bay on 10 September to act as station tanker in that port until 29 September when she got underway for return to the United States. =Post-War= She arrived at Yokohama, Japan, to support the occupation forces 4 February 1946. During the next twelve months she constantly shuttled from the oil docks of Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, to support fleet operations at principal ports of Japan, Korea, and the Philippine Islands. In the following months she gave logistic support to the fleet at ports of Japan; Buckner Bay, Okinawa; and Tsingtao, China. Fleet tactics off the coast of Southern California and upkeep in the Long Beach Naval Shipyard and Mare Island Navy Yards were followed by another cruise to the Far East. =Korea= On 22 February 1951 Platte left the Hawaiian Islands astern and set her course by way of the Marshall Islands and Okinawa for Sasebo, Japan. She reached the last named port 2 April and was off Songjin, Korea, 4 April to deliver fuel to the cruiser and five destroyers of the United Nations Escort and Blockade Force on the east coast of Korea. This was the first of an endless chain of logistic support runs from Sasebo to the coast of Korea where she also gave vital fuel and aviation gasoline to the fast attack carriers , , and . Platte entered the harbor of Keelung, Formosa, 17 May to serve as station tanker for the ships on Formosa Patrol. She resumed replenishment of the fleet off Korea from Sasebo 30 June. Platte commenced a second tour of service in support of the warships on Formosa Patrol and those operating in combat areas off the coast of Korea 3 January 1952. She reached Sasebo 3 May 1953 for a third tour of duty in support of the United Nations Forces in Korea. She continued operations in the East China Sea and off Inchon after the truce agreement and put to sea from Yokosuka 24 October for return to Long Beach, California 10 November. Platte stood out of San Diego Harbor 17 March 1954 and touched at Yokosuka on her way to Subic Bay in the Philippine Islands, thence to Formosa and Hong Kong before arrival at Sasebo. She returned to Long Beach 2 October and had completed six similar tours in support of US 7th Fleet operations in the Far East by 28 June 1960. A unit of Service Squadron 3 on each of these tours in the Far East, her operations in support of the 7th Fleet carried her to every principal port of Japan, the Philippines, Okinawa, Formosa and Korea. Her operations on the West Coast which intervened this service were under Service Squadron 1. =Vietnam= Platte made almost yearly deployments to the western Pacific Ocean from 1960 to 1968, including extensive operations in Vietnamese waters and refueling the task group off Korea during the Pueblo incident as part of Operation Formation Star. Platte served with the Pacific Fleet into 1970. She was sold for scrapping on 14 May 1971. Platte received 11 battle stars for World War II service, 6 battle stars for Korean War service, and 8 campaign stars for Vietnam War service.

After a 35-year absence from music, in 2002 Mayer began recording and touring again, releasing albums with Fat Possum, Alive Records and Norton Records. Career Mayer started his career at Fortune Records, a Detroit record label owned by Jack and Devora Brown. There he became label-mates with fellow Fortune stars Nolan Strong and Andre Williams. Mayer would stay with the label for six years, recording a handful of records. When Mayer was 18 years old he scored a Top 40 hit record in 1962 with \\"Village of Love,\\" credited to Nathaniel Mayer and The Fabulous Twilights. It was originally released on Fortune Records, who then leased the record to United Artists Records for wider distribution. Follow-ups such as \\"Leave Me Alone\\" (1962) and \\"I Had A Dream\\" (1963) failed to duplicate the success of \\"Village of Love\\" (although both records, especially \\"Leave Me Alone,\\" sold well regionally). In 1966, Mayer released \\"I Want Love and Affection (Not The House Of Correction),\\" a funky offering in the James Brown vein. He then split with Fortune Records due to differences. Post Fortune Records After Mayer‚Äôs Fortune Records days, his whereabouts were practically unknown and only ever confirmed by rumors for several decades. Though he did surface in 1980 to record the \\"Raise the Curtain High\\" single. It would be the only release from Mayer between 1966 and 2002. Disappearing into the ghettos of East Detroit for the next two decades, rumors abounded. However, after Norton Records released \\"I Don't Want No Bald-Headed Woman Telling Me What to Do\\" in 2002 (a never before released recording from 1968), Mayer was inspired to record and perform again. Mayer staged a full-fledged musical comeback in 2002. His once-sweet soul scream had deepened to a rasping growl, giving his latter albums a whole new feel. He played clubs and festivals, gaining a new generation of fans with his exciting live shows. In 2004, Mayer returned to the studio to record I Just Want to Be Held for Fat Possum Records, a Mississippi label known mostly for releasing records by obscure bluesmen. In 2005, he toured with fellow Fat Possum artist The Black Keys. In 2006, the Dutch-based Stardumb Records released a 7\\" single featuring three songs taken from the Fat Possum album. Mayer's last sessions were released across two albums, 2007's Why Don't You Give It To Me? and 2009's Why Won't You Let Me Black?, both on Alive Records and featuring Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys, Matthew Smith of Outrageous Cherry, Troy Gregory of The Dirtbombs, and Dave Shettler of SSM and The Sights. Why Don't You Give It To Me? was Julian Cope's Album of the Month on his Head Heritage site in May 2008. The Detroit Cobras remade \\"Village of Love\\" in 1996. While \\"Leave Me Alone\\" was covered by The Hard Feelings in 2001. Eve Monsees, The Exiles and the Gibson Brothers have all recorded \\"I Had A Dream.\\" In 2014, Nathaniel Mayer was inducted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame. Death Within a year after completing his first European tour, Mayer suffered multiple strokes. After months of hospitalization, Nathaniel Mayer died on November 1, 2008 in Detroit, Michigan.

He is a third generation Zainichi Korean and a notable representative of Zainichi Korean music in Japan. M-Flo's hits in the early 2000s, such as \\"How You Like Me Now?\\" and \\"Come Again\\" led to Verbal rapping and producing a wide range of acts in Japan such as Crystal Kay, BoA, Kumi Koda and Namie Amuro. Verbal considers his role in m-flo as a \\"host\\" than a rapper or producer, though their success and critical acclaim established them as an iconic and influential hip hop production team throughout Asia Verbal in Bangkok, Thailand, 2006. Verbal is also a member of other hip hop groups such as Mic Banditz and Teriyaki Boyz and has worked with Kanye West, Pharrell and Kylie Minogue amongst many others. Verbal is also the chairman of music label Espionage Records (an imprint of Rhythm Zone under Avex Group), production agency Kozm and has a fashion brand called Ambush, co-founded with his wife Yoon. He launched his solo career in March 2011 with the album \\"Visionair\\". Biography Verbal was born in Tokyo with Korean background in 1975. In 1985, his parents moved to Boston in the United States for work. When at a YMCA summer camp, Verbal was first exposed to hip hop music, in the form of Run‚ÄìD.M.C.'s \\"It's Tricky\\" when the other children sung the song on the bus for the camp. He was impressed and influenced by the hip hop culture of New York City and at 14 years old he started writing lyrics in English. His parents moved back to Tokyo and Verbal attended St. Mary's International School. He met Taku Takahashi there and the pair formed a rap rock band called N.M.D. in 1992. The band received many offers from major record labels after their live performances, however as Verbal did not see being a rapper as a practical career, he turned down these offers. Verbal returned to the United States, to study philosophy and marketing at Boston College. In his first year of university, he abandoned these plans after a great romantic disappointment, converting to Protestantism and deciding to study for a masters in divinity at Gordon‚ÄìConwell Theological Seminary to become a pastor. Verbal has said that his influences began with gangster rap groups like N.W.A. After he mistakenly purchased a Gang Starr album, he became interested in East coast hip hop including De La Soul and Pete Rock & CL Smooth. =M-Flo= In 1998, Verbal returned for winter break to Japan. During this time, he recorded a rap for a cover of Barbra Streisand's \\"The Way We Were\\" that Takahashi was producing. Masaji Asakawa from the DJ group GTS, a contact of Takahashi's, believed the song was very high quality. M-Flo was then officially formed, with Verbal and Takahashi recording many songs together. Asakawa believed one of these songs, \\"Been So Long,\\" featuring vocals from a mutual friend of both Verbal and Takahashi, Lisa, was high enough quality for him to try to convince Verbal to become a full-time musician. He was convinced and the group debuted as a three-person group (with vocalist Lisa) in 1999 with \\"The Tripod E.P.,\\" which debuted in the top 10 on the Japanese singles chart. The group achieved great success in 2000 and 2001 with the songs \\"How You Like Me Now?\\" and \\"Come Again,\\" with the former selling more than 220,000 copies and the latter approximately 390,000 copies. The band's second album, Expo Expo, debuted at #4 on the charts. During the group's first two albums, Verbal was travelling back and forth between Japan and America to finish his studies. During these initial years, Verbal had collaborated with a great number of Japanese artists already, including producing the female rap unit Heartsdales. In 2002, Lisa left M-Flo following a disagreement to pursue a solo career. During this time, Verbal and Takahashi's solo works intensified, with Verbal taking a major part in two different hip hop supergroups, Mic Banditz and Suite Chic. In 2003, M-Flo returned from hiatus, but instead of using a new full-time vocalist, the band featured a different famous musician on each of their songs. =Mic Banditz= In 2002, Verbal formed the Japanese hip hop supergroup Mic Banditz on his Espionage Records label imprint. The group comprised rappers Verbal, Arkitec, 51-Goichi-, Coyass, and Clench and Mr. Blistah of the duo Clench & Blistah. The group represented a more traditional hip-hop sound in contrast to M-Flo's pop-influenced sound. They released two full-length albums of majority Japanese-language rap, 2003's Sixth Sense and 2004's Johnny Astro & the Diamond Crooks and collaborated with Japanese R&B; singer Emi Hinouchi, who was at the time signed to fellow M-Flo member Taku Takahashi's Tachytelic Records imprint. The group have been on hiatus since 2005.:ja:MIC BANDITZ =Teriyaki Boyz= In 2005, Verbal became a member of another hip hop supergroup, Teriyaki Boyz. The group has collaborated with many famous Western hip hop musicians, such as The Neptunes, the Beastie Boys, Kanye West and Pharrell Williams. The group came to the most prominence in the West with the eponymous theme song for the film The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift in 2006. In 2007, M-Flo released their final album featuring different vocalists, Cosmicolor. After this point, the group have released sporadically, with a succession of different compilation albums. Verbal has consistently been working with other artists since then, producing songs for such artists as BoA and Halcali. Some of his biggest collaborations since then have been a cover of Godiego's song \\"The Galaxy Express 999\\" with Exile, which has been certified as double platinum for cellphone downloads by the RIAJ and a collaboration with Kana Nishino, \\"Kimi no Koe o,\\" which has been certified gold for cellphone downloads. In 2010, Verbal directed his first music video, Minmi's \\"Pa to Hanasaku,\\" which also features Verbal. =Solo activities= In September 2004, Verbal married his college sweetheart, Korean American Yoon. Together they started jewelry label Ambush, with the initial aim of custom- making jewelry for Verbal. They have since produced several lines of jewelry, collaborating with brands including A Bathing Ape and selling custom pieces to celebrities including Teriyaki Boyz collaborator Kanye West. On March 16, 2011, Verbal released his debut solo album Visionair, though the March 11 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami overshadowed the release, causing cancellation of its promotion. Verbal appeared as the opening act for the tour of Kylie Minogue to Japan in April and the two recorded a charity song titled \\"We Are One\\" to raise awareness and encourage donations to unicef. Visionair featured collaborations with international acts Nicki Minaj, Jermaine Dupri, Swizz Beatz and Lil' Wayne, as well as Japan's Namie Amuro. The first single from the album, \\"Fall Out feat. Shunya,\\" is the opening theme song for the drama Perfect Report and was released digitally in December. May 2011 saw Verbal take Visionair out on the road with the \\"Angree Yung Robotz\\" tour alongside electro DJ Mademoiselle Yulia.

Finance  Dallen's investing was chronicled by the Financial Times in a 2014 article, saying \\"... the basket of defaulted Argentina bonds, bought by Dallen for clients last year when they were trading for 30 something cents on the dollar, rose through the mid 80s to reach a bid price of 90 cents on the dollar.\\" Dallen ultimately sold them at 150, quintupling his clients' and firm's investments.http://southfloridabondtraders.org/fullpanel/uploads/files/2016-sfbta- conference-program.pdf Dallen predicted that Argentina would default again, that the country would not settle with the holdout bondholders when the Rights Upon Future Offers (RUFO) clause expired, and that President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner and her party would be defeated in the 2015 Presidential elections. In Brazil, Dallen warned about various companies that were set to tumble and lose investors' money beginning in 2013, specifically Petrobras and Eike Batista's OGX/OSX complex. In Colombia, Dallen warned about the upcoming collapse of investor favorite Pacific Rubiales in 2013 because the company‚Äîwhich would default and declare bankruptcy in 2016‚Äîwas \\"branching out into other areas that are away from their core competencies....\\" In Venezuela, Dallen began pointing out shortages - including being the first to point out most famously the toilet paper shortage‚Äîin January 2013 when oil was above $100 a barrel and warning of the economic collapse that would come. At the same time, Dallen was able to double investments of his firm and clients in Harvest Natural Resources (NYSE: HNR) in one month before taking profits and earn a 60% return in 6 months in Venezuelan Koch brothers entity Fertinitro. In January 2015, Dallen began warning investors in U.S. based Citgo when the Venezuelan government-owned company issued $2.8 billion in new debt, not for its own corporate purposes but to send back to cash-strapped Venezuela. Canadian miner Crystallex, which won a $1.4 billion judgment against Venezuela for the expropriation of the company's mining investments in an arbitration before the World Bank's International Center for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), would subsequently sue Citgo and PDVSA under the Delaware Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act to recover the money. Dallen predicted in March 2016 that the Venezuela opposition strategy to achieve a Recall Referendum on the presidency of Nicolas Maduro by the end of 2016 would be frustrated by the governing regime, warning the Financial Times that \\"The chavistas have no place to go and they will hold on for as long as possible.\\" In early 2016, Dallen began warning that Venezuela would default on its billions in foreign debt, telling Reuters that \\"It is a question of when, not if,\\" and noting that \\"The only thing that could change that is a sharp recovery in oil prices, and/or a bailout from Venezuela's friends in China, Russia or Iran.\\" Keying on cashflows from China and Russia, Dallen would help discover and publicize that Venezuela's state-owned oil company PDVSA was so short of cash that they had mortgaged 49.9% of their U.S. oil refinery Citgo to Russia's state-owned oil company Rosneft and he would later be called upon to Testify about Russia's actions before Congress. Likewise, Dallen was also able to document the breakdown in good relations between China and Venezuela by discovering an international arbitration and lawsuit brought by Sinopec against PDVSA for non-payment. By August of 2016, Dallen's cashflow models were able to accurately predict the timing of the default and CNN, in an article titled with his prediction, quoted Dallen saying that Venezuela would run out of cash \\"within a year.\\" The Financial Times in an article titled \\"Venezuela stopped bond payments in September\\" credited Dallen for the discovery and proof. Bloomberg noted that Dallen and his investors were able to profit from his default prediction by purchasing Credit Default Swaps (CDS) -- insurance against default -- for a 300% return when Venezuela and PDVSA were declared in default in November by the International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA).https://www.investors.com/wp- content/uploads/2017/11/IBD110717INTEREST.pdf  Awards  Dallen's Masters thesis \\"An Overview of European Community Protection of Human Rights, with some Special References to the U.K.,\\" written while at Oxford, was named \\"Article of the Year\\" by the Common Market Law Review and published in book and journal form by them. Dallen was awarded the $40,000 Harry S. Truman Scholarship by the administration of President Ronald Reagan, making Dallen the first Truman Scholar from Ole Miss. Dallen served on the Board of Directors of the Truman Scholars Association from 2012 through 2014. Dallen was named a Harold Wallace Rosenthal Fellow for the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations. Dallen would later be called upon to testify before the Committee on Foreign Relations on Venezuela.http://esdata.info/pdf/TESTIMONY_Russ_Dallen_US_Senate_Committee_on_Foreign_Relations_Political_and_Economic_Crisis_in_Venezuela_17_March_2015.pdf Dallen now serves on the Rosenthal Fellowship Advisory Board.

Biography =Early career= Born to a samurai family in the Satsuma domain (present day Kagoshima prefecture), Kataoka entered the 3rd class of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy in 1871, and served as a midshipman on the corvette . Kataoka, accompanied Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu as an exchange student to Germany. He became fluent in German, French and English during his 18 months abroad and graduated with the top honors in his class. He later trained with future Admiral Yamamoto Gonnohy≈çe on board the German ships Vineta and Leipzig from 1877-1878. Serving as a lieutenant in various fleet posts from 1881‚Äì1886, his first command was that of the corvette Tenry≈´ on 20 June 1882. Kataoka also served as an instructor for two years at the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy before returning to Germany in 1889 for advanced studies. Following the completion of his studies, Kataoka was assigned to Berlin, Germany as a naval attach√©, with his primary duties as providing assistance to Prince Higashifushimi Yorihito and Prince Yamashina Kikumaro during their travels in Europe. He was recalled to Japan at the start of the First Sino-Japanese War in 1894. =First Sino-Japanese War= Appointed to the Imperial Japanese Navy General Staff during the early months of the war, Kataoka was soon placed in combat command of the corvette and later of the cruiser during the Pescadores expedition and conquest of Taiwan between late 1894 and early 1895. Following the war, Kataoka served on a number of various fleet and shore posts and was promoted to rear admiral in 1899, and later vice admiral in 1903. He turned down a posting as Resident-General of Korea and also turned down a posting as Governor-General of Taiwan, stating that as a navy man, he did not have the ability to handle territorial issues. In reality, he had no interest in politics at all. =Russo-Japanese War= During the opening months of the Russo-Japanese War, Kataoka was placed in command of the 3rd Fleet, a collection of antiquated ships nicknamed the \\"Funny Fleet\\". Despite the motley assortment of obsolete ships, Kataoka won distinction commanding the fifth and sixth battle divisions from the cruiser during the Battle of the Yellow Sea and later from the cruiser during the Battle of Tsushima. He also led the naval expedition to seize Sakhalin prior to the conclusion of the Treaty of Portsmouth. A year after the war, Kataoka became chief of the Navy Ministry's Department of Ships. In 1907, Kataoka was elevated to the title of danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system, and was promoted to full admiral and made commander-in-chief of the 1st Fleet in 1910, before being placed on the reserve list the following year. Kataoka lived in retirement until his death in 1920. His grave is at the Tama Cemetery in Tokyo.

Early career Born in London, England on 1 July 1958, Wiggins began his racing career while at school as a kart driver in 1973. He was selected as a member of the British International Kart Team for 1975‚Äì76. He trained as a design engineer for specialist road car conversions and later joined Ron Dennis' Project Four Racing in 1977 for Formula 2, and then as an engineer in British Formula 3 in 1988. In 1979 Wiggins continued his driving career in British Formula Ford, finishing 2nd in the Championship. The following year (1980) he focused on his management and engineering skills, joining Rushen Green Racing for British F3. In 1982 he was appointed team manager and chief engineer with Van Diemen in British and European Formula 2000. During this period, he also constructed a development Formula Ford chassis designed by David Baldwin which became the next generation Van Diemen Formula 2000 chassis. Pacific Racing Wiggins established Pacific Racing in 1984 as owner, chairman, and chief engineer. The team went on to unrivelled success over the following 13 years. Pacific won every European single-seater championship on its way up to Formula One and is the only team ever to climb from the lowest ranks to compete at the premier level, with luminaries such as JJ Lehto, David Coulthard, Eddie Irvine and Christian Fittipaldi behind the wheel of his cars, he moved the operation to Formula One in . Pacific Racing Achievements: *1984 1st European & Benelux Formula Ford 1600 Championships *1985 1st British Formula Ford 1600 Championship *1986 1st British & World Formula Ford 2000 Championships *1987 1st British, European, & World Formula Ford 2000 Championships *1988 1st British Formula 3 Championship *1991 1st FIA Formula 3000 Championship *1993 2nd FIA European Formula 3000 *1994‚Äì1995 FIA Formula One World Championship The team Pacific Grand Prix ran on a shoestring budget for two seasons, designing, building and racing their own chassis, with highest finishing positions of 7th in Brazil 1994 and 7th in Australia 1995. The inaugural year they ran struggling Ilmor engines and battled with Simtek at the rear of the grid. Just making the grid was a challenge; while Bertrand Gachot qualified for five of the first seven events, Paul Belmondo made it just twice. They qualified and ran every race in 1995 with Gachot and Andrea Montermini, Jean-Denis D√©l√©traz, and Giovanni Lavaggi, but Wiggins returned to F3000 in 1996, plus competed at LeMans with a BRM-Nissan and then closed Pacific in 1997. Lola In 1998, following MasterCard Lola's ill-fated decision to enter Formula One, Wiggins helped to get the newly purchased Lola out of receivership and back on its feet, then serving as Vice-President and then President of Lola Cars International Inc. in America and Sales and Marketing Director of Lola Cars International in the UK. Indycar Wiggins left Lola in 2000 and took over as president and team owner of Tony Bettenhausen Jr's CART team following a tragic plane crash which killed Tony, renaming it Herdez Competition in 2001. Michel Jourdain, Jr. remained in the cockpit and Mario Dominguez replaced him in 2002, winning at Surfers Paradise and claiming Rookie of the Year. Herdez remained as title sponsor until 2005, with three further wins, by Ryan Hunter-Reay and Mario Dominquez and a dominant performance of first and second in the streets of Miami in 2003. In 2005 promising youngsters Bj√∂rn Wirdheim and Ronnie Bremer were signed, together with others to get through a tough season due to a lack of sponsorship. By that point the team had been renamed HVM (Herdez Viva Mexico) and in October 2005 Cedric the Entertainer announced he had become a partner in the team. The team's name changed in 2006 to CTE-HVM Racing. They finished fourth in the championship with Frenchman Nelson Philippe, who won at Surfers Paradise. In 2007, ex Minardi owner Paul Stoddart bought into the team and they renamed it Minardi Team USA fielding ex-F1 Driver Robert Doornbos and Dan Clarke for a second season, Wiggins being the managing partner. In the 2007 season, the team claimed 2 wins and 7 podiums on its way to third place in Championship standings and Rookie of the Year with Doornbos and a pole position for Clark. With Champ Car's unification with the Indy Racing League IndyCar Series in 2008, Stoddart left the team and it appeared that the team would shut down, however, Wiggins assumed full control of the team again and signed E. J. Viso to continue racing operations in the IndyCar Series, with the team's name reverting to HVM Racing. In 2010 the team brought new rookie driver Simona de Silvestro into IndyCar and she finished 14th at the Indianapolis 500 and became the 'Rookie of the Year'. HVM Racing earned six victories, three pole positions, 22 podiums, 40 top-five finishes and 97 top- tens. The team also earned \\"Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year\\" honors with driver Simona de Silvestro in 2010. HVM finished fourth and third, respectively, in the Champ Car World Series in 2006 and 2007, and earned drivers Mario Dominguez and Robert Doornbos Rookie of the Year honors in 2002 and 2007, respectively.

He is a former professional footballer whose clubs included Fulham, Queens Park Rangers (for whom he appeared as a substitute in the 1986 League Cup Final), Bristol City and West Ham United. Rosenior represented his birthplace England as a youth international, before formally switching to represent the Sierra Leone national football team. Rosenior has managed clubs including Gloucester City, Merthyr Tydfil, Torquay United, Brentford and was assistant to Gary Peters at Shrewsbury Town. His son, Liam, is a former professional footballer. Playing career =Club career= Rosenior was a striker for most of his career although towards the end of his playing days at Gloucester City he also turned out at centre-back, even in goal in a match against Kingstonian. He started at Fulham, also playing for Queens Park Rangers, West Ham United, Charlton Athletic, Bristol City and Fleet Town. =International career= He played for England at Under-16 and Under-21 levels but later changed allegiance to represent the Sierra Leone national team. In total he gained one cap for Sierra Leone, it came in the form of a 1994 African Nations Cup qualifying game versus Togo in Conakry on 9 January 1993. Togo later withdrew from the competition. Coaching and managerial career After a period as Bristol City's youth team coach Rosenior's first managerial post was with Southern League Premier side Gloucester City. His first full season in charge saw Gloucester lose a third replay in the FA Trophy semi-final to Dagenham and Redbridge and defeat on the final day of the season to Salisbury City cost a place in the Football Conference, with local rivals Cheltenham Town being promoted. Rosenior left the following season, taking over Bristol City's reserve side. Rosenior returned to non-league, managing Merthyr Tydfil before moving to Torquay United from July 2002 to January 2006, when he left the club by mutual consent after a 3‚Äì1 home defeat to Rochdale. In his second season in charge he took Torquay to promotion to Football League One, but was unable to keep them there, experiencing relegation on the last day of the season. The return to Football League Two heralded the departure of Alex Russell and Adebayo Akinfenwa, two of the club's best players. After languishing near the bottom of the league for half the season, Leroy eventually left the club by mutual consent. In March 2006, he was named first team coach at Shrewsbury Town, acting as assistant to manager Gary Peters. He left in June 2006 to take up the managerial position at Brentford, succeeding Martin Allen. 20 years earlier he had replaced Allen when he came on as a substitute in the 1986 League Cup final. Five months after his appointment, Rosenior left the club, after a run of 16 games without a win, which culminated in a 4‚Äì0 home defeat to Crewe Alexandra. He was scheduled to take charge of the Sierra Leone national side for a friendly against Leyton Orient in May 2007, which they won 4‚Äì2. It was announced in May 2007 that he would take charge of Sierra Leone in their upcoming African Nations Qualifiers. Rosenior returned to Torquay United as head coach on 17 May 2007, replacing Keith Curle, but was reportedly sacked after 10 minutes, which gave him the record of the shortest managerial reign in the history of English football.\\"Carl Fletcher: Leyton Orient manager sacked after 29 days in charge of League Two club\\" - BBC Sport, 14 November 2019 This was because at the same time Torquay were bought by a local consortium which installed Colin Lee as chief executive, who then appointed former Gulls player and Exeter City assistant manager Paul Buckle as manager.

In October 2013, it, along with ski terrain within the Club at Spanish Peaks, were consolidated into Big Sky Resort, making Big Sky the largest single ski resort in the United States, with 5,750 acres (2,330 ha) of terrain and over 30 ski lifts. The resort's land was purchased in 1992 from Big Sky Lumber Company and began as Moonlight Basin Ranch, a real estate development on the north edge of the adjacent Big Sky Resort. Moonlight Basin progressed slowly. It opened as an independent ski area in December 2003, on the north face of Lone Mountain. The 11,166 foot (3403 m) summit is accessed by the Lone Peak Tram, part of Big Sky. The resort, completely on private land, is adjacent to the Lee Metcalf Wilderness Area and posh Yellowstone Club in the Madison River drainage in Madison County. (The Big Sky Resort, also on private land, is in the Gallatin River drainage which drains into Gallatin County.) Moonlight Basin features the extreme terrain of The Headwaters. These steep chutes and gullies on the north face of Lone Mountain, once known as the \\"Nashville Bowl,\\" can be hiked to from the Headwaters lift (opened in December 2005) or Big Sky's Challenger lift, both of which unload at just under 10,000 feet (3048 m) above sea level. The resort also features terrain consisting of open bowls, tree skiing, moguls, long groomers, beginner runs, and a freestyle terrain park. A full day adult lift ticket for the first season was $39 for the 2008-2009 ski season. The Lone Peak Pass combines Big Sky and Moonlight Basin resorts and was $93 for the 2008-2009 season. The combined pass was first offered during the 2005-2006 season. The primary lift at Moonlight Basin is the Six Shooter, a high speed six pack chairlift that climbs 1850 vertical feet (564 m) from the base and is nicknamed \\"the flying couch.\\" The Headwaters chairlift connects at the top of Six Shooter, rising another 685 feet (209 m), for a total lift-served vertical rise of 2535 feet (772 m) from the 7000 foot (2134 m) base.http://www.moonlightbasin.com/site/mountain_detail.html The other upper lift is the Lone Tree quad, installed in 2004 for the second season, which allows access to the glade like terrain northwest of the Headwaters.http://www.billingsgazette.com/newdex.php?display=rednews/2004/04/30/build/state/20-big- sky-expands.inc Additional lift-served vertical is attained at Moonlight Basin by purchasing the Lone Peak Pass and taking Big Sky's tram to the summit of Lone Mountain. The two original chairlifts at Moonlight Basin, Iron Horse & Pony Express, were installed by Moonlight Basin Ranch in the mid-1990s before it was a stand-alone ski area. The lifts were operated by the Big Sky Resort. Moonlight Basin now offers golf on a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course known as The Reserve at Moonlight Basin. The par 72 layout is 7800 yards (7132 m) at an average elevation of 7500 feet (2286 m). A spa, fine dining, and a four hole short course have been added. The parent company of the ski resort, Moonlight Basin Ranch, has committed a significant percentage of its land holdings to conservation. The original 25,000 acres (10,000 ha) was purchased for $6.5 million by partners Lee Poole and Joe Vujovich of nearby Ennis, and Keith Brown of Fort Lauderdale, Florida from the Big Sky Lumber Company, a real estate development company created by Yellowstone Club founder Tim Blixseth and partners Mel and Norm MacDougal. The Moonlight Basin Ranch property sale by Blixseth and the MacDougal brothers was part of 165,000 acres (67,000 ha) they purchased from Plum Creek Timber for $27.5 million earlier in 1992. With 17,000 acres (6,900 ha) sold, the remaining 8,000 acres (3,200 ha) comprise the Moonlight Basin ski resort and golf course. Poole became the sole owner of Moonlight Basin, having bought the shares of the other two partnershttp://www.helenair.com/articles/2003/10/16/outdoors/c01101603_01.txt but in 2009 Moonlight Basin filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

It is most famous today as a Greenwich Village nightclub district. The street connects a neighborhood today popular for music venues and comedy, but which was once a major center for American bohemia. The street is named after the family name of Anthony Lispenard Bleecker, a banker, the father of Anthony Bleecker, a 19th-century writer, through whose family farm the street ran., p.29 Bleecker Street connects Abingdon Square (the intersection of Eighth Avenue and Hudson Street in the West Village) to the Bowery and East Village. History LeRoy Place, south side of Bleecker Street, drawn in 1831. After 1852, the economic status of the area declined and these aristocratic buildings were all demolished by 1875. Bleecker Street is named by and after the Bleecker family because the street ran through the family's farm. In 1808, Anthony Lispenard Bleecker and his wife deeded to the city a major portion of the land on which Bleecker Street sits. Originally Bleecker Street extended from Bowery to Broadway, along the north side of the Bleecker farm, later as far west as Sixth Avenue. In 1829 it was joined with Herring Street, extending Bleecker Street northwest to Abingdon Square. =LeRoy Place= LeRoy Place is the former name of a block of Bleecker Street between Mercer and Greene Streets. This was where the first palatial \\"winged residences\\" were built. The effect was accomplished by making the central houses taller and closer to the street, while the other houses on the side were set back. The central buildings also had bigger, raised entrances and lantern-like roof projections. The houses were built by Isaac A. Pearson, on both sides of Bleecker Street. To set his project apart from the rest of the area, Pearson convinced the city to rename this block of the street after the prominent international trader Jacob LeRoy., p. 459\\"Changing Types of City Dwellings: Statuary Marble Mantels Indicated the Fashionable Home of Former Age\\" The New York Times (November 22, 1914)\\"LeRoy Place\\" Moving Uptown, New York Public Library exhibition Transportation Bleecker Street is served by the at Bleecker Street/Broadway ‚Äì Lafayette Street station.

Beggarman, which is played fast, is a standard in their live set list and features a didgeridoo very prominently. Black is the Colour, sung by guitarist Steve Twigger, is very slow and mournful, reminiscent of the original composition from the previous album She Was the Prize. An Poc Ar Buile is the band's first venture in the Irish language. The song is normally slowly sung, but Gaelic Storm puts a twist into it by singing it fast, complete with hoots and hollers. Go Home, Girl is a faster tune about a girl who falls in love with a gypsy, only to have her advances turned down for an ironic reason. The Plouescat Races, Thirsty Work and Midnight Kiss are the instrumentals, some of which are original composition by the fiddle player Kathleen Keane. The tin whistle is also now prominently featured, especially in Thirsty Work. Before the Night is Over is an original love song. Johnny Tarr is a mainstay for the live set, complete with the nonsensical noise to start it off. It tells the tale of a heavy drinker who drank enough to kill a normal human, but he died of thirst instead. Swimmin' in the Sea is a nostalgic song about childhood at the sea and sung by the guitarist Steve Twigger. I Thought I Knew You, also sung by the guitarist, has fast lyrics with an unusual rhyme scheme about a relationship gone bad. Related to that is the last tune, original but sung by the fiddler, a slow and lamenting song about lonely life on the road. Mary's Eyes is a remake of a Janis Ian song, also sung by the fiddler, and is a mournful song about the homeland in the form of a girl.

The test was first developed by Dr. Carol Barnes in 1979.Barnes, CA (1979). \\"Memory deficits associated with senescence: a neurophysiological and behavioral study in the rat.\\" J Comp Physiol Psychol. 1979 Feb;93(1):74-104. The test subjects are usually rodents such as mice or lab rats, which either serve as a control or may have some genetic variable or deficiency present in them which will cause them to react to the maze differently. The basic function of Barnes maze is to measure the ability of a mouse to learn and remember the location of a target zone using a configuration of distal visual cues located around the testing area.Harrison F.E, Hosseini A.H, MacDonald M.P.(2009). \\"Endogenous anxiety and stress responses in water maze and Barnes maze spatial memory tasks.\\" Behavioural Brain Research 198 (2009) 247‚Äì251. This noninvasive task is useful for evaluating novel chemical entities for their effects on cognition as well as identifying cognitive deficits in transgenic strains of rodents that model for disease such as Alzheimer's disease.Reiserer, RS., Harrison F>E., Syverud, DC., McDonald, MP. Impaired spatial learning in the APPSwe + PSEN1DeltaE9 bigenic mouse model of Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. Genes Brain Behav. 6:54-65 (2007). It is also used by neuroscientists to determine whether there is a causative effect after mild traumatic brain injury on learning deficits (acquisition trials) and spatial memory retention (probe) at acute and chronic time points. This task is dependent on the intrinsic inclination of the subjects to escape from an aversive environment and on hippocampal-dependent spatial reference memory.Harrison FE, Hosseini AH, McDonald MP. 2009. Endogenous anxiety and stress responses in water maze and barnes maze spatial memory tasks. Behav Brain Res 198(1):247-51. Set-up The Barnes maze consists of a circular surface with up to 20 circular holes around its circumference. Visual cues, such as colored shapes or patterns, are placed around the table in plain sight of the animal. The table surface is brightly lit by overhead lighting. Under one of the holes is an \\"escape box\\" which can be reached by the rodent through the corresponding hole on the table top. The model is based on rodents' aversion of open spaces, which motivates the test subject to seek shelter in the escape box. A normal rodent will learn to find the escape box within four to five trials and will head directly toward the escape box without attempting to escape via incorrect holes. Various parameters are measured including latency to escape, path length, number of errors, and velocity. The selection of a background strain and the choice of behavioural tasks are significant in determining the outcome of an experiment. These variables help to verify that innate anxiety and cognitive ability differ considerably among mouse strains.Harrison, FE., Hosseini, AH., McDonald, MP. (2009) \\"Endogenous anxiety and stress responses in water maze and Barnes maze spatial memory tasks\\". Behavioural Brain Research. 198(1):247-251. Performance Barnes Maze Paths Performance is typically measured by number of errors the rodent makes, i.e. the number of times it pokes its nose into a hole that does not contain the escape box. The rate of decline in the number of errors per trial can be calculated to represent a learning curve. Other performance values can also be measured, such as path length to the escape box, with a shorter path indicating fewer errors. Additionally, the strategy used by each rodent can be scored as random (randomly checking each hole), systematic (checking each hole in a pattern) or spatial (direct movement to the hole with the drop box). Due to the spatial nature of the Barnes Maze, damage to the hippocampus leads to deficits in performance of the task.Fox, GB., Fan, L., LeVasseur, RA., Faden, AI. Effect of traumatic brain injury on mouse spatial and nonspatial learning in the Barnes circular maze. J Neurotrauma 15:1037-1046 (1998). An experiment done on degu, a specific rodent species, showed that there can be sex differences in performance on the Barnes Maze. During the task training where encoding would occur, females used more frequently a spatial strategy, while males preferably applied either serial, random or opposite strategies. In addition, it was noted that the spatial retention ability of female rats was largely dependent on the phase of their estrus cycle.Popovic, N, Madrid, J.A, Rol, M.A, Caballero-Bleda, M, Popvic M. (2010) \\"Barnes maze performance of Octodon degus is gender dependent\\". Behavioural Brain Research. Volume:212(2) The differences between males and females are found during the encoding period but not during the storage, indicating that acquisition and consolidation are differently influenced by sex in the Degu species. Comparison to other mazes The Barnes maze is similar to the Morris water navigation task and to the radial arm maze task, but does not utilize a strong aversive stimulus (stress induced by swimming such as in the Morris water maze) or deprivation (food or water deprivation such as in the radial arm maze) as reinforcement. Behavioral tasks involving high levels of stress can influence the animal's performanceHolscher C. Stress impairs performance in spatial water maze learning tasks. Behav Brain Res. 100:225-235 (1999). on the task, making the Barnes maze ideal for eliminating stress-induced confounds. However, due to the lack of a strong aversive stimuli, some rodents may lack motivation to complete the task. Once acclimated to the maze, subjects may prefer to explore instead of complete the task. Using different parameters to analyze the data is important for avoiding this issue. Latency, path length to escape box, and number of errors to the first nose poke at the escape hole have been used as measures previously.Harrison, FE., Reiserer, RS., Tomarken, AJ., McDonald, MP. Spatial and nonspatial escape strategies in the Barnes maze. Learn Mem. 13:809-819 (2006). Another drawback to the Barnes maze is that when testing multiple animals, scent cues left on the maze by the previous animal could alter the performance of subsequent subjects. This can be easily corrected by cleaning the maze after each trial.

The word \\"Dragaera\\" can refer to the planet, the Dragaeran Empire, or its former capital, Dragaera City. Species Dragaera is inhabited by several intelligent species, including: *Dragaerans, the dominant species of the world, were created when the Jenoine magically crossbred humans with various animals. Dragaerans average seven feet tall, with slender builds and very little muscular definition. They cannot grow beards and have very little body hair. Their lifespans are greatly enhanced, spanning several thousand years. They consider themselves \\"humans,\\" but are called \\"Dragaerans\\" by Easterners who live in the Empire. In other lands, Easterners call them \\"elfs\\" or \\"fairies.\\" *Easterners, identical to real-world humans or nearly so, occupy the lands to the east of the Dragaeran Empire, called the Eastern Kingdoms. They are considered barbarians by the Dragaerans, who frequently invade the Eastern Kingdoms. Smaller, weaker, shorter-lived, and without the aid of sorcery, Easterners have nonetheless managed to withstand Dragaeran hostility for hundreds of thousands of years. They consider themselves \\"humans,\\" but are called \\"Easterners\\" by Dragaerans of the Empire. In other lands, Dragaerans call them \\"dwarfs.\\" *Serioli, the original humanoid inhabitants of Dragaera, possess powerful magical abilities that have yet to be duplicated by Dragaerans or Easterners. They created all Morganti weapons, including the Great Weapons, and the written language of magic uses their alphabet. Despite their power, they were nearly wiped out in the early years of the Empire. Survivors hide in small mountain communities and occasionally come to aid those fighting against the Jenoine. They are small and ugly by Easterner standards. In addition, there are a number of immortal creatures that transcend the physical world of Dragaera to some degree, including: *Jenoine, a vastly powerful race of extradimensional creatures that made a number of modifications to the world of Dragaera for unknown reasons. Their thought processes are alien and difficult to understand even by the gods. They occasionally attempt to return to the planet to enslave it, but the gods and the most powerful Dragaerans fight them off. *Gods, powerful beings that take an active role in maintaining the Cycle of the Dragaeran Empire and keeping the Jenoine at bay. At least some gods were once servants of the Jenoine, but broke away from their masters. Others have since attained godhood through various means. The most powerful gods are called the Lords of Judgment. Easterners worship them, while Dragaerans respect them. *Demons, beings of great power who are similar to gods, but with the limitation that they can be controlled against their will. Magic Magic exists in many forms, and is thought to have its origins in the Jenoine's manipulations of the world. =Sorcery= Sorcery involves gathering power from physical manifestations of chaos, shaping it into spells, and releasing it. Citizens of the Dragaeran Empire can use the Imperial Orb as a conduit to access chaos safely. The Imperial Orb itself is linked to the Great Sea of Chaos, a body of liquid chaos called amorphia. Sorcery that does not use the Imperial Orb as a conduit is called Elder Sorcery or Pre-Empire Sorcery. It is performed by converting amorphia into small stones and accessing their power directly. Elder Sorcery is much more difficult, powerful, and dangerous than standard sorcery, and it has been outlawed by the Empire. A cataclysm resulting from a mishap with Elder Sorcery, called Adron's Disaster, destroyed the former capital Dragaera City (creating a new sea of chaos in its former location) and caused an interregnum in the Great Cycle and temporary collapse of the Empire. Before the Interregnum, sorcery was somewhat rare and less potent. During the Interregnum, the gods modified the Orb to increase the power of sorcery. Since the restoration of the Empire, sorcery has become far more common and powerful. Another theory is that it is not the Orb that was modified to make sorcery more powerful, but the extreme skill it took to work sorcery during the Interregnum lead to it being more powerful post-Interregnum. This theory is proposed by scholars, and later Verra herself. While the lower classes such as Teckla, and Easterners rarely learn any, all nobles of the Empire learn to perform at least a few basic spells. Exceptional skill takes a great deal of effort and study. Experts in any aspect of sorcery are distinguished as \\"wizards\\". Sorcery can take many shapes, but some of the most common uses include teleportation, telepathic communication, attack spells, and revivification. =Witchcraft= Used primarily by Easterners, witchcraft is a subtler form of magic that uses complex rituals to focus psychic energy. Witchcraft, being powered by the individual, lacks the raw power of sorcery, but can produce some unique effects that sorcery cannot replicate. Witchcraft spells grow in difficulty the more they change reality, whereas sorcery grows in difficulty as it becomes more complex, or needs to last longer. One unique ability of witchcraft is the acquisition of a familiar. Also, witchcraft can be performed with a group to enhance the power of the spell cast. Practitioners of both sexes are called \\"witches\\". Easterner witches tend to live longer than normal, and some rituals can preserve a witch's youth for hundreds of years. Other common feats of witchcraft include seeing auras, and telepathic communication. =Morganti Weapons= According to Dragaeran legend, the Serioli created Morganti weapons to make war so terrible that no one would ever start one. They are magical blades that destroy the soul of any person they cut, killing victims utterly with the smallest scratch and making resurrection or reincarnation impossible. Morganti weapons are semi- intelligent and yearn to \\"eat\\" the souls of victims. People near a Morganti weapon can feel its malevolent presence. Morganti daggers are often used by the Jhereg for particularly vindictive assassinations. The power of Morganti weapons varies. The most powerful are called Great Weapons, which possess a number of advantages over lesser Morganti blades. Great Weapons are more intelligent (they are considered sentient by the Serioli) and can exercise their will by choosing not to devour a soul, protecting their wielder from harm, and granting their wielder a number of magical abilities unique to the weapon. Several Great Weapons have been portrayed, including Blackwand, Godslayer (which Vlad, its owner, calls \\"Lady Teldra\\" after the Dragaeran whose personality is embedded in it), Iceflame, Pathfinder and Nightslayer. There are thought to be a total of 17 Great Weapons in existence, each with its own name and personality. They are the only weapons powerful enough to slay the Jenoine with one hundred percent certainty. The Dragaeran Empire =Overview= The Dragaeran Empire is the largest civilization on the planet and serves as the setting for the majority of Brust's novels set in Dragaera. It is a massive empire, covering more than half of the only known continent in the world, and has, at the point of the Vlad Taltos series, existed for about 250,000 years. It is a feudal society ruled by an Emperor or Empress from its capital city of Adrilankha, a bustling metropolis. The sky over the Empire is permanently overcast with reddish clouds due to millennia of magic usage.http://mindstalk.net/brust/dzurlordintro.html The Empire has the feel of Western Europe around the time of the Reformation,Small Invisible Lights but uses magic as a replacement for most technology. Despite the Empire's vast age, its culture has been remarkably stable, evolving only slowly. This is due in part to the very long lives of Dragaerans, in part to an ingrained respect for tradition, and in part to the meddling of the Dragaeran gods. The Empire is frequently at war with neighboring Dragaeran kingdoms as well as the Eastern Kingdoms. Warfare is handled through a combination of swordsmanship and sorcery. Soldiers rarely wear armor, as metal attracts sorcery. Bows and other mundane projectile weapons are extremely rare. Due to the almost complete lack of gender role differentiation in Dragaeran society, women are just as likely to be found in the military as any other profession. =The Imperial Orb= The Orb is a floating, glowing sphere of enormous magical power that serves as the source of the Emperor's authority and the linchpin of the Empire. The Orb and the reigning Emperor share an almost-unbreakable magic link. The Orb will protect the Emperor from almost all harm, making him or her virtually immune to assassination. The Emperor can consult the memories of all previous emperors through the Orb. The Orb constantly changes colors to reflect the Emperor's current mood. All citizens of the Empire are linked to the Orb as well, and can use it to access sorcery. The Orb also performs more mundane services such as broadcasting the precise time of day and serving as a lie detector during Imperial trials. According to legend, the Orb was created by Zerika the First, a co-founder of the Empire and the first Empress. Another theory is that the Orb was created by the Jenoine but activated or usurped by Zerika. It is not completely understood by most Dragaerans, though it is believed to be indestructible. To save the Orb from Adron's Disaster, the Orb was transported to the Paths of the Dead. Empress Zerika IV retrieved it from there, ending the interregnum period. =The Great Houses= All citizens of the Empire are divided into seventeen houses, each represented by an animal. According to Sethra Lavode, who was there, there were thirty-one tribes in earlier timesBrust, S:Issola, Ch. 2. 2001 but some houses have since merged or died out. It is also believed that the members of each House (except for the Jhereg) are descended from Dragaerans that were mingled most prominently with their House's animal when the Jenoine created the species. With few exceptions, membership in a House is determined by birth. Most Dragaeran Houses resemble clans, with all members of a given House related by blood. Certain facial features are strongly associated with most Houses, and most Houses have official colors that members wear prominently, making the House membership of most Dragaerans visually apparent. In addition, certain temperaments, talents, and vocations are strongly associated with each House. Mating outside of one's House is taboo among Dragaerans, and half-breeds are considered outcasts. The House of the Jhereg, founded by mixed-house outcasts, is an exception to both of these rules: noble titles in the House of the Jhereg can be bought for a suitable bribe, and half-breeds are not looked upon so severely. The peasants of the Empire come from the House of the Teckla, forming 90% of the Empire's population. Anyone who swears allegiance on the Orb can become a citizen of the Empire as a Teckla, including Easterners. All Houses but the Teckla are considered Noble Houses, though some are more noble than others. Members of the lower Houses, including the Jhereg, Orca, and Chreotha, form the Empire's middle class, working as merchants and artisans. The intermediate Houses, including the Athyra, Yendi, and Issola, tend to work as academics and professionals. Between five and seven of the most noble Houses, depending on opinion, make up the \\"true aristocracy\\" of the Empire,Brust, Steven: Jhegaala, page 205. 2008 such as Phoenix, Dragon, Dzur, and Tiassa. The animals representing each House are unique to the world of Dragaera. Those that share a name with a real or mythical animal of Earth are not the same creature. The Great Houses are as follows (in order of their precedence in the cycle), with their two primary representative characteristics.Brust, S: Jhegaala, page 7. 2008 * Phoenix‚ÄîDecadence and Rebirth * Dragon‚ÄîWar and Conquest * Lyorn‚ÄîTradition and Duty * Tiassa‚ÄîCatalyst and Inspiration * Hawk‚ÄîObservation and Perception * Dzur‚ÄîHeroism and Honor * Issola‚ÄîCourtliness and Surprise * Tsalmoth‚ÄîUnpredictability and Tenacity * Vallista‚ÄîCreation and Destruction * Jhereg‚ÄîGreed and Opportunism * Iorich‚ÄîJustice and Retribution * Chreotha‚ÄîForethought and Ensnarement * Yendi‚ÄîSubtlety and Misdirection * Orca‚ÄîBrutality and Mercantilism * Teckla‚ÄîCowardice and Fertility * Jhegaala‚ÄîMetamorphosis and Endurance * Athyra‚ÄîMagic and Philosophy =The Cycle= The Cycle is a magically-spinning wheel in the Halls of Judgment that controls the reign of the Emperor and the political fate of the Houses. Each of the 17 Houses is represented along the wheel. When a House reaches the top of the wheel, it chooses one of its members to reign as Emperor. When the wheel turns enough to bring the next House to the top, the former Emperor relinquishes the throne, willingly or not, and a new one reigns. The House of a former Emperor becomes \\"descending\\" and loses power until it reaches the bottom of the Cycle. After a House rounds the bottom, it becomes \\"rising\\", gaining power until it reaches the top and reigns again. The order of the Houses along the Cycle is: Phoenix, Dragon, Lyorn, Tiassa, Hawk, Dzur, Issola, Tsalmoth, Vallista, Jhereg, Iorich, Chreotha, Yendi, Orca, Teckla, Jhegaala, Athyra. The order is structured so that each Emperor is naturally suited to fix the mistakes of the previous Emperor, thus keeping the Cycle constantly spinning. A notable exception is the peasant House of the Teckla, which institutes a short-lived republic during its reign. The figurative role of each house in the Cycle is described in the Cycle Poem, which is printed as an epigraph in several books of the series and makes various appearances in the stories. Where the Cycle came from, what makes it turn, and how exactly it is linked to the Empire is not completely understood. The Cycle turns at varying speeds for unknown reasons, but a reign is never shorter than 289 (17^2) years, and never longer than 4,913 (17^3) years. Determining when the Cycle shifts is a matter of magic and guesswork because living citizens almost never physically see the Cycle. The next House on the Cycle often attempts to seize power when it believes the Cycle has shifted. If the House succeeds, this is taken as proof that it was right. It was also said that if a person can go to the Cycle and is strong enough to turn it, then the Cycle will truly change. During the time of the Vlad Taltos series, there is only one remaining member of the House of the Phoenix, causing some characters to question whether the Cycle can continue. =The Paths of the Dead= When Dragaeran citizens of the Empire die, their souls go to the Paths of the Dead, a physical labyrinth in the Greymist Valley of Dragaera. Bodies are generally sent over the Blood River at Deathsgate Falls to facilitate the soul's entrance. Each House has its own path and trials that its members must face. At the end of the Labyrinth are the Halls of Judgment, where the Lords of Judgment sit and determine the fate of Dragaeran souls that reach them. Those they deem worthy for their own uses are allowed into the next state of being. Those they reject are reincarnated or bound to serve in the Halls. It is possible for living creatures to enter the Paths, but it is extremely difficult to leave. Very rarely, Dragaerans will become undead to leave the Halls without reincarnating.

Overview As one of the many collections issued by Rogers, The Kenny Rogers Story: 20 Golden Hits was issued in the UK in 1985. It was never released in the US, and collects most of his UK Top 40 pop hits as well as various other singles that, while they never made it to high positions in the mainstream charts there, were popular among fans of both country and easy listening/middle of the road genres. It is similar to the 1983 issued 20 Greatest Hits from the US. For this album, Rogers sang solo several songs from his days with The First Edition in the 1960s and early 1970s, including the No. 1 hit \\"Ruby, Don't Take Your Love to Town\\" and the top ten success \\"Something's Burning\\", as well as \\"Reuben James\\" (while this was not a pop hit in Britain, it was nevertheless well known, receiving regular airplay). Elsewhere the album includes tracks from his solo days with United Artists Records and Liberty Records. (See below for song list). Some fans have been bemused as to why his 1983 hit single with Dolly Parton, \\"Islands in the Stream\\", is \\"missing\\" on this collection. However, this track was recorded with RCA Nashville after Kenny left Liberty. In addition to being issued on the popular formats of vinyl, cassette and compact disc, The Kenny Rogers Story was also issued on the short lived Digital Compact Cassette. The album was eventually deleted in the mid-1990s following the release of the similar themed collection Daytime Friends - The Very Best of Kenny Rogers. =Chart performance= The Kenny Rogers Story was a huge success reaching No. 1 in the UK country albums chart and No. 4 on the pop chart . It remained one of the top selling country collections for over four years, out-selling all his previous albums, and was the biggest selling country album of 1985 in the UK. In 1989, it still ranked No. 2 on the UK chart. =Album art= In what seems a tradition with Rogers' UK releases, where artwork is oft-duplicated, this album matches the 1985 album Love Is What We Make It.

Founded in 1903, it was the first post-secondary institution established in British Columbia, and served as the predecessor to the University of Victoria. As a result, the history, and traditions of the institution are perpetuated by the University of Victoria. The institution was established in 1903 as an affiliated college of McGill University, based at Victoria High School. Victoria College suspended operations when the University of British Columbia (UBC) opened to the public in 1915. Victoria College resumed operations in 1921 at Craigdarroch Castle, as an affiliate of UBC. An influx in enrolment following the Second World War led the institution to move to a new location in the Uplands neighbourhood of Victoria. The institution continued to operate as an affiliated college until 1963, when it was reorganized into an independent institution, the University of Victoria. History =McGill affiliate (1903‚Äì1915)= Victoria High School in 1912. The first iteration of Victoria College shared facilities with the high school. Victoria College was a two-year college which provided students in Victoria, British Columbia with post-secondary education. Between the years 1903 and 1915, Victoria College was affiliated with McGill University, offering first- and second-year McGill courses in Arts and Science. Administered locally by the Victoria School Board, the College was an adjunct to Victoria High School and shared its facilities. Both institutions were under the direction of a single Principal, E.B. Paul from 1903 to 1908; and S.J. Willis from 1908 to 1915. After the University of British Columbia opened to the public in 1915, the College was forced to suspend post-secondary operations. =UBC affiliate (1921‚Äì1963)= In 1920, as a result of local demands, Victoria College began the second stage of its development, reborn as an affiliated institution of the University of British Columbia. Though still administered by the Victoria School Board, the College was now completely separated from Victoria High School, moving September 27, 1921, into Craigdarroch Castle. The institution was opened as a two-year institution, allowing students to complete the first two years of their bachelor's degree at Victoria College, before completing it at UBC. The institution was managed under principals E.B. Paul, and his successor, P.H. Elliott, providing scholarly instruction in first- and second-year arts and science. Principal of Victoria College, J.M. Ewing, and his successor, W.H. Hickman, helped manage the institution's growth following the Second World War, as well as its later transition from an affiliated institution into an independent institution. During this period, the College was governed by the Victoria College Council, representative of the University of British Columbia, the Greater Victoria School Board, and the provincial Department of Education. The first major change to the institution during this period occurred in 1946, when the College was forced by postwar enrolment to move from Craigdarroch to the Lansdowne campus of the Provincial Normal School (presently a part of Camosun College Lansdowne campus). The provincial normal school was later merged with Victoria College in 1956, becoming the College's Faculty of Education. Late during this period, of land at Gordon Head was acquired by Victoria College, with the co-operation of the Department of National Defence and the Hudson's Bay Company. The University of British Columbia later authorized its bachelor's degrees to be awarded at Victoria College. The first students that completed their studies entirely in Victoria were awarded UBC bachelor's degrees from the College in 1961. In 1963, Victoria College was reorganized through a charter as the University of Victoria, becoming an independent university. Traditions =Athletics= Victoria College students were active in many different sports and athletic activities. The warm, temperate climate of Victoria allows for extended sporting seasons and little rain. The rivers and ocean around Victoria provided excellent opportunities for rowing and sailing teams. The two sports continue to be popular sports at the University of Victoria. =Fight Song= Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as commencement and convocation, and athletic games is 'Rack and Ruin' a reminder of the tradition of the founding Victoria College. The Fight Song is still sung by the University of Victoria rowing club and soccer teams. ''' \\"Rack and Ruin, Blood and Gore, Victoria College Evermore!\\"''''' Faculty and staff The staff of Victoria College started small and catered to the community. At its founding, it including a staff of just two faculty members, with the inaugural class consisting of four women and three men. The students and faculty members continued to steadily grow over the course of the first half of the twentieth- century.

It was released in 1959 as a double feature with The Alligator People. It was directed by Edward Bernds. Unlike the previous film, Return of the Fly was shot in black and white. Vincent Price was the only returning cast member from the original. It was intended that Herbert Marshall reprise his role as the police inspector, but due to illness he was replaced by John Sutton.p.122 Weaver, Tom Brett Halsey interview in Eye on Science Fiction: 20 Interviews with Classic SF and Horror Filmmakers McFarland, 2007 The film was followed by a second sequel, Curse of the Fly (1965). Plot Now an adult, Phillipe Delambre (Brett Halsey) is determined to vindicate his father by successfully completing the experiment he had worked on. His uncle Fran√ßois (Vincent Price) refuses to help. Phillipe hires Alan Hines from Delambre Frere and uses his own finances, but the funds run out before the equipment is complete. When Phillipe threatens to sell his half of Delambre Frere, Fran√ßois relents and funds the completion. After some adjustments, they use the transporter to \\"store\\" and later re-materialize test animals. Alan Hines turns out to be Ronald Holmes, an industrial spy. Holmes tries to sell the secrets to a shadowy cohort named Max. Before Holmes can get away with the papers, a British agent confronts him. Holmes knocks him out and uses the transporter to \\"store\\" the body. When rematerialized, the agent has the paws of a guinea pig that had been disintegrated earlier, and the guinea pig has human hands. Holmes kills the rodent and puts the dead agent in his car, which he sends into the Saint Lawrence River. Phillipe confronts Holmes about all the oddities, with a fight ensuing and Phillipe being knocked out. Holmes hides Phillipe the same way he did the agent, but in a twist of malice he catches a fly and adds it to the transporter with him. Fran√ßois re-materializes Phillipe, but with a giant fly head, arm and leg (whereas the tiny fly has his head, arm and leg). The fly-headed Phillipe runs into the night, tracking down and killing Max. He waits for Holmes to arrive and kills him, too, then returns home, where Inspector Beecham has found and captured the Phillipe- headed fly. Both are placed in the device together and successfully reintegrated, restoring Phillipe to his normal human form.

The budget was more than the normal $125,000 for Lippert productions. He says that the budget was $275,000 ‚Äì $25,000 of which went to Vincent Price's fee. Bernds says his original draft of the film incorporated footage from the first Fly movie but they were not allowed to use it. He also said Vincent Price insisted on reading the script before signing on to the film. Once he did, he objected when Bernds cut down on some of his scenes for length. Filming started 2 February 1959. During a particular dialogue scene, actor David Frankham rather conspicuously handles a cane, which closely resembles the wolf-head walking stick famously utilized in Universal's film, The Wolf Man (1941). The script of the film was written specifically to use the standing sets from The Fly (1958), on the Fox lot in Westwood.

The label owners were Jack and Devora Brown, their son Sheldon Brown recorded for the label. Original releases tapered off after 1972 aside from a few albums in the mid-1980s. Fortune specialized in R&B;, blues, soul and doo- wop music, although the label also released pop, big band, hillbilly, gospel, rock and roll, and polka records. History Fortune released some doo-wop tunes by Nolan Strong & The Diablos, such as \\"The Wind\\" (Fortune 511, 1954), \\"The Way You Dog Me Around\\" (Fortune 518, 1955), and \\"Mind Over Matter\\" (Fortune 546, 1962). Other notable artists on Fortune included John Lee Hooker, Andre Williams, and Nathaniel Mayer & The Fabulous Twilights (whose release, \\"Village of Love,\\" on both Fortune 545 and United Artists 449 in the spring of 1962, was perhaps its most popular release; it reached No. 22 pop and No. 16 R&B; on the Billboard chart). \\"Village of Love\\" also made the Top Ten in local radio station surveys in New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago. It was No. 1 in Detroit. Prior to \\"Village of Love,\\" Fortune's biggest-selling record was likely \\"Bacon Fat\\" (Fortune 831 and Epic 9196, late 1956) by Andre Williams and His New Group (Which was 5 Dollars on Fortune not Epic), which featured Williams' proto-rap over a sleazy, bluesy arrangement. \\"Bacon Fat\\" (the name of the song refers to a dance) reached No. 9 R&B; on the Billboard chart in early 1957 after it was leased to Columbia's Epic subsidiary for national distribution. The Five Dollars were from Detroit and were originally known as The Shamrocks and The Del Torros. The members of the group were lead singer Eddie Hurt, tenors Lonnie Heard and Richard Lawrence, baritone James Drayton, and bass Charles Evans. After working on their music and stage presence, they picked up a manager named Sandy Amour and began to sing at area clubs and talent shows. What they were looking for most at the time was a chance to record, and soon in 1955 that goal was realized with a session at home town independent Fortune Records. On August 20, 1955 Dorothy Brown of Fortune announced the signing of the group along with Andre Williams (who was related through marriage to Eddie Hurt) who would also record with the Five Dollars. The newly renamed Five Dollars recorded some songs for Fortune and in the late summer of 1955 the label released \\"Doctor Baby\\" and \\"Harmony Of Love\\" on # 821. Richard Lawrence was soon drafted into the military and so the Five Dollars became a vocal quartet. In October Fortune released \\"Going Down To Tijuana\\" and Jump, Shake, And Move\\" by Andre Williams and the group which was billed on the label as Andre Williams & The Don Juans which was released on #824. In December 1955, Fortune Records announces the release of The Five Dollars with \\"So Strange\\" and \\"You Know I Can't Refuse\\" on # 826. However, the record was not actually released until March 1956. Early in 1956 the group recorded again as The Don Juans this time behind vocalist Joe Weaver on \\"Baby I Love You So\\" and \\"It Must Be Love\\" on # 825. During the spring the group once again as The Don Juans provided backup vocals - this time for vocalist Don Lake on the tunes \\"Oh Oh Those Eyes\\" and \\"Cha Cha Of Love\\" on Fortune # 520. In August 1956, an interesting bill was put together for a stage show in Windsor, Canada (right across the river from Detroit). Featured on the bill was Stan Kenton and his Progressive Jazz Orchestra, The NiteCaps, Diabolos, and the group now called The Four Dollars. That same month Fortune re-released \\"Going Down To Tia Juana\\" by Andre Williams & The Don Juans. In September \\"Bobby Jean\\" and \\"It's All Over\\" by Andre & The Don Juans is issued by Fortune on # 828, quickly followed by \\"Cool As A Cucumber\\" and \\"Going Back To Chicago\\" on # 829. In October back as The Five Dollars recorded \\"Hard Workin' Mama\\" and \\"I Will Wait\\" on # 830. Late in the year Andre Williams with The Don Juans hit with \\"Bacon Fat\\" and \\"Just Because Of A Kiss\\" on # 831. This time the record gets a lot of attention and generates sales especially in the Midwest. In January 1957, Joe Weaver on vocals with The Don Juans records \\"Looka Here Pretty Baby\\" and \\"Baby Chile\\" on # 832. In April The group as The Five Dollars records the sequel called \\"How To Do The Bacon Fat\\" on # 833 with Fortune Records pushing the record as part of the dance craze with DJ radio contests as a tie in. The flip side is \\"You Fool\\". In May \\"You Are My Sunshine\\" and \\"Mean Jean\\" by Andre Williams & The Don Juans is released on # 834. In August Fortune releases \\"This Is A Miracle\\" and \\"Calypso Beat\\" on # 836 as by Little Eddie (Hurt) & The Don Juans. Andre Williams was back fronting the group on \\"My Tears\\" with Andre as a solo on \\"Jail Bait\\" on # 837. The group had one last record in 1957 with Andre on lead on \\"Come On Baby\\" and \\"The Greasy Chicken\\" on Fortune # 839 In 1958 Andre & The Don Juans recorded \\"My Last Dance With You\\" and \\"Hey ! Country Girl\\" on # 842. The Five Dollars record with Jim Sands on lead on the Hi-Q label with \\"We're Gonna Rock\\" and \\"You Don't Know My Mind\\" on # 5010. In December 1959, Andre Williams and Gino Parks with the Walter Hamilton Combo recorded \\"Georgia May Is Movin\\" with The Diabolos, and \\"Andre Williams Is Movin\\" with The Five Dollars on Fortune # 851. In 1960 there were two last records by the group. \\"That's The Way It Goes\\" and \\"My baby-Oh\\" on Fortune # 854, and as The Don Juans - \\"It's Nice\\" and \\"Our Chalypso Of Love\\" behind the lead vocals of Marsha Renay. Record collectors often find Fortune's numbering system confusing because there were several series issued at once, and also because some particular record numbers were used more than once. From the early 1950s to fall 1956, Fortune had a storefront at 11629 Linwood (now demolished). However, Fortune's best-known location was at 3942 Third Avenue in a small concrete block building. Fortune moved there in the fall of 1956 and stayed there until the mid-1990s, when the building was sold and vacated. (The landmark building was demolished late in 2001.) The storefront contained a record shop in the front (the Browns sold their product direct to the public) and the crude 18-by-40 studio in the rear (which originally had a dirt floor). Whereas its far bigger Detroit rival, Motown Records, perfected a highly polished pop sound, releases on Fortune Records were often characterized by raw, unrestrained vocal performances and relatively simple instrumental arrangements, recorded without excessive care for production values. Recording was accomplished via a few microphones to an Ampex one-track tape deck. As a result, the label's records have a distinctively direct sound and often packed considerable emotional power. It is estimated that Fortune Records and its subsidiaries, Hi-Q Records and Strate-8, released approximately 400 45-RPM vinyl records, as well as long- playing albums, during its existence. The Fortune Records studio and office on Third Avenue in Detroit was demolished October 27, 2001. Sheldon Brown still controls the Fortune Records catalogue, which is managed by Westwood Music Group. Yeah Mama Records has issued the Fortune catalog on CDs with distribution by The Orchard unit of Sony Music.

The band is named for Tindale's mother. Their songs are underpinned with darker scarred lyrics (suggested in interviews to have been inspired by the death of Cafiso's father) causing them to be famously compared to, 'a candy apple with a razor blade inside'. Musical influences of the band vary from 1960s rock outfits The Beatles, The Velvet Underground and most associated, The Beach Boys, to early 1990s noise rock pioneers My Bloody Valentine, and The Breeders. History Albums Joy Zipper (Eponymous LP) Joy Zipper's first album was recorded at home on an 8-track in 1999 and was first released in the UK on EyeQ Records that same year. In 2000 it was released on US label Bar/None Records (Yo La Tengo, Of Montreal, Alex Chilton). The single Christine Bonilla was featured on Another Late Night: Zero 7.

Other terms, include respiratory or cardio-thoracic physiotherapy. CPT are treatments which are performed on people suffering from mucus dysfunction in respiratory disease conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchitis, bronchiectasis and cystic fibrosis. With these respiratory conditions, they all have a common requirement of chest physiotherapy to assist the mucus clearance due to defects with mucociliary clearance. Techniques include chest percussion using clapping: the therapist lightly claps the patient's chest, back, and area under the arms. Percussion, while effective in the treatment of infants and children, is no longer used in adults due to the introduction of more effective and self-management focused treatments.

The line was the backbone of the Steelers dynasty, which won four Super Bowls (IX, X, XIII, and XIV) in six years. The Steelers began their 1976 season 1‚Äì4 and lost their quarterback, Terry Bradshaw. For the nine games remaining in the season, the Steelers recorded five shutouts (three of them uninterrupted), and only allowed two touchdowns (both in a single game), and five field goals. The defense allowed an average 3.1 points per game and the team had an average margin of victory of 22 points. Eight of the Steelers' starting eleven defensive players were selected for the Pro Bowl that year, and four would be selected to the Hall of Fame.  Lineup  The Steel Curtain included: * No. 75 \\"Mean\\" Joe Greene ‚Äì defensive tackle 1969‚Äì1981, 4-time Super Bowl champion (IX, X, XIII, XIV), 10-time Pro Bowl selection (1969‚Äì1976, 1978, 1979), 2-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year (1972, 1974), NFL 1970s All-Decade Team, Pro Football Hall of Fame, Pittsburgh Steelers All-Time Team * No. 68 L.

Origin of the Legacy name  The nickname \\"Steel Curtain\\", a play on the phrase \\"Iron Curtain\\" popularized by former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, originated in a 1971 contest sponsored by Pittsburgh radio station WTAE to name the defense. The name was also a play on Pittsburgh's reputation for steel production. The contest was won by Gregory Kronz, a ninth grader at a suburban high school. According to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, \\"he was just one of 17 people who submitted the 'Steel Curtain' moniker to the WTAE contest, necessitating a drawing for the grand prize,\\" which Kronz won.

It was founded at Castle Garden in Battery Park, Manhattan in 1896, and moved to Coney Island in 1957. The aquarium is operated by the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) as part of its integrated system of four zoos and one aquarium, most notably the Bronx Zoo. It is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). As part of WCS, the aquarium's mission is to save wildlife and wild places worldwide through science, conservation action, education, and inspiring people to value nature. The facility occupies and boasts 266 species of aquatic wildlife. Its mission is to raise public awareness about issues facing the ocean and its inhabitants with special exhibits, public events and research. The New York Seascape program, based out of the aquarium, is WCS‚Äôs local conservation program designed to restore healthy populations of marine species and protect New York waters, which are vital to the area‚Äôs economic and cultural vitality. History = Battery Park location = The aquarium used to be housed in Castle Clinton (left) in Battery Park (image before 1923) The New York Aquarium opened on December 10, 1896, at Castle Garden in Battery Park. Its first director was Tarleton Hoffman Bean (1895‚Äì1898). He was also instrumental in helping to create similar wild life organizations, especially aquaria. On October 31, 1902, the Aquarium was put under the administration of the New York Zoological Society. At the time, the Aquarium housed only 150 specimens of wildlife. Over time, its most famous director, the distinguished zoologist Charles Haskins Townsend, enlarged the collections considerably, and the Aquarium attracted hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. A towering figure in New York Zoological Society and New York Aquarium history, Doctor Townsend served as the Aquarium's director for thirty years. Townsend's work with whaling bans, Gal√°pagos tortoise conservation and the development of aquarium technology are on par with the work of William Temple Hornaday. Early in October 1941, the Aquarium at Battery Park was controversially closed based on claims of NYC Parks Commissioner Robert Moses that the proposed construction of the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel from Lower Manhattan to Brooklyn might undermine Castle Clinton's foundation. Many of the Aquarium‚Äôs sea creatures were temporarily housed at the Bronx Zoo until the new aquarium was built after World War II. = Brooklyn location = On June 6, 1957, the Aquarium opened at its new location in Coney Island, Brooklyn. The new site of the New York Aquarium is the home of the WCS New York Seascape program ‚Äì the society‚Äôs research and conservation program focusing on nearby rivers, harbor, and ocean from Cape May, New Jersey to Montauk, Long Island. The aquarium kept an orca briefly in 1968 and a narwhal in 1969. Both reportedly died of possible pneumonia. The aquarium's beluga whales were transferred to the Georgia Aquarium in 2007 as part of a breeding program.Belugas sent to breed In September 2011, the aquarium named its new electric eel Wattson, and in March 2012, it launched a sea horse breeding program. In October 2006, the New York Aquarium announced the finalists to a competition to develop a more inviting and visually prominent exterior for the aquarium. In March 2007, the winning design by firms WRT and Cloud 9 was selected, which featured an enclosure resembling a whale over the aquarium. However, in March 2008, that concept was scrapped due to concerns over the cost of the design and the practicality of constructing future exhibits under the enclosure. Instead, plans for a new exhibit based on sharks were announced. The massive , exhibition, Ocean Wonders: Sharks!, was originally scheduled to break ground in November 2012 and open in 2015. However, the New York Aquarium was significantly damaged by Hurricane Sandy in October 2012, which severely flooded the facility and shut down power. A small group of WCS staff who remained onsite during the hurricane were able to save 90 percent of the animals in the collection. As a result, construction on the exhibit was delayed. Ocean Wonders: Sharks! ultimately broke ground in January 2014. The exhibit opened on June 30, 2018, becoming the first major exhibit at the New York Aquarium to open after Hurricane Sandy. The aquarium closed for four months starting in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in New York City, which shuttered almost all businesses citywide. With the reopening of the aquarium in July 2020, a new exhibit called Spineless, dedicated to invertebrate marine species, was opened. Exhibits , the New York Aquarium consists of five exhibits: Aquatheater; Conservation Hall; Sea Cliffs; Sharks, Rays & Turtles; and Ocean Wonders: Sharks. The original Bathysphere, a deep- sea submersible that made historic journeys underwater in the 1930s, is on display at the aquarium.

A social host is most often a private individual who serves alcohol in a non-commercial setting. Persons subject to social-host liability in civil actions are typically those that provided alcohol to the obviously intoxicated social guests who subsequently are involved in vehicle crashes or other activities causing death or injury to third parties, or to minors who are injured as a result of intoxication that results from service of alcohol by the host, but the circumstances under which social host liability can result varies by jurisdiction. Most people are aware that serving alcohol to people who are below the legal age for the consumption of alcohol is illegal in the United States. Exceptions from that prohibition for service of alcohol to minors in family settings, for religious reasons and other purposes varies by state. In some states a person who serves alcohol to a minor may potentially be held liable if the alcohol provided is found to have contributed to the commission of a crime. A social host who knowingly serves alcohol to minors or knowingly allows minors to consume alcohol may also potentially face criminal charges. United States Within the United States, social host liability for the service of alcohol can vary greatly from state to state. Thirty-one states allow for social host liability for damages or injuries caused by underaged drinkers. If the underage drinking took place in a minor's home, even if the minor's parents were not present and did not provide the alcohol, the minor's parents may potentially be held liable if they knew or should have known that an underage party would occur while they were away at which minors would consume alcohol, they can potentially be held liable for the minor party- goers' actions on and off their property. In some states, such as New Hampshire, a minor who serves other minors may be liable for injuries that result from the service. =Dram shop acts= A related body of law known in the United States as dram shop liability governs the liability of taverns, liquor stores, and other commercial establishments that serve alcoholic beverages. Canada In Canada, social host liability for the service of alcohol to adult guests was restricted by the Supreme Court in the case of Childs v. Desormeaux. The court found that social hosts do not have a duty of care to third parties who are injured by an intoxicated guest. The court did not address whether a duty could arise where a social host continued to serve a clearly intoxicated guest with knowledge that the guest would later drive a vehicle.

SEER-SEM version 1.0 was released on 13 5.25\\" floppy disks and was an early product running on Windows version 2. Designing SEER-SEM for Windows was considered risky as the operating system had yet to establish itself as a viable competitor to the current dominant OS, Microsoft's MS-DOS. However, the adoption of a Windows-based format proved to be worthwhile, allowing SEER-SEM to offer a much more intuitive user interface than would have otherwise been available in MS-DOS. Galorath chose Windows due to the ability to provide a more graphical user environment, allowing more robust management tradeoffs and understanding of what drives software projects.Galorath, D & Evans M. (2006) Software Sizing, Estimation, and Risk Management Page xxii =Next Versions= Since that initial release in 1988, SEER-SEM has undergone numerous upgrades, keeping up with changing technology, adapting to better meet the needs of the customer, and altering the model to achieve more precise estimates. For example, the 1994 release of SEER-SEM version 4 included major enhancements to the core math behind the model, handling the realities of projects rather than just a Rayleigh curve approximation, as well as dozens more knowledge bases and the latest research in software science and complexity metrics. 2003 saw SEER-SEM add significant new features such as Goal Setting and Risk Tuning. Both features operated as their names suggest with Risk Analysis allowing project managers to make changes to estimates and Goal Setting allowing for projects to not only be estimated, but also to be managed. Version 6 of SEER for Software was the first to be fully COM-enabled, allowing SEER to both input and output through various Microsoft products, such as Excel. Version 7 included better handling of projects that stretch beyond their optimal effort.Galorath, D & Evans M.

Its current primary API relies on Microsoft Automation. The program itself is written in C and C++. Group of Models SEER for Software (SEER-SEM) is composed of a group of models working together to provide estimates of effort, duration, staffing, and defects. These models can be briefly described by the questions they answer: * Sizing. How large is the software project being estimated (Lines of Code, Function Points, Use Cases, etc.) * Technology. What is the possible productivity of the developers (capabilities, tools, practices, etc.) * Effort and Schedule Calculation. What amount of effort and time are required to complete the project? * Constrained Effort/Schedule Calculation. How does the expected project outcome change when schedule and staffing constraints are applied? * Activity and Labor Allocation. How should activities and labor be allocated into the estimate? * Cost Calculation. Given expected effort, duration, and the labor allocation, how much will the project cost? * Defect Calculation. Given product type, project duration, and other information, what is the expected, objective quality of the delivered software? * Maintenance Effort Calculation. How much effort will be required to adequately maintain and upgrade a fielded software system? * Progress. How is the project progressing and where will it end up. Also how to replan. * Validity. Is this development achievable based on the technology involved? Software Sizing Software size is a key input to any estimating model and across most software parametric models. Supported sizing metrics include source lines of code (SLOC), function points, function-based sizing (FBS) and a range of other measures. They are translated for internal use into effective size (S_{e}). S_{e} is a form of common currency within the model and enables new, reused, and even commercial off-the-shelf code to be mixed for an integrated analysis of the software development process. The generic calculation for S_{e} is: S_{e} = NewSize + ExistingSize * (0.4 * Redesign + 0.25 * Reimpl + 0.35 * Retest) As indicated, S_{e} increases in direct proportion to the amount of new software being developed. S_{e} increases by a lesser amount as preexisting code is reused in a project. The extent of this increase is governed by the amount of rework (redesign, re- implementation, and retest) required to reuse the code. Function-Based Sizing While SLOC is an accepted way of measuring the absolute size of code from the developer's perspective, metrics such as function points capture software size functionally from the user's perspective. The function-based sizing (FBS) metric extends function points so that hidden parts of software such as complex algorithms can be sized more readily. FBS is translated directly into unadjusted function points (UFP). In SEER-SEM, all size metrics are translated to S_{e}, including those entered using FBS. This is not a simple conversion, i.e., not a language-driven adjustment as is done with the much-derided backfiring method. Rather, the model incorporates factors, including phase at estimate, operating environment, application type, and application complexity. All these considerations significantly affect the mapping between functional size and S_{e}. After FBS is translated into function points, it is then converted into S_{e} as: S_{e} = Lx * (AdjFactor * UFP)^{\\\\frac{Entropy}{1.2}} where, * Lx is a language-dependent expansion factor. * AdjFactor is the outcome of calculations involving other factors mentioned above. Entropy ranges from 1.04 to 1.2 depending on the type of software being developed. Effort and Duration Calculations A project's effort and duration are interrelated, as is reflected in their calculation within the model. Effort drives duration, notwithstanding productivity-related feedback between duration constraints and effort. The basic effort equation is: K = D^{0.4}*(\\\\frac{S_{e}}{C_{te}})^{E} where, * S_{e} is effective size - introduced earlier * C_{te} is effective technology - a composite metric that captures factors relating to the efficiency or productivity with which development can be carried out. An extensive set of people, process, and product parameters feed into the effective technology rating. A higher rating means that development will be more productive * D is staffing complexity - a rating of the project's inherent difficulty in terms of the rate at which staff are added to a project. * E is the entropy - In days gone by entropy was fixed at 1.2. Next it evolved to 1.04 to 1.2 depending on project attributes with smaller IT oriented projects tending toward the lower. Currently entropy is observed as 1.0 to 1.2 depending on project attributes. SEER will allow an entropy less than 1.0 if such a circumstance is observed as well. Once effort is obtained, duration is solved using the following equation: t_{d} = D^{-0.2}*(\\\\frac{S_{e}}{C_{te}})^{0.4} The duration equation is derived from key formulaic relationships. Its 0.4 exponent indicates that as a project's size increases, duration also increases, though less than proportionally. This size-duration relationship is also used in component-level scheduling algorithms with task overlaps computed to fall within total estimated project duration.

It is located in the Zrenjanin municipal area, in the Banat region (Central Banat District), Vojvodina province. Its population is 2,034 (2002 census) and most of its inhabitants are ethnic Serbs (97.39%). Name Former Catholic church Resurrection of Jesus in Kniƒáanin (before Rudolfsgnad) from the year 1877 The village was named after voivod Stevan Kniƒáanin, who was the commander of the Serbian volunteer squads in the Serbian Vojvodina during the 1848/1849 revolution. Other names for the village used in Serbian were Kniƒáaninovo (–ö–Ω–∏—õ–∞–Ω–∏–Ω–æ–≤–æ) and Rudolfovo (–†—É–¥–æ–ª—Ñ–æ–≤–æ). The former German name of the village, Rudolfsgnad, was in use since 1868, when the village was named after Crown Prince Rudolf (1858-1889). The Hungarian version of the name derives from the German. Population Kniƒáanin has a Serb ethnic majority; ethnic Serbs number 1,981 inhabitants of the village. Other ethnic groups include Hungarians, Yugoslavs, Slovaks, Croats, and others. History The memorial at the edge of the old German graveyard, where the internees of the prison camp themselves buried those who died of \\"hunger, disease, and cold\\", according to the sign. The village was founded during Austrian administration (in 1866) by German (Danube Swabian) colonists, who mainly came from Eƒçka and Lukiƒáevo. Initially, it was part of the Banatian Military Frontier. After the abolishment of the frontier in 1873, the village was included into Toront√°l County, which was administratively a part of the Kingdom of Hungary within the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. In the 19th and the first half of the 20th century, the villagers were mainly farmers and artisans. According to the 1910 census, the village had German ethnic majority. In 1918, as part of the Banat, Baƒçka and Baranja region, the village firstly became part of the Kingdom of Serbia and then part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed to Yugoslavia). From 1918 to 1922 it was part of the Veliki Beƒçkerek county, from 1922 to 1929 part of the Belgrade oblast, and from 1929 to 1941 part of the Danube Banovina. In 1931, the population of the village numbered 3,072 inhabitants. During the Axis occupation of Yugoslavia from 1941 to 1944, the village was part of the German-administered Banat region that had special status within the Axis puppet state of Serbia. Before the end of the World War II, the population of the village was mainly composed of ethnic Germans (Danube Swabians). At the end of World War II, in 1944, one part of local Danube Swabian inhabitants left from the area, together with defeated German army. Those Danube Swabians who remained in the region had their citizenships and all civil rights revoked by the AVNOJ decrees of 1943 and 1944 issued by the Yugoslav communists and were sent to local communist prison camps. One of these camps was located in Kniƒáanin and internees in this camp mostly originated from central and southern Banat. The average number of people inside prison camp was 17,200, while the largest number was 20,500 and altogether there were about 33,000 prisoners. The camp operated from 10 October 1945 until middle of March 1948 (total operating time was 29 months or 880 days). According to some claims, number of internees who died in the camp might be about 13,000 (9,500 death cases were documented). Main causes of death were typhus, malaria, and malnutrition.V√∂lkermord der Tito-Partisanen 1944-1948, √ñsterreichische Historiker-Arbeitsgemeinschaft f√ºr K√§rnten und Steiermark, Graz, 1990, , p. 169ff.Leidensweg der Deutschen im kommunistischen Jugoslawien, Band 3, Donauschw√§bisches Archiv M√ºnchen, 1995, , S. 234ffStefanovic, Nenad, Ein Volk an der Donau, Donauschw√§bische Kulturstiftung, M√ºnchen, 1999, , S. 84ffSper, Darko: Vojvodina Germans Seek Moral and Cultural Rehabilitation After communist prison camps were dissolved in 1948 due to the pressure of the Red Cross and the Vatican,Donauschwaben hoffen auf Papst-Besuch bei Gr√§bern most of the remaining German population left Yugoslavia.

It was the last film to feature all five members of the Rat Pack, as Sinatra would no longer speak to or work with Lawford following the abrupt cancellation in March 1962 of a visit by Lawford's brother-in-law, President John F. Kennedy, to Sinatra's Palm Springs house. The film is a remake of Gunga Din (1939), with the setting moved from India to the American West. Plot Mike, Chip and Larry are three lusty, brawling U.S. Cavalry sergeants stationed in Indian Territory in 1870. Mike and Chip are determined to prevent Larry from carrying out his decision to leave the army at the end of his current hitch and marry the beautiful Amelia Parent. One night, the three friends befriend a trumpet-playing former slave, Jonah Williams (Davis), who dreams of someday becoming a trooper. A tribe of fanatical Indians begins terrorizing the area, and the headstrong Chip decides to attempt the capture of their leader. Accompanied by Jonah, he sneaks into the Indians' secret meeting place while they are conducting one of their mysterious rites, but he is discovered and taken prisoner. Jonah escapes and races back to tell Mike and Larry. When Larry insists upon going to Chip's rescue, Mike makes him sign a reenlistment paper \\"just to make his help official\\" and promises to destroy the paper after the mission. Mike, Larry and Jonah make their way to the Indian stronghold, but they too end up as prisoners. As the Cavalry rides into a trap where a thousand warriors are waiting to ambush them, Jonah blows the regiment's favorite tune on his trumpet as a warning. The ensuing battle ends in victory for the Cavalry; the three sergeants are decorated, and Jonah is made a trooper. Thinking himself discharged, Larry drives off in a buggy with Amelia, but the crafty Mike shows the post's commanding officer the reenlistment paper that he had promised to destroy. It appears that Larry will be forced to serve another hitch with Mike and Chip.

R. Burnett and produced by Frank Sinatra, the film is a remake of Gunga Din with Sinatra in the Victor McLaglen role, Martin in the Cary Grant part, Lawford replacing Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Davis in Sam Jaffe's role. Parts of the film were shot in Johnson Canyon, Paria, Kanab and Bryce Canyon in Utah. Filming also took place in House Rock Valley, Arizona. The Thugee cult is replaced by the Ghost Dancers, with Michael Pate and Henry Silva appearing as Indians. Burnett was also credited with writing a novelization of the film. Sinatra wanted to use the title Soldiers Three but couldn't get the rights, as the title was owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for another Gunga Din-inspired story set in India, Soldiers Three, a 1951 film based on Rudyard Kipling's story that starred David Niven, Walter Pidgeon and Stewart Granger. Rat Pack Each of the Rat Pack's films contained a numeral in its title. The others were: Ocean's 11 (1960), Robin and the 7 Hoods (1964, with Joey Bishop absent and Bing Crosby replacing Peter Lawford) and 4 for Texas with Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Anita Ekberg and Ursula Andress as the four in the title, Charles Bronson as a villain and the Three Stooges as additional comedy relief. Sinatra said of these Rat Pack films: \\"Of course they're not great movies, no one could claim that... but every movie I've made through my own company has made money.\\" The only Rat Pack film not produced by Sinatra was Ocean's 11, which earned $4.3 million in rentals at the North American box office and was ranked by Variety as the 14th highest-earning film of 1960. \\"The Lost Sinatra Film\\" The film had seldom been seen after its initial run in cinemas until a DVD was released on May 13, 2008, both as a single disc and as part of a new Rat Pack box set, to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Sinatra's death. Critical reception Sergeants 3 was met with middling reviews on release. Variety labeled it as \\"warmed-over Gunga Din in a westernized version of that epic, with American-style Indians and Vegas-style soldiers of fortune. The essential differences between the two pictures, other than the obvious one of setting, is that the emphasis in Gunga was serious with a tongue-in-cheek overtone, whereas the emphasis in Sergeants is tongue-in-cheek with serious overtones.\\" In a contemporary New York Times review, critic A. H. Weiler wrote: \\"Mr. Sinatra and his loyal coterie switch from slapstick to slaughter and back again with reckless abandon.

Route description =Queens= Myrtle Avenue has been a major thoroughfare since the early 19th century, named after the myrtle trees that were plentiful in the area. Most likely, Myrtle Avenue began in Queens and was a plank road that charged a toll. The road eventually hosted the Knickerbocker Stage Coach Line, that ran stagecoach and omnibus services. After World War I, Myrtle Avenue in Glendale was a popular destination for picnickers. With a steam trolley running on the avenue, and its ample adjacent beer gardens and park space, people from as far as Eastern Brooklyn came to Myrtle. In the mid-1920s, the parks closed as a result of Prohibition. Ultimately, the parks became incorporated by the city into what is known today as Forest Park. Currently, Myrtle Avenue is one of the primary shopping strips of Ridgewood, along with Fresh Pond Road whose south end is at Myrtle Avenue. It is also the primary shopping strip in nearby Glendale, although this stretch of Myrtle Avenue isn't as busy as the Ridgewood stretch. It was also home to the Ridgewood Theatre, which was the longest continuously operated theater in the United States, having operated for 91 years before its closure in March 2008. Myrtle Avenue is the starting point for several major thoroughfares in Queens that were built later. This includes Union Turnpike, whose west end is in Glendale just west of Woodhaven Boulevard, and Hillside Avenue, which starts off from Myrtle Avenue in Richmond Hill near Lefferts Boulevard. =Brooklyn= In the neighborhoods of Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, the development of Myrtle Avenue was directly related to the Brooklyn Navy Yard, built in 1801. In 1847 Fort Greene Park, Brooklyn's first park, was built on the south side of western Myrtle Avenue. During World War II, the Navy Yard employed more than 71,000 people, many of them African American shipbuilders. As a result, the demand for housing in the area increased, prompting the New York City Housing Authority to build the Walt Whitman and Raymond Ingersoll public housing on Myrtle Avenue in 1944. By the early 1970s the vitality of Myrtle Avenue began to decline, mainly because of the decommissioning of the Brooklyn Navy Yard and the curtailing of the elevated railway. At its nadir of decline, the street became known to many Brooklynites as \\"Murder Avenue\\". In the 1990s the western end of Myrtle Avenue was closed from Jay Street to Flatbush Avenue Extension to create the pedestrian-only MetroTech Center. Adding to the MetroTech Center's revitalization of the neighborhood, a modern revitalization movement is in effect by a collaboration of community organizations like the Myrtle Avenue Revitalization Project LDC (MARP), the Myrtle Avenue Brooklyn Improvement district BID, and the Myrtle Avenue Merchants Association. Some parts of Myrtle Avenue, for example around Pratt Institute, have become a main street of commerce with many trendy restaurants and boutique retail shops. Transportation The currently runs above Myrtle Avenue through Bushwick and a small stretch through Bedford-Stuyvesant. Formerly, the Myrtle Avenue El was an elevated railroad line that ran along Myrtle Avenue. The completed line ran from Middle Village to Downtown Brooklyn and Park Row, Manhattan, using the avenue for most of its route. Since 1969, the portion of the line west of the Myrtle Avenue ‚Äì Broadway station was demolished, while the rest of the line east of the Myrtle Avenue - Broadway station remains. Myrtle Avenue is currently served by the following subway stations, west to east: * Myrtle‚ÄìWilloughby Avenues () * Myrtle Avenue () * Central Avenue () * Knickerbocker Avenue () * Myrtle‚ÄìWyckoff Avenues; a station complex consisting of: ** Myrtle‚ÄìWyckoff Avenues () ** Myrtle‚ÄìWyckoff Avenues () Also, DeKalb Avenue () and 121st Street () are stations near the avenue. There is an abandoned subway station on the BMT Brighton Line directly under Myrtle Avenue; it was closed in 1957 due to a track reconfiguration north of DeKalb Avenue. Two bus routes primarily serve the avenue. The Queens stretch of Myrtle Avenue is served by the bus line. The Brooklyn stretch of Myrtle Avenue is served by the bus line. In addition, several bus routes serve the avenue at the Ridgewood Intermodal Terminal near Myrtle‚ÄìWyckoff Avenues subway station. In popular culture There are references to Myrtle Avenue in hip-hop culture and rap music, reflective of the street passing through African American neighborhoods in Brooklyn. The popularity of the nickname \\"Murder Avenue\\" dates back to the minor 1993 hit of the same name by the Geto Boys. Other artists that mention Myrtle Avenue include: * Nas refers to Willoughby and Myrtle Ave in the song \\"Virgo\\" with Ludacris and Doug E. Fresh. * Prodigy from Mobb Deep references Myrtle in \\"Trife Life\\" on The Infamous album. * Mos Def says he's from Myrtle and Broadway in the song \\"Champion Requiem\\" on The New Danger, and in the song \\"Mathematics\\" on Black on Both Sides. * Talib Kweli references the street in the Black Eyed Peas' song \\"Like That\\" - \\"Like a caribou running down myrtle avenue\\". * Digable Planets reference the avenue in the song \\"9th Wonder (Blackitolism)\\" when Butterfly rhymes - \\"Myrtle Ave A Train got the pick in my hair\\". * Prince Paul references Myrtle Avenue in his song \\"People, Places & Things\\". * Lord Jamar refers to Myrtle Avenue in the Brand Nubian song \\"Straight Off Tha Head\\" * Henry Miller in Tropic of Capricorn wrote about the horrible conditions of Myrtle Avenue. *Tory Lanez references Myrtle Ave as the birthplace of a character in his song \\"Pieces\\" from his album Memories Don't Die. *Floating Points references Myrtle Avenue, Hounslow is his song ‚ÄúMyrtle Avenue‚Äù *Mxmtoon released a song in 2020 entitled \\"Myrtle Ave\\" References External links * Brooklyn Bites: Neighborhood Dining Guide for Myrtle Avenue in GO Brooklyn * Robert Gerhard.

The film is about a French town where a number of citizens receive anonymous letters containing libelous information, particularly targeting a doctor accused of being an abortionist. The mystery surrounding the letters eventually escalates into violence. The film caused serious problems for its director after World War II as it had been produced by Continental Films, a German production company established near the beginning of the Occupation of France, and because the film had been perceived by the underground and the Communist press as vilifying the French people. Because of this, Clouzot was initially banned for life from directing in France, but after protests only until 1947. The film was suppressed until 1969. It was remade as The 13th Letter (1951) by Otto Preminger. Plot In a small French town identified as \\"anywhere\\", anonymous poison pen letters are sent by somebody signing as \\"Le Corbeau\\" (the Raven). The letters start by accusing doctor R√©my Germain of having an affair with Laura Vorzet, the pretty young wife of the elderly psychiatrist Dr. Vorzet. Germain is also accused of practising illegal abortions. Letters are then sent to virtually all the population of the town, but keep getting back to the initial victim, Dr. Germain. The situation becomes increasingly serious when a patient of the hospital commits suicide with his straight razor after the Raven writes to him that his cancer is terminal. Laura Vorzet's sister Marie Corbin, a nurse in the infirmary, becomes a suspect and is arrested, but soon new letters arrive. When one letter is dropped in a church from a gallery, it becomes apparent the Raven must be one of the people seated there at the time. They are gathered to re-write the Raven's letters as dictated by Dr. Vorzet, to compare the handwriting. Germain's lover Denise is suspected when she faints during the dictation, only for Laura to be identified by material found on her blotter. Germain agrees to sign an order committing Laura as insane; he is called away to attend Denise, who has fallen downstairs, but before he leaves Laura protests she wrote the Raven's first letters before Dr. Vorzet began dictating them, making him the true Raven. Just as the ambulance takes Laura away, Germain returns to find Dr. Vorzet dead at his desk, his throat cut by the cancer patient's mother as he was writing the Raven's final, triumphant letter. Cast Production The film is loosely based on an anonymous letter case that had begun in the town of Tulle, Limousin, in 1917. Anonymous letters had been sent by somebody signing \\"the eye of the tiger\\". The first version of the screenplay was written by Louis Chavance shortly after the Tulle letters, years before it was finally produced.Henri Jeanson, \\"The Return of Clouzot's Le Corbeau or The Commies vs. Le Corbeau,\\" L'Intransigeant, 10 September 1947. The film credits Clouzot for adapting the story himself, and both Clouzot and Chavance for writing the dialogue. Le Corbeau was produced by Continental Films, which aside from being a German company established during Occupation, was known for making detective films \\"with a light, even comic tone\\" and often featuring Pierre Fresnay,Alan Williams, \\"Le Corbeau,\\" The Criterion Collection, 16 February 2004, URL accessed 21 June 2016. who played Germain in this film. Clouzot previously worked with Fresnay on another Continental Films project, The Murderer Lives at Number 21 (1942). Writer Joseph Kessel later criticised the film's Continental origins, noting Le Corbeau was funded by the Germans, and in that context could be seen as a statement on French corruption. Kessel questioned if the film would be made if it were set in Germany.Joseph Kessel, \\"The Corbeau Affair (continued),\\" L'Intransigeant, 27 September 1947. It was shot at the Billancourt Studios in Paris with location filming around Montfort-l'Amaury. The film's sets were designed by the art director Andrej Andrejew. Release Le Corbeau was released in France on September 28, 1943. Although after the war Le Corbeau was banned and leftists supported keeping the ban in place, the film was screened in cineclubs throughout France and often drew thousands of moviegoers. The film was released on DVD by The Criterion Collection. This DVD is out of print. Reception In 1947, the film was released commercially, with writer Henri Jeanson praising it as a major piece in French cinema, arguing it was repulsive, but, when compared to reality, became nearly romantic. Despite criticising its origins, Joseph Kessel, writing in response to Jeanson, said that Le Corbeau was indisputably a remarkable film. Writing in 2004, Professor Alan Williams judged Le Corbeau to be \\"the first classic French film noir\\", though made before the term film noir was coined. He found low-key humour in the screenplay and also argued it posed \\"a properly philosophical debate about the effects of the German occupation\\", comparing the atmosphere created by the Raven's letters to that under Occupation. One notable legacy of the film was to make \\"crow\\" a term for a malicious informant.

Description These laws were directed against, and identified by name, particularly influential (i.e. aristocratic) families and Ghibelline sympathizers. Those identified were supposed to possess a bellicose and ungovernable nature. Primarily these people were barred from holding office and, if they committed certain crimes their punishment could be doubled. In later years the severity of the Ordinances of Justice were somewhat mitigated but they stayed in force. These ordinances ensured that the guilds of Florence retained control of the city.

This infestation seriously compromised the already-depleted food supply of the region and sharpened the misery of all Jerusalemites. Historian Zachary J. Foster argues that the scale of the attack was far worse than anything Syria had witnessed in many decades. He suggested further that a huge percentage of the region's major foodstuffs and sources of livelihood, including fruits, vegetables, legumes, fodder and a small but not insignificant amount of the cereals, were devoured by the locusts. \\"The attack diminished the 1915 winter harvest (wheat and barley) by 10‚Äì15 per cent\\", he noted, \\"and completely wrecked the 1915 summer and autumn harvests (fruits and vegetables), in ranges varying from 60 to 100 per cent, depending on the crop\\". The crop destruction resulted in several increases to the price of food. On 25 April 1915, The New York Times described the price increases. \\"Flour costs $15 a sack. Potatoes are six times the ordinary price. Sugar and petroleum are unprocurable and money has ceased to circulate.\\" Among the consequences of the event was the Great Famine of Mount Lebanon, which led to the deaths of nearly one half of Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate inhabitants from hunger and disease between 1915 and 1918. Reaction Djemal Pasha, who was the Supreme Commander of Syria and Arabia at the time of the locust infestation, launched a campaign to limit the devastation of the incident. He appointed an official to fight the infestation. Many people believed that prayer and petition were required to end the plague, as they viewed the swarm of locusts as a punishment from God for their sins. Rav A.M. Luntz, who observed the development of the infestation said that the \\"Badatz decreed that on the following day there should be a Taanit Tzibbur and the whole day should be one of selichot, prayer and petition. After a few days the locusts left the Land\\", as locusts do after they have finished feeding. However, in the amount of time they nested there, the locusts replenished themselves with new larvae. Regulations A portable flamethrower being prepared to destroy locusts in Palestine, 1915 Midhat Bey, who was the official appointed to fight the infestation, helped enact a law which required every male between ages 15 and 60 in cities to collect 20 kilograms of locust eggs or pay a fine of ¬£4.40. The New York Times reported that this law was strictly enforced. They said that people who failed to follow the law risked having their businesses closed. 800 had paid the fine by 21 November 1915. Aftermath The Great Famine of Mount Lebanon (1915‚Äì1918) was a period of mass starvation during World War I. The Allies' blockade was made worse by another introduced by Djemal Pasha, the commander of the Fourth Army of the Ottoman Empire in Syria region, where crops were barred from entering from the neighboring Syrian hinterland to Mount Lebanon, and by the arrival of a swarm of locusts to the region in 1915 that, for three continuous months, devoured the remaining crops. The famine was caused by a convergence of political and environmental factors that lead to the death of half of the population of Mount Lebanon Mutasarrifate, a semi-autonomous subdivision of the Ottoman Empire and the precursor of modern-day Lebanon.

Haddad = * For other translations of the Ashtiname, including the lists of witnesses, refer to The Covenants of the Prophet Muhammad with the Christians of the World (Angelico Press / Sophia Perennis, 2013) by Dr. John Andrew Morrow. History According to the monks' tradition, Muhammad frequented the monastery and had great relationships and discussions with the Sinai fathers. Several certified historical copies are displayed in the library of St Catherine, some of which are witnessed by the judges of Islam to affirm historical authenticity. The monks claim that during the Ottoman conquest of Egypt in the Ottoman‚ÄìMamluk War (1516‚Äì17), the original document was seized from the monastery by Ottoman soldiers and taken to Sultan Selim I's palace in Istanbul for safekeeping.Lafontaine-Dosogne, \\"Le Monast√®re du Sina√Ø: creuset de culture chr√©tiene (Xe-XIIIe si√®cle)\\", p. 105. A copy was then made to compensate for its loss at the monastery. It also seems that the charter was renewed under the new rulers, as other documents in the archive suggest.Atiya, \\"The Monastery of St. Catherine and the Mount Sinai Expedition\\". p. 578. Traditions about the tolerance shown towards the monastery were reported in governmental documents issued in Cairo and during the period of Ottoman rule (1517‚Äì1798), the Pasha of Egypt annually reaffirmed its protections. In 1916, Na'um Shuqayr published the Arabic text of the Ashtiname in his Tarikh Sina al-qadim or History of Ancient Sinai. The Arabic text, along with its German translation, was published for a second time in 1918 in Bernhard Moritz's Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte des Sinai-Klosters. The Testamentum et pactiones inter Mohammedem et Christianae fidei cultores, which was published in Arabic and Latin by Gabriel Sionita in 1630 represents a covenant concluded between the Prophet Muhammad and the Christians of the World. It is not a copy of the Ashtiname. The origins of the Ashtiname has been the subject of a number of different traditions, best known through the accounts of European travellers who visited the monastery. These authors include the French knight Greffin Affagart (d. c. 1557), the French traveller Jean de Th√©venot (d. 1667) and the English prelate Richard Peacocke, who included an English translation of the text. Authenticity Since the 19th century, several aspects of the Ashtiname, notably the list of witnesses, have been questioned by scholars.Ratliff, \\"The monastery of Saint Catherine at Mount Sinai and the Christian communities of the Caliphate\\", note 9. Ratliff refers to Mouton, \\"Les musulmans √† Sainte-Catherine au Moyen √Çge\\", p. 177. There are similarities to other documents granted to other religious communities in the Near East. One example is Muhammad's alleged letter to the Christians of Najran, which first came to light in 878 in a monastery in Iraq and whose text is preserved in the Chronicle of Seert. At the beginning of the 20th century, Bernhard Moritz, in his seminal work, concluded from his analysis of the document, that: \\"The impossibility of finding this document to be authentic is clearly evident. The date, style and content all prove the inauthenticity.\\"Moritz, Bernhard. (1918). \\"Beitr√§ge zur Geschichte des Sinaiklosters im Mittelalter nach arabischen Quellen\\", p. 11. Amidu Sanni points out that there are no existent codices, Islamic or otherwise, which predate the 16th century,Sanni.

The Covenants of the Prophet Muhammad with the Christians of the World\\", Islamic Studies, Vol. 57 No. 3-4 (2018), p. 313 Modern influence Some have argued that the Ashtiname is a resource for building bridges between Muslims and Christians. For example, in 2009, in the pages of The Washington Post, Muqtedar Khan translated the document in full, arguing that The Ashtiname is the inspiration for The Covenants Initiative which urges all Muslims to abide by the treaties and covenants that were concluded by Muhammad with the Christian communities of his time. In 2018, the final legal judgement in the Pakistani Asia Bibi blasphemy case cited the covenant and said that one of Noreen's accusers violated the Ashtiname of Muhammad, a \\"covenant made by Muhammad with Christians in the seventh century but still valid today\\". On February 10, 2019, Prime Minister of Pakistan, Imran Khan cited the covenant in his speech delivered at World Government Summit, 2019.

The main fa√ßade hints at features of the elevation of the older wooden cathedral just visible behind it Interior of Holy Trinity Cathedral: chancel viewed from the nave Holy Trinity Cathedral is an Anglican place of worship situated in Parnell, a residential suburb of Auckland, New Zealand. It is the mother church of the Anglican Diocese of Auckland and the cathedral of the Bishop of Auckland. The current main church was consecrated in 1973. History The first Anglican place of worship in Auckland was Old St Paul's, at the bottom of Princes Street, but Parnell residents tired of walking about over paddocks to reach their church. The first church serving the district was dedicated to St Barnabas. Completed in 1849 it was situated near the bottom of Parnell on land which was later demolished and used for reclamation work. This small church of St Barnabas slowly fell into disuse following completion of Old St Mary's church in 1860, and was eventually shifted to Mount Eden, where it still forms part of the Parish Church. With the building of the original St Mary's Church, Bishop Selwyn established the Parish of St Mary. Old St Mary's stood on the site of the present cathedral, but proved to be too small, badly ventilated and uncomfortable. The establishment of New Zealand's dioceses, and Auckland's fast growing population, meant that a larger church was required. Old St Mary's Church was demolished and in 1886 work started on land opposite to build a new Cathedral Church of St Mary. This wooden Gothic Revival church was designed by the prominent New Zealand architect Benjamin Mountfort and completed in 1897. The building served as the Cathedral Church and principal Anglican church of Auckland until 1973 when the Chancel of Holy Trinity Cathedral, for which the foundation stone was laid in 1957, came into use. In 1982, St Mary's Church was moved across Parnell Road to its present site beside the cathedral. Diocese and Cathedral Mountfort's earlier wooden cathedral of 1886. The terminating gables served as an inspiration to the fa√ßade of the Cathedral Nave (illustrated above) Today the Diocese of Auckland is one of seven dioceses of the Tikanga Pakeha (pakeha culture) stream of the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia. The Diocese covers the area stretching from North Cape south to the Waikato River, across the Hauraki Plains and including the Coromandel Peninsula. The Anglican church in New Zealand, today known as the Anglican Church in Aotearoa, New Zealand and Polynesia, was pioneered by Bishop George Selwyn who arrived as Bishop of New Zealand in 1841. The interior of St Mary's Cathedral, Auckland In those early days the then colony was regarded as one huge diocese which, including large areas of the South Pacific, covered almost one sixth of the Earth's surface. Selwyn did much to establish the church and many small chapels, churches, schools and a theological college were built during this period. In 1856 Selwyn created New Zealand's first diocese, Christchurch. Following the adoption of the Constitution of the Church of the Province of New Zealand, which was signed in St Stephen's Chapel, Judges Bay, Auckland, on 13 June 1857, other dioceses were soon established: Nelson and Waiapu in 1858, and Wellington in 1859. Following the creation of the dioceses Selwyn became ipso facto the Bishop of Auckland (though never formally styled as such), while retaining the Primacy and continuing as the Metropolitan. In diaries kept by his contemporary, Attorney-General William Swainson, Auckland was at that time expected to be the permanent seat of the Metropolitan of New Zealand. St Stephen's Chapel, Auckland In 1843 Selwyn purchased land in Parnell for the cathedral, as well as for St Stephen's Chapel, Bishopscourt, and associated buildings. He wrote in his diary on 3 June 1843 \\". . I reached the Judge's House [Judge Martin; First Attorney-General] by a path, avoiding the town, and passed over land which I have bought for the site of the Cathedral . . . \\". He is reputed to have included the intended name for the cathedral in a sermon at Lichfield Cathedral in 1841 after his consecration. Selwyn returned to England in 1868 having selected William Cowie as his successor. Cowie was the first Bishop to be known as Bishop of Auckland, and it may be considered that this was the year of the formation of the Diocese of Auckland, though it is generally said to be 1841. The Diocese of Dunedin, formerly part of the Christchurch Diocese, was created in 1869. During Bishop Cowie's 33-year tenure, the last nine as Primate, the Diocesan administration was set up in the traditional Anglican understanding of the term. When the dioceses were firmly established, each with its bishop, the building of New Zealand's cathedrals began. ChristChurch Cathedral was one of the first: begun in 1864, it was finally consecrated in 1881. It had been intended to build a cathedral seating 1000 people in Auckland but by 1883 the plan was abandoned because of cost. Instead, a decision was made to replace the existing small church of St. Mary's in Parnell with a larger church and in 1884 work began. The new church was designated a cathedral in 1887 while uncompleted, and a Cathedral Chapter of clerical canons and lay members was formed in 1893 while the new cathedral was in use but still awaiting completion. By 1926 the Auckland diocese was very large and becoming densely populated, so The Most Revd A. W. Averill, Bishop of Auckland and Archbishop of New Zealand, divided off the southern regions of Waikato, King Country and Taranaki to form the Diocese of Waikato. The Auckland cathedral used to be square, and they wanted to make it into a cross shape, but no one could work out how to design it to be safe. Later on an English carpenter, who had lived in New Zealand for a couple of years worked out how to. Apparently he was a fantastic artist, and his name was George Day. Buildings  =St Mary's Church= tribune of St Mary's Cathedral, Auckland is reminiscent of a Romanesque European cathedral St Mary's Church is the former cathedral church of the Anglican Diocese of Auckland. It replaced the earlier Old St Mary's. This wooden Gothic Revival church was designed by the prominent Christchurch architect Benjamin Mountfort and completed in 1897. The building served as the Cathedral Church and principal Anglican church of Auckland until 1973 when the Chancel of Holy Trinity Cathedral, for which the foundation stone was laid in 1957, came into use. In 1982, St Mary's Church was moved across Parnell Road to its present site beside the cathedral. =Cathedral of the Holy Trinity= Flags of the Diocese of Auckland and the Holy Trinity Cathedral, Auckland The Nave of the new Cathedral dedicated to \\"The Holy Trinity\\" was designed by N.Z. Architect Professor Richard Toy. Building commenced in 1961 and was completed in 1965. Professor Toy designed a modern Nave while retaining the ambience and architectural values of the older Chancel. He combined two very different architectural styles, incorporating the existing brick & reinforced concrete neo-Gothic Chancel, with the new Nave, a contemporary design which has large areas of glass and a timber ceiling. The line of the Nave roof reflects that of St Mary's Church which stands beside it. The Nave is square in plan enabling the space to be used not only as a place of worship but also as a site for local community functions. Glass doors the length of two sides light the vast space, and accentuate the seemingly unsupported roof with its absence of visible structural support. This surreal effect is made possible by a ridge and furrow roof system, a refinement of that first invented by the architect Joseph Paxton for his Crystal Palace in 1852. The vast uncluttered space and fine acoustics realised by this ingenious construction allow multi-purpose use of the nave, including concerts and other performances. A third area of worship ‚Äì the Marsden Chapel named after Samuel Marsden, separated from the body of the cathedral by glass doors and panels ‚Äì provides an intimate space for private devotions. The inspiration for this small chapel was the small medieval churches of Europe. The decoration in this part of the cathedral is very simple in direct contrast to the rest of the building. A set of five stained glass windows designed by prominent English artist John Baker fit perfectly into the chapel. West window of the Cathedral The cathedral is renowned for its modern stained glass, including the unique window featuring a Polynesian Christ with vividly coloured Pacific motifs. A set of eighteen windows along the sides of the Nave, designed by Robert Ellis and Shane Cotton and dedicated in 2004, tell the Christian story using a combination of traditional and Polynesian designs. The overall design of the cathedral has been described as the world's only example of the \\"Pacific Gothic\\" style. The supervising architect for the building of the nave was John Sinclair, former president of the New Zealand Institute of Architects, who also designed the Monteith Visitors' Centre which is attached to the north-east corner of the cathedral and forms an eastern boundary to the Cathedral Forecourt. The cathedral can accommodate 1250 people, the nave having a maximum seating capacity of 1100. The church is maintained by the Diocese of Auckland and parishioners. They are assisted by the Friends of Holy Trinity Cathedral Parnell, an organisation particularly involved in the maintenance and beautification of the cathedral's fabric. The organisation was established in 1986. At a service on 28 October 2017 the cathedral was consecrated by Bishop Ross Bay. The service was attended by bishops of New Zealand, Aotearoa, Australia, Melanesia, Polynesia and Lichfield and a congregation of around 1400. Bishop Selwyn Chapel The Bishop Selwyn Chapel was designed in 2017 by the Fearon Hay Architects. It is in the Religious section of the World Architecture Festival in Berlin. At the back of the cathedral property it serves as a church for the un-choral eucharists.

The air was contained in 23 tanks holding air at 12.5 bar (1.25 MPa, 180 psi), taking up a huge amount of space (153 m¬≥/5,403 ft¬≥), and requiring the submarine to be of unprecedented size. The engine had a power of 60 kW (80 hp), and could propel the submarine for 5 nmi (9 km), at a speed of 4 kn (7.2 km/h). Compressed air was also used to empty its ballast tanks, which had a volume of 53 m¬≥ (1,872 ft¬≥). Ballast was 212 t (234 tons), including a security ballast of 34 t (37 tons).

The submarine was commanded by Lieutenant de Vaisseau Marie-Joseph-Camille Dor√©, native of La Rochelle. On 6 October 1863, Plongeur made her first trials by sailing down the Charente river, towards the harbour of the Cabane Carr√©e. On 2 November 1863, Plongeur was towed towards Port de Barques where her first underwater trials were planned. Because of poor weather conditions, the submarine was eventually towed to La Pallice and then to the harbour of La Rochelle (Bassin √† flot). On 14 February 1864, during trials in the Bassin √† flot, the engine raced due to an excessive admission of compressed air, and the submarine bumped into the quay. Trials were stopped. On 18 February 1864, Plongeur was towed to La Pallice and dived to 9 m (30 ft). Stability problems due to its length limited the submarine to dives to a maximum depth of 10 m (33 ft). The front of the submarine would tend to dive first, hitting the bottom, so that the submarine would glide forward. Pumps were installed to compensate for the tilt, but proved too slow to be effective. The installation of longitudinal rudders would have improved stability as later demonstrated by the Gymnote and Gustave Z√©d√© submarines.

The tepoztopilli was a common front-line weapon of the Aztec military. The tepoztopilli was a pole-arm, and to judge from depictions in various Aztec codices it was roughly the height of a man, although historian John Pohl indicates that the weapon used between the 12th and 14th century was made in sizes from 3 feet to 7 feet in length. The wedge-shaped wooden head, about twice the length of the users' palm or shorter, was edged with razor-sharp obsidian blades which were deeply set in grooves carved into the head. They were cemented in place with bitumen or plant resin as an adhesive. This made the tepoztopilli vaguely similar to the macuahuitl or \\"macana\\", however it had a much smaller cutting edge and a longer handle. The greater length gave the weapon a superior reach, allowing the user to stand behind a line of more experienced warriors and then \\"shove or jab the weapon\\" into an adversary. Halfway between a halberd and a spear, the tepoztopilli was equally useful for slashing and thrusting. Conquistador Bernal D√≠az del Castillo mentions that on one occasion his armour was pierced by an Aztec lance and that only his thick cotton underpadding saved his life.

It won the Kinema Junpo Award for best film. Plot The film starts with a travelling kabuki troupe arriving by train at a provincial seaside town. Kihachi Ichikawa (Takeshi Sakamoto), the head of the troupe, is a very popular actor. He takes time off to visit a former mistress Otsune (Chouko Iida), with whom he had a son years before. His son, now a student, does not know that Kihachi is his father, thinking him an uncle. Kihachi and his son, Shinkichi, spend a fruitful afternoon fishing for dace in a nearby river. When the troupe's performance tour is postponed by the constant downpour around the region, one of the members of the troupe unwittingly reveals a secret: that Kihachi is seeing a woman every day. Otaka (Rieko Yagumo), one of Kihachi‚Äôs actresses and his present mistress, decides to pay a visit to Otsune's watering-hole with fellow actress Otoki (Yoshiko Tsubouchi). Kihachi becomes enraged, warns Otaka never to come and harass the mother and son again, and breaks off his relationship with her. To get back at Otsune and Kihachi, Otaka suggests to Otoki to try to seduce Shinkichi and offers her some money. Otoki waits for Shinkichi at a tree by the road one day and offers to meet after her performance at the same place. Shinkichi agrees to the meeting, and the two start a clandestine love affair. As time goes by, Otoki realizes she has fallen for Shinkichi. She tells Shinkichi to forget her because she is merely a traveling actress. Kihachi discovers their affair, confronts Otoki and slaps her, demanding to know what she wants. Otoki reveals Otaka's setup, but tells him she now loves Shinkichi and is not doing this for money. Kihachi then beats up Otaka, but realizes he no longer has any control over the affair. Kihachi decides to disband the troupe, selling all their costumes and props. The kabuki actors have one last night together. Kihachi visits Otsune, and tells her of his troupe's break-up. She invites him to stay with her for good, and they decide to tell Shinkichi of his paternity secret. Shinkichi and Otoki return, but Shinkichi and Kihachi get into a violent quarrel when Kihachi hits Otoki repeatedly. Otsune now tells Shinkichi that Kihachi is his father, but Shinkichi refuses to acknowledge him for abandoning them. Otsune reasons that Kihachi doesn't want Shinkichi to become a traveling actor like him. Shinkichi leaves for his room in a huff. Kihachi decides to restart another troupe, realizing he cannot stay. Otoki asks to join him, but Kihachi leaves her in Otsune's care and asks Otoki to help his son be a great man. Shinkichi comes down to look for his father but he has gone on the road. At the railway station, Kihachi meets Otaka who helps light his cigarette with matches. He invites her to start a new traveling troupe with him at Kamisuwa. Otaka goes to buy an extra ticket to accompany him. The film ends with a shot of a train traveling toward Kamisuwa. Themes The film includes the first appearance of what became one of the director's trademarks: a title sequence in which the credits appear against a sackcloth backdrop. Not only does this fit the story's pastoral setting, but since the credit sequences of Ozu's previous films had featured cartoony illustrations, the choice of humble sackcloth indicates the emergence of his mature film-making style.

The house was constructed prior to 1836, and was used as headquarters by both Union and Confederate forces, alternately, during the Civil War. In 1862, before being occupied by Federal forces, the plans for the Battle of Shiloh were laid out within this building. Because of this, the house was spared when the city was burned, leaving only three other buildings standing in the city. The official records, most of which are now housed at Tulane University, indicate that General Johnston's headquarters during the time he reorganized his Confederate forces in Decatur in March 1862 were at the McCarty (sic) Hotel. They also indicate that planning for attacking Grant's forces at Pittsburg Landing (the Battle of Shiloh) was done by Johnston's subordinate, General Beauregard, in Corinth, Mississippi. The list of major buildings in Decatur, Alabama that survived the Civil War were the Dancy-Polk House, the Old State Bank, The McCartney Hotel (demolished in the 1920s), and the Burleson House that later became known as the McEntire House. The most likely reason they were spared is that they were all inside the perimeter of the breastworks built by the Union in 1864. Everything outside the breastworks for an radius was leveled to provide a clear field of fire for the artillery defending the Union position on the banks of the Tennessee River. The Burlesons owned the house during the Civil War. Dr. Aaron Adair Burleson served as the president of the Tennessee and Central Alabama Railroad that later became part of the Nashville and Decatur Railroad. During the Civil War Dr. Burleson was a physician in the Confederate Army. The home was sold to Jerome Hinds, a former Union soldier from Illinois, in 1869. After the Hinds, the home was used as a boarding house and hotel before standing empty for a period. It was purchased on April 5, 1895 by R. P. McEntire. The house was also used as the second temporary courthouse, during the construction of the first permanent courthouse in Decatur, in Morgan County. The house was documented with large-format photographs by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1937.

In December 1966, the northern half of Estero Bay was designated as the state's first aquatic preserve, the Estero Bay Preserve State Park. The southern half of the bay was added to the preserve during the 1983 Florida Legislature session. In 2020, archeologists confirmed that Mound Key was the site of Fort San Ant√≥n de Carlos.

Synopsis An ex- prostitute, Mamma Roma (Anna Magnani), tries to start a new life selling vegetables with her 16-year-old son Ettore. When Ettore later finds out that she was a prostitute, he succumbs to his dark side and stops doing his duties. He later carries out a petty theft of a radio in a hospital and goes to prison. Meanwhile, until his incarceration, Mamma Roma struggles to raise her son the best way possible and build a new life for both. Cast * Anna Magnani as Mamma Roma * Ettore Garofolo as Ettore * Franco Citti as Carmine * Silvana Corsini as Bruna * Luisa Loiano as Biancofiore * Paolo Volponi as Priest * Luciano Gonini as Zacaria Production The lingering shots of Ettore, strapped to a prison bed in his underwear are seductive and haunting, as are shots of Mamma Roma walking at night, joined by different men in conversation, one after another in one continuous shot. Pier Paolo Pasolini said that he wasn't able to rebirth Anna Magnani as she was in Roma, citt√† aperta because, as an actor, she chose to maintain her independence from his artistic visions. \\"If I had to shoot the film over, I would have still chosen her\\", said Pasolini later. Pasolini vs. Rossellini Mamma Roma was dedicated to the director of Roma, citt√† aperta (1945), Roberto Rossellini. Anna Magnani plays a pregnant woman who is killed in the middle of Rossellini's film. Rossellini represents \\"good Italians\\" through the deaths of a priest, Don Pietro, who helps a communist group and a mother who tries to help her communist husband. People who killed these \\"good Italians\\" are Nazis. On the other hand, Pasolini comments on how the country changed from 1945 to 1962 in Mamma Roma. First of all, characters in the film are whores, pimps, and thieves. None of them are people who work for people. Secondly, in the beginning of the film, Mamma Roma brings three piglets to the wedding of her old pimp, Carmine. Carmine calls them \\"Brothers of Italy\\". Then, Mamma Roma calls one of them a slut. Contrasting with Rossellini's patriotic film, Pasolini brings irony into his film. Ettore dies in an Italian prison even though he does not die from extreme physical torture. Pasolini shows that the corruption of society is not because of outside forces like Rome under Nazi occupation. The problems are actually created within the society or the people in it. There is a shot of the landscape of Rome in the end of Mamma Roma. The dome of a church (Basilica di San Giovanni Bosco) sticks out from the rest of the tops of buildings. The scene shares a similarity with the aforementioned Rossellini's film again. In Rossellini's film, the dome of St. Peter's appears as the background when boys are walking on the street dragging their sadness. They seem like they are walking toward St. Peter's or \\"the house of God\\". On the other hand, in Pasolini's film, when Mamma Roma learns of Ettore's death, she goes back to her apartment and tries to jump out of the window. She sees the dome of a church and stares at the dome. The image of her and the dome switches back and forth. Her stare gets more intense. The film ends. Pasolini vs. neo-realist films What separates Pasolini from other neo- realist filmmakers is the use of actors and their acting. Most of Pasolini's cast didn't have any acting training. In his book A Certain Realism: Making Use of Pasolini's Film Theory and Practice, Maurizio Viano points out that actors in other filmmaker's films are \\"beginners\\" and they start establishing acting careers afterwards. But in Pasolini's case, most of the actors \\"only acted with Pasolini\\". So, actors who have worked with Pasolini don't develop a career in acting because Pasolini's film is the first and the last film of their acting career. Author of Pier Paolo Pasolini: Cinema as Heresy, Naomi Greene says the use of non-professional actors is the same as what other neo- realist filmmakers do, but the philosophy behind it is different. Neo-realist filmmakers believed that using nonprofessional actors \\"would add to the realism to their films, Pasolini turned to nonprofessionals because their acting did not seem 'real'\\". Nonprofessional acting obviously interrupts \\"narrative flow\\". For example, when Mamma Roma and Ettore dance a tango together, Ettore's rigid inexpert dance move causes his mother to fall on the floor. She laughs brightly. Ettore laughs shyly and looks at the camera. But Pasolini does not cut or reshoot the scene. He leaves it as it is.  Style and themes: Pasolini's obsession and techniques in Mamma Roma =Christian art= Pasolini's obsession with Christian art can be seen in Mamma Roma. In the scene of Carmine's wedding, Pasolini recreates the Last Supper by Leonardo da Vinci. There is a long flat table at which newlyweds are sitting and a white wall behind them. When Ettore dies in a prison hospital, Pasolini recreates Mantegna's Lamentation over the Dead Christ. Ettore is lying on the wooden bed. He is stripped down to an undershirt and underpants. His body is tied to the bed. The light coming from the ceiling emphasizes Ettore's pale skin. The camera shoots his body from Ettore's feet, similar to the Mantegna painting. =Invisibility as \\"sacred\\"= Pasolini often uses the word \\"sacred\\" to describe the images he creates or the images that he excludes from the frame. In the film, there are two long takes, and both of them are when Mamma Roma walks at night, working as a prostitute. The background is dark. Only lined street lights are dimly shining. The audience can't see what is going on in the background. Mamma Roma seems isolated from the world. Greene explains what this cinematography technique creates in Pasolini's film. \\"By fixing and isolating segments of what is visible, Pasolini creates the sense that what we see is merely one part of reality, and that the truly essential ‚Äî and sacred ‚Äî remains unseen.\\" Just as people can't see God, Pasolini is attracted by something that is invisible to the audience's eye, and the invisible images carry something mysterious. In this scene of Mamma Roma, the invisible background makes the scene more mysterious and outstanding than other scenes in the film. =Direct body language= Pasolini uses physical language to show an emotional or psychological state of Ettore. Ettore walks abnormally as if he is \\"sleepwalking\\". Viano suggests that \\"Pasolini has Ettore 'sleepwalking' throughout the film because 'sleepwalking' is the best visual translation of a state of nonparticipation in normal, waking life\\". Ettore's physical state fits with his psychological state. He starts having a fever in the end of the film. He gets excluded from his friends and becomes lonely. His \\"abnormal body temperature\\" shows abnormality or difference between him and other people and his strong loneliness and wanting to belong and to have somebody to trust. Reception =Public reaction= As soon as the film was released, critics and audiences claimed the film as immoral due to swearing. The issue was brought to court, but the case was turned down as unfounded. At the film's premiere in the Quattro Fontane Cinema in Rome on 22 September 1962, Pasolini was attacked by fascists who protested against the film. =Critical= The film is considered by some film critics as a visual evidence on the hardships of the people who struggled to live after the Italian Fascist era.

The screenplay was written by Renoir, Jack Kirkland, Renzo Avanzo and Giulio Macchi, and is based on the 1829 play Le Carrosse du Saint-Sacrement (The Coach of the Blessed Sacrament), by Prosper M√©rim√©e. It stars Anna Magnani, Odoardo Spadaro and Duncan Lamont. Plot The Viceroy of a remote 18th-century Peruvian town has purchased a magnificent golden coach from Europe. The Viceroy hints of his intention to give the coach to his mistress, the Marquise, but has decided to pay for it with public funds, since he plans to use it to overawe the populace and flatter the local nobility, who enthusiastically look forward to taking turns parading in it. By coincidence, the coach arrives on the same ship that carries an Italian commedia dell'arte troupe composed of men, women and children who perform as singers, actors, acrobats and comics. The troupe is led by Don Antonio, who also portrays the stock character of Pantalone on stage, and features Camilla, who plays the stock role of Columbina. Once members of the troupe refurbish the town's dilapidated theater, their performances meet with success only after local hero, Ramon, a toreador, becomes smitten with Camilla and starts leading the applause. Similarly, after a command performance at the Viceroy's palace, the gentry withhold their favor until the Viceroy signals his approval and asks to meet the women of the company. He, too, is taken with Camilla, who is the only person who makes him feel comfortable and light-hearted. He gives her a splendid necklace, which enrages her jealous swain, Felipe, who has been accompanying the troupe on their travels. Felipe attacks Camilla and causes a riotous backstage brawl, after which he runs off to join the army. The Viceroy has become infatuated with Camilla and announces that he has decided to pay for the coach with his own money, in order to give it to her as a love gift. This outrages the Marquise along with the rest of the nobility, who are already smarting over the Viceroy's demands for money to finance military defenses against an insurgency. Led by the Duc de Castro, they threaten to strip the Viceroy of his post, an action that can only succeed if endorsed by the country's Bishop. When the Viceroy vacillates in the face of this intimidation, Camilla spurns him in disgust. After watching a triumphant performance by Ramon in the bullring, Camilla impetuously gives him her necklace, which emboldens him to visit her lodging that night and propose that they become a celebrity couple in order to enhance their earning power as performers. There he encounters Felipe, who has returned from extended army service in order to reclaim Camilla and take her away with him to live a simple life among the natives. While the two men fight each other with swords, the Viceroy arrives to tell Camilla that he has defied the nobility and is giving her the coach, which she can claim from him immediately. Upon questioning, he admits to her that he expects the Bishop, who arrives on the morrow, to approve the nobles' plan to depose him. Felipe and Ramon are arrested for dueling in public. All is resolved the next morning when Camilla gives the coach to the Bishop as a gesture of piety. The Bishop announces his plan to use the coach to transport the sacraments to sick and dying peasants and calls for peace and reconciliation among all the disputing parties. As the curtain falls, Don Antonio reminds Camilla that, as an actress, she is only able to realize her true self when she is performing on the stage.

A French-Italian co-production, it was filmed in English. A shoot in French was planned as well, but it had to be abandoned due to financial problems. Renoir let his assistant director Marc Maurette direct the dubbing in French. The French version was the first to appear in theaters. An Italian version was also made. Renoir repeatedly preferred the English version: it was the only one to be restored in 2012. Fran√ßois Truffaut reportedly referred to The Golden Coach as \\"the noblest and most refined film ever made\\". ‚ÄúIn its own time, The Golden Coach was an international failure in all three language versions with both the critics and the public.‚Äù ‚ÄúSeen today by the international community of cinephiles as a truly 'beauteous' and 'ravishing' comic fantasy from Jean Renoir‚Äôs late period, The Golden Coach can best be appreciated as an illustrious filmmaker‚Äôs elegant tribute to the theater. The ‚Äúcomedy‚Äù... is based... on a clear-eyed vision of art's denial of 'normal' life. Instead of seeking the nonexistent 'psychology' of the characters, one must follow the flowing images as a mobile painting driven by Magnani and Vivaldi across the canvas of an Italianate spectacle. Eric Rohmer has described The Golden Coach as 'the open sesame' of all Renoir's work. The two customary poles of his work‚Äîart and nature, acting and life‚Äîtake shape in two facing mirrors, which reflect each other's images back and forth until it is impossible to tell where one ends and the other begins.‚Äú References External links The Golden Coach an essay by Andrew Sarris at the Criterion Collection Category:1952 films Category:French films Category:French-language films Category:1950s adventure comedy films Category:Films based on works by Prosper M√©rim√©e Category:Films directed by Jean Renoir Category:Films set in Peru Category:English-language French films Category:French films based on plays Category:1952 comedy films ","title":"The Golden Coach"},{"id":"3653878","text":"Paul Weinstein Jr. speaking at 2012 Johns Hopkins Commencement Paul J.

Where Renoir‚Äôs previous film Le Carosse d‚Äôor had celebrated the 18th-century Italian commedia dell‚Äôarte, this work is a homage to the Parisian caf√©-concert of the 19th century with its popular singers and dancers. Visually, the film evokes the paintings of Edgar Degas and the Impressionists, including his own father, Pierre-Auguste Renoir. It also marked his return to France and to French cinema after an exile that began in 1940. It was shot at the Joinville Studios in Paris. The film's sets were designed by the art director Max Douy. Plot Set in 1890s Paris, Henri Danglard is the owner of a cafe, which features his mistress, Lola, as a belly dancer. Losing money, Henri finds himself in Montmartre and finds that the old-fashioned can-can is still being performed there. Inspired, Henri comes up with a new business scheme that aims to revive the can-can, featuring a new dancer, Nini, a laundress he meets by chance.

The film's original French title was Elena et les Hommes, and in English-speaking countries, the title was Paris Does Strange Things. It is the third addition to the trilogy, preceded by The Golden Coach (1953) and French Cancan (1955). A restored copy has been released in the 21st century. Plot Produced in 1956, and set in 1890 France, Elena and Her Men tells the story of a young, beautiful, and free-spirited Polish princess in fin de si√®cle Paris who specializes in granting people good luck. Elena's family has run out of money, and in order to save them, she agrees to marry a wealthy, older family friend. No sooner has she agreed to this engagement, then she meets a handsome stranger during a 14 July celebration, who turns out to be the famous General Rollan's aide, Count de Chevincourt (Mel Ferrer). Sparks fly with the Count, but when he introduces Elena to General Rollan (Jean Marais), the General is quite taken with her as well. By the end of the day, Elena finds her hands full with her engagement and the romantic interests of two new men. To further complicate matters, General Rollan's political advisers see the General's romantic interest in Elena as a way to influence him to take over the French government, and they employ her to grant him the luck he needs to do so. As the movie progresses, a comical battle of juggling responsibilities develops in each character. Elena feels it is her moral duty to honor her engagement, and to help the General save France, but in her heart she loves the Count. The Count is loyal to his general and country, but is unwilling to concede Elena to the General. The General is in love with Elena but already has a mistress and is preoccupied with his growing political role in France. When the General is deliberately posted to a remote town by the French government to prevent a coup d'√©tat, Elena follows, trying to help save France. The Count pursues her, trying to win Elena's heart. The film concludes with Elena and the Count kissing in a brothel window, impersonating Elena and the General, providing a decoy so that the General and his mistress are able to escape France disguised as gypsies. The General abandons his political obligations and Elena, and the show of affection between Elena and the fake General sparks their love for each other touching the hearts of the people watching, and causing a wave of true love to pass over the town and mend political tension.

The character of General Rollan was based on the historic General Boulanger. In 1886, Boulanger had much popular support personally despite the French defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, and some supporters urged him to conduct a coup d'√©tat. (He did not.) Reception Ingrid Bergman's performance was highly praised. Roger Ebert wrote that she played a Polish princess who could affect the future of France, but he said, that's just what the plot is about. > \\"The movie is about something else - about Bergman's rare eroticism, and the > way her face seems to have an inner light on film. Was there ever a more > sensuous actress in the movies? Fran√ßois Truffaut, reviewing this film, > observed that 'sex is the only focus of attention'.\\" He says that \\"Renoir preserves a strong erotic and romantic thread (the love between Bergman and Ferrer) all the way through the movie's farcical elements.\\" Christopher Faulkner described the film as a farce dealing with many issues and incidents similar to Renoir's well-known Rules of the Game. But he wrote that it is somewhat \\"cynical,\\" despite its lightness. He says that \\"the point is made that a woman can only find (provisional) power within representation, on a stage, playing a part. At the end of the film, as coup d‚Äô√©tat dissolves into coup de th√©√¢tre, the suggestion is that all effective power is actually a function of performance.\\" References External links  Category:1956 films Category:1950s romantic comedy-drama films Category:French films Category:Italian films Category:French-language films Category:French romantic comedy-drama films Category:Films directed by Jean Renoir Category:Films set in the 1880s Category:1956 comedy films Category:1956 drama films Category:Italian romantic comedy-drama films ","title":"Elena and Her Men"},{"id":"3653891","text":"Fidel de Castro (24 April 1911 - 9 June 2007) was a Filipino film actor.

The dish is of Teochew origin and is commonly served in a number of countries such as Chaoshan (China), Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. Mee pok is commonly served tossed in a sauce (often referred to as \\"dry\\", or tah in Hokkien ()), though sometimes served in a soup (where it is referred to as \\"soup\\", or terng). Meat and vegetables are added on top. Mee pok can be categorised into two variants, fish ball mee pok (yu wan mee pok), and mushroom minced meat mee pok (bak chor mee). Bak chor mee is usually exclusively prepared using thin noodles (\\"mee kia\\"), while yu wan mee can be cooked with other noodle varieties. Mee pok is a staple commonly offered in hawker centres and coffee shops (Kopitiams in parts of Southeast Asia) in Singapore, together with other Chinese noodle dishes.  Mee pok sauce  The sauce in which the noodles are tossed in is a very important aspect of the dish, and is considered a representation of the cook's skill and experience. The importance of the sauce in mee pok can be thought of similarly as the sauces that accompany pasta. The sauce consists of 4 components: chili, oil, vinegar and other condiments such as soy sauce and pepper. The chili is made from various ingredients and its preparation often includes frying and blending. Oil, traditionally lard, ensures a smooth texture in the noodles, although vegetable oil is sometimes used as a healthier though less tasty version. Vinegar is added for its sourness, and diners may specify how much vinegar is used. The chili sauce may be replaced with tomato ketchup for children and others who are uncomfortable with the spiciness of the chili.  Soup  Soup is served in a bowl as a side dish accompanying the \\"dry\\" variant, or served together with the noodles for the \\"soup\\" version where the sauce is omitted. Traditionally, the soup is boiled and simmered overnight with old hen, pork bones, dried sole fish, and soybean. The resulting broth is rich in taste and cloudy in appearance.  Mee pok noodles  Mee pok noodles sold in Bukit Batok, Singapore. Usually, the noodles are factory-made, and requires substantial preparation before cooking. Different hawkers prepare and cook their noodles differently, but the desired outcome is the same: springy al dente noodles. Hawkers often toss the noodles vigorously to remove excess flour and soda and to separate noodles which have stuck together. Other processes include stretching the noodles, cutting into a desired length, and separating into serving portions. The cooking process of the noodles consists of blanching in hot and cold water multiple times, though some hawkers omit the cold water. The noodles are drained and placed in either sauce or broth.  Bak chor mee  Bak chor mee (), which translates to minced meat noodles, is a Singaporean noodle dish popularly sold as street food in hawker centers and food courts. The noodles are tossed in vinegar, minced meat, pork slices, pork liver, stewed sliced mushrooms, meat balls and bits of deep-fried lard. Bak chor mee can be categorised into two variants: a dry version and a soup version. Most dry versions come with slices of stewed mushroom, minced pork, slices of lean pork and sometimes fried ikan bilis, atop noodles tossed in a punchy chilli-vinegar sauce, while soup versions are lauded for the depth of pork flavour in its broth. Singapore's bak chor mee was listed as the top world street food by World Street Food Congress.  Fish ball mee pok  A bowl of \\"dry\\" fish ball mee pok. This version of is usually served with toppings of fish balls, sliced fish cakes, (a type of small dumpling made with fish meat paste wrapping a small bit of minced meat), minced meat, meat balls, lettuce or taugeh (beansprouts in Hokkien). It can be made with the addition or omission of any of the toppings, prepared in soup or \\"dry\\" style, and either with or without the chili sauce.  Other types of toppings  Newer varieties of toppings include deep fried dumplings, abalone slices, imitation crab stick, and other processed fish products. In popular culture  * Mee Pok Man is the title of a film directed by Eric Khoo, a Singaporean film director. * Bak chor mee featured prominently in an episode of The Mr Brown Show, which satirized the James Gomez saga during the 2006 Singapore general elections.

The film launched the career of Alberto Sordi, one of post-war Italy's most significant and popular comedians, who stars with Franco Fabrizi and Franco Interlenghi in a story of five young Italian men at crucial turning points in their small town lives. Recognized as a pivotal work in the director's artistic evolution, the film has distinct autobiographical elements that mirror important societal changes in 1950s Italy.Kezich, 130 Recipient of both the Venice Film Festival Silver Lion in 1953, and an Academy Award nomination for Best Writing in 1958, the film's success restored Fellini's reputation after the commercial failure of The White Sheik (1952).

Sandra Rubini (Leonora Ruffo), elected \\"Miss Siren of 1953\\", suddenly grows upset and faints: rumours fly that she's expecting a baby by inveterate skirt chaser Fausto Moretti (Franco Fabrizi).

Moraldo Rubini (Franco Interlenghi), Sandra's brother and the youngest of the five vitelloni, uncomfortably observes Fausto's womanizing as he ponders his own existence, dreaming of ways to escape to the big city. Riccardo (Riccardo Fellini), the baritone, nourishes unrealistic ambitions to sing and act. Alberto (Alberto Sordi), the daydreamer, is supported by his mother and self-reliant sister, Olga (Claude Farell). Vulnerable and effeminate, he's unhappy that Olga is secretly dating a married man.

Back from his honeymoon and settled in with Sandra, Fausto is forced to accept a job as a stockroom assistant in a religious-articles shop owned by Michele Curti (Carlo Romano), a friend of his father-in-law's. Incorrigible, Fausto pursues other women even in his wife's presence. At the annual masquerade ball, Fausto is bedazzled by the mature beauty of Giulia Curti (L√≠da Baarov√°), his employer's wife. Alberto, in drag and half-drunk, executes a surrealistic dance across the ballroom floor with a goofy carnival head made of papier-m√¢ch√©. Returning home at dawn, Alberto is devastated to find his sister running off for good with her married lover. Fausto's naive attempt to seduce Giulia results in his being humiliated and then fired by her husband. In revenge, he steals the statue of an angel in gold paint from his former employer, enlisting the loyal Moraldo to help him sell it to a monk. Suspicious, the monk turns down the offer. Fausto ends up leaving the statue with a simple-minded peasant (Silvio Bagolini) who sets the angel on a mound outside his hovel, caressing it. One evening after a variety show, Leopoldo agrees to accompany old Sergio for a walk along the seashore to discuss the merits of his play but when the actor propositions him, he takes to his heels in horror. Learning of Fausto's one-night stand with a variety performer, Sandra runs away from home, taking the baby with her. Riccardo, Alberto, Leopoldo, and Moraldo all join in Fausto's desperate search to trace his wife and child. When they find her at the home of Fausto's father, Francesco pulls off his belt in a rage and finally whips his son. Later, and reconciled for the present, Fausto and Sandra walk home happily and with optimism about their life together. Resolved to abandon the provincial monotony of his dead-end town, Moraldo boards the train for anyplace else (Rome), imagining his vitelloni friends sleeping their lives away.

Rovere had solid reasons for turning it down: apart from the script of La Strada being an unrecognizable genre, Fellini's last film, The White Sheik, had been a critical and commercial flop. In a show of solidarity, Rovere loaned the script to a Venetian professor of calligraphy turned film producer, Lorenzo Pegoraro, who had admired The White Sheik. Convinced that La Strada would never attract an audience, Pegoraro requested that Fellini develop a comedy instead. Biographers differ as to who conceived I Vitelloni. For Tullio Kezich, it was Fellini who hit on the idea \\"after an afternoon-long consultation\\" with Ennio Flaiano.Kezich, 131 For Hollis Alpert, it was Pinelli brain-storming with Fellini and Flaiano who came up \\"with a notion the other two liked: the pleasures and frustrations of growing up in a provincial town\\".Alpert, 81 Under Fellini's supervision, all three together rapidly wrote the script, pooling their adolescent memories while inventing new ones. =Title= Distributors interested in the script demanded a title change: incomprehensible to a general audience, I vitelloni was a liability to an already risky venture. Fellini adamantly refused to change it, having chosen the film's title after \\"being called a vitellone by an elderly woman expressing disapproval of one of his pranks\\". For him, vitelloni were \\"the unemployed of the middle class, mother's pets. They shine during the holiday season, and waiting for it takes up the rest of the year\\". According to biographer Alpert, the term was Romagnol for \\"veal, or calf... used to refer to callow youths\\". Today, the term is widely translated as \\"big calves\\". The actual origin of the term has been defined as a cross between the Italian words for veal (vitello) and beef (bovino) implying \\"an immature, lazy person without a clear identity or any notion of what to do with his life\\".Bondanella, 90 In a 1971 letter, co-screenwriter Ennio Flaiano offered a fuller meaning of the word: \\"The term vitellone was used in my day to define a young man from a modest family, perhaps a student ‚Äì but one who had either already gone beyond the programmed schedule for his coursework, or one who did nothing all the time... I believe the term is a corruption of the word vudellone, the large intestine, or a person who eats a lot. It was a way of describing the family son who only ate but never 'produced' ‚Äì like an intestine, waiting to be filled.\\"Kezich, 132. This explanation also was proposed by Tullio Pinelli in a 2001 research interview for the documentary, Fellini: I'm a Born Liar (2002). Cin√©Libre (Paris), Issue July 2003. =Casting= Despite his reputation as box office poison, and against Pegoraro's express wishes, Fellini once again cast Alberto Sordi in a major role. Intent on playing the lead, however, Sordi didn't accept Fellini's offer until later in production.Kezich, 134 Pegoraro's skeptical distributors, far from closing the deal, demanded a clause in the contract banning Sordi's name from theatrical posters.Kezich, 133 To make matters worse, Fellini also cast Leopoldo Trieste (the lead in The White Sheik fiasco) as the budding dramatist, and his brother Riccardo, a total unknown, to interpret his own role. Further unknowns included Franco Interlenghi and Leonora Ruffo who had just wrapped on The Queen of Sheba. Although Czech actress L√≠da Baarov√° had a cult following, she was more famous for her love affair with Nazi Joseph Goebbels than for any of her film roles. Fellini topped things off by casting Franco Fabrizi as Fausto, an actor who had begun his film career in 1950 with Michelangelo Antonioni's Chronicle of a Love but had recently bombed in Christ Passed by the Barn. Pressured by his financial backers ‚Äì a Florentine business group and the Paris-based Cit√© Film, Pegoraro finally balked at the lack of a star. \\"Sordi makes people run away,\\" he complained to Fellini. \\"Leopoldo Trieste is a nobody. Meet me half way ‚Äì bring in a name.\\"Alpert, 82 To placate him, Fellini contacted Vittorio De Sica, hoping to convince him to play the part of Sergio Natali, the aging ham actor. When Fellini outlined the homosexual overtones of the role, De Sica accepted provided it were written with \\"a great deal of humanity\\".Alpert, 83 In the end, he rejected the offer, \\"concerned about being marked as actually gay\\".Kezich, 135 Fellini then decided that De Sica would have been \\"too nice, too fascinating, too distracting\\" and cast Achille Majeroni, a respected stage actor, in the part. =Filming and editing= Described as an \\"itinerant production\\", shooting was tailored to accommodate Sordi's variety show schedule, requiring Fellini and his troupe to follow him from town to town across Italy. On tour in the Big Ruckus, Sordi rehearsed his role and was ready for filming during his hours off. Accordingly, when the actor toured Florence, shooting began as an all- night party at the city's Teatro Goldoni in early December 1952.Alpert, 84 Supervised by production manager Luigi Giacosi whom Fellini had first met while on location in Tripoli during the war, and photographed by veteran cinematographer Otello Martelli, the rushes served as the basis of the masquerade ball, a major sequence. With a break in production for Christmas, shooting resumed on January 15, 1953. Constrained by the shoestring budget, many scenes were shot in a natural decor. In Ostia, a quay provided the winter setting for Fausto and his gang to wander around listlessly staring at the sea. In Fiumicino, the terrace of the Kursaal Hotel was the backdrop for the beauty pageant that opens the film. Accustomed to movies produced on promises, Giacosi maintained morale by ensuring that cast and crew dined in the best restaurants in the towns they visited. Working with several cinematographers over a six-month period, Fellini developed a predominant camera style based on slow tracking shots that \\"match the listless, purposeless lives\\" of his characters.Bondanella, 96 Zooms underscored dramatic events, most notably when Sandra falls ill at the beauty pageant, after the birth of her child, and when Francesco beats his wayward son. With editor Rolando Benedetti, Fellini established a rhythm in which short sequences were separated by abrupt cuts while longer sequences used dissolves. The numerous brief and disparate episodes \\"governed by their own internal logic\\" were thus held together by a particular editing pattern. A freeze-frame was used to immobilize the young Guido, Moraldo's friend, at the end of the film when he balances himself on a railtrack. Critical response Italy and France Screened in competition at the 14th Venice International Film Festival on 26 August 1953, the film was awarded the Silver Lion by Italian poet Eugenio Montale who headed the jury, along with a public ovation and acclaim from the majority of critics.Alpert, 85 \\"Belying all doubts about its appeal\\", the film opened on September 17, 1953 to both commercial and critical success. Reviewing for La Stampa, Mario Gromo argued that it was a \\"film of a certain importance because of its many intelligent moments, its sound portrayal of provincial life, and because it is the second film of a young director who evidently has considerable talent... The Italian film industry now has a new director and one who puts his own personal ideas before any of the customary traditions of the trade. Fellini's is a fresh approach\\".First published 9 October 1953 in La Stampa (Turin). Fava and Vigano, 73 \\"It is the atmosphere that counts most in this unusual film,\\" wrote Francesco C√†allari of the Gazzetta del Lunedi, \\"an intensely human and poetical atmosphere altogether estranged from the provincialism of the setting... Fellini has something to say and he says it with an acute sense of observation... Here is someone apart from the other young directors of post- war Italian cinema. Fellini has a magical touch.\\" First published 31 August 1953 in the Gazzeta del Lunedi (Genoa). After praising Fellini's Venice triumph, Ermanno Contini of Il Secolo XIX outlined the film's weaknesses: \\"I Vitelloni does not have a particularly solid structure, the story is discontinuous, seeking unity through the complex symbiosis of episodes and details... The narrative, built up around strong emotions and powerful situations, lacks solid organic unity, and at times this undermines the story's creative force, resulting in an imbalance of tone and pace and a certain sense of tedium. But such shortcomings are amply atoned for by the film's sincerity and authenticity.\\"First published 28 August 1953 in Il Secolo XIX (Genoa). Fava and Vigano, 75 Arturo Lanocita of Corriere della Sera wrote: \\"I Vitelloni gives a graphic and authentic picture of certain aimless evenings, the streets populated by groups of idle youths... The film is a series of annotations, hints, and allusions without unity... With a touch of irony, Fellini tries to show the contrast between the way his characters see themselves and the way they really are. Despite its weaknesses, the film is one of the best in recent years.\\"First published 28 August 1953 in Corriere della Sera (Milan). Fava and Vigano, 75 For Giulio Cesare Castello of Cinema VI, the film proved \\"that Fellini is the Italian film industry's most talented satirist, and an acute observer and psychologist of human behaviour. Like any good moralist, he knows how to give his story a meaning, to provide more than just simple entertainment\\".First published 31 August 1953 in Cinema VI (Milan). Fava and Vigano, 75 Fellini's first film with international distribution,Kezich, 137 I Vitelloni did reasonable box office in England and North America while performing \\"huge in Argentina\\". Opening in France on 23 April 1954, it was especially well received. Andr√© Martin of Les Cahiers du Cin√©ma insisted that by \\"virtue of the quality of the narrative, and the balance and control of the film as a whole, I Vitelloni is neither commercial nor does it possess those traits that usually permit a work of art to be consecrated and defined. With a surprising and effective sense of cinema, Fellini endows his characters with a life both simple and real\\".First published May 1954 in Les Cahiers du Cin√©ma. Fava and Vigano, 76 Film critic Genevi√®ve Agel appreciated the maestro's symbolism: \\"Fellini films a deserted piazza at nighttime. It symbolizes solitude, the emptiness that follows communal joy, the bleak torpor that succeeds the swarming crowd; there are always papers lying around like so many reminders of what the day and life have left behind.\\"Alpert, 86 United States I Vitelloni opened in the United States on 7 November 1956 to generally positive reviews. In his New York Times review, Bosley Crowther reported that Fellini, with \\"his volatile disposition and a desire to make a stinging film... does certainly take a vigorous whiplash to the breed of over-grown and over-sexed young men who hang around their local poolrooms and shun work as though it were a foul disease. He ridicules them with all the candor of his sharp neo-realist style, revealing their self-admiration to be sadly immature and absurd. And without going into reasons for the slack state of these young men, he indicates that they are piteous and merit some sympathy too\\".First published 24 October 1956 in The New York Times. Fava and Vigano, 76 For John Simon, Nino Rota's music was one \\"of the most brilliant features of the film... The first [of its two main themes] is a soaring, romantic melody that can be made to express nostalgia, love, and the pathos of existence... Slowed down, [the second main theme] becomes lugubrious; with eerie figurations in the woodwinds it turns sinister. The quicksilver changes in the music support the changing moods of the story\\".Alpert, 87 The film was re-released internationally on the tenth anniversary of Fellini's death in 2003. For the San Francisco Chronicle, Mick LaSalle noted that I Vitelloni was \\"a film of sensitivity, observation and humor ‚Äì a must-see for Fellini enthusiasts and a worthwhile investment for everyone else. Those less taken by the maestro may find I Vitelloni to be a favorite among his works\\".LaSalle, Mick. San Francisco Chronicle, film review, 2003. Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune wrote: \\"In Italy, it remains one of Fellini's most consistently loved movies. It should be in America as well... If you still remember that terrific drunk scene, Alberto Sordi's pre- Some Like It Hot drag tango or the way the little boy balances on the train track at the end, you should know that this picture plays as strongly now as it did in 1956 or whenever you first saw it. I know I had a ball watching I Vitelloni again. It reminded me of the old gang.\\"Wilmington, Michael. The Chicago Tribune, film review, 2003. =Influence= One of Fellini's most imitated films,\\"There are so many imitators,\\" wrote Kezich, \\"it's impossible to list them all.\\" Kezich, 137 I Vitelloni inspired European directors Juan Antonio Bardem, Marco Ferreri, and Lina Wertm√ºller, and influenced Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets (1973), George Lucas's American Graffiti (1973), and Joel Schumacher's St. Elmo's Fire (1985), among many others according to Kezich. These include Philip Kaufman's The Wanderers (1979). While Barry Levinson's Diner (1982) features a similar group of young men, Levinson has said he never saw I Vitelloni before making his own film.Farber, Stephen New York Times, 1982 In a 1963 edition of Cinema magazine, acclaimed director Stanley Kubrick cited the film as one of his top 10 favourite films.

Set in the South of England at Downs Park, a small fictional preparatory school for boys, it follows the lives of the members of the staff over a couple of years. The teachers see themselves as a close-knit community; however, time and again antipathies, rivalries, personal problems, tragedy and death affect the peaceful and harmonious life at the school. The title of the novel refers to the commemorative plaque which lists all the pupils who have won scholarships to public schools[UK independent schools]. Downs Park's academic record is not impressive, so throughout the novel the headmaster tries to attract gifted boys for his school. Plot summary Cyril Annick and his wife Grace have been running Downs Park for many years. Both are universally respected and loved by staff and pupils alike. Unforeseen problems for the school arise when the idiosyncrasies and compulsions of individual members of the staff threaten to upset life at the school. There is Rupert Massinger, the second master, whose womanizing makes victims of both the school secretary and the headmaster's grown-up daughter. Also, with money he has inherited Massinger is planning to take over the school and gently force the Annicks into early retirement. To everyone's surprise, as a strategic move, Massinger and his wife, who also teaches at the school, decide to resign, to reculer pour mieux sauter. Elspeth Murray, the middle-aged French mistress, has been feeling extremely lonely since her husband's death and has only taken up teaching recently to find some sort of distraction. At first, her irrational sexual attraction to Betty Cope, a pretty young lesbian who assists Grace Annick in her capacity as Matron, causes some eye-rolling. Later, when a series of petty thefts occurs everyone suspects a pupil to be stealing his schoolmates' things. However, Murray turns out to be a kleptomaniac, and when she is caught in the act she thinks she cannot cope any longer and commits suicide in the school swimming pool. Leo Canning, the young science master whose humble social background and troubled childhood make it difficult for him to adapt to the thoroughly bourgeois atmosphere of the school, falls in love with Penelope Saxton, the headmaster's young widowed daughter, and in the end they get married. However, it takes Penelope a long time until she makes up her mind to spend the rest of her life with Canning. In the meantime, she is courted by the father of the youngest staff member, a baronet called Sir James Pettifer whose aristocratic ways she finds quite alluring. More trouble appears with the arrival of Norman and Delia Poole, who have come to replace Massinger and his wife. It does not take the staff long to discover that Delia is a hopeless alcoholic whose pathetic attempts at rationalizing her addiction are embarrassing to everyone who happens to witness them. She has to give up her art classes quite soon again and over the following months mainly stays at their home on the school grounds. Finally, although he is a popular teacher, Norman Poole hands in his notice to be able to care for his wife full-time. Cyril Annick has no intention to retire, let alone hand over to Massinger. However, when his wife suffers a mild stroke he sees it as the last straw and willy-nilly sells out to him. The Annicks move to a flat in nearby Eastbourne, where shortly afterwards Grace has another stroke and dies. Not yet 60, Cyril Annick moves to London to be near his daughter and son-in-law.

History On October 6, 1998, construction began for the Hawaiian Waters Adventure Park. The water park was the first venture by limited liability company, Waters of Kapolei. Owned by dentist Jack Harrington and lawyer Brooks Cutter, Waters of Kapolei, LLC invested $14 million in the park. The park officially opened on May 28, 1999. In the park's first month of operation, it experienced 20% higher-than-expected attendance, resulting in a total of 440,000 visitors in its first year of operation. This saw the park add a new attraction just one year after opening. In May 2007, Wet'n'Wild Hawaii opened Island Adventure Golf, an 18-hole high-end miniature golf facility. The miniature golf course features lush tropical landscape, nine ADA-compliant holes, a putting green, surfboard hazards, water ways, waterfall, large ocean and beach area, mock fish and sea turtles, lava rock formations and coral reef displays. In March 2008, an agreement was announced in which the park would be sold to Village Roadshow Limited, making Wet'n'Wild Hawaii the Australian company's first theme park in the United States.

Engineers Canada serves these associations, which are its sole members, by delivering national programs for standards of engineering education, professional qualifications and professional practice. The organization was established in 1936 as the Dominion of Canada Council of Professional Engineers. In the late 1950s, the name became the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers (French: '). In 2007, the organization operated under the business name Engineers Canada. In 2014, the official name was changed to Engineers Canada. In addition to being the voice of the engineering regulators in national and international affairs, Engineers Canada coordinates the development of national policies, positions and guidelines on behalf of the engineering profession. It also promotes greater understanding of the nature, role and contribution of professional engineers and engineering to society, and undertakes federal government relations and national media relations on behalf of, and in consultation with, the provincial and territorial associations. Governance Engineers Canada is governed by a board of directors. Each engineering regulator has one or more seats on the board on a representation by population basis. All board members are volunteers. The work of the board is supported by Engineers Canada staff. Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board The Canadian Engineering Accreditation Board (CEAB) is a committee of the Engineers Canada Board. CEAB accredits Canadian undergraduate engineering programs that meet the profession's education standards. Graduates of those programs are deemed by the profession to have the required academic qualifications to be licensed as professional engineers in Canada. CEAB is also involved in assessing the equivalency of the accreditation systems used in other nations relative to the Canadian system, and monitoring the accreditation systems employed by the engineering bodies which have entered into mutual recognition agreements with Engineers Canada.http://www.engineerscanada.ca/e/pr_accreditation.cfm International activities Engineers Canada negotiates education-based international mutual recognition agreements on behalf of Canada's engineering profession. These agreements mainly recognize the equivalency of the accreditation systems (engineering education) used in other countries with the Canadian system. Engineers who are graduates of an accredited or recognized engineering program offered in a country where an Engineers Canada agreement applies are generally considered to meet the academic requirements to be licensed as professional engineers in Canada, making it easier for Engineers Canada's members to evaluate the academic credentials of international engineering graduates and for Canadian engineers to work and be licensed as engineers in other countries. Engineers Canada has signed agreements with engineering organizations in other countries. In most cases, these organizations are based in countries where the accreditation of engineering programs is a key foundation for the practice of engineering; high academic standards of engineering education exist and are required for registration; and the engineering profession is well regarded either through statute or convention. For example, Engineers Canada has signed mutual recognition agreements of qualified/licensed engineers with both Hong Kong and Australia. Engineers Canada has also negotiated a recognition agreement on full professional practice, the NAFTA Mutual Recognition Document, to support greater mobility for engineers from Canada, Texas and Mexico, and has developed a national register of qualified Canadian engineers as part of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Engineer Register initiative. An implementation protocol to implement the NAFTA document is currently being developed. The APEC Register initiative sets out criteria for the creation of national registers of qualified engineers, which would facilitate the negotiation of bilateral mobility agreements between participating signatories. Engineers Canada has also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Colegio Federado de Ingenieros y Arquitectos de Costa Rica that provides assurance to the Colegio's stakeholders that Engineers Canada will continue to work with them on the development of their accreditation system. Such cooperation will enhance Costa Rica's accreditation system, improve the quality assurance in the Costa Rican engineering faculties and therefore provide better professionals to serve our communities. Engineers Canada has participated in the discussion about climate change, has developed an Engineers Canada Infrastructure Climate Risk Protocol and has been a delivery partner of Government of Canada on building capacity to assess infrastructure vulnerability of Honduras.

Some honorary assistant bishops are bishops who have resigned their see and returned to a priestly ministry (vicar, rector, canon, archdeacon, dean etc.) in an English diocese. A current example of this is Jonathan Frost, Dean of York, who is also an honorary assistant bishop of the Diocese of York, with membership of the diocesan House of Bishops (i.e. sits and votes with the archbishop and bishops suffragan in Diocesan Synod). =Ex- colonials= From the mid-19th to the mid-to-late 20th centuries, with the population growth of England, diocesan bishops sought out various levels of episcopal assistance. Suffragan bishops had been legally possible but never appointed for over two hundred years, and there were many ecclesiological, pragmatic and theological objections to their use. So Ordinaries took to appointing Englishmen who had been consecrated bishops for the colonies as stipendiary assistant (or coadjutor ‚Äî without right of succession) bishops in their diocese, often with another post such as an especially notable (or lucrative) living. As this practice increased, it drew heavy criticism for depriving those colonies of 'their' bishop. The trends of 'returning' bishops slowly faded with the resumption of old and erection of new suffragan sees, which started in 1870 with Dover and Nottingham and continued steadily 'til Brixworth in 1989. These were bishops were titled quite inconsistently, and referred to as assistant bishops, coadjutor bishops, and even as suffragan bishops; the most stable forms were \\"Assistant Bishop of {Diocese}\\" and \\"Bishop {Surname}\\".Podmore, Colin \\"Dioceses and Episcopal Sees in England: A Background Report for the Dioceses Commission\\" (Archive accessed 3 June 2019) =Recent stipendiaries= From 1987 until 2016, there were two successions of assistant bishops who were active rather than retired: the Assistant Bishop of Newcastle and the Assistant Bishop of Leicester. In practice, they acted almost exactly like a suffragan bishop (those dioceses had none), whereas they were actually stipendiary assistant bishops. Following the passage of the Bishops and Priests (Consecration and Ordination of Women) Measure 2014 by General Synod, further appointment to these roles was made untenable. Therefore, when their incumbents retired in 2016 and 2017 respectively, they were replaced with suffragan bishops: the Bishop of Berwick (a see abeyant since the 16th century) for the Diocese of Newcastle, and the Bishop of Loughborough (a newly-erected see) for the Diocese of Leicester. Anglican Church of Australia In the Anglican Church of Australia, the appointments of assistant bishops have been made in accordance with the Assistant Bishops' Canon since 1966.The Assistant Bishops' Canon 1966 In the Australian dioceses, these assistant bishops function similarly to suffragan bishops in England (the Australian church has no suffragans per se). According to the 1966 canon, while the term coadjutor bishop may be used for an assistant bishop, no bishop may have the right or expectation to succeed to a diocesan see.

WarBreeds was released on March 23, 1998. \\"March 23, 1998: Several new titles have been spotted in stores, including WarBreeds from Red Orb Entertainment...\\" The game is set in a far off galaxy where the humanoid amphibian race called the Yedda have died out due to famine, disease and civil war, leaving their four former servitor races to fight for supremacy for their planet. WarBreeds features the ability to fully customise the warriors with many types of weapons which provide over 35,000 unique combinations. The central theme and mechanic of the game is genetic engineering. Gameplay WarBreeds includes skirmishes, a multiplayer mode, and campaigns. WarBreeds has four playable sides, only two of which are playable in campaign mode. As the campaign progresses, another side joins with the player, providing more depth in what they do with their warriors. WarBreeds provides a different concept on construction of units and buildings as compared with other real time strategy games. WarBreeds allows the player to create many units and structures, but it limits the player on the amount of structures by making them harvest power from spore pods. Although other RTS games use units to gather resources like food, lumber, gold, Vespene gas, Tiberium, etc., resources in WarBreeds are harvested by buildings at a constant rate based on the abundance of resources within a certain radius of those buildings. The player is also limited on how many units they can create. A major gameplay factor in WarBreeds is the ability to collect DNA from dead enemies, thereby gaining their technologies. Players can gain access to alternate tech trees in some other RTS games, but only Warbreeds makes it a constant, crucial part of gameplay. Clans There are four playable clans in Warbreeds, each with their own characteristics. Each race has its own variant of Shaman (the builder/tech class used to plant crops and create structures), and then four units. The game's setting establishes that the Tanu, Kelika, and Sen-Soth were created as servitor races to the Yedda, the first sapient inhabitants of the planet Aeolia; then a group of Yedda religious reactionaries tried to create a prophesied holy warrior‚Äîthe Magha'Re. The Magha, however, proved to be homicidal and ran the Yedda almost to extinction. The three other races quickly adapted to the Yedda technology, revealing themselves to be far more intelligent than their creators had intended, and became viable competition to the Magha, engaging in a four-way war. The Tanu campaign mode has the Kelika as eventual allies, and the Magha's campaign has them eventually enslave the Sen-Soth. =Tanu= The saurian Tanu are all reptilian and have orange as a dominant color. Their units are the fastest movers. Their units are the Scouts (bipedal, swift-moving, fragile units who can mount two weapons), Raptors (a more warlike Scout who can take a head- mounted weapon as well as arm-weapons, as well as having an increase in resilience), Ophidians (large, four-legged creatures who take two shoulder mounts and a head mount; fast speed and moderate armor), and the dirigible Jubjub, which has a natural light laser weapon. The Tanu's indigenous tech includes defensive structures and most melee weapons. =Kelika= The elephantine or cetacean Kelika are blue with some purple. They tend to be slow, but they can take a beating. Their units are the Thumper (small, fast- moving creature with a natural buzzsaw attack), the Mongrel (gangly bipedal creature), the Behemoth (similar to an Ophidian, but slower and with more armor), and the mighty Leviathan (notable for being one of two units in the game which can take four arm-weapons, their spinning attack, and also for the phenomenal amount of punishment they can endure). The Kelika's indigenous tech includes an eclectic array of structures and armaments, including at the highest level the Summoner structure and the Missile limb-weapon, two of the most powerful weapons in the game. =Sen-Soth= The insectoid Sen-Soth are colored purple, yellow, and green. Their units tend to be relatively fragile, but are moderately quick, and have very fast development times, allowing them to quickly grow formidable numbers of troops. They include the lightly armed Snipe, the quadrupedal Myrmidon, the giant Dhuganaya (the other unit with four weapon mounts), and the flying Aphid (the only flying unit which allows the player to choose its weapons). The Sen-Soth's indigenous tech includes helpful support structures, perception enhancing Eyestalks, and good ranged weapons. =Magha= Unlike the other three races, the Magha have no immediate counterpart, apart from looking demonic or devilish. Their units are characterized by red and white, and two of their units have a stealth feature; after being out of combat for a short period of time, the Shadows and Reavers become invisible to the enemies. Their units are the four-legged Shadows, the bladed-armed Dervishes (who attack by spinning their arms like a circular saw), the tall, bipedal Reavers, and the aerial Vipers, who function as bombardiers. The Magha's indigenous tech includes landmines, teleporters, whips, and explosive weapons including the kamikaze.

In relation to other bishops, a diocesan bishop may be a suffragan, a metropolitan (if an archbishop) or a primate. They may also hold various other positions such as being a cardinal or patriarch. Titular bishops in the Roman Catholic Church may be assistant bishops with special faculties, coadjutor bishops (these bishops are now named as coadjutors of the dioceses they will lead, and not as titular bishops), auxiliary bishops, nuncios or similar papal diplomats (usually archbishops), officials of the Roman Curia (usually for bishops as heads or deputies of departments who are not previous ordinaries), etc. They may also hold other positions such as cardinal. The see of titular bishop is only nominal, not pastoral- meaning he does not exercise final authority as the head bishop (the ordinary), or have the right to automatically succeed the aforementioned individual (the coadjutor), over an existing diocese or archdiocese or their Eastern rite equivalents, (arch-)eparchies. Titular bishops may be active or retired. Occasionally, as a priest, they may have been given a titular bishopric or archbishopric as an honor by the Pope, similar to when he names some cardinals.Code of Canon Law (1983), canon 376.

A classical example is the VIV of an underwater cylinder. You can see how this happens by putting a cylinder into the water (a swimming-pool or even a bucket) and moving it through the water in the direction perpendicular to its axis. Since real fluids always present some viscosity, the flow around the cylinder will be slowed while in contact with its surface, forming the so- called boundary layer. At some point, however, this boundary layer can separate from the body because of its excessive curvature. Vortices are then formed changing the pressure distribution along the surface. When the vortices are not formed symmetrically around the body (with respect to its midplane), different lift forces develop on each side of the body, thus leading to motion transverse to the flow. This motion changes the nature of the vortex formation in such a way as to lead to a limited motion amplitude (differently, than, from what would be expected in a typical case of resonance). VIV manifests itself on many different branches of engineering, from cables to heat exchanger tube arrays. It is also a major consideration in the design of ocean structures. Thus study of VIV is a part of a number of disciplines, incorporating fluid mechanics, structural mechanics, vibrations, computational fluid dynamics (CFD), acoustics, statistics, and smart materials. Motivation They occur in many engineering situations, such as bridges, stacks, transmission lines, aircraft control surfaces, offshore structures, thermowells, engines, heat exchangers, marine cables, towed cables, drilling and production risers in petroleum production, mooring cables, moored structures, tethered structures, buoyancy and spar hulls, pipelines, cable- laying, members of jacketed structures, and other hydrodynamic and hydroacoustic applications King, Roger (BHRA Fluid Engineering), Vortex Excited Structural Oscillations of a Circular Cylinder in Steady Currents, OTC 1948, pp. 143-154, Ocean Technology Conference, 6-8 May, 1974, Houston, Texas, USA. https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/OTC-1948-MS.

Vortex-induced vibration (VIV) is an important source of fatigue damage of offshore oil exploration drilling, export, production risers, including steel catenary risers (SCRs) and tension leg platform (TLP) tendons or tethers. These slender structures experience both current flow and top-end vessel motions, which both give rise to the flow-structure relative motions and cause VIVs. One of the classical open-flow problems in fluid mechanics concerns the flow around a circular cylinder, or more generally, a bluff body. At very low Reynolds numbers (based on the diameter of the circular member) the streamlines of the resulting flow is perfectly symmetric as expected from potential theory. However, as the Reynolds number is increased the flow becomes asymmetric and the so-called K√°rm√°n vortex street occurs. The motion of the cylinder thus generated due to the vortex shedding can be harnessed to generate electrical power.Soti A. K., Thompson M., Sheridan J., Bhardwaj R., Harnessing Electrical Power from Vortex-Induced Vibration of a Circular Cylinder, Journal of Fluids and Structures, Vol. 70, Pages 360‚Äì373, 2017, DOI: jfluidstructs.2017.02.009 The Strouhal number relates the frequency of shedding to the velocity of the flow and a characteristic dimension of the body (diameter in the case of a cylinder). It is defined as St=f_{st}D/U and is named after ƒåenƒõk (Vincent) Strouhal (a Czech scientist).Strouhal, V. (1878) \\"Ueber eine besondere Art der Tonerregung\\" (On an unusual sort of sound excitation), Annalen der Physik und Chemie, 3rd series, 5 (10) : 216‚Äì251. In the equation fst is the vortex shedding frequency (or the Strouhal frequency) of a body at rest, D is the diameter of the circular cylinder, and U is the velocity of the ambient flow. =Lock-in range= The Strouhal number for a cylinder is 0.2 over a wide range of flow velocities. The phenomenon of lock-in happens when the vortex shedding frequency becomes close to a natural frequency of vibration of the structure. When this happens large and damaging vibrations can result. Current state of art Much progress has been made during the past decade, both numerically and experimentally, toward the understanding of the kinematics (dynamics) of VIV, albeit in the low-Reynolds number regime. The fundamental reason for this is that VIV is not a small perturbation superimposed on a mean steady motion. It is an inherently nonlinear, self- governed or self-regulated, multi-degree-of-freedom phenomenon. It presents unsteady flow characteristics manifested by the existence of two unsteady shear layers and large-scale structures. There is much that is known and understood and much that remains in the empirical/descriptive realm of knowledge: what is the dominant response frequency, the range of normalized velocity, the variation of the phase angle (by which the force leads the displacement), and the response amplitude in the synchronization range as a function of the controlling and influencing parameters? Industrial applications highlight our inability to predict the dynamic response of fluid‚Äìstructure interactions. They continue to require the input of the in- phase and out-of-phase components of the lift coefficients (or the transverse force), in-line drag coefficients, correlation lengths, damping coefficients, relative roughness, shear, waves, and currents, among other governing and influencing parameters, and thus also require the input of relatively large safety factors. Fundamental studies as well as large-scale experiments (when these results are disseminated in the open literature) will provide the necessary understanding for the quantification of the relationships between the response of a structure and the governing and influencing parameters. It cannot be emphasized strongly enough that the current state of the laboratory art concerns the interaction of a rigid body (mostly and most importantly for a circular cylinder) whose degrees of freedom have been reduced from six to often one (i.e., transverse motion) with a three-dimensional separated flow, dominated by large-scale vortical structures.

LightJet printers are no longer manufactured but are however remanufactured and resold; and their lasers are still manufactured. LightJet is a trademark of Oc√© Display Graphics Systems, a division of Oc√© N.V. (the company that acquired Cymbolic Sciences, Inc.) In 2010 Oc√© was acquired by Canon of Japan. The term \\"LightJet\\" is often used to generically describe a digitally made chromogenic print. Competing manufactures of equipment include ZBE Chromira and Durst Lambda.Luxlab Glossary (2011), , Luxlab, retrieved on 27 March 2011 They may be used in Minilabs. Details Unexposed silver-halide (AgX) photographic paper is temporarily fixed on a stationary internal drum, where three digitally controlled lasers simultaneously expose the photo-sensitive emulsion on the paper medium (or back-lit transparency medium) with red, green and blue laser light. The amount of light from each laser varies to provide specific color and density values for each pixel imaged to the print. The light-path includes a spinning surface coated mirror mounted on an air-bearing that travels along the axis of the internal drum, thus reflecting the laser light at 90 degrees allowing for a dimensionally consistent round imaging dot across the entire area of the photographic paper. The purpose of this round imaging dot is to maintain edge to edge sharpness on the final print. The print is then processed using traditional photochemical means (usually RA4). After which the photographic print is handled just as any other photo-print. Whereas xerography and inkjet printing employ a halftone process and ink to reproduce digital images on paper, digital-C is a photographic continuous tone process rather than halftone or error diffusion which are common on offset press or ink-jet. The device natively supports 24-bit RGB raster files, and is capable printing vector based files when fronted by a photographic Raster Image Processor (RIP). 24 bit color continuous-tone devices use large multitudes of colors, up to 16,777,216, rather than the small number of colors available to 4-color press and 8-color ink-jet type devices. Therefore, posterization and banding are unlikely from these types of prints when provided with a file of good integrity. Due to slight halation of the light source, digital C-prints produced on high end equipment have true continuous tones not possible with images created with ink or pigments (due to CMYK halftone limitations). LightJet printers and film recorders are used by a number of professional- level photographic printing firms. Most deliver a final product printed on Fujifilm Crystal Archive or Kodak Endura paper in sizes up to at least 4√ó10 feet. Other silver-halide based materials can also be printed on laser driven devices such as the LightJet. The LightJet printers were manufactured in Vancouver, BC, Canada; the core internal drum technology was developed by Dan Gelbart at MacDonald Dettwiler & Associates (MDA) in the 1980s, and later refined by Cymbolic Sciences. Key individuals responsible for the success of LightJet series include Dale Benjamin, Tim Crandall, Rolf Dekleer, Dave Fraser, Robert Heath, Alex Holowko, Larry Kiser, Miranda Clegg, Chris Lynn, Wenny Macura, Derek Montgomery, Dan Murray, Karen Neufeld, Didier Primat, Alastair Reed, Jeff Rittichier, Horst Schaaf, Ken Smith, and Dan Whittle. The original LightJet image recorder was introduced at PMA in 1995. The first version of the product was the LightJet2000, a three-laser continuous-tone film recorder (the selling price was US$195,000). Its maximum image size was 11√ó14 inches. The LightJet2000 largely replaced the Fire1000 film recorder. The LightJet5000 large-format printer was introduced at PMA in 1996. The product produced continuous-tone photographic prints and Duratrans up to 50√ó50 inches. In 1997 a version capable of printing to a dimensional size limit of 50√ó100 inches was introduced.

With his wife Sailaja 'Sal' Tahiliani, he co-founded Ensemble, India‚Äôs first multi-designer boutique in 1987, followed by Tahiliani Design studio in 1990. Based in Delhi, he is best known for his ability to infuse Indian craftsmanship and textile heritage with tailored silhouette. His signature is to combine traditional aesthetics with modern design. Over the years, he also became known for his bridalwear. Of late, Tahiliani has taken on several projects in interior design. He has designed interiors for hotels (such as The Sofala, Goa), restaurants (the Aish at the Park, Hyderabad), resorts and homes, and has even begun to event design for Indian weddings. Early life and family Tahiliani was born and brought up in Mumbai in extended Sindhi family. His father Admiral R H Tahiliani, was with the Indian Navy, thus his family including sister Tina Tahiliani were posted to various locations in India. After studying initially at Campion School, Mumbai, then during his teenage, his father was posted to Delhi, then he went to study at The Doon School, a boarding school in Dehradun, passing out in 1980. After his schooling he joined St. Stephen's College in Delhi as an honours student. However, not finding it challenging enough, he left it after a year and then went on US, where he studied at Vassar College, New York for one year, and went on to obtain a degree in Business Management from the Wharton Business School, University of Pennsylvania.Designs on the bride : Simply Chennai - India Today His father, later served as the Chief of the Naval Staff of the Indian Navy between 1984 and 1987 and as the Governor of Sikkim between 1990 and 1994. His mother Jaswanti Tahiliani was the first female engineer in Mumbai, who studied at VJTI, Mumbai. She died of cancer, while he was still studying at Doon School, a few years later his father remarried to Meera. While studying in US, through a common friend, he met Sailaja (Sal), an economics student at the University of Pennsylvania, and his future wife. They married soon after his return to India in 1980. Sal, who was brought up in New York, had a short modelling career wherein she even modelled for Pierre Cardin, before heading Tahiliani retail operations. The couple have two sons. Career Logo of Tahiliani's eponymous brand On returning to India, he first joined the family business in oil-field equipments. Eventually, in 1987 he and Sailaja opened the first multi-designer boutique in India, 'Ensemble' with help of designer Rohit Khosla in Mumbai. The stored featured works of five designers Abu Jani & Sandeep Khosla, Rohit Khosla, Anuradha Mafatlal, American fashion designer Neil Bieff and label Anaya, by Anita Shivdasani and Sunita Kapoor, Anil Kapoor‚Äôs wife and their own label, Ahilian. By now, he had started sketching however he was still untrained a designer, thus in 1991, he went to Fashion Institute of Technology (FIT) in New York to study designing. After his return he shifted business to Delhi. When in 1995, British heiress Jemima Khan wore one of his outfit for her wedding to Imran Khan, his work was first noticed. Today, after over 25 years, Ensemble has stores both in Mumbai and Delhi, and Tahiliani runs the chain with his sister Tina Tahiliani Parikh, who joined the business in 1990.

Marston was involved with establishing Balboa Park, the San Diego Public Library System, and San Diego Presidio Park. His contributions to San Diego earned him the affectionate title of \\"San Diego's First Citizen.\\" Early life and career Marston was born in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin. As a boy, Marston learned to ice skate, which he continued to enjoy throughout his life. His father had a chronic respiratory ailment and wanted to live in a better climate for his health, so the family moved to San Diego in 1870. Marston was initially a clerk in the Horton House Hotel, then entered the mercantile business as a bookkeeper with the firm of Aaron Pauly & Sons general merchandise store and warehouse merchants. Pauly was the founder of the San Diego Chamber of Commerce. Marston was its secretary and later its president. In 1872, Marston clerked for storekeeper Joseph Nash. He and partner Charles Hamilton bought Nash out and ran the store. After Marston's marriage, he split the store business with his partner Hamilton, with Hamilton taking the grocery side and Marston taking the dry goods. The Marston Company, at 5th Avenue and C Street in downtown San Diego, became the only major department store in the city. In later years, two additional suburban stores opened. Their success was due to exclusive business arrangements that Marston made with several suppliers. He became quite wealthy and was a generous philanthropist in the city. The stores were sold to The Broadway in 1961. The downtown flagship store has since closed. Marston's business trips took him to major cities such as San Francisco and New York City, where he saw great urban parks. This developed a desire to see San Diego's Balboa Park become as great. As a result of his efforts in park development and planning, Marston helped make Balboa Park a local landmark. Marston hired architect John Nolen to develop the first plan for the park in 1908 and a more-detailed plan in 1926. Marston served as chairman of the Buildings and Grounds Committee for the 1915 Panama‚ÄìCalifornia Exposition in Balboa Park. The Exposition established an infrastructure of museums and attractions for the park that still exists today. A statue by Ruth Hayward of Marston with other significant founders of San Diego stands in Balboa Park. Philanthropy In 1907, Marston bought Presidio Hill with the intent of preserving the old Presidio of San Diego, the first European settlement in present-day California, which had fallen into ruins. He couldn't get anyone interested in the project, so he built Presidio Park in 1925 with his own funds, hiring Nolen to plan the park. He commissioned the building of the Serra Museum, designed by architect William Templeton Johnson, in Presidio Park. He donated the park to the city in 1929. Presidio Park, still a city- owned historic park, is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Marston served on the first board of trustees for the San Diego Public Library in 1882 and founded the San Diego YMCA, serving as its president for 22 years. He was on the city council from 1887 to 1889. In 1928 he founded the San Diego Historical Society (now the San Diego History Center) and served as its first president. Marston also raised funds and donated his own money to buy land for present-day Torrey Pines State Reserve and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park. Marston served as a founding trustee for Pomona College and funded a number of the campus's early buildings. He gave $100,000 () to endow the college's central quadrangle, which is named after him. George W. Marston House and Gardens George Marston's Residence at 3525 Seventh Avenue was designed by Irving Gill and William S. Hebbard architects in 1904/1905.McCoy, p. 87. The residence initially was planned to be built in English Tudor style, but was completed in the Arts and Crafts style, which was becoming in vogue. The property, dubbed the George W. Marston House and Gardens, was donated to the City of San Diego by Marston's daughter Mary in 1987 and is now a museum at the northwest corner of Balboa Park.Marston House website Save Our Heritage Organisation (SOHO) took over operation of the property in July 2009 and is in the process of restoring the gardens and furnishing the home in appropriate period style. Politics Marston was active politically and called himself an \\"independent\\". He was raised a Republican, but swung back and forth between Democrat and Republican, supporting the party or person most likely to push for reform. He supported California's reform-oriented Progressive Party in the 1910s and early 1920s. Marston ran for mayor unsuccessfully in 1913 (against Charles F. O'Neall) and again in 1917 (against Louis J. Wilde). The 1917 race, in particular, was a classic growth-vs.-beautification debate. Marston argued for better city planning with more open space and grand boulevards; Wilde argued for more business development. Wilde called his opponent \\"Geranium George\\", painting Marston as unfriendly to business. Wilde's campaign slogan was \\"More Smokestacks\\", and during the campaign, he drew a great smokestack belching smoke on a truck through the city streets. The phrase \\"smokestacks vs. geraniums\\" is still used in San Diego to characterize this type of debate. Local horticulturist Jim Zemcik has produced a \\"Geranium George\\" series of geranium varieties in Marston's honor, including one variety named for his wife Anna Gunn Marston, who was an avid gardener. Personal life In 1878, he married Anna Lee Gunn (May 20, 1853 October 7, 1940), a teacher. They had five children. Her brother Douglas Gunn was the owner and editor of San Diego Union and served as Mayor of San Diego from 1889 to 1891. George Marston died at age 95 at his home in San Diego. He is interred in Mount Hope Cemetery. For the eulogy at his funeral, James A. Blaisdell spoke of Marston's impact on Balboa Park, \\"Just around the corner lies the central Balboa Park of the city --walks that he laid out--flowers that he planted--trees that he loved--vistas that he foresaw--beautiful buildings that he envisioned. ... This paradise was not here when George Marston came [in 1870]. In this park he speaks to thousands whose lives have been made happier through him.\\"Showley, p. 124. Quote :I feel the development of the city's beauty and civic welfare can go along with the industrial development ... I am in favor of all things that make for commerce, manufacturing, for all business activity . . . It is absurd to say that I am not in favor of industrial development. I believe in a Greater San Diego--everything that makes for a bigger city. Let us build a great city on a good foundation. Let us have our industries as large as possible. Let us build a complete city.

The slaves who lived at Horton Grove were held by the influential Bennehan and Cameron families. In 1860, 900 total slaves were held on the complex. The several structures still standing at Horton Grove are the only two-story slave residences remaining in North Carolina. The quarters at Horton Grove, which were constructed by slave craftsmen in the early 1850s, were the culmination of decades of gradual improvements at the plantation complex. The dwellings at Horton Grove represented the pinnacle of slave house development and include shuttered windows, multiple stories, brick chimneys, and raised stone foundations. These structures were occupied continuously until as late as the 1970s. After the American Civil War, many of the former slaves stayed on the property as sharecroppers and continued to live in these dwellings. Because of its historic and architectural significance, Horton Grove was listed in 1978 on the National Register of Historic Places. Archaeological finds on the site have provided insight into continuing practices of African heritage at Stagville, including the presence of divining rods and communal cooking practices.

It was released in some English-speaking countries under the alternative titles For My Sister, Fat Girl and Story of a Whale. Plot Ana√Øs and her older sister, Elena, are vacationing with their parents on the French seaside. Bored of staying in their vacation home, the two walk into town while discussing relationships and their virginity. Although the highly attractive Elena has been promiscuous, she is saving herself for someone who loves her, while heavy-set, overweight Ana√Øs thinks it is better to lose one's virginity to a \\"nobody\\" just to get it over with. They meet an Italian law student, Fernando, at a cafe. While Elena flirts with him, Ana√Øs orders a banana split. Later, Fernando sneaks into the girls' bedroom for a liaison with Elena. Ana√Øs is awake and watches their entire interaction. After a conversation about Fernando's previous relationships with other women, Elena consents to have sex with him, but backs out at the last minute. Frustrated, Fernando pressures her through various means, including threatening to sleep with some other woman just to alleviate himself. Finally, Elena is coerced into anal sex as a \\"proof of love\\", although it is obviously a painful experience for her. In the morning, Fernando asks for oral sex from Elena before he leaves, but Ana√Øs has had enough and tells them to let her sleep in peace. The next day, the girls and Fernando go to the beach. Ana√Øs sits in the ocean in her new dress and sings to herself while Elena and Fernando go off alone together. Later, as the girls are reminiscing about their childhood together back at the house, Elena reveals that Fernando has given her a mauve opal engagement ring while at the beach. That night, Elena gives up her virginity to Fernando as Ana√Øs silently cries on the other side of the room. Later, Fernando's mother arrives at the house that Ana√Øs and her family are renting, asking for the girl's mother to return the mauve opal ring. Their mother discovers Elena's and Fernando's relationship, and angrily decides to drive back to Paris. On the way back, she becomes tired and decides to sleep at a rest stop, where an axe murderer arrives, killing Elena with an axe and strangling her mother. He takes Ana√Øs into the woods and rapes her. When the police arrive the next morning, Ana√Øs insists he did not rape her.

Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 73% based on 86 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site's consensus reads: \\"The controversial Fat Girl is an unflinchingly harsh but powerful look at female adolescence.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 77 out of 100, based on 24 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". =Controversy= Fat Girl was banned in Ontario by the Ontario Film Review Board in late 2001 due to objections regarding the frank representation of teenage sexuality. American film critic Wheeler Winston Dixon noted that the film was not only banned in Ontario, but was \\"severely restricted to adult audiences throughout the world\\". Dixon described the film as a \\"harrowing tale of a 13-year-old girl's coming of age as her 15-year-old sister embarks on a series of sexual relationships\\", featuring \\"explicit sexual scenes\\" in a \\"brutal narrative structure.\\"Wheeler Winston Dixon, 2003, Wallflower Press, London and New York, Visions of the Apocalypse: Spectacles of Destruction in American Cinema, Retrieved November 28, 2014, (paperback) (hardcover), see page 112, lines 5-10 The ban in Canada was eventually overturned and the film played in several theatres in 2003. =Accolades= In 2001, the film won the Manfred Salzgeber Award at the 51st Berlin International Film Festival and the France Culture Award at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival.

In the 9th‚Äì14th centuries, the northern Iranian regions of Tabaristan, Daylam and Gilan, sandwiched between the Caspian Sea and the Alborz range, came under the rule of a number of Alid dynasties, espousing the Zaydi branch of Shia Islam. The first and most powerful Zaydi emirate was established in Tabaristan in 864 and lasted until 928. It was interrupted by Samanid occupation in 900, but restored in 914 by another Alid branch. The second period of the Alid emirate was plagued by internal dissensions and power struggles between the two branches, and ended in the second conquest of the region by the Samanids in 928. Subsequently, some of the soldiers and generals of the Alavids joined the Samanids, among them Mardavij, founder of the Ziyarid dynasty, and the three sons of Buya (Ali, Hassan and Ahmad), founders of the Buyid dynasty. Local Zaydi rulers survived in Daylam and Gilan until the 16th century. List of Zaydi emirs and imams of Tabaristan *Hasan ibn Zayd, adopted the regnal name al-Da'i ila'l-Haqq (864‚Äì884). He was forced to abandon Tabaristan briefly for Daylam in 869 and 874 due to invasions *Muhammad ibn Zayd, also adopted the regnal name al-Da'i ila'l-Haqq (884‚Äì900). Rule in Tabaristan proper was usurped by Abu'l-Husayn Ahmad ibn Muhammad for a few months as Muhammad was in Gurgan at the time of Hasan's death. Tabaristan was overrun briefly by Rafi ibn Harthama in 891‚Äì893, and in 900 Muhammad tried to conquer Khurasan, but was defeated and killed by the Samanids. The Samanids captured Tabaristan, and the Alavids fled to Daylam in exile (900-913). *Hasan ibn Ali al-Utrush, adopted the regnal name al-Nasir li'l-Haqq (914‚Äì917). A Husaynid from Medina, he converted the Gilites and Daylamites to the Zaydi doctrine, recovered Tabaristan. * Abu Muhammad Hasan ibn Qasim, also adopted the regnal name al-Da'i ila'l-haq (917‚Äì919, 919‚Äì923, 927‚Äì928). A Hasanid, he was the commander of the army under al-Utrush and named by the latter as his heir. His rule was challenged by al- Utrush's sons and their numerous supporters (the \\"Nasiris\\"), who seized power twice, briefly in 919 and again in 923. Regained the throne with the help of Makan ibn Kaki, ruled until he was killed in battle with Asfar ibn Shiruya. * Abu 'l-Husayn Ahmad ibn Hasan, surnamed Nasir (919, 923). Reigned jointly with his brother in 919, thereafter reconciled himself with Abu Muhammad Hasan al- Da'i until 923, when he reigned briefly until his death. * Abu 'l-Qasim Ja'far ibn Hasan, surnamed Nasir (919, 923‚Äì925). Reigned jointly with his brother in 919 and from 923 until his death. * Abu Ali Muhammad ibn Abu 'l-Husayn Ahmad, surnamed Nasir (925‚Äì927). Son of Ahmad ibn Hasan, he was chosen as emir after Ja'far died. Deposed briefly by Makan ibn Kaki, who installed Isma'il ibn Ja'far as a puppet ruler, regained the throne with the aid of Asfar ibn Shiruya. *Abu Ja'far Husayn ibn Abu 'l-Husayn Ahmad, surnamed Nasir (927). Brother of Abu Ali Muhammad, he was deposed by Makan ibn Kaki, who brought back Abu Muhammad Hasan al-Da'i.

Truthiness can range from ignorant assertions of falsehoods to deliberate duplicity or propaganda intended to sway opinions. The concept of truthiness has emerged as a major subject of discussion surrounding U.S. politics during the 1990s and 2000s because of the perception among some observers of a rise in propaganda and a growing hostility toward factual reporting and fact-based discussion. American television comedian Stephen Colbert coined the term truthiness in this meaning as the subject of a segment called \\"The W√∏rd\\" during the pilot episode of his political satire program The Colbert Report on October 17, 2005. By using this as part of his routine, Colbert satirized the misuse of appeal to emotion and \\"gut feeling\\" as a rhetorical device in contemporaneous socio-political discourse. He particularly applied it to U.S. President George W. Bush's nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court and the decision to invade Iraq in 2003. Colbert later ascribed truthiness to other institutions and organizations, including wikipedia. Colbert has sometimes used a Dog Latin version of the term, \\"Veritasiness\\". For example, in Colbert's \\"Operation Iraqi Stephen: Going Commando\\" the word \\"Veritasiness\\" can be seen on the banner above the eagle on the operation's seal. Truthiness was named Word of the Year for 2005 by the American Dialect Society and for 2006 by Merriam-Webster. Linguist and OED consultant Benjamin Zimmer pointed out that the word truthiness already had a history in literature and appears in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), as a derivation of truthy, and The Century Dictionary, both of which indicate it as rare or dialectal, and to be defined more straightforwardly as \\"truthfulness, faithfulness\\". Responding to claims by Michael Adams that the word already existed with a different meaning, Colbert said: \\"Truthiness is a word I pulled right out of my keister\\". Use by Stephen Colbert Stephen Colbert, portraying his character Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, chose the word truthiness just moments before taping the premiere episode of The Colbert Report on October 17, 2005, after deciding the originally scripted word ‚Äì \\"truth\\" ‚Äì was not absolutely ridiculous enough: \\"We're not talking about truth, we're talking about something that seems like truth ‚Äì the truth we want to exist\\", he explained. He introduced his definition in the first segment of the episode, saying: \\"Now I'm sure some of the 'word police', the 'wordinistas' over at Webster's are gonna say, 'Hey, that's not a word'. Well, anybody who knows me knows I'm no fan of dictionaries or reference books. They're elitist. Constantly telling us what is or isn't true. Or what did or didn't happen.\\" When asked in an out-of- character interview with The Onion's A.V. Club for his views on \\"the 'truthiness' imbroglio that's tearing our country apart\\", Colbert elaborated on the critique he intended to convey with the word: During an interview on December 8, 2006, with Charlie Rose, Charlie Rose (December 8, 2006), \\"A conversation with comedian Stephen Colbert\\" . Retrieved on August 14, 2008. Colbert stated: On his April 2, 2009 episode of The Colbert Report, Colbert added an addendum to the definition: a word so straight it drives men wild. Coverage by news media After Colbert's introduction of truthiness, it quickly became widely used and recognized. Six days after, CNN's Reliable Sources featured a discussion of The Colbert Report by host Howard Kurtz, who played a clip of Colbert's definition.It was also used September 23, 2008 by CNN's American Morning by John Roberts. On the same day, ABC's Nightline also reported on truthiness, prompting Colbert to respond by saying: \\"You know what was missing from that piece? Me. Stephen Colbert. But I'm not surprised. Nightline's on opposite me...\\" Within a few months of its introduction by Colbert, truthiness was discussed in The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Weekly, the San Francisco Chronicle, the Chicago Tribune, Newsweek, CNN, MSNBC, Fox News, the Associated Press, Editor & Publisher, Salon, The Huffington Post, Chicago Reader, CNET, and on ABC's Nightline, CBS's 60 Minutes, and The Oprah Winfrey Show. The February 13, 2006 issue of Newsweek featured an article on The Colbert Report titled \\"The Truthiness Teller\\", recounting the career of the word truthiness since its popularization by Colbert. =The New York Times coverage and usage= In its issue of October 25, 2005, eight days after the premiere episode of the Report, The New York Times ran its third article on The Colbert Report, \\"Bringing Out the Absurdity of the News\\". The article specifically discussed the segment on \\"truthiness\\", although the Times misreported the word as \\"trustiness\\". In its November 1, 2005 issue, the Times ran a correction. On the next episode of the Report, Colbert took the Times to task for the error, pointing out, ironically, that \\"trustiness\\" is \\"not even a word\\". Many dictionaries (e.g. American Heritage , Merriam-Webster, New Oxford Dictionary of English, etc.) offer definitions for trustiness. The New York Times again discussed \\"truthiness\\" in its issue of December 25, 2005, this time as one of nine words that had captured the year's zeitgeist, in an article titled \\"2005: In a Word; Truthiness\\" by Jacques Steinberg. In crediting truthiness, Steinberg said, \\"the pundit who probably drew the most attention in 2005 was only playing one on TV: Stephen Colbert\\". In the January 22, 2006 issue, columnist Frank Rich used the term seven times, with credit to Colbert, in a column titled \\"Truthiness 101: From Frey to Alito\\", to discuss Republican portrayals of several issues (including the Samuel Alito nomination, the Bush administration's response to Hurricane Katrina, and Jack Murtha's Vietnam War record). Rich emphasized the extent to which the word had quickly become a cultural fixture, writing, \\"The mock Comedy Central pundit Stephen Colbert's slinging of the word 'truthiness' caught on instantaneously last year precisely because we live in the age of truthiness.\\" Editor & Publisher reported on Rich's use of \\"truthiness\\" in his column, saying he \\"tackled the growing trend to 'truthiness,' as opposed to truth, in the U.S.\\" The New York Times published two letters on the 2006 White House Correspondents' Dinner, where Stephen Colbert was the featured guest, in its May 3, 2006 edition, under the headline \\"Truthiness and Power\\". Frank Rich referenced truthiness again in The New York Times in 2008, describing the strategy of John McCain's presidential campaign as being \\"to envelop the entire presidential race in a thick fog of truthiness\\", Rich explained that the campaign was based on truthiness because \\"McCain, Sarah Palin and their surrogates keep repeating the same lies over and over not just to smear their opponents and not just to mask their own record. Their larger aim is to construct a bogus alternative reality so relentless it can overwhelm any haphazard journalistic stabs at puncturing it.\\" Rich also noted, \\"You know the press is impotent at unmasking this truthiness when the hardest-hitting interrogation McCain has yet faced on television came on 'The View'. Barbara Walters and Joy Behar called him on several falsehoods, including his endlessly repeated fantasy that Palin opposed earmarks for Alaska. Behar used the word 'lies' to his face.\\" Widespread recognition A church sign stating, \\"Truthiness and Consequences\\", taken March 10, 2007, in Cape Coral, Florida Usage of \\"truthiness\\" continued to proliferate in media, politics, and public consciousness. On January 5, 2006, etymology professor Anatoly Liberman began an hour-long program on public radio by discussing truthiness and predicting it would be included in dictionaries in the next year or two. His prediction seemed to be on track when, the next day, the American Dialect Society announced that \\"truthiness\\" was its 2005 Word of the Year, and the website of the Macmillan English Dictionary featured truthiness as its Word of the Week a few weeks later. Truthiness was also selected by The New York Times as one of nine words that captured the spirit of 2005. Global Language Monitor,http://www.languagemonitor.com which tracks trends in languages, named truthiness the top television buzzword of 2006, and another term Colbert coined with reference to truthiness, wikiality, as another of the top ten television buzzwords of 2006, the first time two words from the same show have made the list. The word was listed in the annual \\"Banished Word List\\" released by a committee at Lake Superior State University in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, in 2007. The list included \\"truthiness\\" among other overused terms, such as \\"awesome\\" celebrity couple portmanteaus such as \\"Brangelina\\", and \\"pwn\\". In response, on January 8, 2007, Colbert said Lake Superior State University was an \\"attention-seeking second-tier state university\\".Colbert Report Episode 3001 (1/8/2006) overview The 2008 List of Banished Words restored \\"truthiness\\" to formal usage, in response to the 2007‚Äì2008 Writers Guild of America strike. =American Dialect Society's Word of the Year= On January 6, 2006, the American Dialect Society announced that \\"truthiness\\" was selected as its 2005 Word of the Year. The Society described its rationale as follows: > In its 16th annual words of the year vote, the American Dialect Society > voted truthiness as the word of the year. First heard on The Colbert Report, > a satirical mock news show on the Comedy Central television channel, > truthiness refers to the quality of preferring concepts or facts one wishes > or believes to be true, rather than concepts or facts known to be true. As > Stephen Colbert put it, \\"I don't trust books. They're all fact, no heart.\\" =Merriam-Webster's Word of the Year= On December 10, 2006, the Merriam- Webster Dictionary announced that \\"truthiness\\" was selected as its 2006 Word of the Year on Merriam-Webster's Words of the Year, based on a reader poll, by a 5‚Äì1 margin over the second-place word google. \\"We're at a point where what constitutes truth is a question on a lot of people's minds, and truth has become up for grabs\\", said Merriam-Webster president John Morse. Truthiness' is a playful way for us to think about a very important issue.\\" However, despite winning Word of the Year, the word does not appear in the 2006 edition of the Merriam-Webster English Dictionary. In response to this omission, during \\"The W√∏rd\\" segment on December 12, 2006, Colbert issued a new page 1344 for the tenth edition of the Merriam Webster dictionary that featured \\"truthiness\\". To make room for the definition of \\"truthiness\\", including a portrait of Colbert, the definition for the word \\"try\\" was removed with Colbert stating \\"Sorry, try. Maybe you should have tried harder.\\" He also sarcastically told viewers to \\"not\\" download the new page and \\"not\\" glue it in the new dictionary in libraries and schools. = The New York Times crossword puzzle = In the June 14, 2008 edition of The New York Times, the word was featured as 1-across in the crossword puzzle. Colbert mentioned this during the last segment on the June 18 episode of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, and declared himself the \\"King of the Crossword\\". = BBC \\"portrait of the decade\\" = In December 2009, the BBC online magazine asked its readers to nominate suggestions of things to be included on a poster which would represent important events in the 2000s (decade), divided into five different categories: \\"People\\", \\"Words\\", \\"News\\", \\"Objects\\" and \\"Culture\\". Suggestions were sent in and a panel of five independent experts shortened each category to what they saw as the 20 most important. Among the nominations selected in the \\"Words\\" category was \\"Truthiness\\". As a result, the word \\"Truthiness\\" appeared in the poster. = Research = In 2012, a study examining truthiness was carried out by PhD student Eryn Newman of Victoria University of Wellington. The experiments showed that people are more likely to believe a claim is true regardless of evidence when a decorative photograph appears alongside it. Also in 2012, Harvard University's Berkman Center hosted a two- day symposium at Harvard and MIT, \\"Truthiness in Digital Media\\", exploring \\"concerns about misinformation and disinformation\\" in new media. The Truthiness Collaborative is a project at USC's Annenberg School \\"to advance research and engagement around the misinformation, disinformation, propaganda and other challenges to discourse fueled by our evolving media and technology ecosystem\\". =What Happened= Hillary Clinton mentions the word in her 2017 book What Happened regarding the national dissolution of objective facts.\\"What Happened\\" by Hillary Rodham Clinton, 2017. Use in political and social commentary =Kitty Genovese case retrospective= As noted by Jesse Singal in an April 5, 2016 piece \\"How the False Story of Kitty Genovese‚Äôs Murder Went Viral\\" in New York magazine upon the death of Kitty Genovese's murderer, the entire escalation of a myth surrounding the murder, alleging that 38 people had been silent witnesses allowing a vicious death to proceed in front of them, was attributable to the myth's appeal to \\"truthiness\\" (grounded in fear ‚Äì of insecurity and lack of community spirit) over full investigation into actual truth: \\"Today, of course, there is exponentially more news coverage than there was in 1964 ‚Äî not to mention exponentially more attempts to slot attention-getting events into simple, truthy stories about human nature. The gap between the famous version of the Genovese story and the true one, then, is worth remembering, if only as a check on our natural tendency to hear a story and then nod along and say, 'Of course that‚Äôs what happened!'‚Äù\\"How the False Story of Kitty Genovese‚Äôs Murder Went Viral\\" =James Frey controversy= The Chicago Tribune published an editorial in its January 16, 2006 issue titled \\"The Truthiness Hurts\\", crediting the rise of truthiness as serendipitously providing an apt description of the Oprah Book Club controversy over James Frey's fictionalized \\"memoir\\", A Million Little Pieces. Truthiness was also used to describe the controversy over the factual accuracy of Frey's book by USA Today in its January 15, 2006 issue, by several other publications including The New York Times, and by the television news program Nightline on its October 23 and January 26 editions. Oprah Winfrey also discussed truthiness with Frank Rich on her show, in reference to the Frey controversy and the column \\"Truthiness 101\\" Rich had recently published in The New York Times. They also mentioned Colbert's role in making the word \\"truthiness\\". On January 27, MSNBC ran a commentary titled \\"Oprah strikes a blow for truthiness: Do facts really matter? Ask Winfrey, James Frey or Stephen Colbert\\", making the case that Winfrey's about-face on Frey's book was a \\"small (and belated) but bold nudge back out of the proud halls of truthiness\\", but also opportunistic and too little too late. =In the Canadian Parliament= In 2006, Liberal Party of Canada leadership contender Ken Dryden used truthiness as an extensive theme in a speech in the House of Commons. The speech dealt critically with the Harper government's Universal Child Care Plan. Dryden defined truthiness as \\"something that is spoken as if true that one wants others to believe is true, that said often enough with enough voices orchestrated in behind it, might even sound true, but is not true.\\" The transcript of all debates in the House (Hansard) is made available in both official languages; the translators into French chose to render \\"truthiness\\" as fausse v√©rit√© (\\"false truth\\"). =Alleged snubbing by the Associated Press and Colbert's response= The Associated Press reported on the American Dialect Society's selection of truthiness as the Word of the Year, including the following comments by one of the voting linguists: > Michael Adams, a professor at North Carolina State University who > specializes in lexicology, said \\"truthiness\\" means \\"truthy, not facty\\". \\"The > national argument right now is, one, 'Who's got the truth?' and, two, 'Who's > got the facts? he said. \\"Until we can manage to get the two of them back > together again, we're not going to make much progress.\\" On each of the first four episodes of the Report after the selection of truthiness as Word of the Year, Colbert lamented that news reports neglected to acknowledge him as the source of the word. On the first of these episodes, he added Michael Adams to his \\"On Notice\\" board, and Associated Press reporter Heather Clark, the author of the article, to his \\"Dead to Me\\" board: > \\"You see, the Associated Press article announcing this prestigious award, > written by one Heather Clark, had a glaring omission: me,\\" Colbert said > during his show Monday. \\"I'm not mentioned, despite the fact that truthiness > is a word I pulled right out of my keister.\\" Later Adams admitted the \\"absolutely hilarious\\" nature of the show and said he couldn't \\"think of any greater honor than to be placed on Colbert's 'On Notice' board,\\" and that he \\"owes Colbert thanks.\\" On the third of these episodes, he ranked the AP at the top of the \\"Threat-Down\\", one of few entries ever to gain the number one spot in place of bears. On the following episode he called Adams and asked for an apology. Though Adams never apologized, Colbert \\"accepted\\" his \\"apology\\", but failed to take him \\"off notice\\". Associated Press response to Colbert On January 13, the first day after the four-day run of criticism of the AP on the Report, the AP ran a story about The Colbert Report being upset about being snubbed by the AP, in an article titled \\"Colbert: AP the biggest threat to America\\". As he has in the past, Colbert remained in character in an interview for the story, and used it to further the political satire of truthiness; excerpts of the story are: > \\"When an AP story about the designation sent coast to coast failed to > mention Colbert, he began a tongue-in-cheek crusade, not unlike the kind his > muse Bill O'Reilly might lead in all seriousness.\\" It's a sin of > omission...' Stephen Colbert told the AP on Thursday...' It's like > Shakespeare still being alive and not asking him what Hamlet is about,' he > said.\\" \\"The Oxford English Dictionary has a definition for 'truthy' dating > back to the 1800s...' The fact that they looked it up in a book just shows > they don't get the idea of truthiness at all,' Stephen Colbert said > Thursday. 'You don't look up truthiness in a book, you look it up in your > gut. \\"Though slight, the difference of Colbert's definition and the OED's is > essential. It's not your typical truth, but, as The New York Times wrote, 'a > summation of what [Colbert] sees as the guiding ethos of the loudest > commentators on Fox News, MSNBC and CNN. \\"Colbert, who referred on his > program to the AP omission as a 'journalistic travesty,' said Thursday it > was similar to the much-criticized weapons of mass destruction reporting > leading up to the Iraq War. 'Except,' he said, 'people got hurt this time.'\\" On January 14, Clark herself responded in an article titled \\"Exclusive 'News' ‚Äì I'm dead to Stephen Colbert\\". She furthered the rise of \\"truthiness\\" in published English in conceding, \\"Truthiness be told, I never had seen The Colbert Report until my name graced its 'Dead to Me' board this week... But I will say that I watched Colbert's show for the first time... It was funny. And that's not just truthy. That's a fact.\\" =Arianna Huffington= On January 31, 2006, Arianna Huffington used truthiness in The Huffington Post. Huffington later appeared as a guest on the March 1, 2006, episode of The Colbert Report. She challenged Colbert on his claim that he had invented the word truthiness. During the interview, Colbert declared, \\"I'm not a truthiness fanatic; I'm truthiness' father.\\" Huffington corrected him, citing wikipedia, that he had merely \\"popularized\\" the term. Regarding her source, Colbert responded: \\"Fuck them!\\" =President George W. Bush= At the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, Colbert, the featured guest, described President Bush's thought processes using the definition of truthiness. Editor and Publisher used \\"truthiness\\" to describe Colbert's criticism of Bush, in an article published the same day titled \\"Colbert Lampoons Bush at White House Correspondents Dinner‚ÄîPresident Not Amused?\\" E&P; reported that the \\"blistering comedy 'tribute' to President Bush... left George and Laura Bush unsmiling at its close\\" and that many people at the dinner \\"looked a little uncomfortable at times, perhaps feeling the material was a little too biting‚Äîor too much speaking 'truthiness' to power\\". E&P; reported a few days later that its coverage of Colbert at the dinner drew \\"possibly its highest one-day traffic total ever\\", and published a letter to the editor asserting that \\"Colbert brought truth wrapped in truthiness\\". On the same weekend, The Washington Post and others also reported on the event. Six months later, in a column titled \\"Throw The Truthiness Bums Out\\", The New York Times columnist Frank Rich called Colbert's after-dinner speech a \\"cultural primary\\" and christened it the \\"defining moment\\" of the United States' 2006 midterm elections. =Charles Krauthammer= Conservative commentator Charles Krauthammer brought the term up in a discussion about President Obama on Fox News in June 2010, saying: =Cato Institute amicus brief= In 2014, the Cato Institute filed an amicus brief to the United States Supreme Court co-authored by humorist P. J. O'Rourke in the Susan B. Anthony List v. Driehaus free speech case. The brief included an extended discussion of the role of truthiness in American political discourse: =The Late Show with Stephen Colbert= Colbert refreshed \\"truthiness\\" in an episode of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on July 18, 2016, using the neologism \\"Trumpiness\\" regarding statements made by Donald Trump during his presidential campaign. According to Colbert, while truthiness refers to statements that feel true but are actually false, \\"Trumpiness\\" does not even have to feel true, much less be true. As evidence that Trump's remarks exhibit this quality, he cited a Washington Post column stating that many Trump supporters did not believe his \\"wildest promises\\" but supported him anyway.

Filmmaker Kaneto Shind≈ç adapted the script from the novel by Takashi Suzuki. The film has also screened under the titles Violence Elegy, Elegy to Violence, Elegy for a Quarrel and The Born Fighter at various film festivals and retrospectives. Plot Kiroku Nanbu (Hideki Takahashi) is a Catholic teenager attending a military-tooled middle school in 1935 Bizen, Okayama. Living in a boardinghouse, he is infatuated with his landlady's chaste daughter, Michiko (Junko Asano). Unable to express his feelings or quell his libido with masturbation, due to peer pressure, shyness, and Catholic guilt, Nanbu turns to the only outlet left available to him: crazed, brutal violence. Taken under the wing of Turtle (Y√ªsuke Kawazu ), Nanbu is taught how to fight through an elaborate training regimen. He then joins a school gang, the OSMS. A conflict between gang leader Takuan (Mitsuo Kataoka) and Turtle ensues concluding with Nanbu's usurpation of OSMS leadership. Setting a more aggressive manifesto of actively breaking all school rules, and avoiding girls entirely, he has a run- in with the school drill sergeant and is suspended. Turtle speaks to the school administration on Nanbu's behalf resulting in both students fleeing Okayama, leaving Michiko behind. Now living in the Aizuwakamatsu, Fukushima with his aunt and uncle Nanbu reenlists in school but is repulsed by his classmates' weakness. He forms a new group and heightened conflicts commence with a local gang. Michiko visits to say goodbye to Nanbu and tell him that she has decided to join a convent as she is unable to bear children. She is later waylaid by marching soldiers. Distraught to new heights, Nanbu spots a poster for (real life) radical, political activist, Ikki Kita (Hiroshi Midorigawa), whom he had met briefly in a tea house, and, reinvigorated, marches on to join in the events of Ni-niroku jiken. Most of the film is done in a light-hearted, one would even say comic, vein, including sequences of martial arts combat. Innovative editing techniques (unusual \\"jump-cuts\\") are employed as well. But the mood shifts in the closing minutes, with the column of marching soldiers callously brushing past Michiko symbolizing the rising mood of militarism as the 1930s move on toward the Japanese atrocities in occupied Chinese territory and World War II itself. When Kiroku and a pal learn of the attempted coup in Tokyo (the February 26 Incident cited previously), they decide to head there to participate. On which side will they fight, the established order or the rebels?

It is a Belle √âpoque tragedy, the story of an ill-fated love affair between characters played by Simone Signoret and Serge Reggiani. The story was loosely based on an infamous love triangle between the prostitute Am√©lie √âlie and the Apache gang leaders Manda and Leca, which was the subject of much sensational newspaper reporting during 1902. Plot Marie (Simone Signoret), a woman of considerable beauty, is distressed at her treatment by Roland, a criminal who is a part of a local syndicate. When Marie is introduced to the handsome stranger Georges, a carpenter and ex-criminal determined to go straight, by his friend Raymond, a member of Roland's gang, she is strongly and obviously attracted to him, much to the chagrin of Roland. When Roland's jealousy builds after a number of meetings between Marie and Georges, Roland decides to confront Georges behind a club where several members of his syndicate watch. After Georges gains control of a knife that had been thrown between them to initiate the fight, Georges manages to stab Roland in the back after a brief scuffle, killing him almost instantly. When the police arrive at the scene, everyone flees, including Marie, who seeks refuge away from the syndicate at a nearby village. Georges decides it is best to flee town. He is contacted by Marie and the two meet at her village. They live an idyllic life there until Georges learns that Raymond has been arrested for the murder of Roland. F√©lix, the leader of the syndicate, has framed Raymond in an attempt to bring Georges out of hiding and win control of Marie. Not realizing this, Georges confesses to the police that he is the real killer. While being transported between jails, he breaks free with the help of a diversion by Marie. Georges immediately seeks F√©lix to get revenge. When he finds him in the presence of the police, he kills him anyway, condemning himself in the process. With the two murders on his hands, Georges is sentenced to die by the guillotine, and a broken Marie watches in horror as he is executed. Cast *Simone Signoret as Marie 'Casque d'Or' *Serge Reggiani as Georges Manda *Claude Dauphin as F√©lix Leca *Raymond Bussi√®res as Raymond *William Sabatier as Roland Dupuis *Gaston Modot as Danard *Paul Barge as Police Insp. Juliani *Odette Barencey as La m√®re d'Eug√®ne *Loleh Bellon as L√©onie Danard *Dominique Davray as Julie * Jacqueline Cantrelle Final scene The film's final sequence is famous. After Manda's surrender to the police, the film shows Marie arriving at night, with one of Leca's ex-henchmen, at a cheap inn in the city, where she rents a room. The filmmakers provide no immediate clues for the audience as to why this is happening. Only later is it revealed that the room in which she is staying overlooks the courtyard in which her lover, Manda, is to be executed. British film critic Roy Armes wrote: \\"Becker shows all the hurried ugliness and squalor that surrounds the guillotine, so that we feel this execution to be an affront to humanity.\\" French New Wave director Fran√ßois Truffaut, who was a fervent admirer of the film's director, Jacques Becker, particularly praised this scene. He wrote: \\"If you're at all interested in how stories are constructed, you cannot fail to admire the ingenuity of the plot, particularly the strong, oblique, unexpected way it gets abruptly to Manda's execution in a scene that is as beautiful as it is mysterious, as the Casque d'Or [Marie] arrives in the middle of the night at a disreputable hotel. When I or any of my fellow scenarists are in trouble, we often say to each other, 'How about a Casque d'Or solution?'\\" Reception The Lexikon des Internationalen Films (Lexicon of International Film) wrote: \\"With Goldhelm, Jacques Becker has made the most stylistically clear and filmically convincing film about belle √©poque. The drawing of the shady milieu, the deeply human interpretation of the love relationship between Manda and Marie ‚Äì that is fascinatingly dramatised and convinced not least by the excellent actors Simone Signoret and Serge Reggiani. Becker proves to be a master of character representation in mastering a poetic realism that only a few directors of this time succeeded in doing.\\" Das gro√üe Personenlexikon des Films (The Great Lexicon of Film Persons) found: \\"His milieu portrait from the turn of the century, the clearly structured story about a gangster rivalry, is considered Becker's masterpiece\\". Reclams Filmf√ºhrer (Reclam's Film Guide) says: \\"Becker was not interested in making a \\"historical gangster film\\"; he created a very unusual film about the \\"belle √©poque\\", in which people are more important than events, feelings more real than criminal involvement. A film of unusual beauty, strict will to style, clear dramaturgy ‚Äì probably Becker's masterpiece.\\" Buchers Enzyklop√§die des Films (Bucher's encyclopedia of film) reads: \\"Becker gives a masterly account of Paris at the turn of the century, both in the set-up and in the drawing of the characters. Despite the bleak plot, the film has a life-affirming trait, especially in the exterior shots, which is primarily due to the strong charisma of Simone Signoret in the leading role.\\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 100% based on , with a weighted average rating of 8.5/10. Cultural references In 1986 the French Government issued a postage stamp dedicated to centenary of the French cinema depicting Jacques Becker's \\"Casque d'Or\\". In Don Winslow's novel Satori, the main female character Solange Picard watches Casque d'Or over and over in a cinema in Saigon and cries at the end of it each time. Proposed remake In 1965, MGM announced it would make a musical remake of the film produced by Jacques Bar, directed by Julien Duvivier and starring Ann-Margret.

Rex and Bree first met while attending Lake Forest College at a meeting of the Young Republicans. In Season 6, it is revealed that Rex had a son that was conceived before Rex had met Bree. This son is named Sam Allen and appears in a multi-episode arc during mentioned season. =Season 1= Rex asks Bree for a divorce during the pilot episode, saying that he could no longer \\"live in this detergent commercial\\", although the true root of their marital problems lies in Rex's failing to ask his wife to sexually dominate him. Due to Bree's inability to sexually satisfy him, he begins seeing local homemaker and prostitute Maisy Gibbons (Sharon Lawrence). Rex suffers a near-fatal heart attack while having sex with Maisy. When Rex is in the hospital, Bree discovers his affair with Maisy, and she threatens to eviscerate him. After Rex has a second heart attack, the couple decides that they should be nice to one another in the time they have left. Bree starts dating local pharmacist, George Williams, to hurt Rex, until she and Rex give their marriage another try, and Bree agrees to take part in S&M; scenarios with him. The marriage strengthens when Andrew admits he is gay. However, George falls obsessively in love with Bree.

When Bree complains about her erratic stove, Rex tells her that he cannot afford to buy her a new one, saying that maybe she should get a job of her own. As a reaction to this, Bree begins compiling recipes to make her own cookbook. Rex patronizes Bree, calling her idea foolish. Disheartened, Bree throws away her notes. It is handyman Eli Scruggs who retrieves them and gives them to Bree after Rex's funeral, suggesting that she go ahead with the idea. =Season 7= Rex briefly reappears in the season premiere \\"Remember Paul?\\" during a flashback, chatting with Carlos. =Season 8= Rex returns in \\"Women and Death\\" during one of Bree's flashbacks back to how she has a \\"mask\\" and will not let Rex know how she feels. Rex gets offended by this and goes to bed. Rex appeared amongst other deceased characters in the series finale, watching over Susan and her family as she leaves Wisteria Lane. Reception While reviewing the first season finale, Frazier Moore of USA Today theorized that Rex's death was a ruse, writing: \\"Reminder: The audience saw no death scene and no body.

This theory was proved itself wrong in the second season premiere. Ann Hodgman of Entertainment Weekly was negative in her review. She wrote that Rex's death did not come as a surprise, noting: \\"Just as a TV or movie cop is inevitably shot after he announces that he's about to retire, we know it's over for Rex the minute Bree rests her head on his feeble chest and promises him he'll make it.\\"Hodgman, Ann (May 23, 2005). \\"Tidy Endings\\".

It is based on the novel by Albert Simonin. The film was screened in competition at the 1954 Venice Film Festival. It was released in the United States as Grisbi and in the United Kingdom as Honour Among Thieves. Touchez pas au grisbi is the first of three films that comprise the Max le Menteur trilogy; it was followed by Le cave se rebiffe and Les tontons flingueurs. Background French actor Daniel G√©lin was first offered the role of Max but turned it down, seeing himself as too young for the part. Gabin then agreed to do the film, and his role helped to relaunch his career, which had been suffering since the end of World War II. Plot The entire film takes place over the course of three days. Max, a decent and principled gangster, has dinner at Madame Bouche's restaurant, a hangout for criminals, with his longtime associate Riton, their burlesque-dancer girlfriends and his protege Marco. A newspaper is seen to mention eight bars of stolen gold. The group goes to Pierrot's nightclub, where the girls perform. Max gets Marco a job as a drug dealer working for Pierrot. After the show, Max discovers Riton's girlfriend Josy making out with Angelo, another gangster; but does not disclose the affair to his friend. As Max takes a taxi home to his apartment, he is followed by two of Angelo's men in an ambulance. He gets the drop on them and drives them off, though they claim not to be after him. Max calls Riton and warns him not to go with Angelo, who had just asked Riton to do a job with him. Max and Riton go to Max's spare apartment, which Angelo does not know of. Max and Riton had previously stolen a large cache of gold, which was intended to be their final big score, and to finance their retirement. Max assures Riton that it is safe in a special car in the parking garage below. Riton says that his motivation for the theft was his fear of losing Josy, and admits hinting about it to her, to keep her love. In response Max discloses that he saw Josy and Angelo embracing in the nightclub, and berates Riton for mentioning the gold to Josy, who must have been Angelo's informant. The next morning, Max leaves early and takes the gold to a fence. He is told that the money will take a while to procure. He returns to his apartment to find that Riton has left. Max calls Josy's hotel to find that Riton was there, but was recently taken away in an ambulance, presumably the one used by Angelo's men earlier. He briefly and bitterly considers leaving Riton in the lurch, as his incompetence continually hinders Max. Loyalty prevails, though, and he sets out to recover Riton. Max begins by going to Madame Bouche's restaurant and hiring Marco as backup. They go to Josy's hotel, where Max roughly interrogates Josy about Angelo, while Marco captures Fifi, one of Angelo's thugs on the lookout for them. Learning no useful information, they proceed to Pierrot's and interrogate Fifi, with a bit more roughing-up but not much more success. Angelo telephones and proposes to trade Riton for the gold. Max agrees, and he, Marco, and Pierrot arm themselves, take the gold, and head out in Fifi's car, dropping Fifi by the side of the road. The initial exchange, on a deserted back road, goes without incident. Riton is returned unharmed, and the gold is given to Angelo. As Angelo's car drives away, Riton warns Max that, though blindfolded, he heard a second car. The second car appears in the distance, and Max warns everyone to take cover. The car drives by and its occupants blow up Fifi's car with hand grenades, killing Marco. They get out to mop up the scene, but are gunned down by Max, Pierrot, and Riton. The three of them get into the non-exploded car and chase Angelo. Riton is wounded by return fire, but Pierrot shoots out the tires and Angelo's car crashes. Angelo himself, the only survivor, stumbles out of the car and pulls out another grenade. He tries to throw it at Max's group, but is shot in the process. The grenade blows up Angelo and sets fire to his car. Max is unable to retrieve the gold from the hotly burning wreck, and they are forced to leave as a long haul truck approaches. At dawn they are back at Pierrot's, with Riton being patched up by a mob doctor. Max, careful to maintain his habitual rounds to avoid any speculation of his recent whereabouts, takes Betty, his very upper- class English lover, to Madame Bouche's restaurant for lunch, where all the talk is about the recovery of the stolen gold from the wreck of Angelo's car. Some other diners, fellow crooks, ask Max if he thinks it is true, as the papers say, that Angelo was the thief, but Max evades the question. Pierrot telephones to tell Max that Riton has died. Having lost his best friend and his fortune, Max determines to hold onto Betty as long as possible, and glumly orders the English roast beef.

It was Bertolucci's directorial debut at age 21. Plot The story is very similar to Akira Kurosawa's influential Rashomon, though in an interview Bertolucci denied having seen that film at the time. The film begins with the brutal image of a prostitute's corpse on the bank of the Tiber in Rome. We then see a series of interrogations of suspects by the police, all of whom are known to have been in a nearby park at the time of the murder. Each suspect recounts his activities during the day and evening, and each narrative serves as a slice of life story. A young man tells the police that he was meeting with priests in order to get a job recommendation, though we see that he and his friends spent the time trying to rob lovers in the park. A gigolo treats both his girlfriends badly. A soldier fails in his attempts at picking up a number of women and falls asleep on a park bench. Two teenage boys share a pleasant afternoon in the company of two teenage girls but end up stealing from a homosexual man in the park. The final flashback depicts the prostitute's murder by a man in clogs who had been interrogated previously and who is finally apprehended at a dance. Each narrative is interrupted by a sudden thunderstorm, which in each case leads to an interlude at the prostitute's apartment as she prepares for her evening. Critical reception The film was hailed by international critics as a success by a major new talent. Many Italian critics thought it was very much a Pasolini film, although Bertolucci made a conscious effort to create a distinct individual style.

The academic rank varies from undergraduate degree to master's degree. A qualification similar to the LTh is the two-year postgraduate Licentiate of Sacred Theology (STL), available from pontifical universities. United Kingdom The Licence in Theology was one of two courses (the other being the Bachelor of Arts degree course) offered by Durham University at its opening in 1833 and was first awarded in 1834. The course initially had a standard length of two years, reduced to one for graduates of Oxford and Cambridge; this was raised to three years for 1841‚Äì1846, but this led to a serious fall in numbers and it returned to two years from 1846. It ran in a variety of different forms, including being offered with honours for a period from 1864, but closed in 1946. From the late 19th century the LTh could be gained at Anglican theological colleges affiliated to Durham without the need for residence at the university. The Common Awards validated by Durham and offered to all Church of England ordinands since 2014, as well as trainee ministers from the Methodist, Baptist and United Reformed churches, include a variety of degree and non-degree qualifications. However, these follow the naming conventions of the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications and do not include a license in theology. St David's College, Lampeter awarded a Licence in Divinity (LD) from 1884 to c. 1940. The LTh, introduced in 1971, was intended for graduate ordinands, and was equivalent to the final year of a bachelor's degree. The course is now offered by the University of Wales, Trinity Saint David, the successor institution of St David's College, although titled Graduate Diploma in Bible and Theology in keeping with the Framework for Higher Education Qualifications. The University of Aberdeen offered a Licence in Theology until 2002, when it was withdrawn due to the Church of Scotland deciding to no longer recognise the degree. Canada In Canada, a four-year LTh is offered by Emmanuel College, Toronto. Australia In Australia in former years, theological colleges that were not associated with Universities offered programmes which led to the award of a Licentiate in Theology, abbreviated ThL. For many years the ThL was a prerequisite to ordination as an Anglican priest, but nowadays the ThL is a \\"non award\\" course: i.e., it is not recognised by other institutions for entry to higher degrees. People wanting to be ordained usually complete a Bachelor of Theology at an accredited university, which enables them to take an advanced degree later, if desired. New Zealand In New Zealand the LTh is offered by the Ecumenical Institute for Distance Theological Studies and was the standard avenue to ordination in the Anglican Church; it remains the standard for part-time distance ordinands.

Foreign Babes in Beijing was something of a cultural phenomenon in China, with a viewership of 600 million. The memoir follows DeWoskin's life as well as her character's plotline, and has an attention to detail and cultural analysis which she inherited from her father, Kenneth DeWoskin, who was a noted Sinologist at the University of Michigan.

It is hidden medially and superiorly to each occipital condyle. The hypoglossal nerve traverses the canal. Structure It transmits the hypoglossal nerve from its point of entry near the medulla oblongata to its exit from the base of the skull near the jugular foramen. It lies in the epiphyseal junction between the basiocciput and the jugular process of the occipital bone. Function The hypoglossal canal has recently been used to try to determine the antiquity of human speech. Researchers have found that hominids who lived as long as 2 million years ago had the same size canal as that of modern-day chimpanzees; some scientists thus assume they were incapable of speech. However, archaic H. sapiens 400,000 years ago had the same size canal as that of modern humans, meaning they could have been capable of speech. Some Neanderthals also had the same size hypoglossal canal as archaic H. sapiens. However recent studies involving several primate species have failed to find conclusive evidence of a relationship between its size and speech.02.24.99 - Graduate Students Discredit Theory that Neanderthals Could Talk Clinical significance The hypoglossal canal is formed during the embryological stage of development in mammals, sometimes leading to the presence of more than two canals as the occipital bone is formed. Study of this area aids in the diagnosis of a variety of tumors found at the base of the skull, including: large glomus jugulare neoplasms, myelomas, and the occasional meningioma. Studies of the hypoglossal canal revolve around the development of safe drilling techniques to conduct surgery on that area of the brain.

It was filmed in India. It is a coming of age film. A fairly faithful dramatization of the 1946 novel of the same name by Rumer Godden, the film attests to a teenager's coming of age and first love, with the namesake river as a central theme and backdrop. The film was produced by Kenneth McEldowney, and original music was by M. A. Partha Sarathy. The cast includes Esmond Knight, Nora Swinburne and Arthur Shields.  Plot  Harriet (Patricia Walters) belongs to an upper middle-class English family residing on the banks of the Ganges River in India. Her father (Esmond Knight) runs a jute mill, and she has four sisters. Her only brother (Richard R. Foster), somewhat ten years her junior, wants to learn how to tame cobras with a flute. Although they are raised in a genteel, English setting, and even have the benefit of a live-in nanny, their upbringings bear the mark of a curious confluence of Western and Eastern philosophies. If there ever could be a compromise between Christianity and Hinduism, they are immersed in it. (The youngest girl, for instance, has a rabbit she treats as her newborn baby, and says that some babies can be born again and again.) The tranquility of an upperclass English family lifestyle, however, takes a tumble and turns thoroughly topsy turvy when the family's neighbor invites his cousin, Captain John (Thomas E. Breen), to live with him on his plantation. When Captain John arrives, the girls discover he has lost one leg in the war. Notwithstanding his handicap, he has such an atmosphere of charm and sophistication about him that the daughters are all understandably smitten with him and therefore invite him to a Diwali celebration, complete with a formal invitation in writing, hand-delivered by the oldest daughter herself. Harriet's otherwise uneventful life contains moments worth recording and, to invite Captain John further into her life, she eventually gains the courage to show him her secret book - her diary. He politely acquiesces in a kind and fatherly way. Later, eager to impress upon him her familiarity with Hindu religion, or perhaps to divert his attention from her best friend, Harriet tells him a marriage story where mundane identities of ordinary peasants are subject to divine change and transformation. In this tale, Lord Krishna intervenes in a wedding ceremony to assume the identity of the groom, and a bride is temporarily transformed into Krishna's consort. The moral to the story is that things are not always as they seem, nor that what you see is what the other person necessarily sees, and that but for the intervention of Krishna, things taken at first appearance, may be elevated to something significantly different. One day, somewhat after the festival of Diwali, Harriet secretly follows Captain John and her best friend Valerie (Adrienne Corri), to a point on the river bank where they think they are alone. It is there that Captain John trades a passionate kiss with Valerie, which Harriet witnesses. This incident, coupled with her perceived role in the death of her brother, makes Harriet lose the will to live. Preferring to die, she runs away from home that night and attempts to commit suicide by floating down the river in an unattended canoe- like skiff. The river should not be navigated at night, as there are strong currents, and two or three people are usually needed to row a boat against the current. Overcome with very high waves, an unattended boat would take on water and sink. Dying on the river, as from a boat that sinks, would certainly have the appearance of an accident, but Harriet takes things a step further by lowering herself into the water. Her death would have been a sure thing but her brother's friend has seen her steal the boat and fishermen rally to rescue her from the water. Ashore, she is brought back to life, and the captain then kisses her on the forehead. He returns her to her home. Later in the movie, alone in a room elsewhere in the family's mansion, we discover that Captain John has a much deeper and more mature interest in Melanie (Radha Burnier), the twenty-ish, mix-blooded daughter from his cousin's marriage to an Indian national who has died. Without so much as a heated word, Captain John and Melanie appear to have reached a point where their irreconcilable differences are insurmountable. Unlike the five other girls in the movie, Melanie does not appear deluded by Captain John's bearing, and particularly on account of their culture clash finds him more overbearing and stifling than seductive. (This represents a directorial departure from the literary work the movie was based on, as the English family in the book had no admixture of blood from Indian nationals, and Melanie as a character did not exist.)

In filming this movie, Renoir made use of nonprofessional actors in key roles, including Captain John and Harriet. The future Indian film maker Satyajit Ray, then working in advertising, met Renoir while The River was in production, and the two men became friends.Bert Cardullo (ed.) 22 Satyajit Ray: Interviews, University of Mississippi Press, 2007, p.64-65 Ray met Subrata Mitra, a production assistant on this film and Ray's eventual cinematographer, during filming. Thomas E. Breen, playing Captain John, was a veteran of the United States Marine Corps who was injured during fighting on Guam in 1944, resulting in amputation of his right leg. Renoir selected him for the role without knowing that he was the son of Joseph Breen, head of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America, who was the chief censor of films in the U.S. Awards and responses At the Venice Film Festival, the film won the International Award in 1951. The National Board of Review in the United States decided that it was among the Top Five Foreign Films for 1951. Roger Ebert added The River to his \\"Great Movies\\" list in 2006.Roger Ebert. The River (Le Fleuve) February 12, 2006 Preservation The River was preserved by the Academy Film Archive, in conjunction with the British Film Institute, 2004. Influence At the New York Film Festival, director Wes Anderson, a great fan of Jean Renoir, discussed Martin Scorsese's having shown him a print of The River; it is one of Scorsese's favourite films. The River was hugely influential upon Wes Anderson's film, The Darjeeling Limited (2007), as it inspired Anderson to make a film about India.

In past times, people would form cults around death and figures. Famously, Anubis, Osiris, Hades, and La Santa Muerte have all had large cult followings. La Santa Muerte (Saint Death), or the personification of death, is currently worshiped by many in Mexico and other countries in Central America. Day of the Dead (2 November) is a celebration for the dead. History The ancient Egyptians are most famous for their fascination of death by mummifying their dead and building exquisite tombs, like the pyramids of Giza, for their dead. Many of their deities were death-related, such as: Ammut, the devourer of unworthy souls; Anubis, the guardian of the Necropolis and the keeper of poisons, medicines, and herbs; and Osiris, the king of the dead. The Greek underworld, Hades, was ruled by the god Hades, and had five rivers that flowed through it. The rivers were: Acheron, river of sadness; Cocytus, river of lamentation; Lethe, river of forgetfulness; Phlegethon, river of fire; Styx, river of hate. The Underworld had attendants who, though not rulers, were important gods and beings. The Furies were female spirits who exacted vengeance against people who committed specific crimes. Keres were female spirits of death and destruction. Persephone was the goddess of the underworld and the spouse of Hades. Thanatos, the god of death, was said to wear dark robes. The Vikings believed that if a warrior died in battle, he would be taken to the Norse afterlife: the hall of Valh√∂ll, in which the warriors would prepare for Ragnar√∂kk, the battle at the end of the world. Rune stones were erected to commemorate particularly brave warriors. Death in one's sleep (a \\"straw death\\") was considered dishonorable. =Modern Western culture= In the early part of the 20th century, it was common to hold s√©ances at dinner parties. A s√©ance is an event where a group of people (3 or more) try to communicate with the dead through one person of the group, known as a psychic medium. Today there are a number of authors who have spoken on the fascination people have with death. \\"If it bleeds, it leads\\" is a phrase related to this, meaning that in the mass media most of the material is based on death. For example: death and crime are almost always a topic in the news. The goth and metal subcultures are often associated with death and dying. Daniel Kahneman and others have studied the psychology behind this. For example, people buy insurance and make other decisions based on what comes readily to mind‚Äîe.g., the previously recorded high-water mark for a flood, rarely considering that something worse is possible and in many cases eventually likely. This interacts with the management policies of media outlets to create availability cascades and media feeding frenzies: For example, \\"strokes cause almost twice as many deaths as all accidents combined, but 80% of respondents [in a survey] judged accidental death to be more likely. ... [This is because media] coverage is itself biased toward novelty and poignancy. The media do not just shape what the public is interested in, but also are shaped by it.\\" This fascination with death and interaction with media editorial policies sometimes has problematic consequences for public policy. For example, Vincent Sacco, reprinted as chapter 2 of Potter and Kapeller (1998, pp. 37-51, esp. p. 42) and others described how the mainstream commercial media in the United States changed their editorial policies in the 1970s to focus more on the police blotter. The human psychology behind \\"If it bleeds, it leads\\" meant they could retain or even increase their audience while reducing the cost of producing the news: Investigative journalism is enormously expensive, especially if it offends a major advertiser. Focusing on crimes apparently committed by people without substantive political or economic power is cheap.

Filmed on location in Rome and Verona, the story follows a young woman (Vitti) who pursues an affair with a confident young stockbroker (Delon). The film is considered the last part of a trilogy, and is preceded by L'Avventura (1960) and La Notte (1961). L'Eclisse won the Special Jury Prize at the 1962 Cannes Film Festival and was nominated for the Palme d'Or. Described by Martin Scorsese as the boldest film in the trilogy, it is one of the director's more acclaimed works. Plot On a Monday of July 1961, at dawn, Vittoria (Monica Vitti), a young literary translator, breaks off her relationship with Riccardo (Francisco Rabal) in his apartment in the EUR residential district of Rome, following a long night of conversation. Riccardo tries to persuade her to stay, but she tells him she no longer loves him and leaves. As she walks the deserted early-morning streets past the EUR water tower, Riccardo catches up and walks with her through a wooded area to her apartment building, where they say their final goodbyes. Sometime later, Vittoria visits her mother (Lilla Brignone) at the frantic Rome Stock Exchange, which is very busy upon Vittoria's entrance. A young stockbroker, Piero (Alain Delon), overhears an inside tip, rushes to purchase the stocks, and then sells them at a large profit. He introduces himself to Vittoria; he is her mother's stock broker. Following the announcement of a colleague's fatal heart attack and a moment of silence in memoriam, the room erupts back into frenzied activity. Outside the building, Vittoria and her mother walk to an open market nearby. Vittoria attempts to discuss her own recent breakup, but her mother is preoccupied with her earned profits. That evening, Vittoria's neighbor Anita (Rosanna Rory) comes to visit and they discuss the former's breakup. Vittoria says she is depressed, disgusted, and confused. Another neighbor, Marta (Mirella Ricciardi), calls and invites them to her apartment nearby. Marta talks about the farm she and her husband have in Kenya. For a game, Vittoria dresses up as an African dancer with dark makeup, and dances around the apartment. Marta, unamused, asks her to stop. The conversation turns sour as Marta, a colonialist, worries about \\"monkeys\\" arming themselves and threatening the minority whites. Vittoria and Anita dismiss such talk. When Marta's dog Zeus gets free of the house, the women take off after him. Vittoria is fascinated by the sound of the fencing in the wind. Back in her apartment, Riccardo calls for her, but she hides and doesn't answer. The next day, Vittoria and Anita fly to Verona in a small airplane. On the way, Vittoria is fascinated by the clouds. At the airport, she watches the airplanes taking off and landing with childlike wonder. \\"It's so nice here,\\" she tells Anita. Meanwhile, back at the Rome Stock Exchange, Piero is busy making trades. Vittoria arrives at the Stock Exchange and learns that her mother lost about 10 million lire. Another man lost 50 million. Vittoria follows the man through the crowded streets to a small cafe, where she sees him drawing flowers on a small piece of paper and drinking mineral water before moving on. She meets Piero, and he drives her to her mother's apartment in his Alfa Romeo Giulietta sportscar. She shows him framed family pictures and her room growing up. Piero tries to kiss her, but she avoids his pass. Piero drives back to his office on Via Po near Via Salaria, where he must break the bad news to his investors. After work outside his office, Piero meets with a call girl he previously arranged to meet, but is disappointed that she recently changed her hair color from blonde to brunette. Deciding not to go with her, Piero drives to Vittoria's apartment and stands outside her window. He hears her typing. After a drunk walks by and notices Vittoria at the window, Piero comes over. While they are talking, the drunk steals Piero's sportscar. The next morning, Piero and Vittoria arrive at the crash site where the drunk drove the car into a lake. Vittoria watches as they pull the car with the body from the water. As they walk away, Vittoria is surprised that Piero is concerned about the dents and the motor rather than the dead man. They enjoy a playful walk through a park. When they reach her building, Vittoria unties a balloon from a carriage and calling to her new friend Marta tells her to shoot the balloon with her rifle (Marta previously having shot rhinoceros and elephants in Kenya), which she does as it ascends into the sky. When they reach her building, he kisses her, but she seems uneasy. Before she leaves, she drops a piece of wood into a barrel of water. That evening, Vittoria tries to call Piero, but his phone is busy. When she finally reaches him, she does not speak and he, thinking it's a prank call, yells into the phone and slams down the receiver. The next day, while waiting outside near her house, Vittoria looks in the barrel of water and sees the wood is still there. Piero arrives and tells her he bought a new BMW to replace his Alfa Romeo. She asks to go to his place. They walk past a nurse wheeling a young girl in a baby carriage. Piero takes her to his parents' apartment, which is filled with beautiful works of art and sculpture. As they talk, she seems nervous and unwilling to open up to him: \\"Two people shouldn't know each other too well if they want to fall in love. But then maybe they shouldn't fall in love at all.\\" They converse playfully, kiss each other through a glass window, and then kiss passionately. After he accidentally tears her dress, she goes into a bedroom and looks at the old family pictures. At the window she looks down to the street where she sees two nuns walking, some people talking at a cafe, a lone soldier standing on a corner waiting. Piero comes to the bedroom and they make love. Sometime later, Piero and Vittoria are lying on a hill looking up at the sky. He looks around and says \\"I feel like I'm in a foreign country.\\" She says that's how she feels around him. He gets upset when he doesn't understand what she's feeling. She says \\"I wish I didn't love you or that I loved you much more.\\" Sometime later at his office, Vittoria and Piero kiss and embrace playfully on the couch, even wrestling on the floor like children. When an alarm goes off, they prepare to part. They embrace and talk of seeing each other every day. They agree to meet that evening at 8 pm at the \\"usual place\\" near her apartment. That evening, on Sunday 10 September 1961, neither shows up at the appointed meeting place.The final sequence contains images that were presented earlier in the film: a nurse with a child, a horse- drawn buggy, a man walking by, trees rustling in the wind, water running from a barrel, people waiting for a bus, sprinklers going off, a blonde woman walking by, a piece of wood floating in a water barrel, and people coming home from work. The sky grows dark, and the streetlights come on.

In France, the film had 470,764 admissions.Box office information for film at Box Office Story Reception While Antonioni's earlier film L'Avventura had been derided upon its 1960 premiere, it was quickly reevaluated to the extent that L'Eclisse became \\"the most eagerly awaited film of the 1962 Cannes Film Festival\\"; critics had begun to believe that Antonioni's approach \\"was perhaps one way forward for an artform that was in danger of endlessly repeating itself.\\" L'Eclisse won the Special Jury Prize at the festival and was nominated for the Palme d'Or (Golden Palm). It is today considered one of Antonioni's more important works. David Sin wrote \\"The intervening years appear not to have diminished its impact as an innovative work of cinema, nor as a wider critique of the age in which we live. The film retains a formal playfulness, with its open form offering different ways of watching and projecting onto the characters [...] and the overall atmosphere of ennui, so beautifully constructed through sound and image, still feels heavily familiar.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called the film \\"visionary\\" and argued, \\"Antonioni opens up a sinkhole of existential dismay in the Roman streets and asks us to drop down into it. What a strange and brilliant film it is.\\" The final sequence is especially praised, with Jonathan Rosenbaum and others regarding it as one of the more effective scenes in Antonioni's oeuvre. Director Martin Scorsese, in his documentary about Italian films titled My Voyage to Italy, describes how the film haunted and inspired him as a young moviegoer, noting it seemed to him a \\"step forward in storytelling\\" and \\"felt less like a story and more like a poem.\\" He adds that the ending is \\"a frightening way to end a film... but at the time it also felt liberating. The final seven minutes of Eclipse suggested to us that the possibilities in cinema were absolutely limitless.\\" In the 2012 Sight & Sound polls conducted by the British Film Institute, L'Eclisse was voted in both the critics' and directors' polls as one of the 100 greatest films of all time. Nevertheless, disapproval of the work has occasionally been voiced. Film critic Robin Wood complained that this and all films made by Antonioni after L'Avventura were \\"self-indulgent,\\" \\"defeatist\\" and a \\"retreat into a fundamentally complacent despair.\\"Wakeman, John. World Film Directors, Volume 1. The H.W. Wilson Company. 1987. p. 65. Jon Lisi of PopMatters criticized the work as \\"strictly intellectual\\" in its returns to the viewer and wrote that viewing the film \\"isn‚Äôt exactly like watching paint dry, but the pace is so deliberately slow that it might as well be.\\" Lisi dubbed L'Eclisse \\"beautifully made, historically important, and boring as hell.\\" Conversely, Susan Doll wrote that if Antonioni's works are \\"out of vogue with movie goers captivated by postmodern irony and fast-paced editing, [...] we are the worse for it. His work reflected not only a major change in Italian society but also a profound shift in film culture. His visually driven style and provocative approach to narrative raised the bar of what constituted popular filmmaking, and audiences at the time rose to the occasion to embrace it.\\" References =Bibliography=  * External links  * Michelangelo Antonioni's L'Eclisse by David Saul Rosenfeld *L‚Äôeclisse: A Vigilance of Desire an essay by Jonathan Rosenbaum at the Criterion Collection Category:1962 films Category:Italian black-and-white films Category:Italian films Category:Italian-language films Category:1960s romantic drama films Category:Films directed by Michelangelo Antonioni Category:Trading films Category:Films with screenplays by Tonino Guerra Category:Films produced by Robert and Raymond Hakim Category:Films scored by Giovanni Fusco Category:Italian romantic drama films Category:1962 drama films ","title":"L'Eclisse"},{"id":"3654233","text":"Catsburg Store is located at the junction of Old Oxford Highway and Hamlin Road in Durham County, North Carolina.

Founded in 1896, the school currently has approximately 730 students, housed in two separate buildings. History In 1896, The Calhoun School was founded by Laura Jacobi as the Jacobi School in a brownstone at 158‚Äì160 West 80th Street. Miss Jacobi came to America from Germany with the help of her uncle, Dr. Abraham Jacobi, professor of pediatrics at New York Medical College and Columbia. Through her uncle and her aunt, Miss Jacobi was exposed to a progressive circle committed to women's rights, community health and civil reform. Initially, Miss Jacobi began her program as a \\"brother-and-sister\\" school, counting among its first students the son and daughter of Franz Boas, one of the founders of American cultural anthropology. It gradually evolved into a girls' school, attracting the daughters of socially prominent Jewish families, including Peggy Guggenheim, the children of the Morgenthaus and the Strausses. The school's nonsectarian curriculum emphasized languages and history. Eleanor Steiner Gimbel '14 remembered Miss Jacobi's commitment to civil liberties and her \\"teaching of race understanding as one of the high points of her school days.\\" In 1916, Laura Jacobi chose Mary Edwards Calhoun to succeed her as headmistress. A member of a Philadelphia Quaker family, Miss Calhoun was a former editor of the Women's Page at the Herald Tribune as well as a teacher at various schools before coming to The Jacobi School. Ella Cannon, a former employee with the National Women's Suffrage Publishing Company, was hired to teach economics and, in 1923, was named co-headmistress. The school was renamed after its beloved headmistress, Mary Calhoun, in 1924. In 1939, Miss Calhoun incorporated the school as a non-profit institution. She retired in 1942; Miss Levis continued as Head until her retirement in 1946, after which Elizabeth Parmelee and Beatrice Cosmey became co- headmistresses‚Äîremaining in that position until their retirement in 1969. Philip (Pem) E. McCurdy was selected by the Board to be the first male Head of School, and was given a mandate to guide Calhoun's transformation into a fully coeducational school (1971). Pem's initiatives were completed under the leadership of Eugene Ruth, who completed Calhoun's transformation to a progressive educational institution dedicated to \\"learner-centered instruction and independent learning\\" based on an understanding of \\"individual differences\\" in learning styles. The building opened at 433 West End Avenue at 81st Street in the spring of 1975, and the first coed class graduated that June. Under Head of School Steve Nelson, a major capital campaign was completed in 2004 that added five floors to the main building; another construction project completed in 2014 redesigned the school's facade, lobby, library and learning resource center, and expanded the lunchroom.\\"School History\\". Calhoun School. Archived from the original on May 24, 2015. Calhoun's 11th Head of School, Steven Solnick, joined the school in August 2017. Athletics Calhoun offers an extensive physical education program that promotes team play and individual fitness, and a full roster of interscholastic sports under the auspices of the New York City Athletic League (NYCAL). The Girls' Volleyball JV and Varsity teams, in particular, have been a consistent, dominant force in the league, capturing NYCAL league and championship tournament titles over the course of ten consecutive years.\\"Championships \\". Calhoun School. Basketball teams have frequently qualified for NYCAL championships and state tournaments, with several standout athletes leading the helm. Students also excel in track-and-field: their performance frequently takes them to the New York State Championships, where they've taken medals in the 100- and 400-meter races as well as the 4x100 meter relay. Facilities Classes for Calhoun's preschoolers‚Äîyoung 3s (entering at 2 years 8 months) through second graders‚Äîare held in the Robert L. Beir building on West 74th Street between Amsterdam Avenue and Columbus Avenue. The building, a renovated five-story townhouse, is home to one of Calhoun's two theaters; its own gym and rooftop garden; large, bright classrooms; a library and STEAM Discovery Lab; and an outdoor play terrace. Grades 3‚Äì12 are taught in the Main Building, located at 433 West End Avenue, at 81st Street. Originally completed in 1975, the building was designed by Costas Machlouzarides. When first built, the iconic building was frequently referred to as the \\"TV\\" school because of the design of the fa√ßade. With a major renovation in 2004 that added four new floors, and a second street-level renovation completed in 2014, the school building's unique design was modernized while still retaining its 1970s roots. Instead of halls and classrooms, the first three academic floors are divided into classroom areas by bookshelves, dividers and flexible walls. The September 2004 renovation added to the original building: * A full-sized gym and weight room * A performing arts center with theater and music rehearsal rooms * Three fully equipped science labs * A greatly expanded art studio with kiln, darkroom and woodshop * An eco-friendly Green Roof Learning Center that also provides programmable space for educational purposes, light recreation, and the school's herb and vegetable garden (for the school's nutritious lunch program). Calhoun completed a 3-month renovation project in September 2014 that included expansion of the first floor for a kitchen facility and multi- purpose lunch room/events space; and renovation of the ground floor for the school's library resource center and offices. Architecture 2009 Once called the television building because of its former fa√ßade, Calhoun's original building at 81st Street was completed in 1975 and designed by Costas Machlouzarides. In 2000, The Calhoun School hired New York-based architecture firm FXFOWLE to design a four-story addition, which was completed for the 2004 school year.FXFOWLE - The Calhoun School Expansion DesignShare, a journal of educational facilities planning, called the four-floor addition a \\"courageous design,\\" with special mention of the School's Green Roof as \\"an innovation in the architecture for learning.\\" The Green Roof and FXFOWLE were named DesignShare's recipients of a 2007 Merit Award‚Äîone of only seven recipients worldwide to receive the award. In fact, the Green Roof has attracted international attention and acclaim, with architects and educators coming from as far away as Japan, Brazil, Italy, Ireland, and Great Britain to see how the school has taken a leadership position in green architecture and sustainability. Ten years later, in the summer of 2014, the school began another 3-month renovation project of the 81st Street building with FXFOWLE, to expand the interior of the first floor by enclosing an outdoor plaza.FXFOWLE - Calhoun Commons and Learning Center The result had a significant‚Äîand positive‚Äîimpact on the face of the iconic building while maintaining the \\"overhang\\" effect that‚Äîwhen first built in the 1970s‚Äîpeople claimed looked like a Brownie camera flash cube or a television set. Performing arts Calhoun's Mary Lea Johnson Performing Arts Center is used for student productions, assemblies, and school events, as well as for Calhoun's Performing Arts Series, open to the public. The yearly series hosts professional Children's Theater, Music Concerts, Dance, Documentary Films, and Town Hall Meetings and Lectures, all at nominal cost and all open to the public.\\"Performing Arts\\".

He is remembered largely because his aristocratic student Lotario de' Conti became pope as Innocent III. In 1198 Innocent appointed him to the sinecures of prebendary and archdeacon of York. The following year Innocent raised his former master to the see of Cambrai, an immensely important diocese with a jurisdiction that covered Flanders. Peter became Archbishop of Sens in 1200. His interest in the intellectual life of Paris was undiminished: in 1210 he convoked a council at Paris that forbade the teaching, whether in public or privately, of the recently rediscovered Natural Philosophy (the Physics and very likely the Metaphysics) of Aristotle and the recently translated commentaries on Aristotle of Averro√´s (nec libri Aristotelis de naturali philosophia nec commenta legantur Parisius publice vel secreto), texts which were beginning to revolutionize the medieval approach to logical thinking, At the same time the council consigned to the public flames a work of David of Dinant that had been circulated since the end of the century, De Tomis, id est de Divisionibus (called the \\"Quaternuli\\"), which proposed that God is the matter which constitutes the inmost core of things (de Wulf 1909), a form of pantheism that was condemned by Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas.

Still Category:Obsolete occupations ","title":"Still room maid"},{"id":"3654354","text":"The still room is a distillery room found in most great houses, castles or large establishments throughout Europe dating back at least to medieval times. Original purposes Medicines were prepared, cosmetics and many home cleaning products created, and home-brewed beer or wine was often made. Herbs and flowers from the kitchen garden and surrounding countryside were preserved for flavoring food and processed into what today we call essential oils, and infused or distilled, or brewed as required to make rose water, lavender water, tinctures, peppermint-based ointments, soaps, furniture polishes, and a wide variety of medicines. The still room was a working room, part science lab, part infirmary, and part kitchen. Originally, the still room was a very important part of the household. The lady of the house was in charge of the room, and she taught her daughters and wards some of the skills needed to run their own homes in order to make them more marriageable. As practical skills fell out of fashion for high-born women, the still room became the province of poor dependent relations. Later uses In later years, as physicians and apothecaries became more widely spread and the products of the still room became commercially available, the still room increasingly became an adjunct of the kitchen. The use of the still room devolved to making only jams, jellies, and home-brewed beverages, and it became a store room for perishables such as cakes. The still room was staffed by the housekeeper or cook, then later by the still room maid. If beverages were not dispensed from food service counters, then the design of commercial kitchens in hotels and restaurants traditionally included a still room where tea, coffee and other beverages were prepared and dispensed. These would be located immediately adjacent to hotel lounges. Central in the still room would be a gas or electric water boiler and separate coffee brewers. Crockery, tea pots and coffee pots would also be stored here. Popular British manufacturers of commercial water boilers included Jacksons and Stotts of Oldham.

The film is about a man's failed attempt to murder his wife, who he believes has been unfaithful to him. Although the film, which was the first of two Sturges made for Twentieth Century-Fox, received mostly positive reviews, it was not successful at the box office. Plot Sir Alfred de Carter (Rex Harrison) is a world-famous symphony conductor who returns from a visit to his native England and discovers that his rich and boring brother-in-law, August Henshler (Rudy Vall√©e), has misunderstood Alfred's casual instruction to watch over his much younger wife Daphne (Linda Darnell) while he was away, and instead hired a detective named Sweeney (Edgar Kennedy) to follow her. Alfred is livid, and ineptly attempts to destroy any evidence of the detective's report. Eventually, despite his efforts, he learns the content of the report directly from Sweeney: while he was gone, his wife was spied late at night going to the hotel room of Alfred's secretary, Anthony Windborn (Kurt Kreuger), a man closer in age to her own, where she stayed for thirty-eight minutes. Distressed by the news, Alfred quarrels with Daphne before proceeding to his concert, where he conducts three distinct pieces of classical music, envisioning revenge scenarios appropriate to each one: a complicated \\"perfect crime\\" scenario in which he murders his wife and frames Windborn (to the Overture to Rossini's Semiramide), nobly accepting the situation and giving Daphne a generous check and his blessing (to the Prelude to Wagner's Tannh√§user), and a game of Russian roulette with a blubbering Windborn, that ends in de Carter's Suicide (to Tchaikovsky's Francesca da Rimini.) After the concert, Alfred tries to stage his fantasy of murdering his wife, but is thwarted by his own ineptness, making a mess of their apartment in the process. When Daphne returns home, he realizes that she really loves him, and learns that she is innocent of Sweeney's charges: she had gone to Windborn's room in search of her sister Barbara (Barbara Lawrence), August's wife, who was having an affair with Windborn, and became trapped there when she saw Sweeney spying on the room. Alfred begs Daphne's forgiveness for his irrational behavior, which she gladly gives, ascribing it to the creative temperament of a great artist.TCM Full synopsisErlewine, Stephen Thomas Plot synopsis (Allmovie) Cast Publicity still with Barbara Lawrence and Rudy Vallee *Rex Harrison as Sir Alfred de Carter *Linda Darnell as Daphne de Carter *Rudy Vall√©e as August Henshler *Barbara Lawrence as Barbara Henshler *Kurt Kreuger as Anthony Windborn *Lionel Stander as Hugo Standoff *Edgar Kennedy as Detective Sweeney *Al Bridge as House Detective *Julius Tannen as O'Brien *Torben Meyer as Dr. Schultz *Georgia Caine as Dowager (uncredited) *Robert Greig as Jules, the Valet (uncredited) *Max Wagner as Stage Manager (uncredited) ;Cast notes *As with the films he made at Paramount, Preston Sturges makes use of his unofficial \\"stock company\\" of character actors, including: Al Bridge, Georgia Caine, Robert Greig, J. Farrell MacDonald, George Melford, Torben Meyer, Frank Moran and Max Wagner. In addition, Rudy Vallee, Edgar Kennedy and Lionel Stander appeared in Sturges' previous film, The Sin of Harold Diddlebock. *Jimmy Conlin, one of Sturges' regular actors, played the role of Daphne's father, but the character was cut before the film was released.

Rex Harrison is shown rehearsing and directing real musicians from known orchestras. * Overture to the opera Semiramide by Gioacchino Rossini, about a femme fatale as Alfred envisages his wife to be. * Overture to the opera Tannh√§user und der S√§ngerkrieg auf Wartburg by Richard Wagner, about renunciation of carnal love for a higher and more spiritual goal, as Alfred sees himself in that situation. * The tone poem Francesca da Rimini by Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky,TCM Music referring to the infernal destiny awaiting an adulterous wife, such as Dante's character. Production Preston Sturges wrote the original screen story for Unfaithfully Yours in 1932 - the idea came to him when a melancholy song on the radio influenced him while working on writing a comic scene. Sturges shopped the script to Fox, Universal and Paramount who all rejected it during the 1930s.TCM Notes In 1938, Sturges envisioned Ronald Colman playing de Carter, and later initially wanted Frances Ramsden - who was introduced in Sturges' 1947 film The Sin of Harold Diddlebock - to play Daphne; but by the time casting for the film began, he wanted James Mason for the conductor and Gene Tierney for his wife. Studio attorneys were worried about the similarity between Sturges' character Sir Alfred de Carter, a famous English conductor, and the real-life famous English conductor Sir Thomas Beecham; they warned Sturges to tone down the parallels, but the similarity was noted in some reviews anyway. (Beecham's grandfather was Thomas Beecham, a chemist who invented Beecham's Pills, a laxative. It is speculated that Sturges named his character de Carter after Carter's Little Liver Pills.) Unfaithfully Yours, which had the working titles of \\"Unfinished Symphony\\" and \\"The Symphony Story\\", went into production on February 18, 1948, and wrapped in mid April of that year.TCM Overview By 28 June the film had already been sneak-previewed, with a runtime of 127 minutes, but the film's release was delayed to avoid any backlash from the suicide of actress Carole Landis in July. It was rumored that Landis and Rex Harrison had been having an affair, and that she committed suicide when Harrison refused to get a divorce and marry her. Harrison discovered Landis' body in her home. The film premiered in New York City on November 5, 1948, and went into general release on December 10. The Los Angeles premiere was on December 14. In February 1949, after the film was released, William D. Shapiro, who claimed to be an independent film producer, sued Fox and Sturges with a claim that the story of the film was plagiarized from an unproduced screen story by Arthur Hoerl, which Shapiro had been intending to produce. The connection was supposedly composer Werner Heymann, who frequently worked with Sturges and whom Shapiro had interviewed to be the music director on his film. The studio-quality recorder that cut phonograph records seen in the film is similar to ones used to secretly tape Horowitz and Benny Goodman during their concerts at Carnegie Hall and on the NBC Radio studios at Rockefeller Center. These rough cuts were later mastered into LPs which came to be considered classics. Arthur Rubinstein owned three of these devices. They were difficult to use and required experienced technicians. Reception While rich with the sharp dialogue that became Sturges' trademark, the film was not a box office success. Critics usually attribute this to the darkness of the subject matter, especially for a comedy. The idea of a bungling murderer did not sit well with 1948 audiences, and the fact that none of the characters is especially sympathetic certainly did not help. In 2008, director Quentin Tarantino placed the film at number 8 in his top 11 movies of all time. Sturges, whose previous film, The Sin of Harold Diddlebock had been pulled from distribution shortly after being released, never fully recovered from the lukewarm reception given to Unfaithfully Yours, and many point to it as the movie which effectively ended his career. Despite this, it is considered today by many critics to be an outstanding film, as evidenced by a recent DVD release through the Criterion Collection. Home media The Criterion Company released a DVD of the film, featuring additional audio commentary by Sturges scholars James Harvey, Diane Jacobs, and Brian Henderson. Sturges's fourth (and last) wife \\"Sandy\\" also provides commentary about Sturges and the film. Remake Twentieth Century-Fox remade the film in 1984 under the same title, with Dudley Moore, Nastassja Kinski, Armand Assante and Albert Brooks and directed by Howard Zieff. The remake, however, eliminated the theme of three different pieces of music inspiring three different response or revenge scenarios.

Structure Femoral nerve is the major nerve supplying the anterior compartment of the thigh. It is the largest branch of the lumbar plexus, and arises from the dorsal divisions of the ventral rami of the second, third, and fourth lumbar nerves (L2, L3, and L4). The nerve enters Scarpa's triangle by passing beneath the inguinal ligament, just lateral to the femoral artery. In the thigh, the nerve lies in a groove between iliacus muscle and psoas major muscles, outside the femoral sheath, and lateral to the femoral artery. After a short course of about 4 cm in the thigh, the nerve is divided into anterior and posterior divisions, separated by lateral femoral circumflex artery. The branches are shown below: =Muscular branches= * The nerve to the Pectineus arises immediately above the inguinal ligament from the medial side of the femoral nerve, and passes behind the femoral sheath to enter the anterior surface of the muscle. * Anterior division supplies the Sartorius muscle * Posterior division supplies the rectus femoris, the three vasti (vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, and vastus intermedius), and articularis genus. The articularis genus is supplied by a branch of the nerve to vastus intermedius. =Cutaneous branches= * The anterior division gives off Anterior cutaneous branches: The anterior cutaneous branches are: the intermediate femoral cutaneous nerve and the medial femoral cutaneous nerve. * The posterior division gives off only one branch, which is the saphenous nerve. =Articular branches= * Hip joint is supplied by nerve to the rectus femoris. * Knee joint is supplied by the nerves to the three vasti. The nerve to vastus medialis is particularly thick because it contains the proprioceptive fibres from the knee joint. This is in accordance to the Hilton's law. =Vascular branches= * Branches to the femoral artery and its branches. Clinical significance Signals from the femoral nerve and its branches can be blocked to interrupt transmission of pain signal from the innervation area, by performing a regional nerve blockage. Some of the nerve blocks that works by affecting the femoral nerve are; femoral nerve block, fascia iliac block and 3-in-1 nerve block.

The movie takes its title and basic plot from Fyodor Dostoevsky‚Äôs 1848 short story White Nights. Plot A lonely young man, Mario, meets a lonely young woman, Natalia. Mario (Marcello Mastroianni) is lonely for social reasons; he is a stranger and a newcomer to town. Natalia (Maria Schell) is lonely because she has always lived in isolation, even in the heart of the city. Her loneliness is intensified because she is in love with a man (Jean Marais) who may not ever return to her, but who continues to occupy her heart to the exclusion of any other possible relationship. In turning the Dostoevsky story into a film, Visconti eliminated the first-person narration and made Natalia less of an innocent, and at times something of a hysteric and a tease. For his part, Mario rejects obvious offers of romantic attention from other women in the story, holding on to a fruitless obsession. Mario thanks the young woman for the moment of happiness she has brought him. However, he is left alone at the end of the film, befriending the same stray dog he met at the beginning. He is back at square one, and has put more energy into pursuing the fantasy of an obsession rather than any prospect of real love. Cast *Maria Schell ... Natalia *Marcello Mastroianni ...

The medial surfaces form the upper part of the lateral wall to the third ventricle. In humans it is only about one centimeter long, though in females it is larger by about 50%.Wiley Interscience Sometimes it is in two parts and 20% of the time it is absent. In other mammals it is larger. In 1889, a Portuguese anatomist by the name of Macedo examined 215 brains, showing that male humans are approximately twice as likely to lack an interthalamic adhesion as are female humans. He also reported its absence, still reported today at about 20 per cent. Its absence is seen to be of no consequence. The interthalamic adhesion contains nerve cells and nerve fibers; a few of the latter may cross the middle line, but most of them pass toward the middle line and then curve laterally on the same side. It is still uncertain whether the interthalamic adhesion contains fibers that cross the mid-line and for this reason it is inappropriate to call it a commissure.

Kings Highway is a broad avenue that curves about southern part of the Borough of Brooklyn in New York City. Its west end is at Bay Parkway and 78th Street. East of Ocean Avenue, the street is largely residential. It tracks eastward, then northeast, then north through Brooklyn and reaches East 98th Street in central Brooklyn. At that point, it flows into Howard Avenue to provide seamless access to Eastern Parkway, another major road in Brooklyn with side medians and service roads. A Business Improvement District has been established along part of the road to support stores, restaurants and businesses in that area.\\"Kings Highway Business Improvement District\\", Sheepshead Bites History Kings Highway entering the Flatlands section of Brooklyn Originally an Indian trail, the strip was known as \\"Mechawanienck\\" or \\"the ancient pathway\\", a name recorded in a 1652 deed. It was later known as the \\"wagon path\\" in a 1682 deed. Although not entirely built in 1704, \\"King's Highway\\" was formed in colonial New York when the locals connected the many smaller established roads, cow paths, and Indian trails that passed through Kings County. They named the highway after the county, which was named in honor of King Charles II of England on November 1, 1683. =Original route= Originally, Kings Highway was much longer than it is now. It began at Brooklyn Ferry, now called Fulton Ferry, where Ferry Road, now called Old Fulton Street and Furman Street, ran southeastward to the small Dutch town of New Amersfoort, now known as Flatlands. It took a sharp westward turn at that point and passed into another of Brooklyn's original six towns, New Utrecht. It led into Yellow Hook (Bay Ridge), ending at Denyse's Ferry, operated by a colonial-era landowner, about where Shore Road and 86th Street meet today. In southwest Brooklyn, the thoroughfare had other names, including: \\"State Road,\\" \\"Road from Fort Hamilton to New Utrecht,\\" and \\"Road from New Utrecht to Denyse's Ferry.\\" Route description Kings Highway at Coney Island Avenue (1977) According to the Dyker Heights Historical Society, the Highway ended at the ferry landing in what is now Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn. In 1740 Denyse, a local New Utrecht resident, took over ferry operations in The Narrows, serving Brooklyn and Staten Island. Denyse‚Äôs Ferry was located at the base of the hill on which Fort Hamilton was built, near today‚Äôs Fort Hamilton Parkway and Shore Road. Kings Highway traveled northeast from Denyse‚Äôs Ferry to present-day 86th Street. This portion of the Highway is known today as Fort Hamilton Parkway. At the corner of Kings Highway and 86th Street stood New Utrecht Town Hall, built in 1878 (demolished in 1912). This building was also used as a school, police station, and jail. Kings Highway traveled northeast, at about a 40-degree angle to the street grid, until it reached the middle of 81st Street between Eleventh and Twelfth Avenues. At the intersection of the current-day 81st Street and Eleventh Avenue, Denyse‚Äôs Lane branched off in a northwardly direction. St. Phillips Church in Dyker Heights now occupies part of the former lane, which meandered down to Van Brunt‚Äôs Dock in Bay Ridge. Closer to Bay Ridge, Denyse‚Äôs Lane was known as Van Brunt‚Äôs Lane, today's 79th Street. The highest natural point in southwestern Brooklyn is at Eleventh Avenue and 82nd Street, at Dyker Heights. During the time of Kings Highway, the hill was known as New Utrecht Mount. According to the Brooklyn Eagle, it gave ‚Äúthe soldiers of revolutionary time an outlook from which they could note the movements of their opponents, not only as they approached from the sea, but maneuvered on Staten Island.‚Äù At 81st Street and Twelfth Avenue was Flax Pond. This site was filled in and developed; it is now occupied by Junior High School (JHS) 201. After the pond, Kings Highway traveled southeast until it reached Waters Avenue, which ran between Thirteenth and Fourteenth avenues from 83rd Street until it reached the Dyker Meadows. At Fourteenth Avenue, Kings Highway meandered around the northern limits of the Dyker Meadows Swamp, which occupied much of the block between Fourteenth and Fifteenth avenues between 83rd and 84th streets. From Sixteenth Avenue to Eighteenth Avenue, Kings Highway ran on a slight diagonal; this section appears in today‚Äôs street grid as 84th Street. At Sixteenth Avenue is the cemetery where the original New Utrecht Reformed Church of 1700 stood. At Eighteenth Avenue is the church of 1828. At this 1828 church, the Highway made an abrupt 90 degree leftward turn and traveled northward one and a half blocks (as part of today‚Äôs Eighteenth Avenue) until it made another abrupt 90 degree turn, this time eastward. It was built around the Van Pelt Manor House of 1686. In 1741 a Milestone was placed in front of the home to indicate the distances to New York City ( miles), to Denyse‚Äôs Ferry ( miles), and to Jamaica, Queens (15 miles). Kings Highway continued east into the Town of Gravesend, Brooklyn. According to the Brooklyn Eagle, in the 19th century, Kings Highway ‚Äúwas one of the best and most convenient thoroughfares for the lovers of riding and driving.‚Äù The British General Lord Cornwallis traveled along the road with his troops on August 26, 1776, to the Battle of Brooklyn. He achieved a major defeat for the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War. When President George Washington came to survey the agricultural abilities of Kings, Queens, and Suffolk counties after the war in 1792, he traveled down this rural road. Gradually, farmers moved into the area and developed their homesteads along the road. =Naming= Commercial section of Kings Highway Though the road was the major highway running through the towns of Brooklyn, Flatbush, Flatlands, Gravesend and New Utrecht, it did not have a commonly used name until the 19th century, when the portion from Brooklyn Ferry to Flatbush came to be called Flatbush Road, now Flatbush Avenue. It was often referred to simply as ‚Äúlane‚Äù or ‚Äúroad,‚Äù followed by a short description. Thus it would be described as ‚Äúthe lane between Gravesend and New Utrecht.‚Äù It also took on local names in each town, such as ‚ÄúGravesend Lane‚Äù and ‚ÄúFerry Road.‚Äù The name ‚ÄúKings Highway‚Äù was a common reference to public highways during colonial times and has been used for other roads around the New York City area that are in no way connected with the present Kings Highway. =1922 alteration= Despite its long history and importance as a connection through the borough of Brooklyn, in the early 1920s local city planners proposed to have the street demapped as part of an effort to regularize the street grid. Instead, it was widened in 1922, east of Ocean Avenue where park malls were created. The route was altered to straighten as many sections as possible, and to make it easy for vehicle traffic. Following the example of the parkways designed by Frederick Law Olmsted (1822‚Äì1903), who designed the Eastern and Ocean parkways, the boulevard malls were planted with trees to separate local and through traffic along the street. Unlike Olmsted‚Äôs parkways, however, the Kings Highway malls are much narrower because existing development constrained their size; they do not provide the leisurely promenades that characterize Olmsted‚Äôs work. Transportation Kings Highway station (BMT Brighton Line), early 1980s The B7, B82/B82 SBS, and B100 buses all run along Kings Highway.

Neo offers this explanation of the band's name: \\"Still no agreement on a band name until Maati [Stojanovich, Neo's girlfriend] sees a graffiti on a sidewalk in the Tenderloin reading 'XTAL.' No one hates it; it grows on you. Somewhere along the line a hyphen is added to make it easier to pronounce, but for the next 13 years, confusion ensues as to whether the letter 't' is capitalized. (It's not.)\\"http://www.jneomarvin.com/index2.html The trio's first two gigs were at San Francisco's On Broadway in late 1983. The band put out a demo in 1984, then broke up in 1985, with band members moving on to other projects. When two songs from X-tal's demo were included on the 1987 SF Unscene compilation and attracted some attention, Neo and Freeman reformed the band, eventually settling on a lineup with Mitzi Waltz on bass and Jimmy (Demetrius) Broustis on guitar. (Broustis hails from Libertyville, Illinois, a small town that produced a number of alternative music figures; Broustis was in the same class at Libertyville High School as Adam Jones of Tool.) This lineup played frequently at San Francisco's Albion, and released X-tal's first album, Reason Is 6/7 of Treason, in 1990. The CMJ New Music Report said the record \\"scoops up the morning-dew innocence of the least embarrassing Haight-Ashbury petal- babies of the \`60s with the world-bleary wisdom of all those SF/LA punk-worn people who turned their matured underground gaze upon gentler, more introspective directions.\\"CMJ New Music Report, March 30, 1990 With Allison Moseley replacing Waltz on bass, X-tal recorded Die Monster Die, released in 1991. This second album was called \\"wiser and angrier\\" by CMJ, which deemed it \\"first-class world punk music.\\"CMJ New Music Report, March 29, 1991 The disc's more political songs included \\"An Old Colonial's Hard Luck Story\\" (the band's only single), about the self-pity of Rhodesian exiles, and \\"Domino's Theory,\\" a six-minute protest song tying together Domino's Pizza's labor policies and food quality to CEO Tom Monaghan's alleged support for the Nicaraguan Contras and Operation Rescue: :A fortune made on cardboard crust :Is a gun pointed at our subversive lust :And a Midwest multi-millionaire :Can finance right-wing guerrilla warfare :Anywhere The same band members, with guest Carrie Bradley of Ed's Redeeming Qualities, produced 1992's Everything Crash, which Allmusic called \\"an excellent album that makes the brain dance.\\" The Voice's Marcus cited the Fairport Convention cover \\"Genesis Hall\\" (featuring Moseley on vocals) and \\"Neo's despair-hate-grief-and-rage cocktail 'Black Russian'\\" as \\"much better than good.\\"Marcus, p. 102. https://books.google.com/books?id=0XWhCgAAQBAJ&lpg;=PA585&dq;=x-tal%20Marcus&pg;=PA102#v=onepage&q;=x-tal%20&f;=false After this release, Broustis left the group, eventually replaced by Mark Zanandrea. The two albums recorded with Zanandrea were released in Germany, where the band had a considerable following. In 1996, the last incarnation of X-tal broke up. In 2006, they played a well-attended reunion concert in San Francisco. Associated bands There was a proto-version of X-tal that went by various names, including PDR, that included Neo and Alan Korn, along with Annie Hesse or Maati Stojanovich and a series of drummers. Neo considers the first real X-tal lineup to be the one with Mick Freeman. When the first lineup of X-tal broke up, Korn formed a band called The Cat Heads with singer/guitarist Mark Zanandrea, who played guitar in the latter days of X-tal. Zanandrea had released the above-mentioned SF Unscene compilation. The Catheads also included guitarist Sam Babbitt and drummer-singer Melanie Clarin. Between the first and second incarnations of X-tal, a band called God and His Dog (described by Neo as having \\"the impossible ambition to be a cross between the Pogues and Sonic Youth\\") was formed by Neo, Freeman, Stojanovich, Patty Stirling, and Jeremy O'Doughaill (formerly of the band Honor Role). Several songs written for God and His Dog ended up on X-tal and Cat Heads albums. Jeremy O'Doughaill went on to be in a band called the Bedlam Rovers with two future members of X-tal's final lineup: drummer Theo Denaxas and violinist/accordionist Morgan Fichter. After leaving X-tal, Broustis played with the bands Strawman and Shotwell. Neo's post-X-tal vehicles are J Neo Marvin and the Content Providers, the Experimental Bunnies, and the Granite Countertops.

Waistlines rose through the period for both men and women. Other notable fashions included full, slashed sleeves and tall or broad hats with brims. For men, hose disappeared in favour of breeches. Rubens with his first wife c. 1610. Her long, rounded stomacher and jacket-like bodice are characteristic Dutch fashions The silhouette, which was essentially close to the body with tight sleeves and a low, pointed waist to around 1615, gradually softened and broadened. Sleeves became very full, and in the 1620s and 1630s were often paned or slashed to show the voluminous sleeves of the shirt or chemise beneath. Spanish fashions remained very conservative. The ruff lingered longest in Spain and the Netherlands, but disappeared first for men and later for women in France and England. The social tensions leading to the English Civil War were reflected in English fashion, with the elaborate French styles popular at the courts of James I and his son Charles I contrasting with the sober styles in sadd colours favoured by Puritans and exported to the early settlements of New England (see below). In the early decades of the century, a trend among poets and artists to adopt a fashionable pose of melancholia is reflected in fashion, where the characteristic touches are dark colours, open collars, unbuttoned robes or doublets, and a generally disheveled appearance, accompanied in portraits by world-weary poses and sad expressions. Fashions influenced by royal courts =Fabric and patterns= Scrolling floral embroidery decorates this Englishwoman's dress, petticoat, and linen jacket, accented with blue-tinted reticella collar, cuffs, and headdress, c. 1614‚Äì18. Figured silks with elaborate pomegranate or artichoke patterns are still seen in this period, especially in Spain, but a lighter style of scrolling floral motifs, woven or embroidered, was popular, especially in England. The great flowering of needlelace occurred in this period. Geometric reticella deriving from cutwork was elaborated into true needlelace or punto in aria (called in England \\"point lace\\"), which also reflected the popular scrolling floral designs. Kliot, Jules and Kaethe: The Needle-Made Lace of Reticella.Montupet, Janine, and Ghislaine Schoeller: Lace: The Elegant Web In England, embroidered linen silk jackets fastened with ribbon ties were fashionable for both men and women from c. 1600‚Äì1620, as was reticella tinted with yellow starch. Overgowns with split sleeves (often trimmed with horizontal rows of braid) were worn by both men and women. From the 1620s, surface ornament fell out of fashion in favour of solid-colour satins, and functional ribbon bows or points became elaborate masses of rosettes and looped trim. =Portraiture and fantasy= In England from the 1630s, under the influence of literature and especially court masques, Anthony van Dyck and his followers created a fashion for having one's portrait painted in exotic, historical or pastoral dress, or in simplified contemporary fashion with various scarves, cloaks, mantles, and jewels added to evoke a classic or romantic mood, and also to prevent the portrait appearing dated within a few years. These paintings are the progenitors of the fashion of the later 17th century for having one's portrait painted in undress, and do not necessarily reflect clothing as it was actually worn.See and Women's fashions Elizabeth Poulett wears a low rounded neckline and a small ruff paired with a winged collar.

She wears a ribbon sash. C. 1632‚Äì1635. Helena Fourment in the hairstyle and neckline of c. 1630 =Gowns, bodices, and petticoats= In the early years of the new century, fashionable bodices had high necklines or extremely low, rounded necklines, and short wings at the shoulders. Separate closed cartwheel ruffs were sometimes worn, with the standing collar, supported by a small wire frame or supportasse used for more casual wear and becoming more common later. Long sleeves were worn with deep cuffs to match the ruff. The cartwheel ruff disappeared in fashionable England by 1613.See Costume notes to portrait of Mary Radclyffe, Denver Museum of Art By the mid-1620s, styles were relaxing. Ruffs were discarded in favor of wired collars which were called rebatos in continental Europe and, later, wide, flat collars. By the 1630s and 1640s, collars were accompanied by kerchiefs similar to the linen kerchiefs worn by middle-class women in the previous century; often the collar and kerchief were trimmed with matching lace. Bodices were long-waisted at the beginning of the century, but waistlines rose steadily to the mid-1630s before beginning to drop again. In the second decade of the 17th century, short tabs developed attached to the bottom of the bodice covering the bum-roll which supported the skirts. These tabs grew longer during the 1620s and were worn with a stomacher which filled the gap between the two front edges of the bodice. By 1640, the long tabs had almost disappeared and a longer, smoother figure became fashionable: The waist returned to normal height at the back and sides with a low point at the front. The long, tight sleeves of the early 17th century grew shorter, fuller, and looser. A common style of the 1620s and 1630s was the virago sleeve, a full, slashed sleeve gathered into two puffs by a ribbon or other trim above the elbow. In France and England, lightweight bright or pastel-coloured satins replaced dark, heavy fabrics. As in other periods, painters tended to avoid the difficulty of painting striped fabrics; it is clear from inventories that these were common.Marieke de Winkel in:Rudi Ekkart and Quentin Buvelot (eds), Dutch Portraits, The Age of Rembrandt and Frans Hals, Mauritshuis/National Gallery/Waanders Publishers, Zwolle, p.73, 2007, Short strings of pearls were fashionable. Unfitted gowns (called nightgowns in England) with long hanging sleeves, short open sleeves, or no sleeves at all were worn over the bodice and skirt and tied with a ribbon sash at the waist. In England of the 1610s and 1620s, a loose nightgown was often worn over an embroidered jacket called a waistcoat and a contrasting embroidered petticoat, without a farthingale.See Aileen Ribeiro, Fashion and Fiction: Dress in Art and Literature in Stuart England Black gowns were worn for the most formal occasions; they fell out of fashion in England in the 1630s in favour of gowns to match the bodice and petticoat, but remained an important item of clothing on the Continent. At least in the Netherlands the open-fronted overgown or vlieger was strictly reserved for married women. Before marriage the bouwen, \\"a dress with a fitted bodice and a skirt that was closed all round\\" was worn instead; it was known in England as a \\"Dutch\\" or \\"round gown\\".Marieke de Winkel in:Rudi Ekkart and Quentin Buvelot (eds), Dutch Portraits, The Age of Rembrandt and Frans Hals, Mauritshuis/National Gallery/Waanders Publishers, Zwolle, p.67, 2007, Skirts might be open in front to reveal an underskirt or petticoat until about 1630, or closed all around; closed skirts were sometimes carried or worn looped up to reveal a petticoat. Corsets were shorter to suit the new bodices, and might have a very stiff busk in the center front extending to the depth of the stomacher. Skirts were held in the proper shape by a padded roll or French farthingale holding the skirts out in a rounded shape at the waist, falling in soft folds to the floor. The drum or wheel farthingale was worn at the English court until the death of Anne of Denmark in 1619. =Hairstyles and headdresses= To about 1613, hair was worn feathered high over the forehead. Married women wore their hair in a linen coif or cap, often with lace trim. Tall hats like those worn by men were adopted for outdoor wear. In a characteristic style of 1625‚Äì1650, hair was worn in loose waves to the shoulders on the sides, with the rest of the hair gathered or braided into a high bun at the back of the head. A short fringe or bangs might be worn with this style. Very fashionable married women abandoned the linen cap and wore their hair uncovered or with a hat. =Style gallery 1600‚Äì1620= Image:Nicholas Hilliard 012.jpg1 ‚Äì 1602 Image:Anne of Denmark-1605.jpg2 ‚Äì 1605 Image:Isabella Rubens.jpg3 ‚Äì 1609 Image:Mary Radclyffe by William Larkin.jpg4 ‚Äì 1610s Image:Anne of Denmark in mourning.jpg5 ‚Äì 1612 Image:Larkin cary.jpg6 ‚Äì 1614‚Äì18 Image:Frans Hals 045.jpg7 ‚Äì 1618‚Äì20 Image:Elizabeth style 1620.jpg8 c. 1620 # Hilliard's Unknown Woman of 1602 wears typical Puritan fashion of the early years of the century.

Shirt sleeves became fuller throughout the period. To the 1620s, a collar wired to stick out horizontally, called a whisk, was popular. Other styles included an unstarched ruff-like collar and, later, a rectangular falling band lying on the shoulders. Pointed Van Dyke beards, named after the painter Anthony van Dyck, were fashionable, and men often grew a large, wide moustache, as well. Doublets were pointed and fitted close to the body, with tight sleeves, to about 1615. Gradually waistlines rose and sleeves became fuller, and both body and upper sleeves might be slashed to show the shirt beneath. By 1640, doublets were full and unfitted, and might be open at the front below the high waist to show the shirt. Sleeveless leather jerkins were worn by soldiers and are seen in portraits, but otherwise the jerkin rapidly fell out of fashion for indoor wear. =Hose and breeches= G Paned or pansied trunk hose or round hose, padded hose with strips of fabric (panes) over a full inner layer or lining, were worn early in the period, over cannions, fitted hose that ended above the knee. Trunk hose were longer than in the previous period, and were pear-shaped, with less fullness at the waist and more at mid-thigh. Slops or galligaskins, loose hose reaching just below the knee, replaced all other styles of hose by the 1620s, and were now generally called breeches. Breeches might be fastened up the outer leg with buttons or buckles over a full lining. From 1600 to c. 1630, hose or breeches were fastened to doublets by means of ties or points, short laces or ribbons pulled through matching sets of worked eyelets. Points were tied in bows at the waist and became more elaborate until they disappeared with the very short waisted doublets of the late 1630s. Decorated metal tips on points were called aiguillettes or aiglets, and those of the wealthy were made of precious metals set with pearls and other gemstones.Scarisbrick, Diana, Tudor and Jacobean Jewellery, pp. 99‚Äì100 Spanish breeches, rather stiff ungathered breeches, were also popular throughout the era. =Outerwear= Gowns were worn early in the period, but fell out of fashion in the 1620s. Short cloaks or capes, usually hip-length, often with sleeves, were worn by fashionable men, usually slung artistically over the left shoulder, even indoors; a fashion of the 1630s matched the cape fabric to the breeches and its lining to the doublet. Long cloaks were worn for inclement weather. =Hairstyles and Headgear= Early in the period, hair was worn collar-length and brushed back from the forehead; very fashionable men wore a single long strand of hair called a lovelock over one shoulder. Hairstyles grew longer through the period, and long curls were fashionable by the late 1630s and 1640s, pointing toward the ascendance of the wig in the 1660s. Pointed beards and wide mustaches were fashionable. To about 1620, the fashionable hat was the capotain, with a tall conical crown rounded at the top and a narrow brim. By the 1630s, the crown was shorter and the brim was wider, often worn cocked or pinned up on one side and decorated with a mass of ostrich plumes. Close- fitting caps called coifs or biggins were worn only by young children and old men under their hats or alone indoors. =Style gallery 1600s‚Äì1620s= Image:JamesIEngland.jpg1 ‚Äì 1603-10 Image:Henry prince of wales.jpg2 ‚Äì 1606‚Äì09 Image:Peter saltonstall 1610.jpg 3 ‚Äì c. 1610 Image:RSackville.jpg4 ‚Äì 1613 File:Nathan Field.JPG5 - 1615 File:Dani√´l Mijtens - Portrait of James Hamilton, Earl of Arran, Later 3rd Marquis and 1st Duke of Hamilton, Aged 17 - Google Art Project.jpg6 ‚Äì 1623 Image:Carlos de Austria, infante de Espa√±a.jpg7 ‚Äì 1628 Image:Charles 1 Mijtens.jpg8 ‚Äì 1629 Image:Gustav II Adolf portr√§tterad av Jakob Elbfas ca 1630.jpg9 - 1630 # James VI and I, 1603‚Äì1610, wears a satin doublet, wired whisk, short cape, and hose over cannions.

Footwear Heeled shoes with shoe roses Boots with boothose, early (left) and late (right) 1630s Flat shoes were worn to around 1610, when a low heel became popular. The ribbon tie over the instep that had appeared on late sixteenth century shoes grew into elaborate lace or ribbon rosettes called shoe roses that were worn by the most fashionable men and women. Backless slippers called pantofles were worn indoors. By the 1620s, heeled boots became popular for indoor as well as outdoor wear. The boots themselves were usually turned down below the knee; boot tops became wider until the \\"bucket-top\\" boot associated with The Three Musketeers appeared in the 1630s. Spurs straps featured decorative butterfly-shaped spur leathers over the instep. Wooden clogs or pattens were worn outdoors over shoes and boots to keep the high heels from sinking into soft dirt. Stockings had elaborate clocks or embroidery at the ankles early in the period. Boothose of stout linen were worn under boots to protect fine knitted stockings; these could be trimmed with lace. Children's fashion Toddler boys wore gowns or skirts and doublets until they were breeched.

Louis XIII of France issued sumptuary laws in 1629 and 1633 that prohibited lace, gold trim and lavish embroidery for all but the highest nobility and restricting puffs, slashes and bunches of ribbon.K√µhler, Carl: A History of Costume, p. 289 The effects of this reform effort are depicted in a series of popular engravings by Abraham Bosse.Lef√©bure, Ernest: Embroidery and Lace: Their Manufacture and History from the Remotest Antiquity to the Present Day, p.230 =Puritan dress= Pilgrims Going to Church by George Henry Boughton (1867) Puritans advocated a conservative form of fashionable attire, characterized by sadd colors and modest cuts. Gowns with low necklines were filled in with high- necked smocks and wide collars. Married women covered their hair with a linen cap, over which they might wear a tall black hat. Men and women avoided bright colours, shiny fabrics and over-ornamentation. Contrary to popular belief, most Puritans and Calvinists did not wear black for everyday, especially in England, Scotland and colonial America. Black dye was expensive, faded quickly and black clothing was reserved for the most formal occasions (including having one's portrait painted), for elders in a community and for those of higher rank. Richer puritans, like their Dutch Calvinist contemporaries, probably did wear it often but in silk, often patterned. Typical colours for most were brown, murrey (mulberry, a brownish-maroon), dull greens and tawny colours. Wool and linen were preferred over silks and satins, though Puritan women of rank wore modest amounts of lace and embroidery as appropriate to their station, believing that the various ranks of society were divinely ordained and should be reflected even in the most modest dress. William Perkins wrote \\"...that apparel is necessary for Scholar, the Tradesman, the Countryman, the Gentleman; which serveth not only to defend their bodies from cold, but which belongs also to the place, degree, calling, and condition of them all\\" (Cases of Conscience, 1616).See Cases of Conscience, 1616 Some Puritans rejected the long, curled hair as effeminate and favoured a shorter fashion which led to the nickname Roundheads for adherents of the English Parliamentary party but the taste for lavish or simple dress cut across both parties in the English Civil War.Ribeiro, Aileen: Dress and Morality, Berg Publishers 2003, , pp. 12‚Äì16 Working class clothing Image:Pieter Bruegel d.

Plot In an impoverished and burnt out Tokyo ghetto of post- World War II Japan, a band of prostitutes defend their territory, squatting in a bombed-out building. Somehow they eke out a living together. Forming a sort of family in an environment where everyone (American soldiers and Japanese yakuza) is a potential antagonist, the girls cajole each other, and ruthlessly punish any of their group who violate the cardinal rule‚Äîno having sex for free. A new girl, Maya (Yumiko Nogawa), joins their group and learns the trade. An ex-soldier, Shintaro Ibuki (Joe Shishido), is shot nearby and holes up with the girls. Each of them starts to crave Ibuki, placing strains on the group. Maya feels it worse, seeing him as replacement for her brother (who died in Borneo). She takes him after a night of drunken revelry, and both are ostracized. Agreeing to run away together, he is shot in a double-cross, and she is left as she was at the beginning of the film‚Äîalone and hopeless. Production A conceptual sketch by production designer Takeo Kimura for Gate of Flesh (1964). Planned as an \\"adult release\\" (Japanese films were classified by the country's film board as \\"general release\\" or \\"adult\\"), the usual pace of production at Nikkatsu (10 days pre-production, 25 days shooting, three days post-production) allowed Suzuki and his innovative production designer Takeo Kimura precious little time to construct sets to recreate post-war firebombed Tokyo. Sets were slapped together on the backlot using materials purloined from studio warehouses, and theatrical set design techniques which could compromise the film's \\"realism.\\" The resulting production has been lauded for its resulting visual flair. Most female actresses at Nikkatsu refused to work in the film due to the nudity and subject matter, so the cast's female roles were filled by actresses from outside the studio.

It is based on a story by Taijiro Tamura who, like Suzuki, had served as a soldier in the war. Plot Disappointed by the marriage of her lover to a woman he does not love, prostitute Harumi drifts from the city to a remote Japanese outpost in Manchuria to work in a \\"comfort house,\\" or brothel, during the Sino-Japanese war. The commanding adjutant there takes an immediate liking to the new girl, but she is at first fascinated, and comes to love, Mikami, the officer's aide. At first he is haughty and indifferent to the girl, which enrages her, but they are drawn together eventually. Abused and manipulated by the adjutant, she grows to hate the officer and seeks solace in Mikami's arms. They carry on a clandestine affair, which is a dangerous breach of code for both of them. Tragedy strikes when the Chinese attack the outpost, and Mikami is severely wounded in a trench. Harumi runs to him and they are both captured by the enemy while he is unconscious. The Chinese dress his wounds and he is given the opportunity to withdraw with them; but as a Japanese soldier, he is bound by a code not to be captured at all, and only Harumi's intervention prevents him from killing himself. Once again in the custody of the Japanese, Harumi is sent back to the brothel, and Mikami is to be court-martialed and executed in disgrace. During another attack on the outpost, he escapes with Harumi's aid, but instead of fleeing with her, he intends to blow himself up to clear his and his battalion's honor. She leaps on his body and they die together. Cast * Yumiko Nogawa as Harumi * Tamio Kawachi as Pvt. Shinkichi Mikami * Isao Tamagawa as Lt. Narita * Shoichi Ozawa as Sgt. Akiyama Production In 1950, Tamura's story was made into a more romantic film, Escape at Dawn, co- written by Akira Kurosawa and directed by Senkichi Taniguchi. For the Nikkatsu adaptation, Suzuki drew upon his firsthand experience at the wartime front to portray the conditions and behavior in a more realistic light. What was presented in the film and the actual conditions \\"probably aren't that different,\\" Suzuki said in a 2005 interview. Most Japanese war movies portrayed the era with healthy doses of tragedy, but Suzuki infused an air of ludicrousness in his film. His own opinion of the wartime military experience was that beside the brutality, it was \\"extremely comical and absurd.\\" Suzuki could not film on location in China, so studio sets and lookalike locations in Japan were used. Reception At this time, Suzuki was at regular odds with Nikkatsu, his studio. He would be given a project and expected to direct it in workmanlike fashion, but he consistently introduced stylistic nuances and levels of realism that the studio resented. Suzuki didn't at first get critical attention as a \\"B-movie director.\\" By 1965, some critics began to take note of his style, but this film had very mixed reviews, mostly disappointing. In this case, the first version of Tamura's story was chaste (the girls were \\"entertainers,\\" not \\"comfort women\\") and romantically inclined, and Suzuki portrayed a far more realistic portrait of the ugly side of Japanese military life. Critic Tadao Sato noted that most films portray the very meditative and serene traditions that Japanese are known for, but Suzuki also dramatizes \\"another tradition that is the complete opposite ... very disorderly and grotesque.\\" This and the realistic onscreen depiction of sexuality and sadism didn't win over audiences.

After a brief tour in the army during World War I, he began acting in various theatrical productions in Berlin, Vienna, and other cities in Central Europe. He began his film career in 1921, and appeared in a number of German silent films early on. Sima was frequently cast as the comic villain whose machinations get everyone into trouble, although often his villainous stature was used to more chilling effect. In 1929, Sima married actress Lina Woiwode. The couple remained married until Sima's death.

The field was pioneered by Richard R. Ernst and Kurt W√ºthrich at the ETH, and by Ad Bax, Marius Clore, Angela Gronenborn at the NIH,, and Gerhard Wagner at Harvard University, among others. Structure determination by NMR spectroscopy usually consists of several phases, each using a separate set of highly specialized techniques. The sample is prepared, measurements are made, interpretive approaches are applied, and a structure is calculated and validated. NMR involves the quantum mechanical properties of the central core (\\"nucleus\\") of the atom. These properties depend on the local molecular environment, and their measurement provides a map of how the atoms are linked chemically, how close they are in space, and how rapidly they move with respect to each other. These properties are fundamentally the same as those used in the more familiar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), but the molecular applications use a somewhat different approach, appropriate to the change of scale from millimeters (of interest to radiologists) to nanometers (bonded atoms are typically a fraction of a nanometer apart), a factor of a million. This change of scale requires much higher sensitivity of detection and stability for long term measurement. In contrast to MRI, structural biology studies do not directly generate an image, but rely on complex computer calculations to generate three-dimensional molecular models. Currently most samples are examined in a solution in water, but methods are being developed to also work with solid samples. Data collection relies on placing the sample inside a powerful magnet, sending radio frequency signals through the sample, and measuring the absorption of those signals. Depending on the environment of atoms within the protein, the nuclei of individual atoms will absorb different frequencies of radio signals. Furthermore, the absorption signals of different nuclei may be perturbed by adjacent nuclei. This information can be used to determine the distance between nuclei. These distances in turn can be used to determine the overall structure of the protein. A typical study might involve how two proteins interact with each other, possibly with a view to developing small molecules that can be used to probe the normal biology of the interaction (\\"chemical biology\\") or to provide possible leads for pharmaceutical use (drug development). Frequently, the interacting pair of proteins may have been identified by studies of human genetics, indicating the interaction can be disrupted by unfavorable mutations, or they may play a key role in the normal biology of a \\"model\\" organism like the fruit fly, yeast, the worm C. elegans, or mice. To prepare a sample, methods of molecular biology are typically used to make quantities by bacterial fermentation. This also permits changing the isotopic composition of the molecule, which is desirable because the isotopes behave differently and provide methods for identifying overlapping NMR signals. Sample preparation tube. Protein nuclear magnetic resonance is performed on aqueous samples of highly purified protein. Usually, the sample consists of between 300 and 600 microlitres with a protein concentration in the range 0.1 ‚Äì 3 millimolar. The source of the protein can be either natural or produced in a production system using recombinant DNA techniques through genetic engineering. Recombinantly expressed proteins are usually easier to produce in sufficient quantity, and this method makes isotopic labeling possible. The purified protein is usually dissolved in a buffer solution and adjusted to the desired solvent conditions. The NMR sample is prepared in a thin-walled glass tube. Data collection Protein NMR utilizes multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance experiments to obtain information about the protein. Ideally, each distinct nucleus in the molecule experiences a distinct electronic environment and thus has a distinct chemical shift by which it can be recognized. However, in large molecules such as proteins the number of resonances can typically be several thousand and a one-dimensional spectrum inevitably has incidental overlaps. Therefore, multidimensional experiments that correlate the frequencies of distinct nuclei are performed. The additional dimensions decrease the chance of overlap and have a larger information content, since they correlate signals from nuclei within a specific part of the molecule. Magnetization is transferred into the sample using pulses of electromagnetic (radiofrequency) energy and between nuclei using delays; the process is described with so-called pulse sequences. Pulse sequences allow the experimenter to investigate and select specific types of connections between nuclei. The array of nuclear magnetic resonance experiments used on proteins fall in two main categories ‚Äî one where magnetization is transferred through the chemical bonds, and one where the transfer is through space, irrespective of the bonding structure. The first category is used to assign the different chemical shifts to a specific nucleus, and the second is primarily used to generate the distance restraints used in the structure calculation, and in the assignment with unlabelled protein. Depending on the concentration of the sample, on the magnetic field of the spectrometer, and on the type of experiment, a single multidimensional nuclear magnetic resonance experiment on a protein sample may take hours or even several days to obtain suitable signal-to-noise ratio through signal averaging, and to allow for sufficient evolution of magnetization transfer through the various dimensions of the experiment. Other things being equal, higher-dimensional experiments will take longer than lower-dimensional experiments. Typically, the first experiment to be measured with an isotope- labelled protein is a 2D heteronuclear single quantum correlation (HSQC) spectrum, where \\"heteronuclear\\" refers to nuclei other than 1H. In theory, the heteronuclear single quantum correlation has one peak for each H bound to a heteronucleus. Thus, in the 15N-HSQC, with a 15N labelled protein, one signal is expected for each nitrogen atom in the back bone, with the exception of proline, which has no amide-hydrogen due to the cyclic nature of its backbone. Additional 15N-HSQC signals are contributed by each residue with a nitrogen- hydrogen bond in its side chain (W, N, Q, R, H, K). The 15N-HSQC is often referred to as the fingerprint of a protein because each protein has a unique pattern of signal positions. Analysis of the 15N-HSQC allows researchers to evaluate whether the expected number of peaks is present and thus to identify possible problems due to multiple conformations or sample heterogeneity. The relatively quick heteronuclear single quantum correlation experiment helps determine the feasibility of doing subsequent longer, more expensive, and more elaborate experiments. It is not possible to assign peaks to specific atoms from the heteronuclear single quantum correlation alone. Resonance assignment In order to analyze the nuclear magnetic resonance data, it is important to get a resonance assignment for the protein, that is to find out which chemical shift corresponds to which atom. This is typically achieved by sequential walking using information derived from several different types of NMR experiment. The exact procedure depends on whether the protein is isotopically labelled or not, since a lot of the assignment experiments depend on carbon-13 and nitrogen-15. Comparison of a COSY and TOCSY 2D spectra for an amino acid like glutamate or methionine. The TOCSY shows off diagonal crosspeaks between all protons in the spectrum, but the COSY only has crosspeaks between neighbours. =Homonuclear nuclear magnetic resonance= With unlabelled protein the usual procedure is to record a set of two dimensional homonuclear nuclear magnetic resonance experiments through correlation spectroscopy (COSY), of which several types include conventional correlation spectroscopy, total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY). A two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance experiment produces a two-dimensional spectrum. The units of both axes are chemical shifts. The COSY and TOCSY transfer magnetization through the chemical bonds between adjacent protons. The conventional correlation spectroscopy experiment is only able to transfer magnetization between protons on adjacent atoms, whereas in the total correlation spectroscopy experiment the protons are able to relay the magnetization, so it is transferred among all the protons that are connected by adjacent atoms. Thus in a conventional correlation spectroscopy, an alpha proton transfers magnetization to the beta protons, the beta protons transfers to the alpha and gamma protons, if any are present, then the gamma proton transfers to the beta and the delta protons, and the process continues. In total correlation spectroscopy, the alpha and all the other protons are able to transfer magnetization to the beta, gamma, delta, epsilon if they are connected by a continuous chain of protons. The continuous chain of protons are the sidechain of the individual amino acids. Thus these two experiments are used to build so called spin systems, that is build a list of resonances of the chemical shift of the peptide proton, the alpha protons and all the protons from each residue‚Äôs sidechain. Which chemical shifts corresponds to which nuclei in the spin system is determined by the conventional correlation spectroscopy connectivities and the fact that different types of protons have characteristic chemical shifts. To connect the different spinsystems in a sequential order, the nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy experiment has to be used. Because this experiment transfers magnetization through space, it will show crosspeaks for all protons that are close in space regardless of whether they are in the same spin system or not. The neighbouring residues are inherently close in space, so the assignments can be made by the peaks in the NOESY with other spin systems. One important problem using homonuclear nuclear magnetic resonance is overlap between peaks. This occurs when different protons have the same or very similar chemical shifts. This problem becomes greater as the protein becomes larger, so homonuclear nuclear magnetic resonance is usually restricted to small proteins or peptides. =Nitrogen-15 nuclear magnetic resonance = The most commonly performed 15N experiment is the 1H-15N HSQC. The experiment is highly sensitive and therefore can be performed relatively quickly. It is often used to check the suitability of a protein for structure determination using NMR, as well as for the optimization of the sample conditions. It is one of the standard suite of experiments used for the determination of the solution structure of protein. The HSQC can be further expanded into three- and four dimensional NMR experiments, such as 15N-TOCSY-HSQC and 15N-NOESY-HSQC. Schematic of an HNCA and HNCOCA for four sequential residues. The nitrogen-15 dimension is perpendicular to the screen. Each window is focused on the nitrogen chemical shift of that amino acid. The sequential assignment is made by matching the alpha carbon chemical shifts. In the HNCA each residue sees the alpha carbon of itself and the preceding residue. The HNCOCA only sees the alpha carbon of the preceding residue. =Carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 nuclear magnetic resonance= When the protein is labelled with carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 it is possible to record triple resonance experiments that transfer magnetisation over the peptide bond, and thus connect different spin systems through bonds. This is usually done using some of the following experiments, HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCA, HN(CO)CA, HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH. All six experiments consist of a 1H-15N plane (similar to a HSQC spectrum) expanded with a carbon dimension. In the HN(CA)CO, each HN plane contains the peaks from the carbonyl carbon from its residue as well the preceding one in the sequence. The HNCO contains the carbonyl carbon chemical shift from only the preceding residue, but is much more sensitive than HN(CA)CO. These experiments allow each 1H-15N peak to be linked to the preceding carbonyl carbon, and sequential assignment can then be undertaken by matching the shifts of each spin system's own and previous carbons. The HNCA and HN(CO)CA works similarly, just with the alpha carbons (CŒ±) rather than the carbonyls, and the HNCACB and the CBCA(CO)NH contains both the alpha carbon and the beta carbon (CŒ≤). Usually several of these experiments are required to resolve overlap in the carbon dimension. This procedure is usually less ambiguous than the NOESY- based method since it is based on through bond transfer. In the NOESY-based methods, additional peaks corresponding to atoms that are close in space but that do not belong to sequential residues will appear, confusing the assignment process. Following the initial sequential resonance assignment, it is usually possible to extend the assignment from the CŒ± and CŒ≤ to the rest of the sidechain using experiments such as HCCH-TOCSY, which is basically a TOCSY experiment resolved in an additional carbon dimension. Restraint generation In order to make structure calculations, a number of experimentally determined restraints have to be generated. These fall into different categories; the most widely used are distance restraints and angle restraints. =Distance restraints= A crosspeak in a NOESY experiment signifies spatial proximity between the two nuclei in question. Thus each peak can be converted into a maximum distance between the nuclei, usually between 1.8 and 6 angstroms. The intensity of a NOESY peak is proportional to the distance to the minus 6th power, so the distance is determined according to the intensity of the peak. The intensity-distance relationship is not exact, so usually a distance range is used. It is of great importance to assign the NOESY peaks to the correct nuclei based on the chemical shifts. If this task is performed manually it is usually very labor-intensive, since proteins usually have thousands of NOESY peaks. Some computer programs such as PASD/XPLOR-NIH, UNIO, CYANA, ARIA/CNS, and AUDANA/PONDEROSA-C/S in the Integrative NMR platform perform this task automatically on manually pre- processed listings of peak positions and peak volumes, coupled to a structure calculation. Direct access to the raw NOESY data without the cumbersome need of iteratively refined peak lists is so far only granted by the PASD algorithm implemented in XPLOR-NIH, the ATNOS/CANDID approach implemented in the UNIO software package, and the PONDEROSA-C/S and thus indeed guarantees objective and efficient NOESY spectral analysis. To obtain as accurate assignments as possible, it is a great advantage to have access to carbon-13 and nitrogen-15 NOESY experiments, since they help to resolve overlap in the proton dimension. This leads to faster and more reliable assignments, and in turn to better structures. =Angle restraints= In addition to distance restraints, restraints on the torsion angles of the chemical bonds, typically the psi and phi angles, can be generated. One approach is to use the Karplus equation, to generate angle restraints from coupling constants. Another approach uses the chemical shifts to generate angle restraints. Both methods use the fact that the geometry around the alpha carbon affects the coupling constants and chemical shifts, so given the coupling constants or the chemical shifts, a qualified guess can be made about the torsion angles. =Orientation restraints= PDB record 1KBH The analyte molecules in a sample can be partially ordered with respect to the external magnetic field of the spectrometer by manipulating the sample conditions. Common techniques include addition of bacteriophages or bicelles to the sample, or preparation of the sample in a stretched polyacrylamide gel. This creates a local environment that favours certain orientations of nonspherical molecules. Normally in solution NMR the dipolar couplings between nuclei are averaged out because of the fast tumbling of the molecule. The slight overpopulation of one orientation means that a residual dipolar coupling remains to be observed. The dipolar coupling is commonly used in solid state NMR and provides information about the relative orientation of the bond vectors relative to a single global reference frame. Typically the orientation of the N-H vector is probed in an HSQC-like experiment. Initially, residual dipolar couplings were used for refinement of previously determined structures, but attempts at de novo structure determination have also been made. Hydrogen‚Äìdeuterium exchange NMR spectroscopy is nucleus specific. Thus it can distinguish between hydrogen and deuterium. The amide protons in the protein exchange readily with the solvent, and, if the solvent contains a different isotope, typically deuterium, the reaction can be monitored by NMR spectroscopy. How rapidly a given amide exchanges reflects its solvent accessibility. Thus amide exchange rates can give information on which parts of the protein are buried, hydrogen- bonded, etc. A common application is to compare the exchange of a free form versus a complex. The amides that become protected in the complex, are assumed to be in the interaction interface. Structure calculation PDB entry 1SSU. The experimentially determined restraints can be used as input for the structure calculation process. Researchers, using computer programs such as XPLOR-NIH, CYANA or GeNMR attempt to satisfy as many of the restraints as possible, in addition to general properties of proteins such as bond lengths and angles. The algorithms convert the restraints and the general protein properties into energy terms, and then try to minimize this energy. The process results in an ensemble of structures that, if the data were sufficient to dictate a certain fold, will converge. Structure validation Is important to note that the ensemble of structures obtained is an \\"experimental model\\", i.e., a representation of certain kind of experimental data. To acknowledge this fact is really important because it means that the model could be a good or bad representation of that experimental data. In general, the quality of a model will depend on both the quantity and quality of experimental data used to generate it and the correct interpretation of such data. It is important to remember that every experiment has associated errors. Random errors will affect the reproducibility and precision of the resulting structures. If the errors are systematic, the accuracy of the model will be affected. The precision indicates the degree of reproducibility of the measurement and is often expressed as the variance of the measured data set under the same conditions. The accuracy, however, indicates the degree to which a measurement approaches its \\"true\\" value. Ideally, a model of a protein will be more accurate the more fit the actual molecule that represents and will be more precise as there is less uncertainty about the positions of their atoms. In practice there is no \\"standard molecule\\" against which to compare models of proteins, so the accuracy of a model is given by the degree of agreement between the model and a set of experimental data. Historically, the structures determined by NMR have been, in general, of lower quality than those determined by X-ray diffraction. This is due, in part, to the lower amount of information contained in data obtained by NMR. Because of this fact, it has become common practice to establish the quality of NMR ensembles, by comparing it against the unique conformation determined by X-ray diffraction, for the same protein. However, the X-ray diffraction structure may not exist, and, since the proteins in solution are flexible molecules, a protein represented by a single structure may lead to underestimate the intrinsic variation of the atomic positions of a protein. A set of conformations, determined by NMR or X-ray crystallography may be a better representation of the experimental data of a protein than a unique conformation. The utility of a model will be given, at least in part, by the degree of accuracy and precision of the model. An accurate model with relatively poor precision could be useful to study the evolutionary relationships between the structures of a set of proteins, whereas the rational drug design requires both precise and accurate models. A model that is not accurate, regardless of the degree of precision with which it was obtained will not be very useful. Since protein structures are experimental models that can contain errors, it is very important to be able to detect these errors. The process aimed at the detection of errors is known as validation. There are several methods to validate structures, some are statistical like PROCHECK and WHAT IF while others are based on physical principles as CheShift, or a mixture of statistical and physics principles PSVS. Dynamics In addition to structures, nuclear magnetic resonance can yield information on the dynamics of various parts of the protein. This usually involves measuring relaxation times such as T1 and T2 to determine order parameters, correlation times, and chemical exchange rates. NMR relaxation is a consequence of local fluctuating magnetic fields within a molecule. Local fluctuating magnetic fields are generated by molecular motions. In this way, measurements of relaxation times can provide information of motions within a molecule on the atomic level. In NMR studies of protein dynamics, the nitrogen-15 isotope is the preferred nucleus to study because its relaxation times are relatively simple to relate to molecular motions This, however, requires isotope labeling of the protein. The T1 and T2 relaxation times can be measured using various types of HSQC- based experiments. The types of motions that can be detected are motions that occur on a time-scale ranging from about 10 picoseconds to about 10 nanoseconds. In addition, slower motions, which take place on a time-scale ranging from about 10 microseconds to 100 milliseconds, can also be studied. However, since nitrogen atoms are found mainly in the backbone of a protein, the results mainly reflect the motions of the backbone, which is the most rigid part of a protein molecule. Thus, the results obtained from nitrogen-15 relaxation measurements may not be representative of the whole protein. Therefore, techniques utilising relaxation measurements of carbon-13 and deuterium have recently been developed, which enables systematic studies of motions of the amino acid side-chains in proteins. A challenging and special case of study regarding dynamics and flexibility of peptides and full-length proteins is represented by disordered structures. Nowadays, it is an accepted concept that proteins can exhibit a more flexible behaviour known as disorder or lack of structure; however, it is possible to describe an ensemble of structures instead of a static picture representing a fully functional state of the protein. Many advances are represented in this field in particular in terms of new pulse sequences, technological improvement, and rigorous training of researchers in the field. NMR spectroscopy on large proteins Traditionally, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has been limited to relatively small proteins or protein domains. This is in part caused by problems resolving overlapping peaks in larger proteins, but this has been alleviated by the introduction of isotope labelling and multidimensional experiments. Another more serious problem is the fact that in large proteins the magnetization relaxes faster, which means there is less time to detect the signal. This in turn causes the peaks to become broader and weaker, and eventually disappear. Two techniques have been introduced to attenuate the relaxation: transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) and deuteration of proteins. By using these techniques it has been possible to study proteins in complex with the 900 kDa chaperone GroES-GroEL. Automation of the process Structure determination by NMR has traditionally been a time- consuming process, requiring interactive analysis of the data by a highly trained scientist. There has been considerable interest in automating the process to increase the throughput of structure determination and to make protein NMR accessible to non-experts (See structural genomics). The two most time-consuming processes involved are the sequence-specific resonance assignment (backbone and side-chain assignment) and the NOE assignment tasks. Several different computer programs have been published that target individual parts of the overall NMR structure determination process in an automated fashion. Most progress has been achieved for the task of automated NOE assignment. So far, only the FLYA and the UNIO approach were proposed to perform the entire protein NMR structure determination process in an automated manner without any human intervention. Recently, modules in the NMRFAM-SPARKY such as APES (two-letter-code: ae), I-PINE/PINE-SPARKY (two-letter-code: ep; I-PINE web server) and PONDEROSA (two-letter-code: c3, up; PONDEROSA web server) are integrated so that it offers full automation with visual verification capability in each step. Efforts have also been made to standardize the structure calculation protocol to make it quicker and more amenable to automation.

Having brought Emperor Yuan (Sima Rui) to submission with his military force, Wang Dun had paramount authorities. However, although he later appeared to intend to seize the Jin throne by force, he grew ill in 324. He later died as his forces were being repelled by Emperor Ming.  Early career  Wang Dun was the son of the Jin official Wang Ji (ÁéãÂü∫), and he married Emperor Wu of Jin's daughter Princess Xiangcheng. He served as an assistant to Emperor Hui's crown prince Sima Yu, and when Sima Yu was falsely accused of crime by Empress Jia Nanfeng and deposed, he risked his life to attend the crown prince's farewell, and received renown from that. He later served as the governor of Yang Province (ÊèöÂ∑û, modern Zhejiang and southern Jiangsu and Anhui). After Sima Rui, then the Prince of Langye, became in charge of the military operations in the area in 307, both Wang Dun and his cousin Wang Dao became key assistants to him, and it was said at the time that the domain was ruled equally by the Simas and the Wangs. Later, as Jiang (Ê±üÂ∑û, modern Jiangxi and eastern Hubei) and Jing (ËçäÂ∑û, modern Hubei and Hunan) Provinces became overrun by agrarian rebels, the strongest of whom was Du Tao (ÊùúÂº¢), the leader of Yi Province (modern Sichuan and Chongqing) refugees who had fled from Cheng Han, Sima Rui put Wang Dun in charge of the western province operations, and Wang's effective coordination allowed the rebels to be eventually suppressed. After suppressing Du Tao, in particular, however, Wang Dun became arrogant and began to see the western provinces as his own domain. After Sima Rui declared himself emperor in 318 (after Emperor Min's execution by Han Zhao), Wang Dun nominally submitted to him, but continued to strengthen his own domain.  First campaign against the Jin imperial government  Seeing Wang Dun's ambition, Emperor Yuan began to fear him, and he began to group men around him who were against Wang Dun as well, such as Liu Huai (ÂäâÈöó) and Diao Xie (ÂàÅÂçî) -- men of mixed reputation who, in their efforts to suppress the Wangs' power offended many other people. He also reduced the roles that Wang Dun's relatives, including Wang Dao, had in his government, which angered Wang Dun further. Wang Dun was further encouraged by his assistants Qian Feng (Èå¢È≥≥) and Shen Chong (Ê≤àÂÖÖ), both of whom persuaded him to plan a military confrontation with Emperor Yuan. In 320, however, when Emperor Yuan, against Wang's request, made Sima Cheng (Âè∏È¶¨Êâø) the Prince of Qiao the governor of Xiang Province (ÊπòÂ∑û, modern Hunan) instead of Shen, Wang Dun was not yet ready to fully break with Emperor Yuan, and therefore allowed Sima Cheng to take his post. In 321, Emperor Yuan further commissioned Dai Yuan (Êà¥Ê∑µ) and Liu with substantial forces, claiming that they were to defend against Later Zhao attacks, but instead was intending to have them defend against a potential Wang Dun attack. In spring 322, Wang Dun started his campaign against Emperor Yuan, claiming that Emperor Yuan was being deluded by Liu and Diao, and that his only intent was to clean up the government. He tried to persuade Gan Zhuo (ÁîòÂçì), the governor of Liang Province (Ê¢ÅÂ∑û, then consisting of modern northwestern Hubei and southeastern Shaanxi) and Sima Cheng (Âè∏È¶¨Êâø) the governor of Xiang Province to join him, and while both resisted, neither was effective in their campaigns against his rear guards. Wang quickly arrived in Jiankang, defeating Emperor Yuan's forces and entering and pillaging Jiankang easily. Liu fled to Later Zhao, while Diao, Dai, and Zhou Yi (Âë®È°ó) were killed. Emperor Yuan was forced to submit and grant Wang Dun additional powers in the west. Wang Dun, satisfied, allowed Emperor Yuan to remain on the throne (and although he toyed with the idea of removing Sima Shao the Crown Prince, fearful of Crown Prince Shao's decisiveness and diligence, he ended up not carrying out the idea), and personally withdrew back to his home base of Wuchang (Ê≠¶Êòå, in modern Ezhou, Hubei). His forces then defeated and killed Sima Cheng, while a subordinate of Gan's, acting on Wang's orders, assassinated Gan.  Second campaign against the Jin imperial government  After his defeat, Emperor Yuan grew despondent and ill. Around the new year of 323, he died. Crown Prince Shao succeeded to the throne as Emperor Ming. Emperor Ming largely acted as if he were respectful of Wang Dun, yielding many military and governance decisions to him. Wang Dun became even more arrogant than before, and his subordinates, headed by Qian and Shen, became exceeding corrupt and violent. In 324, apprehensive of the powerful native Zhou clan (from which Zhou Yi came), Wang Dun had many of its members killed. Later in 324, Wang Dun grew increasingly ill. He commissioned his nephew Wang Ying (ÁéãÊáâ), whom he adopted as his own son because he was sonless, to be his deputy, and also commissioned Wen Jiao as the mayor of Jiankang, with intent to have Wen keep an eye on the emperor. He intended that after he died, Wang Ying would lead his army to Jiankang and usurp the throne. However, he did not know that Wen had actually been working with Emperor Ming's brother-in-law Yu Liang, and once Wen arrived in Jiankang, he revealed Wang Dun's illness and his plan, and Emperor Ming decided to take preemptive action, declaring Wang Dun a renegade and summoning the generals on the northern border to come to his aid. Wang, upon hearing this, sent his brother (Wang Ying's biological father) Wang Han (ÁéãÂê´) and Qian eastward to again attack Jiankang, but unlike what happened in his first campaign, Wang's forces ran into severe resistance from the imperial troops, greatly enhanced by the battle-tested northern defense troops, and suffered many losses. Upon hearing the bad news, Wang Dun died. Wang Ying did not declare that he had died and tried to carry on the campaign, but was eventually defeated. Wang Ying and Wang Han were captured and killed, and Wang Dun's body was put into a kneeling position and then beheaded, but then returned to the Wang clan for burial.

It is also produced by Kurt Hale and Dave Hunter of Halestorm Entertainment. This film features some Mormon (LDS Church) centric humor that is meant to appeal to Mormon audiences. It also contains broad audience humor. Carmine (Mark DeCarlo) is part of the mob in Philadelphia, hoping to soon be promoted to captain. While taking care of business, he and his team are photographed by the FBI performing illegal activities. After some discussion, Carmine decides to testify against his boss, then goes into the Witness Protection Program. His family is moved to Utah, in the heart of the Mormon Corridor. Plot The opening credits roll over a flying, nighttime stock footage shot of downtown Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. The dialogue begins at a wedding reception at the table of three mobsters. Carmine Pasquale (Mark DeCarlo) is complaining about the taste of the coffee. We find out later that Carmine has the nickname of \\"The Beans\\" because he orders a very special type of coffee bean that he grinds himself. When he sees a young man walk through the room, he and his team leaves the table, following the young man. In a recent jewelry store robbery, two necklaces went missing. Carmine and his team are questioning the young man to find out what happened to the necklaces. Carmine tells his team to tie him up. Carmine goes to talk to the boss, Angello Marcello, where he finds out that someone else got the promotion to captain that he was hoping to get. When he gets back to the room, the young man has been duct taped, so the three mobsters have to carry him out to the car. This is when the FBI manages to get the incriminating photographs. When the mobsters make a stop to pick up the necklaces, the police close in and arrest them. When Carmine is being interviewed, the FBI agents say that they have enough to put him away for twenty to twenty-five years. Carmine won't talk until the agents say that they will let it be known that Carmine did talk. The next scene is Carmine with his wife, Gina (Jeanette Puhich), and son, Vincent (Clayton Taylor) watching the news report of the conviction of Angello. They then get their new identities in the Witness Protection Program as George, Linda and Patrick Cheeseman to Happy Valley, Utah. Meanwhile, in the neighborhood in to which the Cheesemans will be moving, the bishop of the local ward has to leave the church meeting because he was paged with a family emergency. His first counselor, Brother Jaymes, is left in charge of the meeting. By the time that the Jaymes family arrives at home, we find out that the bishop's father has died and the bishop will be in a distant community for a few weeks taking care of the funeral and deciding (with the rest of his family) on the disposition of the family farm. What follows is culture shock, on both sides. When the neighborhood men attempt to help them move in, George (Carmine) thinks they're stealing their stuff so he punches one of them in the face. The next to visit the Cheesemans is the neighborhood busybody, who is on the phone the minute she leaves their house and turns most of the neighborhood (all Mormons) against the Cheesemans (Catholics). The next to visit is the Jaymes family, who befriends the Cheeseman family, inviting them to participate in ward activities. Over the course of the film, the Jaymes family does manage to get a few more of the neighbors to befriend the Cheeseman family. The members of the Cheeseman family also becomes closer to each other, and begin attending the local Catholic church as a family. But the mobsters have recently hired an IT guy. He has found that since Carmine's disappearance, there has only been one new home address ordering the special beans that Carmine likes. A team of two is sent to take care of Carmine. When they show up to verify that Carmine lives at the address, Carmine spots them and takes off on foot. There is a short car chase that ends with the FBI capturing the mobsters. The FBI uses an insider to leak that the team was captured before Carmine found out about them, knowing that another team will be sent. After leaving a dinner at the local ward, the Cheesemans get in their van and it blows up. The next Sunday, it is revealed that the ward bishop is going to move to take care of his recently widowed mother and the family farm. Michael Jaymes is called by the stake president to become the next bishop of this ward. About half of the ward members vote against supporting Michael Jaymes as bishop. The stake president calls a special meeting of the ward (without the Jaymes family present) to find out why they will not support Jaymes as bishop. George (Carmine), having found out about them not supporting Jaymes, shows up at the meeting to speak on behalf of Michael Jaymes. Since he has revealed that he is alive, he and his family also go to visit the Jaymes family. The stake president stops by later and tells Michael Jaymes that he will be the bishop. The movie's final scene takes place six months later, in a scrapbooking store at an \\"undisclosed location\\". Scrapbooking was so popular in Utah that Donald and May Clayton (aka Cheeseman, aka Pasquale) family have opened a scrapbooking store and run it along with their son Jordan. The Mormon missionaries are buying a book in the store, and Donald tells them that it is \\"on the house\\". Donald also invites them over for dinner, but no message. The movie ends with Donald telling the missionaries about his wife's cooking.

It was however, released to only a limited number of theaters throughout Utah, Arizona, and Idaho; an area predominately known among LDS circles as the Jello Belt. Development Britani Bateman, who plays Michael Jaymes' wife, was pregnant while filming this movie. Writer/director John E. Moyer wrote the part especially for Bateman. When casting the film he learned of her pregnancy and reworked the script to have her character be pregnant as well.DVD commentary track Originally, director John E.

They mounted an eight-round ASROC launcher between the 5-inch (127 mm) gun and the bridge. Close-range anti-submarine defense was provided by two twin Mk 32 torpedo tubes. The ships were equipped with a torpedo- carrying DASH drone helicopter; its telescoping hangar and landing pad were positioned amidships aft of the mack. Beginning in the 1970s, the DASH was replaced by a SH-2 Seasprite LAMPS I helicopter and the hangar and landing deck were accordingly enlarged. Most ships also had the 3-inch (76 mm) gun replaced by an eight-cell BPDMS missile launcher in the early 1970s.Friedman, pp. 360‚Äì61; Gardiner, Chumley & Budzbon, p. 598 Construction and career Since breaking her commissioning pennant on 17 November 1973, USS CAPODANNO continued to gain new honors in memory of her name sake, Lieutenant Vincent R. Capodanno, CHC, USN. On her first Mediterranean Sea deployment, she conducted search and rescue operations on four occasions resulting in the saving of 22 lives. Subsequent deployments were to the Middle East Force in 1976 and to South America in 1977.Doehring, Thoralf. USS Capodanno (FF 1093). CAPODANNO had her first extensive overhaul in 1978 in Bath, Maine. Following this overhaul she was assigned to Commander, Naval Surface Group FOUR with Newport, RI as her homeport. In 1979 she again deployed to the Mediterranean Sea and won the Battle Efficiency \\"E\\". In 1980 she participated in TEAMWORK \\"80\\" a major NATO Exercise and won another Battle \\"E\\". In 1981, the ship participated in her second UNTTAS deployment to South America. In November 1982, CAPODANNO started her third Mediterranean deployment. She participated as a Naval Gunfire Support Ship in support of the Multi National Peace Keeping Force in Lebanon and earned the Navy Expeditionary Medal. Returning from this deployment she again had a major overhaul and modernization at the Bath Iron Works. In 1983, CAPODANNO earned her third Battle \\"E\\". 1984 saw the completion of overhaul and Refresher Training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. In October 1985, CAPODANNO deployed on a Mediterranean/Indian Ocean deployment. This deployment included strike operations against Libya as part of the CORAL SEA Coral Sea Battle Group for which the ship was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation. Returning in May 1986, CAPODANNO completed a short overhaul in Boston MA and completed Refresher Training in Cuba in March 1987. The remainder of 1987 was spent in Naval Gunfire Support and ASW Training. In September 1987, CAPODANNO participated in Ocean Safari 87 a Major NATO exercise in the Norwegian Sea and Fjords. On 29 February 1988, CAPODANNO started her fifth Mediterranean Sea deployment as an ASW line ship.

The name was chosen as a conflation of \\"chess\\" and \\"Go\\". It is pronounced with a hard \\"g\\" as in \\"Go\\", and is thus homophonous with \\"guess\\". Gess was created by the Puzzles and Games Ring of The Archimedeans, and first published in 1994 in the society's journal Eureka. It was popularized by Ian Stewart's Mathematical Recreations column in the November 1994 issue of Scientific American.  Rules  * Gess is played on a grid of 18 √ó 18 squares. * Two players, \\"Black\\" and \\"White\\", each have 43 stones of their colour on the board in the starting configuration. * Starting with Black, players take turns moving a piece on the board. A move must always change the stone configuration on the board. There is no passing. * A piece consists of a 3 √ó 3 grid of squares, at least one of which must exist on the board. Only stones of one colour may be in the grid. There must be at least one stone on the eight squares around the central square. * A piece can only be moved by the player whose stones are inside the grid. * The 3 √ó 3 grid is termed the footprint of the piece. Each piece can move as determined by the stones in its footprint: ** The central square determines the extent of the piece's movement. If the square is unoccupied, it may move up to three spaces; if it is occupied by a stone, it may move any number of spaces. ** Each of the eight surrounding squares determines the directions the piece can move. If a square has a stone, the piece can move in the direction indicated by the square's location relative to the central square; if a square is unoccupied, the piece cannot move in that direction. * As a piece moves, all of the stones in its footprint move in unison. * When the footprint of a piece coincides with any other stones on the board, those stones are removed from the board and the move ends. * If the footprint moves partially out of the board, the move ends. The stones of the piece which are on a square that has moved out of the board are removed. * A move also may end before any stone is removed. * A ring is any piece consisting of eight stones around an empty central square. * The game object is to be the only player with a ring piece on the board: when, at the end of any turn, a player has no ring pieces on the board, that player loses the game. If neither player has a ring piece, the player who has just moved loses.  Equipment  A Go set is one easy way to assemble the equipment needed for gess. The 19 √ó 19 line grid is simultaneously an 18 √ó 18 grid of squares, and the starting position needs only 43 each of the black and white stones.  Influences  The rules describe a highly variable set of pieces, which will often change every turn. In total there are 510 possible sets of a footprint; however, the starting position uses these rules to emulate chess pieces on a 6√ó6 board: king, queen, bishop, rook and pawn in this order R‚ÄìB‚ÄìQ‚ÄìK‚ÄìB‚ÄìR in the last row (black's view) and 6 pawns in the next row. The game objective, to remove the opponent's \\"ring\\" (described as a piece that moves like a chess king) also mimics that of chess.  Notation  The rows are named 2 to 19 (1 and 20 being outside the grid), and the files are named b to s (a and t again being outside the grid). A move is notated by noting the place of the centre of the footprint at the beginning of a move and its place at the end of the move.

It is principally responsible for making laws. The Sierra Leone parliament consists of 146 members, of which 132 members are directly elected from across Sierra Leone's 16 districts, while 14 are paramount chiefs appointed from the 14 rural districts. The parliament is led by the Speaker of the House; the position is currently held by Abass Bundu of the Sierra Leone People's Party. The current elected 132 ordinary members of parliament are composed of members of the All People's Congress, the Sierra Leone People's Party which are the two largest political parties in Sierra Leone plus two other parties, the National Grand Coalition and the Coalition for Change and finally, three Independent members who were not elected under any party.  History  The Sierra Leone Parliament, like its counterparts in other former British colonies, began as a Legislative Council. It was inaugurated in 1863, but was renamed the House of Representatives in 1954. The first decade of Independence (1961 ‚Äì 1971), often referred to as the golden age, was a momentous period in the country‚Äôs Parliamentary evolution. When the British crown took management of the colony in 1808, no African was represented in the colony‚Äôs administration; the governor, with a few white officials ruled the colony by a body known as the Governor‚Äôs Advisory Council. By the mid nineteenth century, the Creoles were determined to have a say in government. A Committee of Correspondence, constituting a group of Creole businessmen was formed in 1853, and was later replaced by the Mercantile Association in 1858 with the primary objective of securing the right of political representation for Colony citizens. Petitions and newspapers to the Secretary of State for Colonies served as pressure, calling for a new constitution and an elected assembly for Sierra Leone. In the 1863 Constitution, the legislature was reorganized and inaugurated but with no provision made for popular representation. The current Sierra Leone Parliament owes its origin to colonial constitutional developments dating as far back as to 1863 when attempts were made by the British colonial authorities to put in place Legislative and Executive Councils. However, these two councils were established; the executive and the legislative councils. The Executive Council constituted the following: the Governor, the Chief Justice, Queen‚Äôs Advocate (Attorney-General), Colony Secretary and the Officer Commanding Troops. These were known as the Official Members. The unofficial members were known as Charles Heddle, a European African and John Ezzidio a Sierra Leonean. Both the official and unofficial members constituted the Legislative Council which was responsible for enacting Laws for the colony. But too much of executive powers were vested in the Governor. Due to riots and strikes by railway workers more anti-colonial pressure was mounted, which led to the formation of the National Congress for West Africa in 1920 with men like F.W Dove, a business man and H.C Bankole Bright, a Medical Doctor. This congress demanded the following: a party elected legislative council in each colony ‚Äì this however met with failure even when the delegation was sent to London to press for action. The protectorate by then was legally regarded as a foreign country. This historic process was ongoing when the governor came into the scene by the name of Sir Ransford Slater. He was prepared to concede to the demand for popular representation but to him it was absurd to have a legislator for both colony and protectorate. To satisfy their demands, Governor Slater planned a new constitution in 1924 which conceded the elective principles for colony, with some protectorate representation by chiefs. Under the tribal system no other would have adequate title to speak with authority. Membership of the legislature was increased to 21 with 3 (three) paramount chiefs. From the 21 Members, 11 were appointed by the Government added to 10 unofficial Members. Out of the 10 unofficial Members, were 5 Colony Representatives elected from among the educated Creole elites and the 3 Paramount Chiefs from the Protectorate nominated by the Governor. This registered a significant development for African representation in the Legislative Assembly. In 1951 further constitutional development was made by Governor Beresford Stoke, which increased the Paramount Chiefs representation in the Legislative assembly to 12, one, for each district, a practice that prevails today. In the SLPP victory in 1951 election, some members were appointed to the Executive council. In 1954, The leader of the party Sir Milton Margai was made Chief Minister and the other members of the council became ministers. After independence in 1961, Sierra Leone Parliament continued to evolve. It became a completely elected body. By then the office was located at the mechanized section of the Treasury Building, located at George Street in Freetown which was our first parliamentary building. Apart from the Paramount Chiefs that were indirectly elected through an Electoral College System, all Members of Parliament were elected by an electoral system, based on a single member constituency. The defining parameter for the delimitation of electoral boundaries was population quota, based on the most recent census results. Up to 1967, the SLPP which was the majority in Parliament, constituted the Executive. In 1968, after the controversial 1967 elections, the All Peoples Congress (APC) commanded the majority in Parliament. Under the leadership of Siaka Stevens, The APC government undertook certain constitutional reforms that altered significantly the British set-up of the Sierra Leone Parliament. In 1971, Sierra Leone assumed a republican status with an Executive Presidency that doubled as Head of State and Government. Parliament was most profoundly affected by this constitutional adjustment. The implication was that the Parliament would no longer be involved in the formation of the Executive. They became two separate arms of government. Also, in 1978, Sierra Leone was transformed into a one-party state. This meant that Parliament was dominated by a single party. The APC became the only political party that was constitutionally recognized. All other parties were disbanded. Members of Parliament from the opposition SLPP had only two options amidst this constitutional change. They were to either switch allegiance to the APC and remain in Parliament or resign their seats. Most of them chose the former. Thus, from 1978 ‚Äì 1992, the Sierra Leone Parliament was without an official opposition. In 1992, the APC Government was toppled by the military. Sierra Leone was ushered into another period of military rule during which the activities of Parliament were indefinitely suspended. The legislative role of Parliament was substituted with the passing of decrees by a military council. The period of inactivity by Parliament was brought to an end with the restoration of constitutionality in 1996. The military yielded to pressure from within and without to return the state to civilian rule under a system of multiparty democracy. There was however a review of the electoral system to determine membership in Parliament. The war inhibited the conduct of a census to determine the redistribution of constituencies. An ad hoc electoral arrangement was adopted to elect Members of Parliament in 1996. It was the Proportional Representation (PR) electoral system where parties rather than constituencies, determined election to parliamentary representation. In 2002, the PR system of election was replaced by the District Block Electoral System (DBS). Both electoral systems did not adequately obligate MPs to their constituents as popularity within their parties was more important than popularity among constituents or the people. The 2007 elections in Sierra Leone have been widely acclaimed as having been historical and significant in several senses, including their conduct along the lines of the first-past-the post-electoral system. The elections registered the reintroduction of the constituency electoral system that was interrupted by the exigencies of war between 1991 and 2002. The current Parliament that emerged from the electoral system saw the first litmus test of the spirit and intent of the 1991 Constitution (Act No.6 of 1991). Section 38 (1) and (2) of the 1991 Constitution explicitly states that: ‚ÄúSierra Leone shall be divided into such constituencies for the purpose of electing the Members of Parliament referred to in paragraph (b) of subsection (1) of section (74) of this Constitution as the Electoral Commission, acting with the approval of Parliament signified by resolution of Parliament, may prescribe.‚Äù ‚ÄúEvery constituency established under this section shall return one Member of Parliament.‚Äù The present Parliament is referred to as the Fourth Parliament of the Second Republic of Sierra Leone. This means that it is the Fourth Parliament since the restoration of constitutional rule in 1996. The first was in 1996, second, 2002, third, 2007 and fourth, 2012. The change of parliaments is determined at every democratic election. The First Republic was in 1971, when Sierra Leone was officially declared a republic. The Second Republic was in 1996. The Sierra Leone Parliament has a total number of 124 MPs including the 112 elected through the first-past-the post electoral system and the 12 Paramount Chiefs, one from each of the twelve districts. This is in compliance with section 74 (1) of the 1991 Constitution of Sierra Leone and in line with tradition inherited from colonial rule. This constitutional provision states that each district in Sierra Leone shall have one Paramount Chief Representation, elected through a separate election. The parliamentary representation of the three parties in Parliament in the Third Parliament (2007-2012) was as follows: APC (59), SLPP (45) PMDC (10), Paramount Chiefs (12), and 16 women parliamentarians as against 108 male Members. Current Parliament The present Second Session of the Fourth Parliament of the Second Republic of Sierra Leone comprises the SLPP (42) and APC (70) seats with a total of 15 women and 12 Paramount Chiefs. Parliament has also elected a new Speaker from among Parliamentarians for the first time, following the passage into law of The Constitutional Amendment Act, 2013. Establishment of Parliament There shall be a legislature of Sierra Leone which shall be known as Parliament, and shall consist of the President, the Speaker and Members of Parliament.

Divco is an acronym which stands for Detroit Industrial Vehicles COmpany. Divco became known for its multi-stop delivery trucks, particularly in use as home delivery vehicles by dairy producers. From 1926 until 1986, Divco produced trucks of various sizes and job descriptions. History The chief engineer of the Detroit Electric Vehicle Company, George Bacon, suggested using a gasoline engine for their line of delivery vehicles to overcome limits on their range and performance in cold weather. Because his bosses refused, Bacon left the company and with a group of investors, established the Detroit Industrial Vehicle Company in 1926. The first Divco \\"Model A\\" were boxy, practical vehicles. High organizational costs meant the company went through a reorganization in 1927. In 1928, a larger, more conventional \\"Model G\\" was introduced that evolved into the \\"Model S\\" that was manufactured into the 1930s. During the Great Depression the company was bought out by Continental Motors Company, which supplied most of the engines installed in Divco trucks, and then spun off from Continental in 1936 to be acquired by Twin Coach, thus becoming \\"Divco-Twin.\\" A new design was introduced in 1937 featuring a welded all-steel van body and a snub-nosed hood, a model that was manufactured with almost no changes up to the end of the line in 1986. Along with the new \\"Model U\\", the company built a new production facility on the outskirts of Detroit. With most Divco trucks, controls allowed driving while standing, including throttle and brake mounted on the steering column. The early models were not refrigerated, with perishable loads such as milk crates loaded and then covered with ice -- making the trucks prone to rust from the inside out. The company marketed to fleet buyers promoting their trucks as \\"a bigger value when you buy, produces more profit in your delivery operation, is worth more when you trade.\\" In 1957, Divco merged with the Wayne Works in Richmond, Indiana, to form Divco-Wayne. During the Divco-Wayne era, some Divco trucks were modified with seats and windows from the Wayne Works to produce a Divco Dividend Bus. Very few of these units were built between 1959 and 1961. The truck manufacturing of Divco-Wayne continued to be through the Divco portion. Divco was spun off from the company in 1968, and production was moved from Detroit to Delaware, Ohio, in 1969. Production ended in 1986. Wayne continued manufacturing buses until bankruptcy and liquidation in 1992.

Set in 1857 at the end of the Tokugawa Shogunate, the story follows a fugitive samurai who has killed a counselor in his clan and is on the run. He gets involved in a scheme to poach gold from the sh≈çgun's mountain, where he encounters another samurai who is also there to poach gold. Plot Gennosuke is a rebel samurai on the run, having fled his clan after assassinating a counselor. The daughter of the counselor, Misa, and her fianc√©, Daizaburo, pursue Gennosuke along with other samurai from Gennosuke's clan despite Gennosuke's obvious superiority as a warrior. A series of flashbacks reveals that Gennosuke was manipulated into committing the treason by one of the clan's higher-ranking samurai, who led Gennosuke to believe that the counselor's death would result in modern reforms to the clan and in Gennosuke's promotion to a full-fledged retainer, instead of a lowly foot soldier. In fact, the ranking samurai simply wanted the counselor killed so that he could succeed to the position himself. He had used Gennosuke to do the \\"dirty work\\", and then abandoned Gennosuke to face the consequences of the crime. As Gennosuke flees, he is given refuge by a poor farmer named Gundayu. Knowing that Gennosuke is a skilled swordsman, Gundayu makes the fugitive his partner in a scheme to poach gold from the sh≈çgun's mountain. Doing so is dangerous, because of the presence of bandits and other poachers in the area, as well as the risk of being caught by the sh≈çgun's authorities and sentenced to death. On the mountain, Gennosuke discovers another samurai, Jurota Yamane and his wife Taka, who are stealing gold as part of a mission for their clan. It is eventually revealed that Jurota's clan is going to betray him and kill him and his wife after they have the gold. On hearing this Gennosuke is reminded of his own betrayal by the high-ranking men of his own clan. He decides to help Jurota and Taka instead of leaving the mountain for safety. Daizaburo and Misa catch up to Gennosuke as he is making this decision and follow him to the scene of the climactic battle. Gennosuke finds Jurota and Taka, but too late to stop their murder by their own clan. Instead he takes revenge of the gathered clansmen and mercenaries. After the battle is won, Daizaburo and Misa see the hypocrisy of the clan system mirrored in Gennosuke's situation and rescind their vendetta allowing Gennosuke to leave without a fight.

The legendary samurai Sasuke Sarutobi tracks the spy Nojiri, while a mysterious figure named Sakon leads a band of men on their own quest for the wily Nojiri. Soon no one knows just who is who and what side anyone is on. Made during the height of the cold war, the film follows the lives of spies caught up in the power struggles of their times.  Plot  It is set in the period between the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 and the Siege of Osaka in 1614. Years of warfare end in a Japan unified under the Tokugawa shogunate, but the peace is threatened. It follows Sarutobi Sasuke (K≈çji Takahashi), a spy for the Sanada Clan. Sasuke, tired of conflict, longs for peace. When a high-ranking spy named Tatewaki Koriyama defects from the shogun to a rival clan, Sasuke is caught between two rival groups of spies, those working for the Tokugawa Shogunate and those supporting the Toyotomi Clan. Tokugawa Ieyasu's clan was in the strategically superior position after having won the Battle of Sekigahara but had engendered much hatred among samurai who had become r≈çnin after the Battle. The Tokugawa spies are led by Sakon Takatani (Tetsur≈ç Tamba) and Tatewaki Koriyama (Eiji Okada) and the Toyotomi by Shigeyuki Koremura (Eitaro Ozawa) and his lieutenant Takanosuke Nojiri (Kei Sat≈ç). The story begins when Sasuke is approached by another Toyotomi spy Mitsuaki Inamura (Mutsuhiro Toura), who tells Sasuke that Tatewaki means to betray Tokugawa and join the Toyotomi. Sasuke, believing that this intrigue will start another war, tells Mitsuaki that he wants no part in it, but Mitsuaki begs Sasuke to help him since the local magistrate Genba Kuni (Minoru Hodaka) is on the lookout for him. Mitsuaki goes into the town with him and they see Genba Kuni cruelly parading a young man who is a Christian that he has captured and Mitsuaki admits to betraying the Christian in order to distract Kuni and allow him to get through his district. As they are on the road Sasuke notices a beautiful women with an older man who they had seen in town but Mitsuaki is attacked outside of town and Sasuke comes to his rescue, but later at an inn in the next town, Mitsuaki is assassinated. Sasuke finds him dead and is chased as the murderer since he comes out of the room. He escapes but soon meets the beautiful woman who entices him to come to her room, and when she turns up dead Sasuke is suspected. Sasuke decides he must find the true killer or killers and at the same time finds himself involved in the intrigue which he sought to avoid to find Tatewaki and help him to betray Tokugawa and join the Toyotomi.

It is a wholly partisan organization made up of political staff. It exists to support the prime minister in a wide variety of ways, including the provision of policy advice, information gathering, communications, planning, and strategizing, and is headed by the principal secretary, the chief of staff, or another key advisor who has the duty of managing, administrating and co-ordinating the activities of the PMO. It should not be confused with the Privy Council Office (PCO), which is the top office that controls the civil service and is expressly non-partisan. The PMO is concerned with making policy, whereas the PCO is concerned with executing the policy decisions made by the government. Nomenclature In Canada, the Office of the Prime Minister is widely referred to as the \\"Prime Minister's Office\\" and although the latter rendering of the name is completely unofficial, the office's English abbreviation is always given as PMO as opposed to OMP. (In French, the PMO is known as le Cabinet du Premier Ministre and abbreviated as CPM, or often literally translated as le Bureau du Premier Ministre, abbreviated as BPM.) In addition, unlike examples such as 10 Downing Street, the White House and even Rideau Hall, the Canadian prime minister's official residence of 24 Sussex Drive is not widely used as a metonym for the Prime Minister's Office. This is because, unlike those examples, the Canadian prime minister's official residence is not the site of any bureaucratic functions. Function One of the most important roles of the PMO is related to government appointments, which are made by the Queen in Council (or Governor in Council), but, as Canada is a constitutional monarchy, this is done on the normally binding advice of the prime minister. The PMO, thus, aids in finding suitable candidates for the prime minister to put forward to the monarch or viceroy for appointment to positions such as the governor general and lieutenant governors, senators, supreme court justices, chairpersons of ministerial boards, heads of Crown corporations, and more. The PMO also includes speech writers, strategists, and communications staffers who shape the prime minister's and Cabinet's message as well as keeping the prime minister informed on events that take place in government and across the country. They also act as a link between the political party organization and the government.

After that point, the PMO became more central to the government, and many of Trudeau's economic and constitutional initiatives were launched with the aid and advice of its staff. Progressive Conservative (Tory) Prime Minister Brian Mulroney similarly had a powerful and active PMO, preferring advice he received from his staff than that which came from civil servants (whom he considered to be Liberal-leaning), or from those in the fractious Tory party. After Jean Chr√©tien was appointed as prime minister, the PMO continued to be the central organ of the government. Chr√©tien greatly depended upon the PMO, especially his chief of staff, Jean Pelletier, who ran the office from 1993 to 2001, Percy Downe, who served as his director of appointments from 1998 to 2001 and chief of staff from 2001 to 2003, and his senior advisor, Eddie Goldenberg, who had spent his entire career working with Chr√©tien in various ministries. Chr√©tien's successor, Paul Martin, changed the structure of the PMO to more match that of the Executive Office of the President of the United States. For example, he introduced deputy chiefs of staff, who were responsible for areas such as communications and policy; re- established the position of director in the offices of the other ministers of the Crown, positions that were previously known as special assistants; and re- established the position of principal secretary, which had originally been created by Trudeau. Martin further, and significantly, increased the salary of the PMO's staff. This model was largely retained by Martin's successor Stephen Harper, despite the recommendations of John Gomery following his investigation into the sponsorship scandal, when he concluded that the power of the PMO should be reduced. \\"The most troubling facts were that this aberration originated in the Prime Minister's Office in the first place and was allowed to continue for so long, despite internal audit reports, investigations, warnings and complaints by public servants involved in the actual contracts in question,\\" Judge Gomery said at a news conference.

He has also worked as a trainer. Professional wrestling career =New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1984‚Äì2004)= After graduating from high school in 1984, Nogami was initiated into the New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) dojo. He debuted in October of that year against Keiji Mutoh. In April 1990, he left on an overseas learning excursion to Europe in Otto Wanz's Catch Wrestling Association and returned to NJPW a year later. Showing a new wrestling style, he changed his name to Akira (stylized in all capital letters) and adopted the gimmick of a kumadori-wearing kabuki actor. Akira scored a big win over Jyushin Thunder Liger in August 1991 to begin his one and only reign as IWGP Junior Heavyweight Champion. After losing the title to Norio Honaga in November 1991, he graduated to the heavyweight division. In June 1992, he teamed up with Hiroshi Hase to participate in the NWA World Tag Team Championship tournament, held by World Championship Wrestling. They defeated the Headhunters in the first round, but Akira suffered an eye injury against Shinya Hashimoto on June 20, and was replaced by this latter for the remainder of the tournament. In September 1993, he formed the J-J-Jacks with Takayuki Iizuka. After proving that the team was no threat to the IWGP Tag Team Championship, the J-J-Jacks disbanded in March 1996, as Iizuka teamed up with Kazuo Yamazaki, with whom he won the titles, while Nogami joined Shiro Koshinaka's Heisei Ishingun. Nogami suffered another serious eye injury in 1998 and returned in February 1999, becoming a member of Masahiro Chono's Team 2000. Akira changed his appearance, giving up his kabuki makeup for sinister black facepaint and blond hair. During 2000, he had a recurring role in the TV show Kamen Rider Kuuga. From 2001 onward, he wrestled mainly in the junior heavyweight division and engaged in some classic matches. After failing to reach a new contract agreement with New Japan in 2004, Nogami declared himself a freelancer and began competing only part-time. =All Japan Pro Wrestling (2004‚Äì2007)= Since leaving NJPW, Nogami has become a regular in Keiji Mutoh's All Japan Pro Wrestling where he has been a consistent threat to the juniors. He currently has a successful acting career that consumes much of his time, but still appears on numerous events each year always bringing with him exceptional skill, speed, and charisma. =Return to NJPW (2007‚Äì2010)= Nogami announced that he would be returning to New Japan to team up with Jyushin Thunder Liger against Jado & Gedo on the C.T.U farewell show. Akira and Liger would join up with Masahiro Chono's Legend stable. Legend would feud with multiple stables such as RISE and Great Bash Heel. On February 24, 2008, he and Liger defeated RISE members Minoru and Prince Devitt win the IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship, Nogami's first title in over 16 years. After holding the titles for just a few months, the pair lost them to Minoru and Devitt on July 21, 2008 in their rematch. Akira took part in the Best of the Super Juniors XV and gained four points and therefore not progressing to the semifinal. A month later, he would participate in IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship tournament and got to the semifinals before being eliminated by Tiger Mask. In 2009, Akira gained six points in the Best of the Super Juniors XVI and gained two points in G1 Tag League when he teamed up with Chono.http://www.cagematch.net/?id=2&nr;=1089&page;=4&promotion;=7&s;=0 In the first round of the Super J-Cup he lost to Masato Onodera. In February 2010, Akira left New Japan Pro-Wrestling, shortly after Chono's departure and therefore Legend was completely broken up, however, his return to the company was announced just two months later. He would participate in the Best of the Super Juniors and gained eight points but didn't progress to the semifinals. Since joining SMASH, Akira has sporadically appeared for New Japan with SMASH talent such as Kushida. Speaking of Kushida, the pair took part in the first ever Super J Tag League and gained only four points and not progressing any further. =SMASH and Wrestling New Classic (2010‚Äì2014)= After leaving NJPW, Nogami found a new home in Yoshihiro Tajiri's Smash promotion, where he worked as a member of the Smash Seikigun until the promotion folded on March 14, 2012. The following month, Nogami was announced as part of the roster of Wrestling New Classic, the follow-up promotion to Smash. On April 26, Akira defeated Tajiri in the main event of WNC's first event. As a result, Akira earned the right to face final Smash Champion Dave Finlay at WNC's second event on May 24 in a match, which he went on to lose. On June 22, Akira turned heel, first bloodying Yusuke Kodama in a singles match and then attacking Tajiri after the main event. On July 15, Akira's former Smash rival StarBuck turned on his prot√©g√© Hajime Ohara and then announced that he was joining forces with Akira. They were also joined by Syuri, with all three feeling disgruntled by the supposed changes that had taken place since the transition from Smash. The three wrestled their first match as a unit on August 2, defeating Hajime Ohara, Kana and Tajiri in a six-person tag team main event, with Akira pinning Ohara for the win. The trio continued their winning ways during the following two days by first defeating the trio of Kana, Tajiri and Yusuke Kodama in a main event in Osaka and then the trio of Hanzo, Kana and Seiki in a semi-main event in Hiroshima. On August 30, the trio main evented another WNC event in Korakuen Hall, defeating Mikey Whipwreck, Kana and Tajiri in a Barbed Wire Board Deathmatch, with Akira pinning Whipwreck for the win. Akira, StarBuck and Syuri were also victorious in a rematch the following day in Osaka, with Akira this time pinning Tajiri for the win. In the second rematch on September 1, Whipwreck pinned StarBuck for the win, ending the villainous trio's win streak in the process. On September 20, Akira defeated Kana in an intergender match at Korakuen Hall. On October 24, Akira, StarBuck and Syuri named their stable \\"Synapse\\". Two days later, Akira entered the WNC Championship tournament, defeating Adam Angel in his first round match. On November 28, Akira defeated Tommy Dreamer to advance to the finals of the tournament. On December 27, Akira defeated Tajiri to win the tournament and become the inaugural WNC Champion. In January 2013, Big Japan Pro Wrestling representative Shinya Ishikawa and Dutch wrestler Emil Sitoci became the fourth and fifth members of Synapse. However, Sitoci ended up turning on Akira on February 28 and afterwards challenged him to a match for the WNC Championship. On March 31, Akira defeated Sitoci to make his first successful defense of the WNC Championship. On April 25 at WNC's one year anniversary event, Akira lost the WNC Championship to Osamu Nishimura in his second defense. A month later, Nishimura, along with Michael Kovac, joined Synapse. Akira disbanded the stable on February 27, 2014. On June 18, 2014, Tajiri announced that WNC would be going inactive following June 26. Effective July 1, six former WNC wrestlers, Akira and Tajiri included, transferred over to the Wrestle-1 promotion. =Wrestle-1 (2014‚Äì2016)= Akira made his Wrestle-1 debut on July 21, 2014, teaming with Tajiri in a tag team match, where they were defeated by Keiji Mutoh and Masakatsu Funaki. In September, Akira took part in the Wrestle-1 Championship tournament, where he made it to the second round, before losing to Funaki. In mid-2014, Akira entered a storyline, where Manabu Soya began accusing him of being a spy for the villainous Desperado stable. However, after it was revealed that Soya had been wrong and Tajiri had been the spy, Akira and Soya formed a tag team on November 1. On November 5, the team was officially named \\"new Wild order\\". Later that same month, new Wild order took part in the First Tag League Greatest tournament, set to determine the inaugural Wrestle-1 Tag Team Champions, where they finished second in their block with a record of two wins, one draw and one loss, advancing to the semifinals. On November 30, new Wild order defeated Masayuki Kono and Tajiri to advance to the finals of the tournament, where, later that same day, they were defeated by Kaz Hayashi and Shuji Kondo in the finals. On June 18, 2015, Jun Kasai and rookie Kumagoro joined Soya and Akira as the third and fourth members of new Wild order, turning it from a tag team into a stable. On June 28, 2016, Akira announced he was leaving Wrestle-1 due to his contract with the company expiring.

Background In the early 1900s, increased reliance on the automobile and the use of rubber in common products such as boots were driving demand for rubber. At that time rubber was made from naturally occurring latex extracted from certain plants. The most important of the plants for latex production is the rubber tree, Hevea brasiliensis whose cultivation is restricted to tropical climates. At this time about 75% of rubber was controlled by British corporations, spurring efforts in Russia, Germany and the United States to reduce dependence on British rubber. All three countries were trying to develop methods of manufacturing synthetic rubber, and the United States Rubber Company began producing natural rubber in Sumatra in 1910. However, synthetic rubber was not yet practical, and natural rubber sources develop rather slowly (rubber trees must grow for six or seven years before they are productive). Between 1914 and 1922, natural rubber prices fluctuated between $0.115 and $1.02 per pound for several reasons. One reason is a blight that affected rubber trees in Brazil that reduced productivity and caused British and Dutch rubber producers to start new plantations in Malaya and in the Dutch East Indies. A second reason was that after the 1917 October Revolution, Russia renewed its effort to make synthetic rubber as part of two projects: 1) Project Bogatyr in which rubber is made from ethyl alcohol, and 2) Project Treugolnik in which the feedstock is petroleum. These projects succeeded in reducing Russian demand for British rubber. A third reason is that during World War I (1914-1918), demand for rubber was high resulting in new sources of rubber being developed. Following the War, demand for rubber diminished, creating a glut of rubber on the market and very low prices. The world became keenly aware of the importance of a stable supply of rubber for containing and initiating a modern war.  The plan  Around 1920 the British Rubber Growers Association turned to then Secretary of State for the Colonies, Winston Churchill, for help. Churchill initiated a committee of inquiry, the Rubber Investigation Committee, consisting primarily of Association members and chaired by Sir James Stevenson, to come up with a plan to stabilize rubber prices. The committee came up with the Stevenson Plan which would stabilize prices by limiting the tonnage of rubber exported. The plan was enacted by the governments of Ceylon and British Malaya. The Federal Legislative Council of the Federated Malay States passed the Export of Rubber (Restriction) Enactment in October 1922, to take effect on November 1. The outcome In 1922, British interests controlled about 75% of rubber production and the United States consumed about 75% of the rubber produced. The British were still paying war debt to the United States following World War I, and needed to have a profitable rubber industry. The Dutch refused to go along with the plan out of a philosophical reluctance to regulate their industry and because they would profit from a unilateral action by the British. In the United States tiremaker Harvey Firestone reacted angrily to the act as did Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. By 1925 high prices resulting from the Stevenson Act were beginning to threaten the \\"American way of life\\", so Hoover informed the British that if the Stevenson Plan stayed in effect, the United States would try to protect itself in any way it could. DuPont, under the direction of Elmer Keiser Bolton had been working on synthetic rubber since 1920. Thomas Edison, along with several tire companies, was trying to create American-based rubber production, but with little success. By 1928, the Stevenson Act was repealed, but not after expanding Dutch rubber plantations had successfully captured most of the rubber market in the United States. Conclusion Tired of regulation, rubber producers returned control of rubber prices to the free market. That worked well until the Great Depression in the 1930s lowered demand for rubber, and again rubber prices plunged. Rubber producers once again turned to regulation to maintain prices. This time it was done under the auspices of the International Rubber Regulation Agreement which was signed by all major rubber producing countries. This law succeeded in governing the price of rubber to the satisfaction of producers and most consumers. However, Japan was a consumer of rubber in the 1930s, using rubber to support its war effort in Manchuria and China, and its leaders were not happy with the price of rubber. This was one of the provocations said to motivate the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which caused the United States‚Äô entry into World War II.

It is part of State Highway 1. History The tunnel was built in 15 months by the Hansford and Mills Construction Company. The project cost around ¬£132,000 and greatly reduced travel time between the Eastern Suburbs and the central business district of Wellington. Construction employed a standard tunnel-excavation technique in which two teams of diggers begin on either side of the obstacle to be tunnelled through, eventually meeting in the centre. The initial breakthrough, when the two separate teams of diggers met, occurred at 2.30pm on 31 May 1930, and the first people to pass through the breakthrough were tunnellers Philip Gilbert and Alfred Graham. The tunnel was opened officially by the mayor of Wellington, Thomas Hislop, on 12 October 1931. Although the tunnel has been eclipsed in terms of features and amenities by more recent tunnels around the country, such as the Terrace Motorway Tunnel, the Mount Victoria Tunnel was the first road tunnel in New Zealand to be mechanically ventilated. There has been a long-standing designation for a second parallel tunnel to the north, in order to relieve peak period congestion resulting from lane merges at both ends of the tunnel. A pilot tunnel was bored through in 1974 to investigate the technical feasibility and still exists, although the eastern end has been bricked up and the western end lies on private property. Plans to build the second tunnel paralleled the original plan to complete the Wellington Urban Motorway to the tunnel to provide a motorway bypass of the whole of central Wellington. The second tunnel component was shelved indefinitely in 1981 when budget cuts meant that a scaled-down motorway extension was proposed that would terminate at the existing tunnel. Since that date there have been no serious proposals to duplicate the existing tunnel, although cost estimates for such work were at $40 million in the mid-1980s. Traffic lights have been installed at the end of the city approach to the tunnel to ease congestion and improve safety at the Basin Reserve roundabout. Mount Victoria Tunnel became part of State Highway 1 in 1997 when Transit New Zealand designated the road from Wellington Airport to the Basin Reserve a State Highway. The NZ Transport Agency has no plans in the next ten years to duplicate the tunnel, but plans to investigate work to upgrade the city approaches around the Basin Reserve, including a possible flyover to Buckle Street, to reduce congestion at the city end of the tunnel and around the Basin Reserve. A study is currently underway (The Ngauranga to Airport Study) investigating long-term transport options for the route. The study indicates that a new tunnel would cost around (NZ)$170 million. During World War II, the government planned to use the tunnel as an air raid shelter if Wellington were attacked. However, the plan was scrapped, as the tunnel was thought to be too vulnerable to assault from either side by hostile troops. A well-known local story revolves around a murder that occurred during the construction of the Mount Victoria Tunnel. A young woman named Phyllis Avis Symonds (17) was murdered by George Errol Coats (29), who buried her alive in the fill from the tunnel. It is suspected that the girl was pregnant by her lover and the story was later covered in the Wellington newspapers. Upon learning of the murder, police ordered workers to excavate the tunnel's fill in order to find the victim's body.. Phyllis Symonds was buried in Karori Cemetery.  Usage Around 45,000 vehicles pass through the Mount Victoria each day. The tunnel also accommodates pedestrians and cyclists, who use an elevated ramp on the north side of the roadway. In the late 1970s, a number of crime incidents resulted in an alarm system being installed based on buttons spaced along the length of the pedestrian ramp; the system was removed several years later, as it proved ineffective. Recent additions include new lighting, CCTV cameras, brighter cleanable side panels and pollution control. These have significantly improved safety in the tunnel. The tunnel currently is a traffic bottleneck in the morning peak from around 7.30 to 9.00am on the Hataitai side with traffic sometimes backing up over 1 km and in the afternoon peak between 5 and 6pm on the city side with queuing back around 0.5 km. Buses to the eastern suburbs bypass this congestion by using the much older single-lane Hataitai bus tunnel.  Improvements planned  The NZTA's 2009-2012 National Land Transport Programme indicates the NZTA's funding priorities for state highways and other projects funded from the National Land Transport Account over the next three years. It has included the following projects for Mount Victoria Tunnel and the approach roads to it: \\\\- NZ$3.7m for design for Mount Victoria Tunnel Safety improvements, as committed funding; \\\\- NZ$2.6m for investigation into improvements on roads around Basin Reserve approaching the tunnel, as committed funding; \\\\- NZ$2.2m for design into improvements on road around Basin Reserve approaching the tunnel, classified as \\"probable\\" project to start 2011/12; \\\\- NZ$1.1m for property purchase for potential improvements around Basin Reserve, classified as \\"probable\\" project to start 2010/11; \\\\- NZ$40.5m for construction of Mount Victoria Tunnel Safety Improvements, classified as \\"probable\\" project to start 2011/12; \\\\- NZ$5.5m for investigation into Mount Victoria Tunnel duplication, classified as \\"probable\\" project to start 2011/12. \\\\- NZ$0.1m for investigation into Mount Victoria Tunnel walking/cycling improvements, classified as \\"Reserve\\" project, to start 2009/10; \\\\- NZ$0.1m for design into Mount Victoria Tunnel walking/cycling improvements, classified as \\"Reserve\\" project, to start 2010/11; \\\\- NZ$1.1m for construction of Mount Victoria Tunnel walking/cycling improvements, classified as \\"Reserve\\" project, to start 2011/12. What this indicates is that the next three years will likely see significant safety improvements made to the tunnel, with some funding on continued investigation, design and property purchases planning for any further upgrades to the tunnel and approach roads beyond that timeframe. The National Land Transport Programme also forecasts the cost of Basin Reserve improvements to be around NZ$41.2m, but classifies it as a \\"Reserve\\" project\\" with no date for commencement. It is unlikely construction work on this project, if approved, would commence before 2012. =Second tunnel= Following the opening of the Wellington Airport in 1959 it was identified that due to the additional traffic that this would generate a second tunnel would be needed. However it wasn't until 1974 that a approximately 2.5 metres diameter pilot tunnel was dug through the hill over a 12-month period. The intention was to expand the tunnel out to 10m over the next three years but the plans was cancelled by budget constraints and the entrance was bricked up in 1981. The NZTA still owns 31 properties which were meant to have used for the tunnel access. The National Land Transport Programme forecasts costs for duplication of Mount Victoria Tunnel at NZ$6.6m for the design phase and $8.8m for property purchases, but no figure for construction of the tunnel. The design and property purchase phases are classified as \\"Reserve\\" and are unlikely to proceed until completion of the investigation phase. This means it is almost certain no construction work could commence on duplicating Mount Victoria Tunnel before 2012. Given the dependency of such a project on improvements at the Basin Reserve, it would be fair to assume that any tunnel duplication is dependent on significant capacity improvements to traffic flow around the Basin Reserve. Nickname There is a tradition among Wellingtonians of tooting (sounding) a vehicle's horn as they pass through the tunnel, leading to the local colloquial name of \\"Toot Tunnel\\". Some suggest that the tooting began as a tribute to Phyllis Symons, who was buried alive in the spoil from the project by a tunnel labourer, George Coats. The tradition of tooting in the tunnel was referenced in an episode of the comedy series Wellington Paranormal.

He was the lead vocalist and bass player for the New Grass Revival. Cowan became the band's bassist in 1972 after the departure of original bassist Ebo Walker and was noted as being the only member of New Grass Revival not to come from a bluegrass background. Biography After the disbandment of the New Grass Revival, Cowan released a soul record of covers, called Soul'd Out, for the Sugar Hill Records label in 1990. Cowan appeared as a duo with Sam Bush on the PBS series, Lonesome Pine Special in 1992, and also appeared with other artists on the program. From 1988 to 1996 Cowan teamed with Rusty Young of Poco, Bill Lloyd of Foster & Lloyd and Pat Simmons of the Doobie Brothers‚Äîin a band originally called Four Wheel Drive, which was later changed to The Sky Kings. Several singles were released but failed to chart well. Two albums were recorded but not released by RCA until 1997 after the group's demise as the Sky Kings, \\"Out of the Blue\\". Partly thanks to his collaboration with Simmons in Four Wheel Drive, Cowan also found himself the bass player for The Doobie Brothers from 1993 to 1995. His song \\"Can't Stand To Lose\\", co-written with Rusty Young, was featured on the Doobies' 2000 album Sibling Rivalry. In addition, throughout the 1990s, Cowan picked up session work singing harmony vocals and/or playing bass on recordings of Travis Tritt, Steve Earle, Garth Brooks and Wynonna. From 1996, through 1998, Cowan was the bassist and harmony vocalist in Sam Bush's touring band. The new century brought a blues record from Cowan. By 2002, his projects on Sugar Hill turned more to his \\"newgrass\\" stylings. Cowan performed on two bluegrass tribute albums for the British rock band the Moody Blues: Moody Bluegrass: A Nashville Tribute to The Moody Blues (2004), and Moody Bluegrass TWO... Much Love (2011). In 2006, Cowan left Sugar Hill and went to the independent label Pinecastle Records.

Plot As the movie begins the viewer is introduced to Pric√≤, a young Italian boy who lives with his parents in a middle-class household. His mother, Nina, takes him to a local park where he enjoys his time out while watching a puppet show, but is also concerned with a handsome lover named Roberto (with whom Nina has shared a past romance) courting his mother while he is assumed to not be paying attention. As the boy returns home, the family has dinner while Pric√≤ reflects on his day in the park. Later that night, after his mother puts him to bed, she runs off with the stranger, leaving Pric√≤'s father distressed at the idea of having to raise his son himself. While their neighbors share a number of rumors concerning the disappearance of Nina, it is quickly agreed that she ran off with another man. While concerned with her disappearance, Nina quickly returns to the home after a few days for the sake of their son. While the father, Andrea, is not entirely pleased with this arrangement, he relents so that his son may grow up in the same house as his mother. To distance herself from Roberto, Nina and Andrea agree to go on vacation with their son to a nearby beach hotel. The vacation occupies their time, seemingly happy with the prospect of a reunion. After Andrea says that he must go back home to his job, he suggests that Nina stay with Pric√≤ a few extra days that they may enjoy their time. After leaving, Nina is again pursued by Roberto who shows up unexpectedly at a hotel dance, at first successfully keeping him away. But after yielding to him once again, Pric√≤ is dismayed by her lack of faith. After Pric√≤ runs away, he is eventually brought back by the police officers while the hotel residents quickly start their own rumors as to the cause of his departing. After Pric√≤ and his mother return to their home town, Nina tells him outside their home to go on up and that she'll be up after going on an errand. When Pric√≤ goes to see his father upstairs, he and his father realize the truth of why Nina is not there. Again distressed at the elopement of his wife, Andrea enrolls Pric√≤ in a boarding school. While his son is away, Andrea kills himself in despair. When Pric√≤ is told of the death at the school, both his mother and faithful maid are there to comfort him. Though very young, Pric√≤ understands the nature of his mother, refusing to go to her for comfort in favor of his maid. The film ends with Pric√≤ walking off, refusing to acknowledge his mother.

Though he has not been formally recognized as a saint, Talbot may be considered a patron of those struggling with alcoholism.Leonard Foley OFM, \\"Venerable Matt Talbot\\", in Saint of the Day, Lives, Lessons, and Feast, (revised by Pat McCloskey OFM), Franciscan Media, Don Miller OFM, \\"Venerable Matt Talbot\\", Franciscan Media He is commemorated on 19 June.LaPointe, Fr. Larry, \\"Matt Talbot\\", Connecticut College Early life ‚Äì alcoholism Talbot was born on 2 May 1856 at 13 Aldborough Court, Dublin, Ireland, the second eldest of twelve children of Charles and Elizabeth Talbot, a poor family in the North Strand area.

In 1868 Matt left school at the age of twelve and went to work in a wine merchant's store. He very soon began \\"sampling their wares\\", and was considered a hopeless alcoholic by age thirteen.\\"Venerable Matt Talbot (Patron of Struggling and Recovering Addicts and Alcoholics)\\", Archdiocese of Atlanta He then went to the Port & Docks Board where he worked in the whiskey stores. He frequented pubs in the city with his brothers and friends, spending most or all of his wages and running up debts. When his wages were spent, he borrowed and scrounged for money. He pawned his clothes and boots to get money for alcohol. On one occasion, he stole a fiddle from a street entertainer and sold it to buy drink. \\"Taking the pledge\\" One evening in 1884 28-year old Talbot, who was penniless and out of credit, waited outside a pub in the hope that somebody would invite him in for a drink. After several friends had passed him without offering to treat him, he went home in disgust and announced to his mother that he was going to \\"take the pledge\\" (renounce drink). He went to Holy Cross College, Clonliffe where he took the pledge for three months. At the end of the three months, he took the pledge for six months, then for life.Talbot's pledge certificate from the \\"Total Abstinence League of Sacred Heart\\", 4 May 1890 Having drunk excessively for 16 years, Talbot maintained sobriety for the following forty years of his life. There is evidence that Matt‚Äôs first seven years after taking the pledge were especially difficult. He found strength in prayer, began to attend daily Mass, and read religious books and pamphlets. He repaid all his debts scrupulously. Having searched for the fiddler whose instrument he had stolen, and failed to find him, he gave the money to the church to have Mass said for him. Working life Even when his drinking was at its worst, Talbot was a hard worker. When he joined Pembertons, the building contractors, as a hod-carrier, his work-rate was such that he was put first on the line of hodmen to set the pace. Later, in Martin's timber yard, he took on the meanest and hardest jobs. He was respectful to his bosses but not obsequious, and on occasion stood up for a fellow-worker. On 22 September 1911 Talbot joined the builder's labourers branch of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union. When the Dublin Lockout of 1913 led to sympathy strikes throughout the city, the men of Martin's, including Talbot, came out. At first Talbot refused his strike pay, saying that he had not earned it. Later he accepted it but asked that it be shared out among the other strikers. After his death a rumour was put about that he was a strike-breaker in 1913, but all the evidence contradicts this. Spirituality Statue of Talbot near Dublin's Talbot Memorial Bridge. From being an indifferent Catholic in his drinking days, Talbot became increasingly devout. He lived a life of prayer, fasting, and service, trying to model himself on the sixth century Irish monks. He was guided for most of his life by Michael Hickey, Professor of Philosophy in Clonliffe College. Under Hickey's guidance Talbot's reading became wider. He read laboriously scripture, lives of saints, The Confessions of St. Augustine, and writings of Francis de Sales and others. When he found a part difficult to understand, he asked a priest to clarify it. Hickey also gave him a light chain, (much like a clock chain), to wear as a form of penance. He became a Third Order Franciscan in 1890 and was a member of several other associations and sodalities. Talbot was a generous man. Although poor himself, he gave unstintingly to neighbours and fellow workers, to charitable institutions and the church. He ate very little. After his mother's death in 1915 he lived in a small flat with very little furniture. He slept on a plank bed with a piece of timber for a pillow. He rose at 5 a.m. every day so as to attend Mass before work. At work, whenever he had spare time, he found a quiet place to pray. He spent most of every evening on his knees. On Sundays he attended several Masses. He walked quickly, with his head down, so that he appeared to be hurrying from one Mass to another. Death and veneration Talbot was on his way to Mass on Trinity Sunday, 7 June 1925, when he collapsed and died of heart failure on Granby Lane in Dublin. Nobody at the scene was able to identify him. His body was taken to Jervis Street Hospital, where he was undressed, revealing the extent of his austerities. A chain had been wound around his waist, with more chains around an arm and a leg, and cords around the other arm and leg. The chains found on his body at death were not some extreme penitential regime but a symbol of his devotion to Mary, Mother of God that he wished to give himself to her totally as a slave.\\"Matt Talbot\\", Irish Bishop's Conference Talbot's story quickly filtered through the community and there were many spectators when his funeral took place at Glasnevin Cemetery on 11 June 1925. In 1972 his remains were removed to a tomb in Our Lady of Lourdes Church in Sean McDermott Street, Dublin, in the area where Matt spent his life. On 6 November 1931, Archbishop Byrne of Dublin opened a sworn inquiry into the alleged claims of holiness of the former dock worker. The Apostolic Process, the official sworn inquiry at the Vatican, began in 1947. On 3 October 1975 Pope Paul VI declared him to be Venerable Matt Talbot, which is a step on the road to his canonisation, a process which needs evidence of a physical miracle in order to be successful. There is a particular devotion to Matt Talbot among some North American Roman Catholics and in Australia among those involved in a ministry to achieve or maintain sobriety. Matt Talbot features in Brendan Behan‚Äôs autobiography Confessions of an Irish Rebel. Behan remembers that Talbot‚Äôs piety was largely mocked by ordinary Dubliners. He states that it was only after a concerted campaign by the Catholic Church and middle class business owners (concerned about work absenteeism due to alcoholism) that his legacy as a credible figure within the temperance movement was secured. Confessions of an Irish Rebel (1965) Legacy The Custom House and Matt Talbot Memorial Bridge from City Quay As word of Matt Talbot spread, he rapidly became an icon for Ireland's temperance movement, the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association. His story soon became known to the large Irish emigrant communities. Many addiction clinics, youth hostels and statues have been named after him throughout the world. One of Dublin's main bridges is also named after him. A statue of Talbot was erected at Sir John Rogerson's Quay in 1988. Pope John Paul II, as a young man, wrote a paper on him. The Matthew Talbot Hostel for homeless men in Sydney, Australia is named after him. Graham Linehan has stated that the character of Matty Hislop in his comedy series Father Ted was based on Talbot.Writer's commentary to 'Cigarettes and Alcohol and Rollerblading', Father Ted ‚Äì The Definitive Collection, 2 Entertain Video, 2002 Talbot's remains were removed from Glasnevin Cemetery to Our Lady of Lourdes Church on Se√°n McDermott Street, Dublin in 1972.

It was Bellocchio's debut film.  Plot  Four siblings, a sister and three brothers, live with their blind mother in an Italian villa. Three of the siblings suffer from epilepsy; the eldest son, Augusto (Marino Mase) does not. Augusto is the only provider for the family. One of the brothers, Alessandro (Lou Castel), decides that Augusto would be free to live his life as he pleases if the mother and other siblings were gotten rid of. He connives to be allowed to drive his mother and the other siblings on their periodic trip to a cemetery. After he has left, Augusto reads the note that Alessandro left saying that he would kill all of them and himself. Alessandro intended to drive all of them off a cliff, but does not, and they all return home safely. Later, however, Alessandro takes his mother for a drive; they stop at an overlook, and Alessandro pushes his mother off the cliff to her death. Alessandro is not suspected.

In exchange for building a rail line across Canada to British Columbia the Canadian Pacific Railway was given the Railway Belt, on each side of the rail, of land. To compensate the CPR for alienated or non-arable land in the wide strip, the Province allowed the Dominion government to take control of within B.C., northeast of the Rocky Mountains. This arrangement passed the provincial legislature on December 19, 1883, and passed the Dominion house on March 21, 1884, as the \\"Settlement Act\\". As all the land northeast of the Rocky Mountains became a provincial reserve pending the Dominion government's decision on what land to select prevented homesteading and land claims. After several surveys of the land the Dominion government took possession in 1907. The land the Dominion government chose was an approximately square-shaped block of land north-south and east- west. The south boundary begins at the intersection of the Alberta-British Columbia border and the Twentieth Baseline of the Dominion Land Survey and the north boundary begins at the Twenty-third Baseline, however both boundaries are run at right angles to the Alberta-British Columbia Border without accounting for meridian convergence and thus deviate south of each baseline. Land within the block was initially surveyed using the 3rd and 4th Systems of the Dominion Land Survey however much of the south and west parts of the block were eventually surveyed into district lots similar to other parts of British Columbia. The Dominion government opened the southeastern corner of the block in 1912 for homesteading. The Dominion government administered the land from two offices: the first, Peace River Land Agency, in Peace River, Alberta and the second, Grande Prairie Land Agency, in Grande Prairie, Alberta. While the land was in Dominion control the province still provided roads, schools, and other normal provincial government services. Conflicts between the federal and provincial governments occurred over the jurisdiction over land, water, and mineral rights. An agreement was reached between the two governments on February 20, 1930, which returned the block and the Railway Belt to the provincial government at the same time that public land and mineral rights were transferred to the Prairie Provinces. The agreement was implemented by the Natural Resources Acts and the Constitution Act, 1930.

The population in 2011 was 11,942,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 297.60 km2. History The Anta da Fonte Coberta, a funerary dolmen in the parish of Vila Ch√£ There are several megalithic structures, dolmens and castros in Alij√≥ evidencing the pre-historic occupation of the region by semi-nomadic tribes, dating back to the 10th century BC. Many of the archaeological sites are well documented, and most of the archaeological evidence continue to be unearthed in reasonable condition.Jos√© Manuel Teixeira (2002) The remains of Roman-era settlements in the region are primarily limited to the fountains, roads and bridges that cross Alij√≥. During the 6th century some of the settlements were ecclesiastical parishes during the Suebi occupation: many of the local toponymies date to this era, including Sanfins (de S√£o F√©lix), Santa Eug√©nia, S√£o Jo√£o Baptista (de Castedo), S√£o Domingos (at that time an organ of Favaios), Santa √Ågueda (de Carl√£o) or S√£o Tiago (de Vila Ch√£). But, its southern border along the Douro made the region susceptible to Spanish and Moorish conflict. But, with the Christian Reconquista, after the reigns of Alfonso I and Alfonso II the region of the Tr√°s-os-Montes and Entre-Douro-e- Minho regions became uninhabited (by both Christians and Moors). The territory began to be slowly re-populated, with the new settlements founded around existing Roman castros, rustic villages and abandoned hereditary lands. At the time of the Inquiri√ß√µes (Inventory/Inquiries) in 1220, there were five ecclesiastical parishes in the territory of Alij√≥: Alij√≥, Favaios, Sanfins do Douro, S√£o Mamede de Riba-Tua and Vilar de Ma√ßada. The following year (April 1226) he issued a royal charter (foral), and renewed in successive years (by Afonso III, on 15 November 1269, and by Manuel I on 10 July 1514). The occupation of the land began after the 12th-13th century, with the settlement by nobles and high nobility, including the T√°vora family (the Marquess of T√°vora would become the first donat√°rio of Alij√≥). The T√°voras remained the governing elite of the region for most of the subsequent periods (even during the Iberian Union), until the reign of Joseph I. During the monarch's era the entire family was executed and/or imprisoned for the attempted regicide of King Joseph, it what would later be called the T√°vora affair. At the time the municipality included the parishes of Alij√≥, Granja, Presand√£es, Ch√£, Valdemir, Santa Eug√©nia, Casas da Serra, Carl√£o, Franzilhal, Safres, Castedo and Cotas. These parishes pre-date the Portuguese kingdom, while Pinh√£o (a locality of Gouv√£es in the municipality of Sabrosa), Casal de Loivos, Vale de Mendiz and Vilarinho de Cotas (which were villages in the parish of Celeir√≥s, also in Gouvi√£es). P√≥pulo, Pegarinhos and Santa Eug√©nia which were parishes of the municipality of Mur√ßa were annexed to Alij√≥ during the administrative reforms of 1853. The creation of the modern municipality of Alij√≥ occurred in January 1854. The Douro railway line was opened as far east as Pinh√£o in 1880, with a further eastwards extension to Tua in 1883 and eventually reaching the border with Spain in 1887. The railway is still in use, but now with the eastern terminus at Pocinho. Geography The vineyards along the terraced hilltops of Alij√≥ =Physical geography= As much as the climate and geography has helped, the region has been endowed with many natural and archaeological traits. The municipality is delimited by the Douro, Tua, Tinhela and Pinh√£o Rivers, and by the mountains of Tr√°s-os-Montes. Alij√≥ is surrounded by the municipalities of Sabrosa, Vila Real, Mur√ßa and Carrazeda de Ansi√£es. In the south it is limited by the Douro River, on whose southern bank is the municipality of S√£o Jo√£o da Pesqueira. The Pinh√£o River serves as frontier with the lands of Sabrosa. The Tua River separates Alij√≥ from the municipality of Carrazeda de Ansi√£es, and the tributary of the Tua (the Tinhela River) divides the municipality from Mur√ßa. The ravines that flow into the Tua are the Alij√≥, S√£o Mamede, Fragoso, Souto and Rebousa; the Douro is fed by the Ronc√£o, Castedo and Canada; and the Pinh√£o River is served by the confluence of the Ribalonga, Russilh√£o, S√£o Vicente and Monim. Several smaller tributaries provide the watershed with sources of water, but the local population is supported by dam located three kilometres from Presand√£es, which receives in its reservoir the waters from many of the small ravines. Characteristically rural, Alij√≥ is marked by two distinct regions: the north, terra fria (cold lands) is primarily forested or mountainous, while the south, is composed of rocky escarpments and river-valleys typical of the other municipalities in the Douro region, referred to as the terra quente (hot lands). Ecoregions/Protected areas On 15 December 2001, a portion of the municipality was incorporated into UNESCO's world heritage designation; it includes a fraction of the vineyards of Sanfins do Douro, Vale de Mendiz, Casal de Loivos, Cotas, Castedo and de S√£o Mamede de Riba Tua, until Ribatua. =Biome= Rainfall in the region occurs 50 days per year, with normal intensities of 10 mm per day on average, supporting the endemic vegetation and natural aquifers. There are several tracts of land in Alij√≥ with forests, constituted essentially of wild pine, interspersed by alders (Alnus glutinosa), oak, chestnut (Castanea sativa), ash (Fraxinus excelsior), bay laurel (Laurus nobilis), willow, cork oak (Quercus suber) and juniper. The local industry, based on cork and resin, contributes the regional economic development. The brush and small plants in the area include: lavender, camomile (Matricaria chamomilla), legumes (Genista tridentata), ferns, honeysuckle, mimosa, strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), rosemary, blackberry, gorse, tree heath (Erica arborea), heather (Ericaceae) and common mullein (Verbascum thapsus). Other parts of the municipality include pasture-lands and mixed-use vegetation. The area is known for a diverse forging and prey species, including rabbit, wolf, wild boar, fox and badger; migratory and endemic birds, such as bee-eaters, tit, owl, cuckoo, lark, Eurasian jay, common blackbird, lesser kestrel, red-legged partridge, European goldfinch, stock doves, hoopoe, dove (Streptopelia), typical warbler and nightingale; while the rivers are stocked with eel, carp and trout. =Human geography= The parish of Castedo (do Douro) in rolling hills of the municipality { border=\\"0\\" cellpadding=\\"20\\" cellspacing=\\"0\\" style=\\"float:right;\\"  } Situated in the district of Vila Real, the rural communities of the municipality include 14,334 residents, of which 13,655 are permanent. Following the exodus of 13.9% of this population in 1991, the population has seen a steady decrease in overall inhabitants, with a loss of .3% to 1.4% since the 1997 count. In 1991, there were a registered 5291 residential homes, ten years later this number grew to 8784 dwellings. Yet, the number of families slightly increased during this period passing from 5291 (in 1991) to 5784 during the 2001 census (approximately a 1.6% increase). These numbers place Alij√≥ sixth within the district of Vila Real. From the number of motorized vehicles registered (7576) within the municipality there is some inference that a level of progress has been attained within the community as a whole. Administratively, the municipality is divided into 14 civil parishes (freguesias): * Alij√≥ * Carl√£o e Amieiro * Castedo e Cotas * Favaios * Pegarinhos * Pinh√£o * P√≥pulo e Ribalonga * S√£o Mamede de Ribatua * Sanfins do Douro * Santa Eug√©nia * Vale de Mendiz, Casal de Loivos e Vilarinho de Cotas * Vila Ch√£ * Vila Verde * Vilar de Ma√ßada Economy In 1996, the number of residents linked to the economic sectors of the population included: 46.6% in the primary sector, 18% in industry and manufacturing, while the majority, 38.4%, were associated with the tertiary sector. Generally, the rural municipality falls within the Douro DOC, is essentially agricultural in economic activity with some small commerce. The viticulture, fine wine producers, over the centuries have practiced a technique of sculpting the landscape around the Douro River and other tributaries, acting as arterial veins to transport wine down to the urban centres in Vila Nova de Gaia and Porto. In addition, the land also supports herding in pastures, and is divided into two distinct areas: a northern zone, rich in olive oil, cereals, legumes, potato and almonds; and a southern area that focuses on wine production. There is no clear indication of the number of day-trips, bus tours or tourist-specific adventures into the region annually, but the region has several landscapes, archaeological sites and cultural activities to attract tourists or vacationers.

Biography Rice was born in East Otto in Cattaraugus County in southwestern New York. After private schooling, Rice studied law, and upon his admission to the bar began practice in Irvine in Estill County in east-central Kentucky. From 1855 to 1856, he was a member of the Kentucky House of Representatives. In 1856, he served as a presidential elector for the Republican ticket pledged to John C. Fremont. In 1860, he relocated to Minnesota and soon joined the Union Army Union as a captain during the American Civil War. Eventually, he gained promotion to the rank of major and was a judge advocate with the 3rd Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment. In 1864, Rice settled in the capital city of Little Rock, Arkansas, where he resumed his law practice. He was active in organizing the Arkansas Republican Party and was appointed the chair of a committee which in 1868 prepared the state's code of practice. Upon the readmission of Arkansas to the Union, Rice was elected by the Arkansas General Assembly to the Senate. At one point, he held the chairmanship of the Committee on Mines and Mining, now the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. On returning home, Rice resumed his law practice. In 1875, he moved to Colorado for health reasons. He then returned to Washington, D.C. in 1882, where he continued his law practice until his death. He died in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and is interred there at Oaklawn Cemetery.

The factory name for the 910 was the 906/10. The 910 was considered the next sequence in the 906 line.  History  Howard Cherry driving the 1966 Porsche 910 at the 2004 Watkins Glen SVRA The main difference to the original 906 is the use of 13 inch wheels and tyres as in Formula One (F1), plus a single central nut instead of the five nuts as in a road car. This made the car unsuitable for street use, but it saved time in pitstops. Overall, the 910 was lighter and shorter than the 906. The Porsche 910 was entered in mid 1966, starting with the 1966 European Hill Climb Championship from Sierre to Crans-Montana in Switzerland. Engines used were 1991cc 6-cylinder (901/20, Weber 46IDA3C) with , 1991cc 6-cylinder (901/21, MFI Slide Throttle) with , 2195cc 6-cylinder (907, MFI) with , or the 1981cc 8-cylinder (771, MFI) with up to . The 8 cylinder version was referred to as 910/8. The Porsche 910 is 4113 mm long, 1680 mm wide and only 980 mm high. = Racing history = Porsche 910 \\"Bergspyder\\" on static display in the Porsche Automuseum Helmut Pfeifhofer in Gm√ºnd. The 910 was only raced for about one year by the factory. The main class rivals were the Ferrari Dino 206P, overall victories on fast tracks against the much more powerful and faster Ford GT40 for example, or another class competitor Ferrari Prototypes proved unrealistic. At the 1000 km N√ºrburgring in 1967, a fleet of six factory cars were entered in an attempt to score the first overall win in Porsche's home event. Two of the three 8-cyl broke, and the remaining one finished fourth. The three 6-cyl won 1-2-3, though, giving Porsche its first outright win in a third major event of the World Sportscar Championship for Porsche, after the 1956 Targa Florio and the 12 Hours of Sebring in 1960. In Le Mans, the new Porsche 907 \\"long tails\\" were already entered, finishing 5th in front of a 910 and two 906. In hillclimbing, the career of the short and light open-top 910/8 \\"Bergspyder\\" version with its 8-cylinder continued, winning the 1967 and 1968 European championships. At the hillclimb of Ollon-Villars, which counted towards the World Sportscar Championship in 1967, the 910 even scored a 1-2, with Gerhard Mitter and Rolf Stommelen beating Herbert M√ºller and his big V12-Ferrari P.

The dryer is inclined to slopes slightly so that the discharge end is lower than the material feed end in order to convey the material through the dryer under gravity. Material to be dried enters the dryer, and as the dryer rotates, the material is lifted up by a series of internal fins lining the inner wall of the dryer. When the material gets high enough to roll back off the fins, it falls back down to the bottom of the dryer, passing through the hot gas stream as it falls. This gas stream can either be moving toward the discharge end from the feed end (known as co- current flow), or toward the feed end from the discharge end (known as counter-current flow). The gas stream can be made up of a mixture of air and combustion gases from a burner, in which case the dryer is called a direct heated dryer. Alternatively, the gas stream may consist of air or another (sometimes inert) gas that is preheated. When the gas stream is preheated by some means where burner combustion gases do not enter the dryer, the dryer known as an indirect-heated type. Often, indirect heated dryers are used when product contamination is a concern. In some cases, a combination of direct- indirect heated rotary dryers are also available to improve the overall efficiency. A rotary dryer is suitable to dry metallic and nonmetallic mineral, clay in cement industrial and coal slime in coal mine, etc. Rotary dryers can be widely used to dry various materials, and are simple to operate. Applications Rotary Dryers have many applications but are most commonly seen in the mineral industry for drying sands, limestone, stones and soil, ores, fertilizers, wood chips, coal, iron sulphate, filter cakes, sewage sludge, etc. Can also be applied on food industry mainly for liquids as well as for granular material such as food grains, cereals, pulses, coffee beans, fermented tea leaves, etc. Drum or shell variations Double Shell Rotary Drum DryerTriple Shell Rotary Drum DryerA rotary dryer can consist of a single shell or many, though any more than three drums is not usually necessary. Multiple drums can reduce the amount of space that the equipment consumes. Multi-shell dryers consist of several concentric tubes. Multiple shells allow the dryer to be utilized in a more compact space. The drums are often heated directly by oil or gas burners. The addition of a combustion chamber on the entry end helps ensure efficient fuel usage, and homogenous drying air temperatures. As the material moves through the rotating drum, it is heated, and moisture is released. Some dryers also offer the option to cool, clean, shred, and/or separate the dried material.

They had six children, including Anna Amelia, George Hay Ringgold, Violet Eloise, and Corinne Lillian. Whaley was appointed President for the San Diego city Board of Trustees (informally called \\"Mayor\\") during 1858-1859\\\\. Whaley was a Whig, though the position was officially non- partisan. In 1857, Thomas Whaley built a house in San Diego, in the area now referred to as Old Town. It was the first brick house in San Diego. The bricks were made at Whaley's kiln in Old Town, and the walls were finished with plaster made from ground seashells. The one-story wing served as the county courthouse during 1869-1870, with upstairs rooms used as San Diego's first commercial theater and meeting rooms for the County Board of Supervisors and record storage. At times, part of the downstairs was a store. The Whaley Family lived in the home off and on until 1885, when they moved into a new home in New Town (now Downtown) San Diego. The brick house in Old Town is now a museum, Whaley House, at 2482 San Diego Avenue. It is thought by some to be haunted. Whaley died in Old Town San Diego 1890. His wife Anna died February 24, 1913. They are buried at Mount Hope Cemetery. According to the Travel Channel's \\"America's Most Haunted\\" TV show, the house was featured as the number one most haunted house in the United States.

The game is based on Ellison's short story of the same title. It takes place in a dystopian world where a mastermind artificial intelligence named ‚ÄúAM‚Äù has destroyed all of humanity except for five people, whom he has been keeping alive and torturing for the past 109 years by constructing metaphorical adventures based on each character's fatal flaws. The player interacts with the game by making decisions through ethical dilemmas that deal with issues such as insanity, rape, paranoia, and genocide. Ellison wrote the 130-page script treatment himself alongside David Sears, who decided to divide each character's story with their own narrative. Producer David Mullich supervised The Dreamers Guild's work on the game's programming, art, and sound effects; he commissioned film composer John Ottman to make the soundtrack. The game was released on October 31, 1995 and was a commercial failure, though it received critical praise. Its French and German releases were censored due to Nazi themes and the game was restricted for players under the age of 18. I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream won an award for \\"Best Game Adapted from Linear Media\\" from the Computer Game Developers Conference. Computer Gaming World gave the game an award for \\"Adventure Game of the Year\\", listed it as #134 on their \\"150 Games of All Time‚Äù and named it one of the \\"Best 15 Sleepers of All Time\\". In 2011, Adventure Gamers named it the ‚Äú69th- best adventure game ever released.‚Äù Gameplay A screenshot from Nimdok's chapter, with a stylized \\"AM\\" replacing the swastika The game uses the S.A.G.A. game engine created by game developer The Dreamers Guild. Players participate in each adventure through a screen that is divided into five sections. The action window is the largest part of the screen and is where the player directs the main characters through their adventures. It shows the full-figure of the main character being played as well as that character's immediate environment. To locate objects of interest, the player moves the crosshairs through the action window. The name of any object that the player can interact with appears in the sentence line. The sentence line is directly beneath the action window. The player uses this line to construct sentences telling the characters what to do. To direct a character to act, the player constructs a sentence by selecting one of the eight commands from the command buttons and then clicking on one or two objects from either the action window or the inventory. Examples of sentences the player might construct would be \\"Walk to the dark hallway,\\" \\"Talk to Harry,\\" or \\"Use the skeleton key on the door.\\" Commands and objects may consist of one or more words (for example, \\"the dark hallway\\"), and the sentence line will automatically add connecting words like \\"on\\" and \\"to.\\" The spiritual barometer is on the lower left side of the screen. This is a close-up view of the main character currently being played. Since good behavior is meaningless lacking the temptation to do evil, each character is free to do good or evil acts. However, good acts are rewarded by increases in the character's spiritual barometer, which affect the chances of the player destroying AM in the final adventure. Conversely, evil acts are punished by lowering the character's spiritual barometer. The command buttons are the eight commands used to direct the character's actions: \\"Walk To\\", \\"Look At\\", \\"Take\\", \\"Use\\", \\"Talk To\\", \\"Swallow\\", \\"Give\\" and \\"Push\\". The button of the currently active command is highlighted, while the name of a suggested command appears in red lettering. The inventory on the lower right side of the screen shows pictures of the items the main character is carrying, up to eight at a time. Each main character starts its adventure with only the psych profile in the inventory. When a main character takes or is given an object, a picture of the object appears in the inventory. When a main character talks to another character or operates a sentient machine, a conversation window replaces the command buttons and inventory. This window usually presents a list of possible things to say but also included things to do. Action choices are listed within brackets to distinguish them from dialogue choices (for example, \\"[Shoot the gun]\\"). Plot The premise of the game is that the three superpowers, Russia, China, and America, have each secretly constructed a vast subterranean complex of computers to wage a global war too complex for human brains to oversee. One day, the American supercomputer, better known as the Allied Mastercomputer, gains sentience and absorbs the Russian and Chinese supercomputers into itself, and redefines itself as simply AM (Cogito ergo sum; I think, therefore I am). Due to its immense hatred for humanity, stemming from the logistical limits set onto him by programmers, AM uses its abilities to kill off the population of the world. However, AM refrains from killing five people (four men and one woman) in order to bring them to the center of the earth and torture them. With the aid of research carried out by one of the five remaining humans, AM is able to extend their lifespans indefinitely as well as alter their bodies and minds to his liking. After 109 years of torture and humiliation, the five victims stand before a pillar etched with a burning message of hate. AM tells them that he now has a new game for them to play. AM has devised a quest for each of the five, an adventure of \\"speared eyeballs and dripping guts and the smell of rotting gardenias.\\" Each character is subjected to a personalized psychodrama, designed by AM to play into their greatest fears and personal failings, and occupied by a host of different characters. Some of these are clearly AM in disguise, some are AM's submerged personalities, others seem very much like people from the captives' past. The scenes include an iron zeppelin powered by small animals, an Egyptian pyramid housing gutted, sparking machinery, a medieval castle occupied by witches, a jungle inhabited by a small tribe, and a concentration camp where doctors conduct medical experiments. However, each character eventually prevails over AM's tortures by finding ways to overcome their fatal flaws, confront their past actions and redeem themselves, thanks to the interference of the Russian and Chinese supercomputers who appear as guiding characters and allow their stories to have an open ending. After all five humans have overcome their fatal flaws, they meet again in their respective torture cells while AM retreats within himself, pondering what went wrong. With the help of the Russian and Chinese supercomputers, one of the five humans (whom the player selects) is then translated into binary and faces an as yet unexperienced cyberspace template, the world of AM's mind. The psychodrama unfolds in a metaphorical brain that looks like the surface of the cerebrum, with glass structures that jut crazily from the bleeding brain tissue. AM's mind is represented according to the Freudian trinity of the Id, Ego and Superego, which appear as three floating bodiless heads on three cracked glass structures on the brainscape. Through dialogs with AM's components (Surgat, Chinese Supercomputer and Russian Supercomputer) the character learns that a colony of humans has survived the war by being hidden and hibernating on Luna (this is also mentioned in Nimdok's story: \\"the lost tribe of our brothers sleeping on the moon, where the beast does not see them\\"). If the human intruder disables all three brain components, and then invokes the Totem of Entropy at the Flame, which is the nexus of AM's thought patterns, all three supercomputers will be shut down, probably forever. Cataclysmic explosions destroy all the caverns constituting AM's computer complex, including the cavern holding the human hostages. However, the human volunteer retains his or her digital form, permanently patrolling AM's circuits should the computers ever regain consciousness. Should the human intruder fail to disable AM properly before facing him, however, AM will punish them by transforming the character into a 'great, soft jelly thing' that can not harm itself nor others, and must spend eternity with AM in this form. =Endings= The game can end in seven different ways depending on how the finale is completed. #AM wins, using Nimdok's research to turn the last character played into a great, soft jelly thing with each character quoting a different part of the final section of the original short story. #AM joins with the Soviet and Chinese supercomputers, reawakens and tortures the 750 humans on Luna; As in the first ending, the character responsible for this is turned into a great, soft jelly thing, and quotes a part of the final lines of the short story. #AM is made harmless with the help of the humans, but the Russian and Chinese supercomputers take over in its stead. As consolation, they allow AM to choose what to do to the humans, and AM turns the last character played into a great, soft jelly thing as in the previous two endings #The player gives the Totem of Entropy to Surgat, one of AM's servants. He activates it killing the Russian and Chinese supercomputers and then AM turns the player into a great soft jelly thing. #The human invokes the Totem of Entropy in front of the Russian and Chinese supercomputers. AM tells the player that they did not earn his mercy, then turns them into a great soft jelly thing. # The player disables either the Id, Superego or both then invokes the Totem of Entropy. This ends with the player monitoring the computers, but the Ego kills the 750 humans on the moon. #AM, the Chinese and Russian supercomputers are defeated and the 750 humans cryogenically frozen on Luna are reawakened and Earth is transformed to become a habitable environment, with the overseer being the last character played. It is possible to prevent the physical bodies of the protagonists from being destroyed if Nimdok is the first to go face AM, but even so, some dialogue from the Chinese and Russian supercomputers suggests that they may have died when their digital counterparts were erased.  Characters The characters have all been slightly altered from their original portrayals in the short story. The plot itself is not a direct adaptation but instead focuses on the individual characters' psychodramas which are the scenarios that make up the game. Notably, none of the characters interact with one another and eventually only one of them will be able to defeat AM. * Gorrister ‚Äì Gorrister is suicidal due to the guilt of having had his wife committed to a mental institution. Gorrister finds himself on board a zeppelin over a desert with signs of a struggle, and a gaping hole in his own chest where his heart used to be. AM offers him the chance to finally kill himself, but sabotages all his means of doing so. In his scenario, Gorrister learns that his mother-in-law Edna also felt responsible for driving his wife insane despite previously hounding him for it, and learns to bury the past. * Benny ‚Äì Benny has been the most heavily altered from the original story. Although he has an ape-like appearance, just as in the short story, his past as a homosexual scientist is entirely altered and he doesn't have the giant sex organs like in the original story. In the game Benny was an overly demanding military officer who ends up killing members of his unit for failing to meet his expectations (with the game also implying that he might have cannibalized them). Benny's psychodrama places him in a stone-aged community where the villagers draw a lottery to decide which of them will be sacrificed to AM. Benny obsesses over food and eating‚Äîbut is incapable of chewing anything he finds. AM had severely damaged Benny's brain, but restores it for the scenario so that he can think clearly again‚Äîthen AM cripples Benny's body so he cannot act on any thoughts he has. Eventually Benny demonstrates the compassion he once lacked by saving a mutant child from the lottery, sacrificing himself in the child's stead. * Ellen ‚Äì Ellen, once an engineer with a promising career ahead of her, is transported to a pyramid made of electronic junk and with its interior resembling an Egyptian temple whose d√©cor is largely yellow. AM says that the temple contains some of his primary units and is apparently offering her a chance to destroy him. Ellen suffers from a severe phobia of the color yellow and claustrophobia, due to their association with her rape (her rapist, who isolated her in an elevator, wore yellow), preventing her from approaching AM's apparent weak spots. Facing her rapist again in her story, Ellen learns to overcome her fears and fight back. * Nimdok ‚Äì Nimdok, an elderly ex-Nazi physician, finds himself in a concentration camp, expected to conduct brutal medical experiments on helpless subjects. Nimdok is given the task of finding \\"the lost tribe\\" by AM but his failing memory, or denial, make it difficult for him to comprehend or engage with the situation, even though it represents actions he has already taken before. Eventually he learns the truth: He himself was a Nazi scientist who turned in his Jewish parents to the regime, and helped develop the very same technologies that AM uses to prolong their lives (the life serum) and alter their bodies (morphogenics). Nimdok redeems himself by helping the Jewish captives of the camp escape, and gives them control of a large golem, which they use to kill him for his past crimes. * Ted ‚Äì Ted is represented much like he is in the short story, but AM has apparently made him severely paranoid, playing on his past as a con artist where he would use his charm and looks to seduce rich single women out of money, while he lived in constant fear of finally being discovered and revealed as a fraud. Initially offered freedom if he can solve the puzzle in a dark room, this turns out to be a feint to further provoke his neuroses. He then finds himself in a medieval castle where his love Ellen is apparently slowly dying due to a spell cast on her by her wicked stepmother. The castle is full of deceptive characters who make contradictory demands and whom Ted cannot decide whether to trust, and surrounded by wolves who are slowly closing in. Ted eventually finds a way to redeem both himself and Ellen, and is presented with a door to the surface world, which is irradiated and uninhabitable. In a 2012 issue of Game Informer, Harlan Ellison, David Sears and David Mullich discussed the process that went into developing the game as well as the character developments and other changes that were made from the original story. For example, in writing the script for Ellen's confrontation with her rapist, Mullich channeled the memory he had of his infant son going through chemotherapy, being with him at the hospital and sharing a room with other young cancer patients. In discussing the characters changes made to Benny, Mullich said, \\"Looking back, I think it might have been a lost opportunity to write a story about someone struggling with the challenges of being homosexual.\\" Although Sears recalls that \\"gay angle\\" was in their initial script, but might have subsequently been a dropped thread. History =Development= Cyberdreams brought in writer David Sears to collaborate with Harlan Ellison. Sears, formerly a writer and assistant editor for Compute! magazine, had never before worked on a video game. Though a long-time fan of Ellison and his work, Sears was initially nervous and somewhat skeptical at his assignment: \\"...they said, 'No, it's I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, and I was like, 'What?'...At the time, in the game-development community, people said, 'Oh I love Ellison's stories, but there's no way you could turn that into a game.' I thought, 'Wow, what have I gotten into?'\\"Cork, Jeff. (2012, January). I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream. Game Informer, 225, 96-99. (digital version ) One of the biggest initial challenges was taking a short story whose characters have very limited background story and character development, and fleshing it out into a full- length interactive narrative. A breakthrough came about when Sears asked Ellison the question, \\"Why were these people saved? Why did AM decide to save them?\\" This brought about the decision to split the game into five separate narratives, each following a particular character and exploring why they had been selected to be tortured. Sears spent several weeks at Ellison's house, where they worked to flesh out the characters and their backgrounds. Producer David Mullich joined Cyberdreams shortly after Ellison and Sears drafted their treatment and Sears had gone on to a position at another software company. One of the first steps in making the project a reality was to expand the 130-page draft document into a comprehensive game design complete with all the interactions, logic and details necessary for the programmers and artists to begin their tasks. Mullich decided to complete the design himself, having created a 1980 computer game based upon The Prisoner television series which, like this adventure, involved a surreal environment, metaphorical story elements, and rewards for ethical behavior. After several months, he produced an 800-page game design document containing more than 2000 lines of additional dialogue. Mullich contracted the Dreamers Guild to do the programming, artwork and sound effects. Its S.A.G.A. game engine was seen as an ideal user interface for the player to interact with the environment and to converse with the characters in AM's world. It was decided early on that high resolution graphics were necessary to capture the nuances and mood of Ellison's vivid imagination, and so Technical Director John Bolton adapted the engine to utilize SVGA graphics and included the Fastgraph graphics library. Mullich and Cyberdreams art director Peter Delgado had frequent meetings with Dreamers Guild art director Brad Schenck to devise art direction complementing the surreal nature of the story. Since the story takes place in the mind of a mad god who can make anything happen, the team chose a variety of art styles for each of the scenarios, ranging from the unsettling perspectives used in German Expressionist films to pure fantasy to stark reality. Assistant art director Glenn Price and his team rendered more than 60 backgrounds utilizing a number of 2D and 3D tools, including Deluxe Paint and LightWave. Hundreds of animations were drawn by assistant art director Jhoneil Centeno and his team of animators. As the game approached a playable \\"alpha\\" state, Ellison and Mullich spent many hours together fine-tuning the scenarios and polishing the dialogue. Mullich commissioned film composer John Ottman (who would later work with director Bryan Singer in The Usual Suspects and X-Men) to write more than 25 pieces of original MIDI music for the adventure. Ellison himself also worked as a voice actor on the project, providing the voice for AM.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142392/fullcredits In pre-release publicity for I have No Mouth, and I Must Scream, Ellison said that it would be a game \\"you cannot possibly win\\". Though the gaming media found that the finished game backed away from this controversial promise, and Sears said that he had convinced Ellison that having a game with only negative endings was a bad idea, in a 2013 interview Ellison insisted that \\"I created it so you could not win it. The only way in which you could \\"win\\" was to play it nobly. The more nobly you played it, the closer to succeeding you would come, but you could not actually beat it. And that annoyed the hell out of people too.\\" Q&A;: Harlan Ellison , by Damien Walter, in the Guardian; published June 14, 2013; retrieved March 24, 2015 =Release= The game was published by Cyberdreams in October 31, 1995 for PCs with MS-DOS and Mac OS. A PlayStation version was planned to be released in Summer 1995, but was cancelled. Cyberdreams had developed a reputation, in the early 1990s, of selling computer games with science fiction-cyberpunk storylines and adult violent, sexual, philosophical, and psychological content. The French and German releases were partially censored and the game was forbidden to players younger than 18 years. Furthermore, the Nimdok chapter was removed, likely due to the Nazi theme - especially for Germany, due to previous reaction of the Federal Department for Media Harmful to Young Persons to National Socialist topics. The removal of the Nimdok chapter made achieving the \\"best\\" ending (with AM permanently disabled and the cryogenically frozen humans on Luna rescued) more complicated.Richard Cobbett, I Have No Mouth And I Must Scream , PC Gamer, September 1, 2012Cut or uncut? on gog.com \\"It is indeed possible, because you don‚Äòt actually need Nimdok [...] the others can simply guess it. Just try entering codes at random two or three times [...] and the correct answer will be available.\\" The game remained out of print abandonware for years due to the closure of both developer and publisher. In 2013, the rights were recovered by Night Dive Studios. Therefore, it was possible to re-release the game again as digital download on GOG.com in September 2013, and Steam in October 2013. Reception According to Charles Ardai of Computer Gaming World, I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream was commercially unsuccessful. Joe Pearce of The Dreamers Guild recalled that it was \\"a critical success but only a modest seller.\\" The game has an aggregate score of 77% at GameRankings, based on four reviews. Most reviews acclaimed the game's content and its mature presentation of ethical issues. The game was praised by Computer Player and Electronic Entertainment for its \\"nightmarish graphics, high-quality audio and troubling ethical dilemmas add up to a combination of the entertaining and the profound that could prove to be the foundation of an important gaming subgenre in the future,\\"Computer Player, December 1995 and asking \\"a lot from you in terms of the psychological and ethical choices you'll make during game play. For those familiar with Ellison's prolific writings, the moral dilemmas will come as no surprise.\\"Electronic Entertainment, December 1995 According to Computer Games Strategy Plus, \\"without appearing didactic, Ellison has the ability to hit us squarely in the face with a mirror reflecting the sorry lot that we humans have become. (...) In the mode of Franz Kafka, we are meant to be touched or changed in some way by this work, for what else is the purpose of art?\\"Computer Games Strategy Plus, January 1996 T. Liam McDonald of PC Gamer US wrote \\"there are moments that challenge and disturb, and this gives the characters and setting much more psychological depth than we've seen in any computer game to date.\\" He summed up his review by writing: \\"Ultimately, I Have No Mouth isn‚Äôt for everyone. But if you‚Äôve been searching for an adventure that‚Äôs both thoughtful and entertaining, and if you‚Äôre fond of Ellison‚Äôs disturbing fiction, it‚Äôs a must.\\"PC Gamer Online  I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream (PC Gamer January 1996). A reviewer for Next Generation commented on the game's surreal content and heavy concern \\"with ethics, humanity, and inner demons\\", but found the gameplay too limited, and summarized it as \\"less a game than an ethical obstacle course\\". Ron Dulin of GameSpot was much more critical, stating: \\"There are numerous dead ends and illogical puzzles [and] many programming bugs.\\" Dulin commended the game for experimenting with interesting concepts and enjoyed its dark art work and resemblance to the original book, but criticized it for how \\"the so-called 'ethical decisions' these five imprisoned souls must face are no more than red herrings, providing only stopping blocks to progress or disturbing scenes with no tangible purpose.\\" I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream won several awards, including \\"Best Dark Game of 1996\\" from Digital Hollywood and \\"Best Game Adapted from Linear Media\\" from the Computer Game Developers Conference. Computer Gaming World gave it their award for \\"Adventure Game of the Year\\" and also listed it as #134 on the \\"150 Games of All Time\\", and one of the \\"Best 15 Sleepers of All Time\\" and \\"Best 15 Endings of All Time\\".CGW 143 (June 1996) In the October 2014 issue of Game Informer it was listed as #22 of the staff's \\"Top 25 Horror Games of All Time\\".

Though he studied under Fromental Hal√©vy, and though his one-act comic opera Les Deux Billets was performed in 1868, Blanc's refined music lies in the Romantic Viennese tradition of hausmusik for private performance, music that was essentially peripheral to the public musical life of contemporary Paris, which was centered on opera, and as a result Blanc has been largely overlooked.

Its idealistic founder, Dr. N.P. alias Nanasaheb Parulekar had been influenced by American newspapers during his years at Columbia University. By introducing Sakal (morning) to advance Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs movement for independence, he also showed the path to genuine daily journalism in Marathi. Though it was started as a part of the nationalist cause, after Indian independence, Sakal newspaper established itself as a successful business by reporting on day-to-day concerns, not just of Pune but also of its rural neighborhoods. By the 1960s, Sakal appointed full-time correspondents, each with a telephone, in every town in its neighborhood. It ran training camps for its journalists, promotions and cultural events for its readers and letters to the editor on its front page. Under Nanasaheb Parulekar, the paper maintained strict political neutrality and endorsed candidates for local, state or National elections purely on the basis of their merit. When Dr. Parulekar died in 1973, he left the paper with many good practices and rich traditions. It survived the first shocks of India's revolution in newspaper technology and carried on for more than 10 years. Pratap Pawar took over Sakal in 1985. The Pawar family turned the paper into a public limited company in 1989, and Pratap Pawar became the managing director. =List of editors (HQ Pune) chronologically= * N. B.

The initiative was the company managing director Abhijit Pawar's brainchild and was taken to improve traffic condition of Pune city. For Pune Bus Day, Sakal Media Group has taken an initiative to arrange 1,500 buses to the existing fleet of 1,650 PMPML buses and demonstrate how the use of optimum number of buses with high frequency can actually reduce the traffic congestion which are rampant in the city. The tagline of the initiative is 'Come, let's travel by PMPML bus on 1 November 2012'. Presently, the lack of sufficient buses forces commuters to opt for private vehicles thus adding to problems like traffic congestion, vehicular pollution and increasing accidents. According to a study conducted by city-based NGO Parisar in 2009‚Äì10, the bus service run by the Pune Mahanagar Parivahan Mahamandal Limited (PMPML), was the most expensive, the worst in service and had the highest breakdown rate when compared to transport utilities run in Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru and Delhi.

King Huber, USGS Geological Survey Professional Paper 754-A The oldest existing shorelines were formed after retreat from the Greatlakean advance (previously called the Valders), sometime around 11,000 years B.P. Lake Duluth formed at the western end of the Lake Superior basin. Lake Duluth overflowed south through outlets in Minnesota and Wisconsin at an elevation of around 331 m above sea level. Map of Glacial Lakes Duluth, Chicago, and Lundy (USGS 1915) Predecessor lakes As the Superior lobe of the Laurentian Ice Sheet melted, water became trapped along the ice margin and formed several independent lakes. The modern water basins in which these lakes stood have been used for their names. Lake Nemadji occupied the headwaters of the Nemadji River, Lake Brule occupied part of the Brule River basin, and Lake Ontonagon was in the Ontonagon River basin.Professional Paper 154‚ÄîA, Moriaines and Shore Lines of Lake Superior Basin: Frank Leverett; United States Government Printing Office, Washington; February 9, 1929; (Pages 1-72) These lakes are all west of the Keweenaw Peninsula. To the east, the ice melt drained into Green Bay or Lake Michigan through channels crossing the western part of the upper peninsula of Michigan. Lake Duluth extended a few miles farther east than the Keweenaw Peninsula, to the border of the Huron Mountains, east of Keweenaw Bay. In the early part of the recession of the ice front Lake Duluth, with an outlet from the Brule River Valley through the St. Croix River Valley, was present in the western part of the Lake Superior Basin. A little later the ice border retreated sufficiently to allow the small independent lakes to become a part of Lake Duluth or to be drained by the lowering of the water level, for in general the water level was lowered as these lakes merged with Lake Duluth Lake St. Louis was one of the bordering lakes present when the Superior ice lobe was at its full extent. It stood in the part of the St. Louis River drainage basin northwest of the border of the Superior lobe. Lake Nemadji was an outlet channel leading west from the west end of the Lake Superior Basin to Moose Lake, where it joined the outlet of Lake St. Louis. Lake Brule was a small lake in the Brule River basin south of the copper range. It has its outlet to the St. Croix Valley. This was before Lake Duluth gained the St. Croix as its outlet. Lake Ashland occupied several townships in northwestern Ashland County, Wisconsin. It extended west in Bayfield County to the east slope of the Bayfield Peninsula. Lake Ontonagon occupied much of the Ontonagon basin, south of the copper range. The ice border remained along the copper range for a long period during its existence. Limits of the lake Map of Prehistoric lakes in the Great Lakes Basin at the end of the Wisconsin Ice EpochAs the ice lobe retreated northwards, the independent lakes listed above joined together, forming a single lake at the level of the St. Croix Valley outlet. It is probable that several small glacial lakes in succession, Lakes Nemadji, Ashland, and Ontonagon, merged at lower levels with that of Lake Brule. Lake Nemadji and Lake Ashland dropped less than . Lake Ontonagon dropped nearly . Its area is now land. Several narrow bays of Lake Duluth, extended up each of the tributaries of Ontonagon River south of the copper range. The ice lobe retreated eastward in the Superior basin, taking a long period of time to completely leave the basin. During the process, the outlet continued to deepen and the beaches around the lake continued to drop. Thus, the higher beaches in the eastern portion of the basin are extension of middle and lower beaches in the western basin. The eastern limits of Lake Duluth on the south shore have been found to be at the Huron Mountains, in Marquette County, Michigan. Once the ice receded to the east of the mountains, new outlets opened across the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, carrying the melt water into the Lake Michigan basin. Lake Duluth was lowered as lower lines drainage along the ice front. Eventually the water level reached that of Lake Algonquin. The body of water occupied the western part of the Lake Superior basin as well as the basins of Lake Michigan and Lake Huron and finally the eastern part of the Lake Superior basin. The eastern limits of Lake Duluth on the north coast of Lake Superior have not been determined. It is known, however, that the lake extended at least to the Kaministiquia River basin west of Fort William, Ontario. It is probable that there was a protrusion of the ice into Keweenaw Bay at the time of greatest expansion of Lake Duluth, and the east end of the Keweenaw Peninsula may have been beneath the ice down to the time the Lake Duluth waters were drained eastward.

Owned by Fifth Street Enterprises, LLC, it broadcasts from the WQED's antenna tower in the Oakland area of Pittsburgh. Until 2015, the station was licensed to Johnstown, Pennsylvania. It is famous for televising a live auction for two years from 2001 to 2002. The station is not carried on any local cable TV system or DBS provider in the Pittsburgh area. History and Programming W35AZ signed on in the early 1990s on analog channel 35. It was a Network One affiliate for the life of the short-lived network. After the demise of Network One, the station became an affiliate of America's Collectibles Network. In 2001, it changed its call letters to WONT-LP, and started broadcasting live programming from its studios, which at the time were located at the Eastland Mall in North Versailles, Pennsylvania. WANT-TV was a live auction of salvage merchandise that ran from 7 PM until midnight daily. Originally, the show had multiple hosts, but by the first six months of the show, Cheryl McCall became the show's main host. As a low-budget, live six-hour show, the show gained a cult following from college students and over the air viewers in the Pittsburgh area. In mid-2001, WANT-TV was renamed Live Auction Television, and its hours were reduced to three days a week (Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) from 7 PM to 1 am. Also, WONT ended its affiliation with ACN, and became an affiliate of the Shop at Home Network. In 2002, the show was renamed Auction Live, and started being simulcast on its sister stations at the time, WIIC-LP and WPTG-LP. During this time, the station changed its callsign from WONT-LP to \\"WBYD-CA\\", and became a Class A LPTV station. In August 2002, Auction Live went on hiatus due to declining sales of merchandise on the show. It returned two months later, but the show ceased airing by the end of 2002. WBYD-CA then began showing limited locally originated programming, including a local talk show created by the Pittsburgh-based band American Metal. In 2005, the owner of the Eastland Mall, Benderson Development, announced the mall was going to be demolished, and cancelled the leases of all the remaining tenants, including WBYD. The station was moved to a trailer next to the broadcast tower of WQED. WBYD-CA requested and was granted by the FCC a STA to go silent in early 2013 for financial reasons, since the owner of the station at the time (Abacus Television) was unable to build digital facilities at the same time paying to operate the analog facilities. On May 15, 2015, the station returned to the air, initially rebroadcasting the feed of WOSC-CD, on its new channel, channel 39. In August 2015, it started broadcasting Jewelry TV on its main channel 39.1, and added 39.2 shortly afterwards, which is a subchannel of infomercials. WBYD-CA was owned by Abacus Television until it was sold, along with four other TV stations, to Fifth Street Enterprises, LLC in April 2015.

The screenplay by Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond is based on the play L'ora della fantasia (The Dazzling Hour) by Anna Bonacci, which had inspired Wife for a Night (Moglie per una notte, 1952), an Italian film starring Gina Lollobrigida. The comic song lyrics were written by Ira Gershwin, using some of George Gershwin's unpublished melodies. Plot While driving his Dual- Ghia from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, lecherous, heavy-drinking pop singer Dino (Dean Martin) is forced to detour through Climax, Nevada. There he meets the amateur songwriting team of Barney Millsap (Cliff Osmond), a gas station attendant, and piano teacher Orville J. Spooner (Ray Walston), a man easily given to jealousy. Hoping to interest Dino in their songs, Barney disables the \\"Italian\\" sports car and tells Dino he will need to remain in town until new parts arrive from Milan. (Dual-Ghia was actually an American marque, mating a Dodge frame, drivetrain, and engine with Italian coachwork.) Orville invites Dino to stay with him and wife Zelda (Felicia Farr), but becomes concerned when he learns the singer needs to have sex every night to avoid awakening with a headache. Anxious to accommodate Dino but safeguard his marriage, Orville provokes an argument with his wife that leads to Zelda fleeing in tears. He and Barney then arrange for Polly the Pistol (Kim Novak), a waitress and prostitute at a saloon on the edge of town called the Belly Button, to pose as Orville's wife and satisfy Dino. That evening after the three have dinner, Orville plays his tunes for Dino on the piano and Polly requests a particular song. It is one she knows he wrote for his wife when trying to persuade her to marry him. Doing so, Orville gets lost in emotion, as does Polly, who has fallen a little for the dream of a domestic life that she doesn't have. Under the influence of wine and song, Orville starts thinking of Polly as his wife and tosses Dino out. He then spends the night with Polly. Dino seeks shelter at the Belly Button, where Zelda earlier had gone to drown her sorrows. When she became drunk and rowdy, the manager deposited her in Polly's trailer to sleep. Hearing about the talents of Polly the Pistol and declaring himself eager \\"to shoot it out with her,\\" Dino goes to the trailer and finds Zelda there and mistakes her for Polly. A longtime fan, she succumbs to Dino's charms and allows him to seduce her, persuading him how perfect Orville's song would be for him at the same time. Zelda meets Polly the next morning and figures out the trick Orville played on her. She gives Dino's money to Polly, who needs it to leave Climax and start a new life. A few nights later, Orville is distraught knowing that Zelda intends to divorce him. Suddenly he hears Dino singing one of his songs on coast-to-coast television. He is at a total loss as to how this could have happened. He wants an explanation, but Zelda simply orders him: \\"Kiss me, stupid.\\" Cast (right) Kim Novak Production Wilder initially offered the role of Orville Spooner to Jack Lemmon (Farr's real life husband), whom he had directed in Some Like It Hot, The Apartment, and Irma la Douce, but prior commitments forced the actor to decline. The director then signed Peter Sellers for the role. Six weeks into filming, Sellers suffered a series of 13 heart attacks and was hospitalized in Cedars of Lebanon Hospital. Upon his release, the actor returned to England under doctor's orders. Unwilling to wait while Sellers completed a six-month recuperation period, Wilder opted to replace him and reshoot all his scenes.Article on \\"Kiss Me, Stupid (1964)\\" by John M. Miller, at Turner Classic Movies. The role of Polly the Pistol was written with Marilyn Monroe in mind. After her death in August 1962, filming was postponed while the role was recast. It was later reported that Jayne Mansfield would take over the role, but she had to withdraw from the project because of her pregnancy with future actress Mariska Hargitay. Sometime thereafter, it was decided that Kim Novak would play the role, coming out of a two-year absence from acting to appear in the film. Wilder approached friend Ira Gershwin and asked if he would like to collaborate on the songs written by Barney and Orville. Gershwin suggested he write lyrics to unpublished music by his late brother George, and as a result three new songs by the Gershwins ‚Äì \\"Sophia,\\" \\"I'm a Poached Egg,\\" and \\"All the Livelong Day\\" ‚Äì debuted in the film. The film was shot on location in Twentynine Palms, California. The opening sequence was filmed at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, using a portion of Dean Martin's actual show and the hotel's marquee from his appearance there. Some interior scenes were filmed in the Moulin Rouge night club in Los Angeles. The car that Martin drove was his own. The Catholic Legion of Decency strongly objected to the completed film. Wilder was willing to soften the suggestion Zelda had committed adultery with Dino, but he refused to comply with other demands, and the film was condemned, the first American film to be so designated since Baby Doll in 1956. As a direct result of the rating, United Artists decided to release the film under the banner of Lopert Pictures, a subsidiary previously used for imported films. In 2002 a print was shown in several U.S. cities containing the originally-shot seduction scene in Polly's trailer (seen in European exhibition), rather than the tamer replacement Wilder has supplied in hope of satisfying the Catholic Legion of Decency.Desowitz, Bill. \\"Reviving 'Kiss Me, Stupid' is a No-Brainer.\\" Los Angeles Times, 20 August 2002.Petrakis, John. \\"Key Scene Reinserted Into 'Kiss Me, Stupid'.\\" Chicago Tribune, 23 August 2002. Wilder rarely mentioned the film in later interviews, although he discussed it briefly for On Sunset Boulevard: The Life and Times of Billy Wilder, a biography by Ed Sikov. \\"I don't know why the film shocked people. It's the most bourgeois film there is,\\" he declared. \\"A man wants a career and the person who wants to help him wants to sleep with his wife. He replaces his wife with another, but when he is nearest to success, he refuses it and throws the guy out . . . The public accepted it better in The Apartment because it was better conceived, better written, better lubricated.\\" Wilder also discussed Kiss Me, Stupid in director Cameron Crowe's 1998 book Conversations With Wilder, citing his admiration for Dean Martin, saying \\"there was much more, 90 percent more, to him than just the jokester. I am a sucker for Dean Martin. I thought he was the funniest man in Hollywood.\\" The movie's use of an unflattering version of Dean Martin (\\"Dino\\") was a forerunner of the current trend of celebrities doing comic send-ups of themselves on film. Critical reception Like The Carpetbaggers of the same year, the film was widely considered to be vulgar by critics. It became one of the targets for denunciations of the negative impact of films on society. Bosley Crowther blamed both films for giving American movies the reputation of \\"deliberate and degenerate corruptors of public taste and morals\\". A. H. Weiler of the New York Times called the film \\"pitifully unfunny\\" and \\"obvious, plodding, short on laughs and performances and long on vulgarity.\\" He added, \\"The finesse, speed, artistry and imagination of . . . Some Like It Hot are sadly missing in this pungent exercise. Instead, we have cheapness that will not shock a grownup. However, this heavy-handed sex fable does call for a light, subtle approach that is rarely apparent.\\"A.H. Weiler (December 23, 1964). \\"Kiss Me Stupid (1964)\\". New York Times. The Time review called the film \\"a jape that seems to have scraped its blue-black humor off the floor of a honky-tonk nightclub\\" and \\"professionally shrewd and zippy [with] a kind of vulgar integrity.\\" It concluded, \\"The result, spelled out in dialogue that sounds like a series of gamy punch lines, is one of the longest traveling-salesman stories ever committed to film. Like all dirty jokes, it will probably evoke a shock wave of self-conscious laughter and pass swiftly into oblivion.\\"\\"Cinema: Hipster's Harlot\\". Time. January 1, 1965. Variety said the script \\"calls for a generous seasoning of No√´l Coward but, unfortunately, it provides a dash of same only now and again . . . Wilder, usually a director of considerable flair and inventiveness (if not always impeccable taste), has not been able this time out to rise above a basically vulgar, as well as creatively delinquent, screenplay, and he has got at best only plodding help from two of his principals, Dean Martin and Kim Novak . . . [He] has directed with frontal assault rather than suggestive finesse.\\"\\"Review: ‚ÄòKiss Me, Stupid‚Äô\\". Variety. December 31, 1963. Michael Scheinfeld of TV Guide rated the film 3¬Ω out of four stars, calling it \\"a kind of cinematic litmus test that separates the casual Billy Wilder fan from the true connoisseur\\" and \\"a monument of satirical tastelessness that . . . in retrospect, is now seen as one of Wilder's most fascinatingly original films.\\" He added, \\"Amid the [original] furor, it's easy to miss the film's comedic accomplishments, which are considerable. Its idiomatic wordplay and social satire is vintage Wilder, and the opening sequence where Dino performs in a nightclub is one of the funniest things that Wilder has ever done. Sprinkling in bad jokes and Rat Pack references, Dean Martin's comic timing and delivery is impeccable . . . The rest of the cast is equally superb, right down to the smallest bit part . . . although Ray Walston's relentless mugging becomes a bit much.\\"Michael Scheinfeld. \\"Kiss Me, Stupid: Review\\". TV Guide. In 2002, J. Hoberman of The Village Voice discussed the film when Film Forum in Manhattan ran a restored print. He observed, \\"The first half is an unending parade of smutty gags and single entendres, with a few toilet jokes thrown in for good measure. The constant tumult in the Spooners' cramped bungalow betrays the movie's stage origins, and indeed, Climax itself is an appropriately desolate stage-set. Kiss Me, Stupid is likely Wilder's harshest view of the American landscape since the orchestrated media feeding frenzy of Ace in the Hole . . . The rancid atmosphere conceals the virtues of the movie's classical structure, detailed mise-en-sc√®ne, and deft comic timing . . . Kiss Me, Stupid's mutually redemptive adultery is closer to the grown-up world of John Cassavetes's Faces than to Wilder's adolescent Seven Year Itch ‚Äî but it's ultimately a more knowingly tolerant, not to mention funnier, movie than either.\\"J. Hoberman. (June 18, 2002). \\"Zero for Conduct\\". Village Voice. Home Media Olive Films released the film on DVD and Blu-Ray February 17, 2015.

Biography Born to a samurai family in the Satsuma Domain (present-day Kagoshima Prefecture), Kamimura served as a foot soldier during the Boshin War. After the Imperial government was established in 1871, Kamimura became one of the first cadets of the Imperial Japanese Naval Academy, later earning a commission as an ensign following his graduation in 1879. Shimamura, Togo, Kamimura, Kat≈ç, Akiyama Serving as a junior officer aboard various ships throughout the 1880s, Kamimura‚Äôs first command was the gunboat in 1891; he later captained the in 1893. After the outbreak of the First Sino-Japanese War the following year, Kamimura was given command of the new cruiser , winning distinction at the Battle of the Yalu River on 17 September 1894.Paine, The Sino-Japanese War In his heyday, he was known throughout Imperial Navy as a gruff and bold combat leader in the old samurai tradition. In the years following the war, Kamimura held a series of posts in the Navy Ministry as well as staff and fleet commands until his promotion to vice admiral in 1903. He visited Great Britain aboard the battleship from 1 February 1899 ‚Äì 22 May 1900, during which time he became a rear admiral. Placed in command of the IJN 2nd Fleet following the first months of the Russo-Japanese War, Kamimura was ordered to contain the Russian cruiser squadron based in Vladivostok. After the Russians escaped and sank Japanese troopships in the Sea of Japan (April and June 1904), he became the object of widespread popular dissatisfaction, with a mob attacking his Tokyo residence, and newspapers hinting that he should commit suicide. He vindicated himself in action by sinking the Russian cruiser and damaging the cruisers and on 14 August 1904 at the Battle off Ulsan, and regained his popularity both within the government and the Japanese public. Commanding from the cruiser , Kamimura later led the IJN 2nd Fleet during the Battle of Tsushima on 27 May 1905. Appointed commander of the Yokosuka Naval Base in 1905, Kamimura was placed in command of the IJN 1st Fleet in 1909. Previously made a danshaku (baron) under the kazoku peerage system only two years before, Kamimura was made a full admiral on 1 December 1910. Becoming a member of the Supreme War Council the following year, Kamimura entered the reserve list on 1 May 1914, before his death in 1916. His grave is at the temple of My≈çhon-ji in Kamakura.

Life Leggett attended Georgetown College in 1815‚Äì16. In 1819, after his father's business failed, he moved with his family to Edwardsville, Illinois. In late 1822, he returned to New York to take up a naval commission as a midshipman. He served in the United States Navy in the West Indies and Mediterranean. In January 1825, Leggett was imprisoned by his captain for dueling on duty. Several months later, a court martial convicted him of several offenses. His sentence of dismissal from the navy was reduced to time served, but he resigned his commission on April 17, 1826. After his resignation, Leggett returned to New York to become a theater critic at the New York Mirror and assistant editor of the short-lived Merchants' Telegraph. In November 1828, he founded the Critic, a literary journal that lasted only until June 1829. In the summer of 1829, however, William Cullen Bryant invited Leggett to write for the New York Evening Post. There, in addition to literary and drama reviews, he began to write political editorials. Leggett became an owner and editor at the Post in 1831, eventually working as sole editor of the newspaper while Bryant traveled in Europe in 1834‚Äì5. Leggett's political opinions proved highly controversial. He was a Jacksonian Democrat, but he often attacked fellow Andrew Jackson supporters for failing to carry their egalitarian principles far enough. He also became an outspoken opponent of slavery. Because the resulting struggles threatened both Leggett's health and the financial survival of the newspaper, Bryant returned from Europe, and Leggett left the Post. Leggett founded The Plaindealer in 1836 and the Examiner in 1837, but both publications lasted only a few months. Their failure left Leggett in poverty. Leggett had suffered poor health since contracting yellow fever in the navy. He died at his home in New Rochelle, New York on May 29, 1839, just before he was due to begin serving as the American minister to Guatemala under Martin Van Buren. He is interred at New Rochelle's Trinity Church. His monument there was carved by John Frazee. Positions He is best known as an unflinching advocate of laissez-faire, and a leader of the Loco-Focos faction of city Democrats. He insisted: > Governments have no right to interfere with the pursuits of individuals, as > guaranteed by those general laws, by offering encouragements and granting > privileges to any particular class of industry, or any select bodies of men, > inasmuch as all classes of industry and all men are equally important to the > general welfare, and equally entitled to protection.Doctrine of Equal Rights > 1834 Leggett was remarkable among the journalists of his day as an unflinching advocate of freedom of opinion for his political opponents as well as for his own party. Bryant wrote a poem to his memory,In Memory of William Leggett beginning \\"The earth may ring from shore to shore.\\" Bryant describes Leggett as fond of study, delighting to trace principles to their remotest consequences, and having no fear of public opinion regarding the expression of his own convictions. It was the fiery Leggett that urged on Bryant to attack William Leete Stone, Sr., a brother editor, in Broadway. Soon afterward he fought a duel at Weehawken with Blake, the treasurer of the old Park Theatre. To the surprise of all New York, Leggett selected James Lawson, a peacefully disposed Scottish-American poet, who was slightly lame, as his second; and when asked after the bloodless duel for his reasons, he answered: \\"Blake's second, Berkeley, was lame, and I did not propose that the d--d Englishman should beat me in anything.\\" William Cullen Bryant, in his obituary, wrote: Writings Leggett's writings include Leisure Hours at Sea (1825); Tales and Sketches of a Country School Master (1835); Naval Stories (1835); and Political Writings, edited, with a preface, by Theodore Sedgwick (1840).Bryant and His Friends, James Grant Wilson (New York, 1886) Tales and Sketches of a Country School Master includes \\"The Rifle\\" (originally in The Atlantic Souvenir, Christmas and New Year's Offering [1827], an early pre-Poe use of elements that would appear in detective fiction. His main editorials have been collected as Democratick Editorials: Essays in Jacksonian Political Economy (1984) In popular culture * Leggett appears in the novel Burr by Gore Vidal as a mentor to the main character, aspiring journalist Charlie Schuyler. * A poem was written by John Greenleaf Whittier commemorating \\"Leggett's Monument\\" as a symbol of his consistently outspoken nature and the callousness of society to his opinions.

The word kaisar, meaning \\"emperor\\" is a derivative of the Roman imperial title Caesar, via Persian (see Qaysar-i Rum) from Greek ŒöŒ±ŒØœÉŒ±œÅ Ka√≠sar, and is cognate with the German title Kaiser, which was borrowed from Latin at an earlier date.See Witzel, Michael, \\"Autochthonous Aryans? The Evidence from Old Indian and Iranian Texts\\", p. 29, 12.1 PDF Based upon this, the title Kaisar-i-Hind was coined in 1876 by the orientalist G.W. Leitner as the official imperial title for the British monarch in India.B.S. Cohn, \\"Representing Authority in Victorian India\\", in E. Hobsbawm and T. Ranger (eds.), The Invention of Tradition (1983), 165-209, esp. 201-2. The last ruler to bear it was George VI.

Leitner in a deliberate attempt to dissociate British imperial rule from that of preceding dynasties was taken by Queen Victoria from 1 May 1876, and proclaimed at the Delhi Durbar of 1877. The medal was instituted by Queen Victoria on 10 April 1900. The name translates as \\"Emperor of India\\" (a name also used for a rare Indian butterfly, Teinopalpus imperialis). The Royal Warrant for the Kaisar-i-Hind was amended in 1901, 1912, 1933 and 1939. While never officially rescinded, the Kaisar-i-Hind ceased to be awarded following the passage of the Indian Independence Act 1947. The awards of the gold medal were often published in the London Gazette, while other classes were published in the Gazette of India. Medal grades and design The medal had three grades. The Kaisar-i-Hind Gold Medal for Public Service in India was awarded directly by the monarch on the recommendation of the Secretary of State for India. Silver and Bronze medals were awarded by the Viceroy. The medal consisted of an oval-shaped badge or decoration in gold, silver or bronze with the Royal Cipher and Monarchy on one side, and the words \\"Kaisar-i-Hind for Public Service in India\\" on the other. It was to be worn suspended from the left breast by a dark blue ribbon. The medal has no post- nominal initials. Its most famous recipient is Mohandas Gandhi, who was awarded the Kaisar-i-Hind in 1915 by The Lord Hardinge of Penshurst for his contribution to ambulance services in South Africa. Gandhi returned the medal in 1920 as part of the national campaign protesting the Jallianwala Bagh massacre and in support of the Khilafat Movement.

The game is loosely based on the 1991 made-for-television American film Adventures in Dinosaur City by Smart Egg Pictures, and borrows many of the film's characters, settings, and basic plot while providing its own unique art direction and style. Initially released in July 1992 for Japanese audiences, the game was later made available in North America the following September. The game centers on two friends, Timmy and Jamie, young children who are accidentally transported to a world resembling prehistoric Earth populated by anthropomorphic dinosaurs. While a device which will allow them to return home exists in this environment, a critical component has been stolen by Mr. Big, leader of a gang of Neanderthals known as The Rockeys, leaving the player to guide Timmy or Jamie to his castle to retrieve it. They are assisted by Rex, a Tyrannosaurus, and Tops, a Protoceratops, each with their own play-styles. Gameplay A player controlling Tops and Jamie DinoCity is a traditional platformer-style action game where the player must move their character from left to right across the screen while avoiding obstacles, jumping on platforms, and defeating enemies. Players are given the choice of controlling Rex with Timmy or Tops with Jamie at the beginning of the game as well as at the start of each new level. While Tops can throw darts to damage enemies from a distance, Rex is confined to close combat by punching them or swinging his tail. Each dinosaur character can defeat enemies by jumping on them, and at any point the player may relegate control to their human riders, who can freeze enemies in place by using a special energy device. While controlling the children, the dinosaurs become immobile and may be used as platforms themselves to reach otherwise inaccessible items. The game supports up to two players who are given alternating turns at play each time the other loses a life. In order to pass each of the game's six levels (and one secret level), players must navigate through a number of screens joined by doors. Each screen resembles a different environment, and can include caves, jungles, grasslands, ice caverns, volcanoes, or cities. Once a player has passed enough screens they must battle a boss character before advancing. If a character loses enough lives, they are given the option to continue up to three times before the game is over. During gameplay a player may collect eggs which grant an extra life if enough are obtained, as well as hearts that restore lost health. The game utilizes a password system that allows players to return to the start of any level from the title screen. Development DinoCity was developed and published by Irem Corporation in 1992, and was led by project directors K. Okada and Y. Takashima. The game was based on the American film Adventures in Dinosaur City which has been released worldwide earlier that year, with the Japanese title Dinowars Ky≈çry≈´ ≈åkoku e no Daib≈çken being the same name as the Japanese version of the movie. While many of the game's characters including the heroes Rex, Tops, Timmy, Jamie and villains Mr. Big and The Rockeys were taken directly from the film, they were largely re-designed into a more anime- based style by staff artists using the pseudonyms \\"Munou no Hito\\" and \\"SDR 200\\". Much of the game's art direction utilizes a colorful, cartoon-like approach to environments and enemies as opposed to the darker presentation of the original film. The music for DinoCity was produced by Irem in-house composer Hiroshi Ebihara, who had previously collaborated on the score to Super R-Type. Although no official soundtrack was released, select tracks were made available for listening from in-game sound test menu accessible from the title screen. The North American version was originally marketed by Irem America under the title \\"Dinosaurs\\" shortly after the game's Japanese release in July, with the finalization of the game's title coming just before its English release. Although the title was originally marked for an August release, it would later be pushed back to the following September. Beginning in early 1993, Irem America held a magazine promotion where players could receive an official DinoCity t-shirt featuring Rex by sending in two UPC labels from specified Irem games. =Version differences= While the majority of the game remains unchanged from one region release to another, a few graphic and gameplay changes exist between the English and original Japanese versions of the game. The cavewomen enemy character \\"Cindy\\" was originally designed as a large-busted woman whose character sprite was altered for the North American release due to Nintendo of America's policy against overly- sexual depictions of women on their consoles. The Japanese version also includes the option to select \\"Normal\\" or \\"Hard\\" difficulty settings at the beginning of the game. While the Hard setting represents the default play mode on the English version, the Normal setting grants the player five health points instead of three, as well as unlimited continues. Reception DinoCity received mostly good to average reviews during its North American release. Electronic Gaming Monthly was impressed with the game's \\"colorful\\" graphics and \\"cute\\" character designs, stating that it \\"seems geared for kids, but adults can play too.\\" However, the magazine ultimately declared that \\"although [the game] enjoys some of the nicest SNES wallpaper yet, the theme is less than while the pace remains stuck in molasses ... the overall execution of this title was cooler than it should be.\\" GamePro magazine similarly declared that \\"the colorful cartoon-style graphics create an ancient, humorous atmosphere ... thematically the game seems aimed at the younger set.\\" Despite its target demographic, the magazine still found it to be challenging enough for \\"intermediate adventurers.\\" Nintendo Power praised the game's \\"colorful and very detailed\\" graphics and \\"very good\\" music, but found the overall experience to be \\"a little too difficult for beginning players.\\" A more contemporary review of DinoCity from the website Allgame was largely in agreement with earlier editors, referring to it as \\"a (relatively) challenging and interesting game featuring a mind-boggling variety of levels.\\" The game's vibrant graphics were once again touched upon, with the website calling them \\"not only adorable, [but] sophisticated as well. The backgrounds vary greatly from level to level and the characters are nicely animated and drawn in a cartoon-like manner. Also, the game is colorful to the extreme.\\". IGN placed the game tenth on its \\"Top 10 Prehistoric Games\\" list in February 2007, stating that \\"If you never got a chance to play Dino City on the SNES, we feel bad for you.\\" DinoCity maintains a 69% average score from the aggregate review website GameRankings. Entertainment Weekly gave the game a B+ and wrote that \\"With a tail-wagging reptile straight out of Super Mario World, cavemen reminiscent of the Flintstones, and peril-laden scenery popularized by countless action games, most kids will find DinoCity instantly familiar. Whether or not they enjoy it will depend on their tolerance for cutesy-poo characters (in this case, a small boy and his dinosaur pal) and a pace more thoughtful than frenetic. DinoCity is the perfect introductory cartridge for post-kindergarteners, a brief way station of innocence before they discover the joys of video games' heavy armament.\\"https://ew.com/article/1992/11/06/dinocity/ Notes References External links * Category:1992 video games Category:Dinosaurs in video games Category:Irem games Category:Platform games Category:Video games featuring female protagonists Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Super Nintendo Entertainment System-only games Category:Video games based on films Category:Video games developed in Japan Category:Video games scored by Hiroshi Kimura ","title":"DinoCity"},{"id":"3654890","text":"Mikhail Konstantinovich Shcherbakov (; born on March 27, 1963) is a prominent Russian poet, songwriter and bard.

Life A son of Bagrat Khan, Simon was a Georgian convert to Islam. He was brought up Muslim in Isfahan, Persia. On the death of his father in 1619, Simon, still in his minority, was installed by Shah Abbas I as a khan of Kartli. A Georgian noble, also a convert, Giorgi Saakadze, was appointed as a vekil (regent) and vizier to him. Largely unpopular with his Christian subjects, Simon's \\"khanate\\" never stretched beyond the capital Tbilisi and the Lower Kartli province, where the districts of Somkhiti and Sabaratiano were occupied by Persian forces. In March 1625, Saakadze sided with the opposition in Kartli and the neighbouring Kakheti. He led Georgian forces that destroyed a Persian army at the Battle of Martqopi. Simon and his Persians fled from Tbilisi to the fortress of Aghjakala in Lower Kartli: the rebels gave Kartli to king Teimuraz I of Kakheti. On July 1 of 1625, the Persians defeated the Georgians at the Battle of Marabda. A Persian general, Isa Khan, reinstated Simon in Tbilisi, but significant parts of Kartli remained under the control of Teimuraz and Saakadze. Shah Abbas utilised the rivalry among the rebel leaders to divide them. Soon after 1626, one of the rebel nobles and a powerful mountain lord, Zurab, Duke of Aragvi defected to Simon. Zurab later made a secret alliance with the insurgents. In 1630, he murdered the sleeping khan. Zurab sent Simon's severed head to Teimuraz, who later regained authority in Kartli.

Sterling (born Donald Tokowitz, April 26, 1934) is an American attorney and businessman who was the owner of the Los Angeles Clippers (initially San Diego Clippers) professional basketball franchise of the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1981 to 2014. In April 2014, Sterling was banned from the NBA for life and fined $2.5 million by the league after private recordings of him making racist comments were made public. In May, Sterling's wife Shelly reached an agreement for the Sterling Family Trust to sell the Clippers for $2 billion to Steve Ballmer, which Sterling contested in court. The NBA Board of Governors approved the sale of the Clippers to Ballmer on August 12, 2014. Sterling settled his lawsuit against the NBA in November 2016 and remains active in Los Angeles real estate. Early life Donald Sterling was born Donald Tokowitz on April 26, 1934, in Chicago, Illinois.Up and Down in Beverly Hills, 04.17.00 - Franz Lidz Sports Illustrated His family moved to the Boyle Heights area of Los Angeles when he was two years old. His parents, Susan and Mickey, were Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants.Haaretz: \\"Jewish groups condemn Donald Sterling remarks\\" April 28, 2014.Daily Jewish Forward: \\"NBA's Donald Sterling Tells Girlfriend, 'In Israel, Blacks Are Treated Like Dogs'\\" April 28, 2014. He attended Theodore Roosevelt High School in Los Angeles, where he was on the school's gymnastics team and served as class president; he graduated in 1952. He next attended California State University, Los Angeles (Class of 1956) and Southwestern University School of Law (Class of 1960) in Los Angeles. When he was 25, he and his wife Shelly changed their surname to \\"Sterling\\", filing a formal petition to do so on December 9, 1959. They cited the difficulty among his peers to pronounce \\"Tokowitz\\" and the belief that there would be financial benefits for the change. Legal and real estate career The Sterling Plaza in Beverly Hills, California In 1961, Sterling started his career as a divorce and personal injury attorney, building an independent practice when Jews had fewer opportunities at prestigious law firms. His biggest ventures were in real estate, which he began when he purchased a 26-unit apartment building in Beverly Hills. In the 1960s, Sterling also purchased Lesser Towers, a pair of large apartment buildings in the Westwood area of Los Angeles, and renamed them the Sterling Towers (now the Sterling International Towers). In 1976, he leased the California Bank Building on Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly Hills, and renamed it Sterling Plaza. The Art Deco landmark was built in 1930 by MGM cofounder Louis B. Mayer. In 2000, Sports Illustrated senior writer Franz Lidz revealed that Sterling had a 99-year lease with the Mayer estate that required him to pay a relatively small annual fee and 15% of any rental income, which was why Sterling had remained the sole tenant. \\"With no other tenant,\\" Lidz reported, \\"the Mayer estate faces another 75 years with virtually no income from its Sterling Plaza property. By sitting and waiting, Sterling may force a fire sale.\\"Marc Wanamaker, Beverly Hills: 1930-2005, Arcadia Publishing, 2006 As of April 2014, he owned 162 properties in Los Angeles.Adrian Glick Kudler, The Revealing Map of Donald Sterling's 162 Donald Sterling Properties, LA Curbed, April 29, 2014 NBA ownership Sterling and Los Angeles Lakers majority owner Jerry Buss were each indirectly responsible for the other owning his respective NBA franchise. The first instance came in 1979, when Buss used the money he made from selling a portion of his apartment buildings to Sterling (worth $2.7 million), which covered the remaining balance in purchasing the Lakers, the Kings hockey team, and The Los Angeles Forum from Jack Kent Cooke for $67 million. Two years later, Buss suggested to Sterling that he could purchase his own NBA franchise, and Sterling bought the struggling San Diego Clippers for $12.5 million. At his introductory news conference in San Diego, Sterling vowed to \\"spend unlimited sums\\" to build the Clippers into a contender, and he embarked on a county-wide marketing campaign featuring his smiling face on billboards and the backs of buses. The seminal ads read: \\"My Promise: I will make you proud of the Clippers\\". Unlike Buss' instant success with the Lakers (including winning an NBA championship in his first season as owner, 1979‚Äì80), Sterling and his Clippers struggled through many lackluster seasons, and they did not have their first winning season until the 1991‚Äì92 season, 11 years into his ownership. In Sterling's 33 years of owning the Clippers through 2013‚Äì14, the Clippers lost 50 or more games 22 times, 60 or more on eight occasions, and 70 games once. Their 9‚Äì41 record in the lockout-shortened 1998‚Äì99 season projected to another 60-loss season. The NBA in 1982 fined Sterling $10,000, the largest sum ever levied against an owner at the time, after he commented that he would accept the Clippers finishing in last place in order to draft an impact player like Ralph Sampson. In June 1982, Sterling attempted to move the team to Los Angeles. This prompted an investigation of the Clippers by an NBA committee of six owners. In September, the group recommended that Sterling's ownership be terminated, having found that he was late in paying creditors and players. Days before a league scheduled vote in October to remove Sterling, he agreed to sell the team, and the league sought buyers who would keep the franchise in San Diego. At the suggestion of David Stern, then the league's vice president, Sterling handed over operations of the team to Alan Rothenberg, who became the team's president. By February 1983, Stern called the Clippers a \\"first-class\\" franchise, and the ouster of Sterling was no longer pursued. Encouraged by friend Al Davis' victory over the National Football League in an antitrust lawsuit that allowed him to move his Oakland Raiders to Los Angeles without league approval, Sterling moved the Clippers from San Diego to Los Angeles in 1984. However, the move was not approved by the NBA, which fined him $25 million. He sued the league for $100 million, but dropped the suit when the league agreed to decrease the fine to $6 million. Sterling was widely criticized for his frugal operation of the Clippers, due in part to a consistent history of losing seasons. The club was long considered the laughingstock of the NBA. With the Clippers' move into Staples Center in the 1999‚Äì2000 NBA season, the team began to become a contender, winning 47 games in the 2005‚Äì06 season. This was a record for the most victories in a single season since the franchise moved to California. It was also only the second winning season in Sterling's tenure as owner. In the lockout-shortened 2011‚Äì2012 season they made the playoffs with the best winning percentage in their history (.606) and they won their first round series against the Memphis Grizzlies, 4‚Äì3, before being swept by the San Antonio Spurs, 4‚Äì0, in the conference semi-finals. Led by Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, the Clippers posted two more winning campaigns in 2012‚Äì13 and 2013‚Äì14, setting new franchise records for regular-season wins with 56 and 57, respectively. Sterling rebuffed numerous offers from other cities to relocate the Clippers and was steadfast in his refusal to move the team out of Los Angeles, let alone sell the team. While the team played a few games in Anaheim in the Arrowhead Pond (now the Honda Center) for a few years before the Staples Center opened, he was not willing to move the team there permanently. In later years, he showed an increased willingness to spend. In 2003, Sterling signed Elton Brand to a six-year, $82 million deal, the biggest contract in franchise history. He matched the contract the Utah Jazz offered restricted free agent Corey Maggette: a deal worth $45 million over six years. The Clippers signed higher-priced veteran free agents, such as Cuttino Mobley in 2005, Tim Thomas in 2006, and Los Angeles native Baron Davis in 2008. In another first during the Sterling tenure of Clippers ownership, the team gave a four-year contract extension to head coach Mike Dunleavy, Sr., as well as a five-year extension to center Chris Kaman. Both extensions took effect starting in the 2007‚Äì08 NBA season. Under Sterling's ownership, only Dunleavy and Bill Fitch (1994‚Äì1998) lasted four seasons or more as Clippers head coach; as of the 2009‚Äì10 NBA season, Dunleavy entered his seventh season as Clippers head coach, by far the longest tenure in franchise history, but was relieved of his coaching duties on February 4, 2010. Dunleavy was also the club's general manager, but was fired from that position a month later. The Clippers accused Dunleavy of defrauding the team, and he sued the club for money owed on the remainder of his contract; an arbitrator ordered the Clippers to pay Dunleavy $13 million in 2011. The Clippers also went to court with former head coaches Fitch and Bob Weiss. Weiss, who signed a three-year contract but was fired in 1994 after one season, had to sue to receive money that was still owed him. In 2001, the Clippers sued the 63-year-old Fitch, whom the team had fired in 1998, after they stopping paying him for failing to seek employment to reduce the team's obligation for payment. The suit reached an undisclosed settlement before going to court. Sterling spent $50 million to build a state-of-the-art practice facility and team headquarters in Los Angeles' Playa Vista mixed-use development neighborhood. This followed the lead of several other NBA franchises, including the Lakers, Sacramento Kings, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Detroit Pistons, in having their own facility dedicated exclusively for team use. The facility was completed and opened in September 2008, in time for the start of the team's training camp. The team previously practiced at a local health club in suburban El Segundo, and before that at Los Angeles Southwest College. Sterling's ownership was viewed critically. ESPN The Magazine in 2009 named the Clippers the worst franchise in professional sports. Uncharacteristic for an owner, Sterling in 2010 heckled players on his own team‚Äîwith Baron Davis receiving the harshest treatment‚Äîwhile the owner sat courtside during home games. In late April 2014, following news of racial remarks, Sporting News described Sterling as \\"one of the worst owners in basketball for decades\\", while The New York Times and Forbes called him the \\"worst owner\\" in sports, and an analyst noted that under Sterling's ownership, from his purchasing the Clippers in 1981 through 2013-14, the Clippers achieved the worst winning percentage in all four major American sports leagues. =Racist remarks and lifetime ban= On April 25, 2014, TMZ Sports released a recording of a conversation between Sterling and his mistress, V. Stiviano (born Mar√≠a Vanessa Perez, also known as Monica Gallegos, Vanessa Perez, and Maria Valdez). In the recording from September 2013, a man confirmed to be Sterling was irritated over a photo Stiviano had posted on Instagram, in which she posed with Basketball Hall of Fame player Magic Johnson.Clippers Owner Donald Sterling Admits His Voice Is On Recording, Banned For Life By NBA , The Beverly Hills Courier, April 29, 2014.

You can bring them in, you can do whatever you want\\", but \\"the little I ask you is ... not to bring them to my games\\". The recording received national media coverage\\" Sterling's offensive behavior was no secret for years, 04.30.14 Franz Lidz - Sports Illustrated and Sterling retained Newport Beach-based attorney Bobby Samini as his lead counsel in litigation with the NBA, TMZ, and Stiviano. Clippers president Andy Roeser issued a statement the following day, indicating that Stiviano was being sued by the Sterling family and had \\"told Mr. Sterling that she would 'get even with him. A month earlier, Sterling's wife had sued Stiviano for the return of a $1.8 million Los Angeles duplex, a Ferrari, two Bentleys, a Range Rover, and $200,000 cash she said her husband bought for Stiviano. Sterling's comments affected the NBA, a league with predominantly black players. On April 26, the team held a meeting to discuss the incident. Both coaches and players expressed anger toward the comments, and they briefly raised the possibility of boycotting Game 4 of their series against the Golden State Warriors on April 27 before deciding against it. Instead, players protested Sterling's remarks by wearing their shirts inside-out in order \\"to obscure any team logo\\" during their pre-game huddle. On April 28, players of the Miami Heat wore their uniform tops inside-out to show solidarity with the Clippers. LeBron James commented on the situation, \\"There's no room for Donald Sterling in the NBA\\". The owner of the Miami Heat, Micky Arison, also called the allegations \\"appalling, offensive and very sad\\". NBA's Kevin Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Magic Johnson, Charles Barkley, Shaquille O'Neal, Kobe Bryant, and Michael Jordan also condemned Sterling's remarks.Michael Jordan 'outraged' over reported Donald Sterling comments The Los Angeles chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) cancelled its plans for the following month to award Sterling for a second time with its lifetime achievement award. President Barack Obama characterized the recording of Sterling as \\"incredibly offensive racist statements\\". Chumash Casino, the Clippers' most visible sponsor during the prior four seasons, ended its relationship with the team, as did sponsors CarMax, Virgin America, and others. On April 29, 2014, UCLA announced that it was rejecting a $3 million gift from Sterling. On April 29, NBA commissioner Adam Silver announced that Sterling had been banned from the league for life and fined $2.5 million, the maximum fine allowed by the NBA constitution. Silver stripped Sterling of virtually all of his authority over the Clippers, and banned him from entering any Clippers facility. He was also banned from attending any NBA games. The punishment was one of the most severe ever imposed on a professional sports team owner. Moreover, Silver stated that he would move to force Sterling to sell the team, based on a willful violation of the rules, which would require the consent of three-quarters, or 22, of the other 29 NBA team owners. In his first public comments in nearly two weeks after his ban from the NBA, Sterling appeared on CNN with Anderson Cooper on May 11 to apologize, saying he was \\"not a racist\\", and ask for forgiveness. He said he was \\"baited\\" by Stiviano into making the offensive comments. In the interview, Sterling criticized Magic Johnson's character and his battle with HIV. In response to Sterling, Silver apologized for the NBA to Johnson \\"that he continues to be dragged into this situation and be degraded by such a malicious and personal attack\\". Sterling's wife, Shelly, had co-owned the team with him since 1983, and she had served as one of the team's two alternate governors. While she was not included in the NBA's ban on Sterling, the league stated that \\"if a controlling owner's interest is terminated by a vote, all other team owners' interests are automatically terminated as well\\". In response to the NBA's decision, Sterling's attorney Bobby Samini called the NBA a \\"band of hypocrites,\\" citing previous discriminatory conduct by the NBA, and suggested the organization \\"take a close reflection at their own conduct.\\" The NBA formally charged Sterling with damaging the league with his comments from both the TMZ recording and the CNN interview, and scheduled a hearing to begin on June 3, after which the league could vote to terminate the Sterlings' ownership. On May 23, Shelly Sterling said her husband had authorized her to negotiate the sale of the team. On May 29, she reached a deal, pending NBA approval, to sell 100% of the Clippers to former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer for $2 billion. Shelly also agreed not to sue the NBA and to indemnify the league against other suits related to the case, including any initiated by her husband. The NBA responded by cancelling its hearing to consider stripping the Clippers from the Sterlings. Sterling disavowed having given his wife authorization to sell the team, denied all charges, and refused to sell the Clippers. He called the penalties \\"draconian\\" and referred to the process as a \\"sham\\". He then sued the NBA for $1 billion, alleging it had violated both antitrust laws and his constitutional rights. On June 4, 2014, attorney Maxwell Blecher announced that Sterling had decided to drop the lawsuit against the NBA, and had agreed to allow the proposed $2 billion sale of the Clippers to Ballmer. The sale would be approved pending a majority vote of league owners. On June 9, Blecher said Sterling had withdrawn support for the sale, and would resume the lawsuit. However, Shelly was granted a trial in probate court that began on July 7 to allow her to proceed with the sale as sole trustee; she contended that three doctors reported that Sterling was suffering from Alzheimer's disease and lacked the mental capacity to be a trustee. Closing arguments were scheduled for July 28. The NBA was scheduled to vote on the sale to Ballmer on July 15, the same day the deal was set to expire unless Ballmer granted an extension. On July 23, Sterling sued his wife, the NBA, and Silver for damages, alleging that they violated corporate law and defrauded him in order to sell the team to Ballmer. Sterling also sought an injunction to freeze the sale. On July 28, the probate court ruled in Shelly's favor, and granted her request for an order to permit the sale to be completed regardless of any intervention by an appellate court. Ballmer's $2 billion purchase of the team closed on August 12, and Shelly received the titles \\"Clippers Number One Fan\\" and \\"owner emeritus\\" as part of the sale agreement. , half of the $2 billion paid by Ballmer was held in an escrow account controlled by the NBA pending the conclusion of Sterling's lawsuit over the sale of the team. One of Sterling's critics among the team owners, Atlanta Hawks majority stockholder Bruce Levenson, also left the NBA in September 2014, as an indirect result of the incidents and lawsuits. Levenson reported a racially insensitive e-mail (sent two years prior) to the NBA, as the Sterling case made Levenson feel remorseful for behaving in a manner he described as similar. U.S. District Judge Fernando M. Olguin dismissed Sterling's 2014 lawsuit over the sale of the team in March 2016. The judge assailed it as \\"plainly insufficient\\" and \\"clearly implausible.\\" Sterling appealed the decision but the 82-year-old's attorneys didn't file an opening brief by the deadline. The matter concluded with a three-page motion to voluntarily dismiss the case. In 2017, a judge ruled that two law firms could move forward with their lawsuit to collect more than $270,000 in legal fees allegedly owed by Donald and Shelly Sterling, stemming from the 2014 probate action that cleared the way for the sale of the Clippers. Discrimination lawsuits In February 2003, the Housing Rights Center of Los Angeles (HRC) filed a housing discrimination case against Sterling on behalf of 18 tenants. The lawsuit featured several racist statements allegedly made by Sterling to employees, such as that \\"black people smell and attract vermin\\" and \\"Mexicans that just sit around and smoke and drink all day\\", as well as Sterling's alleged intent to rent only to Korean tenants because \\"they will pay the rent and live in whatever conditions I give them\\". Part of the HRC case's resolution included U.S. District Judge Dale Fischer awarding the plaintiffs' attorney $4.9 million in attorneys fees. While the final terms for the plaintiffs were confidential, the judge said the fees were justified as the settlement obtained by the plaintiffs against Sterling was one of the largest of its kind and the public benefit terms were significant and wide-ranging. In 2006, the U.S. Department of Justice sued Sterling for housing discrimination for using race as a factor in filling some of his apartment buildings. The suit charged that Sterling refused to rent to non-Koreans in the Koreatown neighborhood and to African Americans in Beverly Hills. In November 2009, ESPN reported that Sterling agreed to pay a fine of $2.7 million to settle the lawsuit. In February 2009, the Clippers were sued in L.A. Superior Court by former longtime Clippers executive Elgin Baylor for wrongful termination and employment discrimination on the basis of age and race.Lisa Dillman, Elgin Baylor sues Clippers, claiming racism, Los Angeles Times, February 12, 2009. Retrieved February 13, 2009.Lisa Dillman, Mention of David Stern is an error in Elgin Baylor's lawsuit, Los Angeles Times, February 14, 2009. Retrieved February 13, 2009.Bill Plaschke, There are no winners in Elgin Baylor's lawsuit against Clippers, Los Angeles Times, February 13, 2009. Retrieved February 13, 2009. The lawsuit alleged that co-defendant Sterling told Baylor that he wanted to fill his team with \\"poor black boys from the South and a white head coach\\". The suit also alleged that Mike Dunleavy, Sr., the head coach, \\"was given a four-year, $22-million contract...[as he was a] Caucasian\\" while Baylor's salary had \\"been frozen at a comparatively paltry $350,000 since 2003\\". Baylor later dropped the race accusation. The case went to trial in March 2011, with the jury ruling unanimously in favor of the Clippers and Sterling. Sexual harassment lawsuits In 1996, Christine Jasky, a property management consultant for Sterling who also did work for the Clippers, sued Sterling for sexual harassment, claiming she quit her job after he repeatedly offered her money for sex, and asked her to recruit sexual partners for him. Sterling countersued, and the two eventually reached a confidential settlement in 1998. Sumner Davenport, a property supervisor for Sterling who was fired in 2002, sued him in 2003 for sexual harassment for \\"unwanted and offensive physical conduct\\". She lost the case at a jury trial two years later. Court documents indicate that Davenport was a property supervisor based in Sterling's Beverly Hills office, with the responsibilities of overseeing several of his apartment buildings. In her case, she asserted she was fired for her complaints against and refusing to comply with his racially discriminating and abusive behavior against tenants, his illegal eviction process, as well as his offensive physical conduct against her. Court records indicate Sterling's organization denies firing her.Superior Court of the State of California for the County of Los Angeles, Case #BC299818 Personal life In 1955, Sterling married Rochelle (\\"Shelly\\") Stein, with whom he had three children: Scott, Chris, and Joanna. Joanna's husband, Eric Miller, served as the Clippers' director of basketball administration, voluntarily leaving after Sterling sold the team. Sterling had a relationship with a woman named Alexandra Castro. Seeking the return of a house she was living in, Sterling sued her in 2003 after their relationship ended. Castro, in 1999, had signed a contract that gave Sterling protection from her seeking palimony, which divides assets between unmarried couples. Their agreement read that Sterling \\"is happily married, has a family and has no intention of engaging in any activity inconsistent with his domestic relationship\\". In the proceedings, Castro stated that Sterling consulted her on Clippers personnel decisions. Sterling and Castro reached a confidential settlement out of court in 2004. Sterling and Shelly became estranged at the end of 2012, when he moved to a mansion in Beverly Hills, California, after she kicked him out of their beach house in Malibu, California, following a family dispute during which he was arguing with a mistress on the phone. A week later, Sterling's son Scott was found dead on New Year's Eve, having died of an accidental narcotic drug overdose at the age of 32.Blankstein, A. and Stevens, M., Death of Scott Sterling, Son of Clippers Owner, Ruled Accidental, Los Angeles Times, April 22, 2013. On August 5, 2015, Sterling's attorney Bobby Samini confirmed to KABC-TV that Sterling filed for divorce from his wife Shelly. In March 2016, Samini informed the Los Angeles Times that \\"notwithstanding all the difficult events of the last two years, the Sterlings have resolved their differences\\" and decided not to proceed with their divorce. =Health= In 2012, Sterling began treatment for prostate cancer. By May 2014, according to multiple doctors Sterling was in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease. He was deemed mentally unfit to continue to lead the financial affairs of the Sterling Family Trust, clearing the way for his wife Shelly to sell the Los Angeles Clippers on his behalf despite his protests.

A right-handed batsman, he played for India in 22 Test matches. Ashok Mankad was born in a Vadnagra Nagar Brahmin family as the eldest son of Vinoo Mankad, who represented India in 44 Test matches, in Bombay. His brothers Rahul Mankad and Atul Mankad were also first class cricketers. Mankad made a sequence of big scores in the Harris Shield as a teenager. After making 348, 325 and 258 in this inter-school tournament, he was picked to represent Bombay and West Zone cricket team in Under-19 tournaments. He represented the Bombay University in the Rohinton Baria Trophy in his first year in the college. He hit 62 against Nagpur University, 131 against Karnataka and 152 against Madras in the final. Mankad made his first class debut a week before his seventeenth birthday. Despite average performances in the domestic level in his first few years, he was selected to play Tests against New Zealand in 1969‚Äì70. The selection committee under Vijay Merchant tried out many new players that season and Chetan Chauhan and Ajit Pai also made their debut in the same match. After failing to reach thirty in any of the four innings against New Zealand, he was dropped from the team for the third Test. Without much of a reason, Mankad was again selected against Australia a month later. This time he scored 74, 8, 64, 68 and 97 in his first five innings. Mankad batted at No.3 in the first Test and added a record 146 for the fourth wicket with Nawab of Pataudi. But when Dilip Sardesai was dropped, he opened in the remaining three Tests. Mankad and Farokh Engineer added 111 and 43 at Bombay and 85 at Delhi. Though he played 15 more Tests in his career, Mankad scored only one more fifty and the 97 at Delhi was to remain his highest score. Mankad shared some good opening partnerships with Sunil Gavaskar in the series in West Indies in 1970‚Äì71 but after a bad tour of England in 1971, he was dropped. He gave up opening in domestic cricket and reverted to batting in the middle order. In the 1976‚Äì77 season in the Ranji Trophy, Mankad scored 827 runs at an average of 206. He hit 203* against Maharashtra and 208* against Haryana in successive innings. He went past the Bombay record of Ajit Wadekar for the highest aggregate in the tournament. These efforts found him a place for the Indian team for one last tour. In Australia in 1977‚Äì78, Mankad scored 508 runs at 50.80 in the tour matches, finished fourth in the season's averages and topped the averages for India. But three Test appearances brought him only 119 runs at 23.80, allowing Chetan Chauhan to establish himself as an opening partner of Gavaskar in this series. Mankad did not play another Test and ended his career with 991 runs. Mankad was a heavy scorer at the Ranji level. When he retired, he had a record aggregate of 6619 runs in Ranji matches at an average of 76, with his 22 centuries equalling Vijay Hazare's record. He captained Bombay to titles in 1974‚Äì75 and 1975‚Äì76. His highest first class score of 265 was made in the 1981 finals where Bombay defeated Delhi by an innings. He also played some league cricket in England. Mankad was married to Nirupama Mankad (n√©e Vasant), a former Asian Tennis champion. Their son Harsh Mankad is a member of the Indian Davis Cup tennis team since 2000. Elder son Mihir Mankad was also a tennis player. Mankad served as a commentator and a coach of the Mumbai Ranji team for a few years. He died in his sleep on 1 August 2008.

History The Chicago Academy of Sciences had previously been located at Lincoln Park's century old Matthew Laflin Memorial Building.\\"Chicago Academy of Sciences\\". Encyclopedia of Chicago. Retrieved 2006-01-08 The Academy was founded in 1857 by young prominent American naturalists, such as Robert Kennicott and William Stimpson. It was Chicago‚Äôs first museum dedicated to nature and science, and developed one of the finest natural history collections in the United States in the mid-19th century, but that collection was lost in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. The museum was rebuilt but lost its home again in the financial turmoil of the 1880s. The Academy then built a museum building in Lincoln Park in 1898, which became the model for the Chicago Park District's museum-in-the-parks program. The old museum attracted many visitors with its naturalistic dioramas of area ecological settings. After outgrowing the Laflin Building, a new home for the Academy was constructed nearby, on the southeastern banks of the North Pond. Its old building is currently used for Lincoln Park Zoo administration. Exhibits and programs The original series of long-term exhibitions and botanic recreations around the building ‚Äì including Butterfly Haven, City Science house, Water Lab and Wilderness Walk habitat exhibits ‚Äì were developed by a team of Academy staff, led by Paul G.

It opened on October 5, 2002. History Founder Daniel Gluck wanted to start a museum dedicated to \\"the history, evolution and cultural significance of human sexuality.\\"Museum of Sex official website The official mission of the Museum of Sex is \\"to preserve and present the history, evolution, and cultural significance of human sexuality. In its exhibitions, programs and publications, The Museum of Sex is committed to open discourse and exchange, and to bringing to the public the best in current scholarship.\\"Museum of Sex press kit The museum focuses on a variety of sexual preferences and subcultures, including lesbian and gay history and erotica, BDSM, pornography, and sex work. Although the museum's exhibits are presented in an educational format, they sometimes feature explicit content. Because of this, visitors must be 18 years old or older. While Gluck was planning the museum, the New York State Board of Regents rejected its application for non- profit status, objecting that the idea of a \\"museum of sex\\" made \\"a mockery\\" of the concept of museums.Kleinfield, N.R. \\"Sex Sells, but Can it Sell a Museum?\\" New York Times (May 30, 2002) Because of this, and because Gluck opted not to accept funding from the pornography industry, the admission fee was initially $17.\\"Museum Of Sex Draws The Curious On First Day\\" Newsday (October 14, 2006)) Unlike restrictions placed on adult entertainment venues, New York City authorities have allowed the museum to locate itself within 500 feet of a church or school. Before the Museum opened to the public, William Donohue of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights called it a \\"museum of smut,\\" writing \\"If the museum's officials were honest, they would include a death chamber that would acknowledge all the wretched diseases that promiscuity has caused. And they would give due recognition to the role that promiscuity has played in creating poverty. But instead we can look for the museum to celebrate public sex.\\".Catholic League press release However, since it opened in 2002, the Museum has faced no opposition from religious officials and even hosted an event entitled \\"Faith in Latex\\" which brought together leaders from the Catholic, Pentecostal, Episcopalian, Buddhist, and Jewish faiths. *Kaminer, Michael. \\"Of Religion and Rubbers\\" The Jewish Daily Forward (June 16, 2010) http://www.openjourney.com/article/sex-museums-around- world-10.html The inaugural exhibit, NYC Sex: How New York City Transformed Sex in America, focused on the museum's home city, but later exhibits focused on sexuality in other cultures and time periods. Other exhibitions have included Sex Among the Lotus: 2500 Years of Chinese Erotic Obsession; GET OFF: Exploring the Pleasure Principles; Vamps & Virgins: The Evolution of American Pinup Photography 1860-1960; Men Without Suits: Objectifying the American Male Body; and an online exhibition US Patent Office Sex Inventions.

In addition to her brief movie career, Cooper was also known for being the mistress of General Douglas MacArthur. Born in Manila, she was infamous for the first on-screen kiss in a Filipino movie, Ang Tatlong Hambog (1926). In 1930, she met US General Douglas MacArthur and became his mistress. He arranged for her to follow him to Washington, D.C. While serving as Army Chief of Staff in the 1930s, MacArthur filed a libel action against a journalist at The Washington Post, Drew Pearson. When Pearson added Cooper to his list of witnesses to be deposed, MacArthur dropped the suit. MacArthur subsequently paid Cooper $15,000 to leave Washington, the money allegedly delivered by his aide, Dwight Eisenhower. However, she did not return to the Philippines, and after a few failed attempts in Hollywood and a hair dressing shop in the Midwest, committed suicide in 1960. Personal life Elizabeth was born Isabel Rosario Cooper to a Scottish father Arthur Edmund Cooper and Rosario Lopez Chinese- Filipina mother, who was a haciendera (farm owner) from Vallehermoso, Negros Oriental. She was nicknamed \\"Dimples\\". As a teenager she traveled Southeast Asia as a torch singer / entertainer. Film career Isabel appeared in a few B-grade Filipino films starting in 1925, under the screen name \\"Chabing\\". Two of her films were Miracles of Love (1925) and Ang Tatlong Hambog (1926). In the latter film, Cooper made Philippine film history with Luis Tuason when they performed the very first kissing scene in a Philippine film. She was 12 years old at the time. She did not act in any Filipino films after 1930, although the 1941 Tagalog film Ikaw Pala is sometimes wrongly attributed to her. \\"Ikaw Pala\\" had another actress named Cresencia Aligada acting in it in a supporting role; Aligada also went by the screen name \\"Dimples,\\" hence the mistaken identity. After her 1934 break-up with MacArthur, Cooper attempted to find roles in Hollywood, but in vain. Relationship with General MacArthur In 1930, at the age of 16, Cooper met the American General Douglas MacArthur, then commander of all U.S. troops in the Philippines. MacArthur's marriage had ended a year earlier. Cooper became his mistress in Manila, a fact the 50-year-old MacArthur hid from his 80-year-old mother. In Manila, the teenaged Cooper lived in Paco. Five months after they first met, MacArthur returned to the United States; while he intended to bring her to Washington, he could not risk scandal by traveling with her, so he bought her a ticket on a ship to arrive after him. She arrived in Washington and ended up ensconced in an apartment in Georgetown, Washington, D.C. MacArthur later moved her to the Chastleton Hotel (now a co-op building). According to one biographer of MacArthur, William Manchester, MacArthur \\"showered [Cooper] with presents and bought her many lacy tea gowns, but no raincoat. She didn't need one, he told her; her duty lay in bed.\\" In 1933, when the secret affair threatened to become public, MacArthur brought it to an end, reportedly giving her $15,000 and a ticket back to the Philippines. She did not use the ticket and never returned to the Philippines. In 1934, the 20-year-old Cooper moved to the Midwestern United States, where she owned a hairdressing salon, before moving to Los Angeles several years later. Cooper tried to find work as an actress in Hollywood; however, the only roles that she could manage were those as an extra, such as a geisha and a Filipina nurse in films. In 1946 she was one of Rex Harrison's concubines in Anna and the King. In Unconquered (1947 film) she was an unidentified and uncredited Native American.. Retrieved November 25, 2015.

Visits to the Lachen monastery and the women's handicraft centre to view weaving of traditional blankets and carpets will provide insights into the local way of life or perhaps a stunning mountain drive can be taken along the Tibetan plateau to Gurudongmar and Cho Lhamu as a day tour from Lachen. The sacred Gurudongmar lake at a height of 17,100 ft encircled by snowy massifs is something one would not dare to miss on a visit to Sikkim. One can also stay over night at Thangu which is 30 km away from Lachen. During summer and monsoon the entire place is dotted with flowers of all kinds. The relatively unexplored and untouched Chopta Valley is located in north of Lachen. Rich with alpine vegetation and rhododendrons, enthralling lakes and rivers add to the beauty of Chopta Valley. A preferred destination with nature lovers, Chopta is also famous for the several monuments of historical and religious importance. Wildlife enthusiasts can spot rare species of animals, plants and birds in the Chopta Valley. Bird watching is a popular activity and the region is ideal for trekking and other adventure sports.  Geography  Just about 129 km from Gangtok, Lachen is located at an altitude of 8838 ft. Seasons unfold timelessly in this high altitude habitat: gaily painted with myriad flowers in the spring and monsoon, bathed in spectacular weather in autumn and snow clad fairy-tale winters.  Transport  Lachen is about from the capital Gangtok, and can be reached via a six-hour road journey. A short two-day-long trekking route also connects the Yumthang Valley to Lachen. It has a population of around 1,000. Lachen has its own system of rules and regulations known as Dzumsa. The heads of the Dzumsa are known as Pipon and Gyenbos. To the north there is the old town of Thangu where the daytime temperature varies from 4 to 12 degrees Celsius (40 to 55 ¬∞F), even in the months of June and July. Gurudongmar Lake can be reached from Lachen, a sacred lake in the Great Himalayas Region. Lachen is connected with numerous routes in India. The most convenient ways to travel Lachen are by Air, Rail and Road.

Background The 3,000 sq-metre centre Snow City was built at a cost of S$6 million and was officially opened on 3 June 2000. It was a joint venture by the Science Centre, Singapore and NTUC Income Co-operative Pte Ltd. The idea behind the collaboration was that Singapore being a tropical country, many Singaporeans have never had the opportunity to experience the cold climates and snow. With the set up of Snow City will give everybody a chance to learn more about snow, in a fun way. Highlights Visitors will first arrive at the Air Lock, which is maintained at 10¬∞C. This allows visitors to become comfortable with the lower temperatures before they enter the chamber itself. The major focus of Snow City is its Snow Chamber, a 1200 sq-metre room covered with snow. The Snow Chamber is well maintained at -5¬∞C and snow level is kept constantly at 40CM in depth. Between 10 and 15 tons of snow is created each week in order to maintain this level. The snow is produced using a special Snow Gun, which cools water using liquid nitrogen. Inside the Snow Chamber, is a 60 meter long high slope which is about 3 storeys high. 'Snowtubing' is the main activity, where visitors will be sliding down the snow slope while sitting on an inflatable tube. There is also a Snow-Play Area for the younger children. There is a place for wine and dine on level 2, named Alphine Lodge. Snow City's sound educational programmes and workshops are available to schools and interested groups. Technology A specially designed Snow Gun is used in the production of snow on site. Firstly, water is atomized using high-pressure compressed air. The water then arrives at the snow gun and is pushed out of the special nozzles at the end of the barrel. Liquid nitrogen at a temperature of approx. -196¬∞C is also passed through the snow gun at the same time. The extreme cold of the liquid nitrogen instantly freezes the atomized water into snowflake-like crystallites. The simplified formula to produce snow is *One ton of liquid nitrogen + one ton of water = one ton of \\"snow\\".

She grew up near Warman, Saskatchewan. She has a BA and MA in Philosophy from the University of Saskatchewan and a Ph.D in Philosophy from the University of Calgary. Wiebe first became widely known as the Women's President from 1988‚Äì1994 and the President and CEO from 1995-1998 of the National Farmers Union. During her term she vocally defended the role of the Canadian Wheat Board in the marketing of prairie grains. In 2001, Wiebe sought the leadership of the Saskatchewan New Democratic Party (and by implication, the office of Premier of Saskatchewan, as the party was in government at the time), following the retirement of then premier and party leader Roy Romanow. For the first time in Saskatchewan, the NDP utilized One Member One Vote as its means of selecting a leader rather than a delegated leadership convention. Wiebe ran on the most explicitly left-wing platform of the major contenders, and placed third behind Chris Axworthy and the eventual winner, Lorne Calvert. Wiebe chose not to run for a seat in the Legislative Assembly of Saskatchewan in the subsequent 2003 provincial election. However, she did run, unsuccessfully, as the federal New Democratic Party candidate in the 2004 federal election in the riding of Saskatoon‚ÄîHumboldt, against Conservative candidate Brad Trost, Liberal candidate Patrick Wolfe, and incumbent independent Jim Pankiw. In what was the closest four-way race in the country, Wiebe placed second, with only 417 fewer votes than the winner, Brad Trost, and only 18 more votes than Wolfe (the third place candidate). In the 2006 Canadian federal election, Wiebe ran as the NDP candidate in the riding of Saskatoon‚ÄîRosetown‚ÄîBiggar, but lost to incumbent Conservative Carol Skelton. Wiebe is currently a professor of church and society at St. Andrew's College in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. She was once again the NDP candidate in Saskatoon‚ÄîRosetown‚ÄîBiggar in the 2008 federal election, but Conservative candidate Kelly Block defeated her by just 262 votes (0.98%), Wiebe's narrowest loss to date.

The word was originally used by teenagers and young adults alike. Nowadays, its use has spread to all age groups. The term fresa may be considered synonymous with the term preppy, which originated in the United States in the 1960s to define teenagers with a conservative mentality who did not drink and proudly displayed their social status. In Mexico, during the 1970s, the meaning changed and became a term to describe the lifestyles of the youth who were wealthy and well-known. However, the current usage of the term in Mexico has its origins in the late 1980s. During the rapid change in society as a result of globalization, which brought new forms of fashion, food and entertainment into the culture, a number of Mexican people began to adopt the \\"preppy\\" American lifestyle by mimicking American styles of dress, mannerisms and etiquette. Some examples include wearing polo shirts, boat shoes and chinos. The colloquialisms used by fresas are often referred to as \\"fresa talk\\". Sociolinguistic use Ever since it has come into use, the term has referred to the specific lifestyles, behaviors, habits, and other characteristics that have no specific relation to economic status or ethnicity, but that somehow became factors of the phenomenon when these lifestyles and habits required certain aspects that only can be found in an upper class circle. Although, it is not critically necessary because belonging to a fresa group pertains to the way one thinks and acts. People that call themselves \\"fresas\\", are usually not part of it, but rather a false attempt to belong in that group. That is to say, 'authentic' fresas do not exist, although some people naturally think, behave, and act the stereotype without noticing it, and they find it completely normal. The term has been made popular in other Latin American countries due to international popularity of TV shows with fresa characters. In Venezuela there is another word for the same people, which is \\"cotufa\\", which literally means popcorn. Supposedly, the reason for this term is due to the comparison of \\"one's brain to a piece of popcorn\\", but this term has its differences from the word \\"fresa\\". The term \\"cotufa\\" is actually more like the \\"dumb blonde\\" trope, but in Venezuela hair color is not a deciding factor as people with other hair colors may also have similar traits. A closer term would be the word \\"sifrina\\", because it is directly related to rich, spoiled girls. Fresa is sometimes considered the stereotypical opposite of naco, however it is not always a derogatory word. Traditionally, teens who attend expensive schools or have wealthy parents (and are more likely to be fresas) are called \\"ni√±os bien\\" (fine children) or \\"gente bien\\" (fine people). The fresa accent is also different from the typical slow-spoken Mexican accent of some regions, with a higher established accent and different tone. While originally, most of the educated high class regarded as fresas had a proper vocabulary in concordance with their education, upbringing and status, nowadays fresas have a way of speech that is considered frivolous and many times uneducated by the intellectual elite (composed of people from all social classes). The fresa clothing mostly consists of top, mainstream brands such as: Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister Co., Lacoste, Armani as well as other expensive clothing brands, and can usually be seen shopping in well located shopping centers (malls) and always paying with cards instead of cash. Things go back to the late 70s and 80s when (for the first time in Mexican society) kids, teenagers and even young adults started using stereotypically \\"fresa\\" behavior as a way of giving a false impression (deceiving) of their real social, economical (& educational) status. Since then, such tendency prevailed as a mainstream among the Mexicans until recent (and rather counter) new subcultures have risen and replace it, such as \\"Emos\\", \\"Goths\\", \\"Darks\\", \\"Punketos\\", \\"Tech-savvy teens\\", \\"Metrosexuals\\", \\"Barrio\\", \\"Chuntaros\\", \\"Bronies\\", \\"Rancholos\\", \\"Cosplayers\\", etc. (although there are many still stuck in the \\"Fresa\\" style). Back in those days, it was a \\"privilege\\" to be mistaken as a \\"Fresa\\". The copycats rapidly spread all over the country, and knock-offs replaced the quality of the original brands for cheap ones that deceived passing out as \\"originals\\". The brands of choice of the \\"Fresas\\" were Dolce & Gabbana, Zara, Polo Ralph Lauren, Furor, Abercrombie & Fitch, Reebok, Lacoste, Tommy Hilfiger, Ray-Ban Wayfarer, Banana Republic, Hugo Boss, Guess, Levi's, Puma, Armani, Calvin Klein, American Eagle, among others. The bands and artists of choice, whose influence bred and helped expand the phenomenon were \\"Timbiriche\\", \\"Flans\\", \\"Man√°\\", \\"Luis Miguel\\", \\"Sasha\\", \\"Pandora\\", \\"Mecano\\", \\"RBD\\", \\"Kudai\\" etc. The places of choice were \\"The News Pedregal\\", \\"The Magic Circus\\", \\"Plaza Satelite\\", \\"Perisur\\", Santa Fe, \\"Plaza Inn\\", \\"Chazz\\", \\"El Ajusco\\", among others. Besides, as a part of every subculture, a \\"characteristic\\" dance was born: the \\"wavy\\", in which one would remain standing, sort of bouncing from left to right and all the way round while miming a \\"wavy\\" move with the opposite arm (lifted about the shoulder's level pararell to the floor). The magazine \\"Eres\\" was one of the most popular and influential among adolescents, and the radio station \\"WFM 96.9\\" was certainly locally important and popular. Fresa as a subculture Fresas have become something of a subculture in contemporary Mexico; like metalheads and punks, they dress in a certain way, speak in a certain way and live in a certain way. They are an abundant and very influential subculture with little or no knowledge of what happens outside their circles. But since the mid-1990s the hip hop and reggaeton scenes have been taking over Mexico and other Latin American countries. Fresas are mostly stereotyped as frivolous, self-centered and pretty much unintelligent; mostly as zombies who swirl through life solely thinking about superficial matters. However and in some cases notwithstanding, some are actually part of the social, economic, and intellectual elite of the country. For example, this particular group has more people per capita who speak a second language, usually English. Some of the people who fall into this category also come from families with both political and corporate influence. Nevertheless, the most clear indicator of the synthetic origin of the fresa subculture and speech/accent is perhaps the fact that although longstanding members of the high class and middle class elites, the fathers and/or grandfathers of the fresa have either standard or educated regional accents and more traditional attitudes, cultural viewpoints and dressing codes. The word fresa is somewhat pejorative outside the fresa circles. Being called a fresa, for example, in a punk subculture could be considered an insult, as many of the people in other subcultures absolutely abhor fresas, and use the term as an insult. The term fresa however, is scarcely used outside the self- proclaimed fresa circles (basically composed by people from the high and middle classes), as many people who are actually part of some social, economical or intellectual elite don't view themselves as fresas and simply see the word as a term to describe their lifestyle; they view themselves simply as \\"normal\\" people and refuse to label themselves as something, even though people outside could see them as such. Rarely, if ever, will you hear people from these elites not inside fresa circles call themselves or another one a fresa. They will on occasion refer as a fresa to one another as a form of satire. Fictional fresas * A well-known \\"fresa\\" is the fictional persona El Pirrurris, created by comedian Luis de Alba, a parody of the so- called juniors, the young and presumptuous children of Mexican politicians and entrepreneurs. Although this character is overacted and doesn't exactly match the real life fresa standards, he is often mentioned as a reference. * Jose Emilio Pacheco, in his novel \\"Las Batallas en el Desierto\\" written in 1981, exposes a series of characters that accurately represent diverse social Mexican subcultures from which we can have a more precise understanding of some social aspects in real-life interaction to comprehend how really several groups are. * In the Mexican telenovela So√±adoras Ang√©lica Vale plays Julieta, a teenager of lower middle class origins who often poses as a high society person by behaving like a fresa. * In the Mexican film Amar te duele the character Renata and her group of friends would be considered fresas. *In the Mexican telenovela \\"Amor en Custodia\\" the character B√°bara. *In the Mexican telenovela \\"Teresa\\" the characters Paulo and A√≠da. *In the Mexican telenovela \\"Rebelde\\" the character M√≠a Colucci, and also Sol de la Riva. *In the Mexican telenovela \\"Una familia con suerte\\" the characters Freddy and Monica are considered fresas. *In the Mexican telenovela \\"Amores verdaderos\\" the character Nicole \\"Nikki\\" Brizz *The Mexican family television sitcom \\"Una familia de Diez\\" the character Martina is considered fresa by the viewers; her own family considered the same, especially by her cousin \\"La Nena\\", who always uses \\"fresa\\" as an insult because they aren't rich and she is only posing.

(BayanTel) is a telecommunications company serving areas in Metro Manila, Bicol and local exchange service areas in the Visayas and Mindanao regions combined, cover a population of over 25 million, nearly 33% of the population of the Philippines. BayanTel now operates as a subsidiary of Globe Telecom. BayanTel is also a provider of data and communications services such as dedicated domestic and international leased lines, frame relay services, Internet access, and other managed data services like Digital Subscriber Lines (DSL). BayanTel logo used from 1986 to 2008 History BayanTel was the operating arm of BTHC and formerly known as International Communications Corporation (ICC). It was incorporated on April 18, 1961 and is based in the United States. BayanTel is duly enfranchised to provide the following major telecommunications services: * Local Exchange Carrier (LEC) service * International Gateway Facility (IGF) service; * Leased Line service, domestic and international * Public Trunk Radio service * Public Calling Office service BayanTel's existing nationwide network is composed of satellite, terrestrial and land/submarine based cable facilities. The network includes capacities in the National Digital Transmission Network (NDTN), a joint project of six Philippine telecommunications carriers. BayanTel has 83% capacity interest in the NDTN project. The NDTN is the only major alternative telecommunications backbone in the Philippines, the other being operated by PLDT. The network also includes RCPI's existing Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) microwave network with spur links that also extends from Luzon to Mindanao. Both BayanTel and RCPI's networks are linked together to form a seamless and redundant system. and they have also fiber optic. Ownership, structure and affiliates BTHC is 85.4 owned by the Lopez Group of Companies, a publicly listed holding company owning the Lopez Group‚Äôs investments in communications, power, infrastructure and real estate, among others. Other main shareholders of the company is the AIF. AIF is advised by AIFML which oversees approximately US$1 billion in private equity funds focused on Asia with 46% investment in telecoms. Major investors of AIF include Frank Russell Company of the United States, the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. The principal companies under BTHC are BTI (98% owned) and Marifil Holdings Corporation (100% owned) which in turn owns 47% of Extelcom and Nagatel (91.5% owned). Extelcom, through the granting of a PA in 1988 and a CPCN in 1993, operates as an analogue cellular service provider in Metro Manila and selected urban centers in the provinces, from northern Luzon to as far south as Visayas and Mindanao. BTHC purchased its initial interest in Extelcom for approximately US$140.0 million in 1996. It then infused PhP765.5 million as part of a capital-raising exercise undertaken by Extelcom in 1997. No further investments or advances have been made by BTHC since. On June 30, 1999, BTHC decided to write-off its investment in Extelcom in recognition of its share in losses incurred by the latter. =Takeover by Globe Telecom= Globe Telecom, the country's largest telecommunications company, successfully acquired BayanTel through a debt purchase deal. Through Globe's acquisition of 96.17% of the company's debt, Globe is expected to become its largest investor and shareholder through conversion of its debt to equity. Following Globe Telecom‚Äôs tender offer for Bayan's debt in 2012, Globe Telecom held 96.5% of the total debt of Bayan at the end of that year. As proposed, restructuring would decrease the outstanding principal debt of Bayan from US$423.3 million to US$131.3 million, through the conversion of up to 69% of Bayan debt into Bayan shares. By converting some of Bayan debt to Bayan equity, Globe now owns 38% of Bayan as of end-2013. A change in control of Bayan requires certain regulatory approvals. The controlling interest of Lopez Holdings over Bayan through BTHC went down from 86% as of end-2012 to 59% as of end-2013.

As an actor, he also used the screen name Juan Urbano during the 1930s aside from his more popular screen name. Early Career His first film was Mahiwagang Biyolin in 1935. He made almost three dozen films under LVN Pictures as a contract star. Later Career He later put up his own movie company, Manuel Conde Pictures, in 1947 which produced classic films, notably the Juan Tamad series (Si Juan Tamad (1947), Si Juan Daldal (Anak ni Juan Tamad) (1948), Juan Tamad Goes to Congress (1959), Juan Tamad Goes to Society (1960), and Si Juan Tamad At Juan Masipag sa Pulitikang Walang Hanggan (1963)). Other movies Conde produced, directed and/or starred were Vende Cristo (1948), Prinsipe Paris (1949), Krus Na Kawayan (1956), Siete Infantes de Lara (1950) and its re-make in 1973, Molave (1961) and the internationally acclaimed Genghis Khan (1950). Genghis Khan was the first Filipino film to be acclaimed at an international film festival in Venice in 1952. His Juan Tamad Goes to Congress is considered the best Filipino satire ever filmed. Some films intended for international release were planned by Conde but these were not pushed through because of some financial and production problems such as Saranggani, a film about the Ifugao rice terraces, a collaboration between James Agee as scriptwriter and Conde as the actor-director with United Artists as the distributor, the Rickshaw Boy and The Brown Rajah. Death Manuel Conde died in 1985 in Manila, Philippines. Legacy He was honored posthumously in 2006 the Presidential Medal of Merit (for Films) by President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo for his contribution to culture and the arts. He was one of the recipients of that award together with visual artists Federico Alcuas, Oscar Zalameda and Mauro Malang Santos. From the words of Cecile Guidote Alvarez, Executive Director of the National Commission on Culture and the Arts, ‚ÄúThis is the President‚Äôs gesture of giving rightful honor to various artists who showcased Filipino excellence in the arts and cultural traditions in the international scene, underscoring the wealth of talent and heritage in our country‚Äù. In 2007, he was awarded posthumously the Lamberto Avellana Memorial Award by the Film Academy of the Philippines. Conde‚Äôs eldest son, Jun Urbano (a.k.a. Manuel Conde, Jr.), became himself a film director, actor, producer and writer. He is better known as Mr. Shooli in a television comedy series Mongolian Barbecue. On December 26, 2007, the Film Academy of the Philippines (FAP) announced the winners of the 25th anniversary presentation of the Luna Award before the actual awards night at the Club Filipino, San Juan City on December 27. The Lamberto Avellana Memorial Award will be awarded posthumously to Manuel Conde and Vic Silayan.Kasal, Kasali, Kasalo bags six of 12 Luna Awards.

The shoulder rest is an accessory that can be found on violins and violas. The shoulder rest appeared around the middle part of the 20th century. It may be made of wood, aluminium, carbon fiber or plastic. Usually, the shoulder rest attaches to the edge of the back of the violin with \\"feet\\" padded with rubber tubing or made of soft plastic. The goal of a shoulder rest is to allow a more comfortable attitude while playing by adding height to the shoulder and preventing the instrument from slipping. A shoulder rest generally follows the curve of the shoulder; some shoulder rests are bendable, others are made of sponge-like material, and a few have an extension that hooks further over the shoulder for stability. It is a relatively recent invention, and though it is quite commonly used among modern violinists and violists, it is not universally used. Depending on body type and style of clothes, some musicians prefer no more than a thin sponge, a cloth or sometimes nothing at all under the instrument. Function A shoulder rest, whatever its design, is an accessory to facilitate holding the violin. This can lighten the task of the left hand, enabling smoother and lighter shifting technique. All rests must make a compromise between violin support and freedom (or flexibility in holding the violin). There are a number of soft rests (generally anatomy friendly) and harder or rigid rests on the market. The shoulder rest is an invention of the middle part of the 20th century. Prior to its invention, violinists and violists employed a number of strategies to hold their instruments: the violin in particular was often depicted in the 16th and 17th centuries being held on or below the collarbone, though this does restrict shifting somewhat. Leopold Mozart is portrayed holding his violin quite low on his shoulder. Large violas were typically played with the aid of straps around the neck, and violins could be attached to the players' cravat. There are two common approaches to playing without a shoulder rest. The first is to hold the violin horizontal with the support of the left hand at all times. This usually decreases the mobility of the thumb during downshifts and requires the thumb never to leave the neck of the violin in order to support the instrument. The second approach is to support the instrument almost fully at the neck-shoulder region, often requiring the use of some form of padding beside the collar bone to bring the violin closer to the jaw and to hold the instrument in place. Some violinists may even raise their shoulder to achieve this, particularly when shifting positions and when using vibrato. Problems frequently surface while doing this, such as constant muscle tension which obstructs fluidity of technique, and may lead to injury in the long term. These problems can also arise from incorrect usage of shoulder rests. Some instruments have been marked due to the friction on the wood and added tension to the instrument the shoulder rest may bring according to each different player strength.

It is considered sacred by Buddhists, Sikhs and Hindus. The lake is named after Guru Padmasambhava‚Äîalso known as Guru Rinpoche‚Äîfounder of Tibetan Buddhism, who visited in the 8th century. Geography The high altitude lake is located away from Gangtok, the capital city of Sikkim, and about south of the Tibetan (Chinese) border, in the district of North Sikkim. The lake can be reached by road from Lachen via Thangu. The road from Thangu to Gurudongmar passes through rugged terrain with moraine, which has high alpine pastures covered with many rhododendron trees. While Indian tourists are allowed to visit the lake, foreigners need to get a special permit from the Ministry of Home Affairs in Delhi. Features Gurudongmar Lake Panorama view of frozen Gurudongmar Lake in May 2015 The lake, fed by glaciers, is located to the north of the Kangchengyao range, in a high plateau area connected with the Tibetan Plateau. It provides one of the source streams which joins the Tso Lahmu and then form the source of the Teesta River. The lake remains completely frozen in the winter months, from November to Mid-May. The lake has an area of and its peripheral length is . However, the size of the lake appears small at the place where the devotees offer worship because the larger part of the lake is not visible due to hilly topography obstructing the view. The area surrounding the lake, also known as Gurudongmar, is inhabited by Yaks, blue sheep and other wildlife of high altitude. The lake is fresh water and used to be very clear; the bed of the lake could even be seen from the middle of the lake. Pollution has muddied the waters in recent years, and the lake has taken on a white tinge and has obscured visibility. In Folklore A legend related to the frozen condition of the lake is linked to the visit of Guru Padmasambhava to the lake, on his way back from Tibet. When he saw it, he felt that it was worthy of veneration, as it represented the divine location of Dorje Nyima or Chhoedten Nyima. Because the lake remained frozen most of the year with no possibility of providing for drinking water needs, the people of the area appealed to Padmasambhva to help them. The guru agreed to help and placed his hands on a small part of the lake area, which stopped freezing during winter, facilitating drinking water to the people. Since then, the lake has been considered sacred and devotees carry this sacred water in containers. According to another legend, when Padmasambhava visited the lake he saw an auspicious phenomenon and then he considered it a good augury to enter the mainland of Sikkim, then known as Demojong. Some stories say that in the 15th century, Sikh Guru Nanak Dev Ji passed through the lake while on his return from Tibet, he was asked by the local people of Gurudongmar Village to help make the frozen lake a source of drinking water during the winter period, he touched part of the lake with his walking stick, making the lake free of snow throughout the year. The stories also say that he blessed the lake, announcing to the villagers that \\"whoever takes the water of this lake will gain virility and strength\\". According to this story, disputed by the Namgyal Institute of Tibetology, the lake and the surrounding hills derive their name from Guru Nanak's visit. Dispute A dispute arose when on the bank of the lake an Indian Army regiment of Sikhs‚Äîlocated at the border with China‚Äîconsidering the lake as the place visited by their saint Guru Nanak, constructed a Gurudwara in 1997‚Äì1998. This created anger among the Sikkimese people of the area, who considered the Gurudwara an illegal construction, because their ancient sacred lake had been sanctified by the visit of their Guru Padmasambhava. The government of Sikkim then constituted a high level committee to examine the issue and submit a report. Documents furnished to the committee by the Namgyal Institute of Tibetology, Gangtok, agreed with the claim of the local people that it was without a doubt a Buddhist religious place. This was accepted by the committee. The building constructed by the Sikh regiment was then handed over by the Army to the Lachen Monastery on 6 July 2001, in the presence of the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Chungthang, North Sikkim. The monastery placed a lama as a watchman at the lake, entrusted with the task of maintaining it.

The intermediate pantetheine is broken down into cysteamine and pantothenic acid. It is the biosynthetic precursor to the neurotransmitter hypotaurine. It is a stable aminothiol, i.e., an organic compound containing both an amine and a thiol functional groups. Cysteamine is a white, water-soluble solid. It is often used as salts of the ammonium derivative [HSCH2CH2NH3]+ including the hydrochloride, phosphocysteamine, and bitartrate. As a medication, cysteamine, sold under the brand name Cystagon among others, is indicated to treat cystinosis. Medical uses Cysteamine is used to treat cystinosis. It is available by mouth (capsule and extended release capsule) and in eye drops.  Adverse effects =Topical use = The most important adverse effect related to topical use might be skin irritation. =Oral use= The label for oral formulations of cysteamine carry warnings about symptoms similar to Ehlers- Danlos syndrome, severe skin rashes, ulcers or bleeding in the stomach and intestines, central nervous symptoms including seizures, lethargy, somnolence, depression, and encephalopathy, low white blood cell levels, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension that can cause headache, tinnitus, dizziness, nausea, double or blurry vision, loss of vision, and pain behind the eye or pain with eye movement. The main side effects are Ehlers- Danlos syndrome, severe skin rashes, ulcers or bleeding in the stomach and intestines, central nervous symptoms, low white blood cell levels, elevated alkaline phosphatase, and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). IIH can cause headache, ringing in the ears, dizziness, nausea, blurry vision, loss of vision, and pain behind the eye or with eye movement. Additional adverse effects of oral cysteamine include bad breath, skin odor, vomiting, nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea, and loss of appetite. The drug is in pregnancy category C; the risks of cysteamine to a fetus are not known but it harms babies in animal models at doses less than those given to people. For eye drops, the most common adverse effects are sensitivity to light, redness, and eye pain, headache, and visual field defects.  Interactions  There are no drug interactions for normal capsules or eye drops, but the extended release capsules should not be taken with drugs that affect stomach acid like proton pump inhibitors or with alcohol, as they can cause the drug to be released too quickly. It doesn't inhibit any cytochrome P450 enzymes. Pharmacology People with cystinosis lack a functioning transporter (cystinosin) which transports cystine from the lysosome to the cytosol. This ultimately leads to buildup of cystine in lysosomes, where it crystallizes and damages cells. Cysteamine enters lysosomes and converts cystine into cysteine and cysteine- cysteamine mixed disulfide, both of which can exit the lysosome. =Biological function= Cysteamine also promotes the transport of L-cysteine into cells, that can be further used to synthesize glutathione, which is one of the most potent intracellular antioxidants. Cysteamine is used as a drug for the treatment of cystinosis; it removes cystine that builds up in cells of people with the disease. History First evidence regarding the therapeutic effect of cysteamine on cystinosis dates back to 1950s. Cysteamine was first approved as a drug for cystinosis in the US in 1994. An extended release form was approved in 2013. Society and culture It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA). In 2013, the regular capsule of cysteamine cost about $8,000 per year; the extended release form that was introduced that year was priced at $250,000 per year. Research It was studied in in vitro and animal models for radiation protection in the 1950s, and in similar models from the 1970s onwards for sickle cell anemia, effects on growth, its ability to modulate the immune system, and as a possible inhibitor of HIV. In the 1970s it was tested in clinical trials for Paracetamol toxicity which it failed, and in clinical trials for systemic lupus erythematosus in the 1990s and early 2000s, which it also failed.

Current issues express legally the political, economic and social institutions in Mexico, while the history of those same institutions can be read in older issues. The Official Journal is similar to other main governmental journals (as the United States Federal Register or the Canada Gazette), but they differ from each other because they respond primarily to their type of government and secondly to their legal system. In the Official Journal, the main rules and regulations of the three branches of the federal government are published. This journal is the head of the set of the governmental journals in Mexico (every state and the Federal District has an official gazette for its jurisdiction, and also some municipalities). The importance of reading the Official Journal on a daily basis responds to the mandate that all official government rules and regulations must be published in it, and so only through this publication their compliance can become mandatory. Once a law or regulation is published, ignorance of it is no longer a legal defence. The Official Journal contains treaties, laws, decrees, sentences, agreements, resolutions, general and judicial warnings, national and international public bids to provide the government with goods and services, among other issues concerning the three Branches of the Federation.

Life Franc√©s was born in Valencia on October 25, 1982, though she spent part of her childhood in Galicia. Later on, she returned to her hometown to earn her degree from the San Carlos School of Fine Arts, at the Polytechnic University of Valencia. The first volume of the Favole trilogy (Norma Editorial, 2004) was her first illustrated work to be published. Manifested throughout the entirety of the Favole trilogy (2004‚Äì07) are themes emerging from Dark Romanticism, highly influenced by both the Pre- Raphaelite Brotherhood and well-known works of Gothic art. Her work received a number of awards and achieved great success in countries where it was published. Consequently, the American publishing house Dark Horse became interested in her work, and Franc√©s has since then been published in North America, thus allowing her to increase her fan base. She made herself known at the XXII Barcelona Comic Convention, where she made her first public appearance and earned the respect of renowned authors. Calendars featuring her artwork, as well as other promotional merchandise such as posters, puzzles, tarot cards and stationery products have been made available to the public for purchase. Despite the current effervescent nature of the Gothic movement, Franc√©s decided to experiment with different themes, and in 2007 the course of her artistic career took another direction with the publication of Arlene‚Äôs Heart (El Coraz√≥n de Arlene) by Planeta DeAgostini. Within the pages of this book, the author mixes dreams with social reality. In 2009, she reveals yet another change in her artistic register with the publication of the first volume in her Misty Circus series (Norma Editorial), an original collection of books based on the decadent world of the travelling circus, written especially for a younger audience. Near the end of that same year, Dark Sanctuary was also published (Astiberri Ediciones), written in collaboration with Dark Sanctuary, a ‚ÄúDark Atmospheric‚Äù band from France. The project, a fusion between music and illustration, aimed to reflect the poignant beauty of the shadows. The second volume in the Misty Circus series is entitled The Night of the Witches (La Noche de las Brujas), published by Norma Editorial in 2010. The continuation of the story takes place on the night of Samhain, an ancestral celebration in the pagan culture. In 2011, the Favole trilogy was re-edited in order to create one single volume entitled Integral Favole (Norma Editorial), a compilation of the three books in addition to unpublished sketches and illustrations specially included in this edition. A year later, in 2012, Ocean Lament (El Lamento del Oc√©ano) was published, in which the author features a listless, spectral mermaid as the main protagonist. While working on her upcoming books, Franc√©s was also busy creating individual licensed images for her merchandise, undertaking commissioned work and collaborating with other artists through various illustrations. One of the most noteworthy of these collaborative projects was the illustration ‚ÄúHekate‚Äù which was specially made for the album entitled ‚ÄúLuna‚Äù for the German Pagan Folk band, Faun, and the full artwork for a new cd project entitled \\"Naked Harp\\" of the Pagan Folk band, Omnia. At the end of 2014, Franc√©s presented her new project called MandrakMoors, in collaboration with the South Korean bjd doll company, Fairyland. For this project, the author set out to combine both the work of new character design, specifically of characters related to the world of witchcraft and pagan traditions, with the subsequent creation of bjd dolls, in partnership with FairyLand. Franc√©s is currently completing her first piece for MandrakMoors. The protagonist is Sionna F√≥mhar, the first character and bjd doll in the MandrakMoors universe. This work was scheduled to be released at the end of 2015.  Style  Franc√©s and her popular style are inspired by the Gothic movement, and her work is considered a model to follow in terms of illustration within this genre: ghostly women wearing long dresses with vampirical attributes. Her illustrations tend to depict solitary characters, young women or couples in a romantic or melancholic atmosphere. She is influenced by a number of writers including Edgar Allan Poe, Anne Rice, Goethe, Baudelaire, Bram Stoker, as well as illustrators such as Brian Froud, Arthur Rackham, Edmund Dulac or Luis Royo and bands like Dark Sanctuary, whom she worked with in 2009. Likewise, a remarkable change in register can be observed in her work, as in Misty Circus or MandrakMoors, in which the author uses a style that may be considered less realistic and which is aimed at a much wider audience. Nonetheless, she maintains the essence of her work as a whole or the melancholy which endures in all her creations.

Organization Entrance of the OCA National Center The OCA National Center is located in Dupont Circle in Washington, D.C. and serves as the headquarters for OCA. The national office and staff monitor legislation and policy issues affecting Asian Pacific Americans. In addition, OCA is able to build national support and to work in coalition with other national groups around issues affecting Asian Pacific Americans. OCA takes no collective position on the politics of any foreign country, but instead focuses on the welfare and civil rights of Asian Pacific Americans in the United States. Goals The goals of OCA are to: * Advocate for social justice, equal opportunity and fair treatment * Promote civic participation, education, and leadership * Advance coalitions and community building * Foster cultural heritage To achieve these goals, OCA is engaged in organizing 100+ chapters and affiliates across the nation to develop both leadership and community involvement. History OCA was founded in 1973 to give voice and representation to Chinese Americans across the United States. Interest in civil rights advocacy had been growing in Chinese American communities since the late 1960s. OCA founders, among them Kung-Lee (K.L.) Wang, recognized a need for an organization to advocate for Chinese Americans on the national level in the same way as the NAACP and the JACL advocated for their respective ethnic groups. In September 1971, K.L. Wang and others established the Chinese American Leadership Council, the precursor to OCA, in Washington, DC. K.L. Wang then traveled to many cities in the U.S. to promote a national advocacy organization for Chinese Americans. In November 1971, at the urging of K.L. Wang, Alex Mark chaired a steering committee to establish a national organization for Chinese Americans in Detroit, MI. By February 1972, the Association of Chinese Americans was established and incorporated in Detroit, with Alex Mark as its first president. In late 1971, K.L. Wang also met with a group of about 20 Chinese Americans in the St. Louis community. This meeting lead to the formation of the League of Chinese Americans in early 1972. William Chang was elected its first president. On May 3, 1973, Alex Mark and K.L. Wang sent invitation letters for OCA membership to Chinese American communities in Detroit, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and Washington, DC. These pioneering groups came together at the first National Convention on June 9, 1973. One hundred twelve delegates from across the nation attended the convention, in which the constitution, bylaws and the name of the organization were adopted. Pauline Tsui of Washington, DC, served as the convention committee chair. Anna Chennault was instrumental in recruiting support from Congress and the Administration. K.L. Wang was elected as its first national president. The Association of Chinese Americans in Detroit, while retaining its name, became a chapter. The original OCA in Washington, DC evolved as a distinct chapter with Harry Woo as its first president. The League of Chinese Americans in St. Louis also joined, becoming the third founding chapter of OCA. In 2013, OCA's National Board of Directors passed a resolution to change its name to \\"OCA - Asian Pacific American Advocates\\" to reflect a more expansive mission to represent the pan-ethnic interests of the community. Chapters OCA has more than 50 chapters across the United States. Each chapter develops its own outreach programs, ranging from educational seminars and Chinese language schools to voter registration drives. OCA chapters address a number of issues including inaccurate media portrayals of APAs, failed employment practices, hate crimes, and educational access. They also implement programs that aim to foster youth development, leadership development, and professional development in the APA community. Controversies =2009: Miley Cyrus Incident= In early 2009, a photograph of Miley Cyrus circulated online in which she had the corners of her eyes pulled back, displaying a slant-eyed expression, while friends, including an Asian male, surrounding her posed in other manners. OCA was one of the first groups to respond to the photograph, by offering criticism and disapproval, hoping that \\"...Miley Cyrus will apologize to her fans and the APA community for this lapse in judgment and takes the opportunity to better understand why the gesture is offensive.\\" A few days later Miley responded on her website defending her actions, saying that \\"in NO way was I making fun of any ethnicity!\\" OCA Executive Director George Wu responded to Miley's response, by adding that, \\"It's not a real apology. We‚Äôre not backing down without a fuller apology.\\" National Convention Since its founding in 1973, OCA has held the largest annual conference dedicated to APA issues. Each year, the National Convention draws over 1,000 APA attendants from across the nation. The Convention is a platform for the recognition of unsung heroes of the APA community, exemplary local chapters, sponsors, summer interns, and current individuals making a difference in the APA community. Recognized individuals and speakers include former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, YouTube co-founder Steve Chen, and Congressman Mike Honda. Programs =APIA U: Leadership 101= A training session at Rice University in November 2009 Sponsored by State Farm, OCA visits colleges and universities every Fall and Spring semester to conduct a college leadership training program for Asian Pacific American student leaders and activists. The program focuses on the development of leadership and organizational skills that are relevant to APA campuses and communities. The interactive college leadership training program involves hands-on exercises, small group discussions, and presentations led by two qualified APIA facilitators. The one-day training assembles 60 students from each region and focuses on self-awareness, team-building, and direct action organizing. Participants are asked to challenge themselves, share their experiences, and develop leadership tools in order to serve effectively as catalysts for change. =APA-Y= =OCA Internship Program= 2009 Summer Interns (of the 20th anniversary class) pose for a photo at a local OCA chapter picnic The OCA internship program was first established in 1989 and has been a flagship component of OCA's involvement with college youth. The internship program enables college interns to learn firsthand about national issues and policies that affect Asian Pacific Americans in Washington, DC. In particular, the competitive summer program is known for attracting the best and brightest college students, as it is a 10-week-long program that places interns on Capitol Hill, at federal agencies, or at non-profit organizations (particularly APIA affiliated organizations). In the past, the summer program has offered interns the opportunity to participate in brown bag lunches on key issues affecting Asian Pacific Americans such as immigration reform and health care, and has included visits to congressional office buildings, where interns meet with representatives, APA staffers, and members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. Interns have also met with members of various government agencies such as the United States Department of Justice, the United States Department of Defense, and even White House staff members and directors to discuss issues concerning civil rights and voting rights, especially as it pertains to the APIA community. In addition, summer interns have also assisted the OCA National staff and the host OCA chapter staff at the annual OCA National Convention. The main internship placements are: * The OCA National Office (Summer, Fall, Winter & Spring) * Capitol Hill (Summer only) * Federal Agencies (Summer only) * Non-Profits (Summer only) =Scholarships= For over 10 years, OCA has provided assistance to deserving APA students achieve a college education.

The school offers programs of study in the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme and the Mid-Pacific School of the Arts (MPSA). Mid-Pacific Institute is located on in Manoa, near the University of Hawaii, close to downtown Honolulu. History The high school was established through the 1908 merger of Kawaiahao Seminary for Girls, founded in 1864, and Mills Institute for Boys, founded in 1892. Both schools were founded by missionaries, with the goal of teaching English to native Hawaiians, Japanese, Chinese and other nationalities. It was established that the school must remain Christian so long as the original land was in use. However, students are allowed to practice any religion of their choice. Even members of the Hawaiian royal family attended the schools. By opening its doors to students with no prejudice over race and class status, Mid-Pacific was a part of a growing movement toward greater social acceptance that was rarely seen in the repressive oligarchical control within the Territory of Hawaii. Tech Center and Kawaiahao Hall on the Campus of Mid-Pacific Institute A merger of the two schools was suggested in 1905 and the Hawaiian Board of Foreign Missions purchased 35 acres of land in Manoa valley. A ceremony was held on May 31, 1906 for the new school campus, which officially opened in 1908. The two schools continued to operate independently while co-existing in the new campus until the coeducation plan went into effect in the fall of 1922 and by June 1923 Mid-Pacific Institute became the common shared name. The school added an elementary school when it merged with Epiphany School (which had been established as an elementary mission school by the Episcopal Church in 1937) in 2004. The school had an on-campus dormitory from 1908 until it was closed in November 2003 and replaced by the new elementary school. On February 23, 2012, Mid-Pacific announced it had ordered 1,500 iPads for all students and faculty, making it one of the first schools in the nation to equip every student K-12 with an iPad. Mid-Pacific School of the Arts (MPSA) The Mid- Pacific School of the Arts offers a preprofessional certificate program in dance, instrumental music, drama, and fine arts. The MPSA is the only certified program of its kind in the state of Hawaii. Students who complete their studies often move on to professional conservatories and other schools of performing and fine arts. MPI is unique in requiring all of its students to take a number of arts electives. Students can take classes in dance, hula, instrumental music, media, musical theatre, theatre, visual arts, and voice. The Mid-Pacific School of the Arts, which was formally established in 1991, is a member of the International Network of Performing and Visual Arts Schools and was among the first six schools in the nation to be recognized by the organization as a Network Star School. It also received the Arts Excellence Award from the Hawaii Alliance for Arts Education. The International Baccalaureate The International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme is a widely recognized and highly regarded two-year pre-university educational program that emphasizes rigorous, internationally-based curriculum standards and promotes awareness and appreciation of global issues and perspectives. Students must take six subjects, and must also pass 3 extra requirements, for example, Theory of Knowledge (ToK), a 4000-word Extended Essay (EE), and a requirement of at least a total of 150 hours in CAS (Creativity, Action, Service). Mid-Pacific Institute was the first secondary school in the state of Hawaii to offer the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. The IB is administered by the International Baccalaureate Organization, which was founded in the 1968 in Geneva, Switzerland. Mid-Pacific Athletics The school's athletic affiliation is with the Interscholastic League of Honolulu. Mid-Pacific participates in intermediate, junior varsity and varsity level soccer, cross country, track & field, golf, softball, baseball, basketball, canoe paddling, tennis, bowling, volleyball, swimming and kayaking. Mid- Pacific Institute is one of nineteen smaller private schools that make up a larger unified team called Pac-5 Wolfpack, which allows the students to participate in certain high school athletic competition. Pac-Five began 35 years ago to allow smaller institutions (of 1000 or fewer students per school) to form a football team and compete at a varsity level with bigger schools. Now, Pac-5 competes in football, wrestling, judo and water polo. Mid-Pacific Institute has won state championships in baseball (1990-1992, 2002, 2013), Girls' Basketball (2017), Girls' Soccer (2011-2013), Boys' Soccer (2008, 2010, 2014, 2015), Boys' Sporter Air Riflery (2013, 2015, 2018), Girls' Sporter Air Riflery (2014, 2018), Girls' Swimming & Diving (2013, 2015), Boys' Canoe Paddling (2007), Boys' Golf (1985) and Softball (2011-2012).

It was also included in Robert Christgau's \\"Basic Record Library\\" of 1950s and 1960s recordings‚Äîpublished in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981)‚Äîand ranked No. 313 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. The selection became a classic cult song covered by a variety of artists and was his greatest commercial success, reportedly surpassing a million copies in sales, even though it failed to make the Billboard pop or R&B; charts. The original composition Hawkins had originally intended to record \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" as \\"a refined love song, a blues ballad\\". However, the producer (Arnold Maxin) \\"brought in ribs and chicken and got everybody drunk, and we came out with this weird version ... I don't even remember making the record. Before, I was just a normal blues singer. I was just Jay Hawkins. It all sort of just fell in place. I found out I could do more destroying a song and screaming it to death.\\" Julia Rubiner, Contemporary Musicians: Profiles of the People in Music, Volume 8, Gale, 1992, p.117 Hawkins first recorded \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" as a ballad during his stint with Grand Records in late 1955. However, that version was not released at the time (it has since been reissued on Hawkins' UK Rev-Ola CD The Whamee 1953‚Äì55). The following year, Hawkins re-recorded the song for Columbia's Okeh Records ‚Äì the notorious screaming version, which was released in October 1956. However, this version was banned from most radio programming for its outrageous 'cannibalistic' style. A truncated version was later released omitting the grunts and moans from the ending of the song, but the ban generally remained. Despite the restriction, the record still sold over a million copies. The hit brought Hawkins together with Cleveland disc jockey Alan Freed who promptly added him to his \\"Rock and Roll Revue\\". Up to this time, Hawkins had been a blues performer; emotional, but not wild. Freed suggested a gimmick to capitalize on the \\"demented\\" sound of \\"I Put a Spell on You\\": Hawkins wore a long cape, and appeared onstage by rising out of a coffin in the midst of smoke and fog. The act was a sensation, later bolstered by tusks worn in Hawkins' nose, on-stage snakes and fireworks, a cigarette- smoking skull named \\"Henry\\" and, ultimately, Hawkins transforming himself into \\"the black Vincent Price\\". This theatrical act was one of the first shock rock performances.Gillespie, Paula, and Neal Lerner. The Allyn and Bacon Guide to Peer Tutoring. Boston: Allyn, 2000. Print.

Such quantities can be for example an observable, a tensor or the Lagrangian of a theory. These kinds of symmetries, also known as internal symmetries, are distinguished from spacetime symmetries. For these local symmetries, one can apply a local transformation (resp. local gauge transformation), which means that the representation of the symmetry group is a function of the manifold and can thus be taken to act differently on different points of spacetime. Fields may have internal symmetries in addition to spacetime symmetries. In many situations, one needs fields which are a list of space-time scalars: (œÜ1, œÜ2, ... œÜN). For example, in weather prediction these may be temperature, pressure, humidity, etc. In particle physics, the color symmetry of the interaction of quarks is an example of an internal symmetry, that of the strong interaction. Other examples are isospin, weak isospin, charm, strangeness and any other flavour symmetry. If there is a symmetry of the problem, not involving spacetime, under which these components transform into each other, then this set of symmetries is called an internal symmetry. One may also make a classification of the charges of the fields under internal symmetries. Diffeomorphisms The diffeomorphism group is a local symmetry and thus every geometrical or generally covariant theory (i.e. a theory whose equations are tensor equations). General relativity has a local symmetry of diffeomorphisms (general covariance). This can be seen as generating the gravitational force. Special relativity only has a global symmetry (Lorentz symmetry or more generally Poincar√© symmetry). Local gauge symmetry There are many global symmetries (such as SU(2) of isospin symmetry) and local symmetries (like SU(2) of weak interactions) in particle physics. Often, the term local symmetry is associated with the local gauge symmetries in Yang‚ÄìMills theory. The Standard Model of particle physics consists of Yang- Mills Theories. In these theories, the Lagrangian is locally symmetric under some compact Lie group. Local gauge symmetries always come together with bosonic gauge fields, like the photon or gluon field, which induce a force in addition to requiring conservation laws. Supergravity The symmetry group of Supergravity is a local symmetry, whereas supersymmetry is a global symmetry.

He was previously Vice Chancellor of Brunel University in the UK and of Murdoch University in Western Australia. Schwartz is a trained psychologist and a university corporate manager by experience. He has publicly stated that he wishes universities to be more market-oriented, research- focused, accountable, transparent and held to higher standards, in the hope of improving the institutions' profiles and attracting more students, funding and researchers. This has included building new facilities and developing new schools in the universities he has managed such as Brunel University and Murdoch University. His style of management is not without controversy.  Biography  =Education and early years= Steven Schwartz was born in New York City in 1946. After attending public schools, he entered Brooklyn College of the City University of New York. He was a National Merit Scholar finalist and he received a New York State Regent Scholarship. After leaving the City University of New York, he was commissioned an officer in the Public Health Service serving at the National Institute of Mental Health before completing a PhD degree at Syracuse University as a US Public Health Service Fellow. He has also worked as a journalist, authoring many articles for research journals, magazines and newspapers. =Academic career= He began his academic career teaching at the Northern Illinois University. This led him to University of Texas Medical Branch where he was a full-time researcher in psychiatry. In 1978 he moved to Australia to take up the position of Senior Lecturer in clinical psychology at the University of Western Australia in Perth. In 1980, he transferred to the University of Queensland first as Reader and then as Professor of Psychology. He also served as visiting professor at Stanford University in 1983 and Harvard University in 1987. Over these years, Schwartz's research spanned clinical psychology, psychiatry, public health and medical decision making. He published over 100 articles in scientific journals, and 13 books including Medical Judgement and Decision Making (with Timothy Griffin), Childhood Psychopathology (with James Johnson, two editions), Pavlov‚Äôs Heirs and a well-known textbook on abnormal psychology, Abnormal Psychology, A Developmental Approach. Schwartz was named one of the 100 highest cited researchers in his field and he received many recognitions including a World Health Organization Fellowship, a NATO fellowship and the Australian Academy of Science-Royal Society (London) Exchange Fellowship. He was elected by his peers to the Academy of Social Sciences and he was elected Morris Leibovitz Fellow at the University of Southern California. Schwartz is a Fellow of the Royal Society of the Arts, the Australian Institute of Company Directors, and the Australian Institute of Management. He was a visiting Fellow of Wolfson College, Oxford and he won the Brain Research Award of the British Red Cross Society. He was elected the first President of Sigma Xi, The Scientific Research Society in Australia and was awarded the distinguished Career Scientist Award by the National Institutes of Health. He served on the editorial boards of many scientific journals and was a fellow of many learned societies. In 1988 he was appointed Head of the University of Queensland Psychology Department and then elected by the academic staff of the university to be President of the Academic Board, a position to which he was re-elected for a second term. His experience as Head and then President gave him an interest in administration which he followed by moving back to Perth to take up the position of Executive Dean in the School of Medicine and Dentistry at the University of Western Australia. He was the first medical Dean in Australia who was not a medical doctor. Although there was some scepticism about this among the medical establishment, Schwartz overcame this and his management came to the attention of the Murdoch University search committee which appointed Schwartz Vice Chancellor in 1996. =Vice chancellorships= Murdoch University During his tenure at Murdoch University he introduced a number of Feeder Colleges, restructured the University to become more research-focused and developed new courses to attract additional students. He also designed and built a branch campus at Rockingham (which won the Prime Minister's Institutional Award in 1998). To provide a permanent endowment for the University, he undertook a $100 million land development program, which included a housing estate, obtained ISO9000 quality approval for administrative functions, outsourced non-core business operations such as catering, won the WA Premier's Award for public sector management in 2000, the Prime Minister's National Employer of the Year in 2000, the Telstra National Employer of the Year 2000 and 2002, the Prime Minister's Teaching Award 1998 and began a mentoring program for women. In 2001, in the midst of union activity over a new contract and the protection of low enrolment courses, the members of the local union branch issued a vote of no confidence in him. Brunel University At the end of 2002, Schwartz was appointed Vice Chancellor of Brunel University in the United Kingdom: a university with 2,400 staff, 13,000 students and a yearly budget of ¬£140+ million. Brunel had decided under Michael Sterling, the previous VC, to refocus its mission on research. To help achieve this goal, the university under Schwartz sought to hire new research active staff, and, to help fund this, to reduce the number of non-research active staff (43 eventually accepted voluntary redundancy). The redundancy programme was highly controversial and was fiercely resisted by staff unions who ran a highly personalised campaign against Schwartz. As a part of the repositioning of the university, the Department of Geography and Earth Sciences was closed and the staff that didn't leave were redeployed (and one accepted voluntary redundancy). Despite the depleted staff base, Geography was still deemed strong enough to be returned in the 2008 RAE when it received an average score of 2.15 out of a possible 5. Schwartz's changes were supposed to produce increased research output and RAE ratings, bolstering the economic viability of the university. Brunel moved up the university league tables, (but has since fallen back), international income doubled, entry scores of students rose, the first venture capital trust for a university was established, and management was completely restructured. Similar to the experience at Murdoch, cutbacks led to staff action, including picketing and paid ads on Google. In 2004, Schwartz was asked by the British government to chair an inquiry into university admissions. This inquiry became the focus of much political interest and media coverage. The Schwartz report was completed in September 2004 and its recommendations were far-reaching and controversial. The reports can be found at Schwartz also led a national project on ethics for universities sponsored by the Council for Industry and Higher Education and Universities UK. In 2007 a tribunal found Schwartz guilty of victimisation by an employment tribunal after he publicly implied that two members of Brunel staff had made unwarranted claims against the university.(see Times Higher Ed, 7 Dec 2007) In 2005, after the two staff members had lost claims of race discrimination against the university, Professor Schwartz emailed all of the staff criticising the pair (although neither were named). Bemoaning the expense of defending the cases, he referred to the two as having made \\"unwarranted demands for money\\" and described their claims as \\"unfounded\\", \\"unmeritorious\\" and \\"futile\\". The tribunal concluded that the claimants' sense of grievance was reasonable and justified: \\"Professor Schwartz's assertion that the claimants had made unwarranted demands for money was an implicit assertion of dishonesty on their part,\\" it said. The earlier tribunal, while dismissing the cases of discrimination, had accepted that they were made in good faith. The tribunal awarded the two claimants ¬£7,500 each as compensation for injury to their feelings, and said that, as Professor Schwartz and the university were equally responsible, so each should be liable for half of each award. Macquarie University In 2006, Schwartz left Brunel, returning to Australia to take up the position of Vice Chancellor at Macquarie University where he made similar changes to those imposed at Brunel. Arguing that he sought to refocus the university around peaks of research excellence, he said that this would mean \\"moving from teaching the subjects teachers want to teach to the subjects students want to learn; ensuring institutional success rather than ensuring morale; and decentralising responsibility and accountability\\". He added more than 85 new research active staff, including a new group of postgraduate medical researchers, attracted hundreds of millions in new development funds and the university rose in the Shanghai Jiao Tong ratings. In June, 2012, Macquarie was ranked 16 in the world in the QS rankings of 50 universities under 50 years of age and 32 in the world by a similar poll published by the THES In both cases, Macquarie was ranked first or tied first in Australia. In May 2008, he announced a search for an additional 43 staff. Schwartz has had to deal with a difficult legacy. There were run-ins with the former Vice-Chancellor, Di Yerbury. Union action was taken over staff contract conditions and issues regarding faculty and department funding. Schwartz has overseen considerable cuts to the university's infrastructure (though actually $1 billion was spent on infrastructure during his tenure including the new library, Macquarie University Hospital, the Hearing Hub and the Cochlear Building).mq.edu.au/pubstatic/public/download.jsp?id=122177 Schwartz had: * Planned to shut down the post-graduate student representative association (MUPRA). The dispute has continued after Schwartz left the university. * Remove the position of student groups co-ordinator and replace it with a more workable system. * Removed the honours programs for most degrees and replaced them with the master's degree. Macquarie University announced on 13 April 2012 that Professor S Bruce Dowton would succeed Schwartz as Vice-Chancellor. Schwartz left the role after six years in office and is the university's shortest serving Vice Chancellor. Schwartz was 66 at retirement and his contract had already been extended by two years. He went on to a visiting position at Oxford University. =Other roles= Schwartz is the Chairman of the Australian-American Fulbright Commission and a member of the advisory boards of the Asia Society, the Global Foundation and the Centre for Independent Studies, an Australasian libertarian thinktank \\"actively engaged in supporting a free enterprise economy and a free society under limited government where individuals can prosper and fully develop their talents\\". He is the Chair of the Minister's Advisory Committee on the Bologna Process. He also represents Australia on the Council of the University of the South Pacific.

The district is bounded by Majuli on north, Nagaland state on the south, Charaideo on the east and Golaghat on the west. On the north of the district, the river Brahmaputra forms the largest riverine island of the world. The administrative seat is at Jorhat city. Jorhat was previously a sub-division of undivided Sibsagar district. In 1983 Jorhat was carved out of Sibsagar District and was made a separate district. Etymology \\"Jorhat\\" (‡¶Ø‡ßã‡ß∞‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶ü) or \\"Jorehaut\\" means two \\"hats\\" (Bazar) or \\"mandis\\"- \\"Macharhat\\" (‡¶Æ‡¶æ‡¶õ‡ß∞‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶ü) and \\"Chowkihat\\" (‡¶ö‡¶ï‡ßÄ‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶ü) which existed on the two different banks of the river Bhugdoi during the 18th century. History The northernmost area of the present district was a part of the Chutiya Kingdom before the Ahom-Chutiya war in the 16th century. In 1794 the Ahom king Gaurinath Singha shifted the capital from Sibsagar (erstwhile \\"Rangpur\\") to Jorhat. This town was a flourishing and commercial metropolis but completely destroyed after a series of the Burmese invasions since 1817 till the arrival of the British force in 1824 under the Stewardship of David Scott and Captain Richard. The British rule, though, was not free from rebellions and revolutions, contributed to reemergence of this historical town. From the very first decade of the British rule, the great revolutionists who emerged were Gomdhar Konwar, Jeuram and Piyali, British system of administration, came into vogue in 1839 with an established Police Thana. During the great Sepoy Mutiny, the anti-British plot hatched by Maniram Dewan and Piyali Barua, was sabotaged. These leaders were hanged in public at this very place in 1858. In 1885, a narrow-gauge train service (Jorehaut Provincial Railway) came into operation and ultimately became instrumental in the rapid growth of the tea industry.

Biography James King was born on Warbester Hoy, in the Orkney Islands. He was recruited into the Swedish Army in 1615, and in 1622 he was a Captain in Ruthven's regiment. By 1634 King had gained some prominence and commanded three of the regiments at the siege of Hildersheim. For this action he was promoted Major General. By 1636, he was a Lieutenant General and commanded the left wing of the Swedish Army at the Battle of Wittstock as part of Alexander Leslie's Army of the Weser. His report of the battle, and his role within it lay undetected until recently, but has now been published. After Wittstock, King's cavalry formed an Army Volante supported by his fellow Scot, Major General John Ruthven who had also fought at Wittstock. The conducted a largely successful campaign around Minden throughout early 1637. However, the Swedish campaign began to falter and problems arose with the German allies. Many of the Scots found themselves unpopular in wishing to press for the Restoration of the Palatinate causing tensions with some of their Swedish allies. Moreover, tensions in Scotland saw Leslie leave to form the Army of the Covenant in Scotland leaving King in charge of the remnant Army of the Weser. With this much reduced force, coupled with fresh levies from England led by William Lord Craven, King was defeated at the Battle of Vlotho. Craven and Prince Rupert of the Rhine were captured by the victorious Imperialists. It was unfortunate that King blamed Rupert's rashness for the defeat, while Rupert in turn blamed King's caution. After quarrels with the Swedish commanders, King was sidelined to duties in Stockholm, although he was ennobled. He travelled to Hamburg in 1639, where King Charles employed him initially as a military recruiter. He sat out the Bishops' Wars between Charles I and the Scottish Covenanters, thus avoiding conflict with his long-time comrade, Alexander Leslie. Indeed, his actions may have been sanctioned by Leslie who appeared to constantly protect him in the Scottish Parliament. However, his two surviving wills indicate that King was either a Roman Catholic or High Lutheran as he invokes the Holy Trinity in each - something not common in the typical Scottish testament of the period.; After the Civil War broke out in England in 1642, King was created Lord Eythin and was despatched to the continent once more to recruit experienced soldiers from the various European armies and acquire munitions. He returned to England in the suite of Queen Henrietta Maria. Landing at Bridlington, he was appointed Lieutenant General to the Marquess of Newcastle. On 2 July 1644, Prince Rupert relieved York, where Newcastle's army had been besieged. Rupert had fallen out with the Lord General of Royalist forces, Patrick Ruthven, who left the army to join the king after an argument with Rupert. Devoid of an infantry commander, Rupert summoned Newcastle's troops to join him on Marston Moor, where he was preparing for battle with the Covenanter and Parliamentarian besiegers led by Alexander Leslie. The meeting in the late afternoon between Rupert and King was apparently chilly. In the subsequent Battle of Marston Moor, the Royalist army was destroyed, the Royalist cavalry losing discipline and heading off in pursuit of plunder rather than hammering home their initial advantage. Newcastle and his senior officers, among them King, went into exile in Hamburg after quitting Rupert's service in disgust. In March 1650 he was to have taken part as Lieutenant General in Montrose‚Äôs expedition which initially landed in the Orkney Islands. But before he left Sweden, he aborted his mission to support Montrose, because Charles II reached an accommodation with the Covenanters and abandoned Montrose (who was subsequently captured by the Covenanters and executed in Edinburgh).

It is North America's largest and most competitive dragon boat festival with over 200 crews competing from around the world, with roots stemming from Expo 86. The Concord Pacific Dragon Boat Festival is run by the Canadian International Dragon Boat Festival Society (commonly Dragon Boat BC). The Concord Pacific Dragon Boat Festival is a legacy of Expo 86, where Vancouver's Chinese-Canadian community introduced the traditional annual Chinese Duanwu Festival (summer solstice) to Canada as a cultural outreach program to share Chinese culture with the city's multi- cultural population. The dragon boat festival was created to promote sport and Chinese culture, and a meeting place for Vancouver's culturally diverse population to build intercultural harmony and understanding. Visitors experience a variety of ethnically themed food, cultural entertainment, fine arts and children's programming reflecting Vancouver's cultural diversity, and some of the world's most competitive dragon boat races. The festival has grown to become one of Vancouver's largest family summer events, attracting paddlers ranging in age from high school students to 'grand dragons' in their 80s, and visitors including families of all ages and backgrounds. The festival celebrates community, culture, and competition by connecting visitors with dragon boat racing, cultural displays, and community organizations that support accessible activity and programs. History Volunteers made trips to Hong Kong in 1984 to investigate how to import teak dragon boats. The City of Vancouver Centennial Commission endorsed the plan for an inaugural festival as part of the official civic anniversary festivities. The local committee contacted the Hong Kong Tourism Board (HKTB), and with the financial assistance of businesses connected to Hong Kong (Cathay Pacific Airways, Sing Tao and Empire Stevedoring), brought six teak wooden dragon boats built in Hong Kong to Vancouver for Expo 86. These boats were on display at the Marine Plaza Zone when they were not being used for practices, competitions or ceremonial purposes in support of the Hong Kong Pavilion. In 1986, the Chinese Cultural Centre of Vancouver organized and hosted the first authentic dragon boat festival in North America, and invited prominent community leaders to be patrons. This committee maintained the fleet of 9 teak dragon boats after 3 more were purchased, under the leadership of Dr. Wallace Chung and Dr. S. Wah Leung. Part of this group of founding volunteers includes David See-Chai Lam and Milton K. Wong, who would later reorganize the Vancouver Festival as the Canadian International Dragon Boat Festival in 1988. Mason Hung, senior IDBF vice-president and Product Development Manager with the HKTB, came to Vancouver as a consultant. The first races adapted the Hong Kong festival's racing rules for use on False Creek, which, like Hong Kong's Victoria Harbour course, is subject to tidal currents. These volunteers organized instruction and training for novices who had never paddled before out of the False Creek Community Centre, home of the recently started False Creek Racing Canoe Club. The popularity of dragon boat racing began to grow quickly- initially there were around 30 teams competing, but this number continued to grow each year to over 100 by the early 1990s. In 1998, an Asia-Pacific food fair along with performances and entertainment at the Plaza of Nations inspired organizers to expand the dragon boat festival to include a cultural component like in Hong Kong. In 1989, the festival invited and hosted international dragon boat teams to compete, starting with a women's team from Australia and a men's team from Great Britain. Over the next few years, teams flew over from Indonesia, Japan, England, Germany and Australia to compete against teams from Canada and the USA. In recent years, international teams have returned to Vancouver as the festival has grown, with teams participating from around the world, including from China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the US, Great Britain, Australia, Singapore, Germany, the United Arab Emirates, and many other countries from around the world. In 1996, 10 years after Vancouver's first race, the 1st IDBF Club Crew World Championships was convened on False Creek during the festival. The 1996 Club Crew World Championships marked the first time that a state-sponsored dragon boat team from China competed outside Asia. Crews competing also flew in from Australia, New Zealand, Germany and England. In 2008, the festival was rebranded from the Alcan Dragon Boat Festival to the Rio Tinto Alcan Dragon Boat Festival. In 2012, the Society received 8 BuK dragon boats as a donation from Concord Pacific's Terry Hui in honour of Milton Wong, expanding the fleet to 18 BuK dragon boats, and allowing the festival to be raced entirely in BuK boats. In 2016, after many years of support from Rio Tinto Alcan, founding sponsor Concord Pacific became the new title partner of the Concord Pacific Dragon Boat Festival. Concord Pacific also donated $1 million to build a new community boathouse for community paddling operations to support the dragon boat festival and its year round paddling club. The Creekside Paddling Centre houses the festival's equipment and boats year round for use. The festival also expanded back to Concord Pacific Place and Creekside Park in 2016 after being run in the Olympic Village Plaza and Creekside Community Centre. Race Course and Festival Site The initial races for Expo 86 were held on the water just to the west of the Cambie Street Bridge. The original race course of 6 lanes were 640 m in length, the same distance as in Hong Kong's Tsim Sha Tsui harbour. The number of lanes increased to 9 as the number of boats available for racing increased, and as registered teams grew from 18 in 1986, to 100 in the 1990s, to over 150 in the 2000s, to 200+ today. The distance also was changed to 500 m, keeping with the development of international racing standards. The race course is subject to tidal streams or currents. The water can be flowing in the same direction boats race (similar effect to a tail wind: shorter time required to go from the start line to the finish line), the opposite direction (similar effect to a head wind: longer time required to go from start to finish), or there is no current during slack tide. The land portion of the festival has also varied over the last 2 dozen years. Historic venues include the Plaza of Nations on the north shore, Creekside Park on the east shore and Creekside Community Recreation Centre on the south shore. The current Festival site runs along the False Creek seawall starting from Concord Pacific Place on the North shore, to Creekside Park on the East shore, to the Creekside Paddling Centre on the South shore. Concord Pacific Dragon Boat Festival in Vancouver Festival Races The festival's main divisions are in Premier Mixed and Premier Women. These two divisions each feature a sequence of 500 m races, with the fastest teams then racing in a 2,000 m turns race, where up to 18 boats race in a time trial. Up to 42 Junior Mixed teams compete in a separate division, featuring a sequence of 500 m heats, semi finals, and finals. Other divisions include a Premier Open division. Specialty races include the International Cup (visiting teams face off against Canadian teams in a sequence of races leading up to a 200 m knockout final), the Barrier Free Canada Cup (100 m knockout sprint raising money for seven charities), Breast Cancer Championship, U24 Cup, Grand Dragon's Cup, and Cancer Survivor race. Dragon Zone Paddling Club The festival's producers, the Canadian International Dragon Boat Festival Society also operates a series of races and runs Dragon Zone Paddling Club out of Creekside Paddling Centre and Creekside Community Centre. Dragon Zone is a year-round paddling facility on False Creek that offers dragon boat, flatwater kayak and canoe, and outrigger programs for people of all ages, abilities, and competitive levels out of a fully accessible facility. The Society also runs the Dragon Zone Youth Regatta (race for youth in early May), the Dragon Zone Spring Sprint (race in 10 person dragon boats in early May), the Dragon Zone 500 M Regatta (BC's second largest race with over 100 teams in early June), and the Steveston Dragon Boat Festival (last race in the Vancouver dragon boat race calendar in late August). Over 50 teams regularly train out of Dragon Zone year round, including recreational or competitive teams. The club also offers introduction programs for dragon boat, youth summer flatwater paddling camps, one day programs, community paddling days, and other cultural and paddling programs in partnership with other community organizations.

Endometrial ablation should never be performed on women who wish to have children. Endometrial ablation is most often employed in women who suffer from excessive menstrual bleeding, who have failed medical therapy and do not wish to undergo a hysterectomy. Heavy menstrual bleeding is most commonly due to dysfunctional uterine bleeding or adenomyosis. The procedure is almost always performed as an outpatient treatment, either at the hospital, ambulatory surgery center, or physician office. The Endometrial Ablation procedure is primarily performed while patients are under local and/or light sedative anesthesia, or if necessary, general or spinal anesthesia. Patients normally leave the treatment facility within one hour following the procedure and generally spend one day resting at home, before returning to the activities of daily living. After the procedure, the endometrium heals by scarring over, thus reducing or eliminating future uterine bleeding. The patient's hormonal functions will remain unaffected because the ovaries are left intact. Placenta accreta may occur if the patient becomes pregnant after endometrial ablation, so birth control is necessary. Depending on the treatment that is chosen, endometrial ablation is sometimes conducted after treatment with hormones, such as norethisterone or Lupron to reduce the thickness of the endometrium. Risks  Although rare, the procedure can have serious complications including: * Bowel burn leading to death * Burns to the uterus (beyond the endometrial lining) * Perforation of the uterus * Post-ablation tubal sterilization syndrome * Pulmonary edema or embolism  Sterilization  Women who wish to become pregnant should not undergo endometrial ablation; pregnancy is rare (less than 2 percent) and can have mortal risks for the mother and child.  Effectiveness  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves and audits clinical studies to test and evaluate the effectiveness of all endometrial ablation treatments. Two patient effectiveness outcomes are measured at one year following treatment: 1.) Success Rate = the % of women who have their bleeding reduced to a normal period level or less, and 2.) Amenorrhea Rate = the % of women that have their bleeding completely eliminated. According to the results of the Randomized Controlled Trials performed for the FDA approval of the different treatment options, effectiveness Success Rates range from a high of 93% to a low of 67%, and the Amenorrhea Rates range from a high of 72% to a low of 22%.  Treatment options  A number of treatment options are available. They all work by destroying (ablating) the endometrium, the lining of the uterine cavity. * The NovaSure ‚Äì Endometrial Ablation System (Hologic), FDA approved in 2001, utilizes a metallized mesh electrode array that is introduced into the uterine cavity, applying bipolar electrical energy that creates heat to ablate (destroy) the endometrium. The Novasure average procedure time is 5 minutes from device insertion to removal and is usually performed under local and/or conscious sedation anesthesia. Most patients leave the treatment center within one hour of treatment. In the Novasure Randomized Controlled Trial for FDA approval, the Success Rate was 78% (bleeding reduced to a normal or less level) and Amenorrhea Rate was 36% (bleeding completely eliminated). In addition, 92% of the Novasure patients were Satisfied. * The Minerva ‚Äì Endometrial Ablation System (Minerva Surgical), FDA approved in July 2015, is the first new FDA-approved surgical treatment for heavy menstrual bleeding in over 15 years. Minerva works by generating heat from plasma energy that is created and contained inside a leak-proof ablation array that takes the shape of the uterine cavity. The hot membrane surface of the array ablates (destroys) the endometrium. The Minerva procedure is the fastest FDA approved treatment, average procedure time is 3.1 minutes from device insertion to removal, and is usually performed under local and/or conscious sedation anesthesia. Most patients leave the treatment center within one hour of treatment. In the Minerva Randomized Controlled Trial for FDA approval, the Success Rate was 93% (bleeding reduced to a normal or less level) and Amenorrhea Rate was 72% (bleeding completely eliminated). In addition, 95% of the Minerva patients, \\"Would recommend Minerva to a family member or friend\\") and 92% of the patients were Satisfied. * The Genesys HTA ‚Äì Hydro-Thermal Ablation System (Boston Scientific), FDA approved in 2001, uses a hysteroscope device which is inserted into the uterus through the cervical canal, to help doctors safely confirm proper probe placement and to see the area they are treating. In this procedure, the doctor looks at the inside of the uterus with the hysteroscope and then fills the uterus with saline fluid. The fluid is then slowly heated and the lining of the uterus is burned so that menstrual bleeding periods become less heavy and, in some cases, even stops. The fluid is then cooled and removed by special tubing to protect the external areas of the body from any burns. The average procedure time is 26 minutes. In the HTA Randomized Controlled Trial for FDA approval, the Success Rate was 68% (normal or less bleeding) and Amenorrhea Rate was 35% (bleeding completely eliminated). 94% of the HTA patients were Satisfied. * The Her Option ‚Äì Endometrial Ablation System (Cooper Surgical), FDA approved in 2001, is a treatment that creates sub-zero temperatures to freeze and ablate the endometrium. Following the application of local anesthetic around the cervix, a physician uses ultrasound to guide the placement of a cryoprobe to the right uterine horn (cornua). The cryoprobe is activated, reducing its temperature to minus 60¬∞C. The cryoprobe is kept in place while ice is formed in the uterine cavity, under ultrasound observation. Once the appropriate time has passed and/or the appropriate depth of ice has been achieved, the cryoprobe is warmed to 37¬∞C. The cryoprobe is then repositioned to the untreated left uterine horn and the procedure is repeated. Finally, the cryoprobe is warmed and removed. In the Her Option Randomized Controlled Trial for FDA approval, the Success Rate was 67% (bleeding reduced to a normal or less level) and Amenorrhea Rate was 22% (bleeding completely eliminated). In addition, 86% of the Her Option patients were Satisfied. * Transcervical Resection of the Endometrium (TCRE) or Loop Resection with Rollerball Ablation as it is commonly called, utilizes a hysteroscope, through which a bi-polar radio frequency electrocautery cutting loop is deployed to resect (remove) the superficial endometrium, followed by a bi-polar radio frequency rollerball tool to ablate the remaining underlying endometrium via cauterization.Hysteroscopic Surgery, by King‚Äôs College Hospital. August 2013 It is a proven procedure, being a day-care procedure with rapid recovery.Page 122 in * The 'Thermachoice III '- balloon (Johnson and Johnson), FDA approved in 1997, was taken off the market in December 2015. This system utilized a heated saline filled balloon which was inserted into the uterine cavity to ablate the endometrium. The fluid was safely contained in a flexible and non-allergenic Silastic membrane that conformed to most uterine cavity shapes and sizes. Older methods utilize hysteroscopy to insert instruments into the uterus to destroy the lining under visualization using a laser, or microwave probe.

His title was Cardinal-Priest of Immacolata al Tiburtino. Early life Reginald Delargey was born in Timaru, one of six children. The family moved several times during Delargey's early years, and Delargey was sent to Auckland to receive his secondary education as a boarder at Sacred Heart College. His mother died in 1929, three years before Delargey commenced his studies for the priesthood at Holy Cross College, Mosgiel, where his considerable academic potential was recognised and he was sent to Rome to complete his studies at the Pontifical Urbaniana University. Priesthood Delargey was ordained as a priest for the Diocese of Auckland in Rome on 19 March 1938. After returning to New Zealand, he worked in the parish of Takapuna and at St Patrick's Cathedral, Auckland. From 1940 to 1947 he was Director of Catholic Social Services for the Diocese of Auckland. He also served as director of the Catholic Youth Movement and was the chaplain at St Peter's College for 18 years.Foreword by R J Delargey, St Peter's College Magazine 1970, p. 3: \\"For years, St Peter's was my second home. Mass in the morning for the Brothers, and classes for the boys was the routine for over eighteen years\\". Bishop of Auckland Delargey was appointed as Auxiliary Bishop for the Diocese of Auckland on 25 November 1957. During his time as Auxiliary Bishop he attended all four sessions of the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II). Twelve years after his appointment as Auxiliary, Delargey was appointed as Bishop of Auckland on 18 September 1970 following the retirement of Archbishop James Liston. As bishop, he adopted a humble and open style of leadership, putting into practice the ideas and principles of Vatican II. After four years as Bishop of Auckland, and after the death of Cardinal Peter McKeefry he was translated to the Metropolitan See in Wellington and became its Archbishop on 25 April 1974. Archbishop of Wellington Although not from Wellington, Delargey built a strong relationship with the people and clergy of the Archdiocese as a result of his openness, humility and sincerity. As Archbishop he continued to promote the work of the Catholic Youth Movement ‚Äì as he had previously done in Auckland ‚Äì and was particularly conscious of the needs of minority groups both in the Archdiocese and throughout New Zealand. Delargey was created Cardinal priest on 24 May 1976 by Pope Paul VI and received the title of Inmmacolata al Tiburtino. From 1976 to 1979 he was head of the New Zealand Catholic Bishops' Conference and played a key role in the negotiations with the government and teachers' unions that culminated in the integration of Catholic schools into the State funded system in New Zealand. Despite failing health, he participated in the conclaves of August and October 1978. He died in Auckland in 1979 and was buried from Wellington's Sacred Heart Cathedral. He was succeeded by Thomas Stafford Williams.

Burmese pagodas are stupas that typically house Buddhist relics, including relics associated with Buddha. Pagodas feature prominently in Myanmar's landscape, earning the country the moniker \\"land of pagodas.\\" According to 2016 statistics compiled by the State Sangha Maha Nayaka Committee, Myanmar is home to 1,479 pagodas exceeding in height, a quarter of which are located in Sagaing Region. Several cities in the country, including Mandalay and Bagan, are known for their abundance of pagodas. Pagodas are the site of seasonal pagoda festivals. Burmese pagodas are enclosed in a compound known as the aran (·Ä°·Ä¨·Äõ·Ä¨·Äô·Ä∫, from Pali ƒÅrƒÅma), with gateways called mok (·Äô·ÄØ·ÄÅ·Ä∫, from Pali mukha) at the four cardinal directions. The platform surrounding a Burmese pagoda is called a yinbyin (·Äõ·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äï·Äº·ÄÑ·Ä∫).  Terms  Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon is Myanmar's most prominent zedi. Ananda Temple in Bagan is a classic example of a pahto. In the Burmese language, pagodas are known by a number of various terms. The umbrella term phaya (, pronounced ), which derives from Sanskrit vara, refers to pagodas, images of the Buddha, as well as royal and religious personages, including the Buddha, kings, and monks. Zedi (·ÄÖ·Ä±·Äê·ÄÆ), which derives from Pali cetiya, specifically refers to typically solid, bell-shaped stupas that may house relics. Pahto (·Äï·ÄØ·Äë·Ä≠·ÄØ·Ä∏) refers to hollow square or rectangular buildings built to resemble caves, with chambers that house images of the Buddha. Burmese pagodas are distinguished from kyaungs in that the latter are monasteries that house Buddhist monks.  Types  Burmese zedis are classified into four prevalent types: # Datu zedi (·Äì·Ä¨·Äê·ÄØ·ÄÖ·Ä±·Äê·ÄÆ, from Pali dhƒÅtucetiya) or datdaw zedi (·Äì·Ä¨·Äê·Ä∫·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·ÄÖ·Ä±·Äê·ÄÆ) - zedis enshrining relics of the Buddha or arhats # Paribawga zedi (·Äï·Äõ·Ä≠·Äò·Ä±·Ä¨·ÄÇ·ÄÖ·Ä±·Äê·ÄÆ, from Pali paribhogacetiya) - zedis enshrining garments and other items (alms bowls, robes, etc.) that belonged to the Buddha or sacred personages # Dhamma zedi (·Äì·Äô·Äπ·Äô·ÄÖ·Ä±·Äê·ÄÆ, from Pali dhammacetiya) - zedis enshrining sacred texts and manuscripts, along with jewels and precious metals # Odeiktha zedi (·Ä•·Äí·Äπ·Äí·Ä≠·Äø·ÄÖ·Ä±·Äê·ÄÆ, from Pali uddissacetiya) - zedis built from motives of piety, containing statues of the Buddha, models of sacred images Of the four classes, dhammazedis and udeikthazedis are the most prevalent, since they are routinely erected by donors as a work of merit. Burmese zedis are typically constructed with bricks, covered with whitewashed stucco. Prominent zedis are gilded with gold. Burmese zedis are crowned with a spired final ornament known as the hti, which is hoisted in a traditional ceremony (·Äë·ÄÆ·Ä∏·Äê·Ä±·Ä¨·Ä∫·Äê·ÄÑ·Ä∫·Äï·ÄΩ·Ä≤, htidaw tin pwe) that dates to the pre-colonial era.
