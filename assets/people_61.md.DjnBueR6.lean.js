It is the junior award of a set of three decorations for merit, along with the Distinguished Service Medal, Gold and the Distinguished Service Medal, Silver. Venda's military decorations and medals were modelled on those of the Republic of South Africa and these three decorations are the approximate equivalents of, respectively, the Southern Cross Decoration and Pro Merito Decoration, the Southern Cross Medal (1975) and Pro Merito Medal (1975), and the Military Merit Medal. Award criteria The medal could be awarded to all ranks for service of a high standard.

Dylan Osborne was elected to succeed him in the November, 2018 election that saw most Republicans in county-wide offices replaced by Democrats. A naturalized citizen, Sanchez has made political history as the first Latino immigrant to be elected to a citywide position in Houston, when he won the at-large seat on the city council, to which he was twice re-elected in consecutive terms, serving 1995–2001. In 2001 and 2003 he ran for mayor of Houston, gaining an alliance with Republican Anglos and generating high voter turnout in the Hispanic community. Both times he made it to the runoffs. When elected as Treasurer of Harris County, he was the first Latino immigrant to win a countywide, non-judicial elected office in that county. Early life and education Sanchez was born in Havana, Cuba to native Cuban parents. His parents emigrated after the Cuban Revolution when he was a young child. The family stayed for a brief time in Venezuela, before settling in Houston in 1962. Sanchez has lived here since. Former Harris County Judge Roy Hofheinz hired Sanchez's father, Orlando Sanchez-Diago, as a broadcaster to be the \\"Spanish voice\\" of the Colt .45s baseball club, which subsequently was renamed the Houston Astros. Sanchez grew up in southwest Houston, where he graduated from Bellaire High School (Bellaire, Texas). He joined the U.S. Air Force in 1976. After his tour, he enlisted in the 147th Fighter Interceptor Group of the Texas Air National Guard at the then-named Ellington Field. He attended the University of Houston and graduated cum laude with a degree in political science. In 1997, Sanchez was the University of Houston Social Sciences' Outstanding Young Alum and in 2001 received the Distinguished Alumnus Award. Political career Sanchez joined the Republican Party and first ran for office in 1992 as the Republican nominee for Texas House District 132. In 1993 he was a candidate for Houston City Council in District C. In 1995, Sanchez successfully ran citywide for at-large position on the Houston City Council, where he served three terms, January 1996 to January 2002, stepping down due to term limits. He was the first Latino immigrant to be elected citywide in Houston's history. The Harris County Republican Party awarded Sanchez the 'Political Courage Award' for his vote to cut property taxes in Houston for the first time in decades. In 2001, Sanchez ran for Mayor of the City of Houston against the two-time incumbent Lee P. Brown, the former police chief of the city, and a fellow city councilman, Chris Bell. Sanchez, who gained 40% of the vote, faced Brown, who had 43%, in a run-off; Chris Bell received 16% of the ballots cast. The centerpiece of Sanchez' campaign was public safety: he called for four fire fighters on each fire truck as the minimum needed to preserve lives and safety of the force, gaining the union's endorsement. On September 11, 2001, fire fighters helping victims in the World Trade Center attacks became national heroes; this helped to elevate the profile of Sanchez' cause. In October 2001, Houston Fire Captain Jay Janhke was killed while putting out a fire. Mayor Brown was strongly criticized and the Fire Department policy changed its policy, staffing four fighters per truck as the standard for each call. In the non-partisan election, Sanchez developed a coalition that included the Hispanic community, Asian business leaders, Republicans and independent voters. Historically, Hispanic turnout in Houston races hovered around 10%, but nearly 18% of Hispanic voters turned out in this race, with more than 77% voting for Sanchez. Voter turnout in the 2001 mayoral race between Sanchez and Brown was historic. In addition to the near doubling of Latino voter turnout, the total number of voters in the December run-off remains the highest in Houston's history as of 2015. Sanchez narrowly lost the race by 10,702 votes. In 2003, Sanchez ran for mayor against Bill White, a businessman and well-connected Democrat, and Sylvester Turner, a state representative and former candidate for mayor against then-Mayor Bob Lanier. Sanchez had improved his name identification in this race. Since his 2001 campaign, he had been offered several other opportunities, but said, \\"I knew, standing on that podium, looking at the crowd, that I would run again in 2003,\\" Sanchez said. \\"It's what I want to do and be. When I start something, I stick to it.\\" Sanchez made the run-off, but lost to Bill White in the general election. He was elected Harris County Treasurer in 2006 making him the first Latino immigrant in Harris County to be elected to a countywide non-judicial office. Sanchez was reelected in 2010 and again in 2014. He lost in 2018 to Dylan Osborne, as Democratic candidates swept most contested Harris County races. =County Treasurer= As County Treasurer, Orlando Sanchez oversaw Harris County's multiple bank accounts, paid the county's expenses and was an independent set of eyes in overseeing spending of county taxpayer dollars. The treasurer's office won several transparency awards after Sanchez took office including Sunny Awards for transparency in 2010 and 2011 from the Sunshine Review and achieved Platinum Level in the Texas State Comptroller's Leadership Circle for Transparency in Local Government Reporting. Civic activities Sanchez sat on the Harris County Bail Bonds Board, is a member of the Board of Directors of Capital Bank Texas, a life member of the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo and the 100 Club of Houston. He is a member of the University of Houston Foundation Board of Directors and is a former advisory member of the University of Houston Law School Foundation. He is a fellow of the British- American Project and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations. He is a current advisory member of Volunteer Interfaith Caregivers-Southwest. He is also a member of the Patriot Guard Riders, a group that participates in memorial services honoring Fallen Military Heroes, First Responders and Honorably Discharged Veterans. Personal life Orlando Sanchez is married to Julye Vanessa Croix-Sanchez, a television journalist and anchor. His daughter, Aubrie M. Sanchez, is a 2010 graduate with an IB from the Awty International School in Houston.

Diplomatic service  Chodacki was given the function of ministerial adviser in the Political Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On October 24, 1935, he became chargé d’affaires in the Polish mission to Czechoslovakia. He was a confidante of the foreign minister Józef Beck, who considered him the best politician among the officers transferred from military service to diplomacy.Mikos (referenced above) quotes the Diary and files of Jan Szembek, 1934-1939, t. 1-4, London 1964-1972. On December 30,December 16 according to Majchrowski 1936 Chodacki assumed the office of the Commissioner General of the Republic of Poland in the Free City of Gdańsk. During his term of office, he attained the rank of authorized minister (minister pełnomocny) and special envoy (poseł nadzwyczajny). His uncompromising attitude as General Commissioner caused the quarreling Polish organizations in Gdańsk to unite. As for the Polish policy toward the Free City, it did not change under Chodacki and continued to be marked by a strong opposition to the Nazification of the city. The Commissioner often intervened in the defense of Poles, whose health and life at the time was frequently endangered.The reports of the Polish Commissariat to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs often contained descriptions of German attacks on Poles, for example in the town of Piekło; or on Polish students in the town of Pszczółki During Chodacki's service as Commissioner, the work of Polish Intelligence was intensified as employees of the Commissariat collected information about the military preparations in the Free City. Still in August 1939 the Polish Commissioner, according to the accepted custom, paid a visit to the battleship Schleswig-Holstein.Chodacki thus described this moment in his memoirs: It was perhaps the toughest moment of my life, that walk under the barrels of heavy ship cannons, and then a glass of champagne in the accompaniment of those snotty officers' mocking smirks. (Była to chyba najcięższa chwila mojego życia, to przejście dwukrotne pod lufami ciężkich dział okrętowych, a potem kieliszek szampana przy akompaniamencie drwiących uśmieszków smarkatych oficerków.) quoted in: G. Danielewicz W kręgu Polonii gdańskiej Gdańsk 1996, , quoted after: Strona domowa Waldemara Matlana On September 1, 1939, Chodacki, along with other employees of the Polish Commissariat, was arrested by the Germans. As the result of the protests by the already-expelled High Commissioner of the League of Nations in Gdańsk, Carl Jacob Burckhardt, the Germans released Chodacki and others on the border with Lithuania on September 5.  Second World War and aftermath  During World War II, Chodacki was a soldier of the Polish Armed Forces in France and Great Britain. He was consequently transferred to the Polish Consulate in New York City and on September 1, 1943 became the head of the secret branch of Polish Intelligence Estezet. In the years 1944-1945, he was a Polish liaison officer in the rank of major attached to the American Office of Strategic Services. After the war, Chodacki worked at the Józef Piłsudski Institute in New York City, serving as executive director between 1949 and 1951.

Description In its habit Oldenburgia paradoxa is a remarkably dense, usually cushion-shaped, subshrub, typically growing in the form of a hemisphere. A plant sometimes exceeds a metre in height, but usually much less, commonly 30 cm or so. The leaves are elliptical, alternate, and in appearance are typical of the genus, leathery, deep green above, and felted white below. They are suggestive of loquat leaves with the margins slightly rolled down. Young leaves are vividly white-felted all over; as they mature, they shed the felt on the upper surface, but retain the felt on their under- surfaces. Unlike the leaves of other members of the genus, the leaves of Oldenburgia paradoxa are crowded impenetrably closely at the branch tips around the periphery of the plant, and they are much smaller, being some 10 cm long. The branches have thick, corky bark that generally is not visible on an undamaged plant. The flower heads are pedunculate to nearly sessile, but are exceptional among Oldenburgias, being borne among the leaves at the surface of the plant cushion; the other Oldenburgia species have tall peduncles that stand proud of the plant. The flower heads are about 5 cm in diameter, creamy, sometimes with a tinge of pink or purple. The flowerheads are solitary and terminal. Distribution and environment The species is endemic to the mountains of the southern part of the Western Cape Province in South Africa. Its status is not clear; it always was uncommon and persists largely in mountain reserves. It grows in sandstone on cliffs, in rock crevices, and near mountain tops where it has little competition from other plants.

She has spent most of her career at Le Point where she was editor. In 2007, she was appointed adviser to President of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, and in charge of the \\"political center\\" at the Élysée Palace from March 2008. Since 2011 she has headed Public Establishment of the Palace, Museum and National Estate of Versailles that administer the Palace of Versailles. Pégard was awarded Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur in 2012.  Early career  Pégard was born in Le Havre and after high school had her first experience with journalism under the leadership of Roger Campion, the editor of the local Le Havre Libre. After studying history and political science, Pégard began her journalistic career in 1977. From 1978 to 1982, she wrote about politics in Le Quotidien de Paris.  At Le Point  Pégard joined Le Point as a political journalist in 1982. She covered in particular the area of parliamentary news. When Denis Jeambar became editor-in-chief in 1988, as well as editor-in-chief of the political and cultural departments, Pégard became his assistant. After Jeambar left and became general director of Europe 1 in 1995, Pégard took over as editor-in-chief of Le Point. Pégard published a weekly \\"Political notebook\\" in Le Point fed from the backstage of politics. At the same time, she discussed political news on Radio Classique with Jean-Marc Lech. From October 2004, she also co-hosted the show Les Femmes et les Patrons d'abord (\\"The Women and the Patrons First\\") on Paris Première alongside Alexandra Golovanoff.  At the Elysee  Pégard left Le Point in 2007, when she was appointed adviser to President Nicolas Sarkozy. The appointment of a journalist-editor from a major newspaper such as Le Point as advisor to the President sparked controversy. Asked about the issue of relations between the press and politics in France, the reporter John Vinocur from the International Herald Tribune responded in an interview by Renaud Revel in L'Express (31 May 2007): \\"I think that you exaggerate the complicity of the links that in reality exist in all the democracies of the world. Journalists have become the scapegoats of a society at odds with its elites.\\" Independent advisor to the President from May 2007, Pégard in mid-March 2008 became the head of the new \\"political center\\" created by the Presidency, integrating the closest collaborators of the President. She was assisted by Jerome Peyrat, the councilor in charge of the President's relations with Parliament. Catherine Pégard subsequently was responsible for cultural matters at the Elysee.  At Versailles  Pégard was appointed to the presidency of the Public Establishment of the Palace, Museum and National Estate of Versailles by the Cabinet of France on 31 August 2011, and took office on 2 October, succeeding Jean-Jacques Aillagon, who went on pension. The appointment of Pégard was denounced publicly by some heritage professionals, regretting that she lacked experience in the management of cultural administration. In 2013, Pégard endorsed an exhibition with photographs by Ahae, the South Korean businessman Yoo Byung-eun, praising his artistic qualities. Pégard disclosed that the exhibition was on a sponsorship basis, saying \\"The artist himself wanted to rent the Orangerie. But we never communicate the numbers.\\" French Le Monde and British The Times wrote that Ahae gave million (~ million) to Versailles.

The painting is a retrospective; by 1900 the group was breaking up as its members matured. Subject matter and composition Fruit Bowl, Glass and Apples, Paul Cézanne, 1879–80. Oil on canvas. Museum of Modern Art, New York. This is the work that is the centrepiece of Denis's painting. Paul Ranson in Nabi Costume, Paul Serusier, 1890. Oil on canvas. Musée d'Orsay, Paris. In this painting, Maurice Denis has gathered a group of friends, artists and critics to celebrate Paul Cézanne, who is represented by his still life Fruit Bowl, Glass and Apples of 1879–80 on an easel in the centre of the painting. The scene is the shop of the art dealer Ambroise Vollard in the Rue Laffitte. The Cézanne painting had belonged to Paul Gauguin who is thus evoked, despite not being pictured, having left France permanently in 1895 for the South Seas.Paul Gauguin (1848–1903) Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History, Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2014. Retrieved 10 July 2014. Gauguin described the Cézanne as \\"an exceptional pearl, the apple of my eye.\\"Still Life with Fruit Dish Museum of Modern Art, 2014. Retrieved 25 June 2014. Works by Gauguin and Renoir can be seen in the background. Pictured are many of the key figures from the secret brotherhood of the Nabis, for whom Gauguin was the principal mentor.Dempsey, Amy. (2005) Styles, Schools and Movements: The Essential Encyclopaedic Guide to Modern Art. New York: Thames & Hudson, pp. 50–51. Included are the symbolist painter Odilon Redon, the focus of attention on the far left, Paul Sérusier (Nabi instigator) centre talking to Redon, and at the back, left to right, Edouard Vuillard, the critic André Mellerio wearing a top hat, Ambroise Vollard behind the easel, Maurice Denis, Paul Ranson, Ker-Xavier Roussel, Pierre Bonnard with a pipe, and on the far right Marthe Denis, Maurice's wife. Redon is the respected elder figure of the group, set somewhat apart from the rest. It can be inferred from Sérusier's pose that he is explaining to Redon why the Nabis admire Cézanne.Masterpieces from Paris: Homage to Cézanne National Gallery of Australia, 2009. Retrieved 17 June 2014. Over time, Redon had come to be more closely associated with Cézanne than with Symbolist fellow traveller Gustave Moreau.Lucie-Smith, Edward. (1972) Symbolist Art. London: Thames & Hudson, p. 75. Redon's inclusion in the picture is not surprising; Denis was a fan of Redon and once remarked \\"the lesson of Redon is his powerlessness to paint anything which is not representative of a state of soul, which does not express some depth of emotion, which does not translate an interior vision.\\"Lucie-Smith, 1972, p. 78. At 180 cm high x 240 cm wide the painting is almost life size, which serves to increase its visual impact. The composition has strong verticals in the erect poses of the subjects, the easel and the walking stick, against which the brightly coloured rectangle of the framed still life is contrasted. The scene is crowded. Vollard is grasping the easel which is bursting out of the top edge of the painting, and the figures fully occupy the space of the canvas, leaving little room for anything else. Mrs Denis is reduced to peering over Bonnard's shoulder. Contrasting the strong verticals, the heads of the group provide a horizontal rhythm to the work. The conservative black suits belie the avant-garde reputation of the Nabis. Significance A Studio at Les Batignolles, Henri Fantin-Latour, 1870. Musée d'Orsay, Paris. A possible antecedent for Homage to Cézanne. Belinda Thomson described Homage to Cézanne as Denis \\"turning away from the more spectacular, subjective Symbolism of Gauguin and van Gogh towards what he saw as the reassertion of classical values in Cézanne.\\"\\"Denis, Maurice.\\" Belinda Thomson, Grove Art Online, Oxford Art Online, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 18 June 2014. Denis had visited Rome with Gide in 1898 where he had discovered a renewed interest in classicism. He subsequently published articles such as \\"Cézanne\\" in 1907 and \\"De Gauguin et de Van Gogh au classicisme\\" in 1909 which argued that classicism was at the core of French cultural tradition. By doing so, he influenced a new generation of French artists. A possible antecedent for the work is A Studio at Les Batignolles (1870) by Henri Fantin-Latour, which features, amongst others, Édouard Manet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Émile Zola and Claude Monet. Exhibitions Homage to Cézanne was shown at the Salon de la Société nationale des beaux-arts, Paris, 1901, and the Salon de la Libre Esthétique, Brussels, Belgium, 1901. It was not shown again in an exhibition until 1948. Reactions in 1901 were mixed. Denis referred to the work in his diary as \\"that painting, which still makes the public laugh\\".Letter to André Gide in Maurice Denis, Journal, Vol. 1, Paris: La Colombe, 1957, p. 168. History Homage to Cézanne was in the collection of the writer André Gide who donated it to the Musée du Luxembourg in 1928. It then entered three other collections in Paris: the Musée National d'Art Moderne, in 1977, then The Louvre and finally the Musée d'Orsay.

It dates from the 13th century and has been altered little since. It contains furnishings from several centuries, including an unusual medieval baptismal font, decorated with figures and runes. The church belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby.  History and architecture  Barlingbo Church nave The presently visible church was finished c. 1280. It was however preceded by another church, whose foundations have been discovered under the floor of the present one. The oldest parts of Barlingbo Church are the choir and apse. These have been dated to 1225. Following this, the nave was built, and lastly the tower. The church in its entirety dates from the 13th century. The church has three portals, two of which are in Gothic style and one, the oldest, which is still in the Romanesque tradition. The largest of the Gothic portals seems to have been inserted after the walls were built, as it is obviously too large for the façade and the walls have been made thicker around it in order to accommodate it. This portal dates from c. 1300. In the western, tower façade there is a rose window. There are also Gothic windows with still extant stained glass from c. 1280 in the apse and the south façade, one of only a few instances of preserved medieval stained glass in Sweden in situ. Inside, Barlingbo Church is divided by vaults in three sections, length-wise. It is a single-nave church. Its consciously conceived plan has been interpreted as being influenced by Cistercian architecture. The walls are decorated by murals from different times. Oldest of these are a number of purely decorative, grey triangles and crosses, dating perhaps from the earliest construction period. A set of more monumental but likewise purely decorative paintings in the nave and around the east window of the apse date from c. 1280. Later, from the 14th century, are murals in the apse depicting six apostles, unique in their appearance on Gotland. Among the furnishings, the medieval altar (which has probably once housed a relic) has a Baroque top, dated 1683 and with the monogram of King Charles XI of Sweden. The triumphal cross featuring the crucified Jesus is from c. 1240 and is attributed to the anonymous Tingstädemästaren. In the choir, some tombstones from the 13th and 14th centuries are visible, and the pulpit, itself dating from 1673, has been placed on a medieval side altar. The pews and the organ cover are from the 19th century. One of the church bells is from c. 1440 and carries inscriptions evoking Christ, Mary and Saint Dionysius; the latter is believed to have been the patron saint of the church in Catholic times. An unusual item in the church is the baptismal font, dating from the second part of the 12th century and richly decorated with carved figures. It displays figures from the Bible and the symbols of the evangelists. Some of the figures are also marked with runes. The font, carved from a single block of limestone, is not comparable to any other baptismal font on Gotland. Swedish art historian Johnny Roosval (1879–1965) considered it to be one of the finest pieces of art from medieval Sweden. Influences from medieval English art from the time have also have been traced in the font. The church belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies within the Diocese of Visby.  Parsonage  Close to the church lies the old parsonage. It was built in 1902 in a style mixing Gothic Revival with Renaissance Revival architecture. This turn-of-the-century interpretation of Medieval architecture is unique on Gotland.

He was educated at Westminster School and at Lincoln's Inn. In 1804 he married Elizabeth Rose, the illegitimate daughter of Robert Shirley, 7th Earl Ferrers.

It was created by fiction author JC De La Torre with art by Ray Dillon and Franco Cespedes. Dillon created the art and cover to Issue #1 while Cespedes took over art and cover duties from issue two through six. Publication history Star Mage was originally written by De La Torre as a young adult fiction novel called Darien Connors and The Necromancy of Eridu but he decided that the comic medium was the best place for his story. After teaming with artists Ray Dillon and Franco Cespedes, the creative team developed Star Mage into a six issue mini-series. Star Mage #1 was released on April 16, 2014, beginning a run of six issues. Plot synopsis Darien Connors seems like a normal nerdy kid attending Cocoa Beach High. He has a crush on a girl, gets into trouble with bullies and lives a typical normal life – with one exception – his famous astronaut father. His dad, Douglas Connors, is a famous astronaut who was lost on a manned mission to Mars. Bullies hurt Darien by stringing him up on the school flagpole and suddenly Darien manifests strange magical powers. Using the powers, he frees himself and races into the woods, where he is taken up in a spaceship by Arylos. Arylos informs Darien that he Is not from Earth and is a Star Mage – a wizard with strange magical powers called kishpu.Star Mage #1 Darien would later find out that his father Douglas Connors was actually Dalidor the Magnificent and his brother Orasmas Xul Sarrum was the leader of a rebel sect of mages called the Bel Etu. It’s up to Darien, Arylos and his new friends Tirwa, Anthaar, and Unura to stop Orasmas and his secret weapon. Characters =Darien Connors= Darien is the son of King Dalidor and Queen Kaela of Eridu. Raised on Earth by his father after Orasmas’ rebellion, Darien was ignorant in the ways of his sect, the Sarru Kishpu. =Arylos= An 8th scepter Et Lu Star Mage of the Sarru Kishpu, Arylos was tasked by King Thordar and the council to find Dalidor and his family and return them to Eridu. After discovering Darien orphaned on Earth, Arylos is tasked with being his guardian.Star Mage #2 =Orasmas Xul Sarrum= Darien’s brother and leader of a rival sect of Star Mages called the Bel Etu. Orasmas, like Darien, is a 10th level Scepter – the most powerful level of Star Mages and his power enables him to command a large army of wizards bent on the destruction of the Sarru Kishpu and dominion over the universe. =Tirwa= The first school mate Darien meets on Eridu, Tirwa is one of Darien’s closest friends and allies. Her race, the Radeanean has the ability to read minds, thanks to her bunny like appendages. =Anthaar= A Wasparie, Anthaar and Darien are members of the same house, Ebabbar, and are close friends. He is the physically strongest among them as his race are known for their attack spells and ability to defend the realm. =Unura= Another close friend of Darien’s, Unura is the quiet, reserved one of the group – speaking only when it’s of most importance. Her race, the Notrudarians, have the ability to control weather and the elements with their kishpu (magic). Reception Reviews have been positive regarding Star Mage. Comics – The Gathering called Star Mage #1 “a great premise, fantastic art and tonnes of heart, Star Mage #1 is a great book with tonnes of promise.” While Comic Bastard’s Adam Kelly gave Star Mage #1 a 10 out 10. Capeless Crusader called Star Mage “slightly flawed, but overall enjoyable sci-fi/fantasy tale for kids, with a good, relatable lead character.” Unleash The Fan Boy referred to Star Mage #3 as “an awesome story” giving it a 9 out of 10. \\"Star Mage is a sci-fi romp with a heart,\\" said IDW Publishing editor Tom Waltz. \\"Part Ender's Game, part Last Starfighter... heck, even part Star Wars...

September 15, 2011. https://canadianart.ca/features/sarah_anne_johnson-3/ Although she often works in different media, Johnson expresses her frustrations with classical “straight” photography.Gallpen, Britt. 7 Lessons From Sarah Anne Johnson. Canadian Art. October 26, 2013. https://canadianart.ca/features/7-lessons-sarah-anne-johnson/ Retrieved 17 June 2014. In the Canadian Art article “7 Lessons from Sarah Anne Johnson”, she states, “My general interest in photography is showing what something looks like, but also what it feels like [… by] altering the surface or image in any way, I can describe what a space feels like psychologically, what it feels like to be there”. By using several mediums Johnson is able to separate photography and “true” documentary photographic representation by challenging the notion of photography as fact and different type of truths in capturing moments through photography. Pamela Meredith, a senior curator at the TD Bank Group who purchased Johnson's Tree Planting (2005) series for the bank's collection stated she appreciated how Johnson recreated the photographed moment by manipulating our perception and disrupting memory. =Photographic Series= * Wonderlust - Johnson explores sexual intimacy and the manifestations of intimacy where she took on the role of therapist, counselor, and director. By using multimedia alterations, Johnson is able to manipulate the photographs expressing her own feelings and responses. She examines her own feelings about intimacy and challenge what she sees as an enduring taboo around sex. She stated that the viewer's response to this collection reveals as much about them as it does about her work Paterson, David. Why This Defaced Photo is Sexier Than Your Nude Selfie. The Grid. March 20, 2014. http://www.thegridto.com/city/sexuality/why-this-defaced-photo-is-sexier-than- your-nude-selfie/ * Arctic Wonderland - This series was begun during her The Arctic Circle Residency in 2009 with 14 other artists in order to create engagement and raising consciousness about worldly issues focusing on environmental destruction and the sublime of the Arctic. Johnson presents the Arctic as an unspoiled theme park suspended in time while facing ultimate ruin with effects of climate change, colonization and economic exploitation. It is viewed as an exploration of light – “A sensation that has long bewitched Canadian artists” and “Rugged hinterland photography worthy of Group of Seven” Cushman, Robert. National Post. February 4, 2012. * House on Fire - This series explores the dark story of Johnson's grandmother's unwitting participation in CIA-funded brainwashing experiments at the Allan Memorial Institute at McGill University in the mid-1950s. This collection includes altered photographs, small bronze sculptures, and a dollhouse based on her grandmother's traumatic story, fairy tales, myths, and a troubled psyche. * The Galapagos Project - Johnson follows eco-volunteers in the Galapagos in pursuit of the restoration and maintenance of the Galapagos Islands’ ecosystem threatened by invading species.

He also played in twelve Tests for Australia as a loosehead prop. Family and early life Stiles was born in Melbourne, but grew up in Brisbane. He was educated at Gregory Terrace, where he rowed in the first VIII and played rugby for the first XV. Stiles was selected for the Australian Schoolboys side in 1992 and named as captain. In 1993 and 1994, Stiles played in the Queensland Under 21s side and was a fringe player in the Queensland Reds squad. During this time, Stiles played for Souths in the Brisbane club competition. Because of the physical development and technical ability needed to play front row at representative level, his progression to the senior Queensland side took several years. In 1997 he switched clubs to join University where he was made the club captain – a role he held until 2005 when he retired from playing. He captained the Australian Universities team in 1997 and 1998. Rugby career =Queensland= After having been a squad member for nearly five years, Stiles made his senior Queensland starting debut in 1998. He made his Super 12 starting debut for the Reds at Cape Town in 1999, in a match with the Stormers. The Reds managed to finish on top of the table that year for the regular season but squandered their semi-final home advantage and were defeated by the Crusaders who went on to win the 1999 title. Stiles became the first choice at loosehead prop for the Reds in 2001, and remained so for the next five seasons. An injury to Queensland's captain Elton Flatley in 2004 allowed him to assume the captain's role at the Reds. In the last season of his Reds contract in 2005, the 31-year-old Stiles was still playing strongly enough to be the starting loosehead. However, he wasn't offered a new contract and played his final Queensland game against New Zealand A in June 2005, finishing with 93 state caps. =Australia= Stiles was selected in the Wallaby squad for the European tour in 2000. While he did not play any matches, he gained crucial experience training with the team ahead of the 2001 season. The Australians as reigning Rugby World Cup champions would be seriously challenged and Stiles would play a crucial role for the Wallabies in defending their status. In 2001 he was selected in the Australian squad to face the touring British and Irish Lions side. It was the first such visit from the Lions for twelve years. Stiles made his Australian debut in the lead- up to the series, playing in the match against New Zealand Maori. He scored a try in the 41-29 win over the visiting including a number of All Black players. The ARU did not award test caps for the encounter, though, unlike past matches with the Maori. A good performance against the Maori led to his selection for first Lions test at Brisbane. The Australian team lost in a stunning defeat to the British side but the selection panel persevered with the players and Stiles kept his place for the Melbourne test. After a poor start, the Wallabies finished the stronger in the second test to secure a 35-14 win. They then went on to claim the Tom Richards Trophy the next week in the decider at Sydney. In the following month, the Wallabies retained both the Bledisloe Cup and Tri-Nations trophy. The Australians were the dominant force in world rugby. From 2001 to 2002, Stiles was an integral part of the team. Although in good form during the Super 12, he lost his place in the Wallabies squad in 2003 as the Reds finished with a losing record for the season. Coaching In his playing years, Stiles had taken several off-field roles, including Coaching Director of the Queensland Rugby Union in 1995 and 1996, and coaching several first XV school teams. After retiring from playing, he was the head coach of Premier Grade at University of Queensland from 2005 to 2007. He then moved to Japan as the forwards coach of the Kubota Spears for three seasons, before returning to Australia to take up the forwards coaching position at the Western Force. Stiles was at the Force from 2010 to 2013, before linking again with the Queensland Reds as the forwards coach for 2014 season. He was appointed as head coach of Brisbane City for the inaugural season of Australia's National Rugby Championship, winning the competition twice in his first two seasons in 2014 and 2015. Stiles was appointed as co- interim head coach of the Reds alongside Matt O'Connor two games into the 2016 season, after Richard Graham was sacked as head coach. On 26 July 2016, he was named the new head coach of the franchise.

It is also a parish church of the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown. History Demetrius Gallitzin grave St. Michael's parish was founded by the Rev. Demetrius Gallitzin and it was named for the patron saint of Michael McGuire, who was the first settler in the area in 1788. The parish has had four different church buildings in its history. The first church was built of white pine logs in 1799. The second church was a frame structure built in 1817. The first and second church buildings were located in the same location on the western edge of the cemetery. The outline of the stone foundation of the second church can still be seen there. The third church was built of brick in 1854 where the present church is located. Construction for the present church was begun on January 10, 1900. The stone for the foundation was quarried locally. The church was consecrated on October 2, 1901. The Romanesque Revival church was built at a cost of $150,000. It was designed by Frederick J. Osterling, and paid for by Charles M. Schwab, the president of United States Steel, who had spent his youth in Loretto. The three bells in the tower were donated by Mr. and Mrs. Charles Schwab, Mr. and Mrs. John Schwab and the Rev. Ferdinand Kittell, who was the pastor when the church was built. Andrew Carnegie donated the pipe organ for $8,000. Pope John Paul II decreed on September 9, 1996 that St. Michael's Church was elevated to the status of a minor basilica. Basilica's interior Architecture While the church was substantially designed in the Romanesque Revival style, there are some decorative elements in the Gothic Revival style. These include the altars, that were carved of Carrara marble and imported from Italy, and the altar rail that is composed of Mexican onyx and supported by brass pilasters, capitals and panels. The Stations of the Cross were also imported from Italy. The interior features three paintings over the Main Altar area. They were created by an artist from Chicago and depict the Ascension of Jesus, the Flight into Egypt, and the Nativity of Jesus. The wainscoting and the pews are both composed of red oak.

(2014). Encyclopedia of American Radio, 1920–1960, 2nd Edition, Volume 1. McFarland & Company, Inc.; . p. 250. and on Top of the Evening, which debuted in 1944. In the early 1950s, Sweetland's backing vocals were featured on several early sessions by the young Tony Bennett, and she also took part in numerous children's records. In 1953, Sweetland's duet with Eddie Fisher on the song \\"I'm Walking Behind You\\" reached number one on both the Billboard Top 100 and the UK Singles Chart. Sweetland later worked as a vocal coach with her husband Lee, a baritone, who was Woody Woodpecker's singing voice on NBC radio. Among their students was Seth MacFarlane, creator of Family Guy. Personal life Sweetland was born in Los Angeles. She celebrated her 100th birthday in 2011, citing laughter as her secret to longevity. She was widowed in 2009 and, as of 2013, was a resident of Banning, California. She died at her home there, on February 8, 2015, aged 103.

That is, if there exists a collection of planar graphs, all having the same set of vertices, such that the union of these planar graphs is , then the thickness of is at most ... In other words, the thickness of a graph is the minimum number of planar subgraphs whose union equals to graph .Christian A. Duncan, On Graph Thickness, Geometric Thickness, and Separator Theorems, CCCG 2009, Vancouver, BC, August 17–19, 2009 Thus, a planar graph has thickness 1. Graphs of thickness 2 are called biplanar graphs. The concept of thickness originates in the 1962 conjecture of Frank Harary: For any graph on 9 points, either itself or its complementary graph is non-planar. The problem is equivalent to determining whether the complete graph is biplanar (it is not, and the conjecture is true). A comprehensive survey on the state of the arts of the topic as of 1998 was written by Petra Mutzel, Thomas Odenthal and Mark Scharbrodt.Petra Mutzel, Thomas Odenthal and Mark Scharbrodt, The Thickness of Graphs: A Survey Specific graphs The thickness of the complete graph on vertices, , is :\\\\left \\\\lfloor \\\\frac{n+7}{6} \\\\right\\\\rfloor, except when for which the thickness is three., Theorem 3.2.. With some exceptions, the thickness of a complete bipartite graph is generally:, Theorem 3.4.. :\\\\left \\\\lceil \\\\frac{ab}{2(a+b-2)} \\\\right \\\\rceil. Related problems Every forest is planar, and every planar graph can be partitioned into at most three forests. Therefore, the thickness of any graph is at most equal to the arboricity of the same graph (the minimum number of forests into which it can be partitioned) and at least equal to the arboricity divided by three.. The thickness of is also within constant factors of another standard graph invariant, the degeneracy, defined as the maximum, over subgraphs of , of the minimum degree within the subgraph. If an -vertex graph has thickness t then it necessarily has at most edges, from which it follows that its degeneracy is at most . In the other direction, if a graph has degeneracy then it has arboricity, and thickness, at most . Thickness is closely related to the problem of simultaneous embedding.. If two or more planar graphs all share the same vertex set, then it is possible to embed all these graphs in the plane, with the edges drawn as curves, so that each vertex has the same position in all the different drawings. However, it may not be possible to construct such a drawing while keeping the edges drawn as straight line segments. A different graph invariant, the rectilinear thickness or geometric thickness of a graph , counts the smallest number of planar graphs into which can be decomposed subject to the restriction that all of these graphs can be drawn simultaneously with straight edges. The book thickness adds an additional restriction, that all of the vertices be drawn in convex position, forming a circular layout of the graph. However, in contrast to the situation for arboricity and degeneracy, no two of these three thickness parameters are always within a constant factor of each other.. Computational complexity It is NP-hard to compute the thickness of a given graph, and NP-complete to test whether the thickness is at most two.. However, the connection to arboricity allows the thickness to be approximated to within an approximation ratio of 3 in polynomial time.

Awareness of this disease is very important in the region of the Americas, where an estimated 120 million people in 21 endemic countries are at risk of malaria. In 2012, there were 469,000 confirmed malaria cases in the region with 108 deaths. Nonetheless, declining incidence of disease and malaria- related mortality has led to low prioritization of malaria on national health agendas in the Americas. Guyana has recognized this day since 2003, commemorating the day that Nobel Prize winner, Dr. Charles Laveran first observed the malaria parasite in blood. This date was recommended by Guyana to be the official date for the region, which is now celebrated by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and Member States since 2007. This day is a mechanism for countries in Latin America and the Caribbean to engage stakeholders in the fight against malaria. Ministries of Health and other actors, such as international donors and technical partners of Amazon Malaria Initiative, are encouraged to hold local outreach events on November 6 in order to achieve critical mass and raise awareness of the issue of malaria prevention and control, which have included events in Guyana and Belize.  History  Malaria Day in the Americas was envisioned by the 46th Directing Council of the Pan American Health Organization in 2005 and established in October 2007 by the 27th Pan American Sanitary Conference held in Washington, DC. November 6 was proposed by Member State Guyana and approved as it coincides with the day Charles Louise Alphonse first observed the presence of malaria parasites in the blood of patients Malaria Day in the Americas is a separate event from World Malaria Day, which was established the same year and is marked by the World Health Organization on April 25. Following the 2013 Malaria Day in the Americas, participating countries were encouraged to engage in a year-round campaign against the disease to attain the following objectives: # Improve the communication process and extension of advocacy work to all stakeholders and target audiences. # Enhance visibility/interest on Malaria in the Region of Americas and the global scourge that the disease brings to peoples of the world. # Increase awareness and understanding of the key issues among target audience/population. # Catalyze change of attitudes and modification of behaviors. # Generate advocacy/support from the public, policy makers, clients and strategic partners. # Encourage increased and enduring support to efforts against malaria, including the elimination of local transmission in areas where such is feasible. Malaria Champions of the Americas Through the annual Malaria Champion of the Americas competition, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the United Nations Foundation, the George Washington University Milken Institute School of Public Health (MISPH), and the Johns Hopkins University School of Public Health's Center for Communication Programs (JHU-CCP) (the PAHO Foundation was a previous sponsor of this Forum) seek to recognize organizations and initiatives in the region of the Americas that exemplify best practices and success stories in malaria prevention and control. The jury selects three finalists from among all nominated organizations, and then uses pre-determined criteria to award one “Malaria Champion of the Americas” for having made the most significant contributions to malaria prevention and control in the region of the Americas during that year. An awards ceremony is held at PAHO headquarters in Washington, DC on November 6, or on an alternate date when the sixth falls on a Friday or weekend. The Malaria Champions of the Americas awards ceremony is webcast live to encourage virtual participation throughout the region. The 2013 Malaria Day in the Americas was celebrated on November 6 at PAHO headquarters in Washington DC, on that day, the Colombia Malaria Project was honored as Malaria Champion of the Americas 2013. There was special recognition given to the malaria program of the Dominican Republic for its efforts in cross-border coordination with Haiti, as well as to the State Health Department of Acre, Brazil for its sustained excellence in malaria control. The 2014 Malaria Day in the Americas event focused on Accelerating the Elimination of Malaria. The 2014 Malaria Champion of the Americas was the Centro Nacional Para el Control de las Enfermedades Tropicales (CENCET) from the Dominican Republic The 2015 Malaria Day in the Americas forum was held on November 5, 2015 at PAHO/WHO Headquarters in Washington, DC and featured videos, presentations, and discussions on Malaria Networks and Advocates, the regional launch of Roll Back Malaria's Action and Investment to Defeat Malaria (AIM) 2016 - 2030, and the work of ‘Malaria Champions of the Americas 2015.’ The finalists included the National Malaria Control Program of Brazil, the Honduras Ministry of Health Health Surveillance Unit, and the National Malaria Eradication Service (SENEPA) of Paraguay. The National Malaria Control Program from Brazil won the overall prize as the 2015 Malaria Champion of the Americas. The 2016 Malaria Day in the Americas forum was held on November 3, 2016 at the PAHO/WHO Headquarters in Washington, DC and featured videos, presentations, and discussions around the theme \\"End Malaria for Good.\\" The three countries recognized this year as \\"Malaria Champions of the Americas 2016\\", included Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Suriname.

This has continued as an exercise system into the 21st century. Education After an education at Alexandra School and Alexandra College, Dublin, she enrolled in 1907 as a trainee teacher at Mrs Josef Conn's Institute of Physical Training in London. She had met Mrs Conn in Paris and was inspired by her specialisation in exercises to promote health. By 1910 she had moved to Manchester and set up her own fitness centre with private classes, large classes for women factory workers and also treated private patients. Development of the Bagot Stack Exercise System In the 1920s she again began to hold classes, initially for children in her own home, and by 1926 was training teachers in her own system at the Bagot Stack Health School in Holland Park, London. This initially involved 12 sequences of exercise designed to train the body in accordance with the seven principles of the Bagot Stack System. There were classes for women and children in dance as well as exercises. Her inspiration for developing her own exercise system came from a short time in India, where she observed the differences in movement between women wearing constricting Europeans clothes and those with looser Indian clothing. She had also studied hatha yoga on her travels in India. She developed a series of exercises based around her belief that movement was essential in life. This also fitted with ideas developing across Europe at the time of the benefits to women of exercise and changes in clothes fashions. As well as involving vigorous group exercises, the classes were designed to be sociable, which benefited the many recently bereaved women. Mass market Her big innovation was to move from small, private classes to a mass-market movement. In 1930 this grew into a commercial enterprise, the Women's League of Health and Beauty, using the YMCA's Regent Street premises. Public displays in London garnered publicity, and more centres started in 1932 in Bromley, Southend, Slough, Bournemouth, Croydon, Birmingham, Glasgow followed by Ayr, Paisley and Edinburgh and finally franchised centres all over the UK. The Women's League of Health and Beauty classes included elements from dance, callisthenics, and remedial, slimming, and rhythmical exercise to music. The League published its own magazine, Mother and Daughter, from 1933 to 1935 with content on pacifism and feminist political discussion as well as general self- improvement. Her book Building the Body Beautiful - The Bagot Stack stretch- and-swing system was published in 1931. The organisation has been described as the most popular female physical culture organization in Britain. The league adapted eugenicist terms and saw women as \\"natural race builders\\".Zweiniger‐Bargielowska, Ina. (2005). The Culture of the Abdomen: Obesity and Reducing in Britain, circa 1900–1939. Journal of British Studies 44 (2): 239-273. Their aim was to promote \\"racial health\\" through physical exercise.Garrity, Jane. (2003). Step-daughters of England: British Women Modernists and the National Imaginary. Manchester University Press. p. 67. The organisation grew rapidly so that by 1934 there were 47,000 members but this had grown to 166,000 in 1937. Her daughter Prunella, along with others, continued promoting this exercise system so that what is now called the \\"Flexercise\\" movement continues as a national fitness programme in the UK.

The Mosque was built in the 18th-century and named after Luar Batang, in accordance with the nickname of a sacred guardian of Islam, Habib Luar Batang, where his shrine is also located. History Habib Husein bin Abu Bakr bin Abdillah al-Aydarus was born in Mighab near Hazam in Hadhramaut, but migrated to Batavia when he was relatively young at around 20 years old to preach Islam. There is story saying that he stopped by in Gujarat on his route to Nusantara. He landed in area called Kampung Luar Batang when the area was under control of Dutch East India Company (VOC). Habib Husein became increasingly popular and many people began to flock to his place to live. This has led to the suspicion of local authorities. So, Hussein and his family were arrested and imprisoned in a separate room in Glodok. According to the local urban legend, at every prayer time Habib Husein always seemed to be the Imam in a large holding room, but at the same time the prison officers saw him also was sleeping in his locked cell. On the basis of this miracle, then Habib Husein was released. Habib Husein died on 27th of Ramadhan 1169 AH or on Tuesday June 24, 1756 and buried inside the mosque complex. Habib Husein is a Sayyid of Ba 'Alawi sada family. His full name is Husein bin Abubakar bin Abdullah bin Husein bin Ali bin Muhammad bin Ahmad bin Husein bin Abdullah bin Abubakar Al-Sakran bin Abdurrahman Assaqqaf bin Muhammad Maula Al-Dawilah bin Ali bin Alwi bin Muhammad al-Faqih al-Muqaddam bin Ali bin Muhammad Shahib Mirbath. In 1791 a Chinese explorer, named Ong Hoe Hoe lingered in Batavia and wrote about a prominent Chinese among the Chinese who had long lived in Luar Batang. In Ong Hoe Hoe's report written around 1793 and translated into Dutch in 1852, he mentioned about a sage in Luar Batang. \\"Nek Bok Seng once lived in a wooden hut made of banana tree in a place called the shrine. He lived alone and busied himself with reading and writing books. He loved playing flute, poetry and playing chess cleverly. He was a wise and intelligent man. On Sunday the house was full of friends. He was as excited as our famous man Pok Hoe, respected for the way he entertained people ... Daze and kind of the bong Seng like Chrysanthemums while in his heart it occurred very beautiful. Actually, he may be called and regarded as a wise man of our century \\" There is no clear explanation whether the person Nek Bok Seng as described is actually Habib Husain. As recorded on the mosque door in 1916, the building was completed on 20 Muharram 1152 AH coincides with the 29 April 1739 CE. The Qibla direction on this mosque was not precise so it was corrected by Muhammad Arshad al- Banjari (d. 1812 CE) during a stopover on his way home from the Hejaz to Banjar in 1827 CE. The orientation of the mosque is not really directed to Kaaba, similar to Kebon Sirih dan Cikini mosques. Therefore, there are scholars such as Abubakar Atjeh who assume that the original space of the mosque was used as a former residence of the person (Habib Husein) who later used it as musolla or mosque. The Newspaper Bataviaasche Courant on May 12, 1827 also mentioned it in the essay about the Luar Batang Mosque. As noted in this newspaper, Habib Husein died approximately in 1796, after a long preaching journey between Surabaya and Batavia. In 1812 his grave was signed with some stones and still located outside the mosque until 1827 CE. Apparently, at that time charity was no longer given to the commander (a sort of headman) of Luar Batang village, but instead given directly to the mosque committee so the building could be expanded. The newspaper also mentioned that the Sacred Luar Batang Shrine is famous in Batavia. Habib Husein died inside home of Commander Abdul Raup and buried beside an existing mosque. Muhammad Lebe and Abdul Hamid Malik requested to beautify the tomb of Habib Husein, and were granted permission in 1812. People then began to believe that each vow spoken near the tomb is always fulfilled. People requested the mosque committee to often present black goat and its horns decorated with gold cover. =Kampung Luar Batang= One version of the story why he is so called Habib Luar Batang tells that when Habib Husein died and en route to be buried in the Batavia suburb around Tanah Abang, his body suddenly was not in the coffin. The phenomena lasted up to three times of their attempts. Finally, the congregation then agreed to bury him in the current location instead and the location was then called Luar Batang (Luar, outside; and Batang, body in Betawi language) means a body outside (a coffin). Since then, the late habib was called Habib Luar Batang. Another story version which makes more sense is that not long after VOC was founded, the VOC authorities started a surveillance on boats entering the Sunda Kelapa harbor, especially perahus belonged to indigenous people. To block the perahus, the VOC authority applied a long wooden beam (which is literally translated to Batang (trunk) in the local language). These perahus could not enter the port and had to wait for days outside the post until the 'batang' lifted, so the local people called the perahus were in \\"Luar Batang\\" (Outside the beam). While waiting, many of the crew went ashore. Later they set up temporary huts and became a village. Initially, the village was like an island because it frequently flooded due to the tide water. In around 1660, VOC brought fishermen from East Java. These fishermen were placed in the village which then was called Kampung Luar Batang or Luar Batang Village. The leader of this fishermen named Bagus Karta was given the honorary rank of lieutenant in 1677. Residential location \\"Luar Batang\\" had been a swamp, but soon the swamp silted with mud from Ciliwung river. In 1739, the VOC Governor General gave a small piece of land on the western side of Ciliwung River across Sunda Kelapa port to Habib Husein. According to local folklore, Habib Husein had karomah (supernatural power) and was influential in spreading and leading Muslims on the northern area of Batavia. The shrine and mosque is located in approximately 14 hectares area of Kampung Luar Batang, about 3 km from Pekojan. The mosque, considered keramat (sacred) to many people, is one of the cultural heritage of Jakarta, overlooking the port of Sunda Kelapa and is one of the attractions to visitors coming to Old Jakarta. =Luar Batang Affair= In around 1870s began an affair what was then called Perkara Luar Batang, which is an affair related to the large amounts of charity income the mosque received. At first, two commanders of Luar Batang tried to get the charity, but were hindered by the fatwas of various scholars, notably by the fatwa issued by Habib Usman bin Yahya, who confirmed that Habib Husein's descendants were eligible for the charity. The fatwa was justified by Ahmad Dahlan, a Mufti of Shafi'i in Mecca in 1878 CE. Since the decision was made, it triggered family quarrel among the Arabs. On the advice of Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, the mosque courtyard was then closed by the Dutch government until they reach a deal. The resolution process went quickly, and the Luar Batang Affair ended in 1905. Structure At the entrance to the complex there is a big white Gapura (gate) which was originally in Javanese Hindu architecture. The mosque structure is square in shape. Inside, the mosque has two large halls, inside hall and outside hall. Each hall has 12 poles, which added up to 24. The number of poles indicating the number of hours in a day, 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of night. Besides the outside hall, there is a room which is the location of the tomb of Habib Husein and his student, Haji Abdul Kadir. There has been a few renovations performed, so many of the structure and ornaments are no longer the same as the original, See also * Masjid Luar Batang * Timeline of Islamic history * Islamic architecture * Islamic art * List of mosques in Asia * List of the oldest mosques in the world * List of mosques * Islam in Indonesia References * * Category:Mosques in Jakarta Category:18th-century mosques Category:1739 establishments in the Dutch Empire Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1739 ","title":"Luar Batang Mosque"},{"id":"43082808","text":"Dirk Keetbaas Jr. (June 20, 1921 - July 27, 1995) was a Dutch-born flautist, composer, and record producer in Canada. He became known as a member of the Symphony Six, a group of six musicians under contract to the Toronto Symphony Orchestra who were denied entry to the United States for a concert tour under suspicion of leftist activities. Early life Dirk Keetbaas Jr. was born in Scheveningen, the Netherlands, to Dirk Keetbaas Sr. (1895-1988), who later became a violist and conductor in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Career From 1940 to 1945 Keetbaas played with the Central Band of the Royal Canadian Air Force in Ottawa. From 1946 to 1953, he performed in various chamber groups in Toronto, as well as played with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra and the CBC Symphony Orchestra. In November 1951 the Toronto Symphony Orchestra was invited to participate in the \\"Major Symphony Series\\" in Detroit, its first appearance in the United States, alongside major US orchestras from Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and Philadelphia. In keeping with US immigration laws, the orchestra submitted its list of members for clearance. Seven musicians were not given clearance; this was later pared down to six: Keetbaas, William Kuinka, Abe Mannheim, John Moskalyk, Ruth Budd, and Steven Staryk (later known as the Symphony Six), who were denied access to the United States under suspicion of leftist activities. The performers had associated openly with communist or communist front organizations in the vein of artistic collaboration, but denied the charges of political involvement. At the end of the season the orchestra did not renew its contracts with these musicians. This created a controversy in Canada. Keetbaas went on to become the principal flautist for the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra and the CBC Winnipeg Orchestra from 1953 to 1968. From 1956 to 1966 he directed and performed with the Dirk Keetbaas Players, a wind quintet featuring flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, and French horn. Keetbaas composed a Quintet for Winds in 1961 and the orchestral overture Woodhaven in 1965. Keetbaas was the flautist in Five Improvisations and composer-flautist in Three Miniatures for Solo Flute, Music and Musicians of Canada III and E.gré plays E.gré. In 1968, Keetbaas began producing records for the new CBC Records label and also taught music. He moved to Calgary, Alberta in 1985 and continued teaching composition to private students. Personal Around 1935, he married Mary Persoage (1919-2011) in Toronto. They had one son. He died in Calgary on July 27, 1995, at age of 74. He had donated his music collection to the University of Manitoba.

There is no general consensus on part of Maoist–Third Worldists as a whole. However, the majority of proponents typically argue for the centrality of anti-imperialism to the victory of global communist revolution as well as against the idea that the working class in the First World is majority- exploited (sometimes arguing that it experiences no exploitation at all) and therefore it is not a part of the international proletariat. In academic discourse, Maoism–Third Worldism is sometimes synonymous with dependency theory or dependencism.  Theory  Maoism–Third Worldism is theoretically defined by a variety of political principles which emphasize the enormous economic, social and political divisions which exist currently between the \\"overdeveloped\\" First World and the \\"underdeveloped\\" Third World. This is expressed through the lens of Maoist theory and practice, but brought into a new international understanding of imperialism and class in the context of the world which has been divided into two distinct camps, namely the exploited countries (the Third World) and their exploiters (the First World). According to the Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement (RAIM), on the question of the principal theoretical observations of Maoism–Third Worldism they state: > Confronted by a complacent working class, served by an opportunist left, and > alienated from the proletariat through the reception of surplus value > drained from the Third World, we must understand the ideological and > strategic implications of struggle from within the parasitic core. It > benefits neither the left in the oppressor or the oppressed nations to > pretend that the condition of the working class around the world is the > same... To be a Third Worldist, in our view, is to be a principled > internationalist. = Global people's war = However, the foundations of Maoism–Third Worldism extend to encapsulate a great many strategic and theoretical developments in Marxist theory over the 20th century. Among them is the understanding of a global people's war being necessary as a military strategy for bringing an end to the historically unequal relationship built between the First and Third Worlds. This strategy includes the systematic delinking of the exploited economies of Third World countries from the parasitic First World and the unification of international forces to deprive the imperialist countries of resources and wealth extracted from Third World countries. Though this strategy has been drawn from several historical sources such as Che Guevara's Message to the Tri-Continental, it has most famously drawn on a quote from Lin Biao's speech Long Live the Victory of People's War! in 1965: > Taking the entire globe, if North America and Western Europe can be called > 'the cities of the world', then Asia, Africa and Latin America constitute > 'the rural areas of the world'. Since World War II, the proletarian > revolutionary movement has for various reasons been temporarily held back in > the North American and West European capitalist countries, while the > people’s revolutionary movement in Asia, Africa and Latin America has been > growing vigorously. In a sense, the contemporary world revolution also > presents a picture of the encirclement of cities by the rural areas. In the > final analysis, the whole cause of world revolution hinges on the > revolutionary struggles of the Asian, African and Latin American peoples who > make up the overwhelming majority of the world’s population. The socialist > countries should regard it as their internationalist duty to support the > people’s revolutionary struggles in Asia, Africa and Latin America. = Joint-dictatorship of the proletariat of oppressed nations = Also fundamental to Maoism–Third Worldism is an understanding of the joint- dictatorship of the proletariat of oppressed nations (JDPON) and/or global new democratic revolution (GNDR) which is proposed as a form of alter- globalization aimed at breaking the political and economic foundations of the economic parasitism between the First and Third Worlds. The JDPON is a point of relative contention between the various proponents of Maoism–Third Worldism or at least the tendencies which have now been named as falling generally under the Third Worldist tendency within Marxism. In their cardinal principles, the Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement (RAIM), describes the JDPON as such: > The necessary political strategy for world revolution to accompany the GPPW > must result in the establishment of a Joint-Dictatorship of the Proletariat > of Oppressed Nations (JDPON). Throughout the history of world imperialism > there has been a massive accumulation of wealth in the core imperialist > countries of the First World. We understand that to move forward in the hope > of Communism without reconciling the vast division of wealth and labor > between the First and Third Worlds can only produce social imperialism; > Communism cannot be built over the hoards of stolen wealth in the core, to > advance this contradiction must be resolved. To resolve this, and to sew > together those movements who should coalesce in the global strategy of > Global Protracted People’s War, we must have a Global New Democratic > Revolution, in which a coalition toward the alter-globalization of the world > is formed from the cooperation of the Proletarian and Progressive states of > the oppressed countries, under the leadership of the Proletariat, to guide > the revolutionary forces toward the defeat of imperialism. As well, to > promote revolutionary consciousness and catalyze the development toward the > JDPON: the global settling of accounts through which the means of production > of the core countries are internationalized and their wealth is > redistributed to those countries which have been historically robbed. It is > through this process of JDPON that the contradiction between > oppressor/oppressed nations is resolved and the oppressor countries are > integrated into the world socialist project. However, the concept of the JDPON has also existed for quite a while longer than the RAIM and was first formalized in its contemporary form by the Maoist Internationalist Movement (MIM) in their article on the dictatorship of the proletariat: > Because there is no exploited white working class in North Amerika, MIM > favors the joint dictatorship of the proletariat of the oppressed nations > (JDPON). This amounts to putting u.$. imperialism into receivership by > something like a proletarian United Nations. The whole dictatorship of the > proletariat idea or its current form required as JDPON is a strategy for > advance from capitalism toward communism, in which dictatorship is only a > stage existing until certain tasks eliminating classes are done.  Organisations  The Maoism–Third Worldism movement is currently mostly associated with organizations such as the Revolutionary Anti-Imperialist Movement and Maoist Internationalist Ministry of Prisons, a branch-off from the Maoist Internationalist Movement (MIM), a now defunct organisation). However, MIM Prisons considers its ideology to be MIM Thought and not Maoist–Third Worldist. ANTICONQUISTA, an anti-imperialist media collective, upholds Third Worldist views.

New England has one of the United States' oldest intercity transportation systems, which remain important to the region's economy. It is also home to the continent's first subway system. The densely populated area has many cities and towns connected by rail and road, and the larger cities each have commercial airports with daily flights to destinations outside of the region. Transportation Public transportation is an essential part of daily life in Greater Boston. Over 1.3 million people ride the MBTA daily, making it one of the busiest transit systems in the U.S. The MBTA Commuter Rail serves Eastern Massachusetts and parts of Rhode Island radiating from Downtown Boston, with planned service to New Hampshire. The CTrail system operates the Shoreline East and Hartford Lines, covering Coastal Connecticut, Hartford, and Springfield, Massachusetts Amtrak's Northeast Corridor connects southern New England to the Mid-Atlantic. Together, with Acela service, is the busiest rail corridor in the U.S. =Rail= The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) provides rail and subway service within the Boston metropolitan area, bus service in Greater Boston, and commuter rail service throughout eastern Massachusetts and parts of Rhode Island. The New York City Metropolitan Transportation Authority's Metro-North Railroad provides commuter rail service in southwestern Connecticut, while the Connecticut Department of Transportation operates the Shore Line East commuter rail service along the Connecticut coastline east of New Haven, and the Hartford Line northward to Springfield, Massachusetts. On a trial basis until Fall of 2021, Amtrak is working with CTrail to provide service north of its route from Springfield, through the Valley Flyer route to Greenfield. Amtrak provides interstate rail service throughout New England. Boston is the northern terminus of the Northeast Corridor line. The Vermonter connects Vermont to Massachusetts and Connecticut, while the Downeaster links Maine to Boston. =Air= The largest and busiest airport in New England is Logan International Airport in Boston, which has many daily flights to domestic and international destinations. Logan has two nearby regional airports considered to be reliever airports, T.F. Green Airport in Warwick, Rhode Island, and Manchester Boston Regional Airport in Manchester, New Hampshire. Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, is the region's second busiest airport. Other commercial airports include Portland International Jetport, Bangor International Airport, Worcester Regional Airport, and Burlington International Airport. =Interstate Highways= Six mainline Interstate highways traverse New England. Interstate highways ending in an even number run east-west; those ending in odd numbers run north-south. At least one serves each state and its respective capital city: 20px Interstate 84 enters New England at Danbury, Connecticut, and crosses that state to the northeast, connecting the cities of Waterbury and the state capital of Hartford before terminating at a junction with Interstate 90 in Massachusetts. 20px Interstate 90 carries the Massachusetts Turnpike designation as it crosses the state. I-90 enters Massachusetts at West Stockbridge and travels eastward to its terminus in the state's capital and New England's largest city, Boston. It connects the major cities of Springfield and Worcester and intersects with many of New England's major north-south routes. 20px Interstate 89 begins at a junction with Interstate 93 just south of New Hampshire's state capital, Concord. It then travels northwesterly until it reaches Lebanon, after which it crosses the Connecticut River and enters Vermont at White River Junction. I-89 continues its northwesterly path to Vermont's state capital of Montpelier; then continues west to Vermont's largest city, Burlington; and finally turns due north along the east shore of Lake Champlain and ends at the international border with Québec, Canada. 20px Interstate 91 begins in New Haven, Connecticut, at a junction with Interstate 95, running north from there through Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Vermont until it reaches the Canada–US border. I-91 parallels U.S. Route 5 for its entire length, and much of the route also follows the Connecticut River, linking many of the major cities and towns along the river, including state capital Hartford; Springfield, Massachusetts; and Brattleboro, Vermont. I-91 is the only Interstate route within New England that intersects five of the others. Since I-91 runs north-south along the Connecticut River from the Vermont side in lieu of New Hampshire's, the highway does not traverse the states of Rhode Island, New Hampshire, or Maine. 20px Interstate 93 begins in Canton, Massachusetts, at a junction with Interstate 95, running northwestward from there through the city of Boston. I-93 travels northwesterly from Boston and into New Hampshire, where it serves as the main interstate highway through that state and links many of the larger cities and towns, including Derry; Manchester, the largest city north of Boston; and the state capital, Concord. From there I-93 turns into a generally northerly direction and connects with highways in the state's famed lakes region and then onto its popular White Mountains region, noted for skiing and beautiful autumn foliage. I-93 continues into New Hampshire's far north and eventually crosses the Connecticut River into Vermont and reaches its northern terminus at a junction with Interstate 91 at St. Johnsbury. 20px Interstate 95, which runs along the East Coast, enters New England at Greenwich, Connecticut, and runs in a generally northeasterly direction along the Atlantic Ocean, eventually heading through Maine's sparsely populated north country to its northern terminus at the Canada–US border with New Brunswick. I-95 serves many of the coastline's cities, including the state capitals of Providence, Rhode Island, and Augusta, Maine, while serving as a partial beltway around Boston. I-95 travels through every New England state except Vermont and is the only two-digit Interstate highway to enter the states of Rhode Island and Maine. It connects most of Connecticut's largest cities except for Hartford and Waterbury and traverses through or near some quaint cities and towns in northern New England including Hampton and Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Portland and Bangor, Maine. =US Routes= *US Route 1 *US Route 2 *US Route 3 *US Route 4 *US Route 5 *US Route 6 *US Route 7 *US Route 20 *US Route 44 *US Route 201 *US Route 202 *US Route 302 References ","title":"Transportation in New England"},{"id":"43082832","text":"John Hughes (22 November 1873 - 14 May 1932) was a Welsh composer of hymn tunes.

It is a \\"Sunday brigade\\", meaning that they were a brigade for the common people who had their drills on Sundays. They still have their drills and practises on Sundays and the brigade has tight bonds to the urban district Laksevåg. Their uniforms are distinct with white shirts and no coats or jackets. Except for the foundation day, Midsummer is a big day for the archers. They have in many generations built a large barrel fire in Kirkebukten at Laksevåg. The works starts in the end of May and lasts until the lighting of the fire. The tallest of the fires have reached almost 30 meters. History Laksevågs Bueskyttere was founded May 8, 1894. Petter Bøthun and Olaf Nygaard are considered to be the founders of the brigade which took place in Dr. Høygaard's garden, between the old fire station and Laxevaag Maskin & Jernskipsbyggeri. Olaf Nygaard became the first Chief Commander of the brigade. Others who took part in the foundation were Rasmus Nygård, Nicolai Thorsen, Gustav Ellingsen and Alfred Andersen. Laksevågs Bueskyttere's uniform was white shirts, black trousers with scarfs and Scot Hats (for the officers), although they rarely could afford such hats. Given that the population at Laksevåg in the late 1800s were very poor, the boys in the brigade could not afford coats or jackets of any kind as the other brigades could. Some even used flour sacks from local bakeries as shirts. The brigade uses crossbow (bow), wooden shield and axe, spear, halberd, épée, saber and snare drum as their \\"weapons\\" and equipment.

Description  The genus Luteostriata is characterized by the presence of a cephalic retractor muscle, which allows those animals to pull their anterior end upwards and backwards. Associated to the muscle are cephalic glands, forming a so-called cephalic musculo-glandular organ in a way similar to the one found in the genera Choeradoplana and Issoca. The copulatory apparatus has an eversible penis, i.e., there is no permanent penis papilla and the penis is formed during copulation by folds in the male cavity which are pushed outwards. Externally, species in this genus usually have a yellow to light brown dorsal color with a series of longitudinal dark stripes, hence the name Luteostriata, from Latin luteus (saffron yellow) + striatus (striped). The anterior end is also usually marked by an orange tinge that posteriorly gradually fades into the yellow color of the dorsum.  Species  There are ten described species in the genus Luteostriata: *Luteostriata abundans (von Graff, 1899) *Luteostriata arturi (Lemos & Leal-Zanchet, 2008) *Luteostriata caissara (Froehlich, 1954) *Luteostriata ceciliae (Froehlich & Leal-Zanchet, 2003) *Luteostriata ernesti (Leal-Zanchet & Froehlich, 2006) *Luteostriata fita (Froehlich, 1959) *Luteostriata graffi (Leal-Zanchet & Froehlich, 2006) *Luteostriata muelleri (Diesing, 1861) *Luteostriata pseudoceciliae (Lemos & Leal-Zanchet, 2008) *Luteostriata subtilis Boll, Amaral & Leal-Zanchet, 2019  Taxonomic history  Dorsal color pattern of all currently described species of Luteostriata The first species of Luteostriata was described in 1857 by Max Schultze and Fritz Müller as a Brazilian yellow planarian with a broad black longitudinal stripe in the middle of the back and a narrow deep orange stripe on each side of it. They identified it as Planaria elegans, a species described by Darwin, and put it in their new genus Geoplana. Later, in 1861, Karl Moriz Diesing noticed that the description of Schultze and Müller's species did not match with that of Darwin's and renamed it Geoplana mülleri. In 1899, Ludwig von Graff published his famous monography on land planarians and described some specimens of yellow land planarians with five or seven black stripes that were sent to him from Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. He identified them as Geoplana marginata, a species described by Schultze and Müller in the same publication in which they misidentified Geoplana elegans. Graff ended up making a similar mistake, as Schultze and Müller's Geoplana marginata was a black species with yellow stripes while Graff's was yellow with black stripes. Specimens with seven stripes instead of only five were considered a variety of Geoplana marginata and named Geoplana marginata var. abundans because of the \\"abundant\\" number of stripes. In the following decades, several authors, such as Albert Riester and Ernst Marcus, continued to identify most Brazilian yellow planarians with 5 or 7 dark longitudinal stripes as Geoplana marginata. In 1955, Eudóxia Maria Froehlich noticed that Riester's species was different from the specimens analyzed by Graff and Marcus and renamed Riester's material as Geoplana caissara. In 1959, Claudio Gilberto Froehlich elevated Geoplana marginata var. abundans to the level of species as Geoplana abundans. He also noticed that G. marginata sensu Graff and G. marginata sensu Marcus could not be G. marginata Schultze & Müller, but did not rename them. In the same paper he also described a new yellow species with dark stripes and named it Geoplana fita. In 1990, Robert E. Ogren and Masaharu Kawakatsu transferred G. marginata (based on the descriptions by Graff and Marcus) to the genus Notogynaphallia along with G. caissara, G. abundans, G. fita and several other species. More than a decade later, from 2001 to 2006, Eudóxia Maria Froehlich and Ana Maria Leal-Zanchet analyzed the complex G. marginata (at the time Notogynaphallia marginata) and renamed G. marginata sensu Graff as Notogynaphallia graffi and G. marginata sensu Marcus as Notogynaphallia ernesti. They also described a new species with the same pattern, naming it Notogynaphallia ceciliae and pointed out that N. caissara, N. abundans, N. graffi, N. ernesti and N. ceciliae, and possibly also N. muelleri and N. fita, formed a complex of closely related species within the genus Notogynaphallia. Finally, in 2010, Fernando Carbayo transferred this species complex to a new genus, naming it Luteostriata.  Phylogeny  Species of Luteostriata have a similar morphology, including a similar color pattern, a musculo-glandular cephalic organ with a retractor muscle that is lens-shaped in cross-section, a long and folded male atrium and a prostatic vesicle located outside the muscular coat that envelops the copulatory organs. However, a molecular study on the phylogeny of the subfamily Geoplaninae suggested that Luteostriata is possibly paraphyletic, forming a monophyletic clade with the genera Issoca and Supramontana. The clade is supported by at least one synapomorphy, the presence of a cephalic retractor muscle derived from the longitudinal cutaneous ventral musculature that anteriorly dissipates by detaching its fibers, making them open in a fan-like fashion towards the body margins.

In 1949 Elizabeth Denby, together with the theatre director and playwright Velona Pilcher, the writer Elizabeth Sprigge, and Jane Drew converted a site at 29 Buckingham Gate, originally a Chinese restaurant destroyed in World War II during the Blitz, to create a performing space for their theatre club. This consisted of two club rooms, and a 70-seat theatre. In 1950 plans were made to increase the seating to 100, and for the walls to display murals designed by Marc Chagall. In 1950 Chagall started work on two studies for the projected murals – 'The Dance and the Circus' and 'The Blue Circus'. After Pilcher's death in 1952, Chagall gave his murals to the Tate Gallery, and the theatre was taken over by the New Watergate Theatre Club. In September 1950 it staged the premiere of George Bernard Shaw's Farfetched Fables, the last work Shaw completed,Far-Fetched Fables The Times (London, England), Wednesday 6 September 1950; p.6, issue 51789 and it also staged the English premiere of August Strindberg's The Great Highway,The Great Highway The Times (London, England), Friday 29 September 1950, p. 6, issue 51809 in a translation by Sprigge.

Goodwin) tries to talk to Bonnie (Kat Graham) but Bonnie is mad because she trusted Luka but Luka betrayed her. She also informs him that she knows he is working with Elijah and Jonas reassures her that Elijah wants to protect Elena and that he will personally make sure that Elena and her friends will not get hurt. Back at Tyler's house, Stefan tries to make Tyler understand that Caroline lied to him to protect his life and that they are all friends but after everything Jules told him, Tyler has hard time to which one to trust. In the meantime, Caroline runs into Matt (Zach Roerig) who wants to talk to her about their relationship. They arrange to meet later but when Caroline walks towards her car, Jules ambushes her and along with Brady, they kidnap her and lock her up in a cage at Brady's trailer where Brady tortures her. Jules calls Stefan from Caroline's phone and tells him that she wants Tyler otherwise she will kill Caroline. Stefan calls Elena who tells Damon about it and Damon gets mad at her for not telling him sooner. He leaves to solve the problem and leaves Elena behind with John keeping an eye on her so she will not follow him. Stefan arrives at Brady's trailer with Tyler and demands to see Caroline so they can make the trade. Jules does not intend to leave Caroline unless she gets Tyler. Damon appears who is not really willing to be as kind as Stefan is and asks for Caroline. He threatens Jules but when he does, about eight werewolves come out of the woods with sticks and blowtorches in their hands. Stefan lets Tyler go and he and Damon start fighting the werewolves. Tyler gets into the trailer and finds Caroline locked up in the cage. She asks him to help her but he hesitates before he let her free. Caroline gets out of the trailer and is ready to help Damon and Stefan but Jules gets to her and pulls a gun on her. Tyler watches without doing anything and just right before the werewolves kill Damon, Stefan and Caroline, all the werewolves except from Tyler collapse. Jonas comes out of the woods and informs everyone that Elijah promised to keep them safe and that's what he is doing. Damon, Stefan and Caroline leave and Jonas tells Tyler to let his friends know that they should leave the town when they wake up. Stefan escorts Caroline back home but he is worried about her after what she has been through. She says she is fine and Stefan leaves but he knows that she needs some friends so he asks Elena and Bonnie to come and stay with her. Before Elena and Bonnie arrive, Caroline receives a phone call from Matt who is waiting for her, something that Caroline had totally forgotten with everything that happened. She finds an excuse for not appearing by telling him that something happened to Bonnie and she had to be with her. Matt sees Bonnie sitting with Jeremy (Steven R. McQueen) at the Grill and knows that Caroline lies to him but he does not say anything. Tyler visits her as well to tell her how bad he feels about what happened and that he did not know Jules was going to come after her but Caroline is mad at him because he did not do anything to stop them when Jules and the other werewolves were about to kill them. She slams the door in his face and Tyler leaves confused. Damon meets with John who decided to trust Damon and he tells him how he can kill an Original. He gives him a dagger and a vial that contains ash, telling him that the ash comes from a white oak tree from the Original's genesis and it is the only tree that can kill the Originals. John explains Damon how to use it. Tyler goes back to Jules and Brady because he has nowhere else to go and at the moment they are his only friends. Jules and Brady wonder why Mason would stay at Mystic Falls risking his life and Tyler mentions the moonstone Mason was looking for, something that makes both, Jules and Brady look very interested in. The episode ends with John paying a visit to Katherine at the tomb. Katherine tells him that she sent a message to Isobel with Stefan and John reassures her that Isobel got her message. Katherine also says that she wants to get out of the tomb and John tells her that he is already on it.

Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic rated the episode with 4.8/5 saying that the episode was an exciting, action-packed one. \\"Overall, a tight, solid, focused hour of television that continued to raise the stakes.\\" Diana Steenbergen from IGN rated the episode with 8.5/10 saying that it was another jam-packed episode and that \\"The comparisons and contrasts between the vampires and werewolves in this episode were intriguing.\\" Steenbergen also comments on Damon's moral crisis and how the writers keep the character to the edge. \\"The delicate balancing act with Damon's character continues — on the one hand, the charisma Ian Somerhalder brings to Damon's reckless side is one of the best parts of the show, yet on the other hand, there is a limit to how many innocent people someone can kill while remaining convincingly on the good guys' side. Damon's current moral crisis has been emotional and affecting to watch, and it is a bold move for the show to continue to keep him so close to the edge.\\" E. Reagan from The TV Chick gave an A- rating to the episode saying that it was another great one with solid stuff in it. \\"Another great episode. Loved all of the Caroline stuff, and Damon’s creepy serial killer like thing at the end. [...] Solid stuff. Although, the wolf stuff is annoying me. Not the storyline, just the characters.\\" Carrie Raisler from The A.V. Club gave a B- rating to the episode focusing on the loyalty between the characters' relationships of the show: \\"Thus far in the series, loyalty is one of the strongest foundations for relationships on The Vampire Diaries. When dealing with as many secrets, lies, double crosses, schemes, and general tomfoolery as these characters do, knowing the people you surround yourself with have your back at all costs is essential. [...]In \\"Daddy Issues,\\" however, the focus is on the negative side of loyalty—to friends, to family members, even to your own kind—with mostly disastrous results for the characters.\\" Robin Franson Pruter of Forced Viewing gave the episode 2/4 saying that the episode is a storyline mishmash and not up the series' usual level of quality and states that the most interesting developments involve the relationship between Caroline and Tyler. \\"Without a unifying special event, \\"Daddy Issues\\" meanders through various storylines without ever giving a sense that the writers know what the episode is about. [...] The relationship between Caroline and Tyler would be complicated enough without the writers attempting to create unnecessary conflict by reviving the lifeless corpse of the Caroline/Matt romance. This needless attempt to pick up a storyline from the first season to put another obstacle in the way of Caroline and Tyler prevents the show from focusing on the bigger obstacle of vampire-werewolf enmity. This episode does use that obstacle effectively to push Caroline and Tyler apart, but the series fails to exploit the old Romeo & Juliet trope for all its proven narrative worth.\\" References External links * Category:2011 American television episodes Category:The Vampire Diaries (season 2) episodes ","title":"Daddy Issues (The Vampire Diaries)"},{"id":"43082974","text":"Eclipta bipunctata is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

The tournament was played between March 12 and March 14, 1970. All East Regional games were played at the Duluth Arena Auditorium in Duluth, Minnesota while West Regional games were held at the DU Arena in Denver, Colorado. By winning the regional tournaments, both the East Regional Champion†, Michigan Tech, and West Regional Champion‡, Wisconsin, were invited to participate in the 1970 NCAA University Division Men's Ice Hockey Tournament. Format The top eight teams in the WCHA, according to their final conference standings, were eligible for the tournament and were seeded No. 1 through No. 8. The eight teams were then divided into two separate groups by placing all even-numbered seeds in one group (2, 4, 6, 8) and the odd-numbered seeds (1, 3, 5, 7) in the other group. Using the location of the top seeds in each of the groups, the odd-numbered group (containing Minnesota) was placed in the east region which was held at the Duluth Arena Auditorium while the odd-numbered grouping (containing Denver) was placed in the west region which was held at the DU Arena. Once each regional group was set the teams were reseeded No. 1 to No. 4 according to their final conference standings. Because Minnesota-Duluth was placed in the West Region despite their building hosting the East Region they were swapped with the equivalent seed (Michigan State) in the East Region to allow them to play in their home venue. In the first round the first and fourth seeds and the second and third seeds in each region were matched in a single game with the winners advancing to their regional final games. The winners of the two championship games were declared as co-conference tournament champions. =Conference Standings= Note: GP = Games Played; W = Wins; L = Losses; T = Ties; PCT = Winning Percentage; GF = Goals For; GA = Goals Against Bracket Note: * denotes overtime period(s) East Regional =Semifinals= (1) Minnesota vs. (4) Minnesota-Duluth (2) Michigan Tech vs. (3) North Dakota =Finals= (1) Minnesota vs. (2) Michigan Tech West Regional =Semifinals= (1) Denver vs. (4) Michigan State (2) Wisconsin vs. (3) Michigan =Finals= (1) Denver vs. (2) Wisconsin Tournament awards None See also *Western Collegiate Hockey Association men's champions References External links *WCHA.com *1969–70 WCHA Standings *1969–70 NCAA Standings *2013–14 Denver Pioneers Media Guide *2013–14 Michigan Wolverines Media Guide; Through the Years *2013–14 Michigan State Spartans Media Guide; Section 5 *2013–14 Minnesota Golden Gophers Media Guide *2012–13 Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs Media Guide *2013–14 North Dakota Hockey Media Guide *2003–04 Wisconsin Badgers Media Guide Category:WCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament Wcha Men's Ice Hockey Tournament ","title":"1970 WCHA Men's Ice Hockey Tournament"},{"id":"43082983","text":"Eclipta bivittata is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae.

It is one of three preserved Baldwin Class 8/18 C 4-4-0 locomotives in the United States, the other two being the North Pacific Coast Railroad no. 12, the \\"Sonoma\\" displayed at the California State Railroad Museum, and the Eureka and Palisade Railroad no. 4, the \\"Eureka\\" which is privately owned, the latter of which it is the only operable example. It was common practice for American railroads of the 19th century to name their engines after Jupiter, \\"King of Gods\\", and other mythological figures to attract attention, thus the engine should not be confused with the engine of Golden Spike fame.  History  The locomotive was built in 1876 for the Santa Cruz Railroad, which was built to transport passengers and goods from the town of Santa Cruz, California to connect with the Southern Pacific Railroad in Watsonville. The engine served on this railroad until 1883, when the railroad was bought by the Southern Pacific and converted to Standard gauge. As converting the engines to the wider gauge would be costly and uneconomical, the railroad elected to sell off the inherited engines and use its own Standard gauge engines instead. As such, the Jupiter was sold to the Guatemala Central Railway, who dropped the engine's name but retained its number. In 1904, the Jersey City, New Jersey- based United Fruit Company consolidated the Guatemala Central, the Guatemala Northern, Guatemala Western, and Ocos Railways into the Guatemala Railway, who renumbered the engine as no. 61. In 1912, the Guatemala Railway and the Salvador Central Railway were consolidated into the International Railways of Central America.Best, Gerald M. “The Railroads of Guatemala and Salvador.” The Railway and Locomotive Historical Society Bulletin, no. 104, 1961, pp. 31–53. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/43517987. Accessed 25 Feb. 2020. The engine was renumbered 84 by the IRCA in 1928, and continued to transport fruit as well a small number of passengers along one of the railroad's branchlines in the northwestern part of the country until 1960. In the 1960s, United Fruit was purchased by New York entrepreneur and DC Transit operator O. Roy Chalk. For reasons unknown, Chalk selected the former Jupiter locomotive for display as part of a children's park he was developing in Washington D.C., and the engine was shipped to that city to be displayed. In D.C., the engine drew the attention of Smithsonian Institution curator John H. White, Jr., who had taken particular notice of the engine's year built. White convinced Chalk to donate the engine to the Smithsonian as part of their upcoming Bicentennial Exhibition of 1976. The engine was cosmetically restored to its as-delivered appearance, and placed on display in the Smithsonian's Arts and Industries Building in 1976 for the exhibit, which was a recreation of the displays of the Centennial Exposition of 1876. The engine was displayed in this building until 1999, when it was relocated to the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History on the opposite side of the National Mall, initially placed beside Southern Railway engine 1401. The engine was relocated again in 2004 (though it remained within the museum building) when the exhibits were reconfigured into the America on the Move exhibition, which features the engine displayed as part of a diorama recreating its arrival in Santa Cruz in 1876.

She was also known as Madame Gault de Saint-Germain. Biography She was born to a portrait painter named Józef Rajecki and raised as a protegé of king Stanisław August Poniatowski of Poland. It was at first believed that she was his illegitimate daughter and, later, that she was his mistress. In 1783, she was enrolled at his expense at the art school for females at the Louvre in Paris. She studied with Ludwik Marteau and Marcello Bacciarelli in Warsaw; Jean-Baptiste Greuze and possibly Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun in Paris. Although she later became part of the circle surrounding Jacques-Louis David, she probably took no lessons from him. The purpose of the Polish king in paying for her education was that she should return to Poland and become a professor of art, but she chose to remain in Paris after her marriage to the miniaturist, Pierre-Marie Gault de Saint-Germain in 1788. She became the first Polish female to have her work represented at the Salon in 1791 and apparently continued to receive support from the king until 1792. Although she sent many paintings back to Warsaw, Bacciarelli considered few to be worthy of adding to the Royal Collection. She painted the circle around the Polish royal court and, in Paris, received numerous commissions from the local aristocracy, thanks to the reluctant influence of the king's agent, Filippo Mazzei, who felt that she had little talent and was difficult to deal with. During the Reign of Terror, she fled from Paris to Clermont-Ferrand and may have given up painting. Information on this period of her life is sparse but, after many years, she returned to Paris and is said to have become blind around 1824.

Opponents of accidentalism maintain that what seems to be a chance occurrence is actually the result of one or more causes that remain unknown due only to a lack of investigation. Charles Sanders Peirce used the term tychism (from τύχη, chance) for theories that make chance an objective factor in the process of the Universe. In ethics the term is used, like indeterminism, to denote the theory that mental change cannot always be ascribed to previously ascertained psychological states, and that volition is not causally related to the motives involved. An example of this theory is the doctrine of the liberum arbitrium indifferentiae (\\"liberty of indifference\\"), according to which the choice of two or more alternative possibilities is affected neither by contemporaneous data of an ethical or prudential kind nor by crystallized habit (character).

Playing style Pirela is a free- swinger in the batter's box, with a 6.4% walk rate in the major leagues. Despite this, he has kept his strikeout rate at 19.9%. In the field, Pirela has appeared in the majors at first base, second base, third base, and in both of the outfield corners. His nickname is \\"La Cucaracha,\\" a nod to both his Hispanic heritage and the fact that Padres General Manager A. J. Preller designated several players for assignment before Pirela; fans believed the other players were more deserving of roster spots.

It contains several species adapted to human-disturbed environments, including the only invasive land planarian native to the Neotropical realm, Obama nungara, which has been accidentally introduced in Europe.  Description  The genus Obama is characterized by having a leaf-shaped body. Most species are about long, but some may reach over . The hundreds of eyes distributed along the body are of two types: monolobulated, which are simple and circular, and trilobulated, which have three lobes. The copulatory apparatus of Obama has a protrusible penis occupying the entire male atrium or most of it. Morphologically the genus can be divided in two subgroups depending on the shape of the penis papilla, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical. The group with an asymmetrical penis papilla includes 10 species (O. anthropophilla, O. carbayoi, O. carrierei, O. decidualis, O. josefi, O. ladislavii, O. marmorata, O. nungara, O. otavioi and O. ruiva) and seems to form a monophyletic clade within Obama. On the other hand, the group with a symmetrical penis papilla is paraphyletic, indicating that this is the ancestral state within the genus.  Etymology  The name Obama is formed by a composition of the Tupi words oba (leaf) and ma (animal), being a reference to the body shape of species in this genus.  Species  There are 41 species assigned to the genus Obama: *Obama allandra Marques, Rossi, Valiati & Leal-Zanchet, 2018 *Obama apeva (Froehlich, 1959) *Obama applanata (Graff, 1899) *Obama anthropophila Amaral, Leal-Zanchet & Carbayo, 2015 *Obama argus (Graff, 1899) *Obama assu (Froehlich, 1959) *Obama baptistae (Leal-Zanchet & Oliveira, 2012) *Obama braunsi (Graff, 1899) *Obama burmeisteri (Schultze & Müller, 1857) *Obama carbayoi (Oliveira & Leal- Zanchet, 2012) *Obama carinata (Riester, 1938) *Obama carrierei (Graff, 1897) *Obama catharina (Hyman, 1957) *Obama decidualis Amaral & Leal-Zanchet, 2015 *Obama dictyonota (Riester, 1938) *Obama divae (Marcus, 1951) *Obama eudoxiae (Ogren & Kawakatsu, 1990) *Obama eudoximariae (Ogren & Kawakatsu, 1990) *Obama evelinae (Marcus, 1951) *Obama ferussaci (Graff, 1897) *Obama ficki (Amaral & Leal-Zanchet, 2012) *Obama fryi (Graff, 1899) *Obama glieschi (Froehlich, 1959) *Obama itatiayana (Schirch, 1929) *Obama josefi (Carbayo & Leal-Zanchet, 2001) *Obama ladislavii (Graff, 1899) *Obama livia (E.

Froehlich, 1955)  Phylogeny  Three specimens of Obama of different species in a Petri dish. From top to bottom: O. ladislavii, O. anthropophila and O. nungara The genus Obama was erected after a study of molecular phylogeny with the subfamily Geoplaninae revealed that the genus Geoplana, originally containing more than a hundred species, was polyphyletic. One of the monophyletic clades revealed by the study was separate from Geoplana as the new genus Obama. All species within the new genus share a similar morphology, including the leaf-shaped body, the presence of a permanent penis papilla, ovovitelline ducts entering the female atrium dorsally and dorsal eyes of two types: mono- and trilobulated. The sister-group of Obama seems to be the genus Cratera, which has a very similar appearance but lacks trilobulated eyes.

The film is told from the monster's point of view as he is created, escapes into the modern world and learns about the dark side of humanity.  Plot  Victor Frankenstein (Danny Huston) and his wife, Elizabeth (Carrie-Anne Moss), are scientists who bring to life Adam: a fully- grown, handsome, young man (Xavier Samuel) with the mind of an infant. Adam's cells fail to replicate correctly and he soon develops deformities on his face and body. Dr. Frankenstein attempts to euthanize his creation with lethal injections but Adam thrashes and screams as the chemicals surge through his body. Victor then chokes him. Later, two scientists attempt to dissect an apparently dead Adam but he regains consciousness and kills both men. Adam escapes into a nearby forest and lives by scavenging. He adopts a friendly stray dog with whom he travels to the city. In a park he meets a little girl (Mckenna Grace) and they play a game of throwing sticks into a lake. Adam, still thinking that it is a game, picks up the girl and throws her into the water as well. She starts to drown, so he jumps in and saves her. When he brings her to shore, however, two policemen try to arrest him and shoot his barking dog to death. Adam assaults one officer and kills the other for killing his dog. A vigilante mob then chases Adam down while calling him a monster. Adam is taken to a police station where he is put into a straitjacket. When officers ask his name, Adam replies with \\"Monster\\", using the name the mob used for him, the same name he would use for himself in all social interactions. Almost completely non-verbal, he gives them Elizabeth's ID badge and calls her his mom. Elizabeth is brought to the station and denies knowing Adam, effectively abandoning him. Two vengeful policemen drive Adam to an empty lot, beat him and shoot him in the head. However, he survives, awakens hours later and wanders until he meets Eddie, a blind, homeless man (Tony Todd). Recognizing a childlike soul, Eddie kindly takes Adam under his wing. Adam's deformities worsen, but he continues to learn about the world and his ability to speak improves. Some time later, Eddie convinces a friendly prostitute named Wanda (Maya Erskine) to take Adam to a hotel to have sex with him but Wanda insists that he shower first. After he emerges from the shower, Wanda realizes how extensive his deformities are and tries to leave. Distraught, Adam snaps her spine while trying to prevent her from leaving. Eddie, having heard Wanda's screams, enters the room and discovers that she is dead. He then angrily beats Adam with his cane. Adam ends up accidentally killing Eddie as well. Feeling hopeless and angry, he uses the GPS on Wanda's phone to guide him to the Frankensteins' residence. While walking along a highway, Adam encounters two police officers, one of them being officer Banks, the same officer who shot him in the head several days earlier. The officers order Adam to stop. Instead, Adam grabs Banks' gun and shoots his partner. Banks and Adam recognize each other and Adam shoots Banks in the head. Adam encounters the Frankensteins after arriving at their luxurious home. Adam attacks Victor but Elizabeth calms him down. They show Adam his true origins and tell him that they named him Adam. He is angry to learn that he was created by the Frankensteins and that Victor was already attempting to replace him with another artificially created human. While Adam is distracted, Victor knocks him down and injects him with a sedative. Victor then attempts to decapitate him with a surgical handsaw while he's unconscious. Elizabeth tries to stop Victor by hitting him with a metal tray. Victor then swings the saw at her and accidentally slices her neck open. Victor flees and Elizabeth quickly bleeds to death. Adam takes Elizabeth's body into the nearby woods. He solemnly builds a large fire which he uses to immolate both Elizabeth and himself. While engulfed in flames, he cries, \\"I am Adam!\\"  Cast  *Xavier Samuel as Adam *Carrie-Anne Moss as Elizabeth Frankenstein *Danny Huston as Victor Frankenstein *Tony Todd as Eddie *Maya Erskine as Wanda *Mckenna Grace as Molly *Matthew Jacobs as Dr. Marcus *Jeff Hilliard as Officer Banks *Jorge Luis Pallo as Officer Lincoln *Ron Roggé as Officer Woodcock *Rob Mars as Officer Crawford *Mary Gallagher as Amy Johnson *John Lacy as Mark Rubin *Jeordie Osbourne White as Skid Row Man Release The film premiered April 12, 2015 at the Brussels International Fantastic Film Festival, followed by the Louisiana International Film Festival on May 9, 2015.

Overview Xfrog was developed to be an intuitive modeling method and GUI for creating natural branching structures based on the rules of nature. Structure and geometry is encapsulated in objects that form the description of the model. To define a model, icons (graphic representations of components) are assembled in a graph depicting the model’s structure and hierarchy, beginning with a root icon. Models are saved in the proprietary Xfrog .xfr format, a text file that contains the complete set of parametric rules for the procedural \\"Frog\\"engine to interpret and draw the polygonal model. History The first version of Xfrog was released as shareware in 1996 for Silicon Graphics, Sun Microsystems and Linux by Lintermann und Deussen GbR under the name GreenWorks Organic Software. The first customers were Industrial Light and Magic and Disney Imagineering. Xfrog 1.0 did not contain key frame or procedural recursive animation capabilities, but in 1998 Xfrog 2.0 introduced animation capabilities.

History  In the 10th century Aymar sire de Bourbon gave land in Souvigny to Cluny Abbey for the construction of a monastery. Some years later, two distinguished abbots of Cluny, Mayeul of Cluny and Odilo of Cluny (Odilon de Mercoeur), came here to die, one after the other, and were buried here. This made the priory a place of pilgrimage: even Hugh Capet, King of France, came here in 994 after the death of Mayeul. The church was rebuilt to accommodate the increasing numbers of worshippers, on the model of Cluny III, including two transepts, a choir with an ambulatory, and three towers. The Dukes of Bourbon made it their place of burial. Many chapels were added, and the upper parts of the church were rebuilt, with cross vaults. In 1097, Pope Urban II passed through Souvigny and while he was there confirmed by a Papal bull the possession of the church of Marigny to Bernard, fourth prior. This possession was confirmed again by a bull of Pope Eugene III dated 29 February 1152. In 1393, the provincial visitors instructed the prior to oblige the chantry to instruct children.Dom G. Charvin, Statuts, chapitres généraux, et visites de l'Ordre de Cluny, t. V, 1360-1408, Paris, De Boccard, 1969, p.333. Souvigny, as one of the five oldest daughter houses of Cluny, owned many parishes and small priories, which made it wealthy. Its priories included those of Saint-Patrocle-de-Colombier, Chantenay-Saint-Imbert, Mars-sur-Allier and Montempuis (Saint-Parize-en-Viry). The dedication varied between Saint Peter, Saint Mayeul and Saints Peter and Paul. The priory was closed down and largely dismantled in the French Revolution, but the church survived and was reopened for worship in 1852. It was declared a monument historique on 5 August 1919.  Architecture  = Priory church = Priory church The imposing priory church is part Romanesque and part Gothic. The structure is Romanesque but the vaulting is Gothic. The west front was reconstructed in the Gothic period while retaining the two Romanesque belltowers on top of it. This priory, because it was owned by the powerful Cluny Abbey, made it possible for the Burgundian style to develop in the numerous Romanesque churches of the Souvigny region. The church measures 84 metres in length; the vaulted roof is 17 metres high at its highest point. A carved Romanesque pillar was discovered in the church depicting a calendar with the farming works of each month, known as the \\"Zodiac of Souvigny\\".Voir sur www.lieux-insolites.fr. = Conventual buildings = The cloister, chapter room and porter's lodge are the principal conventual buildings still extant.

A magnetoquasistatic field is typically generated by low-frequency induction from a magnetic dipole or a current loop. The magnetic near-field of such an emitter behaves differently from the more commonly used far-field electromagnetic radiation. At low frequencies the rate of change of the instantaneous field strength with each cycle is relatively slow, giving rise to the name \\"magneto-quasistatic\\". The near field or quasistatic region typically extends no more than a wavelength from the antenna, and within this region the electric and magnetic fields are approximately decoupled. Weakly conducting non-magnetic bodies, including the human body and many mineral rocks, are effectively transparent to magnetoquasistatic fields, allowing for the transmission and reception of signals through such obstacles. Also, long-wavelength (i.e. low-frequency) signals are better able to propagate round corners than shorter-wave signals. Communication therefore need not be line-of-sight. The communication range of such signals depends on both the wavelength and the electromagnetic properties of the intervening medium at the chosen frequency, and is typically limited to a few tens of meters. Physical principles The laws of primary interest are Ampère's circuital law (with the displacement current density neglected) and the magnetic flux continuity law. These laws have associated with them continuity conditions at interfaces. In the absence of magnetizable materials, these laws determine the magnetic field intensity H given its source, the current density J. H is not everywhere irrotational. However, it is solenoidal everywhere.Haus, Hermann A., and James R. Melcher, Electromagnetic Fields and Energy. (Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT OpenCourseWare). http://ocw.mit.edu (accessed 18 June 2014). Equipment design A typical antenna comprises a 50-turn coil around a polyoxymethylene tube with diameter 16.5 cm, driven by a class E oscillator circuit. Such a device is readily portable when powered by batteries. Similarly, a typical receiver consist of an active receiving loop with diameter of one meter, an ultra-low-noise amplifier, and a band-pass filter.D. Arumugam, Two-dimensional position measurement using magnetoquasistatic fields http://disneyresearch.com pg.2 (accessed 17 June 2014). In operation the oscillator drives current through the transmitting loop to create an oscillating magnetic field. This field induces a voltage in the receiving loop, which is then amplified. Because the quasistatic region is defined within one wavelength of the electromagnetic source, emitters are limited to a frequency range between about 1 kHz and 1 MHz. Reducing the oscillating frequency increases the wavelength and hence the range of the quasistatic region, but reduces the induced voltage in the receiving loops which worsens the signal-to-noise ratio. In experiments carried out by the Carnegie Institute of Technology, the maximum range reported by was 50 meters.Arumugam, D. D. (2011). Position and orientation measurements using magnetoquasistatic fields. (Order No. 3516108, Carnegie Mellon University). ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, 159. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/1027933791 Applications =Resonant inductive coupling= In resonant coupling, the source and receiver are tuned to resonate at the same frequency and are given similar impedances. This allows power as well as information to flow from the source to the receiver. Such coupling via the magnetoquasistatic field is called resonant inductive coupling and can be used for wireless energy transfer. Applications include induction cooking, induction charging of batteries and some kinds of RFID tag. =Communications= Conventional electromagnetic communication signals cannot pass through the ground. Most mineral rock is neither electrically conducting nor magnetic, allowing magnetic fields to penetrate. Magnetoquasistatic systems have been successfully used for underground wireless communication, both surface-to-underground and between underground parties. At extremely low frequencies, below about 1 kHz, the wavelength is long enough for long- distance communication, although at a slow data rate. Such systems have been installed in submarines, with the local antenna comprising a wire up to several kilometers in length and trailed behind the vessel when at or near the surface. =Position and orientation tracking= Wireless position tracking is being increasingly used in applications such as navigation, security, and asset tracking. Conventional position tracking devices use high frequencies or microwaves, including global positioning systems (GPS), ultra-wide band (UWB) systems, and radio frequency identification systems (RFID), but these systems can easily be blocked by obstacles in their path. Magnetoquasistatic positioning takes advantage of the fact that the fields are largely undisturbed when in the presence of human beings and physical structures, and can be used for both position and orientation tracking for ranges up to 50 meters. To accurately determine the orientation and position of a dipole/emitter, allowance must be made not only for the field pattern generated by the emitter, but also for the eddy-currents they induce in the earth, which create secondary fields detectable by the receivers. By using complex image theory to correct this field generation from earth, and by using frequencies on the order of a few hundred kilohertz to obtain the required signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), it is possible to analyze the position of the dipole through azimuthal orientation, \\\\theta, and inclination orientation, \\\\phi. A Disney research team has used this technology to effectively determine the position and orientation of an American football, something not traceable through conventional wave propagation techniques due to human body obstruction. They inserted an oscillator-driven coil, around the diameter of the center of the ball, to generate the magnetoquasistatic field. The signal was able to pass undisturbed through multiple players.

Carbon monoxide-releasing molecules (CORMs) are chemical compounds designed to release controlled amounts of carbon monoxide (CO). CORMs are being developed as potential therapeutic agents to locally deliver CO to cells and tissues, thus overcoming limitations of CO gas inhalation protocols. CO is best known for its toxicity in carbon monoxide poisoning at high doses. However, CO is among endogenous gaseous signaling molecules and low dosing of CO has been linked to therapeutic benefits. Pre-clinical research has focused on CO's anti- inflammatory activity with significant applications in cardiovascular disease, oncology, transplant surgery, and neuroprotection. The majority of CO produced in mammals originates from the degradation of heme by the three isoforms of heme oxygenase, whereby HO-1 is induced by oxidative stress, CO, and an array of xenobiotics. HO-2 and HO-3 are constitutive. Other endogenous sources may include lipid peroxidation, The enzymatic reaction of heme oxygenase inspired the development of synthetic CORMs. The first synthetic CORMs were typically metal carbonyl complexes. A representative CORM that has been extensively characterized both from a biochemical and pharmacological view point is the ruthenium(II) complex Ru(glycinate)Cl(CO)3, commonly known as CORM-3. CORM classifications The simplest source of CO is from a combustion reaction via burning sources such as fossil fuels or fire wood. Sources releasing CO upon thermal decomposition or combustion are generally not considered CORMs. =Transition metal CORMs= The majority of therapeutically relevant CORMs are transition metal complexes primarily based on iron, molybdenum, ruthenium, manganese, cobalt, and rhenium =PhotoCORMs= The release of CO from carrier agents can be induced photochemically. These carriers are called photoCORMs and include both metal complexes and metal-free (organic) compounds of various structural motifs which could be regarded as a special type of photolabile protecting group. =ET-CORMs= Enzyme-triggered CORMs (ET-CORMs) have been developed to improve selective local delivery of CO. Some ET-CORM prodrugs are activated by esterase enzymes for site specific liberation of CO.Different design of enzyme-triggered CO-releasing molecules (ET-CORMs) reveals quantitative differences in biological activities in terms of toxicity and inflammation. Stamellou E, Storz D, Botov S, Ntasis E, Wedel J, Sollazzo S, Krämer BK, van Son W, Seelen M, Schmalz HG, Schmidt A, Hafner M, Yard BA, Redox Biol. 2014 Jun 5;2:739-48. doi: 10.1016/j.redox.2014.06.002. eCollection 2014. =Organic CORMs= Organic small molecules are being developed to overcome toxicity limitations of inorganic CORMs. Methylene chloride was the first organic CORM orally administered based on previous reports of carboxyhemoglobin formation via metabolism. The second organic CORM, CORM-A1 (sodium boranocarbonate), was developed based on a 1960s report of CO release from potassium boranocarbonate. In 2003, cyclic oxocarbons were suggested as a source for therapeutic CO including deltic acid, squaric acid, croconic acid, and rhodizonic acid and their salts. =Organic CO prodrugs= Recent years have seen increasing interests in organic CO prodrugs because of the need to consider drug developability issues in developing CO-based therapeutics (Ji, X.; Damera, K.; Zheng, Y.; Yu, B.; Otterbein, L.E.; and Wang, B. “Toward Carbon Monoxide-based Therapeutics: Critical Drug Delivery and Developability Issues” J. Pharm. Sci. 2016, 105, 406-416. PMID: 26869408). These CO prodrugs have tunable release rate, triggered release, and the ability to release more than one payload from a single prodrug (Ji. X.; Wang, B. “Strategies towards Organic Carbon Monoxide Prodrugs” Acc. Chem. Res. 2018, 51, 1377-85. PMID: 29762011). =Enzyme hybrids= Based on the synergism of the heme oxygenase system and CO delivery, a new molecular hybrid-CORM (HYCO) class emerged consisting of a conjoined HO-1 inducer and CORM species. One such HYCO includes a dimethyl fumarate moiety which activates NRF2 to thereby induce HO-1, whilst the CORM moiety also liberates CO. =Carbon monoxide releasing materials= Carbon monoxide releasing materials (CORMAs) are essentially novel drug formulations and drug delivery platforms which have emerged to overcome the pharmaceutical limitations of most CORM species. An exemplary CORMA developed by Hubbell consists of a formulation of micelles prepared from triblock copolymers with a CORM entity, which is triggered for release via addition of cysteine. Other CO-releasing scaffolds include polymers, peptides, silica nanoparticles, nanodiamond, magnetic nanoparticles, nanofiber gel, metallodendrimers, and CORM-protein (macromolecule) conjugates. =Carboxyhemoglobin infusion= Carboxyhemoglobin can be infused to deliver CO. The most common approaches are based on polyethylene glycol (PEG)-lyated bovine carboxyhemoglobin and maleimide PEG conjugated human carboxyhemoglobin. =Porphyrins= Porphyrin structures such as heme, hemin, and metallic protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) analogs (such as cobalt PPIX) have been deployed to induce heme oxygenase and subsequently undergo biotransformation to liberate CO, the inorganic ion, and biliverdin/bilirubin. Some PPIX analogs such as tin PPIX, tin mesoporphyrin, and zinc PPIX, are heme oxygenase inhibitors. Endogenous CO In the late 1960s Tenhunen demonstrated an enzymatic reaction for heme catabolism thereby identifying the heme oxygenase (HO) enzyme. HO is the main source of endogenous CO production, though other minor contributors have been identified in recent years. CO is formed at a rate of 16.4 µmol/hour in the human body, ~86% originating from heme via heme oxygenase and ~14% from non-heme sources including: photooxidation, lipid peroxidation, and xenobiotics. The average carboxyhemoglobin (CO-Hb) level in a non-smoker is between 0.2% and 0.85% CO-Hb (whereas a smoker may have between 4% and 10% CO-Hb), though geographic location, occupation, health and behavior are contributing variables. =Enzymes= Heme oxygenase Heme oxygenase (HO) is a heme-containing member of the heat shock protein (HSP) family identified as HSP32. Three isoforms of HO have been identified to date including the stress-induced HO-1 and constitutive HO-2 and HO-3. HO-1 is considered a cell rescue protein which is induced in response to oxidative stress and numerous disease states. Furthermore, HO-1 is induced by countless molecules including statins, hemin, and natural products. HO catalyzes the degradation of heme to biliverdin/bilirubin, ferrous ion, and CO. Though present throughout the body, HO has significant activity in the spleen in the degradation of hemoglobin during erythrocyte recycling (0.8% of the erythrocyte pool per day), which accounts for ~80% of heme derived endogenous CO production. The majority of the remaining 20% of heme derived CO production is attributed to hepatic catabolism of hemoproteins (myoglobin, cytochromes, catalase, peroxidases, soluble guanylate cyclase, nitric oxide synthase) and ineffective erythropoiesis in bone marrow. =Lipid peroxidation= The formation of CO from lipid peroxidation was first reported in the late 1960s and is regarded as a minor contributor to endogenous CO production. CO pharmacology Carbon monoxide is one of three gaseous signaling molecules alongside nitric oxide and hydrogen sulfide. These gases are collectively referred to as gasotransmitters. =Signaling= The first evidence of CO as a signaling molecule occurred upon observation of CO stimulating soluble guanylate cyclase and subsequent cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production to serve as a vasodilator in vascular smooth muscle cells. The anti-inflammatory effects of CO are attributed to activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. While CO commonly interacts with the iron atom of heme in a hemoprotein, it has been demonstrated that CO activates calcium-dependent potassium channels by engaging in hydrogen-bonding with surface histidine residues. CO has an inhibitory effect on numerous proteins including cytochrome P450 and cytochrome c oxidase CO is a modulator of ion channels with both excitory and inhibitory effects on numerous classes of ion channels such as voltage-gated calcium channels. =Distribution= CO has approximately 210x greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen. The equilibrium dissociation constant for the reaction Hb-CO ⇌ Hb + CO strongly favours the CO complex, thus the release of CO for pulmonary excretion takes some time. Based on this binding affinity, blood is essentially an irreversible sink for CO and presents a therapeutic challenge for the delivery of CO to cells and tissues. =Metabolism= CO is considered non-reactive in the body and primarily undergoes pulmonary excretion and less than 10% is oxidized.

He realized several expeditions against Amerindian people who attacked, kidnapped and took as prisoners other native people, in order of liberate those people. Biography Juan de Samaniego y Díez de Ulzurrun Xaca y Roncal was born in Estella, Navarra (Spain). He was a son of Lorenzo de Samaniego y Jaca and Catalina Díez de Ulzurrun y Roncal. Eventually, Juan de Samaniego earned the title of nobleman after verifying the notability of his four grandparents (his paternal grandparents were Martín de Samaniego and Inés de Jaca, while his maternal grandparents were Martín Díez de Ulzurrun y Margarita Roncal). So, he joined the Order of San Juan de Jerusalén in 1637. He joined the Spanish Army in his youth. There he had a distinguished military career, joining the Knights Hospitaller, a leading religious-military order. In 1663, the Viceroy Francisco Fernández de la Cueva appointed Juan de Samaniego y Jaca as Governor of Santa Fe de Nuevo México. During his administration in New Mexico, Franciscans denounced Samaniego, exposing 17 complaints against him, and he had troubles with some Amerindian peoples, who attacked and kidnapped people in some places in New Mexico. So, in some time, the Apaches attacked the Jumano village, kidnapping women and twenty local children. To rescue them, Samaniego sent an expedition led by Juan Domínguez de Mendoza to the Apache village. The expedition was successful and punished the Apache. New Mexico Office of the State Historian: Juan de Samaniego y Jaca. Posted by Rick Hendricks; retrieved June 17, 2014, at 23:45pm. The following year, Navajos attacked Jemez Pueblo killing nineteen people and taking another thirty-five. Samaniego sent a military expedition against them led again by Dominguez de Mendoza. The Spanish troops entered the Navajo village while they celebrated a ceremonial, killed several natives and abducted 211 people. Then, the Spanish militaries freed the people kidnapped by the Navajos. Blackhawk, Ned (2006). Violence over the Land: Indians and Empires in the Early American West. Harvard University Press. Page 29. This caused Samaniego to be threatened by Friar Antonio de Ibargary since Samaniego had punished Native Americans without consulting the priests. Later, Samaniego sent an expedition of exploration to the Nueces River, led by Diego de Guadalajara Bernardo de Quirós. Juan de Samaniego y Jaca was replaced by Juan Manso de Contreras in 1656 in the New Mexico government. Samaniego was established in Parral, Chihuahua (modern Mexico) where he became in attorney of Valerio Cortés del Rey, his former financial backer during his politic administration in New Mexico.

The pistol was hastily developed to supply the Croatian military soon after Croatia gained its independence from Yugoslavia, but it was soon after replaced by the HS2000.

The overall appearance of the pistol mostly resembles the P38, but the magazine capacity and single recoil spring below the barrel is closer to a Beretta. The safety also incorporates a manual decocking lever, located on the left side of the grip frame. It is entirely possible that the safety/decocker was based on the design of the Beretta Cheetah.http://modernfirearms.net/handguns/hg/hr/php-e.html Variants The PHP MV-9 is the most commonly seen variant of the pistol, which has a barrel length of .

It is a contributing property to the NRHP- listed Broadway Theater and Commercial District. History By the start of the twentieth century, A. Hamburger & Sons had even outgrown their Spring Street location, which had 520 employees working on five floors.

The department store closed in 1986 when May moved to the Seventh Marketplace and the building was turned into retail on the ground floors and a garment factory on the upper floors. In 2014 it was announced that Waterbridge Capital had agreed to buy the building for an estimated $115–130 million ; L.A. City Council member Jose Huizar indicated plans a mixed-use development to include offices, a hotel, stores and/or apartments or condominiums. The acquisition by Waterbridge Capital and New York real estate developer Jack Jangana - Broadbridge LA LLC - was completed on August 20, 2014. A spokesman for the company that helped broker the deal said plans include a 24-month renovation that will result in a \\"creative campus\\" similar to Twitter's headquarters building in San Francisco. The investors' goal is to create \\"one of the largest single tech centers\\" in the United States. By early 2020, the building was still being renovated when all construction projects in California was halted by orders of the state governor in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

It played an important role in the Indian freedom movement, as it played host to a number of under-trial freedom fighters like Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Savarkar and Agarkar. The jail was built by the British in the eighteenth century as on 1804. Originally located within the Dongri fort ramparts, building of a separate jail was first suggested by Aungler in 1671. The people initially detained here included both, Indians as well as British nationals. For instance, in March 1701, the Provost Marshal John Hall was confined to the Dongri jail for being drunk. As time progressed, especially towards the end of the nineteenth and beginning of twentieth centuries, its inmates mostly consisted of Indians, especially those charged with sedition (usually freedom fighters) or people awaiting trial. It now functions as a juvenile delinquents home for children who are below 18 years of age, convicted of crimes.

The book is a spinoff from the Tom Clancy universe and features FBI agent and The Campus operative Dominic “Dom” Caruso, who is President Jack Ryan’s nephew. It is the first novel in the franchise written after Clancy’s death during the previous year, as well as Greaney’s first solo contribution to the overall series. In the novel, Caruso must stop a seemingly rogue National Security Council (NSC) staffer who had run off with top secret documents and is being pursued by the Iranians and the Russians. It debuted at number three in the New York Times bestseller list. Plot summary Dominic “Dom” Caruso is in India, training with former Israeli commando Arik Yacoby on a six-week training program in Krav Maga. One night, the Yacoby family are attacked in a home invasion, which ends with one of the intruders detonating a suicide vest, killing the whole family and injuring Caruso. It was later revealed that the attack on Yacoby was the result of a recent data breach in the National Security Council (NSC), which staffer Ethan Ross inadvertently set into motion when he took top secret files and shared them with an international whistleblowing organization called the International Transparency Project (ITP). After the attack, the NSC schedules a lie detector test, which leads Ross to panic. He was then asked by ITP head Gianni Bertoli to scrape the government’s servers for classified data and store them in a flash drive as insurance in case the techniques for “beating the polygraph” does not work. Unbeknownst to them, the flash drive was provided by Iranian agent Mohammed Mobasheri, who had infiltrated ITP. Meanwhile, Caruso acquires help from David, a Mossad agent who was also investigating Yacoby’s death. When the lie detector test does not work, Ethan is forced to flee the country with the flash drive by offering classified intelligence to Venezuela in exchange for safe passage. He was then kept in a safe house in Panama; Caruso finds this out from David. His boss from The Campus, Gerry Hendley, sends director of transportation Adara Sherman to accompany him in surveilling the safehouse. However, the Russian government had taken interest in Ross through their connections in Venezuela, and try to snatch him. Caruso and Sherman dispatch the GRU forces, but Ross, Bertoli and Mobasheri escape. With David’s help, Caruso learns that Ross is on Geneva, Switzerland, the global headquarters of the ITP; he as well as FBI agents proceed there to apprehend the rogue staffer. Bertoli had arranged a press conference where Ross can go public about the top secret files that he had stolen from the NSC servers. However, the two become suspicious of Mobasheri’s true intentions. With the FBI agents approaching, he abducts Ross and Bertoli, intending to escape to Libya; the ITP leader is later killed. Caruso chases them to a chalet in the Alps. Caruso sees Ross being tortured by Mobasheri for the password to the data scrape. Outnumbered, he decides to kill him using a sniper rifle; the Iranian and his henchmen later flee the scene with the flash drive. Caruso manages to contact the local CIA deputy station chief in order to dispatch an infantry platoon training nearby to block Mobasheri’s escape. Caruso then apprehends Mobasheri and secures the data scrape.

His last novel, co-authored with Mark Greaney, Command Authority, was published posthumously on December 3, 2013. In keeping with the tradition of developing franchises from bestselling novelists like Ian Fleming and Robert Ludlum after their deaths, Clancy's lawyer, J. Thompson Webb, later signed agreements with publishing company G.P. Putnam's Sons continuing the Jack Ryan book franchise. Greaney was chosen to write the first novel in the post-Clancy Ryanverse; Putnam spokeswoman Alexis Welby said that \\"Greaney's gift is that he's able to hit the trifecta of what makes a great Clancy book: Tom's terrific characters, really well-done action scenes and that over-the- horizon prescience about world events that characterized Tom's books.\\" Reception =Commercial= Support and Defend debuted at number three on the Hardcover Fiction category of the New York Times bestseller list, as well as number five on the Combined Print & E-Book Fiction category of the same list, for the week of August 10, 2014. In addition, it debuted at number six on the USA Today Best Selling Books list for the week of July 31, 2014. Less than a year later, the paperback edition of the book peaked at number five on the Paperback Fiction category of the New York Times bestseller list. =Critical= The book received generally positive reviews. Publishers Weekly noted that \\"Clancy readers will hardly notice that Tom is no longer with us.\\" Kirkus Reviews praised the book as \\"another timely, techno-geeky thriller\\" and added that \\"It’s by-the-numbers stuff, with the requisite villainy, continent- hopping, décolletage, neat tools and cliffhangers. But, of course, that’s just what Clancy’s fans read him for, and Greaney carries on that entertaining tradition seamlessly.\\" References Category:2014 novels Category:Ryanverse Category:G. P.

The company is listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange and its stock is part of the S&P; Sri Lanka 20 Index. Lion Brewery produces the highest selling beer, Lion Lager, in both Sri Lanka and the Maldives. History The Ceylon Brewery was the first brewery established in Sri Lanka. It was established in 1849 by Sir Samuel Baker (1821–93) as a cottage industry, catering for the British colonial tea plantations in the hill country retreat of Nuwara Eliya. Nuwara Eliya was the ideal location for a brewery, with its cool climate and natural spring water. It wasn't however until 1881 that it began brewing on a commercial basis, with the Ceylon Brewery Company, managed by Messrs Bremer and Pa Bavary. In 1884 the brewery was taken over by the Mohan Meakin Brewery of India, who later sold out to Ceylon Brewery, operated by John Bagshawe Hampson. In 1911 the brewery was acquired by G.W. Lindsay White and received limited liability company status, as the Ceylon Brewery Limited. In 1921 brewery was extensively rebuilt with the establishment of several new producing plants. In the 1940s, that the company expanded its product range, introducing Lion Lager, Lion Pale Ale, Sinha Pilsner and Lion Stout and in 1948 the company opened an office in Colombo. In 1950 the company introduced canned beer to the Sri Lankan market but this was later withdrawn due to lack of demand. In 1962 it launched the Jubilee Ale (in celebration of the company's golden jubilee), which received a gold medal at the Monde Selection and gained second place at the Brewers and Allied Exhibition in London. In 1982 it released the Royal Pilsner, commemorating Queen Elizabeth II's visit to Sri Lanka, replacing the Sinha Pilsner. In 1993, the Ceylon Brewery became a subsidiary of Carson Cumberbatch & Co Ltd, a diversified group of Sri Lankan businesses. In 1996 the Carlsberg Group acquired a 25% share in Ceylon Brewery and the company was subsequently renamed Lion Brewery, with Ceylon Brewery remaining as a holding company. In 1998 Lion Brewery established a new 300,000 hL/yr capacity brewery in Biyagama, just outside the capital Colombo, with the Nuwara Eliya operations closing in July 2001. The capacity of the Biyagama brewery has subsequently been increased to 750,000 hL/yr. It is the market leader in Sri Lanka with an 82% market share. Lion is currently exported to the United States, Canada, the UK, Japan, Australia, Africa and the Maldives. In the Maldives it has a dominant market share. It also operates a joint venture with the Carlsberg Group, South Asia Breweries Ltd, with four breweries in India, including one each in Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Himachal and Kolkata. right In 2011 Grupo Modelo appointed Lion Brewery as the national distributor of Corona in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. In 2012 the company was appointed the sole importer and distributor of Diageo, as well Moët Hennessy, whose brands include Guinness, Johnny Walker, Smirnoff, J & B, Hennessy, Moët & Chandon and Dom Perignon. In November 2014, Lion Brewery and its subsidiary Pearl Springs (Private) Limited purchased Millers Brewery, transferring production of the Millers brands, including Three Coins, to its facility in Biyagama.

History  Initially found in 1789 as the \\"Bombay Herald\\", the newspaper's name was changed to \\"Bombay Gazette\\" in 1791. It remained the leading paper of the city for a long time and covered important events such as the first session of the Indian National Congress in 1885. The Bombay Gazette and Bombay Courier were the earliest English language Indian newspapers published in Bombay (now Mumbai). The newspaper continued to be published up to the early 1900s. Bombay Gazette started printing paper on silk from 26 April 1841. Surviving copies of the Bombay Gazette can be found in the British Library (Colindale collection).  Owners and editors  The owners and editors of Bombay Gazette included the British journalist and politician, James Mackenzie Maclean, Adolphus Pope (1821), Fair (1826), Francis Warden (1827), R. X. Murphy (1833), Grattan Geary (1890), Sir Frank Beaman and Galium (1840). It was not unheard of for its proprietors to include British civil servants. In 1911, Sir Pherozeshah Mehta and Benjamin Horniman attempted to purchase Bombay Gazette, to counteract the influence of another newspaper The Times of India, and to give a voice to Indian nationalists, but his attempts were thwarted by one of the directors, Sir Frank Beaman, which led Mehta to establish a separate newspaper, The Bombay Chronicle in 1913.  Content  Bombay Gazette commenced as a weekly newspaper, in 1825 and was published every Wednesday. After some forty years, it became a bi-weekly. The newspaper contained articles of local interest, especially those concerning Bombay city itself, proclamations, obituaries (mostly of British residents and rich Indians) advertisements and news regarding the British colonial government in India. For instance, on 13 January 1880, Bombay Gazette published a news article - > \\"A large hyena is prowling about Malabar Hill on the western side between > Mr. Nicol's residence and Vaucluse, as good sport as a Mazagon tiger.\\" It was known to oscillate its stand between extremes of conservative pro- establishment to liberal pro-Indian, based on the opinions of the current editor and owner. The newspaper employed both Eurasian and Indian reporters, and a Parsi reporter for legal articles (Nanabhoy Masani and later, Darashaw Chichghar).

On January 3, 1961, US President Dwight D. Eisenhower severed relations following the Cuban Revolution of the 1950s.United States severs diplomatic relations with Cuba History. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter and President Fidel Castro signed an Interests Sections Agreement that permitted each government to operate out of its former embassy in Havana and Washington D.C., which were called Interests Sections; they were prohibited from flying their respective flags. Cuban President Raúl Castro and US President Barack Obama restored full diplomatic connections on July 20, 2015. The building housed the United States Interests Section in Havana between 1977 and 2015, which operated under the auspices of the Swiss Embassy (acting as protecting power). On July 1, 2015 it was announced that with the resumption of diplomatic ties, the building resumed its role as the U.S. Embassy in Cuba on July 20, 2015. After the allegations of sonic attacks surfaced in 2017, United States withdrew most of the personnel from the embassy, so by July 2018 only 10 American diplomats were left to maintain the diplomatic service.

The current embassy was designed in the Modernist—Brutalist style by the architectural firm Harrison & Abramovitz. It is a long and six-story concrete and glass building, completed in 1953. The gardens were designed by Californian landscape architect Thomas Dolliver Church. The contractor for the building was Jaime Alberto Mitrani, PE, also a professor of civil engineering at the University of Havana. The embassy complex is located directly on the Malecón and the José Martí Anti- Imperialist Platform, in proximity to the Cuban Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The State Department determined that the health problems may have been the result of an attack or else exposure to an as-yet-unknown device, and did not believe the Cuban government is responsible.U.S. does not believe Cuba is behind sonic attacks on American diplomats. McClatchy News Service, 26 September 2017 Affected individuals described mild brain damage similar to a concussion and symptoms such as temporary or permanent hearing loss, memory loss, and nausea. Speculation has centered around a sonic or ultrasonic weapon, however the scientific consensus is that the use of a sonic weapon is implausible. Dr. Timothy Leighton has said \\"If you’re talking about a ray-gun rifle knocking out someone with ultrasound they can’t hear at a hundred meters — that’s not going to happen\\". The United States expelled two Cuban diplomats in response to the attacks; the Cuban government offered to cooperate with the US in an investigation of the incidents. In September, the US State Department stated that it was removing non-emergency staff from the US embassy, and warned US citizens not to travel to Cuba. In October 2017, the Associated Press released what it claimed was a recording of the sound some embassy workers heard during the attacks. However, senior neurologists consulted by The Guardian suggested that the health incidents were probably psychosomatic complaints, of the kind commonly known as mass hysteria. In December 2017, investigators discovered abnormalities in the victims' brains. The white matter of the brains showed physical changes which doctors believe could not have been caused by sound. They are now avoiding the term \\"sonic\\" to describe the attacks and there is growing skepticism it was caused by a sonic device; rather, it's possible that the sound heard by victims was a by-product of the brain damage. In a 2018 paper published in JAMA, a team of medical researchers at the University of Pennsylvania all but ruled out a sonic weapon and said they could not find the source of the ailments experienced by the embassy staff. They said that the report by the Associated Press claiming researchers had found damage to white matter in the brains of the patients was wrong and that there was no such damage. In January 2019 a study of a recording of the sound heard by embassy staff was released by Alexander Stubbs, a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, and Fernando Montealegre-Zapata, a professor of sensory biology at the University of Lincoln. The study found that the sound matched the mating song of the Indies short-tailed cricket found around the Caribbean. The researchers did not examine the cause of the diplomats’ ailments and did not rule out a sonic attack “at another point”. James Lewis, a former State Department official and intelligence expert, stated: \\"We know with 100% certainly that the embassies are under surveillance, and the technology being used could just be crude and over-powered\\"; he noted that health problems at the US embassy in Moscow in the 1970s were thought to be linked to the use of microwave surveillance devices.

Juan Manso was appointment Governor of Santa Fe de Nuevo México in 1656. He issued legislation against the Pueblo Native Americans, because of his religion. Contreras created many enemies among the Spanish settlers of New Mexico. One of them was the Soldier Francisco de Anaya Almazán (who occupied several importants charges in the military and administrative areas). Anaya was jailed (although he escaped with the help of Pedro Lucero de Godoy and Francisco Gómez de Robledo). The reasons of imprisonment of Anaya are unknown. Manso was replaced by Bernardo López de Mendizábal in the New Mexico government in 1656. After that, Contreras moved to Mexico City, where he lived until 1661. In that year, he was charged with Alguacil mayor, or chief constable, to New Mexico to arrest López following a commission from the Inquisition. Mendizabal was arrested in the spring of 1663 and Contreras moved to Parral, in New Vizcaya where he became an administrator of the New Mexico mission. He supplied wagons while working in Parral.

John Gilman House is a historic house at 25 Cass Street in Exeter, New Hampshire, United States. Built in 1738, it is a well-preserved example of a Georgian gambrel-roof house, further notable for its association with the locally prominent Gilman family. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. Description and history The John Gilman House is located north of Exeter's commercial and civic downtown area, at the southest corner of Cass and Park streets. It is a -story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof and clapboarded exterior. Its main facade is five bays wide, with a central entrance flanked by pilasters and topped by a transom and gabled pediment. Windows are topped by shallow projecting cornices on the ground floor, and butt against the eave on the second floor. The windows themselves appear to be c. 1830 Greek Revival replacements, and are narrower and taller than typical Georgian windows. The interior was subjected to a careful restoration of its 18th-century character in the 1960s. The house was built in 1738 by Colonel John Gilman for his son, also named John. The elder Gilman lived in the nearby Gilman Garrison House, in which his son was born. It is one of only three gambrel-roofed houses to survive in the town from the Georgian period, and it is the least-altered of those. The Gilmans, both father and son, were prominent in the local militia and town affairs. Later residents included Thomas Odiorne, son-in-law of the younger Gilman, who was a successful merchant and manufacturer of equipment and parts for sailing ships. Major John Gilman held an enslaved African boy of fourteen years old, Caesar Nero Paul, in this house as a house-boy. Caesar later accompanied him to the French and Indian Wars, was captured, then returned to Exeter in 1771 and lived as a free man. Caesar married Lovey Rollins and was the father of noted Baptist minister Rev. Thomas Paul and two other ministers. His daughter Rhoda married noted black Revolutionary soldier Jude Hall, and another daughter, Nancy, was the mother of black abolitionist poet James Monroe Whitfield.

During his 1951-1952 season with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, he became known as a member of the Symphony Six, a group of six musicians under contract to the orchestra who were denied entry to the United States for a concert tour under suspicion of leftist activities. Early life and career William Kuinka was born in Prince Rupert, British Columbia. He served in World War II and was part of an army show unit. After the war, he studied at The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto with Charles Rose, John Weinzweig, John Moskalyk, and others; at the Advanced School of Contemporary Music in Toronto, and in New York City. Kuinka played double bass with the CBC Symphony Orchestra, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the Pro Arte Orchestra, and the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra. Self-taught in mandolin and guitar, he played mandolin with the Ivan Romanoff orchestra. Symphony Six Kuinka played only one season (1951-1952) with the Toronto Symphony Orchestra. In November 1951 the Toronto Symphony Orchestra was invited to participate in the \\"Major Symphony Series\\" in Detroit, its first appearance in the United States, alongside major US orchestras from Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, and Philadelphia. In keeping with US immigration laws, the orchestra submitted its list of members for clearance. Seven musicians were not given clearance; this was later pared down to six: Kuinka, Dirk Keetbaas, Abe Mannheim, John Moskalyk, Ruth Budd, and Steven Staryk (later known as the Symphony Six), who were denied access to the United States under suspicion of leftist activities.Warren (2002), pp. 51-53.

Beta Delta Alpha has aimed to provide benefits to its community in order to remain consistent with its mission statement. Beta Delta Alpha has had two blood drives, a Diddy Riese cookie fundraiser for Typhoon Haiyan victims, and volunteered with The Network of Arab American Professionals (NAAP).“BDA Portfolio.” Beta Delta Alpha. Accessed June 19, 2014. http://www.betadeltaalpha.org/about-us/bda-portfolio/. =Cultural enrichment, awareness, and skill building= There are many facets to Arab culture and customs. Beta Delta Alpha aims to serve its brothers and its immediate community with cultural enrichment experiences. Arab dances, Arab festivities, and Arab cultural education events are some of many ways that the fraternity has diffused cultural enrichment to its surroundings. By endorsing cultural enrichment, all Beta Delta Alpha brothers are expected to make good impressions and contributions to the people they interact with through their intuition and well-versed knowledge on Arab culture and customs. Intuition and knowledge are reflected by talks, dance, song, cuisine, and conventional Arab recreational activities (i.e. backgammon, dabke, gatherings, dealing with different Arab age groups, cooking Arab dishes, celebrating festivities with unique customs, etc.). In addition to cultural enrichment, all brothers of Beta Delta Alpha must demonstrate awareness surrounding their own culture (for non-Arabs, one must still express desire to become aware of Arab culture). Brothers become more aware of Arab culture through social events, educational meetings (pledge meetings, fraternity discussion, etc.), co-programming with other cultural groups, and by means of cultural enrichment. Beta Delta Alpha participated with UCLA's World In-Sight Fair, a fair that presented the many cultures present at UCLA, and taught fair participants about interesting aspects of Arab culture. With cultural enrichment and awareness comes cultural skills. Beta Delta Alpha brothers are encouraged to learn skills that will enhance their respective cultural statuses. Dances like dabke and hosat, alongside talent in instruments used across the Arab world (oud, bozuk, violin, tabla, and accordion) are present among brothers of Beta Delta Alpha. =Social engagement= Through a variety of socials, dinners, banquets, retreats, inter-fraternity and sorority activities, and participation with the university community, all brothers of Beta Delta Alpha ineluctably engage with diverse people.

History The San Diego Brewing Company opened in 1896 as the first commercial brewery in San Diego County. It was financed by wealthy locals including John D. Spreckels and quickly became the largest manufacturing enterprise in the county. It was located on 32nd street in San Diego. It operated on a large scale; in 1906 it added a state-of-the-art, 100-ton compressor for refrigeration. At first the company delivered kegs of beer in horse-drawn wagons; by 1914 it had switched to motor vehicles. The brewery delivered 140,000 barrels a year, locally to saloons and hotel bars, as well as out of town by rail, shipping beer as far as San Francisco and Arizona. The company acquired several other local breweries, including Mission Brewery, and in 1914 it took the name San Diego Consolidated Brewing Company. The company stopped brewing in 1920 because of Prohibition. For a time it produced a near beer called Hopski, but in 1925 it abandoned that as well. In 1935, with the passage of the Twenty-first Amendment to the U.S. Constitution repealing the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the company resumed brewing operations. It continued in operation until 1942, when it was displaced by the U.S. Navy's 32nd Street Naval Station. Current brewery A brewpub by the same name now operates in Mission Valley.

The highway was part of the primary highway system for 23 years; it was designated in 1980 and removed in 2003. After it was turned over, it became County Road L14. Route description Iowa 91 began in rural Lyon County at an intersection with Iowa 9 at a point nearly equidistant to Rock Rapids in the west, Little Rock east, and George south. It headed north over flat terrain with farmland on both sides of the highway. Near the midpoint of the route, it crossed a branch of Tom Creek, which itself is a branch of the Rock River. The highway ended at the Minnesota state line south of Ellsworth. It continued north as Minnesota State Highway 91. History Iowa 91 was designated in late 1980 when the Iowa Department of Transportation took over control of County Road K64 (CR K64) in Lyon County; however, it did not show up on the state map until the 1983 edition. The route was paved when it was added to the primary highway system. In 2002, more than of low-traffic state highways, including Iowa 91, were identified by the Iowa DOT because they primarily served local traffic. Typically, when the DOT wished to transfer a road to a county or locality, both parties had to agree to terms and the DOT would have to either improve the road or give money to the other party to maintain the road. However, with the significant mileage the DOT wished to turn over, the Iowa General Assembly passed a law which granted the DOT a one-time exemption from the transfer rules effective July 1, 2003.

Thomas who was the subject of nearly 10 hours of interrogation by Troy, New York police, culminating in a controversial confession and high profile murder trial. The film won multiple festival awards, a Gotham Award for \\"Best Film Not Playing At Theater Near You,\\" played theatrically and was broadcast nationally. Reviews of the film were highly favorable. Background Producer/Directors Grover Babcock and Blue Hadaegh were interested in making a documentary about the psychology of modern police interrogation, and the risks of false confession. They sought a case that featured an extensive video- recording of a long interrogation that culminated in a dispute over the confession. Since many police departments do not routinely record full interrogations, and instead record conversations only once a suspect has agreed to confess, it was difficult to locate a suitable case. Eventually, they learned of the video-recorded interrogation of Adrian P. Thomas, a 26-year-old father from Troy, New York. Local police had interrogated Thomas for nearly 10 hours in 2008, after they were told, mistakenly, by medical staff at Albany Medical Center that Thomas's dying son Matthew showed clear evidence of a \\"shaken baby\\" type attack. Over successive rounds of intense psychological manipulation, including lies about evidence against him, and promises of leniency, Troy detectives eventually convinced Thomas to confess to harming his son; crucially, they threatened to pursue Thomas's wife as a suspect if he didn't comply, and assured him that he would spend no time in jail for an \\"accidental\\" attack. Detectives then acted out an attack scenario for him, which Thomas then demonstrated. Thomas signed a statement written by police, and was surprised he was then arrested. He soon recanted his confession. All of the interrogation room activity was secretly video-recorded by police. The documentary inspired high profile organizations such as the Legal Aid Society, Center on Wrongful Convictions and the Innocence Project to support Thomas's appeal. After a setback in New York's 3rd Appellate Department, Thomas won his appeal to the New York Court of Appeals based on a coercive interrogation, resulting in an order for a new trial. The Court said the police methods \\"raised a substantial risk of false incrimination.\\" On June 12, 2014, in the second trial, Thomas was found not guilty for the second degree murder of his infant son Matthew Thomas, and immediately freed. Subject matter By closely examining the Adrian Thomas case, the documentary shows in detail the way currently accepted psychological interrogation techniques can distort investigations and make outcomes less reliable. Specifically, in the Thomas case the film pushes against the assumption that innocent people will not confess to a crime that they did not commit. The documentary is largely based on a nearly 10-hour videotaped interrogation of Adrian P. Thomas over a two-day period in September 2008 by Troy, New York, police officers. The technique of interrogation seems to closely follow the Reid Technique, which is a long-established nine-step procedure that uses psychological manipulation to extract a confession. While sequences of video from this interrogation are at the center of this documentary, there are also interviews with key individuals in the case. These interviews include the police officers who conducted the interrogation, the prosecuting district attorney, the defense attorneys, two of the jurors, and expert witnesses. One of the jurors interviewed for the film stated after the trial: \\"We saw the video. You could just tell that he was guilty.\\" According to Kenneth Turan, writing for the Los Angeles Times, the most noteworthy aspect of this case was how it began with scant evidence. When the police went to the hospital, Dr. Walter Edge (who declined to participate in the film) told them that Thomas' infant son had died of a fractured skull and told them \\"somebody murdered this child.\\" The police shortly thereafter assumed the injury was caused by Adrian Thomas and proceeded to extract a confession from him. Subsequent examination found no skull fracture and found inconclusive evidence for a high-impact head injury. Critical reception Eric Hynes, writing for Time Out, opines that while the film addresses the issue of legally sanctioned coercion in police interrogations, it does not address issues of how race affected the verdict in the trial. Writing for The Village Voice, Mark Holcomb says that \\"What's remarkable about Scenes of a Crime, besides Hadaegh and Babcock's ability to stay out of the way of their story and resist flashy graphical flourishes, is the degree to which the events it reveals are business as usual.\\" Nick Schager, writing for Slant Magazine, states that the \\"film is an impressive piece of reportage free of overt or pushy bias, with equal time granted to Adrian's defense team.\\" Eddie Cockrell writing for Variety points out that \\"Blue Hadaegh and Grover Babcock borrow liberally from the Errol Morris nonfiction playbook; as imitation is the sincerest form of flattery...\\" Awards In 2011, Scenes of a Crime won a Gotham Award for \\"Best Film Not Playing At Theater Near You\\".

He was also variously known as \\"Kavyakantha\\" (one who has poetry in his throat), and \\"Nayana\\" by his disciples. Biography Ganapati Muni was born in Kalavarayai near Bobbili in Andhra Pradesh on 17 November 1878. His parents, Narasimha Sastri and Narasamamba had three sons, Muni being the second. Ganapati, when 18 years old, set out and wandered from one place to another, residing in places like Bhuvaneshwar, where he performed his tapas. When Ganapati was staying in Varanasi he learned of an assembly of Sanskrit scholars in the city of Nabadwip in Bengal. He participated in it and on passing the tests in extempore Sanskrit prose and poetry, was conferred the title 'Kavyakantha'. He was then 22 years old. He returned home at the age of 25. From Kanchipuram he came to Arunachala (Tiruvannamalai) in 1903 to perform tapas. At that time he visited Ramana Maharshi, who was then known as Brahmanaswami, before he accepted a teaching post in Vellore in 1904. He wrote his devotional epic hymn \\"Uma Sahasram,\\" One Thousand Verses on Uma (goddess Parvathi), after accepting Ramana Maharshi as his Guru on 18 November 1907. He also met Sri Aurobindo on 15 August 1928. Ganapati Muni died at Kharagpur on 25 July 1936. Influence Ganapati Muni's teachings are laid out in his magnum opus, 'Uma Sahasram' and other works like 'Mahavidyadi Sutras'. They helped to reduce popular prejudice about the teachings of Tantra.

It was directed by Ian Cheney and produced by Amanda Murray and Jennifer 8. Lee. Sundance Selects acquired it in December 2014, and was released January 2, 2015, in theaters and on demand. Synopsis The film begins by exploring theories about General Tso. The film then shifts focus to China, where few recognize the eponymous dish. The film then traces Tso's real-life history in the Qing Dynasty as well as the history of Chinese immigration to the United States. Interviewed are a number of notable figures in Chinese-American cuisine, such as Cecilia Chiang of The Mandarin, a world record-holder for restaurant menus and Chef Peng Chang-kuei, who invented the dish in Taiwan. Development Around 2004, Cheney and his best friend were driving across America when they stopped at a Chinese restaurant \\"with red booths and neon signs\\" and ordered General Tso's chicken. The experience prompted them to investigate the history of Chinese food in America. In 2008, Lee wrote a book about the history of Chinese food in the United States and around the world, titled The Fortune Cookie Chronicles, documenting the process on her blog. She reported the unlikely, but true, story of how a batch of fortune cookies created 110 Powerball lottery winners. To the surprise of many non-Chinese readers, she reported that fortune cookies are found in many countries but not China and that fortune cookies may have originated in Japan. Warner Books editor Jonathan Karp struck a deal with Lee to write a book about \\"how Chinese food is more all-American than apple pie\\".\\"Jennifer 8. Lee Attracts Americans with Chinese Food\\" , October 13, 2008. Source: Xinhua/Translated by womenofchina.cn She appeared on The Colbert Report to promote the book.\\"Jennifer 8.

In addition to premiering at Tribeca, the film played at the Seattle International Film Festival AFI Docs, and the Independent Film Festival of Boston.

It first aired in Canada on Space and the United States on BBC America on 7 June 2014. The episode was written by Karen Walton and directed by the series' co-creator John Fawcett. The series focuses on a number of identical human clones, all of whom are played by Tatiana Maslany: Sarah Manning, Alison Hendrix, Cosima Niehaus and Rachel Duncan. This episode introduces a new clone, Tony Sawicki (Maslany), a transgender man whose search for another clone leads him to Sarah's foster brother Felix Dawkins (Jordan Gavaris). Meanwhile, the founder of the cloning program, Professor Ethan Duncan (Andrew Gillies), meets with his adoptive daughter Rachel and attempts to find a cure for Cosima's illness, while Alison and her husband Donnie (Kristian Bruun) attempt to hide a dead body. The show's co- creators, Fawcett and Graeme Manson, along with Maslany and her hair and makeup artists, developed the character of Tony over a period of six months after deciding that the inclusion of a transgender character would fit well with the show's themes of identity, gender and sexuality. Overall, the episode received mixed reviews: critics praised Maslany's performance but found Tony's character underdeveloped and gimmicky and found the plot disorganised. Plot The episode opens with Tony Sawicki rushing his friend Sammy, who has just been shot, to an empty warehouse. Before dying, Sammy implores Tony to find Beth Childs and pass on a message to her. Not knowing that Beth is dead, Tony's call to Beth's phone is answered by her former partner, suspended detective Art Bell, who brings Tony to Felix. Realising that Tony is a transgender clone of his foster sister Sarah Manning, Felix ascertains that Tony is unaware of his origins, but refuses to impart any information until Sarah arrives. After Sarah arrives at Felix's apartment and explains to Tony that they are clones, he is unflustered. He passes on Sammy's message for Beth, although neither Sarah or Felix understand what it means. Felix gives Tony his, Sarah and Art's phone numbers and shares a kiss with Tony before he leaves again. Alison Hendrix returns home from rehab to find her husband Donnie drunk and chastises him. When she catches him trying to leave the house in the middle of the night, she persuades him not to give up on their marriage. In an effort to open up to him, she confesses that she played a role in the death of their neighbour Aynsley, and is shocked when Donnie responds by confessing that he accidentally shot and killed Dr. Aldous Leekie, the director of the Dyad Institute, the night before. When Alison asks what he did with Leekie's body, Donnie leads her to their garage where Leekie's corpse is wrapped in the trunk of their car. Rachel Duncan, who works for the Dyad Institute, promotes Delphine Cormier to the role formerly held by Leekie, who had been ordered dead when Rachel let him escape the previous night, with the official cover story that he died of a heart attack on a private jet. Rachel sets Delphine the task of convincing Professor Ethan Duncan—a founding scientist of the clone program and Rachel's adoptive father—to come into Dyad to help find a cure for the illness that has befallen Cosima Niehaus, another clone. When Ethan arrives, Rachel questions him about why she cannot reproduce, and he reveals that all of the clones were intended to be infertile by design. In response, she breaks down in anger and trashes her office. Also working at the Dyad Institute, Cosima refuses to work with her girlfriend and monitor Delphine after Delphine's recent betrayal. They later reunite and get high in their laboratory together, after which they profess their love for each other. Before Ethan arrives at Dyad to meet Cosima, she confesses to her lab assistant Scott that the clone subject they are researching is in fact herself. Shortly after meeting Ethan, Cosima begins to cough and vomit blood before falling to the ground and seizing. Production John Fawcett (pictured) and Graeme Manson spent more time developing Tony's character than any other character on the show. The episode introduced Tony Sawicki, a trans man and another clone played by Maslany. The character was first imagined by Manson and Fawcett during the development of the show's first season; they thought that introducing a transgender clone character would be \\"very tied to the themes of our show about identity\\" and would fit well with the previous season's themes of gender and sexuality. When they approached Maslany with the idea at the end of the first season, she told them that she had already thought about playing a transgender character herself. It took the show's creators longer than with any other character to develop and refine Tony's personality and wardrobe, the entire process taking six months. In preparation for the part, Maslany researched and met with transgender people and grew out her underarm hair for six weeks, although she eventually had to shave her underarms to attend an awards ceremony before the episode was filmed. The new character was kept secret from most of the crew until scripts for the episode were distributed, and the show's hair and makeup department trialled different looks for Tony on Maslany's days off and weekends so that other members of the crew would not see her in Tony's costume. Tony's final look was created by Stephen Lynch, Sandy Sokolowski and Debra Hanson, in the show's makeup, hair and wardrobe departments, respectively. Manson, Fawcett and Maslany sought advice from GLAAD on how to best go about introducing a transgender character. In response to the perception that Tony's introduction had created \\"a minefield of sexual politics\\", Fawcett said that that had not been the writers' intention; rather, their aim was to \\"just throw this character in there and treat them like a normal human being like we would anyone else on the show\\". Unlike most other episodes, the scenes which featured multiple clones were filmed using traditional locked-off cameras rather than the time- consuming Technodolly camera set-up. The episode featured the longest continuous shot filmed in Orphan Black, where a scene between Felix, Tony and Sarah was filmed in one take. It took almost three days to film the 15-second sequence of Scott drilling into Kira's tooth, involving three rented cameras and a prop tooth that was painted red inside and filled with white dust to achieve the desired effect when drilled into. The scene in which Cosima and Delphine use a vaporiser to get high was mostly improvised by Maslany and Brochu; instead of inhaling actual helium, the pitch of their voices was altered in post-production. A stunt double was used for the second-to-last scene, wherein Cosima falls to the ground after vomiting blood. The episode features Cosima and her lab assistant Scott playing the board game Runewars. Fawcett, who describes himself as \\"a massive board game fan\\", contacted the game's creators at Fantasy Flight Games for permission to use Runewars in the show and employed one of his friends as a consultant for the episode. As a consultant, his friend set up the board for the scene, taught the involved actors how to play the game, checked for accuracy of the gameplay and dialogue about the game, and had a non-speaking cameo appearance in the scene as one of the board game players. Manson chose to incorporate H. G. Wells' science fiction novel The Island of Doctor Moreau, which Ethan Duncan reads to Kira, into the episode since he felt that the novel's themes \\"run so deep in our show\\". The book cover featured in the episode was designed by the show's art department. The episode's title, \\"Variable and Full of Perturbation\\", is taken from a quote from Francis Bacon's philosophical work Novum Organum: \\"the spirit of man (according as it is meted out to different individuals) is in fact a thing variable and full of perturbation, and governed as it were by chance.\\" Reception Critics praised Tatiana Maslany's performance in the episode. The episode was aired in the United States on 7 June 2014 on BBC America. It was watched by 576,000 viewers and was the 14th most-watched program of the night. It ranked ninth for the night in the key demographic of viewers aged 18–49, with a Nielsen rating of 0.27. \\"Variable and Full of Perturbation\\" received mixed reviews from critics. Mark Rozeman, writing for Paste, gave the episode a rating of 6.9 out of 10 and, despite enjoying several storylines, described the introduction of Tony as \\"perhaps the biggest misstep in the show's brief history\\". He felt that the kiss between Tony and Felix was an example of \\"taboo-pushing gimmickry\\" and summarised the episode as \\"strange experimental tangent\\". Slant Magazine critic Matt Brennan found the episode \\"jumbled and strange\\" but felt that the introduction of Tony was a \\"delightful twist\\". He said that Cosima's storyline taking place at the Dyad Institute felt \\"dry and utilitarian, as though the writers realized they better get their shit together in time to wrap things up\\". The A.V. Club Caroline Framke gave the episode a C– grade and criticised the \\"chaotic script\\", \\"aggressively flashy direction\\" and the failed attempts to integrate the \\"wildly different\\" subplots. She admired the attempt to \\"shin[e] a light on a population that's often invisible in the media landscape\\" by introducing a transgender character, but thought that Tony's character was underdeveloped and \\"more like a prop than a character\\". Similarly, Adam W. Kepler of The New York Times felt that Tony was a cliché of trans men—\\"absolutely nothing [viewers] haven't seen before\\"—whose characterisation was overly simplistic. Although Chris Jancelewicz of The Huffington Post found Tony's character dull, he wrote in response to Maslany's portrayal of him: \\"Gift-wrap that Golden Globe, Hollywood Foreign Press. There are no other Best TV Actress contenders this year.\\" He praised the \\"touching\\" scenes shared by Cosima with Delphine and Scott and the \\"entertaining and twisted\\" bonding between Alison and Donnie. IGN's Eric Goldman felt that introducing Tony was a \\"big leap\\" for the show but that it paid off, largely due to Maslany's performance, and enjoyed the storylines featuring Alison, Cosima and Rachel. Vlada Gelman wrote for TVLine that Maslany's performance as Tony in \\"Variable and Full of Perturbation\\" was proof that \\"there [isn't] anything Tatiana Maslany can't do\\". Conversely, Rob Hunter of Film School Rejects felt that her portrayal of Tony provided \\"proof that Maslany is human after all and capable of failure\\".

Thomas was a father of seven children living in Troy, New York, when, in September 2008, his four-month-old son died. A preliminary medical examination indicated that the infant died from head trauma. The police interrogated Thomas for nearly 10 hours during which he confessed to throwing his son on the bed three times. The entire interrogation was videotaped. He was charged with second-degree murder, found guilty, and sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. In 2011, Grover Babcock and Blue Hadaegh were looking for an example of a coerced confession as the basis for a documentary film they were planning and they used Thomas' interrogation video to make the documentary Scenes of a Crime. Thomas appealed his conviction based on a coercive interrogation. However, the state appellate justices of New York denied his appeal in 2012. Thomas then appealed his conviction to the New York Court of Appeals. In February 2014, the seven judges unanimously ruled that Thomas must have another trial excluding the videotaped confession. A second trial was held and on June 12, 2014, the jury found him not guilty of second degree murder of his infant son. The case created controversy about how much coercion is legally permissible in police interrogations. Background In September 2008, Thomas was 26 years old, unemployed, and the father of seven children living in Troy, New York. According to his relatives, he moved to Troy from Douglas, Georgia, after he married Wilhelmina Hicks. On September 23, 2008, Thomas' son Mathew Thomas, who was approximately four months old and had previously been pronounced brain dead in a hospital in Troy, died in Albany Medical Center Hospital. A doctor at the hospital told police that Mathew died of head injuries that he had sustained. Because of the doctor's report, police began questioning Thomas about the circumstances of his son's death, claiming that an adult must have physically hurt his son: specifically, either Thomas or his wife. Thomas initially denied that he had done anything to his son that could have caused his head injuries. Towards the end of a nearly 10-hour interrogation however, Thomas continued to claim innocence but stated he would take the blame if something had accidentally happened to the child. As police continued to press for responses that fit with a physical injury, Thomas confessed to throwing Mathew on to the bed three times and the interrogation ended. He told police he had been fighting with his wife and had thrown his son on the bed out of frustration. He then signed a confession. First trial Despite a subsequent medical examination in which the same doctor who had initially reported to police that Thomas' son had died of head trauma, found no evidence of a skull fracture and determined the cause of death to be sepsis, Thomas' trial for second degree murder began in October 2009. The prosecution built their case around the videotaped confession Thomas gave police. They showed the jury the taped demonstration of Thomas throwing an object on the floor to illustrate how he threw his son onto the bed. This was the first time a videotaped confession had been shown to a jury in Rensselaer County, New York. In his testimony to the jury, Thomas told the jurors that the admissions of guilt he made during the interrogation were all lies. He said he told the police that he weighed when he actually weighed . He also denied hitting his son's head with his head, hitting his son's head against the rail of the crib, and throwing his son on the bed three times. He said that he lied to the police during the interrogation because the police kept repeating that he had injured his son and because he wanted to get out of the interrogation so that he could go to the hospital and see his son and wife. On October 22, 2009, Professor Richard Ofshe, an expert on false confessions during police interrogations, testified at a hearing that after reviewing the taped confession, he concluded that Thomas' confession fit his model of false confessions. However, after hearing the testimony of Professor Paul Cassell who stated that there was little empirical evidence to backup Ofshe's theory of false confessions, Judge Andrew Ceresia denied the defense's request to call Ofshe to testify. The jury subsequently found Thomas guilty of second degree murder and judge Andrew Ceresia sentenced Thomas to 25 years to life in prison. Scenes of a Crime Grover Babcock and Blue Hadaegh are independent documentary producers. They were interested in the phenomena of false confessions during police interrogations. They wanted to document with a real case the kind of interrogation process that could produce false confessions. They began searching for video of an entire police interrogation, which turned out to be difficult to find until they came across the videotape of Thomas' confession. They subsequently produced a documentary film, Scenes of a Crime, using video from the Thomas interrogation to illustrate what can happen during police interrogations. Appeals Thomas' appeal was mainly based on the interrogation techniques used. On March 22, 2012, the state appellate justices of New York denied Thomas' appeal. They concluded The appeal then moved to the New York Court of Appeals. On February 20, 2014, the seven-member appeals court unanimously ruled that Thomas' interrogation went too far and that the videotaped confession should not have been shown to the jury. Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman who wrote for the majority concluded that \\"What transpired during defendant’s interrogation was not consonant with, and indeed completely undermined, defendant’s right not to incriminate himself—to remain silent\\". They ordered a new trial and ruled that the taped confession could not be shown to the jury. Second trial On May 27, 2014, the second trial for Thomas, now 32 years old, began, again with a charge of second degree murder of his infant son. Because the videotaped interrogation was inadmissible in the second trial, much of the prosecution and defense testimony focused was on the cause of death of four-month-old Mathew Thomas. Rensselaer County Medical Examiner Dr. Michael Sikirica told the jury that the infant had subdural hematomas, which are often cause in infants by head injuries resulting from violent shaking. Chicago specialist Dr. Jan Leestma told the jury that the infant died of septic shock due to a bacterial infection. Child abuse expert Dr. Patrick Barnes told the jury that the CT scans that he examined of brain swelling and blood on the brain of the infant were old and could have occurred at child birth. He told the jury that the infant was born premature and was also a twin, which placed him at greater risk for bleeding of the brain. In closing arguments, Rensselaer County Assistant District Attorney Christa Book argued that Thomas bounced the infant on the bed until he fell on the ground causing head trauma, which killed him. Defense attorney Steve Coffey countered that Dr. Edge, who treated the infant at the hospital did not testify and neither did neuroradiologist Dr. Hoover. Coffey suggested to the jury that they did not testify because the prosecution did not like what they had to say. Book objected to Coffey's suggestions saying that they were \\"ridiculous,\\" but her objections were overruled by Judge Andrew Ceresia. Defense attorney Coffey also questioned the testimony of convicted felon William Terry who testified that Thomas had confessed to him while they were both in prison. Finally, Coffey reminded the jury that despite hearing terms such as \\"wicked, evil, inhuman, brutal, despicable, wanton\\" during the trial, they had to be convinced by the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt to find Thomas guilty. Jurors deliberated for approximately seven hours spread over two days before returning a verdict. On June 12, 2014, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. According to Thomas' defense attorney, Thomas was \\"stunned\\" by the verdict. Assistant District Attorney Christa Book said after the trial that \\"I'm sorry that I could not bring Matthew justice.\\" One of the jurors said after the trial: \\"We were trying to grasp that we could not use stuff that was not allowable but we all agreed in the end he was not guilty based on what we had in front of us.\\" After the verdict was returned, his family members said that he planned to return to Douglas, Georgia, and for a welcome home party. On June 15, 2014, he reunited with his family in Georgia. Controversy The controversy over this case revolves around the interrogation technique police used to get a confession out of Thomas. The technique is called the Reid technique. The Reid technique is a nine-step procedure followed by most police agencies in the United States. The technique begins by confronting the suspect with guilt, offering the suspect a reason for why he or she committed the crime, followed by various techniques of applying psychological pressure to get the suspect to confess and ultimately obtaining a written confession. The New York Court of Appeals ruled in Thomas' case that the extent to which police lied and used coercion during an interrogation went too far, but their ruling did not lay out criteria for how much coercion is too much. According to a CBS Channel 6 report, this will lead police agencies across the state of New York to revise their interrogation protocols. Grover Babcock, in an interview with NPR argued that limits on coercive interrogations are important because they elicit too many false confessions. He stated that the Innocence Project has exonerated many people through DNA testing and that of those exonerated, about 25% to 30% had given false confessions.

As of 2017 it remained trading, though it had entered receivership the previous year. History A Pie Face store at Sydney Airport in 2017 Pie Face was established in 2003, and rapidly expanded. After opening a number of stores in Australia, it established stores in New York City during 2012 and New Zealand in late 2013. At its peak the chain had 80 stores in Australia and the United States, and planned to open a further 100 worldwide.

In November 2014 Pie Face entered voluntary administration, facing legal action both in Australia and the US. Prior to entering administration it had been considering a stock market listing to be valued at $150 million, and had agreements to establish stores in Asia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The firm secured financing in December 2014, enabling it to continue trading. However, its focus was shifted mainly to wholesale and retail sales. Large numbers of company-owned and franchised stores closed as result, with the loss of hundreds of jobs. Pie Face went in receivership again in late 2016, and closed eleven company-owned stores. As at 24 November 2016 approximately 26 franchised stores remained open. In January 2017 it was reported that the chain was nearing profitability, and now had 30 franchised stores and intended to expand overseas again with a focus on Japan and South Korea. However, it continued to have debts of $9 million, including $1 million owed to staff, and was facing a motion to be wound up for unpaid debts. At this time its receivers told the media that unsecured creditors were unlikely to receive any funds, but they believed the business had significant \\"growth potential, if properly managed\\" and seven or eight companies were considering purchasing the chain. All the New Zealand outlets had closed by the end of 2017. In April 2017, it was acquired by United Petroleum for an undisclosed sum.

Romance of the Three Kingdoms was translated by Dahai. Dahai translated Wanbao quanshu 萬寶全書. Hong Taiji sponsored the translations of many Chinese language histories and classics in his newly declared Qing dynasty. The majority of literary works in Manchu during the Qing dynasty consisted of officially sanctioned translations of Chinese Confucian classics and political works, and later translations of Chinese novels and texts on medicine, history, religion.Norman 2003, pp. 485-6. There were few Manchu archetypal literary works.ed. Idema 2007, p. 211. The German sinologist Eric Hauer argued that the Manchu translations of Chinese classics and fiction were done by experts familiar with their original meaning and with how best to express it in Manchu. Because Manchu is easy to learn, these translations enable the student to use the Manchu versions of the classics to verify the meaning of the Chinese text, for instance, the Manchu translation of the Peiwen yunfu or the language of difficult Chinese novels, such as Jin Ping Mei. Most original material produced in Manchu were histories and documentary texts relating to military and foreign affairs on the northern frontiers which were handled by the Lifan Yuan, such as campaigns against the Dzungars. Many Chinese medical texts were translated into Manchu under the Qianlong Emperor.Hanson 2003, p. 114.

Chinese history, Chinese law, and Chinese military theory classical texts were translated into Manchu during the rule of Hong Taiji in Mukden with Manchus placing significance upon military and governance related Chinese texts.

Its extent of occurrence is estimated to be only 1,500 km2, and is considered to be endangered. It is listed as endangered because of its very limited range within 1,500 km2, and its further decline of habitat will cause the population to fall since it is only found in the cloud forests. It is also traded illegally in the pet trade. The apparent threat to A. fimbriata's habitat is from agriculture and the exportation of ornamental Chamaedaphne calyculata plants to Japan and Europe. Conservation efforts are being made to save A. fimbriata. It can be found in several protected areas such as Biotopo Universitario Mario Dary Rivera and Reserva de Biosfera Sierra de Las Minas and several private reserves.

It belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies in the Diocese of Visby.  History and architecture  Interior, view of the choir Boge Church is an early Gothic church. The oldest parts are the choir and the sacristy, dating from the mid-13th century. The nave is somewhat later, and replaced an earlier, Romanesque nave; this explains why the nave is unusually short and wide, as it was squeezed in between an existing tower and the choir. The tower seen today however dates from 1867–92, as the old tower collapsed during a storm in 1857. On this occasion, the nave was also severely damaged, but likewise later reconstructed. Externally, the church is supported by a single buttress, erected after the storm in 1857 to stabilise the church. The main portal is somewhat later than the rest of the building, and dates from the mid-14th century. Its capitals are decoratively sculpted. Internally, the church is decorated with two sets of medieval murals dating from the construction period and the mid-15th century, respectively. The later ones are in the style of the so-called Master of the Passion of Christ. Most of the furnishings date from the 18th century, with the exception of the baptismal font (13th century) and a large, medieval iron chandelier.

The Formation was established in April 1999 and mandated to provide, maintain and sustain landward common training to the SA Army. History of Military Training in South Africa =Dutch East India Company= The Dutch East India Company in 1786 established a training centre in South Africa for military cadets, from the local population. However, the school did not reach the stage where it functioned properly, owing to the financial difficulties and eventual collapse of the Dutch East India Company. =Union of South Africa= After Union in 1910, Chapter IV of the South Africa Defence Act, 1912, made provision for the South African Military College. In the Annual Reports of the Department of Defence and Executive Commands for the year ended 30 June 1913, the College was referred to as \\"an institution or group of institutions, known as the South African Military Schools.\\" The report added that the institution \\".At first the only branches of the College which were in existence were: * the General Branch (styled the South African Military School) and * the Musketry Branch (called the South African School of Musketry). The S.A. Military School was established on 1 July 1912 at the Old Presidency in Bloemfontein. On the same date, a class of 51 officers assembled there to attend a course. The Old Presidency had been selected to accommodate the Military School until such time as buildings, which were more suitable, became available at Tempe. On 1 April 1913, the S.A. School of Musketry was opened at Tempe and the first course, for rifle instructors, began on the 13th of that month. The School of Musketry later became the nucleus of the Weapon Training Branch of the College. The arrangement, whereby the schools were situated a distance from each other, proved to be impractical. As a result, the various training establishments in the Bloemfontein area were transferred to Tempe on 1 January 1914 and placed under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel P. C. B. Skinner. It was composed of: * a School of General Military Instruction, * a School of Musketry, * a School of Signalling and * a Medical Training School. =First World War= Following the outbreak of the First World War, the establishment at Tempe was closed and the staff transferred to the mobilisation camp at Potchefstroom early in 1915. During the war years, they were employed in training specialists and volunteers for service with the overseas contingents. =Interwar Years= In 1920, the College was re-established in the now familiar stone building at Roberts Heights (now Thaba Tshwane) and designated the South African Military School. Colonel W. E. C. Tanner, CB, CMG, DSO, was the Commandant. On re- establishment, the School consisted of the \\"G' Branch, the Musketry Branch, the Signals Branch and a Training Depot. After March 1920, the real development of the College took place. By June of that year, military training was in full swing. In 1923, a significant step was taken when 12 cadets commenced a course for commissions in the South African Permanent Force. As a result, college status could not be withheld from the Military School and, on 1 July 1924, it became the South African Military College. A second course for Permanent Force cadets began on 6 August 1924. Another course for Army cadets of the Permanent Force commenced in 1929. This course was amalgamated with an Air Force cadet course early in 1930, after it had been decided that cadets would in future receive combined training for service in the Infantry, Artillery and the Air Force. This training system continued until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. This policy of combined training resulted in the appearance among South African officers of individuals who sported both spurs (horse gunners) and wings. In 1923, the Imperial Government provided well-qualified instructors for a series of courses in Physical and Recreational Training. These efforts did not meet with success and physical training was relegated to the background. In 1936 and 1937, a deputation was sent to Europe to investigate the matter. As a result, the Physical Training Branch was established on 1 May 1938. =Second World War= War broke out on 3 September 1939, giving the College its first experience of training soldiers under conditions of conflict. From June 1939 to June 1940, 9 170 students passed through the College, while at the peak period (in March 1942) there were 1 800 students of all ranks on courses. During the war, about 150 000 men of all ranks passed through the College. The Commando Training Branch was transferred in 1940 and the Armour Branch shortly afterwards. In 1940, the Signals Branch moved from the College to Potchefstroom, where it became the Signals Training Centre, this name being changed to the School of Signals in 1944. The School of Signals again became a branch of the College in 1946 and, in January 1947, it was once more moved to Potchefstroom where it became a branch of the School of Artillery and Armour. The Chemical Warfare and the Concealment and Camouflage Branches were disbanded in 1945. In April 1945, the Regimental Training Branch became incorporated with the Weapon Training Branch. =Post War Years= The Administration and Ordnance Branch was established on 19 July 1950. In the same year, the Defence Force Academy Branch was established. In collaboration with the University of Pretoria, this branch undertook academic training of both Army and Air Force cadets. The joint training of Army and Air Force cadets at the College was terminated on the establishment of the Air Force College on 7 December 1951. In the second half of 1953, provision was made for the Weapon Training Branch to be renamed the Infantry School. This School remained an integral part of the College and its first establishment table was set in January 1954. On 31 May 1956, the Minister of Justice, Mr. C. R. Swart, presented the College with its Regimental Colour. About 400 men, representing 78 Citizen Force units, took part in the parade which accompanied the presentation ceremony. Major-General H. B. Klopper, DSO, Inspector General, and Brigadier P. H. Grobbelaar, uso, Army Chief-of-Staff, were on the saluting base with the Minister of Justice. The Trooping was done by four guards of 66 men each, with the Army Band providing the music. The Colour Ensign was Lieutenant C. J. Lloyd. Padré John A. Gurney, consecrated the Colour which was then lodged in the officers' mess at the College. Since the College has no battle honours, none appears on the Colour. The tassel and fringe are of gold braiding. The background is the same as that of the national flag - orange, white and blue bands of equal width. The College badge, a wildebeest, is embroidered on a blue background on the white hand of the Colour and is encircled by two laurels of pink proteas with green leaves. The motto \\"Paratus\\" is embroidered in gold on a scroll of old gold below the unit badge. On 1 March 1968, the Chief of the Army, Lieutenant- General W. P. Louw, SM, announced that it had been decided to change the name of the South African Military College to the South African Army College. At the same time, the title of Commandant of the Military College was abolished and the title of Officer Commanding, South African Army College, introduced. Structure The Training Formation consists of the following units: SANDF Army Training Formation structure * 3 SAI Training Depot - basic soldiering skills to all recruits * SA Army Combat Training Centre - the Army practical training ground * South African Army Gymnasium - leader training * South African Army College - command and management training for senior leaders Basic military training South African Army recruits undergo 22 weeks of basic military training (BMT), up from 14 weeks in 2005. BMT is the first of a series of training periods undertaken at the SA Army Training Depot in Kimberley. The BMT programme consists of 600 40-minute instructional periods, allocated to Fitness, Drill, Combat skills, Musketry, Shooting Exercises, Fieldcraft, Map Reading, Command Information, Political Science, SANDF & SA Army organisation, \\"Know your Enemy\\", Military Security, Chaplain's periods, Regimental duties, Standing Orders, Loss control, Guards and sentries, Military law, Hygiene, Buddy Aid, Conditioning training, Combat PT, Recreational PT, Parade drill, Compliments and saluting, Musketry and Weapons drill, Field exercises and route marches, as well as Basic mine awareness. =Fieldcraft= Field craft includes an emphasis on navigation (including maintaining direction in the bush) and map reading. Also focussed on is the use of a compass, orientating by using the sun and stars; camouflage and concealment – both of the individual and of fighting positions and bivouacs; stalking; observation and judging distance: all of this by day and night. The \\"bush lane\\" simulates conditions in the African Bushveld. A recruit is expected to walk up a specially laid-out path and identify and engage a variety of targets concealed along the way – using lessons drawn from fieldcraft. Instructors may also add tripwires, etc. to add to the realism and exercise knowledge acquired during the mine awareness lessons. =Musketry= Musketry training includes work on the shooting range and along the \\"bush lane\\", but is preceded by many hours mastering the maintenance and cleaning of the R4 service rifle. By the end of basic training, a recruit is expected to be able to shoot a 200mm group at 100m in prone and kneeling positions and, in the standing position, from 50m. =Fitness= Fitness is a basic requirement for soldiering, in addition to conditioning training and combat PT, usually conducted in uniform and boots, with an R4; recruits are also exposed to ever- longer route marches. By the end of basic training, the recruit should be able to complete a 25 km route march, bearing a rifle and 25 kg pack, in four-and- a-half hours. They will also be able to do 50 push-ups in two minutes, 60 sit- ups and 10 pull-ups, sequentially, within the same time-frame. After this they should be able to run 2.4 km, with rifle and battle jacket within 12 minutes. =Buddy Aid= Buddy aid concentrates on teaching each recruit the skills needed to render immediate first aid to a wounded or injured comrade. Problems covered include identifying and dealing with cardiac arrest, impeded breathing, snakebite, bleeding, burns, heat exhaustion, fractures and open wounds. Formation Specific Training Each type Formation receives its recruits after BMT and starts to train these individuals in specialized training relative to that Formation e.g.: * School of Signals * School of Armour * School of Artillery * School of Air Defence * Infantry School * Special Forces School * School of Logistics Support * Intelligence School =Example: Infantry Formation Training= For the Infantry Formation, this normally means at the Infantry School, where training commences with two weeks familiarisation training on the weapons found in a rifle platoon other than the R4. This includes training on pyrotechnics and flares, shrapnel mines, hand and rifle grenades, the 60mm patrol mortar, the RPG7 recoilless rocket launcher, the general purpose machine gun (FN MAG or Denel SS77) and the multiple 40mm grenade launcher. This phase may also include familiarisation with night vision equipment. Once mastered, a rifleman is next schooled on conventional operations, with an emphasis on section battle drills and trench routine. This entails spending many a night digging and occupying trench lines and posting sentries. Full defensive fire plans, including all platoon weapons, will also be executed. A rifleman is introduced to the art of patrolling and laying ambushes – skills equally useful on the conventional battlefield as during counterinsurgency campaigns and for peace support. Also practiced are vehicle movement, countermine and defile drills and procedures for occupying covert temporary bases. Section Leader Training Concurrent with specialised training, those willing, and fitting the profile, are selected and trained as section leaders. Those passing the six-week course are appointed lance corporals. Most will be promoted to substantive corporals after a successful trial period. Leadership Training Leadership training is presented at the SA Army Gymnasium at Heidelberg, advanced leader training at the corps schools as well as at the SA Army College at Thaba Tshwane. Senior Army leaders receive training at the War and Defence Colleges. SA Army College =Joint Senior Command and Staff Programme= JSCSP is a 44 – week residential programme, held at the South Africa National War College, is aimed at preparing selected officers for senior appointments at the operational level of war by developing their command, staff and analytical skills through broadening their professional understanding of joint and multinational operations, defence management and the wider aspects of conflict. =Military Research= The Military Academy at Saldanha Bay is the academic training centre for the three arms of the National Defence Force. Joint Warfare Training Conventional combined Formation force training is conducted at the SA Army Combat Training Centre at Lohatlha in the Northern Cape and airborne force training at De Brug near Bloemfontein. Joint Services Training All Services, Army, Air Force, Navy and Medical Services eventually combine in Joint Training exercises.

Rällingsberg mining area (Swedish: Rällingsbergs gruvor) is an area with four defunct iron mines outside the community of Långshyttan in the parish of Husby in Hedemora Municipality, Dalarna County, Sweden. The former mining area now forms part of the Husbyringen nature and culture trail.  History  The mining field was discovered in 1841 by farmworker, Clas Westerholm. With a borrowed mining compass he found a wide-spread magnetic field east of Lake Rällingen near a piece of farmland called Gruvvreten (swedish for mining field). He got his claim registered January 30, 1841 and became half-owner of the prospect together with the owner of Kloster’s Mill (Klosters bruk). In June the same year a contract was made on mining in what was to become Rällingsbergsgruvan. After six years Westerholm was bought out of the mine for 8 000 kronor, but about 35 years later a second payment was made of the sum 5 000 kronor, since he had spent all his money and was rendered poor. In 1871 the owners of the ironworks started the stock company Klosters AB and in 1892 Rällingsbergs gruvaktiebolag was formed as a daughter company. Klosters AB established a narrow-track railway in 1891 for its cargo between the use at Långshyttan and Stjernsund. The ore in the mine had a high quantity of manganese and was suitable for bessemer iron that was produced in the new blast furnace at Klosterverken in Långshyttan (Klosterverken Långshyttan) from 1861 (with an interruption 1864–1868).Söderlund & Attman (1958), sid 336 To have access to its own ore reduced the cost of the company at Kloster considerably, partly compensating for the lack of own charcoal.Söderlund & Attman (1958), sid 348 Rällingsberg mine received electric power from 1918. The mines were run until 1932. Husbyringen Husbyringen was opened in 1970 by the Husbyrgen Foundation (Stiftelsen Husbyringen and claims to be Sweden's first ecomuseum. Around the 6 km long nature and cultural trail are 30 attractions related to the Rällingsberg mining area, Kloster ironworks and Långshyttan ironworks. Today, the former dynamite house, mining house, machine shop, sorting house, and electric transformer substation remain at the site.

Hill, as they raced to build routes up the Deschutes River canyon, connecting the mainlines along the Columbia River to the new markets of Central Oregon. Harriman's Des Chutes Railroad Company built the house to the Union Pacific Common Standard Plan for buildings (with allowed variations) in 1910. It was one of three buildings in the \\"country combination station\\" at Maupin, and served as residence for the maintenance of way foreman for the local section of track. The other two buildings of the station (a depot and a bunk residence for the maintenance crew) were demolished by 1968. Most of the Des Chutes Railroad tracks in the canyon were abandoned in 1936, granting Hill the final victory in the race. The road passing in front of the house utilizes the former railroad grade.. The Bureau of Land Management acquired the house in 1968. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2006..

It is one of the more well-preserved Romanesque churches on Gotland, and contains both a number of medieval furnishings as well medieval murals. Buttle Church belongs to the Diocese of Visby of the Church of Sweden. History and architecture Buttle Church interior Buttle Church is one of the more well-preserved Romanesque churches on Gotland. The oldest parts are the western part of the choir and the nave, dating from the second half of the 12th century. The tower was added circa 1220. An original apse was pulled down during the middle of the 14th century and replaced by the present structure with a straight east end, in Gothic style. The only later additions are the windows of the nave, which were made in 1882-83. Inside, the church is decorated with medieval murals. In the nave, a damaged frieze displaying the Passion of Christ can be seen, while in the tower base there are a set of paintings depicting Saint George and the Dragon, Saint Martin of Tours and a scene in which souls are being weighed. All the paintings in the church have been attributed to the Master of the Passion of Christ (Passionsmästaren) or his workshop. The church retains several medieval furnishings. The triumphal cross is one of the earliest of its kind on Gotland, dating from the end of the 12th century. It was probably made by a local artist but shows influences from German art from the period. The altarpiece is also medieval, from the 15th century, and still in its original place. The altarpiece displays carved wooden figures depicting the crucifixion and a number of saints. It was renovated in 1956-57. The baptismal font is also noteworthy, from the middle of the 13th century. Its base is decorated with sculpted heads of humans and beasts. The pews are in a vernacular Baroque style. In the 1950s they were restored to their original colour scheme. They were probably decorated by the same artist who worked in Vänge Church. The church today belongs to the Church of Sweden and lies within the Diocese of Visby.
