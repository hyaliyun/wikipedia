He said he didn't get much of an education and worked on cattle stations, riding horses and branding cows, before joining the Army at 18.  World War II Service  Shaw joined the Australian Army in 1964 and he served in the Indonesian- Malaysia confrontation where he spent 18 months with the 4th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment; stationed just north of Malacca. Because he was a regular in the Army he was then sent back home to join the 2nd Royal Australian Regiment when Australia became involved in the Vietnam War. In between these two deployments he was given just one week's leave to visit Alice Springs to see his family before travelling to Vietnam on HMAS Sydney. One day, when on patrol in Vietnam, Shaw cut his thumb through to the bone on his machete and was sent back to Australia for, what was ultimately, three operations and multiple skin grafts. Following this injury, and the 6 months spent to recover, Shaw was transferred to the 9th Battalion where he became section Commander and, later, Acting Platoon Sergeant. While in the 9th Battalion Shaw met other Aboriginal men from Alice Springs who were serving in Vietnam; including Richard Tilmouth, Charlie Tilmouth, Kenny Laughton, Linton Espey and David Miller and thought it was amazing that six Aboriginal men from Alice Springs (including himself) where serving nearby noting that it was a \\"fairly big contingent when you work out the percentage of Aboriginal people who went to Vietnam\\".  Later career  Following his return to Alice Springs Shaw moved in to Mount Nancy Town Camp and has worked for, led and helped establish many Aboriginal organisations, including Tangentyere Council where he was once the president and Central Land Council where he was a deputy chair. Shaw was also the first ATSIC Commissioner for Central Australia. Becoming involved in community organisations has saved Shaw, who has struggled with PTSD since his war service. Shaw has also been vocal in his opposition to the 2007 Northern Territory National Emergency Response; more commonly called 'The Intervention'. A part of this intervention is that Aboriginal communities and town camps became 'dry-zones' meaning that Shaw is probably the only Digger who is breaking the law if he had his mates around for ANZAC Day.

Having fought an inconclusive battle there the previous month, Walker again aimed to capture the valuable fortified town. The assault and subsequent siege of the town was inconclusive, as the heavy losses suffered on both sides still did not produce a definitive result, with Walker‚Äôs men withdrawing back to Granada after three days and nights of fighting. This loss drove Walker to not only abandon his vulnerable capital at Granada, but also to burn it to the ground.  Background  After the unsuccessful First Battle of Masaya in October, Walker knew that an enemy force encamped so nearby made his position in Granada untenable. After driving Jose Maria Ca√±as out of La Virgen at the Battle of the Transit on November 11, and with the return of the experienced General Charles Frederick Henningsen to his force, Walker felt confident in his victorious army's ability to retake Masaya. Walker and his men embarked from La Virgen to Granada, there mustering 550 men. On the morning of the 15th, Walker and this force set off in the direction of Masaya. However, halfway to their destination, Walker received news that 800 men under General M√°ximo Jerez had departed Masaya in order to reinforce Ca√±as‚Äô defeated army at Rivas. This newly mobile force threatened the transit link under Walker‚Äôs control, so Walker peeled off 200 men with orders to reinforce the garrison left to man the recently captured transit city of La Virgen. Left at this point with only 350 men, Walker inexplicably decided to carry on with the assault on Masaya. As explained by Daniel Bedinger Lucas, Walker‚Äôs ‚Äúmania for assaulting fortified towns with an inferior force‚Äù is what motivated the decision to attack. Whatever the reason, on the 15th of November, Walker‚Äôs force arrived at Masaya. General Charles Frederick Henningsen  Battle  Walker‚Äôs men assaulted the town, this time supported by constant fire from the artillery commanded by General Henningsen. Just as had happened during the battle at Masaya in October, Walker‚Äôs men quickly captured the small plaza of San Sebastian, but after vicious fighting, were halted mere yards from the city‚Äôs central plaza. By this point, one third of Walker‚Äôs command had been killed or wounded, and inconclusive fighting raged for the next two days. By midnight of the 17th, Walker had concluded that not only had losses been too costly in the assault, but that too much valuable time had been lost. Walker and his men thus lifted the siege and quietly retired back to Granada.  Aftermath  Walker and his remaining 200 men were able to return unmolested back to Granada, presumably because the Central American forces had also taken serious losses and were in no position to pursue Walker‚Äôs army. It was after this costly battle that Walker made the decision to abandon and destroy Granada, relating to Henningsen his intentions after re-entering the city on the 18th.

Refugee workforce integration  Refugees are often faced with under-employment, unemployment and employment in informal economy. In this sense, many researchers and practitioners call for not just simple refugee employment, but a successful refugee workforce integration. Refugee workforce integration is understood to be a process in which refugees engage in economic activities (employment or self-employment), which are commensurate with individuals' professional goals and previous qualifications and experience, and provide adequate economic security and prospects for career advancement. It is ideal that refugee-receiving countries aim to facilitate refugee workforce integration, looking after the whole process in order to help refugees be self-sustainable, instead of merely promoting refugee employment, which may lead to short-term and unsustainable economic outcomes. That is, in understanding refugee employment and workforce integration, contextual settings around refugees' destination countries play a vital role. = Canvas ceiling = Canvas ceiling is a metaphor used to capture a multitude of barriers affecting refugee workforce integration (cf. glass ceiling and bamboo ceiling). The notion of the ceiling is used to illuminate the limits that a particular social group encounters in their career journey. Canvas ceiling encompasses institutional-, organizational- and individual-level challenges that refugees encounter in accessing and advancing quality employment within the receiving society. Refugee workforce integration is especially difficult to facilitate due to the interplay of various factors across multiple levels (i.e. institutional, organizational and individual- level factors). That is, refugees experience interrelated effects of compound challenges that they must overcome in order to achieve adequately remunerated and commensurate employment with prospects for professional advancement. These challenges span around: immigration regulations, qualifications accreditation and education, socio-political climate, employers, self-employment related issues, support organizations' operations and management, individual demographics, language, social networks, psychological responses, and motivation of individual refugees.  Refugee employment agreements  145 countries have signed the Convention relating to the Status of RefugeesUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (2015) States Parties to the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol.

In countries that have signed the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees, refugees are entitled to gainful employment under Chapter 3UNHCR (2019a) UNHCR - Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Available at: https://www.unhcr.org/3b66c2aa10 (Accessed: 4 November 2019).. Three articles in Chapter 3 pertain to the employment of refugees. * Article 17 requires that countries should give refugees the same rights to employment as citizens and exempt refugees from restrictions applied to foreigners if they fulfill one of the following conditions: ** He has completed three years‚Äô residence in the country; ** He has a spouse possessing the nationality of the country of residence. A refugee may not invoke the benefits of this provision if he has abandoned his spouse; ** He has one or more children possessing the nationality of the country of residence. * Article 18 states that refugees are allowed the same rights to self-employment as foreigners in the country. * Article 19 allows for refugees with diplomas that are recognized by the authorities of the state should be accorded the same treatment as foreigners in the country. Various countries may also have additional requirements or laws to gain employment. It can still be difficult for refugees to gain legal employment even in countries that have signed the convention. Individuals usually need to have refugee status before they are allowed to gain employment. Countries usually have their own asylum processes to accord refugee status.

On the overall, it would lead to improved standards of living. Hiring refugees can benefit businesses too.

The host country usually also benefits as refugees gain legal employment, it helps to grow the economy and increase the tax base.

Y. (2019) ‚ÄòThe Economic Impact of Granting Refugees in Malaysia the Right to Work‚Äô. Available at: www.ideas.org.my.. This happens through various mechanisms, including increased consumer spending from refugees who have improved incomes. Correspondingly, the growth of the economy is also expected to create new jobs. This is particularly as refugees tend to fill lower value jobs which are usually also jobs that locals shun in developed countries. This makes businesses more productive and creates industry growth. It also encourages locals to specialize and upgrade to higher value jobs. Where refugees are allowed to start businesses, they also create jobs that employ locals.

Refugees are often unable to find employment due to a lack of information on the opportunities in the host country.

Employed refugees are at risk of exploitation, particularly in countries where they lack legal access to employment. This tends to be exacerbated partly because they lack knowledge of the home country‚Äôs laws and their rights.

Employers may also be hesitant to employ refugees because they are unclear about the refugee employment laws in their countries and consequently take the conservative approach of not hiring refugees. Other challenges include a lack of clarity of the duration of stay of the refugees and a mismatch of skills from the employer and the refugees. Companies often also do not see a business case for hiring refugees. Many view hiring refugees as a Corporate Social Responsibility obligation rather than being beneficial to the businessOECD and UNHCR (2016) Hiring refugees-What are the opportunities and challenges for employers?..

The population was smaller than that of nearby Arbacoochee (which was also formed after gold was found nearby), but considered by locals to be a more permanent town due to the greater number of brick buildings. Local lore held that the King brothers, (who later founded King Ranch), were prospectors in the area. Remains of some of the mines are located on the Frank Spain Scout Reservation, where participating Scouts are able to learn about the history of the area.

Political career As Prefect of the St. Petersburg Police, in 1901, Kleigels had led the police in disbanding student protests, which resulted in 62 dead students. Professor N. Belelubsky, of the Institute of Engineers, had written a public protest against Kleigels, which was published and read: \\"The events which took place in the Kazan Square represent the saddest and bitterest event in the life of the metropolis and of Russian society...\\" In 1902, Kleigels embezzled funds from the Fire Brigade of St. Petersburg, and avoided prosecution only because of the Tsar acting on his behavior against Lopoukine, the Public Prosecutor. The only thing he is credited with that reflects positively on him, is that he allegedly discovered a bomb-making plot by revolutionaries working on a barge in one of the canals of Kiev. Normally, someone with this checkered history would be overlooked, but he had caught the eye of the tsar, who recommended him to everyone, and in 1903, he was nominated to the post of Governor-General of Kiev. Kleigels was dismissed from his post as chief of police of Saint Petersburg in 1905, because it was believed that he allowed pograms against Jews to go on, after a Jewish riot. During this event, Russian-Jewish citizens had torn down or otherwise attacked a statue of Tsar Nicholas I. When anti-Jewish pogroms sprung up, Kleigels simply had become \\"inactive\\" and had \\"abandoned his post,\\" according to Sergei Witte, Prime Minister of Russia. Kleigels' response was considered insufficient, and he was replaced by General Karass. In addition to this, when the 1905 Russian Revolution deprived the government of all power, Kleigels had been forced to partially-collaborate with revolutionary forces, allowing the establishment of societies of labor and unions. Between these two accusations, inaction during a Jewish pogrom and collaboration during the 1905 Revolution, he had gone too far for the officials of the imperial court. Kleigels had also tried to dissociate himself from the student movement, saying that he pitied them, and that he was surprised that so many people were influenced by a group of people who \\"attacked the police.\\" References Category:1850 births Category:1916 deaths Category:People from Saint Petersburg Category:Imperial Russian Army generals Category:Russian police chiefs Category:Russian military personnel of the Russo-Turkish War (1877‚Äì1878) Category:Burials at Novodevichy Cemetery (Saint Petersburg) Category:Recipients of the Gold Sword for Bravery Category:Mayors of places in the Russian Empire ","title":"Nikolai Kleigels"},{"id":"62283658","text":"Violeta Marasigan (1939-21 April 2000), better known by her nickname \\"Bullet\\", was a Filipino-American social worker and activist best known for helping establish the Filipino feminist organization GABRIELA and the released- political-detainees group SELDA; for her resistance against and eventual imprisonment under the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos; and for advocacy work in the San Francisco Bay Area, which focused on education for Filipino immigrant children, equal military benefits for Filipino American World War II veterans, the prevention of housing demolition that would affect elderly Filipinos, and racial slurs against Filipino women on American television. In recognition of her years of service to the Bay Area community, she was given the Unsung Heroes Award by KQED Public Broadcasting Co. in 1995. In November 2019 hers will be among the eleven names which will be added to the Wall of Remembrance of the Philippines' Bantayog ng Mga Bayani, which recognizes the heroes and martyrs that fought the Marcos dictatorship. Early life and education Violeta Marasigan was born in the Philippines, but migrated to the United States where she studied at San Francisco State College. Early Activism and the I-Hotel demolition Soon after graduation, she was hired as a social worker for the Multi-Service Center of the United Filipino Association (UFA) - an organization which had put together to protest the impending demolition of the I-Hotel in the old Manilatown community of San Francisco, California. Aside from her general participation in the cause of the UFA, her job specifically involved serving a number of retirees whom she fondly called manongs (an ilocano term of endearment for elder men). She was soon surprised to discover that these retirees were receiving only about half of their social security benefits every month. In response, she lobbied their caseworkers to make sure that the retirees receive their full benefits every month.  Activism in the Philippines (1971-1988)  When Marasigan and her and husband Pete came back to the Philippines in 1971, the country was in turmoil after Ferdinand Marcos' unprecedented spending to assure his win in the 1969 presidential elections triggered an economic collapse and massive social unrest. A year later, Marcos would declare Martial Law. Pete and Bullet Marasigan quickly got involved in activism against the Marcos regime. Bullet took up work with the family ministry National Council of Churches of the Philippines, and in that capacity, became well known for being present every time the council participated in a protest. The Marasigan home was raided by the regime's military forces in 1981, and Bullet was jailed for almost a year in Camp Crame under charges of subversion. Journalist Ma Ceres P. Doyo of the Philippine Daily Inquirer later recounted an anecdote which humorously claimed > \\"the reason Bullet was released was that the barrage of words and laughter > (that was subversive) she relentlessly unleashed became too much for her > jailers.\\" = Organizations = Between returning to the Philippines in 1971 and returning to the US in 1988, Bullet became one of the founders of the feminist coalition GABRIELA, and also helped organize SELDA, an association of released political detainees.Other organizations she co-founded include Asian Women in Theology (AWIT), and Kaiba, a women's political party.  Return to the US and continued activism  In 1988, the Marasigans returned to California, and Bullet continued to in her activist activities. She took up a post as district-wide social worker of the Veterans‚Äô Equity Center, as counselor and social worker for the West Bay Filipino Multi-Services and Asian American Recovery Services. She also participated in the campaign to re-open the Filipino Education Center.  Death  Bullet Marasigan died as a result of a car accident on the morning of Tuesday, April 18, 2000.  Legacy  In recognition of her years of service to the Bay Area community, she was given the Unsung Heroes Award by KQED Public Broadcasting Co. in 1995. In November 2019 hers will be among the eleven names which will be added to the Wall of Remembrance of the Philippines' Bantayog ng Mga Bayani, which recognizes the heroes and martyrs that fought the Marcos dictatorship.

He wrote for a newspaper in Dubuque, Iowa while he was an Iowa state representative. Williams later entered the military as a Confederate. Personal life Williams was the son of Virginia state legisator and slave owner Saml. C. Williams. He spent his early life in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, later moving to Dubuque, Iowa after graduating from the University of Virginia in 1857. Later that year, he became a part of the law firm that was owned by his brother in law John T. Lovell. Career Williams was elected as state representative as a Democrat. During this time, he was a correspondent for the newspaper Dubuque Herald. On January 1, 1860, Williams became part of the Iowa Legislature's Eighth General Assembly until January 12, 1862. In March 1861, his father called for Virginia to secede from the Union. In March 1862, Iowa Governor Samuel J. Kirkwood started a legislative session for Iowa's war effort. When a bill came to the United States House of Representatives that prevented rendering aid to rebels, Williams said a proposal that went further than the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, stating that it should be made illegal for Iowa citizens to even countenance the escape of fugitive slaves which would make a person's moral stance illegal. There were many objections and the issue was tabled. He wrote editorials for the Dubuque Herald and criticized Abraham Lincoln for suspending habeas corpus. On July 12, 1862, a crowd threatened that they would destroy the offices of the Dubuque Herald. Williams reportedly carried horse pistols so that he could defend the newspaper. He was elected to the Iowa Democratic National Convention, but he moved back to Virginia on the day it happened. Later life Williams entered the military as Confederate by recruiting troops for R. Preston Chew's Horse Artillery in the 7th Virginia Cavalry, in which he later became a lieutenant. He was later a Judge Advocate General in the Cavalry Corps, Army of Northern Virginia under J.E.B. Stuart and then later under Wade Hampton III. After the Civil War ended, Williams moved to Woodstock, Virginia in 1893 and married Cora De Novelle Pritchartt. They had a daughter named Nannie W. Williams. He practiced law at the firm Williams and Brothers and served in the state legislature for Virginia. He died on December 7, 1903.

Most notably, Santesso has published numerous works regarding surveillance in regards to literature and societal perceptions. His book, The Watchman in Pieces: Surveillance, Literature, and Liberal Personhood, which was cowritten with David Rosen, details the ways in which literature has shaped, and in turn been shaped by, surveillance and privacy practices since the Renaissance. Education Santesso is a native of Trail, British Columbia, and received his bachelor‚Äôs degree from the University of British Columbia. He then went on to receive his master‚Äôs degree from Queen's University, and later his doctorate in English, with a specialization in 17th and 18th-century literature, from the same institution. Career As a professor, Santesso currently works in the Georgia Institute of Technology‚Äôs School of Literature, Media, and Communication.

Santesso is the author and coeditor of several published books. His book The Watchman in Pieces: Surveillance, Literature, and Liberal Personhood, which was cowritten by David Rosen and awarded the James Russell Lowell Prize , details the relationship between surveillance and literature. In particular, it discusses how changes in observation strategies has impacted literature since the Renaissance. In this discussion, societal theories regarding surveillance and privacy are challenged. As Santesso and Rosen state, ‚Äúthe key challenges of contemporary surveillance‚Ä¶center on interpretation, empathy, and understanding the world as a tangle of competing narratives.‚Äù Literature, they argue, is the mode through which this line of thinking may be achieved. Santesso has discussed surveillance and privacy in many of his other works, as well. In ‚ÄúSchool Surveillance and Privacy‚Äù, a chapter form the book The Palgrave International Handbook of School Discipline, Surveillance, and Social Control, he examines the topic in relation to places of education. He has also discussed surveillance issues in relation to J.R.R. Tolkien, such as in the Slate article ‚ÄúThe Eye of Sauron Is the Modern Surveillance State‚Äù, cowritten with Rosen. In addition to detailing issues of surveillance, Santesso has written many pieces regarding authors and themes presented in 17th and 18th-century literature. In his book A Careful Longing: The Poetics and Problems of Nostalgia, he discusses modern conceptions of nostalgia in relation to 18th- century poetry.

The building was built for Noordeen Hajiar Abdul Gaffoor, one of the country's pioneer jewellers and gem stone traders. Gaffoor established N. D. H. Abdul Gaffoor & Sons (Export of Gems, Pearls, & Jewelry, Import of Diamonds) at the Bristol Hotel in Colombo in 1894. He was one of a few merchants who received exclusive permission to board ships in the Colombo harbour to sell gems and jewellery. In 1901 Gaffoor was granted the privilege of exhibiting pearls, diamonds, rubies and sapphires and art works to the Prince and Princess of Wales during their Royal visit. He took part in a number of world exhibitions including, the St. Louis World's Fair in 1904, All Ceylon Exhibition in 1912, the British Empire Exhibition in 1924 and the Philadelphia World Fair in 1925, all of which further enhanced his and his company's reputation. His younger brother, N. H. M. Abdul Cader, was one of the Muslim representatives on the Legislative Council, serving between 1917 and 1930. The building was completed in 1915 and was described as being \\"one of the largest and finest commercial structures in Colombo\\". The building not only provided space for Gaffoor's jewellery emporium, but also provided office space on the upper floors for many of Ceylon's most prominent companies and trading houses; well-known tenants included H. W. Cave & Co (the country's premier bookshop), Mackwoods Ltd, Holland-Ceylon Commercial Co and the Rubber and Produce Traders (Ceylon) Ltd. In October 1947 the office of Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka (which at the time was the Dominion of Ceylon) was relocated from the Galle Face Hotel to the Gaffoor Building. In 1950 it was relocated to the Grand Oriental Hotel. The Gaffoor Building was gazetted as a 'Protected Monument' under the Antiquities Ordinance on 4 October 2000, due to its historical value. In 2008 the Commissioner at the Department of Archeology, Dr. Senarath Dissanayake noted that the \\"building is in very bad condition and the money spent on its conservation is expected to be in the range of several millions of rupees.\\" \\"It is in a dilapidated condition and on the verge of collapsing. The worst thing is the water that seeps underneath making the foundation weak.\\" The building was subject to unauthorised works, with a portion of the building being converted into a car park despite it being declared as a heritage building. In 2012 a consortium of international investors proposed to redevelop the building into a 40-storey 300 room boutique hotel, at an investment of over US$ 90 million, inclusive of the value of the land. The major impediment to the redevelopment was the lack of clarity as to who the legal owners of the building were. The title to the building was with the EAP Group and the Edirisinghe family however there were a number of other claimants, including the descendants of the Gaffoor family, who lodged injunctions against building's sale. In addition the building was occupied by squatters and the investors were concerned that they might demand adverse possession of the building. Both issues had the potential to significantly delay the acquisition and redevelopment of the site. It was subsequently purchased by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) and the ownership was transferred to the Urban Development Authority (UDA).

It is situated west-northwest of Squamish, and south of Mount Tantalus, which is the highest peak in the Tantalus Range. Its nearest higher peak is The Red Tusk, to the northeast. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains west into tributaries of the Clowhom River, and east into Mill Creek which empties into Howe Sound. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1909 by H. Dowler. The mountain is named for Adam Sedgwick (1785-1873), one of the founders of modern geology who accompanied Sir Roderick Murchison on geological tours in Canada. The mountain's name was officially adopted on May 3, 1951, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Sedgwick is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Mount Sedgwick.

Design  There are three main variants of the design: the basic design, which simply swaps out the red background for black; a variant of the black flag where a few petals are withered; and a variant of the withered flag where the petals are also bloodstained. The latter two designs also omit the stars in the petals that symbolize the People's Republic of China.  Usage  Protesters occupying the Legislative Council chamber, with a Black Bauhinia flag visible in the background. The flag was displayed during the storming and occupation of the Legislative Council chamber by protesters on 1 July 2019. The People's Republic of China flags outside the building and at Golden Bauhinia Square were lowered, and the bloodstained variants of the Black Bauhinia were raised in their place. The Hong Kong flags were also lowered to half-mast as a sign of mourning. Five days later on 6 July, the Black Bauhinia was raised at the Cenotaph to mourn those who died during the protests.  Controversy  Hong Kong customs and police consider the flag to be a violation of the Regional Flag Act and a potential trademark violation.

Many notable musicians have recorded at the studio, including the Jayhawks, The Replacements, Motion City Soundtrack, Brian Setzer, Golden Smog, Mark Mallman, Soul Asylum, the Old 97's Rhett Miller, Clay Aiken, the Wallflowers, Pete Yorn, Juliana Hatfield, Free Energy, Lizzo, Jeremy Messersmith, and Joseph Arthur. History The Flowers building, located in the Lowry Hill East neighborhood of Minneapolis, was formerly a greenhouse and floral shop before being used as a warehouse space for a guitar store. A self-described \\"gear freak,\\" Ackerson had been a sound engineer at legendary Twin Cities club First Avenue and had already collected a wide variety of recording equipment on his own before deciding to start his own studio. Ackerson founded Flowers largely through money earned from his band Polara's contract with major label Interscope Records in the 1990s as well as an otherwise unsuccessful deal with Chris Blackwell's Palm Pictures. After Polara was dropped by Interscope, Ackerson went independent both as a musician with Polara and other bands, and as a producer at Flowers. Ackerson got advice on constructing Flowers from veteran recording engineers including Glyn Johns and Fort Apache producer Paul Kolderie, and worked with acoustic designer Dave Ahl, who was the drummer for seminal punk band Suicide Commandos. The second floor of the building was partially removed to create high ceilings for capturing an acoustically friendly environment. The control room was built from the blueprints of Kolderie's studio, Fort Apache, in Massachusetts. The greenhouse space became a lounge. The studio's large, open space is designed to accommodate either a full band playing together or isolated multitrack recording. Ackerson died of pancreatic cancer in October 2019. The studio remains open, now run by Ackerson's family; before his death, Ackerson chose Kris Johnson, guitarist in Minneapolis band Two Harbors, to be Flowers‚Äô head engineer and studio manager. Approach to production Ackerson took a holistic approach to making music, viewing composition, performance, recording and post-production all as steps in a single process of creating a song. He told an interviewer in Guitar Player magazine, \\"It's all part of the same thing‚Äîamps, guitars, effects. You're playing it all.\\" In an interview for Tape Op magazine, he said that the energy and vibe of a performance was more important to him than technical perfection, saying that as a producer \\"sometimes you have to be willing to get out of the way of the moment.\\" Selected discography References External links * Flowers website Category:Recording studios in the United States ","title":"Flowers Studio"},{"id":"62284317","text":"The 2019 Des Moines mayoral election had an initial round held on November 5, 2019, with a runoff scheduled for December 3 to elect the mayor of Des Moines, Iowa.

It is situated northwest of Squamish, and southeast of Mount Tantalus, which is the highest peak in the Tantalus Range. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Niobe, to the northwest, and Omega Mountain lies to the east. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into tributaries of the Squamish River. The first ascent of the mountain was made in 1916 by Tom Fyles and his brother, John Fyles. The mountain was named for Pelops, brother of Niobe and son of Tantalus according to Greek mythology, with several peaks in the Tantalus Range being named for family members of Tantalus. The mountain's name was officially adopted on June 6, 1957, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Pelops (left) and Niobe Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Pelops is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. This climate supports small glacier remnants on the east and north slopes of Pelops. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Pelops.

Education  Langford‚Äôs painting practice emerges from a lifelong fascination with the endlessly varied forms of the natural world. This fascination began during childhood, and grew rapidly; by his teens, Langford had gathered a personal collection of over 1000 atlases and maps. His cartographic impulse quickly carried over to his studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) where he studied geography and cartography., and later to a job creating maps for faculty at UCLA. His artistic training was supplemented with his time with the Berkeley Art Cooperative, working in ceramics, as well as life drawing at the Brentwood Art Center in Los Angeles, California. Career After graduation he started working with the Geography department of UCLA as their staff cartographer. Using his cartographic expertise he took geographic forms and filled the shapes in with colorful and expressive brushwork. These ‚Äúmap-paintings‚Äù were featured in the book ‚ÄòThe Map as Art, Contemporary Artists Explore Cartography‚Äô. Langford gradually departed from using exact cartographic representation to fully abstract and expressionist works aided by his skills in life drawing and ceramics. Langford started to sell his painting in his home and studio at invite only events. In 2011 he was contacted by San Diego based artist Amber George who invited him to take part in a group show she was curating at Susan Eley Fine Art. In 2014, Langford held his own solo show at Susan Eley Fine Art. Work Langford‚Äôs work stacks brightly contrasting pigments, which recall sedimentary cross- sections as much as they do aerial views of rivers, valleys, and rock formations. Langford begins his canvases with impulsive mark-making, a technique that forms and gentles to a refinement of aesthetic in abstract, layered shapes. His pieces are primarily oil paintings on canvas or wood panel, but also has some work on paper. Some include metallic paints containing bronze or aluminum. Collections Langford‚Äôs work is in the collection of a few celebrities, hotels and museums, including: *Magic Johnson *The Saudi Royal Family *Paris Hotel Las Vegas *Caesars Palace Hotel Las Vegas *The Michael & Susan Dell Foundation, Austin, Texas *Monique Lhuillier *Pete Sampras *Four Seasons in Hong Kong *Park Hyatt Aviara *The Long Beach Museum of Art *Nordstrom Stores Galleries Langford‚Äôs work has been exhibited in many galleries, including: * Eisenhauer Gallery, Edgartown, MA *Foster/White Gallery in Seattle, WA * Susan Eley Fine Art, New York City * Elder Gallery of Contemporary Art, Charlotte, NC *Coagula Curatorial, Los Angeles, CA * Kirkland Art Center, Kirkland, WA Publications His work has been featured in Metropolitan Home, and Huffington Post and Beverly Hills Lifestyle Magazine.

Coast Guard service Bell's father was an electronic technician with the telephone company, and his grandfather, who he lived with for several years while attending school, owned an electronics shop, and it was from them he first acquired an aptitude for electronics. Bell worked for a few months as a mechanics assistant, but met United States Coast Guard sailors at the YMCA where he was living, and decided to enlist, in November 1938. At the time he enlisted there was no recruiting office - so he enlisted on board . The Territory of Hawaii was isolated so he was not sent to the continental United States for basic training. In a 2014 interview Bell described how he initially worked as a mess attendant. Prior to World War II the Coast Guard, Army and Navy were segregated, and non-white personnel were almost always assigned service roles, like mess attendant. In his interview he described how he was able to make the extraordinary jump from mess attendant to skilled radio technician. Due to his familiarity with electronics, he was welcome to spend his off-duty hours in Taneys radio room. In May 1939 Taneys long range radio broke down, which severely restricted her operations. Taneys radio had been down for close to a month, the District Communication's Officer, Henry Arnold had tried to assist the ship's senior radio operator in fixing it, without success. When they left, on Friday night, Bell asked the junior radio operator who was on duty if he could try fixing the radio. Bell had been watching closely, and he avoided duplicating anything the senior officers had already tried. He was thorough, and methodical. He ended up opening up the panel in the floor and methodically tracing and testing the leads coming to and leading away from the radio, and he found that an incoming relay had a short circuit. After he replaced the relay with a spare, and powered up the radio, he found he had fixed it. When he informed the radio operator on duty, he sent a signal to District HQ, informing them the ship was back online. Arnold, the District Communication Officer, was on duty, and asked who fixed the radio. When he was informed the radio he had tried and failed to fix had been fixed by a 19-year-old mess attendant, he took Bell under his wing. Bell attributed his transfer to the electronics branch to Arnold's mentorship. Bell attributed his appointment as the radio operator of the small patrol boat to Arnold's mentorship. Arnold continued to mentor Bell for the duration of World War II. When a large fleet of aircraft carrier- launched Japanese warplanes engaged in a sneak attack on US Navy forces at Pearl Harbor Bell was the radio operator at the Coast Guard Station at nearby Diamond Head. He was the one who warned civilian vessels to steer clear of the attack. Later in World War II Bell learned Japanese and helped break Japanese codes. In 1943 he became the first Pacific Islander to be promoted to chief petty officer. After the war Bell became an electronics instructor for the Coast Guard. In 1958 when he was promoted to master chief petty officer he was the first member of any minority to hold that rank. When Bell retired after 20 years of active duty he started working for the Coast Guard as a civilian employee. US Navy career After a long career with the Coast Guard he began a long career as a civilian employee of the US Navy. During his career there he worked with both the Polaris and Trident ballistic missile programs. Legacy When Bell retired from the US Navy, in 2004, he was 84 years old, and received an official recognition from President George W. Bush, honoring him for a long and distinguished career. On July 26, 2019, Congressional Representative Luis Correa marked the 229th anniversary of the founding of the Coast Guard by addressing Congress, and noting the highlights of the careers of fourteen members of the Coast Guard, from minorities, whose accomplishments he felt merited more recognition. Bell was one of the heroes he recognized. In 2010, Charles \\"Skip\\" W. Bowen, who was then the Coast Guard's most senior non- commissioned officer, proposed that all the cutters in the should be named after enlisted sailors in the Coast Guard, or one of its precursor services, who were recognized for their heroism.

In the Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci, Milan. Major Philip Cardew (24 September 1851 ‚Äì 17 May 1910), was an English army officer in the Royal Engineers. Engaged in the application of electricity to military purposes, he designed innovations in electrical engineering. Early life and career Cardew was born at Oakshade, near Leatherhead, Surrey, on 24 September 1851, eldest son in a family of four sons and four daughters of Captain Christopher Baldock Cardew, 74th Highlanders, of East Hill, Liss, and his wife Eliza Jane, second daughter of Sir Richard Bethell, 1st Baron Westbury. Educated at Guildford Grammar School, he passed first into the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1868, and left it at the head of his batch. He was awarded the Pollock Medal and the Sword of Honour, and received a commission as lieutenant in the Royal Engineers on 4 January 1871. After two years at Chatham, Cardew was sent to Aldershot and Portsmouth; from September 1873 to April 1874 he was employed at the War Office on defences; and, after a year at Glasgow, went to Bermuda in May 1875. He was placed in charge of military telegraphs, and joined the Submarine Mining Service, engaging in the application of electricity to military purposes, which was to be the pursuit of his life. At the end of 1876 he was transferred to Chatham, where the headquarters of the submarine mining was on board HMS Hood, which lay in the Medway off Gillingham. In 1878 he was acting adjutant of the submarine miners at Portsmouth, and became in the same year (1 April) assistant instructor in electricity at Chatham. Research In addition to his work of instruction, Cardew assisted in carrying out some important experiments with electric searchlight apparatus for the Royal Engineers committee, at a time when the subject was in its infancy. The need of better instruments for such work led him to design a galvanometer for measuring large currents of electricity (described in a paper read before the Institution of Electrical Engineers, 25 May 1882). He next evolved the idea of the hot-wire galvanometer, or voltmeter, the value of which was universally recognised among electrical engineers. He was awarded the gold medal for this invention at the International Inventions Exhibition in London of 1885. He also originated a method of finding the efficiency of a dynamo. Cardew's invention of the vibratory transmitter for telegraphy was perhaps his most important discovery, and in the case of faulty lines proved most useful, not only on active service in the Nile Expedition and in India, but also during heavy snowstorms at home. Cardew received a money reward for this invention, half from the Imperial and half from the Indian government. The utility of the invention was much extended by Cardew's further invention of \\"separators\\", consisting of a combination of \\"choking coil\\" and two condensers. These instruments enabled a vibrating telegraph circuit to be superimposed on an ordinary Morse circuit without interference between the two, thus doubling the message-carrying capability of the line. His apparatus for testing lightning conductors was adopted by the war department for service. Promoted captain on 4 January 1883, and major on 12 April 1889, Cardew was from 1 April 1882 instructor in electricity at Chatham. On 1 April 1889 he was appointed the first electrical adviser to the Board of Trade. He held a long inquiry into the various proposals for the electric lighting of London, and drew up valuable regulations concerning the supply of electricity for power and for light. Later years Cardew retired from the Royal Engineers on 24 October 1894, and from the Board of Trade in 1898. He then entered into partnership with Sir William Preece & Sons, consulting engineers, and was actively engaged on large admiralty orders, involving an expenditure of ¬£1,500,000. He joined the board of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway in 1902. Cardew paid two visits to Sydney, Australia, in connection with the city's electrical installations. Soon after his return home from the second visit in 1909, by way of Japan and Siberia, he died on 17 May 1910 at his residence, Crownpits House, Godalming, Surrey. He was buried at Brookwood Cemetery. Scientific papers In 1881 Cardew wrote a paper on \\"The application of dynamo electric machines to railway rolling stock\\"; in 1894 he contributed a paper to the Royal Society on \\"Uni-directional currents to earth from alternate current systems\\"; and in 1901 he delivered the Cantor lecture before the Society of Arts on \\"Electric railways\\". He contributed several papers to the Institution of Electrical Engineers, on whose council he served for many years, and was vice-president in 1901‚Äì2. Family Cardew married in London, on 19 June 1879, his first cousin, Mary Annunziata, daughter of Mansfield Parkyns. She survived him with three sons and two daughters.

After graduating, she became a teacher at the Buddhist Girls‚Äô College in Mount Lavinia and became its first Principal. She joined the South Colombo Youth League and became active in local politics after Philip Gunawardena joined the South Colombo Youth League. She was active in the Suriya Mala movement, which in 1933 started a relief program for the malaria epidemic that ravage the island leading to over 10,000 deaths in two months. There she met Dr N. M. Perera, who had recently returned from London having completed his doctorate. In 1935, when the Lanka Sama Samaja Party was formed, she was a founding member and was elected to its central committee and served as the party treasurer. She married N. M. Perera on 6 March 1936. She assisted in hiding Mark Anthony Bracegirdle during the Bracegirdle incident. In 1938, with funding from her father, she enrolled at the School of Oriental and African Studies to study Sanskrit and Pali, and graduated in June 1939 with a BA degree in Indo-Aryan Languages with a Lower Second Class Honors. There she came into contact with local Trotskyist groups, briefly staying with Charlie van Gelderen. In 1939, she made her way to the United States linking up with the Socialist Workers Party, in hopes of traveling to Mexico to meet Trotsky, but failed due to visa problems. On her return to Ceylon, she rejoined the party and worked on its anti-war movement. In June 1940, several party leaders were arrested including N.M. Perera. LSSP responded with large protest march which was baton charged by the police. Leading the march Selina was arrested and jailed. But she was released soon after. In the next year she led many of the party activities before escaping to India with her husband and worked with the Bolshevik- Leninist Party of India, Ceylon and Burma (BLPI). When most of the LSSP members were arrested and deported to Ceylon in July 1943, she with Vivienne Goonewardena and Colvin R. de Silva escaped to Calcutta. She became disillusioned with the pre-partition politics in India. She opted to stary in India, adopting the name Sheela Perera, making a living as an English teacher until her death in 1986.

Biography  Roux was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine. Student at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure de Saint Cloud, Roux studies the influence of interactions between micelles on the critical behaviour of micro-emulsions during his doctorate at the University of Bordeaux. He studies the stability of micro-emulsions, discovers the existence of wave interactions and sponge phases.Pourquoi j'ai choisi la science ? Conf√©rence de l'UTLS. This work is of interest to the oil industry and particularly to Exxon, where he was appointed associate scientist in 1986. Research director at the CNRS in Bordeaux, he discovered a new type of instability, the onion phases corresponding to a dynamic transition from a lamellar phase oriented towards a multilamellar vesicle phase. These vesicles are used as micro chemical reactors or as biological vectors. He co-founded two biotechnology startups Capsulis, specialized in the microencapsulation of active substances, and Rheocontrol, which markets new rheometers. In 1998, he was appointed Deputy Scientific Director of Rh√¥ne-Poulenc and then director of research and innovation of Saint-Gobain in 2005.Saint-Gobain.

He was appointed chairman of the Scientific Council of ADEME in 2013 and chairman of the Scientific Council of the Ecole Nationale des Ponts et Chauss√©s (ENPC) in 2015.  Basic sciences and industrial innovations  Roux's career is based above all on the work of a fundamentalist researcher who has long been centred around the physico- chemistry of condensed matter. His most significant works correspond to studies at equilibrium and out of equilibrium of the behaviour of partially organized phases (liquid crystals, colloids, surfactants in solution...). On the one hand, they were based on both an experimental and theoretical modelling approach to describe and understand the behaviour of very flexible surfaces subjected to thermal fluctuations (fluctuating surfaces). This has made it possible to obtain a universal vision of the behaviour of these surfaces by highlighting in particular the existence of undulation interactions between membranesC. R.

His work also expands into the field of painting, animation, public space monumental art, stage installations. In Estonian art history, Kurismaa‚Äôs significance lies mostly in the pioneering work with kinetic art and with keeping its traditions alive. Kurismaa stands as one of Estonian sound art scene‚Äôs central icons. His idiosyncratic work serves as a foundation for Estonian sound and kinetic art.  Biography and art  Kurismaa was born in P√§rnu, but his family soon moved to the capital, Tallinn, where his parents opened a bakery. He was creatively very active from early on, taking part of school orchestra and spending time drawing absurdist comics.Ragne Soosalu. ‚Äì Kaarel Kurismaa. Yellow Light Orchecstra. . Ed. Ragne Soosalu. Tallinn, 2018 When Kurismaa was not accepted to the music school in 1957 in Tallinn, he decided to enroll in the Tartu Art School. In 1965, Kurismaa started to work as an artist-decorator for the Tallinn Department Store while also commencing studies in monumental painting at the State Art Institute. Work at the Tallinn Department Store (opened in 1960, brand name Tallinna Kaubamaja) offered a variety of ways to experiment with readymade materials and forms, as well as opportunity to exhibit his works in the department store‚Äôs exhibitions. His first kinetic object stems from the year 1966 and is also the first kinetic object in Estonian art history. It has not survived, but consisted of a fireplace grid and several kitchen utensils.Auguste Petre (26 November 2018). \\"The brightest man in the orchestra\\". Arterritory. His oeuvre combines sound, music, sculpture, painting, literature, drama, monumental art and design in various ways. Kurismaa‚Äôs preferred materials like plastic and wood, he liked to reuse furniture details or shapes and boards from construction factories ‚Äì the very limited outlet of the Soviet time consumer possibilities made all artists very creative in finding the right materials for their artworks, so in the case of Kurismaa.Rosenfeld, Alla (2001). Art of the Baltics: The Struggle for Freedom of Artistic Expression under the Soviets, 1945-1991 (Dodge Soviet Nonconformist Art Publication Series). Rutgers University Press. p. 130. . He mostly worked with round, streamlined and exuberant forms ‚Äì there is hardly any angular geometry apparent in Kurismaa‚Äôs works. There is no doubt that popart has strongly influenced Kurismaa‚Äôs works in the 1970s.Auguste Petre (26 November 2018). \\"The brightest man in the orchestra\\". Arterritory. Kaarel Kurismaa and his objects also play a role in the history of Estonian new music as in the 1970s he collaborated with the cult progressive rock group Mess. Kurismaa has admitted that Finnish television allowed the locals to get an inkling of what was happening in the rest of the world and what else was being done on stage besides playing music. He has recalled a show by Electric Light Orchestra and performances by the jazz rock band Mahavishnu Orchestra ‚Äì both these groups were established in the early 1970s. Kurismaa was responsible for the stage setting, which consisted of various objects, a light show and photo slides, which enhanced the impact of Mess‚Äôs music at concerts and turned their performances nearly ritualistic. Art critics have always looked at Kurismaa‚Äôs objects in exhibition context and described them with certain clich√©s, Mess‚Äôs music, however, created a completely different cognitive atmosphere around Kurismaa‚Äôs objects.\\"Avatakse Kaarel Kurismaa mahukas retrospektiivn√§itus\\". Postimees (in Estonian). 18 September 2018. Retrieved 14 August 2019. When the wave of avant-garde died down in the late 1970s, Kurismaa‚Äôs priorities also changed. At the beginning of the new decade, he focused on animated children's films, then came commissions for a number of objects for public spaces, such as the Tallinn central post office and the sculpture for the High-voltage Networks of Region North.Ragne Soosalu. ‚Äì Kaarel Kurismaa. Yellow Light Orchestra. . Ed. Ragne Soosalu. Tallinn, 2018 He was able to realise close to 10 kinetic and/or sound objects for public spaces during the 80s, though all of them have been demolished or lost. This decade was also very fruitful in terms of his painting.\\"Eesti n√º√ºdiskunst: Kaarel Kurismaa\\". Eesti Rahvusringh√§√§ling (in Estonian). 1990. Retrieved 14 August 2019. The 1990s saw a new awakening and a significant turn in Kurismaa‚Äôs creative life. Once again, he focused on sound, even more so than he had in the 1970s. The aesthetic paradigm of his sound objects also altered to the creation of site- specific sound sculptures and installations. He left aside small objects furtively snuffling in the corners and their soul landscapes, and started to actively interfere with the space with both visual and acoustic means.Ibid.

He served as the chief archaeologist of the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor and Dean of the School of Cultural Heritage of Northwest University in Xi'an. He discovered the large-scale drainage system of Qin Shi Huang's mausoleum and a high-ranking noble tomb in the mausoleum precinct. He also spent over two years surveying more than of the Great Wall on foot.  Life and career  Duan was born in February 1964 in Ruicheng County, Shanxi, China. He graduated from Northwest University in Xi'an with a bachelor's degree in archaeology in 1985. He later earned a Ph.D. in archaeology in 2008. He began working at the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology in 1988, where he served as deputy director of the Qin‚ÄìHan Archaeological Research Office and director of the Sui‚ÄìTang Archaeological Research Office. In 1998, Duan was appointed chief archaeologist of the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor. In the following decade, he led the excavation of the mausoleum precinct. His team discovered the ruins of China's three oldest and largest que towers, the mausoleum's large-scale underground dam and drainage system, and a large double-ramped noble tomb that ranks only below Qin Shi Huang's own mausoleum in importance. He oversaw the publication of three excavation reports, in 1999, 2000, and 2002. Duan's excavations led him to the conclusion that the underground realm of the mausoleum imitated the real organization of the court in the emperor's lifetime, with terracotta officials, musicians, even acrobats and realistic bronze waterfowl, in addition to the famous Terracotta Army. He also found that the emperor might have employed people from west Eurasia, as the structure of the mausoleum bore similarities to the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, which had been built a century earlier in today's Turkey. Duan found that the Epang Palace, recorded in histories as a luxurious palace which symbolized Qin Shi Huang's tyranny and greed, was actually never built except for its foundation. In his 2018 book, Qin Mausoleum: A Dust-Laden Empire, he argues that Qin Shi Huang had been vilified by Han dynasty historians such as Sima Qian, who have cemented the emperor's reputation as a cruel and tyrannical ruler. In 2006, he was appointed leader of the Shaanxi Great Wall Survey Team and spent the next two years surveying of the Great Wall in Shaanxi on foot. He subsequently surveyed parts of the Great Wall in neighbouring Gansu province. In 2009, Duan returned to his alma mater to teach at the School of Cultural Heritage of Northwest University. He served as deputy dean of the school from 2010 to 2014 and as dean from 2017 until his death. He advised 48 graduate students at the university. Duan authored more than 10 books and about 100 research papers. He received over 10 national, provincial, and ministerial awards.  Death  Duan was diagnosed with kidney cancer and had one of his kidneys surgically removed in 2016. In May 2019, it was discovered that his cancer had metastasized to his lung. He underwent another surgery in July 2019, but died on 13 October 2019 in Xi'an, aged 55. He was survived by his wife Wu Chun (Âê¥Êò•).

It recently shows that, when hydrogenating a double bond on platinum, the coordination of this double bond on the surface is not necessary.

She moved to the Theater Heilbronn, to the Hessisches Staatstheater Wiesbaden in 1929, and then to the Staatsoper Stuttgart. From 1934 to 1941 she was the first alto at the Theater Freiburg. From 1941, she was a member of the Bavarian State Opera where she remained until her retirement in 1967. There she was regarded as a highly esteemed and extremely popular singer with the audience. For more than twenty years, Gerhein took part in the Munich Opera Festival almost annually. She was appointed Bayerische Kammers√§ngerin. Gerhein sang a broad repertoire ranging from contralto to dramatic mezzo-soprano.Rico Leitner in Zar und Zimmermann (CD-Booklet, page 11. Relief CD, order no. CR 1912). She frequently alternated in various roles with her teacher Luise Willer. Her roles included the title role in Bizet's Carmen, Azucena in Verdi's Il trovatore, Brang√§ne in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde, and the Witch in Humperdinck's H√§nsel und Gretel. Other important opera roles, especially later in her career, were Erda in Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen (among others 1952 in the Ring performances in Munich under Hans Knappertsbusch), the housekeeper Marzelline in Rossini's Der Barbier von Sevilla, Annina in Der Rosenkavalier by Richard Strauss, Ludmila in Smetana's Die verkaufte Braut and Mother Goose in Stravinsky's The Rake's Progress. In December 1959, she appeared as Marzelline in a performance at the Nationaltheater M√ºnchen which became legendary, alongside Erika K√∂th, Fritz Wunderlich and Hermann Prey, conducted by Joseph Keilberth. The performance was recorded for television and later published by Deutsche Grammophon on DVD (2005) and CD. In the course of her career, Gerhein appeared as a guest at the Semperoper in Dresden, the Staatsoper Stuttgart, and the Dublin Opera House, among others. In the 1951/52 season, she appeared at the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma as the Overseer in Elektra by Richard Strauss. In 1953, she performed at the Maggio Musicale Fiorentino at the Teatro Comunale di Firenze as Magdalene in Wagner's Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg. She appeared at La Fenice in Venice with the ensemble of the Bavarian State Opera. In addition to her opera career, Gerhein was also active as a concert and lieder singer. After her retirement from the stage she lived in Berg at Lake Starnberg. She died in February 1995 at the age of 88 and was buried in Wolfratshausen.  Recordings  Several live recordings and radio recordings documenting Gerhein's voice, mainly from the 1950s. In a performance of Pfitner's Palestrina, she sang the Appatition of Lucrezia. It was conducted by Robert Heger at the Prinzregententheater in Munich in 1951. She recorded two versions of Der Rosenkavalier by Richard Strauss in the role of Annina, both from Munich, in July 1952 alongside Kurt B√∂hme as Ochs conducted by Erich Kleiber, and in September 1957 alongside Otto Edelmann as Ochs, conducted by Knappertsbusch. She also recorded the final scene of the second act a recording with Josef Greindl as Ochs, conducted in 1951 by Eugen Szenkar. In another production of the Bavarian State Opera, she appeared as Ursula in Feuersnot by Richard Strauss, conducted in 1958 by Kempe. Gerhein sang the role of Marthe in Lortzing's Undine in a radio recording of RAI from September 1953, again conducted by Heger. She sang the Widow Browe in Lortzings's Zar und Zimmermann in a 1956 radio recording of Bayerischer Rundfunk, conducted by Jan Koetsier. In some re-releases of audio documents, Gerhein is mistakenly referred to as Ina Gerheim.

Robert Elphinstone, 3rd Lord Elphinstone (1530-1602) was a Scottish landowner and courtier. Robert Elphinstone was the son of Alexander Elphinstone, 2nd Lord Elphinstone and Katherine Erskine, daughter of Robert Erskine, 4th Lord Erskine and Isobel Campbell. His aunt Euphemia Elphinstone was a mistress of James V of Scotland and the mother of Robert, Earl of Orkney. The Elphinstone lands were to the east of Stirling near Airth and the Forth, centered on Elphinstone Tower. His sister Margery Elphinstone married his neighbour Robert Drummond of Carnock in the 1540s.William Fraser, Elphinstone Family Book, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1897), p. 3. Their coat of arms from Carnock House was obtained by Harold Nicolson and Vita Sackville-West had it displayed at Sissinghurst Castle.The Scottish Antiquary, or, Northern Notes and Queries, vol. 10, no. 39, (Edinburgh, 1896), pp. 99-100. Robert became Lord Elphinstone after the death of his father at the Battle of Pinkie on 10 September 1547. On 16 May 1554, because he had made poor decisions about his properties in his youth, Lord Elphinstone put his affairs in the hands of his grandfather Lord Erskine, his father-in-law John Drummond of Innerpeffray, and his brothers-in-law Robert Drummond of Carnock and John Hamilton of Haggs. This transaction was enacted before Mary of Guise and the Privy Council of Scotland in her presence chamber at Stirling Castle.Register of Privy Council of Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1877), p. 140: William Fraser, Elphinstone Family Book, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1897), p. 98-99. Subsequently the Elphinstones and Erskines continued a feud. In May 1565 his brother-in-law Alexander Drummond of Midhope Castle was charged with conspiring with Lady Elphinstone to defraud Lord Elphinstone of his income over the past three years. However, there does not seem to have been a trial, or any further evidence of bad feeling between Elphinstone and his wife and the Drummonds of Midhope.William Fraser, Elphinstone Family Book, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1897), pp. 101-2. In April 1567 it was said that Lord Elphinstone had avoided signing the Ainslie Tavern Bond which would have pledged his support for the Earl of Bothwell. In May 1568, because he was a supporter of Mary, Queen of Scots, Regent Moray ordered him to surrender Elphinstone Tower.Register of Privy Council of Scotland, vol.1 (Edinburgh, 1877), p. 626. In 1577 he was said to be a Catholic and still a supporter of the exiled Mary, Queen of Scots.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 254 no. 284. In that year he transferred his estates to his eldest son, Alexander, Master of Elphinsone.William Fraser, Elphinstone Family Book, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1897), p. 103.

Biography  After studying at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des industries chimiques de Nancy from 1958 to 1961, he obtained a doctorate under the supervision of Professor Serge David in 1966 and continued for two years at Harvard University in Massachusetts (United States) as a post-doctoral researcher with Professor Roger W. Jeanloz. He then entered the University of Orl√©ans in 1969 as a professor, where he was Director of the Institute of Organic and Analytical Chemistry from 1978 to 1987. He then became Professor of Chemistry in 1986 at the Universit√© Pierre-et-Marie-Curie, where he then headed the Laboratory of Selective Processes in Organic and Bioorganic Chemistry in the Department of Chemistry at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure. He then became Professor Emeritus at Sorbonne University in 2006 and joined the Paris Institute of Molecular Chemistry.  Scientific work  Pierre Sina√ø's scientific work focuses on the chemistry of carbohydrates and the understanding of the role of oligosaccharides in the living world.

Description The shrub or tree typically grows to a maximum height of . It has hairy ribbed branchlets with resinous young shoots. Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The evergreen phyllodes have silvery coloured hairs and a narrowly elliptic to lanceolate shape that can be straight or shallowly curved. The phyllodes have a length of and a width of and contain many fine, rather closely packed veins, with two or three that are more prominent. The simple inflorescences occur in pairs on racemes. The cylindrical flower-spikes have a length of and is sub-densely packed with golden flowers. Following flowering firmly chartaceous to thinly coriaceous and glabrous seed pods form. the pods have a linear shape and are raised over the seeds and a have a length up to around and a width of . The shiny brown seeds have an oblong shape with a length of with a small aril. Taxonomy Th species was first formally described by the botanist George Bentham in 1864 as part of the work Flora Australiensis, it was reclassified as Racosperma leptostachyum by Leslie Pedley in 1987 then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2001. Other synonyms include Acacia capillosa and Acacia argentea and is commonly confused with Acacia conspersa. The specific epithet is derived from the Greek words lepto meaning slender and stachys meaning ear of corn in reference to the shape of the flower spikes. Distribution It is endemic to central-eastern parts of Cape York Peninsula from around Coen in the north extending through coastal and inland areas to around Maryborough and south of Charleville in the south. It is found in a variety of habitat growing in deep sandy or skeletal soils overlaying granite or sandstone bedrock as a part of Eucalyptus woodland communities or Triodia grasslands. Cultivation The shrub or tree grows well a full sun position in dry well drained soils. It can be propagated from seed after seeds are scarified or treated with boiling water.

It gained publicity as a term for people who are characterized as \\"harmful organisms\\" because of their non-conformist behavior, usually with the intention to degrade them as vermin and to dehumanize them. Before the Nazi takeover In the so-called fighting time of the NSDAP this term was used to describe \\"traffickers and usurers\\" and from 1930 the term was also used for alleged traitors to the Nation. During the war Page 1679 from the Reichsgesetzblatt I with the Ordinance against ‚ÄòPests harmful to the Common Good of the Country‚Äô of September 5, 1939 From 1939, the designation became a legal term through its use in the Ordinance against ‚ÄòPests harmful to the Common Good of the Country‚Äô of 5 September 1939. According to ¬ß 4 of this ordinance, the person who \\"intentionally commits a criminal offence by exploiting the extraordinary circumstances caused by the state of war\\" was regarded as a Pest harmful to the Common Good of the Country. In this case, the offender was punished \\"by exceeding the regular penalty of imprisonment for up to 15 years, life imprisonment or death, if this was required by the justified popular sentiment because of the particular reprehensibility of the offence\\". In the ordinance of 1939, the following type of crimes were enumerated: 50px. * Looting in cleared areas. * Crimes during air raid warnings * Malicious destruction, such as arson * Using the war conditions to commit crimes Roland Freisler's interpretation Roland Freisler, Prussian State Secretary for Justice at the time, wrote about this in the legal journal Deutsche Justiz, 1939, p. 1450: Deserters The content of the term Volkssch√§dling, which was not conclusively defined in the ordinance, expanded increasingly during the course of National Socialist legal practice and, shortly before the end of the war, was used primarily to refer to deserters. In March 1945 Victor Klemperer reports of a group of field police officers wearing an armband with the inscription \\"Volkssch√§dlingsbek√§mpfer‚Äù.

The forces of the Yuan were based on the troops that were loyal to Kublai after the Division of the Mongol Empire in 1260. At first this Tamma, a frontier army drawn from all Mongol tribes for conquest of China, had no central organisation but was rather a loose collection of local warlords and Mongol princely armies. However the army was gradually reformed by Kublai Khan into a more systematic force. Guards Yuan horseman Yuan Cavalry were mainly Mongols while infantry were mainly Chinese. For his own bodyguards Kublai retained the use of the traditional Mongol Keshig. Kublai created a new Imperial guard force, the suwei, of which half were Chinese and the other half ethnically mixed. By the 1300s even the Keshig were flooded with Chinese recruits. The suwei were initially 6,500 strong but by the end of the dynasty it had become 100,000 strong. They were divided into wei or guards, each recruited from a particular ethnicity. Most wei were Chinese, while a few were Mongols, Koreans, Tungusic peoples, and Central Asians/Middle Easterners including Kipchaks, Alans and even one unit of Russians. The Keshig was converted into a administrative organisation instead. Administration Unlike previous Chinese dynasties that strictly separated military and civilian power, the Yuan administration of military and civil affairs tended to overlap, as a result of traditional Mongol reliance on military matters. This was harshly criticised by the Chinese scholar officials at the time. Military officers were allowed to pass on their positions to their sons or grandsons after death, retirement or sometimes even after a promotion. Due to their Mongol background and unlike the previous Chinese dynasties, the Yuan granted feudal fief appanages with serfs throughout North China to military leaders, Mongol, Middle eastern/Central Asian and Han. The conflict between these military nobles with the Imperial government was a persistent feature until the end of the dynasty. Army Yuan era helmet The Yuan dynasty created a \\"Han Army\\" () out of defected Jin troops and army of defected Song troops called the \\"Newly Submitted Army\\" ().Hucker 1985, p.66. Southern Song Chinese troops who defected and surrendered to the Mongols were granted Korean women as wives by the Mongols, whom the Mongols earlier took during their invasion of Korea as war booty. The many Song Chinese troops who defected to the Mongols were given oxen, clothes and land by Kublai Khan. As prize for battlefield victories, lands sectioned off as appanages were handed by the Yuan dynasty to Chinese military officers who defected to the Mongol side. The Yuan gave Song Chinese soldiers who defected to the Mongols juntun, a type of military farmland. Cherik soldiers were non-nomad soldiers in the Mongol military. Jin defectors and Han Chinese conscripts were recruited into new armies formed by the Mongols as they destroyed the Jin dynasty and these played a critical role in the defeat of the Jin. Han Chinese defectors led by General Liu Bolin defended Tiancheng from the Jin in 1214 while Genghis Khan was busy going back north. In 1215 Xijing fell to Liu Bolin's army. The original Han cherik forces were created in 1216 and Liu Bolin appointed as their leading officer. As Han troops kept defecting from the Jin to the Mongols the size of Han cherik forces swelled and they had to be partitioned between different units. Han soldiers made up the majority of the Khitan Yelu Tuhua's army, while Juyin soldiers (Khitans, Tanguts, Ongguds and other vassal tribes) from Zhongdu made up Chalaer's army and Khitan made up Uyar's army. Chalaer, Yelu Tuhua and Uyar led three cherik armies in northern China under the Mongol commander Muqali in addition to his tamma armies in 1217-1218. The first Han armies in the Mongol army were those led by defecting individual officers. There were 1,000 Han (Chinese) troops each in 26 units which made up three tumed arranged by Ogedei Khan on a decimal system. The Han officer Shi Tianze, Han officer Liu Ni and the Khitan officer Xiao Chala, all three of whom defected to the Mongols from the Jin led these three tumed. Chang Jung, Yen Shi and Chung Jou led three additional tumed which were created before 1234. The Han defectors were called the \\"Black Army\\" (Hei Jun) by the Mongols before 1235. A new infantry based \\"New Army\\" (Xin Jun) was created after the Mongols received 95,000 additional Han soldiers through conscription once the 1236 and 1241 censuses were taken after the Jin was crushed. Han cherik forces were used to fight against Li Tan's revolt in 1262. The New Army and Black Army had hereditary officer posts like the Mongol army itself. As a fully militarised society the Mongol rulers of the Yuan dynasty attempted to replicate elements of their own military in Chinese society. This was to be accomplished by establishing hereditary military households under the Bureau of Military Affairs that would provide troops for recruitment. Military households were grouped into four segments: Mongolian, Tammachi, Han, and the \\"Newly Adhered\\", each with different privileges including grants of stipends, food or tax exemptions. The Tammachi were Mongols and other steppe tribes on the southern edge of Mongolia. Han consisted of the North China forces that joined the Mongols before the 1250s while the \\"Newly Adhered\\" consisted of the South China forces that joined during the 1270s. The Han units were organised from Chinese warlord forces starting in 1232 under Ogedei Khan, and in 1241, the number of military households constituted 1 out of 7 households in North China, and formed an important element of the Mongol army. While most were peasant militia, some were capable of serving as cavalry forces equal to the Mongols, having been drawn from experienced frontier veterans or former Jin dynasty cavalrymen. The necessary numbers of troops for Kublai Khan's campaigns could only fulfilled by relying on the vast numbers of Southern Chinese soldiers that submitted in the 1270s, especially for naval expeditions which were composed entirely of Chinese and Koreans. Before Kublai, the early Mongol Empire had been accepting of autonomous Chinese warlords as key subordinates, but during the Yuan dynasty, there was considerable backlash from Mongols due to fear of Chinese insurrection, and these hereditary commanders were increasingly restricted. Due to the low status of military professions in China, and exploitation by corrupt administrators, desertion was a massive problem after the death of Kublai Khan. The Mongolian army was under direct command of the Emperor, while Tammachi were under semi- independent Mongol lords. Five Tammachi clans, the touxia, seem to have served the Yuan as allies under their own chiefs. Mongol forces were divided into toumans of 10,000 under a wanhu, divided into minghans of 1,000 under a qianhu, but in practice toumans ranged from 3,000 to 7,000 in strength. Mongols, now living in China, had immense difficulty meeting their military service obligations, as they needed to make a living as farmers and had no pastures to rear horses, having to purchase them at their own expense. By the 1300s many Mongol men could not even foot the cost for travel to enlist in the army. The Yuan army also contained a force known as the Tongshi Jun, which were Mongols who had fought against the Mongols for the Song dynasty. Other specialist troops were an Artillery Army, a Crossbow Army, a Miao Army (which was used to garrison Suzhou and Hangzhou in the 1350s), and other tribal forces from Southern China. There were also military artisan households which provided hereditary services for the production of military equipment such as weapons, armour, siege engines. These were under the command of the military registers. File:Yuan chinese gun.jpgChinese hand cannon, Yuan dynasty. File:Heilongjiang hand cannon.jpgHeilongjiang hand cannon, 1287-1288.

The oldest confirmed surviving specimen of a metal cannon, the Xanadu Gun, is from Yuan dynasty China, dating to 1298. Based on contextual evidence, historians believe another possibly older cannon, the Heilongjiang hand cannon, was used by Yuan forces against a rebellion by Mongol prince Nayan in 1287. The History of Yuan states that a Jurchen commander known as Li Ting led troops armed with hand cannons into battle against Nayan. By the time of Jiao Yu and his Huolongjing (a book that describes military applications of gunpowder in great detail) in the mid 14th century, the explosive potential of gunpowder was perfected, as the level of nitrate in gunpowder formulas had risen from a range of 12% to 91%, with at least 6 different formulas in use that are considered to have maximum explosive potential for gunpowder. By that time, the Chinese had discovered how to create explosive round shot by packing their hollow shells with this nitrate-enhanced gunpowder.Needham, Joseph (1986), Science & Civilisation in China, V:7: The Gunpowder Epic, Cambridge University Press, p. 264, 293-294, 345, . Navy Battles of 1277 involved massive naval forces on both sides. In the last battle near Guangzhou in 1279, which had been the last temporary capital of the Song dynasty, the Yuan captured more than 800 warships. The Yuan was unusually sea-minded, attempting numerous maritime expeditions. After the Mongol invasions of Japan (1274, 900 ships, and in 1281, 4400 ships), Mongol invasion of Champa (1282), Mongol invasion of Java (1292, 1000 ships), in 1291 the Yuan attempted but did not ultimately proceed with an invasion of the Ryukyu Islands. However, none of these invasions were successful. Kublai contemplated launching a third invasion of Japan but was forced to back down due to fierce public disapproval. The Yuan era naval advances has been described as a successor of the Song dynasty achievements and an antecedent of the Ming's treasure fleets. An important function of the Yuan navy was the shipping of grain from the South to the capital of modern-day Beijing. There was fierce 50-year interdepartmental rivalry between the fleets shipping by the Grand Canal and shipping by the Yellow Sea, which ended with the eventual dominance of the Grand Canal in China until modern times. The failed invasions also demonstrated a weakness of the Mongols ‚Äì the inability to mount naval invasions successfully Shortly after the Mongol invasions of Japan (1274‚Äì1281), the Japanese produced a scroll painting depicting a bomb. Called tetsuhau in Japanese, the bomb is speculated to have been the Chinese thunder crash bomb.Stephen Turnbull (19 February 2013). The Mongol Invasions of Japan 1274 and 1281. Osprey Publishing. pp 41‚Äì42. . Retrieved 6 September 2016. Archaeological evidence of the use of gunpowder was finally confirmed when multiple shells of the explosive bombs were discovered in an underwater shipwreck off the shore of Japan by the Kyushu Okinawa Society for Underwater Archaeology. X-rays by Japanese scientists of the excavated shells provided proof that they contained gunpowder. File:Ser Marco Polo Ancient Chinese War Vessel.jpgDrawing of a 14th-century Yuan junk.

Ghanaians in Germany are said to form the second largest of the country‚Äôs diaspora populations in Europe, after the United Kingdom.  History  Even before Ghana's independence in 1957, there has been a relationship between Ghana and Germany. The Volta Region of Ghana was part of the German colony of Togo before World War I. In 1957, 44 Ghanaian students were registered in West German universities through a policy that allowed Africans to build skills in German universities. In the 1960s and 70s, most of the Ghanaian migrants to Germany were education migrants. They formed local associations in the university towns and cities in Germany, which in turn became the Union of Ghanaian Students in Germany (UGSG). In 2009, according to Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Technische Zusammenarbeit (GTZ), there were about 40,000 'Ghanaians with a migration background' in Germany; where 'Ghanaians with a migration background' means 'naturalised persons of Ghanaian origin' and 'the second and third generation of Ghanaians naturalised in Germany and the children from binational partnerships who did not immigrate on their own'. Almost 9,729 children were born to German-Ghanaian couples between 1965 ad 2006. In 2007, 20,329 persons with Ghanaian citizenship were officially registered in Germany, 8,194 Ghanaian citizens became German citizens between 1980 and 2007. Currently, Ghana maintains good relations with Germany and there is a large Ghanaian community in Germany, many of whom go there for educational migration, asylum-seeking migration and family reunification.  Distribution  Ghanaians in Germany mostly live in the metropolises of Hamburg, Berlin and Bremen, the Ruhr region, and the Frankfurt/Main metropolitan area. 22.7% of Ghanaian migrants, the highest percentage, live in the city of Hamburg. Also, 23.8% of the Ghanaians living in Germany live in North Rhine-Westphalia. 9.2% of Ghanaian citizens in Germany live in Berlin. 9.8% live in the federal state of Hesse. There has been a long tradition of Ghanaians migrating to Hamburg, hence the concentration of Ghanaians there. In Ghana, the word ‚Äòbooga‚Äô or ‚Äòburger‚Äô, used to refer to migrants, has roots in the name ‚ÄòHamburg‚Äô.  Associations  In June 2004, through an initiative of the Ghanaian Embassy in Germany, the Union of Ghanaian Associations in Germany (UGAG) was formed to include all Ghanaian associations in Germany. The first attempt in 1996 had failed. Church communities are among the most influential formations as Christianity is the largest religion in Ghana. Ghana Catholic Mission-Hamburg, the Bethel Church- Stuttgart and the Presbyterian Church of Cologne are the best-known Ghanaian churches in Germany.  Remittances  Ghana is now one of the top recipients of remittances from its global diaspora. Private remittances make up over one- sixth of the countries gross domestic product. In a survey, 90% of Ghanaians transfer money to Ghana for their families. Some even send more than half their income and go into debt.  Culture  = Music = From the late 1970s to the early 1980s, a genre of music came up in Germany and Ghana called Burger Highlife ‚Äì fusion of highlife, and funk music styles. Ghanaian immigrants in Germany created it.  Living in Germany  = Education = For Ghanaians hoping to study in Germany, the West African Secondary School Certificate Examination (WASSCE) can't be used for direct entry into a German university as it would be used in Ghana. A student has to complete one year of tertiary education in Ghana or complete a one-year preparatory course (Studienkolleg) in Germany. Also, there are no HND top-up courses in Germany. Ghanaians would have to apply for the Bachelor's degree in a university of applied sciences. = Other aspects of living and working = Ghanaians migrants and visitors like other nationalities have to book a hotel for short stays or rent or buy a home for a more extended stay. Learning the German language is required for professions like nursing and healthcare. Ghanaians that start their own businesses in Germany, like everyone else, need to register with the trade office if they are self employed or the tax office if they want to work as freelancers.

The M√©tis Nation of Ontario (MNO) is the official political organization that represents M√©tis people in Ontario. It consists of representatives at the provincial and local levels which represent local M√©tis populations' interests and share their concerns in discussions with governments at all levels. The Supreme Court of Canada ruling in R. vs. Powley (2003) was influential in determining not only M√©tis identity in Ontario and recognizing the historic M√©tis community at Sault Ste. Marie, but it also gave the M√©tis the right to exist across Canada.  History of M√©tis people in Ontario  Mixed Indigenous-European populations have existed in Ontario since the arrival of fur traders into the northwestern Great Lakes and northeastern Ontario in the 1600s. The two major fur trading companies, the Hudson's Bay Company and the North West Company, both banned employees from having relationships with Indigenous women, but that did not stop some of the men from doing so.Brown, J.

While many M√©tis were of French descent, there was a significant Anglo-M√©tis population around the Great Lakes and James Bay areas. They were the result of marriages √† la fa√ßon du pays between Indigenous women and English or Scottish fur traders and British soldiers.Campbell, S. \\"\\"I shall settle, marry, and trade here\\": British military personnel and their mixed-blood descendants.\\" (2007).

Some scholars agree that the M√©tis community in Red River is descended from this group.Andersen, C.

Retrieved from https://doi.org/10.1215/00141801-2010-063. Whether or not the M√©tis community in Ontario self-identified as M√©tis at the time is a matter of serious dispute. The rise in the self-identification of M√©tis in Ontario today challenges the common narrative that the M√©tis community developed solely in the Red River area. It can be argued that calling the mixed community \\"M√©tis\\" is an act of placing a colonial label based on racial differences, not on socio-cultural attributes. While the concept of M√©tis as a nation can be linked to the resistances in Red River in 1870 and 1885, the seeds for nationalism were sown in the mixed populations that were pushed into Red River as European settlers advanced westward in Ontario.  History of the MNO  The predecessor of the MNO is the Ontario M√©tis and Non-Status Indian Association (OMNSIA), which was created in the 1970s as part of the Native Council of Canada (NCC). The NCC was created by Tony Belcourt and other important M√©tis political representatives to ensure M√©tis rights and voices were recognized and heard by federal and provincial governments as the new Canadian constitution was drafted. The M√©tis Nation Council was created in 1983 as the sole voice of the M√©tis because they felt they were drowned out by \\"non-Status Indians\\" in the NCC. The M√©tis Nation of Ontario was born in 1994, along with associations in other provinces and territories, to provide a political platform for the M√©tis population in Ontario. This was first tested in 2003 in the now-famous R. vs. Powley (2003) Supreme Court of Canada ruling that recognized the M√©tis as Indigenous people with rights to hunt and fish in accordance with their traditional lifestyles and developed a test of M√©tis identity now known as the \\"Powley test\\". This contrasted with a definition developed by the MNO which focuses on self-identification as M√©tis, having at least one Indigenous grandparent, and whose application was accepted by the MNO.Reimer, G., & Chartrand, J. (2004). Documenting Historic Metis in Ontario. Ethnohistory, 51(3), 567-607.  Structure  The MNO governance structure is set up in a style similar to a democratically elected, provincial government. It is the only official provincial representative for M√©tis people in Ontario and seeks to advance the cause of M√©tis rights and complaints of the people through agreements with the federal and provincial governments. Leaders are elected at the provincial level and for each of the 30 Community Councils every four years which provide regional representation of local M√©tis communities. The Community Councils serve as the main connection point between MNO citizens and the provincial leadership. Assistance and resources are provided by the MNO to the Community Councils to carry out their mandates and making sure they are managed well.\\"MNO Chartered Community Councils.\\" (2019).

Contemporary issues  The MNO got into trouble in November 2018 at the Annual General Meeting of the M√©tis National Council. It claimed that 90% of M√©tis registered with the MNO did not fulfill the requirements of citizenship put in place by the Council in 2002, requiring an ancestral link to the M√©tis homeland. The borders of the homeland had not been previously agreed upon, though it was generally accepted that it extended into parts of Ontario due to the Powley decision. The 90% figure is often taken out of context, but refers to f√©tis on the registry with no connection to Red River. As a result, the MNO was placed on probation for one year. A review of the MNO registry is being undertaken with no previous members included based on past membership. The MNO Chair disputes the probation, saying the Council does not have final authority over them. They do not plan on removing any of their members from their registry.\\"M√©tis Nation of Ontario Chair: 90% of MNO members do not meet MNC citizenship requirements.\\" (August 29th, 2019).

The MNO celebrated a major milestone with an agreement signed with the federal government in June 2019, promising the M√©tis in Ontario more self-governance. This was disputed by certain people within the MNO, including the president of the Sudbury M√©tis Council, Maurice Sarrazin, who cited the ruling by the M√©tis National Council the year before as the reason why the MNO is not the best representative for the M√©tis in Ontario.

The type and only species is Gnathovorax cabreirai, described by Pacheco et al. in 2019. The type specimen comprises a mostly complete and well-preserved articulated skeleton (considered one of the best herrerasaurid skeletons ever discovered), which fossilized in close association with rhynchosaur and cynodont remains. The discovery of this superb specimen has shed light onto poorly understood aspects of herrerasaurid anatomy such as endocranial soft tissues.  Discovery  Location and fauna of the Marchezan site The holotype specimen, CAPPA/UFSM 0009, is an almost complete and partially articulated skeleton, lacking only portions of the left shoulder girdle and left forelimb. It was found in 2014 at the Marchezan site, in the municipality of S√£o Jo√£o do Pol√™sine, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. This locality preserved rocks from Santa Maria Formation in the Candel√°ria Sequence of the Paran√° Basin. The skeleton was fossilized within a mudstone layer, along with small articulated skeletons of prozostrodont cynodonts. This mudstone layer was then covered by a layer of sandstone containing disarticulated rhynchosaur remains. These fossil remains are indicative of a diverse community of animals at Marchezan. Stratigraphically correlated beds from a nearby site were dated as the middle of the Carnian stage of the Late Triassic, circa 233.23 ¬± 0.73 million years ago. The monospecific genus was named and described by Cristian Pacheco, Rodrigo Temp M√ºller, Max Langer, Fl√°vio Augusto Pretto, Leonardo Kerber and S√©rgio Dias da Silva in an article published in 2019. The generic name is derived from the Greek gnathos, jaw, and the Latin vorax, \\"voracious\\", from vor≈ç (‚Äúdevour‚Äù) + ‚àíƒÅx (‚Äúinclined to‚Äù). The specific epithet was given in honour of Dr. S√©rgio Furtado Cabreira, the palaeontologist who found the specimen.  Description  = Skull = Skull reconstruction There were three teeth in the premaxilla, in contrast to Herrerasaurus (which possessed four). The contact between the premaxilla and maxilla encompassed two fenestrae (holes): a subnarial fenestra which was situated low on the snout and an additional smaller fenestra positioned above it. While a subnarial fenestra is common in herrerasaurids and theropods, the additional fenestra is unique to Gnathovorax. Like other archosaurs, a small basin known as the antorbital fossa is present in front of the antorbital fenestra. Many early saurischians have a hole called the promaxillary fenestra situated on the antorbital fossa, but this hole is absent in Gnathovorax. On the other hand, Gnathovorax does possess a characteristic thin ridge edging an additional emargination within the antorbital fossa; a small depression is present between this ridge and the ridge forming the border of the antorbital fossa. The lower branch of the lacrimal is slender and extends to the middle of the lower edge of the orbit (eye socket), similar to Daemonosaurus but different from Herrerasaurus. Most other aspects of the skull, such as the thick squamosal, expanded front branch of the jugal, the shape of the infratemporal fenestra, and a lack of palatal teeth, are most similar to herrerasaurids among early dinosaurs. The supraoccipital bone at the top of the braincase is trapezoidal when seen from behind (unlike Herrerasaurus's triangular supraoccipital) and has a blade-like crest on top. The occipital condyle is also thicker, the basioccipital has a V-shaped (rather than U-shaped) contact with the parabasisphenoid, and the paroccipital processes are larger in Gnathovorax compared to Herrerasaurus. Otherwise the braincase is similar between the two taxa. The dentary lacks sauropodomorph qualities and instead likely possessed a sliding joint at the chin similar to other herrerasaurids, although preservation is not good enough to fully confirm this. The 3 premaxillary, 19 maxillary, and 14 dentary teeth are all thin, curved, and blade-like. There are serrations on the distal (rear) edge of all the teeth, and the maxillary teeth also have serrations on the mesial (front) edge. = Postcrania = Pelvis and hindlimbs Skeletal reconstruction of Gnathovorax cabreirai. Known elements in white and unknown in dark gray. The neck is short, with keels along the lower edge of its vertebrae (like other herrerasaurids) and long transverse processes (like Sanjuansaurus specifically). The dorsal vertebrae are similar to those of other herrerasaurids, though the tips of the neural spines are only slightly expanded. As with herrerasaurids and most non-dinosaur reptiles, only two vertebrae form the sacrum. However, Gnathovorax also has its last dorsal vertebra encompassed by the ilium (upper hip plate), although its transverse processes are not long enough to contact the ilium; therefore, it does not qualify as a sacral vertebra. The tail vertebrae are most similar to Herrerasaurus, with low and elongated zygapophyses, upwards-pointing neural spines, and transverse processes which are semicircular in cross section. Gnathovorax is the only herrerasaurid combining features of the scapula such as posterior curvature, an expanded tip, and no fusion with the coracoid. The rest of the forearm is similar to that of Herrerasaurus, with a strongly developed elbow area and a long hand. The ilium is short, although it has a pointed front tip in contrast with the rounded front edge of other herrerasaurids. Gnathovorax is the only herrerasaurid in which the pubis is both sinuous in front view, and projects straight down in side view. The pubis also possesses a large pubic boot with a smooth lower edge, similar to other herrerasaurids, although it lacks the beveled pubic booth of Staurikosaurus. Unlike other herrerasaurids (but like lagerpetids), the ischium has a hole known as an obturator foramen at its base. The femoral head is more simple than that of other herrerasaurids, with a small craniomedial tuber (front inner bump) and no caudomedial tuber (rear inner bump). Otherwise the femur possesses all the muscle attachment sites typical of basal dinosaurs. The tibia is 90% the length of the femur, unlike Staurikosaurus which has a longer tibia. The rest of the lower leg is similar to Herrerasaurus, but the foot has three phalanges (toe bone) in the fifth toe, while Herrerasaurus only has one. Classification Gnathovorax was a member of the Herrerasauridae, a group of small to medium-sized carnivorous dinosaurs. The paper describing Gnathovorax contained a cladistic analysis which argued that the Herrerasauridae are basal Saurischia, outside of the Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha. Within Herrerasauridae, Gnathovorax was found in a polytomy with Herrerasaurus and Sanjuansaurus.https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/laelaps/stunning-skeleton- reveals-early-carnivorous-dinosaur/  Paleobiology  Braincase and virtual endocast The holotype skeleton of Gnathovorax is so well preserved that its describers were able to reconstruct a digital endocast of the brain. It possessed a large floccular fossa lobe (FFL) of the cerebellum, a portion of the brain generally (but not universally) considered useful for motor control of the eye, head, and neck. These features mean that most paleontologists consider a large FFL to be indicative of an active predatory lifestyle, explaining why it is reduced in later sauropodomorphs but not in most theropods. This soft tissue data provided by Gnathovorax is congruent with other evidence for carnivory in herrerasaurids, such as the structure of their teeth and claws. The tooth proportions of herrerasaurids and basal carnivorous sauropodomorphs each overlap slightly with theropods according to a morphological variation analysis, but herrerasaurids and sauropodomorphs do not overlap with each other. It is inferred that during the Carnian stage of the Triassic, herrerasaurids occupied large predatory niches while small basal sauropodomorphs occupied small carnivorous and omnivorous niches. After the extinction of herrerasaurids and carnivorous sauropodomorphs in the Norian, theropods became the dominant predatory dinosaurs at multiple size tiers, encouraging sauropodomorphs to acquire larger, more herbivory-focused ecologies.

He played for South Sydney in the NRL competition. Background Alley-Tovio was a South Sydney junior and holds the record for most tries in a Jersey Flegg game when he scored 6 tries against Balmain in the Jersey Flegg Cup. Playing career Alley-Tovio made his first grade debut for South Sydney in round 10 2003 against Cronulla-Sutherland at Shark Park which ended in a 14‚Äì30 loss. Alley-Tovio played 2 further games for Souths in the 2003 NRL season as the club finished last on the table. In the 2004 NRL season, Alley-Tovio only made one appearance for Souths which came against Canterbury-Bankstown in round 7 with the match finishing in an 8‚Äì34 loss. Souths would finish last on the table for a second consecutive year and this would prove to be Alley-Tovio's last game in the top grade. After being released by Souths, Alley-Tovio played in reserve grade for the Canberra Raiders, St. George Illawarra, Newtown, Canterbury-Bankstown and Penrith. Controversy In 2007, Alley-Tovio agreed to hand himself in to police after allegedly assaulting three men inside a hotel and fleeing in a stolen car. It was reported that a fight began at the Rydges Hotel in Parramatta after Alley- Tovio knocked over a tray of drinks. After a fight broke out, Alley-Tovio was ejected out of the hotel by security staff. He then allegedly ran across James Ruse Drive, dodging traffic, and got into a car which was pulled over with the keys in the ignition, but unoccupied. The car was later dumped outside Maroubra police station with the keys in the ignition. Alley-Tovio was suspended by his club Canterbury who he was playing with at the time and was subsequently released.

Amongst the many roles she created were Almazie in Isouard's Aladin ou La lampe merveilleuse and Aurora in Carafa's La belle au bois dormant. Life and career Grassari was born Marie-Caroline-Josephine G√©rard in Tongeren, Belgium, where she was baptised on 15 June 1795. Her father was , a highly decorated French general. Her mother, Anne-Christine Tournay, was the daughter of Tongeren's Burgomaster. Her parents divorced in her childhood and she initially lived with her mother in Belgium, where she began her musical studies. In 1814, she was sent to Paris under the care of her father and finished her studies at the Conservatoire de Paris. She made her stage debut under the name \\"Mademoiselle Grassari\\" at the Paris Op√©ra on 13 February 1816 singing Antigone in Sacchini's ≈ídipe √† Colone. She was then given a permanent position at the Op√©ra as premier remplacement, singing the roles of the primadonnas when they were unavailable as well as secondary roles. However, she soon rose to the first rank of singers and went on to create numerous leading roles for the company, including Aurora in Carafa's La belle au bois dormant and Elzire in Liszt's Don Sanche. In April 1819 she also sang in the Op√©ra's first and only performance of Maximilian Stadler's oratorio La D√©livrance de J√©rusalem. Grassari was described in contemporary accounts as uniting a beautiful voice with compelling acting and a charming stage presence. She was particularly admired for her performances as Amazily in Spontini's Fernand Cortez and the title role in M√©hul's Stratonice. One of Grassari's last performances at the Op√©ra was in May 1827 as Pamina in Les myst√®res d'Isis, a pastiche opera by Ludwig Wenzel Lachnith based on the story of Mozart's Die Zauberfl√∂te. Faced with enormous deficits in 1828, √âmile Lubbert, the new director of the Op√©ra, gave notice to Henri-√âtienne D√©rivis that his contract would not be renewed and asked Grassari to retire early. She was paid 30,000 francs to cancel her contract. According to her father's death certificate, she was still alive when he died in September 1832. Earlier that year articles had appeared in Gazette des Tribunaux and Giornale del Regno delle Due Sicilie describing a lawsuit which she brought against her former protector and lover, Jean- Fran√ßois Levrat, whom she accused of using her pension from the Op√©ra to pay off his creditors. Apart from those articles, news of her disappeared completely from the French press after her retirement. Arthur Pougin wrote in 1906 that despite an extensive search, he was unable to find any publication of the date of her death, a fact which he found remarkable given her considerable fame during the twelve years she was on the stage. Roles created Grassari's performances in world premieres at the Paris Op√©ra included: Grassari as Almasie in Aladin ou La lampe merveilleuse *Parth√©nope in Les dieux rivaux ou Les f√™tes de Cyth√®re (opera-ballet in 1 act) jointly composed by Berton, Kreutzer, Loiseau de Persuis and Spontini; 21 June 1816 (marking the marriage of the Duke of Berry) *Alexis in Nathalie ou La famille russe (opera in 3 acts) composed by Reicha; 30 July 1816 *Aspasie in Aspasie et P√©ricl√®s (opera in 1 act) composed by Daussoigne-M√©hul; 17 July 1820 *Almasie in Aladin ou La lampe merveilleuse (opera in 5 acts) composed by Isouard; 6 February 1822 *Virginie in Virginie ou Les D√©cemvirs (opera in 3 acts) composed by Berton; 11 June 1823 *Lasth√©nie in Lasth√©nie (opera in 1 act) composed by H√©rold; 8 September 1823 *La Reine in Vend√¥me en Espagne (opera in 1 act) jointly composed by Auber and H√©rold; 5 December 1823 (marking the return of the Duke of Angoul√™me from Spain) *Z√©naire in Ipsibo√© (opera in 4 acts) composed by Kreutzer; 31 March 1824 *Zul√©ma in Les deux Salem (opera in 1 act) composed by Daussoigne-M√©hul; 12 July 1824 *Aurora in La belle au bois dormant (opera in 3 acts) composed by Carafa; 2 March 1825 *Ph√©dora in Pharamond (opera in 3 acts) jointly composed by Boieldieu, Berton, and Kreutzer; 10 June 1825 (marking the coronation of Charles X) *Elzire in Don Sanche, ou Le ch√¢teau de l'amour (opera in 1 act) composed by Liszt; 17 October 1825 Notes References Category:1795 births Category:19th- century deaths Category:Belgian operatic sopranos Category:People from Tongeren Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni ","title":"Caroline Grassari"},{"id":"62286811","text":"David H. Webber is the author of The Rise of the Working Class Shareholder: Labor's Last Best Weapon and Associate Dean for Intellectual Life at Boston University School of Law, where he writes about shareholder activism and litigation. Biography Webber graduated from Columbia University magna cum laude with a B.A. in history and earned his Juris Doctor from New York University School of Law, where he was an editor for the New York University Law Review. Webber joined the faculty at Boston University School of Law in 2010 and became the Associate Dean for Intellectual Life in July 2019. He also co-teaches a class on Pensions and Capital Stewardship in the Trade Union Program at Harvard Law School. He has appeared on C-SPAN's Book TV Minnesota Public Radio's Marketplace, the David Feldman Show, The David Pakman Show, the Social Europe podcast, and Knowledge@Wharton Business Radio, and written opinion pieces for The New York Times, The Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times. Scholarship =The Rise of the Working-Class Shareholder: Labor's Last Best Weapon= In this nonfiction book, Webber argues that public pension plans can use their voice as shareholders, both publicly and privately to individual board members, to influence corporate decision making. He asserts public pension plans are better positioned to do this than other shareholders because they do not have as many conflicts of interest and as long-term shareholders, their interests are aligned with the long-term interests of a company. However, labor may also be able to collaborate with other shareholders to achieve mutually beneficial ends. Although pension plans have a duty to act in workers' best interests, \\"Webber makes a good case that there is no logical reason always to define those workers' interests narrowly, as just their future retirement benefits.\\" Where employee contributors' current jobs are threatened by the actions of an wiktionary:investee, it would be in the contributors' best interests to influence the investee's actions even if it ultimately results in a lower return for the pension plan. Criticism of expanding workers' interests beyond return on investment is that some private sector workers would receive a lower retirement return in order to help other workers in the present. For public retirees receiving defined benefit pensions, taxpayers have to pay the difference if returns are lower due to activist activities. (Reviewing David Webber, The Rise of the Working- Class Shareholder: Labor's Last Best Weapon (Harvard University Press, 2018)). Webber has identified multiple threats to this kind of shareholder activism, including moves from centrally-managed pension plans to individual 401(k)s and Janus v. American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, Council 31, which held that unions cannot collect fees from non-union members. Webber believes these threats have been championed by Conservatives, including the Koch Brothers, for political gain. A narrow definition of fiduciary duty to the fund, as opposed to the beneficiaries, under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and state retirement plan laws is another threat. This issue has not yet been taken up by the Supreme Court of the United States. Benjamin Friedman notes, \\"[w]hat Webber's book presents is not a legal argument but rather an economic and political one, and recent experience suggests that economic and especially political arguments count for a lot in determining what the Justices decide on any given issue before them.\\" The Rise of the Working-Class Shareholder: Labor's Last Best Weapon has been reviewed in The New York Review of Books, the Financial Times,, Forbes,, Dissent, Cornell University's Industrial and Labor Relations Review, and Publishers Weekly. Webber's book tour included over 40 stops across the United States, including the Los Angeles Times Festival of Books, as well as talks in Belgium, Portugal, England, and Israel. =Shareholder activism and litigation= Webber has been invited to speak on shareholder activism by academic institutions, labor groups, and lawyers associations worldwide. He believes shareholder activism is important because corporations are very powerful, and their actions impact everyday citizens just as much as government action. Webber has also expressed concerns about the possible effects if class actions were not available for shareholder litigation, noting this would create a system where institutional investors could recover for wrongs perpetrated by a corporation, but smaller investors would not pursue relief on their own. (Citing David Webber, Shareholder Litigation Without Class Actions, 57 Ariz. L. Rev. 201, 217 (2015)). He has been critical of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act, because in determining the most adequate plaintiff, it favors investors with a larger dollar amount interest in the outcome over investors whose interest is a larger percentage of their assets. Webber feels the latter may be more committed to aggressively pursuing economic relief, and has suggested courts should select a representative individual investor to serve as a co-lead plaintiff with a larger institutional investor. He has found that institutional investors, such as Fidelity, Vanguard, and TIAA-CREF often avoid being a lead plaintiff because they are concerned competitors will benefit from the litigation without contributing to the costs. Hedge funds, which also may have extensive resources invested, often avoid being the lead plaintiff because they do not want to be subject to discovery demands that would expose their investing strategies. (Citing David H. Webber, Shareholder Litigation Without Class Actions, 57 Ariz. L. Rev. 201 (2015)). He has also asserted that when corporations require arbitration of shareholder claims, the goal is to shift the cost-benefit analysis so that it does not seem worthwhile to bring the claim. Webber has examined data to determine whether pay-to-play impacts which law firms represent pension funds in securities litigation, and found that politically controlled pensions are less likely to seek lead plaintiff appointments than pensions whose board members are also pension beneficiaries. However this study has been criticized for not looking at law firm campaign contributions. Other studies have found a relationship between law firm campaign contributions and their selection as lead counsel by those elected officials. =Mergers and acquisitions= Webber has conducted empirical research into who brings lawsuits to challenge mergers and acquisitions in Delaware, and found pension funds are often the lead plaintiffs in these suits. (Citing David H. Webber, Private Policing of Mergers and Acquisitions: An Empirical Assessment of Institutional Lead Plaintiffs in Transactional Class and Derivative Actions, 38 Del. J. Corp. L. 907, 960-61 (2014)). He also found that when institutional investors are named as the lead plaintiffs, it is more likely that the final price will exceed the initial offer and there are lower attorneys' fees.

Paramyxoviridae viruses were first isolated from bats using heminested PCR with degenerate primers. This process was then followed by Sanger sequencing. A specific location of this virus is not known because it was isolated from bats worldwide. Although multiple paramyxoviridae viruses have been isolated worldwide, BMV specifically has not been isolated thus far. However, BMV was detected in African fruit bats, but no infectious form has been isolated to date. It is known that BMV is transmitted through saliva in the respiratory system of bats. While the virus was considered its own species for a few years, phylogenetic analysis has since shown that it is a member of Mumps orthorubulavirus.  Classification  The Paramyxoviridae family can be divided in several genera, all negative strand RNA viruses. They include Rubulavirus, Henipavirus, Respirovirus, Morbillivirus, Ferlavirus, Aquaparamyxovirus, and Abulavirus. The rubulavirus genus can then be divided into two main groups, based on the type of pathogen. Rubulavirus genus contains human pathogens, as well as bat-borne pathogens. Examples of the human viruses include the following: parainfluenza virus (hPIV) and mumps virus (MuV), and examples of the bat-borne viruses are: Mapuera (MapV), Bat Mumps Rubulavirus (BMV), and Menangle (MenPV).  Virus structure  This is an image of the genome of Bat Mumps Rubulavirus, which consists of N, V, P, M, F, SH, HN, and L proteins in addition to a 3-inch leader sequence and a 5-inch trailer sequence. Bat mumps rubulavirus (BMV) is a spherical shaped negative sense single stranded RNA virus. Some researchers have noted a pleomorphic structure. BMV is about 15kb in size, with a diameter of about 150nm. This virus also contains an envelope, derived from the host cell. In addition, Rubulavirus has cell attachment glycoprotein, important in mediating viral entry, with neuraminidase and haemagglutinin capability. A ribonucleocapsid is present inside the virus.  Virus genome  The BMV is composed of a linear genome, with a monopartite segmentation, meaning there is a single molecule of nucleic acid, as opposed to multiple molecules. In other words, the genome is non-segmented since it only has the one molecule. Because of this, the genome cannot undergo generic reassortment, so no antigenic shift can occur. RNA- dependent RNA polymerase does not have a function to be able to check for errors in coding, so many mutations are possible in the transcription process. It was initially assumed by researchers that antigenic stability would not be possible due to having these mechanisms occurring, but it has been noted that there is antigenic stability due to the fact that there are so many proteins, each having their own roles. So, any mutation would lead to a reduced ability to function, then creating a less efficient virus, which is not favorable for the virus. BMV encodes a nucleoprotein, encoded by gene N; a phosphoprotein, encoded by gene P; a V protein, a matrix protein, encoded by M; a fusion protein, encoded by F; and a large polymerase subunit, encoded by L. In addition, the unedited P gene contains the V protein. The order from left to right is the leader region, followed by the nucelocapsid, then the phosphoprotein, then the matrix protein, followed by the fusion protein, then the large polymerase, and finally the trailer sequence. The addition of 2 non- templated G residues of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase is necessary for expressing the phosphoprotein, in order for viral replication and synthesis to occur since it is a negative single-stranded RNA virus. BMV (as well as a parainfluenza virus known as PIV5) contain short hydrophobic proteins, which have a role in blocking the TNFalpha-mediated apoptosis pathway. In terms of gene expression, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase binds the encapsulated genome at the leader region, which starts the transcription process. The 3‚Äô leader sequence is approximately 50 nucleotides in length, and this is the area acting as the transcriptional promoter. The 5‚Äô trailer sequence (at the opposite end of the leader sequence) is between 50 and 161 nucleotides in length. There are intergenomic regions between each gene, which are usually between 1 and 56 nucleotides long for BMV. mRNAs are capped and polyadenylated by the L protein, and the V protein is created through editing the P mRNA gene, as mentioned earlier.  Virus replication cycle and interaction with the host  The replication cycle for BMV has not been studied; however, the replication cycle of the rubulavirus genus as a whole has been studied, so the information listed below is regarding the entire rubulavirus genus. The replication cycle is cytoplasmic.  Entry into cell  In order for rubulavirus to enter into a host cell, it must first attach on to the host cell's receptors. This process is done using the glycoprotein structure that the virus contains. The specific receptors used in this process for BMV are unknown, but it has been noted that the BMV virus attaches to the host cell surface receptors via the HN glycoprotein. This is done by using the neuraminidase and haemagglutinin capability, as described above. BMV requires the expression of sialic acids on its surface of target cells and the F protein must be cleaved in order for host cell binding, and then entry can occur. Next, fusion with the plasma membrane occurs, and the ribonucleocapsid from inside the virus is released into the cytoplasm of the host cell.  Replication and transcription  It is in the cytoplasm, and at this point in the replication process, that the viral mRNAs are capped and polyadenylated. This can be called sequential transcription. It should also be noted that the purpose of the polyadenylation is to increase the half-life of the protein in order to increase the regulation of the activity. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase binds to the RNA genome in order for this transcription to occur.  Assembly and release  Further, assembly of the virus begins when there is enough nucleoprotein (N) present to encapsulate neo-synthetized antigenomes and genomes. The virus, or more specifically, the ribonucleocapsid, interacts with the matrix (M) protein in the plasma membrane. Next, budding occurs via the ESCRT complex, and the virion is released at this point in the replication cycle.  Associated diseases  There was recently a new discovery of a paramyxovirus first isolated from a fruit bat in the Democratic Republic of Congo that has been confirmed to be closely related to the mumps virus in the Rubulavirus genus. Some paramyxoviridae viruses have been discovered to have the ability to affect humans, so there is high zoonotic potential that the BMV virus can affect humans due to the similarity between that and the human mumps virus. Specifically, the fusion protein and hemagglutinin and neuraminidase proteins of the envelope, have been recognized to be similar, both serologically and functionally, between these two viruses. Those proteins are the targets for the neutralizing antibodies in the viruses. Due to those similar areas being the neutralizing targets within the two viruses, there is cross-neutralization between the two viruses. The neutralizing antibodies play a role in protection of the virus, and it has been noted that patients who had antibodies either from the vaccines or infection of the human mumps virus are able to neutralize the bat-borne mumps virus in an efficient manner. The current vaccine for human mumps may actually play a role in reducing the risk of infection from bat-borne mumps virus, or BMV. In other words, BMV may be a potential threat to the unvaccinated human population. Future studies should focus on studying how bat mumps virus interacts with human mumps virus.  Tropism  Tropism in bats for BMV has not been specifically studied thus far. However, it is known that Bat Mumps Rubulavirus initially infects the respiratory system in bats. Although no studies on bats have been completed, it is known that the bat mumps virus is closely related to the human mumps virus. So, the following information is regarding the human mumps virus, but can potentially be applied to BMV. Mumps typically infects the respiratory system first, in addition to causing inflammation in the parotid glands. It can also cause orchitis in men, and meningitis, pancreatitis, and deafness in some cases. A number of individuals infected with mumps can be asymptomatic as well. Other symptoms can sometimes include fatigue, joint or muscle pain, and loss of appetite. Other possible mammalian host cells can include those of apes, pigs, and dogs, in addition to humans.  Outbreaks  Since there is the potential for Bat Mumps Rubulavirus to infect humans, it is unclear how much BMV has contributed to the human mumps cases in recent years. There is no evidence of recent outbreaks of BMV in bats, but it is possible this virus has contributed to the large number of outbreaks of mumps in humans. Outbreaks of human mumps have been on the rise in recent years since 2016, being higher than any numbers since 2006. Outbreaks were present in states such as Washington, New York, Oklahoma, Indiana, and some counties in Michigan. An increase in the human population has been noted to be a factor in the possibility of BMV having spillover into humans. As the population grows and humans build on new land, there is the possibility of having contact of land that has been infested by bats infected with BMV. Consumption of ecological resources can almost ensure that we will continue to see spillovers of zoonotic viruses from animal hosts, including that of BMV from fruit bats.

Yokose virus is a new member of the Flavivirus family that has only been identified in a few bat species. Bats have been associated with several emerging zoonotic diseases such as Ebola and SARS.  Viral classification  A picture of Mount Also, located on Kyushu Island Japan, where Yokose virus was first isolated. Yokose virus is in the genus Flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae. It was identified in 1971 in Yokosuka, Kyushu Island, Japan. The strain Oita-36 was isolated from bat species Miniopterus fuliginosus. Molecular genetic analysis has shown that Yokose virus is a new member of the Flavivirus genus. Flaviviruses are typically divided into three groups: mosquito borne, tick borne, or non-vector. Yokose virus is classified as NKV, or no-known vector. This means that it has no known arthropod vector. However, there is some evidence suggests that it may infect arthropods, namely being mediated by mosquitos. Yokose virus has been found to be genetically close to Yellow Fever virus with amino acid sequences showing close identify to Entebbe Bat virus.  Viral structure and genome  Yokose virus is a positive sense single-stranded RNA virus. It is enveloped and has icosohedral symmetry with a triangulation number (T) of 3. It is roughly 50 nm in diameter.The genome is non-segmented and contains 10,857 nucleotides. There is one open reading frame (ORF) of 3425 amino acid polyprotein that encodes three structural proteins and eight non-structural proteins. The structural proteins include capsid (C), premembrane/membrane (prM), and envelope (E). The non- structural proteins include NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, 2K, NS4B, and NS5. Protein 2K is not found in many other flaviviruses. NS3 functions as a protease and helicase. NS5 functions as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. NS1 is important in the viral replication process. NS2A interacts with NS3 and NS5, helps in viral assembly and recruits the viral RNA genome to membrane- bound replication complex. Secondary structures formed by 5' and 3' of non- translating region (NTR) influence transcription and translation. Yokose virus has a CS1 motif in the 3' NTR which is conserved in mosquito-borne flaviviruses suggesting ability to infect arthropods.  Replication cycle  = Entry into cell = The viral envelope protein (E) attaches to the host cell receptors and is taken into the cell via endocytosis. The envelope protein then undergoes a conformational change within the endosome upon exposure to the endosome's acidic nature. The envelope protein and the endosomal membrane fuse, and the virus is released into the cytoplasm. = Replication and transcription = The viral RNA is translated into a polyproteinss and then cleaved by viral and cellular proteases into the structural (C, prM, and E) and non-structural proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, 2K, NS4B, and NS5). Replication takes places on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum within the membrane vessicles. A complementary negative sense RNA strand is formed via the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (non- structural protein NS5) to create a double-stranded RNA. The dsRNA is transcribed producing viral mRNAs. = Assembly and release = The virus is assembled within the endoplasmic reticulum. A nucleocapsid is formed and takes up viral glycoproteins. However, very little is understood about the assembly process of Flaviviruses. Evidence suggests that several of the non-structural proteins such as NS2A contributes to assembly. The assembled vision then buds to the Golgi apparatus where the prM protein is cleaved leading to maturation. The virus is then released from the cell via exocytosis and is off to infect other host cells. A fruit bat from the area where Yokose virus antibodies have been found in fruit bats.  Host and location  Much is unknown about the pathogenecity and virulence of Yokose virus including in bats. The strain XYBX1332 isolated in China was found to cause cytopathic effects in mammalian cells. In the study of fruit bats infected with Yokose virus, they did not observe any clinical signs of disease. Currently only species of bats have been identified of carrying Yokose viral strains. The strain Oita-36 was isolated from bat species Miniopterus fuliginosus and is currently the primary strain of Yokose virus. It was identified on Kyushu Island off the coast of Japan. Yokose virus is not geographically limited to Japanese islands, but has been isolated in inland China as well. Strain XYBX1332 was isolated from bat species Myotis daubentonii in Yunnan Province, China. However, this strain has genomic differences compared to the original Oita-36 strain and further research should be conducted to conclude if it is a new species of flavivirus. Antibodies to Yokose virus were found in fruit bats, Rousettus leschenaultii, in the Philippines and Maylasia as well. This shows that Yokose virus is not geographically limited to Japanese islands, but can exist in inland areas of Asia as well. So far there has been no reported infections of Yokose virus in humans or other animals. Researchers found that Yokose can be manipulated to infect human cells and reacts to antibodies of other Flavivirus present within the cells. It was found that Yellow fever vaccination was effective in neutralizing Yokose virus in human cells.  Pathogenicity and virulence  Much is unknown about the pathogenecity and virulence of Yokose virus. The strain XYBX1332 isolated in China was found to cause cytopathic effects in mammalian cells. In the study of fruit bats infected with Yokose virus, they did not observe any clinical signs of disease. However, a study conducted on bat alveolar epithelial cells and kidney cells found that infection of Yokose virus led to viral replication and cell death shortly after.

It is a member of the family of viruses Hepadnaviridae and the genus Orthohepadnavirus. Like the other members of its family, GSHV has high degree of species and tissue specificity. It was discovered in Beechey ground squirrels, Spermophilus beecheyi, but also infects Arctic ground squirrels, Spermophilus parryi. Commonalities between GSHV and HBV include morphology, DNA polymerase activity in genome repair, cross-reacting viral antigens, and the resulting persistent infection with viral antigen in the blood (antigenemia). As a result, GSHV is used as an experimental model for HBV. The species GSHV was originally isolated from, Spermophilus beecheyi, commonly known as California ground squirrel.  Morphology  = Genome = Ground squirrel hepatitis virus consists of a DNA genome is primarily double-stranded. Like other hepadnaviruses, it consists of a single-stranded region of variable length that is converted to double- stranded DNA by virion DNA polymerase. A protein is covalently bound to the 5' end of the minus strand which may be used as a primer for DNA synthesis. There are four evident open reading frames within the genome, all on the same strand. Two are for the genes encoding the structural proteins (surface antigens and core antigens), and the other two are unassigned. The larger of the unassigned frames, which is called gene A and covers 80% of the genome, is predicted to encode the viral DNA polymerase. The shorter one, gene B, does not correspond to a known viral protein. Inside a host cell, the GSHV genome can exist in two forms: a circular duplex and heterogenous partially single- stranded DNA. Circular DNA can be either covalently closed or open. The GSHV genome is very similar to the related hepadnaviruses. Ground squirrel hepatitis is 3311 base pairs in length, making the size indistinguishable from HBV. GSHV has greater nucleotide and amino acid homology with WHV than HBV, with 82% nucleotide and 78% amino acid homology between GSHV and WHV and 55% nucleotide and 46% amino acid homology between GSHV and HBV. The open reading frames of GSHV are similar to HBV and WHV, but the viruses differ in their EcoRI restriction enzyme recognition sites. = Structure = Ground squirrel hepatitis virus is a spherical, enveloped virus. The core particle, or nucleocapsid, contains e antigen, viral DNA, and an endogenous DNA polymerase. The virus particles contain two major structural proteins, surface antigens (sAg) and core antigens (cAg). Both proteins were identified based on homology with analogous proteins in other hepadnaviruses. Mature ground squirrel hepatitis sAg (GSHsAg) had 90% amino acid homology with woodchuck hepatitis sAg and is believed to be glycosylated. The ground squirrel hepatitis cAg (GSHcAg) is the most highly conserved protein sequence between GSHV, WHV, and HBV.  Replication Cycle  = Viral Entry = It is thought that hepadnaviruses enter host cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. = Replication and Transcription = The intracellular predomination of the long minus strand of DNA over the short plus strand suggests DNA replication proceeds from an RNA template, like other hepadnaviruses. It is predicted that synthesis of the minus strand utilizes an RNA intermediate that is degraded as it is copied, and the plus strand is synthesized using the complete minus strand DNA. Viral DNA polymerase synthesizes both the plus and minus DNA strands. The production of an RNA intermediate, called the pregenome, during replication involves a reverse transcription step resembling that of retroviruses. Hepadnaviruses differ from retroviruses in that the intermediate form of the genome is RNA instead of DNA. Also, integration into the host genome is not necessary for replication in hepadnaviruses. This process was first shown in Duck Hepatitis B virus, a related virus in the Hepadnaviridae family in which the minus DNA strands also outnumber the plus strands. This similarity suggests the replication mechanism is similar in GSHV. Following entry, the partial DNA duplex genome is repaired by the viral DNA polymerase and circularized to serve as the template for transcription. The four transcripts are made in the nucleus and are generally transported to the cytoplasm. = Assembly = It is predicted that viral DNA is packaged before synthesis of the plus strand is complete. This would explain the excess minus strand DNA compared to plus strand DNA.  Infection and Disease  Ground squirrel hepatitis virus is distinguished from related viruses by its lack of pathogenic effect, even though it is common for infected hosts to have high titers of circulating virions. The viral particles detected in the sera of wild Beechey ground squirrels are molecularly and structurally similar, but not identical to HBV. In general, GSHV particles in sera are larger than HBV particles. A filamentous virus particle was the most abundant form in ground squirrel sera much like human sera infected with HBV. The next most abundant particle in sera was spherical with an outer shell or envelope, resembling the Dane particles found in humans. = Tropism = Ground squirrel hepatitis virus infects liver cells and is considered highly hepatotropic. Infection with GSHV can cause persistent infection. The virus causes chronic infection and longer antigenemia (antigen in the blood) when it is injected directly into the liver compared to injection into the portal vein. GSHsAg (viral surface antigen) can be detected in the serum several weeks post infection. = Associated disease = Hepatocellular carcinoma cells Illness or death in GSHV bearing animals due to liver disease has not been shown. In many infected squirrels with high GSHsAg and virion DNA polymerase levels, there are no signs of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. It is possible for ground squirrels persistently infected with GSHV to exhibit signs of mild, nonprogressive hepatitis. No modulation of host processes as a result of GSHV infection is known. Persistent infection with HBV and WHV often results in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The same association has not been observed with GSHV, but it is possible that persistent infection over a time period longer than required of the other two viruses may contribute to the development of HCC. Persistent infection with GSHV for up to three years only results in slight inflammation, so the development of HCC would presumably take longer in most cases.  Transmission  Ground squirrel hepatitis virus can be transmitted both horizontally and vertically. Horizontal transmission can result from inoculation with viremic serum. However, the concentration of serum necessary to transmit infection is much higher than what would be predicted using the assumption that one viral particle is sufficient to initiate infection. One potential explanation for this may be that not every particle detected by physical methods is biologically active, and another explanation is that multiple virions are required to initiate infection. Vertical transmission of GSHV from mother to newborn is also possible but has not been studied extensively.  Distribution  Geographic distribution can be measured by testing the sera of ground squirrels for viral surface antigen, virion DNA polymerase, and virus antibodies at different locations. It is thought that the distribution of GSHV is very localized. It was found in a radius smaller than eight miles in northern California, but it is likely that it exists in undetected places. Additional evidence suggests that the geographic distribution is uneven, which is the case for HBV. There are no indications of factors that may influence geographic distribution of GSHV. No differences in sex distributions of GSHV have been observed. This is unlike HBV in which persistent HBV infections in males outnumbers infections in females.

His title is not known.  Rebellion  Little is known about background of Buluzhen, except that he was a nephew to Yujiul√º Hul√º. He confronted Hul√º who was about to oversee the marriage of one of his own daughters to Feng Ba in 414. Buluzhen told him that his daughter was still small and was about travel far away; as she may get sick with longing, it would be necessary to send the daughters of the nobleman, such as Shuli (Ê®πÈªé) and Wudeyan (ÂãøÂú∞Âª∂) with her. Hul√º not agreeing with him, Buluzhen told Shuli and others that Hul√º was thinking of giving their daughters as a dowry for his daughter to a distant, alien state. In the wake of news Shuli, among other noblemen, entered into a conspiracy with Buluzhen. Some warriors were set up behind the Hul√º's yurts at night and arrested him with his daughter. As result, Yujiul√º Buluzhen was set up as khagan, with Shuli (Ê†ëÈªé) as chancellor.Book of Wei, vol. 103  Reign  After ascending to throne, he sent Yujiul√º Hul√º and his daughter to Northern Yan. Feng Ba treated Hul√º as an honored guest and, as originally planned, took Yujiul√º's daughter as a concubine. Original from the University of California Yujiul√º Hul√º requested that Feng Ba send an army to escort him home and, in May 414, Feng Ba, with some reluctance, gave him an escort commanded by general Wan Ling (Ëê¨Èôµ) who, according to the account, returned after having killed Yujiul√º Hul√º along the way. Back at Rouran, Buluzhen became involved in a love affair with a younger wife of Gaoche leader Chiluohou (Âè±Ê¥õ‰æØ). Chiluohou was an early supporter of Shelun who entrusted him with his son Sheba (Á§æÊãî) . The younger wife revealed to Buluzhen that Chiluohou would support Datan against Buluzhen, as a sign of fidelity, sent him a golden rein. As a response, Buluzhen sent 8,000 cavalry against Chiluohou and burned all his properties while Chiluohou committed suicide. After this, Buluzhen attacked Datan hastily, however Datan came out victorious and strangled both Sheba and Buluzhen, eliminating both rivals and then declared himself khagan.

The Network launched in 2004, and has member cities in seven creative fields. The other fields are: Crafts and Folk Art, Music, Film, Gastronomy, Literature, and Media Arts.  Criteria for UNESCO Design Cities  To be approved as a Design City, cities need to meet a number of criteria set by UNESCO. Designated UNESCO Design Cities share similar characteristics such as having an established design industry; cultural landscape maintained by design and the built environment (architecture, urban planning, public spaces, monuments, transportation); design schools and design research centers; practicing groups of designers with a continuous activity at a local and national level; experience in hosting fairs, events and exhibits dedicated to design; opportunity for local designers and urban planners to take advantage of local materials and urban/natural conditions; design-driven creative industries such as architecture and interiors, fashion and textiles, jewelry and accessories, interaction design, urban design, sustainable design.  About the cities  In 2005, Buenos Aires became the first Design city - with Montreal joining in 2006. Buenos Aires is home to the Metropolitan Design Center (CMD) created in 2001 with the aim of stimulating the productive framework and the quality of life of the citizens of the city, through an effective management of the various areas of design. International Festival of Design is conducted annually in the CMD. In 2014, The Design District was created to consolidate design industry and services of the city in a distinguishing territory and in this manner creating a design-intensive manufacturing cluster. Montreal is known with a considerable number of venues for the presentation of design, along with notable organizations that highlight the creations of designers and architects from Montr√©al and elsewhere. Baku, located on the western shore of the Caspian Sea, has extremely varying architecture, ranging from the Old City (featuring the Palace of the Shirvanshahs, Maiden Tower, etc.), to modern buildings such as Heydar Aliyev Center designed by Zaha Hadid, Carpet Museum and Flame Towers. Baku joined this network on the occasion of World Cities‚Äô Day as Design Cities on October 31, 2019 along with Asahikawa (Japan), Bangkok (Thailand), Cebu City (Philippines), Fortaleza (Brazil), Hanoi (Vietnam), Muharraq (Bahrain), Potsdam (Germany) and San Jos√© (Costa Rica).

From 2002 to 2004, he served as Head of Risk and Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Group's Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) division. In this capacity, he orchestrated the merging of CIB activities between Cr√©dit Lyonnais and those of Cr√©dit Agricole Indosuez, resulting in the 2004 creation of Calyon (now CACIB), of which he became Deputy Chief Executive Officer in charge of Structured Finance, Brokerage, Risk, Support Functions and the International Network. In 2007, Perrier was appointed head of the Asset Management and Institutional Services division at Cr√©dit Agricole. In this capacity, he served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Cr√©dit Agricole Asset Management (CAAM) and Chairman of the Supervisory Board at Caceis. In 2009, he led the merger combining the activities of CAAM and SGAM (Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale Asset Management), giving rise on 1 January 2010, to Amundi, of which he became Chief Executive Officer. At that time, Amundi was 75% owned by Cr√©dit Agricole, with 25% held by Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale.  Since 2010  Yves Perrier has helmed the development of Amundi, with assets under management growing from ‚Ç¨670 billion at the beginning of 2010 to more than ‚Ç¨1.4 trillion in 2017. Growth has largely come from international sources, driven by increasing business with institutional clients and partner banking networks other than those of its shareholders. This expansion reflects a strategy put in place to industrialise internal processes and offer services to a range of different client segments within the framework of both a global and local organisation. The approach has produced efficiency and profitability that are among the highest within the sector: Amundi's cost-to-income ratio, stood at 53.1% in 2016 for an average of 65% for the sector. This overall strategy has also resulted in several workforce reduction plans. In 2015, Yves Perrier supervised the group's initial public offering on the Paris stock market. The IPO was the largest transaction in several years on the Paris stock exchange. In 2017, Amundi acquired Pioneer Investments, in which the integration period was achieved within 18 months. In 2015, Perrier was also appointed Deputy General Manager, Head of the Savings, Insurance and Property division of Cr√©dit Agricole, in charge of the Savings, Insurance and Property division, while continuing his role as CEO of Amundi. = Contributions to the Paris Financial Centre = In June 2010, Yves became Chairman of the Institutional Investors Committee of Paris Europlace. In this capacity, he published a report on savings in 2010 entitled: \\"The Development of Long-Term Savings.\\" He was appointed vice-president of the association on 26 June 2018. On 19 May 2015, Perrier became Chairman of the Association Fran√ßaise de la Gestion Financi√®re (AFG, the French financial managers association), succeeding Paul-Henri de La Porte du Theil. On 30 May 2017, he became an honorary chairman of the association, handing over the chairmanship to Eric Pinon. In 2020, with Jean-Dominique Senard, he is co-chair of a working group created by the Institut Montaigne and the Comit√© M√©dicis, resulting in the publication of a report entitled \\"Responsible capitalism: an opportunity for Europe\\". In it, Perrier and Senard call on Europe to become a continent of \\"responsible capitalism\\", by emphasizing long-term financing and the creation of a common legal framework in reaction to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. = Compensation = Yves Perrier‚Äôs compensation was ‚Ç¨3 million in 2018, comprising ‚Ç¨1 million in fixed compensation and ‚Ç¨2 million in variable compensation. In 2018, the Financial Times published an article focusing on the relative remuneration of CEOs at the world's leading asset management companies noting that Yves Perrier's remuneration is one of the lowest in the industry. In 2020, in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, he gives up half of his ‚Ç¨2 million bonus for 2019 in favor of a Covid-19 solidarity fund set up by Cr√©dit Agricole for the benefit of elderly people.

Henda's Law aims to promote patient doctor discussion as well as reduce the rate of false negatives, as mammography may not detect abnormalities in dense breasts.  HB 2102  The legislation Texas HB 2102 requires that a certified mammography facility approved by the FDA or a certification agency approved by the FDA, shall upon completion of the mammogram provide to the patient educational materials about how dense breast tissue is prevalent and normal, and how it can reduce the efficacy of traditional screening tools such as mammograms. HB 2102 seeks to raise awareness, not standardize care, and is not admissible evidence in a court of law.  History  The law was named after Henda Salmeron, a breast cancer survivor and an activist since 2009, who helped draft Henda‚Äôs Law. She lobbied to change the standard of care for women with dense breast tissue through the Texas House Bill HB 2102, \\"Henda's Law\\", requiring every mammography provider to specifically notify women that they have dense breast tissue and the increased risks associated therewith. Though originally drafted by Texas State Representative, Allen Vaught, the bill was officially authored by Representatives Kenneth Sheets and Anna Hernandez Luna. Governor Rick Perry signed Henda‚Äôs Law, HB 2102, on June 17, 2011. It took effect on Sept 1, 2011. By 2015, 19 states had legal notification statues for dense breast tissue.  Impact & Reception  Between 2011 and 2013, dense breast MRIs increased by 23 times their pre-HB 2102 levels. Alena Allen wrote that the purpose of this legislation would have been better served as a public health initiative rather than targeting the physician and eroding the patient-physician trust, as well as the cost for further supplemental tests. Studies concluded that breast density legislation lead to 1.8 to 3.2 additional patient cancer detection out of 1000 patients, had no consistent effect on radiologist's BD clarifications, that DB legislation had substantial additional economic burden, and that digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) was more cost-effective than ultrasound. One study found that radiologists downgraded their breast density assessments to avoid DB notification for 10 months following the new law, then returned to pre-legislation reporting standards. Women with greater than a high school education in DB legislation states had higher notification rates than in non- DB states, but there was no statistical difference in women with a high school education or less. One study found that BD notification letters may be too difficult for the general public to read (exceeded 8th grade reading level), and that public websites performed better.

He has been the Old Believer bishop of Chi»ôinƒÉu and Moldova since 2005. Personal life Mikheyev was born on 17 May 1942 in Kandalaksha, Murmansk region, in a family of Old Believers. His family has a history of clergymen, most prominent being his Peter Semenovich Mikheev, was dean of the Moscow region. In his early childhood was shaped by the fighting and aftermath of World War II, where many of his family members perished.–ö–∞–ª–µ–Ω–¥–∞—Ä—å –†–ü–°–¶. 2013. —Å—Ç—Ä. 191. [Calendar of the RORC, 2013, p. 191.] In 1954 at the age of 12 he moved to the village of Shuvoye in the Yegoryevsky District of the Moscow Oblast, where his grandmother Varvara Mikhailovna lived. By his own admission: \\"After the war, in Shuvoy, my peers and I went to the temple. And we did not feel any particular persecution at that time. Perhaps the reason was that the chairman of the village council was an Old Believer at that time, and that all the inhabitants of the village were Old Believers or came from [Old Believers] families. And all supported each other. And the secretary of the village council generally helped my grandfather in his affairs, helped with certificates when he needed to go somewhere to make a request.\\" At the end of high school in 1959 Mikheyev entered the Yegoryevsk professional school where he studied the profession of carpenter. He afterwards worked for several years at the factory in Shuvoy. Around this time he also visited Old-rite churches in Shuvoy and Yegoryevsk. Religious life In 1967 he began working as psalmist for the Old Believer Church of the Nativity of the Most Holy Theotokos in Orekhovo-Zuev. In December 1967 he was ordained a lector in the church. In 1968, Mikheyev married a woman named Evgenia Mikhailovna Kulikova, and later in that same year he was ordained a priest by Archbishop . For the next 38 years, he served pastor of a parish in Vereya. He also served at the Old-rite Moscow Cathedral in Rogozhsky, Moscow Oblast; he was originally only invited to serve there on a temporary basis by then bishop but ended up coming to the parish for over 33 years. In 1999, his wife died. On 20 October 2004, at the Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Old-Rite Church, he was elected as candidate for the episcopacy, and on 21 October he was approved as a candidate for the vacant episcopal see of the diocese of Chi»ôinƒÉu. On 17 November 2004, in the in Moscow, Bishop of Kiev and All Ukraine performed a monastic tonsure upon Mikheyev and bestowed Mikheyev with the name Eumenius. On 2 January 2005, he was ordained bishop. On Saturday 5 February 2005, he arrived at the diocese of Chi»ôinƒÉu. Views Mikheyev opposes the reconciliation with the Russian Orthodox Church, what he and other old believers calls the \\"new-rite Church.\\" In 1971, the Local Council of the Russian Orthodox Church took place and recognized the old and new rites as equal. However, Mikheev said that Old Believers were not affected by the council and did not trust the new developments as the two churches are not in communion with one another. Mikheev says that reconciliation will only be possible between the two churches if the \\"new-rite Church\\" readopts the pre-Nikon traditions. Regarding the increasing ties between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Russian government, Mikheev views this as a positive change and says that he hopes that more Orthodoxy being introduced in the government and schools will ultimately bring more individuals back to the Old Believer faith. Mikheev says that although he appreciates Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's writings that were often sympathetic to the Old Believer traditions, he says that Old Believers cannot fully accept Solzhenitsyn as he himself was not religiously an Old Believer. Mikheev says that he has greater appreciation for Dmitry Likhachov as the latter came from a family that had Old Believer roots. He claims that Likhachev even visited Mikheev's church in Rogozhsky where Likhachev was given a tour, an honor that would not usually be given to individuals from outside the community.

Born and raised in Philadelphia's Port Richmond neighborhood, he was given the nickname \\"Happy\\" at a young age, in tribute to his smiling disposition. McNulty attended parochial school at Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Catholic Church, but dropped out at age 14 to find work. He worked in the local chemical industry, eventually rising to become foreman of the plastics division of Allied Chemical Company. He also became involved in local politics, and was elected a Republican committeeman in 1931; two years later, he was named ward leader of the 25th ward, a position he would hold for forty years. In 1934, he married Ida Lafferty, with whom he would have four children. In 1963, McNulty was the Republican nominee for city council from the sixth district. In what the Philadelphia Daily News called \\"one of the biggest surprises\\" of the election that November, he narrowly defeated the incumbent, Democrat William A. Dwyer Jr. On the Council, he earned a reputation as a quiet but well-liked legislator. Nevertheless, when the time came for reelection, party leaders looked for a different candidate to take McNulty's place. When the party hierarchy endorsed former city controller Frank J. Tiemann for the sixth district seat, McNulty entered the primary anyway. Tiemann won the primary. In the general election, Tiemann lost to Democrat Joseph L. Zazyczny. After leaving office, McNulty worked for the state Department of Revenue as an auditor. He retired in 1970 and moved to Cherry Hill, New Jersey.

The first known appearance of this name was in a publication by the ancient geographer Pausanias (110-180 AD). He called it untilled plain, because the grassland and acres may be flooded beyond the time when annual vegetation starts. When the winter rains were very heavy, floods can even turn the plain into a temporary lake. Intensive karst formation (drainage in underground waterways of limestone layers) prevents the formation of a permanent lake. In rare cases, even today, modern technologies can not prevent flooding. The Polje Argon Pedion Peloponnese Temporary lake in Argon Pedion, A7 motorway. Ditch to ponor (10 tree tops in water, front left) Totally green in springtime  Geography  = Environment = The prefecture Arcadia (ŒùŒøŒºœåœÇ ŒëœÅŒ∫Œ±Œ¥ŒØŒ±œÇ) is almost entirely rural and mountainous (Arcadian Plateau). The villages are scattered all over the land; there are only very few cities, even the largest city Tripoli, Greece, with ca. 30000 inhabitants (without district and hinterland) is relatively small. Steep mountains and forests are scarcely populated. Extensive forests dominate in the central north (Mainalo) and the central- south, following the prefectures southern border which marks the mountain chain of the Parnon, way down to the coast of the Argolic Gulf. Valleys divide the mountain chains, but they are important draining paths only from November to April, while many brooks even dry up totally. The size of the valleys indicate, there were larger water quantities in earlier time periods. On steeply inclined slopes the topsoil is often drastically eroded, only degenerated shrubland prevails. Alluvial sediment deposits are scarce. Accumulated soil structures are found only in plains, basins or flat coastal sections. The climate of the Peloponnese is similar in all parts, the temperature varies only in relation to the height. The influence of the Mediterranean Sea is omnipresent, as no point of the land is at a larger distance than 50 miles. The climate is best classified as mediterranean with dry hot summers and mild wet winters. As the dry season may last for months, the thin rests of soil on mountain slopes are merely covered by Maquis shrubland, often of a degraded character. Even then, forests, when healthy and dense, are only mildly more humid and cooler. Very dominant is the intensive karstification, which is present throughout. This dries out the humidity of soil; the often closed character of karst depressions may cause floods, as subterranean drainage can be too slow. But during the relatively short springtime, the rain of the last winter and mild temperatures may result in a very beautiful, blossoming season, where biodiversity of Arcadian landscapes will show (April, May). As intensive dry summer periods may cause severe lack of freshwater, retaining it in reservoirs would be an important contribution to public health by supplying sufficient water at all times. At the same time publicly supplied water for irrigation and, eventually, for electricity from power stations, could help to develop the country. The land, which is suitable for herding or agriculture, is locally cultivated in traditional forms only. There is no industrial production in Arcadia. There was migration in all of Greece, in the Peloponnese and also in Arcadia's Argon Pedion, mainly after 1945 to North America and Australia. The infrastructure of transportation is miserable. While one heavily frequented highway connects Athens with Patras along the Corinthian Gulf, there is only one other modern highway (motorway), connecting Corinth with Tripoli and the south (at Megalopoli with two divisions, towards Messenia and Laconia). The partly tolled motorways are the only constructions, where the very mountainous, difficult topography of the Peloponnese does not dictate the route. The only railway line serving Arcadia and the south (Corinthia-Tripoli-Kalamata), a narrow-gauge railway, was partly refitted and then ‚Äì before the new operation ‚Äì liquidated, including goods traffic in 2011. = The polje Argon Pedion = The closed basin Argon Pedion (4 x 2 km, a polje similar to poljes in the karstic Dinaric Alps) is a stand- alone part of the Tripoli Basin (30 x 6 km) in the northeast. In a publication the Greek geologist I. Mariolakos describes the Tripoli Basin, the basin of Argon Pedion and other similar neighboring basins of Arcadia and compares them with the classical myths, which are broadly present among Greeks.Mariolakos, Ilias. Geomythological Sites and Prehistoric geotechnical and hydraulic Works in Arcadia... See Literature and see External Links. Two mountains, opposite to each other form a 250 m wide flat bottom at the south end of Argon Pedion. But as this bottom gap between the mountains is higher than the basin's bottom, it functions like a dam. Consequently, only floods with a water level of more than 5 m can be drained aboveground. This turns the plain into a closed basin. The rain down the mountains fills the draining ditches, then floods the untilled plain (grassland), making the soil sucked with water. Exceptionally large rain waters may swell up to a temporary lake, whose upper border may not or may reach the acres in the slightly higher upper basin section, that is cultivated by the village Saga. The subsurface drainage through the katavothra may be so slow that it will extend into the vegetation time (April). The grassland is ideal for herding sheep and goats, as a ground sucked with water makes wanton grass vegetation, that dries up later in the dry period. With ‚Äúcows of the poor‚Äù many people of the two villages at the borders of the basin make their living. When the grassland is dried up, the goats, which are well known for their abilities to undemanding feed and easy digesting, weatherproof in hot and cold and climbing well even on bare rock may move to the mountain slopes around, where they can feed on sparse vegetation of shrubs. Yet this bares the danger of overgrazing, as plants are kept down by these animal's preferred feeding of all kinds of buds.

However, around the village, on alluvial grounds and on slope terraces, where the soil is as rich as in the plain, the villagers successfully established gardens and niche-plantation.See ‚Äúthriving walnut plantation‚Äù in External Links  Geology, Hydrogeology  = Geology of Greece = The peninsula Peloponnese is dominated by carbonate rock, ‚ÄúTripoliza‚Äù (limestone- and similar carbonate formations). These rock formations were subject of intense tectonicsJaboshagen, V. (ed), Geologie von Griechenland‚Ä¶German and English. See Literature that shattered the carbonate formations over time. Water, which runs through the tectonically induced fractures chemically soluted the rock (karstifikation) and thus widened the fractions over time (dissolution) to the size of subterranean waterways, even caves. Physical and chemical weathering and all kinds of water erosion washed the surfaces off the mountains,once vegetation is poor on slopes, capacity to hold or create new soil is weak over time, accumulating layers of loose sediment on the rocky floors of the basins. This is so in most parts of the Peninsula. = Geology and Hydrology of Argon Pedion = In vast parts of the Arcadian Highland such geological and hydrogeological conditions prevail. Important tectonic fractures formed between the Arcadian highland and the Argolic Gulf. As upper karstic forms developed the fractured structure, these became the most important hydrotectonic units. The existence of such structures have been backed up by a large geological study, which had the Arcadian basins as subject.Morfis et al, pp. 24-33, see Literature The distribution of the subsurface karst waters and the retention time in the karstic underground, until the water emerged again in large springs at the Argolic Gulf, was quantified and verified by a lot of experimental dye tracings in 1983 and again in 1984. These experiments evaluated many subterranean waterways between several katavothres and springs at the Argolic Gulf. The drainage between Argon Pedion and the spring Kiveri (Argolic Gulf) was confirmed as one of the large underground discharges.Morfis et al, pp. 276-292, see Literature Although the karst water of spring Kiveri emerges in the sea-water of the continental shelf it is sweet water of surprisingly good quality: The Chlorides have an extraordinarily low value and thus the water is suitable for irrigation.P. Fleury et al: Submarine springs and coastal karst aquifers. See Literature Since the emerged water quantity is large,The tectonic faults transport karst water from basins in Corinthia and Arcadia. See also the graphic of :Image:Orohydrography_NE-Peloponnese_detail.jpg a 5-meter broad concrete canal was built to transport the irrigation water over 15 km to the extensive fertile low plain of Argos, where thousands of farmers cultivate the plain. It is interesting, that de reemerging of the karst water of Argon Pedion in the large submarine spring Kiveri was already known by the ancient author Pausanias.See the section ‚ÄúHistory of Arcadia and Argon Pedion‚Äù, further down In rainy winters there may be more water than the only one katavothra, which opens in the limestone rock wall below the village Nestani, can drain rapidly enough. A temporary lake will be created. It happens, that the mass of water will not all be drained by the beginning of springtime.Ford‚Ä¶ Karst Hydrogeology and Geomorphology‚Ä¶, p. 361ff, see Literature This phenomenon of a temporary lake in Argon Pedion is documented for the years 2003, 2014 and again March 2019.See the photo above at the top of the article :Image:Karst-lake_Argon-Pedion_Arcadia_Peloponnese.jpg The not obstructed subterranean water transport from the katavothra to the springs at the Argolic Gulf takes ca. 190 hours.Geomythological sites, Mariolakos, p. 16.

Cultivating the ground and properly treating the available water resources reflected the local opportunities. On alluvial soils of slopes around the villages, which have favorable grounds as in the plain, the people cultivated gardens and terraces. The care necessary for cultivating and watering the plain in the dry summer period was achieved by walled irrigation wells with chunky shovels. There were wells distributed across the whole plain. The metal is now rusty, the wells are rugged constructions, but no longer in use. Where necessary and affordable these tools are replaced by motorized pumps. Apart from single initiatives, the mechanization of agriculture, measured by the international industry standard, is still rather modest. Drainage ditches are everywhere in the plain and obviously important to prevent it from becoming swampy, but taking care of holding the water table and the proper humidity for grassland and acres as long as possible is another thing. All drainage is towards the one single kathavotha. That is why excessive precipitation in case of intensive winter rainfall often exceeded the capacity of ditches to swiftly transport the water and the Katavothra to swallow it. Advanced knowledge, machinery, and methods beyond smallholding agriculture were implemented: New ditches were dredged, all ditches well cleaned, a row of trees planted to strengthen the ground. The 5 meter opening of the katavothra in the massive limestone rock was sheathed by a strong metal lattice.  History of Argon Pedion and Arcadia  = The ancient geographer = The publication of Pausanias (120-180 AD), handed down in Hellenistic Greek (ŒïŒªŒªŒ¨Œ¥ŒøœÇ œÄŒµœÅŒπŒÆŒ≥Œ∑œÉŒπœÇ), also available in German (Beschreibung Griechenlands) and English translation (Description of Greece), describes in Book 8, Arcadia, and explicitly also Argon Pedion.Description of Greece, Book 8, see Literature and External Links Actually, the name ‚ÄúArgon Pedion‚Äù, the modern Greek term for ‚Äúuntilled plain‚Äù, is the term Pausanias introduced in his publication. Pausanias describes the ancient road, which starts at the ancient city of Argos, ascending the mountain chain Artemisio to the ‚ÄúPortitsa-Pass‚Äù and then, abruptly downhill, the zigzag descent into the basin of Argon Pedion. The zigzag path is still there and visible (see the photo ‚ÄúLadder‚Äù). Pausanias describes the ‚ÄúLadder‚Äù (ŒöŒªŒπŒºŒ±Œæ Œ†Œ±œÖœÉŒ±ŒΩŒØŒ±) with detail about its steps.: > [4] There is a pass into Arcadia [‚Ä¶]. There are two others on the side of > Mantineia: one through what is called Primus and one through the Ladder. The > latter is the broader, and its descent had steps that were once cut into > it.[‚Ä¶]. Pausanias, Book 8, Arcadia, 8.6.4, English by W.H.S. Jones/H.A. > Ormerod, London 1918 > After crossing into Mantinean country over Mount Artemisius you will come to > a plain called the Untilled Plain, whose name well describes it, for the > rain-water coming down into it from the mountains prevents the plain from > being tilled; nothing indeed could prevent it from being a lake, were it not > that the water disappears into a chasm in the earth. [2] After disappearing > here it rises again at Dine (Whirlpool). Dine is a stream of fresh-water > rising out of the sea by what is called Genethlium in Argolis. Pausanias, > Book 8, Arcadia, 8.7.1f, English by W.H.S. Jones/H.A. Ormerod, London 1918 Dine is obviously Kiveri Spring. Pausanias‚Äô time obviously had a basic knowledge of the hydrology of the untilled plain and the re-emergence of the water in the submarine spring Kiveri in the continental shelf of the Argolic Gulf. The ancient Portitsa-Pass is an impressive human-made monument: A 6 m deep incision in the rock at the mountain crest, with 3 m, broad enough to give way to a wagon, of which rests of wheel tracks were discoveredSee Klimax road‚Ä¶ in External Links The descent on Pausanias‚Äô Ladder in ancient times was a zigzag wagon driveway, of which the historical upper section still exists. The descent is the old driveway across the basin Argon Pedion.See ‚ÄúPorta Artemissiou‚Äù in External Links = The Renaissance of Arcadian idyll = A remarkable interpretation of Theocritus‚Äô ‚Äúidyll‚Äù was given by the Roman poet and epics writer Virgil. He took the idealized Sicilian rustics and set them in Arcadia. For him, Arcadia was the homeland, where idyll had its origin. The idea was ‚Äúreborn‚Äù in the Italian ‚ÄúRenaissance‚Äù, supported by the enthusiastic patron Lorenzo de' Medici. Arcadia, the ‚ÄúCountry of the Shepherds‚Äù inspired Italian poetry (Poesia bucolic) and became a very important literary genre. The leading painter Nicolas Poussin, French, but living in Rome, had a lasting impression not only on the baroque epoch of art. His two versions of the painting ‚ÄúEt in arcadia ego‚Äù (e.g. ‚ÄúEven in Arcadia, there am I‚Äù) symbolize pure, rural, idyllic life, peace, and death. Ever since then and to the present prevails this kind of blissful idea of self-complacent shepherd life in Arcadia, the Greek country, that is not a classical Greek city-state, an ‚Äúidyll‚Äù that is alive ‚Äì especially among many ‚Äúclassically educated‚Äù.

She had held numerous governance positions and was elected to the 1st National People's Congress in 1954, and had been re-elected for all the subsequent sittings of the National People's Congress over the next 65 years, the only person to have done so. This has led to some commentators calling her the world's longest serving congresswoman.  Biography  Shen was born in Pingshun County, Shanxi on 29 December 1929. Her father Song Jinshui () died early. In 1934 her mother Wu Quanxiang () remarried to Shen Hengtai (), a doctor in Pingshun County. Shen Jilan grew up in Pingshun County. In 1943 she responded to a call by Mao Zedong and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to establish party organisation in Xigou village alongside Li Shunda. Together with other farming families she established a local agricultural labour mutual aid group and defence force and came to prominence within the party through the 1950s based on the success of this local cooperative. Shen Jilan in 1953 In 1952 she was encouraged by higher powers in the Communist party to widen the cooperative to cover 26 individual farms - the first production cooperative to be established in the People's Republic of China. On the establishment of this wider cooperative Jilan was elected deputy president. She established a working women's group to carry out agricultural work. In 1954, she proposed the addition of the equal pay for equal work clause in the first constitution of China to reduce gender pay gap, and her proposal was adopted. She commented in a 2018 interview: \\"Men got 10 work points a day, but we only got a maximum of five points no matter how much work we did.\\" To highlight the unfairness in this approach she organised a manuring contest between the male and female workers - with the female workers winning the contest. Four female representatives from Shanxi attended the first National People's Congress in 1954 (Shen far right) In 1953 Shen joined the Communist Party of China and gained widespread media attention due to the success of the farming cooperative. She was elected to the 1st National People's Congress in 1954 - one of four female representatives from Shanxi province. Of the 1,226 deputies to attend the first congress only 147 were women. She was the only person to have been elected to every session of the National People's Congress having been returned to the 13th National People's Congress in 2018. In 1973 she became director of the Shanxi Women's Federation, a position she held for ten years, before returning to her home village of Xigou in 1983. During this period China was establishing a market economy and Jilan established herself as an entrepreneur in the local economy. She helped establish a ferroalloy plant, walnut oil factory and cannery in the local area. She was also an integral part of a reforestation plan in Xigou. In 2008, she was chosen as an Olympic torch carrier as part of the buildup to the 2008 Summer Olympics. It was reported by local media that she donated 10,000 Chinese yuan to the 2008 Sichuan earthquake relief. In 2013 her calls for widespread internet regulation were met with controversy by younger people in China. In 2019 she was awarded the highest order of honour in China, the Medal of the Republic. She died on 28 June 2020 at the age of 90, from stomach cancer. Personal life Shen was married to Zhang Hailiang (), a veteran of the Korean War and later became director of Changzhi Municipal Urban Construction Bureau. The couple had one son and two daughters, in order of birth: Zhang Lizhen (; director in a military hospital in Handan), Zhang Jiangping (; Party chief of Changzhi Municipal Food Bureau), and Zhang Jiang'e (; staff member of Changzhi Municipal Engineering Division).

In her final years, Lawrence worked closely with attorney Peter O'Connor to start the non-profit organisation Fair Share Housing Development Inc., which built over 200 units for moderate- to low-income tenants in Mount Laurel. Early life Lawrence was the second of eight children born to Mary and Leslie Robinson.Courtney, Marian. ‚ÄúFor Chief Plaintiff, A 15-Year Battle.‚Äù The New York Times, 4 Aug. 1985. Lawrence's ancestors had resided in Mount Laurel since the nineteenth-century when her slave ancestors had used the Underground Railroad stations organized by the Quakers who had made the Mount Laurel area a sanctuary to runaways during the Civil War.Kent, Bill. ‚ÄúComing Home.‚Äù New Jersey Monthly, Feb. 2000, pp. 23‚Äì27. Growing up, Lawrence attended the segregated school on Moorestown-Mount Laurel Road. Lawrence's mother, Mary, was a religious and civic-minded woman who instilled similar values in all her children. At her mother's urging, sixteen year old Lawrence, with other African-American youth, demanded to be seated in the \\"whites only\\" section of a local movie theater.  Adult life  Lawrence met and married Thomas Lawrence (who died in 1979), and together they reared nine children: four boys and five girls. In 1955, Ethel and Thomas purchased their own home in Mount Laurel. Struggling to maintain their home and support their children, Lawrence decided to enroll in college at Bank Street University in New York and received a degree in early childhood education. She went on to be employed as a pre-school teacher for Daycare 100. Lawrence's civil rights work placed a significant and often dangerous burden on her family, specifically her children. One of her daughters, Ethel Lawrence-Halley, remembers: \\"At first, some of the kids we used to play with told us they wouldn't play with us anymore. My sister and I had dogs set on us while we were walking. Then came the words and the threats. I'd never been called the N-word in my life until then. People called my mother a troublemaking bitch. We had to change our phone number so many times I lost count. The worst it got was when somebody shot out my mother's bedroom window.\\" Liebling, Charles. ‚ÄúRace and Affordable Housing: The Saga of Mount Laurel Reads like a Civil Rights Docudrama.‚Äù Sunday Press, 10 Mar. 1998. However, Lawrence persisted in her civic work because she believed that her family, and her neighbors' families, had the same rights to affordable housing as the new wealthy, suburban residents. =Mount Laurel I= Lawrence was an officer, pianist, and director of the Young People's Dept. (YPD) of Jacob's Chapel, A.M.E. (African Methodist Episcopal) Church in Mt. Laurel. Around 1960, Mt. Laurel officials were condemning and tearing down the substandard homes of many \\"lower income\\" people; however, no efforts were made to assist them in relocating elsewhere within the Mount Laurel community. As a result, Lawrence, along with Reverent Stuart Wood and other church members, formed a non-profit corporation, called The Springville Community Action Committee, to develop low- and moderate-income housing. In 1969, the Township Zoning board denied the 36-unit housing project proposed by the Action Committee, with Bill Haines, the Mayor at the time, famously saying, \\" If you people can't afford to live in our town, then you'll just have to leave.\\"Kirp, David L. ‚ÄúHere Comes the Neighborhood.‚Äù The New York Times, 13 Oct. 2013. Outraged, the Committee sued. At Camden Regional Legal Services, three young lawyers‚ÄîPeter O'Connor, Carl Bisgaier, and Ken Meiser‚Äîtook on their case, with Lawrence agreeing to be the lead plaintiff. The lawsuit accused the township of using its zoning laws to discriminate against poor residents. In 1975, the Supreme Court of New Jersey ruled in favor of Lawrence, in a ruling called Mount Laurel I. Mount Laurel I holds that all New Jersey municipalities have a State Constitutional obligation to provide their fair share of the region's need for low-income and moderate-income housing.DePalma, Anthony. ‚ÄúMount Laurel: Slow, Painful Progress .‚Äù The New York Times, 1 May 1988. However, in 1976, in response to the ruling, Mount Laurel Township changed its zoning law, allowing the low-income housing project to be built, but on unstable, swampy land. As a result, Lawrence and her neighbors returned to court.Smothers, Ronald. ‚ÄúMt. Laurel Votes to Build Homes for Poor: A 26-Year Legal Battle Ends in Affluent Suburb.‚Äù The New York Times, 12 Apr. 1997. =Mount Laurel II= In 1983, the Supreme Court of New Jersey again ruled in favor of Lawrence and the other plaintiffs, in a ruling known as Mount Laurel II. In the second ruling, the courts specified how many units of affordable housing should be built in township, and instructed lower court judges to set similar goals for other towns. This decision only increased controversy among suburban communities, with many fair share numbers doubling the housing stocks and increasing worry among wealthy residents who feared that their communities would be invaded by hoards of \\"poor people\\" bringing crime, higher taxes, and lower property values =Fair Housing Act & the Council on Affordable Housing= As a result of many disputes, and under pressure from towns that objected to the Mount Laurel rulings, the New Jersey Legislature passed the Fair Housing Act of 1985. The Act created a Council on Affordable Housing and an administrative process for setting local housing goals. This compromising piece of legislation was met with annoyance by both sides. From the beginning, the Council recalled the state's affordable housing need, reducing it from the 277,808 reached by the court to 145,707. The Council also allowed municipalities to lower their quotas even further by crediting them for subsidized apartments built since 1980 and for environmentally sensitive land considered unbuildable. They also could count renovated houses and accessory apartments tucked in basements and garages towards their totals. The most notorious act set by the Council allowed municipalities to reduce their housing obligations by up to one-half by making a one-time payment to another municipality (usually poor and urban) that agrees to accept their housing obligation. =Mount Laurel III= Despite Mount Laurel I, II, the Fair Housing Act, and the Council on Affordable Housing, the law and its provisions continued to be challenged in court, with talk in the legislature of denying Chief Justice Wilentz's (the Judge responsible for the ruling of Mount Laurel II) permanent nomination to the Supreme Court of the United States. In February 1986, the State Supreme Court issued another decision, now referred to as Mount Laurel III, which unanimously upheld the law as constitutional and consistent with Mount Laurel I and II. =Fair Share Housing Development, Inc.= In 1986 attorney Peter O'Connor founded a non-profit organization called Fair Share Housing Development Inc.Smothers, Ronald. ‚ÄúDecades Later, Town Considers Housing Plan For the Poor.‚Äù The New York Times, 3 Mar. 1997. Lawrence was named the charter president of the board of trustees of the company. According to their website: \\"The mission of Fair Share Housing Development (FSHD) is to promote economically and racially diverse communities throughout the tri-county region surrounding the City of Camden, New Jersey through the development of affordable housing with supportive services in an effort to improve the lives of moderate-income, low-income and very low-income families, the elderly and disabled and to reverse decades of decline and segregation in the City of Camden by providing Camden City residents with the choice to reside in affordable housing in high-opportunity communities with access to decent jobs, good schools, and a safe environment.\\" In May 1994, Lawrence's daughter Ethel Lawrence-Halley was named administrator of the Mount Laurel project. However, Lawrence would not live to see the township grant final approval for the construction of 100 subsidized townhouses to Fair Share Housing, the first phase of Ethel R. Lawrence Homes (ERLH). It wasn't until 1997 that the Mount Laurel Planning Board finally approved the nonprofit's request to build. Following the first phase, two other phases were built in 2003 (ERLH II - 40 units) and 2018 (ERLH III - 36 units). A nearby development in Mount Laurel called Robinson Estates (named after Ethel‚Äôs mother Mary) features 24 single- family homes, a rarity in affordable housing, and was also built in 2018, as part of the redevelopment project that led to the construction of ERLH III.

Al-Sudani infiltrated ISIS, becoming a trustee and car-bombs driver, allowing the Iraqi military to neutralize around 30https://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm car-bomb attacks. Al-Sudani have been described as \\"[Iraq]‚Äôs most successful spy\\" while operating within the secret intelligence unit called Al Suquor, or the Falcons Intelligence Cell, the counter-terrorism unit leading operations against ISIS. The Falcons have been praised by US services for infiltrating IS cells, killing or arresting leaders, preventing attacks and destroying weapons.  Early life  Al-Sudani has grown up in Ramadi then Baghdad, within a strict disciplinarian family, working after school to his father small print shop. In university, he neglected his studies. Under pressure from family, he settled into an arranged marriage, returned to school to learn English and Russian, but eventually took a surveillance job for Iraq's oil infrastructures. The job didn't inspire Harith. Both Munaf al-Sudani and then Harith al-Sudani were recruited by the Falcons Intelligence Cell. Harith was hired in 2013, leveraging his computer and languages skills and assigned to monitor web traffic and telephone calls of terrorist suspects.  Falcons recruit  In 2014, with the emergence and sudden rise of ISIS, the Falcons were commissioned to infiltrate the group with undercover agents. Harith volunteered, motivated against ISIS crimes and children killed in ISIS attacks. Harith al-Sudani was promoted Captain and started training to pose as a jihadist. His childhood and family origins from Ramadi, a Sunni regions at the core of ISIS' miscontenment and raise, allowed al-Sudani to adopt the Ramadi accent and pretend to be an disempowered Sunni. A Shia muslim, he trained himself into Sunni rituals, prayers, and favored Koran verses. He soon posed as Abu Suhaib, an unemployed sunni muslim from Baghdad. His assigned mission was to infiltrate ISIS lair in Tarmiya, a town known to be a major source of suicide bombers to the capital. As Abu Suhaib, he was quickly recruited by local ISIS members within a monitored Tarmiya's mosque.  Infiltrated ISIS operative  ISIS leadership quickly valued his perceived quality of native from Baghdad, which would increase chances to pass through omniscient check points. First trained on explosives and religions, \\"Abu Suhaib\\" was put in charge of practical bombing operations, receiving Mosul's orders, selected suicide bombers sent from there, and picking up the explosive-loaded vehicles in preparation of ISIS attacks. Al-Sudani's counter terrorism operation typically involved key aspects. Undercover, al-Sudani would informing his Falcon team of his mission, driving bomb-cars to Baghdad. A Falcons' chase car would follow, equipped with jamming devices to prevent remote phone activation of the bomb. At a check-point or agreed stop, he would let the Falcons demining team to dismantle the bomb and replacing it with relevant pyrotechnic devices, or luring and neutralizing the suicide bomber he was transporting. Then, dropping the car at the target point, other Falcons agents would take place and act as victims of a light, controlled explosion. Photos and fake security briefs would be sent to news organisations to pretend a successful attack occurred. Captain al-Sudani would then be picked up by ISIS agents and get back to his infiltration mission. In mid-2016, following various military and intelligence defeats, ISIS increased his terror campaign. Al-Sudani was asked to scoot for new places to target. He used his longer presence in Baghdad to pay a visit to his family, receiving a worrying phonecall from ISIS operatives pointing out his GPS positions was not as he claimed.  Last mission  Due to al-Sudani's GPS driving patterns likely monitored by ISIS and on-site damages not matching the explosives amount put into suicide-cars, ISIS grew suspicious of him. Mosul's leadership missioned him a car bomb for December 31, 2016, as part of a wider and coordinated multi-city bombing. Unknown to him, ISIS bugged their white Kia pickup with a microphone and GPS. When al-Sudani drove to his destination together with his explosive payload and started phone communication with the Falcons security team, ISIS secretly overhead the conversation, confirming al-Sudani inflitration within their ranks. When al-Sudani drove off toward the agreed meeting point with the demining team, he received a call from ISIS operative, pointing out his claimed position and GPS weren't matching, which he explained by a driving error. At a closer point, eight agents swiftly dismantled the vehicle's bomb made of a detonator, 26 bags of C4 explosive, ammonium nitrate, and ball bearings. Replaced with the relevant fake bomb, the car headed to its target, outside of Al Bayda Cinema in Baghdad al Jadeeda, and exploded as expected. Around midnight, news outlet reported an explosion with no casualties.  Death  On January 17, 2017, Al-Sudani was called back into an unusual location in the countryside of Tarmiya. Contact with Captain al-Sudani was lost soon after his arrival. A rescue operation was mounted in 3 days, the time needed to plan an action into ISIS stronghold, but failed to find Captain al-Sudani while one special forces soldier was killed. Some intelligences suggested he was prisonner in Qaim, another ISIS stronghold, or taken to Syria. In August 2017, a video of his beheading was published. Three other men were also beheaded. The ISIS cell responsible for Al-Sudani's killing was bombed in Syria in December 2018. Capt. al-Sudani was captured in January 2017, after 16 months undercover, and died in August 2017 according to Iraqi intelligence. Recognition  The family of Captain al-Sudani only learnt of his critical anti-terrorism role after his death. As of August 2018, the al- Sudani family has been trying for a year to get recognition for Harith's role and claim the relevant pensions for his widow and three children. As al-Sudani was killed in ISIS territories, no body is available as proof to administratively confirm the serviceman's death in action. Both his Falcons Intelligence Cell and Iraqi's Joint Military Command announced his death in counter-terrorism operation. The initial August 12, 2018, New York Times coverage ignited numerous media coverage and popular reaction over al-Sudani action and heroism. On Monday 13th, according to Harith's father, an assistant of Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi contacted the al-Sudani family in order to facilitate the family's requests. The official called the appropriate administrative court judges in order to issue a formal death certificate, while another official admitted this situation to be unfortunately typical. The family thanked the officials for mediating in their favor.

The ride is situated in the Berlin area of the park.  Story  It is Berlin in the 1920's. The kitchens of master p√¢tissier Gustav E. Lehmann are infested with mice. In order to get rid of them he calls Oskar Koslowski, a pest controller who uses rather unconventional methods to avoid the use of toxic substances that could ruin Lehmann's cakes. Koslowski arms himself with pastry bags to fight the rodents with shots of cream and chocolate. There are too many mice for Koslowski to handle on his own so guests are called in as reinforcements to get rid of the mice.  Design and Operation  Loading station of the ride Maus au Chocolat was inspired by Toy Story Midway Mania and was designed for Phantasialand by Eric Daman in collaboration with ETF Ride Systems, 3DBA and Alterface. The ride immerses guests behind the scenes of a large p√¢tisserie infested with mice. The ride was part of the reorganisation of the central area of the park and was built in a new building bordering Wuze Town. The entrance of the ride is through the storerooms of the p√¢tisserie. As guests make their way through the queue-line they find that all the food has been locked away and discover the presence of the p√¢tisserie's little intruders. On the loading platform, a pair of 3D glasses is given to each guest before boarding their vehicle. The vehicles leave in groups of three and each can contain four guests (two on each side). Each guest has a pastry bag in front of them to shoot virtual chocolate at the mice that appear on seven screens throughout the ride, with the ride vehicles briefly stopping at each. Guests gain points for each mouse they hit. In the last scene the scores and winner for each ride are announced. The exit is through a tea room that opened the same year as the ride. The name of the ride is a play on words between Maus (German for mouse) and Mousse au chocolat.

Better known by the ring name The Great Togo, he was one of the first wrestling heels of Japanese descent in America after World War II. Career Okamura was born to Japanese parents in United States, though there was the theory that he was actually Korean or Chinese in origin. He studied philosophy at Oregon University before starting his wrestling career. He debuted in professional wrestling in 1949. Like many other wrestlers of Japanese descent at the time, he adopted a foreign heel gimmick and an oriental-sounding ring name, in this case \\"The Great Togo.\\" He hailed himself as a martial artist with karate skills, prayed in a small Buddhist altar before his matches, and was assisted by a fellow Japanese valet named Hata who burned incense. He became one of the most hated villains of the ring, as well as one of the most feared wrestlers. Despite his technical skill, his matches often ended in disqualifications in order for his opponents to save face. During the 1950s, he started a long and heated feud with Argentine Rocca. He later introduced his kayfabe brother Tosh Togo, who became his usual tag team partner. Their team would expand with more Japanese family members, Mas Togo (Kyokushin karate founder Mas Oyama) and Ko Endo (judoka Kokichi Endo). From the 50s to the 60s he played as Rikidozan's manager in the Pacific Coast area. After his retirement, he moved along with his wife to Los Angeles, where he died in 1973 due to a gastric carcinoma.

Together, they gave financial support for cultural and literary projects. Their father, ƒêorƒëe Simiƒá, was a captain of the Rasina under Karaƒëorƒëe during the First Serbian Uprising. As representative of the newly liberated Serbia at Constantinople, Simiƒá transcribed all of the Sultan's edicts (Hati≈°erif) relating to Serbia in three languages: Serbian, French, and Turkish.

Simiƒá also had a palace built in the center of Belgrade, which housed the Serbian court from 1842 to 1903, when King Alexander and Queen Draga were assassinated. In 1903, the building was demolished. A new royal palace was built on the same site. The portrait of Simiƒá by Uro≈° Kne≈æeviƒá is currently in the National Museum of Belgrade.

Aleksa Simiƒá also participated in the founding of the Gligorije Vozareviƒá bookstore, the first bookstore in Belgrade. This library formed the basis for the National Library of Serbia. The brothers jointly restored the medieval Naupara monastery, built c. 1381, which was demolished by the Turks in 1454 and remained in ruins until 1835.

The pairing is a manifestation of shipping, a phenomenon in fandom wherein individuals create fan works that depict a romantic or sexual relationship between two characters whose relationship in the source material is typically neither romantic nor sexual; Stucky is an example of slash, a genre of fan works that focus on same-sex characters. In accordance with shipping naming conventions, Stucky is a portmanteau of \\"Steve\\" and \\"Bucky\\". Though Rogers and Barnes have appeared in media dating to the 1940s, Stucky fan works grew substantially in popularity in the 2010s following their appearances in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Several individuals associated with Marvel, including Winter Soldier co-creator Ed Brubaker, Barnes's actor Sebastian Stan, and MCU director Joe Russo, have commented positively on Stucky, frequently in a context that affirms Rogers's and Barnes's canonical heterosexuality while offering support for the broader Stucky fandom. Critics and commentators have used the popularity of Stucky in fandom to remark on a range of topics, including the lack of LGBT characters in superhero films and the nature of fandom on social media. Background =Marvel Comics= Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes first appeared in Captain America Comics #1 (March 1941), which establishes Rogers as Captain America and Barnes as his teenaged sidekick. Barnes would be killed in 1948 and would not re-appear until Captain America (vol. 5) in 2005, where the character is brought back from his previous apparent death as the Winter Soldier, a brainwashed assassin. As a result of Barnes's extended absence from comics, and Rogers's initial characterization as a much older paternal figure to Barnes, the emergence of Stucky as a phenomenon in fandom is a relatively recent development; in pre-social media shipping fandom of the early 2000s, Rogers was most commonly depicted with Tony Stark (Iron Man) in a pairing typically abbreviated as \\"Stony\\" or \\"Superhusbands\\". While hero-and-sidekick relationships in comics have been interpreted as having a homoerotic subtext, in Marvel canon, the relationship between Rogers and Barnes is strictly platonic, and is not depicted as sexual or romantic. Rogers and Barnes are depicted in-canon as having a deep and meaningful personal bond, some critics likening their relationship as wartime compatriots to Achilles and Patroclus. =Marvel Cinematic Universe= The popularity of Stucky as a ship in fandom rose substantially following the introduction of Rogers and Barnes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), where they have jointly appeared in five films: Captain America: The First Avenger (2011), Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Captain America: Civil War (2016), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019). The films re-conceptualize the nature of their relationship, presenting them as same-age lifelong best friends, and establish their bond as a key plot element and mutual character motivation. As a result, a shipping or \\"ship\\" fandom developed in reaction to a supposed homoerotic subtext to Rogers's and Barnes's relationship, wherein individuals create fan works that depict the characters in a romantic or sexual relationship; Stucky is an example of slash, a genre of fan works featuring characters of the same sex. Across the Captain America trilogy of films, Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of The Daily Dot notes that Rogers continually \\"rebel[s] against authority for the sake of Bucky's wellbeing, escalating from disobeying orders in World WarII to becoming an international fugitive in Civil War\\". The relationship serves as the driving plot to The Winter Soldier, where Barnes's memory of Rogers causes him to overcome his conditioning as a brainwashed assassin; Barnes recalls his identity through Rogers's declaration of \\"I'm with you till the end of the line\\", a phrase repeated by Rogers and Barnes throughout the series as an expression of kinship. Civil War again depicts their relationship as a central plot element, Rogers protecting Barnes after he is wrongly accused of committing a terrorist act, while also developing Sharon Carter as a love interest for Rogers. While Carter has an established history as a canonical love interest for Rogers in the comics, Joanna Robinson wrote in Vanity Fair that the depiction of Carter was the \\"one flaw in the otherwise great\\" film, arguing that the film's kiss between Rogers and Carter exists primarily to \\"put the nail in the coffin of speculation\\" around a homoerotic interpretation of Rogers's and Barnes's relationship. Rogers and Barnes appear in the next two films, Infinity War and Endgame, but less time is spent on their relationship. Robinson and other critics hypothesized that their interactions were minimized to build popularity for Sam Wilson / Falcon as he assumes the title of Captain America, and to emphasize the canonical love story between Rogers and Peggy Carter. Analysis and impact Stucky as a phenomenon in fandom emerged from online communities that produce fan works. These online communities are typically mostly female, in contrast to the majority male mainstream comics fandom. Fan works featuring Stucky, which have been created in a wide range of media, including fan art, fanfiction, and fan videos, typically give prominence to emotional imagery and romantic subject material, as opposed to the action- and conflict-centered narratives of Marvel's comic and film source material. Stucky fan works thus \\"realize all the un-filmed narrative moments that fans want to see\\", with depictions of Rogers's and Barnes's domestic life in 1940s New Yorklargely unexplored in canonical source materialbeing a common trope in Stucky fan works. These works are often faithful to the real-world history of pre-war gay culture in New York City; Gay New York, a sociological text by LGBT historian George Chauncey, has been used by some fan creators to accurately depict aspects of this history, including real-life period-specific gay bars that existed in Rogers's canonical Brooklyn neighborhood. Francesca Coppa argues that the Stucky fandom is the result of a \\"complex mix of objectification and identification with these characters\\", wherein the desire to see sexual or romantic scenarios involving Rogers and Barnes is based in part on sexual or romantic attraction to these characters that fans themselves possess. Coppa goes on to argue that Stucky represents not merely the objectification of two physically attractive male characters, but also the subjectification of Steve Rogers as character, \\"with fans writing stories that flesh out his politics, his relationships past and present, his religion, and his sexuality\\". In Captain America, Masculinity, and Violence: The Evolution of a National Icon, author J. Richard Stevens similarly argues that fans of Captain America use the character \\"to reconstruct and reconfigure cultural significance in their own lives\\", noting that \\"throughout the character's history, which contains messages from ultranationalist jingoism to a critique of the role of nationalism in the propagation of racism and terrorism, [Captain America's] narratives have provoked incredibly articulate responses.\\" In the specific case of Stucky, Coppa notes that the unlikelihood of Marvel's acknowledging a queer reading of Rogers's and Barnes's relationship in canon \\"means that much fan energy is spent visualizing what a queer superhero relationship might look like\\". In this regard, Stucky as a phenomenon in shipping is notable in that it devotes significant focus to the characters' imagined gay or bisexual sexual identity, in contrast to slash fan works of the 1970s and 1980s that \\"distanc[ed] beloved characters from the stereotypes and even the identity of gayness\\", opting to instead depict the characters as \\"sharing a great, transcendent love that eliminated the boundaries of gender\\". The popularity of Stucky in fandom has been widely commented on by mainstream pop culture and entertainment sources. In Tumblr's annual rankings of the most popular ships of the year (as measured by number of reblogs), Stucky placed 17th in 2014, 9th in 2015, 8th in 2016, 10th in 2018, and 16th in 2019. , over 45,000 Stucky fan works have been published on Archive of Our Own. =#GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend= In May 2016, Twitter user Jess Salerno tweeted \\"#givecaptainamericaaboyfriend\\" in response to a similar internet campaign around the hashtag #GiveElsaAGirlfriend, which focused on Elsa from the 2013 film Frozen. The hashtag became a viral trending topic on Twitter, and was widely covered by the mainstream press. While the hashtag was ostensibly organized around fans who wished to see Stucky made canon, both it and #GiveElsaAGirlfriend were also broadly concerned with the lack of LGBT characters in media properties owned by Disney, of which Marvel is a subsidiary. The LGBT rights organization GLAAD commented that the hashtag was \\"a sign that audiences are eager for significant LGBT characters in their superhero movies\\". The Hollywood Reporter cited #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend as an example of how social media has altered the dynamic between creators and audiences, as the medium increases both visibility of fan discussions and the willingness of creators to respond to those discussions. The outlet further commented that #GiveCaptainAmericaABoyfriend \\"highlights demographic shifts that have yet to be reflected in the texts audiences are responding to\\", in reference to the popularity of Stucky relative to the lack of LGBT characters in superhero films. Response from Marvel Several individuals affiliated with Marvel have commented on Stucky, frequently in a context that affirms Rogers's and Barnes's canonical heterosexuality while offering support for the broader Stucky fandom. Rogers's actor Chris Evans has commented positively on romantic interpretations on Rogers's relationship with Barnes, though he said that \\"it's just never been part of my approach to the character.\\" When asked about Stucky in a separate interview with GQ, Barnes's actor Sebastian Stan similarly responded that \\"I think it's great. Movies are for people to relate to in whatever way they want,\\" adding that \\"I don't think of the character that way, though. But there's no right or wrong answer.\\" Evans has also remarked that Barnes is \\"one of the more precious relationships for Steve Rogers [...] it's one of the few relationships that he can identify as anything we would call home,\\" which has been quoted by outlets in the context of their coverage of Stucky. An image from a fan photo op of Evans and Stan at Wizard World Philadelphia posing with cosplayers kissing while dressed as Rogers and Barnes went viral in 2016. Joe Russo, who co-directed four of the five MCU films in which Rogers and Barnes jointly appear, has described their relationship as a love story but also indicated the kind of emotional connection to be that between brothers, later saying that \\"people have interpreted that relationship all kinds of ways, and it's great to see people argue about it, what that relationship means to them. We will never define it as filmmakers, explicitly, but however people want to interpret it, they can interpret it.\\" Screenwriters Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, who jointly wrote the Captain America film trilogy, Infinity War, and Endgame, likened the Rogers‚ÄìBarnes relationship to a love story and described the characters as soulmates in the foreword of the trade paperback edition of the comic book series Captain America: White. Other individuals who have remarked positively on Stucky include writers Ed Brubaker, who co-created the Winter Soldier with artist Steve Epting, and Mark Waid, who remarked in an interview with Marvel regarding his 2016 run on the comic book series Black Widow that both Black Widow and Barnes \\"have had a crush\\" on Steve Rogers. A scene in the 2019 comic book Gwenpool Strikes Back #3 in which Gwenpool (a character who is aware she is in a comic book) says that Rogers and Barnes \\"look good together\\" was interpreted by commentators as a humorous acknowledgement of the Stucky fandom by Marvel.

Early Kurdology Throughout the 17th and the 18th centuries, most works on the Kurds attempted to ascertain the origins of the Kurdish people and their language. Different theories existed including the beliefs that Kurdish was closely related to Turkic languages, that it was a rude and uneducated Persian dialect or that Kurds were originally Chaldeans. Early Kurdology is characterized by the lack of an institutionalized approach and tended to lack critical contextualization. In a sanctioned trip by Russian Academy of Sciences from 1768 to 1774, naturalist Johann Anton G√ºldenst√§dt travelled to the southern border of the Russian Empire to explore the Caucasus and the Kurds in Georgia. In his travel notes published between 1787 and 1791, G√ºldenst√§dt erroneously claimed that Kurds were Tatars and his translations also had inaccuracies because of communication issues with his informants. His claim that Kurdish was related to Turkic languages was nevertheless rejected by German librarian Johann Adelung who argued that Kurds were related to Corduene basing his argument on Xenophon and his work Anabasis from around 370 BC. The Spanish Jesuit Lorenzo Herv√°s y Panduro also examined the Kurdish language in his Vocabolario poligloto () in 1787 and argued that:  Kurdology by region  = Italy = Kurds became known for the first time in Europe through Dominican Order. In the beginning, it was Italians who carried out research on the Kurds on behalf of the Vatican. A monk, Domenico Lanza, lived between 1753 and 1771 near Mosul and published a book titled Compendiose realizione istorica dei viaggi fatti dal Padre Domenico Lanza dell'Ordine dei Predicatori de Roma in Oriente dall'anno 1753 al 1771. The missionary and traveler Maurizio Garzoni spent 20 years with the Kurds of Amadiya and Mosul and wrote an Italian-Kurdish dictionary with around 4,500 words between 1764 and 1770. This work was published in Rome in 1787 under the name Grammatica e Vocabolario della Lingua Kurdi. With the growing interest in Europe about the Ottoman Empire, other people became aware of the Kurds. Garzoni's book was reissued in 1826. The first European book dealing with the religion of the Kurds appeared in Naples in 1818. It was called Storia della regione Kurdistan e delle sette di religio ivi esistenti and was written by Giuseppe Campanile. The Italian missionary and researcher Alessandro de Bianchi published in 1863 a book on Kurdish culture, traditions and history. = Germany = The earliest mention of the Kurds in a German work comes from Johann Schitberger from the year 1473. In 1799, Johann Adam Bergk also mentions Kurds in his geography book. During his stay in the Ottoman Empire, Helmuth von Moltke reported about Kurds in his work letters about the events in Turkey. The Kurds were also mentioned in the German literature, the most prominent example being Karl May's in 1892 published Durchs wilde Kurdistan. The period from 1840 to 1930 was the most productive period of Kurdology in Germany. Germany was at the time the center of Kurdish studies in Europe. Due to its good relations with the Ottoman Empire, German researchers were able to access to the Ottoman lands and its inhabitants with relative ease. At the present time Humboldt University of Berlin, University of Vienna, University of G√∂ttingen, University of Erfurt and Free University of Berlin offer Kurdish oriented courses in Germany, either as a sole study or as a part of wider Iranian studies. = Russia = During its expansion Russia also was in contact with the Ottoman Empire, that often resulted in conflicts. Russia's access to Black Sea and the Caucasus brought the country in contact with eastern part of the Ottoman Empire, where they then began their research on the Kurds. In 1879 Russian-Polish diplomat from Erzurum August Ko≈õciesza-≈ªaba published a Franco- Kurdish dictionary with the help of Mahmud Bayazidi. The center of Kurdish studies was the University of St. Petersburg. ≈ªaba and other diplomats like Basil Nikitin collected Kurdish manuscripts and recorded oral histories. Among other things, the Sharafnama was translated into Russian for the first time. = Turkey = Due to the Turkish state policy, the Kurdish people and their culture were not deemed as a research topic for decades. Some early works on Kurds, such as by Fahrettin Kƒ±rzƒ±oƒülu, portrayed the Kurds as a Turkic or Turanian population group and were consistent with the state backed Turkish History Thesis. First studies that deviated from the state view were published by ƒ∞smail Be≈üik√ßi. It was only after the relaxation of Turkish-Kurdish relations that academic papers on the Kurds appeared. At the Mardin Artuklu √úniversitesi, which was founded in 2007, a chair for Kurdish language and literature was established as a part of the Institute of Living Languages.

Description The border starts in the west at Beninese tripoint in the Niger river, then proceeds overland in a northwards direction, before turning eastwards in a broad arc. The border then proceeds eastwards in a broadly eastwards direction, though with considerable undulation, before reaching the Komadougou Yobe river; the boundary then follows this river eastwards to the tripoint with Chad in Lake Chad. The border cuts through the densely-populated cultural region known as Hausaland, with Hausa speakers forming the majority on both sides of the frontier.William F. S. Miles., Hausaland Divided: Colonialism and Independence in Nigeria and Niger, Cornell University Press, 1994 History The border first emerged during the Scramble for Africa, a period of intense competition between European powers in the later 19th century for territory and influence in Africa. The process culminated in the Berlin Conference of 1884, in which the European nations concerned agreed upon their respective territorial claims and the rules of engagements going forward. As a result of this France gained control of the upper valley of the Niger River (roughly equivalent to the areas of modern Mali and Niger). Meanwhile Britain, which had (via the Royal Niger Company) administered the area around Lagos since 1861 and the Oil River Protectorate (Calabar are the surrounding area) since 1884, would have priority in the areas south of the upper Niger region. From their respective bases both nations gradually extended their rule into the interior. France has conquered the area of modern Niger in 1900; initially ruled as a military territory, it was later included within the federal colony of French West Africa (Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise, abbreviated AOF). The British likewise extended their rule inland from their Lagos and Calabar bases, forming two additional colonies - the Southern Nigeria Protectorate and the Northern Nigeria Protectorate. In 1900 rule of these areas was transferred to the British government, with the Northern and Southern (including Lagos and Calabar) protectorates united as the colony of Nigeria in 1914. Britain and France had signed a treaty on 5 August 1890, agreeing that their respective territories would be divided by a line from Say to Baroua near Lake Chad; this line was in general further north than the current border. This boundary line was further delimited in 1898, 1904 and 1906, being finalised at its current location in 1910. A series of beacons and markers were thereafter placed on the ground to physically demarcate the border. After the Second World War both Britain and France committed to the decolonisation of their African territories.

Description The starts at the tripoint with Burkina Faso in the M√©krou River, following this river in a north-eastwards direction before reaching the Niger river. The border then follows the Niger down to Nigerian tripoint. The entire M√©krou river section of the boundary falls within the trans-border W National Park, home to numerous species such as hippos and elephants. Furthermore, the Nigerien side of the Niger river section is protected as the Dosso Reserve, which protects one of the last remaining populations of West African giraffe.The Annotated Ramsar List: Niger , Dallol Bosso. 26 April 2004 History The 1880s saw an intense competition between the European powers for territories in Africa, a process known as the Scramble for Africa. This culminated in the Berlin Conference of 1884, in which the European nations concerned agreed upon their respective territorial claims and the rules of engagements going forward. As a result of this France gained control of the upper valley of the Niger River (roughly equivalent to the areas of modern Mali and Niger). France began occupying the area of modern Benin from 1893, later naming it Dahomey; the area encompassing the territory of modern Niger was conquered in 1900. Both areas came the control of the federal colony of French West Africa (Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise, abbreviated AOF).Decree 7 September 1911, rattachant le territoire militaire du Niger au gouvernement g√©n√©ral de l'Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise, published in the Official Journal of the French Republic on 12 Septembre 1911 (Online) The rivers Niger and M√©krou were confirmed as forming the boundary between Niger and Dahomey in a French statute of 27 October 1938. As the movement for decolonisation grew in the post-Second World War era, France gradually granted more political rights and representation for its African colonies, culminating in the granting of broad internal autonomy to each colony in 1958 within the framework of the French Community. In August 1960 both Niger and Dahomey (renamed Benin in 1975) gained full independence, and their mutual frontier became an international one between two sovereign states. Since independence there were a number of disputes over the precise allocation of 24 riverine islands, most notably L√©t√© Island, none of which had been covered by the colonial-era boundary agreement. The two states forwarded the case to the International Court of Justice in 2001; in 2005 the ICJ adjudicated on the matter, awarding 16 islands to Niger and nine to Benin.Fabio Spadi (2005) The ICJ Judgment in the Benin-Niger Border Dispute: the interplay of titles and ‚Äòeffectivit√©s‚Äô under the uti possidetis juris principle, Leiden Journal of International Law 18: 777-794De la loi autorisant ratification de la loi no. 2001-25 du 9 novembre 2002, relative au compromis de saisine de la Cour Internationale de Justice, La Revue L√©gislative (Publication de l‚ÄôAssembl√©e nationale du Niger), F√®vrier 2003 - No.01, page 22-24.

It is native to Northern, Central and Eastern Europe and has spread to Western Europe, North America and elsewhere. Description Wingless adults are some shade of green, sometimes with a slight waxy covering, and grow to a length of about . The siphunculi (slender tubes on the fifth abdominal segment) are cylindrical, pale and slightly S-shaped, and are much longer than the cauda (tail-like protrusion). Distribution and host range Elatobium abietinum is native to Northern, Central and Eastern Europe where its original host is Picea abies. From this range it has spread to Western Europe where plantations of P. abies have been established, and expanded its host range to include Picea sitchensis and other Picea spp., and occasionally on fir (Abies spp.). It has been introduced into Iceland, New Zealand, Tasmania, Chile and other regions where P. abies is grown in plantations. In North America it has become established and further extended its host range from P. sitchensis on the Pacific coast to Picea engelmannii and Picea pungens inland. Altogether it has been recorded feeding on 14 species of Picea and on 5 species of Abies. Ecology Elatobium abietinum has an unusual life cycle and feeds solely on coniferous trees. Wingless adult females often continue feeding and producing young parthenogenetically throughout the winter. In spring, winged aphids are produced and fly to other trees. Young nymphs enter diapause during the summer, recommencing development in the autumn. In Europe, males occur and there is a sexual phase, but in the other parts of the world, only females are known. Invertebrate predators of this aphid in Wales include brown lacewings (Hemerobiidae), soldier beetles (Malthodes and Rhagonycha, Cantharidae), ladybirds (Coccinellidae) and hoverfly larvae (Syrphidae). Many small passerine birds feed on aphids, especially when they are feeding their young; they include warblers, sparrows, tits and chickadees, some finches, and woodpeckers. Damage Elatobium abietinum-related damage to sitka spruce, Washington state, USA, 1932 Elatobium abietinum feeds by sucking sap from spruce needles, often causing defoliation of older needles and wilting of young growth. The presence of the aphids weakens the tree by decreasing growth rates and making it more susceptible to attack by other pests such as the spruce beetle (Dendroctonus rufipennis). Serious defoliation can kill the tree.

Early History On 19 April 1922 the Afrikaanse Medium Ho√´rskool opened inside a small church in Potchefstroom. Originally with only 38 standard six (now grade 8) students and two teachers: Mr J.D. Grundlingh and Mrs. Nellie Chessworth, the school's first acting principal was Mr. P.M. van der Lingen. It was on 11 October 1922 that Mr. J.C. Pauw became the school's first permanent principal. Mr. A.J.P. \\"Koos\\" Burger became its first permanent teacher a few months later. In early 1923, the school moved to a refurbished iron building, now with nearly 140 students ranging from standard seven to eight (now grades 9 and 10). The school's governing body decided to change the school's name to Ho√´r Volkskool Potchefstroom on the 30th of October, 1923. The cornerstone of the permanent school building, still in use to the present day, was laid on the 10th of June 1927 and it was put into use on 23 February the following year. Amongst the speakers at the official opening was then Administrator of the Transvaal, Jan H. Hofmeyr. In 1934 Pauw was instated as the Inspector of Education in the Transvaal, and Mr. C.H. Steyn took over as principal. Colours and Motto The school's colours were decided on in 1925 and consisted of black (inspired by Mr. Pauw's beloved jacket), gold (representing Potchefstroom's rich gold reserves) and red to form a harmony between them .The school's motto, Sapientia Vis Vera, means \\"Wisdom is true power\\" and was introduced along with the current badge in 1926. It was suggested by co-founder, Mr. Van der Lingen. Sport =Cricket= Volkies has high quality cricket facilities, including indoor and outdoor nets and three cricket fields.

Ramayyan's next target was the Neerazhi Palace of Thekkumkur at Changanassery. The Thekkumkur had a larger and stronger army than the other princely states (Kayamkulam, Ampalapuzha) conquered by the Ramayan.

Family The Casamajor de Charritte was an old Basque-B√©arnaise family. His great grandfather Guicharnaud de Casamajor, a notary who became treasurer and receiver general of the Kingdom of Navarre, was ennobled in 1583 by Henry III of Navarre, who later became Henry IV of France. His grandfather Josu√© de Casamajor married Jeanne de Charritte in 1608. He was one of eight children of Isaac de Casamajor de Charritte and Marie de Maytie. Jean-Pierre de Casamajor de Charritte was born in the ch√¢teau de Charritte and baptized on 10 September 1648 in the Charritte parish church. Early career (1673‚Äì1705) Charritte entered the Gardes de la Marine at the age of 25, and campaigned with them in Canada, on the coast of Africa and in the Leeward Islands. He became a ship- of-the-line ensign (enseigne de vaisseau) in January 1689, and after a long period at sea was promoted to lieutenant on 1 June 1693. The next year he was given command of the royal frigate Lutin with orders to cruise around the √éle d'Yeu. While in command of the Lutin he was ordered to escort a convoy of about 150 sail. It was attacked by a Dutch frigate from Vlissingen of 22 cannons and two Spanish corvettes of 10‚Äì12 cannons each. Three times through rapid and skillful maneuvers Charitte avoided being boarded. On the fourth attack, which was also repulsed, a shot from a falconet passed through Carritte's neck from side to side, and his shoulder and jaw were broken by fire from a musket. From that day, Charritte could only swallow liquid food. However, he had saved the convoy. News of the brilliant feat of arms was quickly taken to the French court at Versailles, where on 1 January 1697 King Louis XIV of France awarded Carritte an lifetime annual pension of 500 livres. A few months later Charritte was named the king's lieutenant on the island of Saint Croix, and was given command of the Pressante, a frigate with 12 cannon and a crew of 50. First he was ordered to protect an important convoy of merchant vessels from La Rochelle to Bordeaux. Three ships flying foreign flags were seen on the first day of the voyage. Charitte dropped to the rear to deal with them. One was a frigate with 22 cannon and 100 men, and the other two were corvettes, one with 8 cannons and 70 men and the other with 6 cannon and sixty men. Charitte resisted the combined attack of the three corsairs, despite being greatly outnumbered, and put up a fierce fire when they made three attempts to close. They were repulsed each time, and eventually broke away. At the recommendation of Louis Ph√©lypeaux, comte de Pontchartrain, Charitte was decorated with the Order of Saint Louis for this naval action. In 1698 Charritte married Marie Louise de La Doubart de Beaumanoir. They had two sons. Charritte took up his post as the king's lieutenant on the island of Saint Croix. He was then appointed the king's lieutenant in Tortuga and Le Cap. Interim governor of Saint-Domingue (1705‚Äì1707) Charles Auger, governor of Saint-Domingue, died in L√©og√¢ne on 13 October 1705. Charite took over as interim governor. In 1706, despite France and Spain being at war, the French and Spanish on Santo Domingo were coexisting peacefully. The minister wrote to Charitte telling him to stop the trade with the Spanish using small Dutch ships from Cura√ßao. The success of d'Iberville and Chavagnac in their raid on Saint Kitts and Nevis might cause the English to attack, and Charitte should take all measures needed to prepare to resist them. At this time Charitte was having difficulty dealing with disturbances in the colony that had followed the death of Auger. Charitte had an impetuous nature, and was involved in some commercial frauds, which resulted in complaints against him. D'Iberville arrived at L√©ogane and found the buccaneers there willing to attack Jamaica, but died in Havana in July 1706 before being able to execute this plan. Chavitte limited himself with some measures to protect the coast of Saint-Domingue from English corsairs. He also encouraged the buccaneers to attack the English. In 1706 he entrusted the 20-year-old privateer Pierre Morpain with command of the Intr√©pide. He was later involved in a dispute with Pierre Morpain and his buccaneers when he seized a frigate captured by Morpain and resold it at a huge profit. Fran√ßois-Joseph, comte de Choiseul-Beaupr√© was named governor on 1 August 1706, and was received by the council of Le Cap on 28 December 1707. Choiseuil fell out with the ordonnateur Jean-Jacques Mithon de Senneville over a decision over valuation of currencies then being used on the island, which had to be referred to the minister for resolution. He also quarreled with Charitte, who complained to the minister. Choiseuil probably would have been recalled if it were not for his relations at court. Interim governor of Saint-Domingue (1711‚Äì1712) On 22 September 1710 Choisel was recalled and Laurent de Valernod was appointed interim governor. He was received at Le Cap on 7 February 1711. He died in Petit-Go√¢ve on 24 May 1711, and Charite again became interim governor of Saint-Domingue. On 1 September 1711 Charite was named governor of Martinique. He refused the governorship of Martinique so he could oversee his plantations in Saint-Domingue. On 1 September 1711 Nicolas de Gabaret (1641‚Äì1712) was named governor of Saint- Domingue in place of Choiseul, but he did not take up the offer and died in Martinique in 25 June 1712. Then Paul-Fran√ßois de La Grange d'Arquien was named interim governor on 18 June 1712 and was received by the council of Le Cap on 29 August 1712. Charitte found himself unemployed. In 1716 Charitte was made lieutenant to the governor general of Saint-Domingue, and held this position until his death. Charritte died on 17 October 1723 at the age of 75. √âtienne Cochard de Chastenoye succeeded him as governor of Saint Croix and Le Cap. According to M√©d√©ric Louis √âlie Moreau de Saint-M√©ry, Charritte was mild and popular, an enemy of despotism, but his character was marred by an insatiable cupidity.

It acted as one of the main eastern city gates until falling into disuse and disappearing. It was excavated and restored as part of the creation of Al-Azhar Park in the 2000s.  History  Bab al-Barqiyya (also known as Bab al-Tawfiq) was originally an eastern gate in the Fatimid walls built by the vizier Badr al- Gamali.Raymond, Andr√©. 1993. Le Caire. Fayard. It was rebuilt in the 12th to 13th centuries under an ambitious fortification project begun in 1176 by Salah ad-Din (Saladin) and continued by his Ayyubid successors. This project included the construction of the Citadel of Cairo and of a 20 kilometer-long wall to defend both Cairo (originally the royal city of the Fatimid caliphs) and Fustat (the earlier capital of Egypt to the southwest). The entirety of the envisioned course of the wall was never quite completed, but long stretches of the wall, especially north of the Citadel, were built. Bab al- Barqiyya was one of the gates in this completed northern section, along with the gates identified as Bab al-Mahruq and Bab al-Jadid. The gate was one of the main eastern gates of the city. Outside it was a desert area which was initially by the Mamluks used for equestrian games, a tradition started by Baybars and ended in 1320 by al-Nasir Muhammad. Later on, during the Burji Mamluk period, this area was the site of new Mamluk mausoleum complexes, now known as the Northern Cemetery. In the meantime, however, the city's growth and the relative security of the region made Bab al-Barqiyya's function as defensive gate less and less important. The gate, and the Ayyubid walls around it, fell into disuse and the inhabitants of the city built new houses and structures into them or on top of them. Over time, the eastern edge of the city, where the walls once stood, became a dumping ground for the city's detritus. The walls and gates disappeared under a growing mound of debris (though they remained largely intact). In the early 2000s, the rubbish hills east of the historic city were transformed by the Aga Khan Trust for Culture into al-Azhar Park, opened in 2005. In the process, the eastern Ayyubid city walls were excavated and restored between 2000 and 2008, including Bab al- Barqiyya. The gate is now visible on the western edge of the park. Another nearby gate further south, Bab al-Mahruq, was also transformed into the western entrance to the park from the Darb al-Ahmar neighbourhood.  Description  The gate, built in stone, had a complex design typical of Middle-Eastern medieval fortified gates known as a \\"bent entrance\\". Rather than a simple opening in the walls where traffic goes straight through, the gate forces traffic to pass sideways through the gate by effecting two 90-degree turns in and out of the gate. This design was intended to impede direct assaults and force any attackers to slow down as they entered the gate.

She is responsible for popularizing a version of the belly dance in Iran, and was reportedly the highest-paid cabaret actor of Iranian origin in 1974. She has also performed acting and dancing roles in many Iranian films of the 1960s and 1970s.  Biography  = Early life = Fatimah Sadiqi was born in 1946 in Tehran, Iran. Her father, Rajab V√¢ksi, was a walnut seller who later became an actor in the siy√¢h theater scene in Iran. Her uncle, Mor-shed Nasroll√¢h, was a zarb player and an itinerant bard. As a child, she became proficient in the belly dance and often performed with her father. = Dancing career = Jamileh dancing for Greek tycoon Aristotle Onassis in Tehran, Iran in 1972 Jamileh began her dancing career in the theater scene, and mostly performed a self-taught style of Bollywood dance in traditional caf√©s. Her first marriage was to J.R., a singer of the ruhowzi genre of musical comedy in traditional Persian theater. She then married Mohammed Arb√¢b, the owner of the Bakara- Mulan Ruzh cabaret. After marrying Arb√¢b, she continued dancing and performed in cabarets such as Arb√¢b's Bakara-Mulan Ruzh as well as in her own cabaret, Lidu. Her marriage to Arb√¢b lasted until his death in 1973. Much like other Iranian entertainers of the 20th century, including Susan, Delkash, and Googoosh, Jamileh's career dancing in cabarets provided her the opportunity to enter Iranian cinema, which would eventually lead her to national fame. She began her acting career after her marriage to Arb√¢b, aiming to be recognized as a \\"dancer-actor\\" in Iranian cinema, like Samia Gamal in Egyptian cinema. She mainly played dance-related roles in more than 25 films, including roles in Zan-i Vahshi-i Vahshi (1969), Dukhtar-i Zalim Bala (1970), and Arus-i Pabirahnah (1974). Many of the films she starred in were produced by Firdawsi Film, owned by her husband Arb√¢b, including the 1971 film Khushgiltarin Zan-i Alam. She was reportedly the highest-paid cabaret actor of Iranian origin in 1974, and performed for prominent foreign guests including Henry Kissinger and Aristotle Onassis. = Career after Iran = After fleeing Iran, Jamileh continued her dancing career in Los Angeles, California, where she now resides. She performed frequently at the Cabaret Tehran in Los Angeles for more than 20 years and through her fifties.  Legacy  Although dancers like Mahvash and Afat first introduced the belly dance and other Persian folk dances in Iranian cinema, Jamileh was responsible for popularizing a version of the dance in Iran through her performances and film roles. She is a master of Persian dances, including the traditional Bandari and Qasemabadi dances, and some classical Persian dances, and became known for her specific style of the belly dance, as well as Persian dances such as the j√¢heli dance style. The j√¢heli style of dance involves imitating a roughneck, j√¢hel man, and is more overtly erotic compared to more traditional Persian dances. It is often performed wearing a kol√¢h makhmali, a type of hat similar to a fedora. According to Ida Meftahi, a historian specializing in modern Iranian history, Jamileh was not associated with the image of a stereotypical cabaret dancer in the media, but the image of \\"a valuable artist\\" that was likely improved with the help of her husband's influence. Sheila Eghbali, the primary organizer of the International Iranian Dance Conference and the artistic director of Iranian Dance Artists, has claimed that \\"while people enjoyed watching her [Jamileh],... [Jamileh] made dance and dancing in public seem something associated with cabaret dancing, inappropriate, showing too much skin, not really about culture, more about entertaining men\\".  Filmography  Jamileh's dancing and acting roles in Iranian cinema include: * Gohar-e shab- cheragh (The luminescent jewel, 1967) * Zan-i Vahshi-i Vahshi (The wild, wild woman, 1969) * Dukhtar-i Zalim Bala (The beautiful tyrant of a girl, 1970) * Khushgiltarin Zan-i Alam (1971) * Arus-i Pabirahnah (The barefoot bride, 1974) * Sharaf (The honour, 1975) * Gol Pari Joon (1974) * Jedal (1976)  See also  * Persian dance  Citations   Sources      External links  * * Video of Jamileh performing the j√¢heli dance Category:1946 births Category:Living people Category:People from Tehran Category:Belly dancers Category:Cabaret performers Category:Iranian expatriates in the United States Category:Iranian film actresses Category:Iranian women dancers ","title":"Jamileh (dancer)"},{"id":"62289121","text":"Andersonville Commercial Historic District Swedes constitute a considerable ethnic group in Chicago, where a little over 15,000 people are of Swedish ancestry. History Like other European ethnic groups, people left Sweden in search of better economic opportunities during the mid-1800s. In the year 1900, Chicago was the city with the second highest number of Swedes after Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. By then, Swedes in Chicago, most of whom settled in the Andersonville neighborhood, especially in the years following the Great Chicago Fire, had founded the Evangelical Covenant Church and established such enduring institutions as Swedish Covenant Hospital and North Park University. The fire destroyed much of the Swedish-American community, including four Swedish churches, and as many Swedish newspapers. Other Swedish neighborhoods included Lake View, which at its peak had about 20,000 Swedes. In addition to Chicago, Swedish immigrants settled in Rockford and other parts of Illinois.\\"The Undeveloped West or, Five Years in the Territories\\" Page 39, 1873 Like other Swedish-American communities, the Chicago Swedes had their own newspaper, Hemlandet (Swedish for \\"The Homeland\\").

Many Chicago Swedes entered the construction business as part working their way up the economic ladder, though most started as carpenters and laborers. The Gust K.

Jones (October 6, 1894 - January 22, 1969) was a career officer in the United States Army. He attained the rank of major general, and was best known for his command of the 106th Infantry Division during World War II. Early life Alan Walter Jones Sr. was born in Goldendale, Washington on October 6, 1894, a son of Jessie M. Jones and Milton S Jones. He was raised in Walla Walla, Washington, and attended Whitman College and the University of Washington. Jones was working as a laborer for the Union Pacific Railroad in Seattle in 1917 when he applied for a commission in the U.S. Army. Jones' application was approved in October 1917, and he was commissioned a second lieutenant of Infantry and assigned to the 43rd Infantry Regiment. After completing his in processing at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, Jones joined his regiment at Fort Douglas, Utah. During World War I, Jones was promoted to first lieutenant and then temporary captain, and served at posts including Camp Pike, Arkansas and Pensacola, Florida. After the war, Jones reverted to his permanent rank of first lieutenant and continued his army career. Military education Jones was a 1925 graduate of the Infantry Officer Course. In 1930 he completed the Infantry Officer Advanced Course. He was then selected for attendance at the Field Artillery Officer Advanced Course, from which he graduated in 1931. Jones graduated from the United States Army Command and General Staff College in 1936. Chosen for further professional education at the United States Army War College, Jones began attending in 1937 and graduated in 1938. Post-World War I In 1920, Jones was promoted to permanent captain. He continued to serve in Infantry assignments, including an early 1920s posting to the Philippines with the 45th Infantry Regiment. In the late 1920s, Jones served on the staff of the Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia and in 1929 he was assigned to Camp Perry, Ohio as a faculty member for a newly organized program of marksmanship instruction which preceded an annual military shooting competition. In the early 1930s, Jones served with the 12th Infantry Regiment at Fort Washington, Maryland, followed by an assignment to the staff of the Army's Chief of Infantry. He was promoted to major in 1934, and served with the 7th Infantry Regiment at Vancouver Barracks, Washington. In 1938, Jones was posted to the 19th Infantry Regiment at Schofield Barracks, Hawaii, and he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1940. World War II Jones while serving as commander of the 106th Infantry Division. From Generals of the Ardennes: American Leadership in the Battle of the Bulge. Jones was ordered to the Army staff at the War Department in 1941, and assigned to the office of the deputy chief of staff for operations and training, G-3. In December 1941, Jones was promoted to colonel. Jones was assigned to the staff of the Army Ground Forces headquarters in April 1942, and in June he received promotion to brigadier general. After becoming a general officer, Jones was assigned as assistant division commander of the 90th Infantry Division, where he served until January 1943. =106th Infantry Division= In January 1943, Jones was assigned to command the 106th Infantry Division during its organization and training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina. He was promoted to major general in March. The 106th Division trained at Fort Jackson and participated in the Second Army's 1943 and 1944 Tennessee Maneuvers. In March 1944, the 106th Infantry Division moved to Camp Atterbury, Indiana, where many of its soldiers received new assignments as replacements for soldiers killed and wounded in combat and postings to units of the Army Service Forces. Newly assigned soldiers were not as experienced and trained as their predecessors. In October 1944, the division moved to Massachusetts, where it embarked for transport to Europe. The division arrived in Belgium in early December and was immediately transferred to the front lines near St. Vith and the Ardennes forest, where it relieved the 2nd Infantry Division on December 12. Four days after the 106th Infantry Division took its place on the front lines, the German army began the offensive that became known as the Battle of the Bulge. Jones' inexperienced division initially performed well, but quickly became combat ineffective, with two of its three regiments, the 422nd and 423rd Infantry, encircled and cut off near Sch√∂nberg in Eupen- Malmedy, which resulted in their surrender to the Germans. During the fighting, Jones was agitated and apprehensive over the loss of the regiments, one of which included his son, who was a captain in the 423rd Infantry. He suffered a heart attack and on December 22 turned command of the division over to his deputy, Herbert T. Perrin. Jones was then assigned as deputy to his superior, XVIII Airborne Corps commander Matthew Ridgway. In March 1945, Jones was taking part in offensive operations between Bonn and Cologne when a German bomb landed near him and he sustained head wounds that required him to be hospitalized. Jones remained on active duty as a major general until he retired for medical reasons in October 1945. Post-World War II After retiring, Jones lived in Washington, DC.

She is Professor in the department of archaeology and a member of the Centre for Medieval Studies at the University of York. Biography =Education and career= Born in Walsall, Hadley studied Modern History at the Universities of Hull and Birmingham. She was a temporary lecturer in History at the University of Leeds. In 1996, Hadley was hired by the University of Sheffield as a lecturer. From 2009 to 2018, Hadley was a Professor at the University. She served as Faculty Director of Post-Graduate Studies from 2009 to 2013. She was promoted to Head of Department in 2014. She also was Acting Vice-President for Arts and Humanities at the University from 2017 to 2018. Hadley joined the University of York in 2018. She has written several publications on Anglo-Saxon culture and society and Viking-Age history. Her primary research focus is the study of childhood, gender, migration, and funerary rituals. Hadley is Director of White Rose College of Arts and Humanities, Universities of Leeds, Sheffield, and York. =Current research= Hadley's most recent research includes contributions to The Rothwell Charnel Chapel Project, the Sheffield Castle project and Tents to Towns: the Viking Great Army and its Legacy project. Hadley, along with Dr Jennifer Crangle and Dr Elizabeth Craig-Atkins (University of Sheffield), led the Rothwell Charnel Chapel Project‚Äô, which focuses on the 13th century charnel chapel at Holy Trinity Church, in Rothwell, Northamptonshire. The below-ground chapel house contains one of two remaining medieval ossuaries in England. Tents to Towns, a four year extension of an earlier research project conducted by Dr. Julian Richards from 2011-2018, on the 9th century Viking winter camp at Torksey, Lincolnshire, continued under the leadership of Richards and Hadley. Building on the late Mark Blackburn's identification and characterisation of the site, the new project focused on the legacy of the Viking army in the area, its interaction with the local community, the development of Anglo-Saxon fortified settlements, and the changing nature of commerce during the Anglo-Saxon period at Torksey. Hadley has contributed to a new book led by Prof. John Moreland (University of Sheffield) on Sheffield Castle, which was destroyed (slighted) during the English Civil War. The book is based on the research project led by Moreland and Dr Gareth Dean on previous excavations of the castle site. Media From 1998 to 2010, Hadley appeared on five episodes of the British TV series, Time Team. She also appeared as herself in the TV Movie Documentary, Saxon Hoard: A Golden Discovery in 2012.

It is endemic to Kalimantan, Borneo (Indonesia), and known from its type locality in the Bukit Baka Bukit Raya National Park, as well as the Gunung Penrissen Nature Reserve, both in the West Kalimantan province, and from the Meratus Protected Forest in the South Kalimantan province. The specific name rajae refers to the type locality: Bukit Raya is the highest mountain in Kalimantan, getting its name from the Indonesian word raya (or raja), signifying the majestic size of the peak. It also alludes to the relatively large size of this species relative to its (then) congeners. Description Adult females reach in snout‚Äìvent length. The overall appearance is stocky. The snout is rounded. The head is slightly wider than it is long. The tympanum is not externally visible, with tympanic annulus being hidden under skin and covered with muscle. A distinct supratympanic fold is nevertheless present. The limbs are short. The fingers have narrow fringes and wide, truncated and flattened tips (discs). The toes are essentially fully webbed and bear similar discs as the fingers. Skin is granular. Dorsal coloration is uniformly light to dark brown or blackish, without any specific markings. The hind limbs have three indistinct darker crossbars. There are few, scattered white spots on the sides of body and head, the lower parts of the flanks, as well as on the hands and limbs. All digits have a white crossbar straddling middle of the truncated, flat disk. The iris is dark brown with indistinct reticulation. Habitat and conservation Alcalus rajae occurs in primary undisturbed and secondary forests near seepage areas close to small and slow-moving streams and swamps. Its altitudinal range is . Its morphology (fully webbed toes and absence of tympanic annulus) suggests that it is aquatic. It is probably an egg-laying species. This species occurs in the well-protected Bukit Baka-Bukit Raya National Park, but habitat loss is occurring outside the reserve. Meratus Protected Forest also has intact forest remaining. In contrast, most of the original vegetation in the Gunung Penrissen Nature Reserve has been lost because of slash-and-burn activities and tourism and recreational development. Outside the known sites, the species would be likely suffering from deforestation caused by oil palm plantations and forestry concessions.

Life  Born in Breslau, Reichwein was court Kapellmeister of the Badische Staatskapelle Karlsruhe from 1909 to 1913. In 1913 he succeeded Bruno Walter as conductor of the Vienna Court Opera. With Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler he was concert director of the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde in Vienna from 1921 to 1927. From 1926 to 1938 he conducted the Bochumer Symphoniker. Under his direction, the modern compositions of Paul Hindemith, Ernst Krenek, Erwin Schulhoff and Anton Webern, which had been cultivated by this orchestra until then, took a back seat to the repertoire in favour of classical-romantic music. When in 1932 he published the article Die Juden in der deutschen Musik in the party newspaper of the NSDAP V√∂lkischer Beobachter, which was based on Richard Wagner's anti-Semitic pamphlet Das Judenthum in der Musik, he drew the wrath of the Bochum citizens, who were still willing to resist.Annkatrin Dahm: Der Topos der Juden : Studien zur Geschichte des Antisemitismus im deutschsprachigen Musikschrifttum. G√∂ttingen : Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht 2007, Reichwein was a convinced Nazi and belonged to the NSDAP as early as 1932 (number 1.009.765) and the v√∂lkisch minded, anti-Semitic Kampfbund f√ºr deutsche Kultur .Fred K. Prieberg: Handbuch Deutsche Musiker 1933-1945, CD- Rom-Lexikon, Kiel 2004, p. 5.653-5.654. He published among other things heated tirades in the V√∂lkischer Beobachter against Jewish composers such as Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, who he primarily accused of financial interests as the driving force of their artistic creation. After the seizure of power by the Nazis he was a member of the Reichsmusikkammer. On 20 April 1938 Hitler appointed him Generalmusikdirektor. After the invasion and Anschluss of Austria he propagated the call for a \\"referendum\\" with the following words: \\"Since Adolf Hitler has reconquered freedom for us German artists in Austria, it is our deepest need to prove our gratitude by confession and deed.\\"Fred K.

Description Beginning at the tripoint with Burkina Faso, the border proceeds in an irregular line eastwards, cutting across the Niger river, with a series of straight lines proceeding eastwards to a point just north of the Mata Lekya well in Niger. The boundary then follows the seasonal Ahzar Amachkalo river in a steep north-eastwards direction, then continues in this manner via a series of straight lines in an almost directly northwards direction up to the Algerian tripoint. The terrain is generally Sahelian, merging into the Sahara desert in the northern stretches. History The border first emerged during the Scramble for Africa, a period of intense competition between European powers in the later 19th century for territory and influence in Africa. The process culminated in the Berlin Conference of 1884, in which the European nations concerned agreed upon their respective territorial claims and the rules of engagements going forward. As a result of this France gained control of the upper valley of the Niger River (roughly equivalent to the areas of modern Mali and Niger). France began occupying the area of modern Mali (then often referred to as French Sudan) during the 1880s-90s, later occupying the territory of modern Niger by 1900. These areas fell under the control of the federal colony of French West Africa (Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise, abbreviated AOF).Decree 7 September 1911, rattachant le territoire militaire du Niger au gouvernement g√©n√©ral de l'Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise, published in the Official Journal of the French Republic on 12 Septembre 1911 (Online) The internal divisions of this polity underwent several changes during its existence; what are now Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso were at first united as Upper Senegal and Niger, with Niger being classed as a military territory, ruled from Zinder. What is now the Mali‚ÄìNiger border was initially delimited by the Commanders of Gao and Niamey on 26 August 1909. It appears that for about year from 1910-11 the town of Gao was included within Niger. The Niger military territory was split off from Upper Senegal and Niger in 1911, becoming a separate colony in 1922. The Mali-Niger boundary was further delimited in 1928-29 and 1937‚Äì38, being finalised at a convention in Niamey on 3 April 1939. As the movement for decolonisation grew in the post-Second World War era, France gradually granted more political rights and representation for its African territories, culminating in the granting of broad internal autonomy to each colony in 1958 within the framework of the French Community. Eventually, in August 1960, both Mali (at that point part of the short-lived Federation of Mali with Senegal) and Niger were granted full independence and their mutual frontier became an international one between two independent states. A joint protocol between the two new states on 27 February 1962 confirmed their mutual boundary as per the 1939 convention. Security along the boundary has been poor for many years, owing to the Tuareg rebellions of the 1990s and 2000s. This worsened considerably after 2012, following the outbreak of the Northern Mali conflict and associated Islamist-inspired violence.Pentagon says fourth U.S. soldier killed in Niger ambush, Reuters, 6 October 2017.

Biography  Marguerite Bieber was born October 19, 1891 in Dearborn, MI. She began her undergraduate studies at the University of Michigan, where she was an undergraduate from 1910 to 1911, leaving school at her mother's death. She married Roy Carl Hicks, an accountant, in 1915. They had two children. When she was in her 40s, Hicks returned to university, now at Wayne State University, to complete a B.A. in English in 1935. She continued her research with an M.A. from Wayne State in 1938. Her M.A. thesis was titled A Survey of the English Women Writers 1652-1700. This research prompted her to begin collecting books by and about women from the period, an unusual choice since this was before many scholars considered Early Modern women writers worthy of study. Hicks was unable to complete a Ph.D. due to her failing eyesight. Roy Carl Hicks died in 1942. Some time in the late 1930s or early 1940s, Marguerite began a relationship with Thelma James, a folklorist from Wayne State University, who would be her long-term partner. Hicks and James collected rare books together throughout the 1940s and 1950s. In 1971, Hicks sold her collection of rare books to Oakland University‚Äôs Kresge Library. James' collection of folklore materials is also now held at Kresge library. Hicks died on May 9, 1978. = Thelma James = Thelma Grey James (1898-1988) was a professor in the English Department at the Wayne State University from the 1920s until 1963. She had a B.A. and an M.A. from the University of Michigan and specialized in folklore. She helped found the WSU Folklore Archive in 1939, which is now the largest and oldest collection of urban folklore in the U.S. James and Hicks had certainly met by 1937, indicated by one of the books in Hicks' collection bearing the inscription \\"To Marguerite with much love, Thelma. M. A. Wayne University, June 17th, 1937.\\" Due to Hicks' increasing blindness, James handled most of Hicks' correspondence, beginning as early as 1938. The society pages of the Detroit News called James and Hicks ‚Äúgreat good friends‚Äù and ‚Äúinseparable off-the-campus companions.‚Äù James never married, and shared a household with Hicks for 40 years, from when Hicks was widowed up until Hicks's death.

The original design was called XF30L20,000 which envisioned a diameter liquid fueled missile with a thrust engine and was ventured in the summer of 1944. The WAC Corporal sounding rocket was developed in 1945, providing experience with liquid fueled ballistic rocketry. The second phase gave experience with a redesigned and refined rocket and engine the following year. What was learned was applied to the Corporal program. Creating the Corporal E The major development problems that were to be encountered with the XF30L20,000 were guidance and the increased size of the rockets engine. The original time schedule was excessively optimistic especially as it envisioned the development of a turbo pump for propellants. The biggest problem was guidance as it was essentially unbroken ground. To provide as much data as possible a telemetry system was required. It was determined that an autopilot guidance system was required and that a means of radio guidance to control roll, pitch and yaw, would also be needed. Graphic mapping of the missile‚Äôs flight would be performed by two radar plotting boards. The guidance system of the first few rounds of Corporal E were to be supplied by Sperry Gyroscope Company largely from existing units because of the time required to develop special units. Primary control was to be via vanes extending into the rocket exhaust. Ten channels of telemetry were envisioned to be displayed on graphic recorders to provide data to the missile operators. It was the intent of the people conducting the program to have the capability to control the rocket‚Äôs flight with a control stick to observe flight characteristics. The intent was following the first few flights to have the operator hit a predetermined target. At the end of WWII the Corporal E programs adjusted to a less ambitious schedule and the WAC Corporal program was adjusted to provide more experience and design information. Work on the Corporal F with turbo pump instead of compressed air pressure propellant feed was halted with few parts produced.and the Corporal G study of a chemical gas generator to pressurize the fuel tanks was terminated as well.The Rockets and Missiles of WHITE SANDS PROVING GROUNDS 1945-1958, by Gregory P. Kennedy, p 118, Schiffer Military History, Atglen, PA, 2009 The Corporal E was designed by JPL, with the first 4 airframes built by Douglas Aircraft Company, rocket motors and telemetry equipment were produced by JPL, Sperry Gyroscope provided the autopilot, Army Ordinance the Doppler and Position transponder, and the Signal Corps the radar tracking beacon. Testing the Corporal E The first of the three pre- production missiles was fired at White Sands Proving Ground on 22 May 1947 with satisfactory results with a range of and an altitude of . The second Corporal E was a failure on 17 July 1947. The third Corporal E was a partial success on 4 November 1947. Thrust ceased after 43 seconds and an altitude of and range of were achieved. Telemetry reveals fluctuations in amplitude and frequency of pressure in the motor chamber. As a results of the first three flights the Army Ordinance Department decided to use the Corporal E as a means of developing the means of enlarging its experience in manufacturing guided missiles. There was also interest in developing the basic design to improve performance and reliability. To achieve these goals a further seven rockets were contracted for. Improving the Corporal E involved drastic changes in the rocket motor, airframe, guide vanes and control system. The design was changed to a more easily produced, assembled, and accessible structure. The means of launching was changed from the rocket sitting upon its fins to being held by four arms holding it above the fins which would retract to release it. The first of the redesigned Corporal E missiles was available in May 1949. Corporal E number 4 was launched on 7 June 1949 and was a failure due to guidance failure. It was determined that the guidance system was unreliable. It was determined that the guidance system being developed for the Sergeant missile was sufficiently developed to be used so it replaced the Corporal E‚Äôs system. It was also determined that the revised airframe had allowed damage to the control system. Considerable changes in the program were being promoted in Washington with Ordinance Department pushing for the development of a guided missile as a weapon. There was pressure to develop a missile for service by 1954. Corporal was further along than he competing GE Hermes program and was thus selected to develop a weapon, not just an experimental vehicle. The Corporal E launch program restarted with Corporal E number 5 on 11 July 1950 ,which was partially successful, as was Corporal E number 6. Changes were made in the control system, and it achieved reliable service. Changes in the fuel system also improved reliability. Corporal E number 7 introduced the quick shutoff valve to increase accuracy and the 19 cell air tank. Rockets 8 and 9 both showed failures in range both under and over. Electronics failure due to vibration was suspected and addressed. Corporal E 10 was not fired and number 11 which flew on 11 October 1951 was essentially the basic configuration of the Corporal ballistic missile the Army wanted including the new fin configuration. The Corporal E number 11 went off course towards Las Cruces. Corporal E number 5 had marked the effective end of Corporal E test vehicle development as the Corporal E had been selected for development into a guided missile weapon. The Corporal had been a most flexible program developing from WAC Corporal A and B to the early Corporal E to the limited production Corporal E. There was even a study done as to using the Corporal E in an anti- aircraft role. The Corporal Project proceeded with the development of the MGM-5 Corporal.} Notes References Further reading *Army Ballistic Missile Agency (1961) Development of the Corporal: the embryo of the army missile program Vol 1.

Facts The claimant, Ms Quashie, worked as a lap dancer for 18 months at two clubs owned by the appellant. She paid a fee to work at the club, and was classed as an independent contractor in the club owner's handbook. Ms Quashie was paid directly by patrons, with prices set out by the club for various dance packages. She was paid in 'heavenly money', which was a type of voucher patrons bought from the club. At the end of a shift, she would exchange these for a payment from the club. The club would make various deductions from this to pay for the facilities. They could also make deductions for things such as being late for a shift, or being off rota. Ms Quashie brought a claim for unfair dismissal, after being dismissed because of involvement with drugs. The issue was whether she came under the definition of \\"employee\\" under section 230 of the Employment Rights Act 1996. While her contract defined her as an independent contractor, she always felt as though she was treated as an employee. Judgement The Employment Tribunal decided that Ms Quashie was not an employee because there was no wage-work bargain between her and the club, as she was paid directly by patrons. In addition to this, she had not met the continuous period of employment. Ms Quashie appealed. Her appeal was accepted by the Employment Appeals Tribunal. The EAT took a broader understanding of the wage-work bargain, believing it to occur when an establishment provides something in exchange for work. The opportunity to work at the club was enough to satisfy this requirement. The EAT considered that since the club also had significant control over her, and she completed the work for them personally, Ms Quashie was an employee of the club. The club owners appealed this. The Court of Appeal allowed this, overturning the EAT's decision. They recognised that the club did have a significant degree of control, but it was not enough to say there was a contract of employment. For instance, she had a great deal of control over her appearance. The Court of Appeal accepted there was some mutuality of obligation too. However, this was only for a few nights a week, with nothing preventing her from working at other clubs on her nights off. As such, they concluded that there was no contract of employment, and Ms Quashie could have no claim of unfair dismissal.

Description The border starts at the tripoint with Mali in the north, and then proceeds in a generally south-eastwards direction (save for a small Burkinabe protrusion) following a series of predominantly straight lines, as well as some rivers such as the Tapoa, before reaching the Beninese tripoint on the M√©krou River. History The 1880s saw an intense competition between the European powers for territories in Africa, a process known as the Scramble for Africa. The process culminated in the Berlin Conference of 1884, in which the European nations concerned agreed upon their respective territorial claims and the rules of engagements going forward. As a result of this France gained control of the upper valley of the Niger River (roughly equivalent to the areas of modern Mali and Niger). France began occupying the area of modern Mali (then often referred to as French Sudan) and Burkina Faso (then called Upper Volta) during the 1880s-90s, later occupying the territory of modern Niger by 1900. These areas came the control of the federal colony of French West Africa (Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise, abbreviated AOF).Decree 7 September 1911, rattachant le territoire militaire du Niger au gouvernement g√©n√©ral de l'Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise, published in the Official Journal of the French Republic on 12 Septembre 1911 (Online) The internal divisions of this polity underwent several changes during its existence; what are now Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso were initially united as Upper Senegal and Niger, with Niger constituting a military territory ruled from Zinder. The Niger military territory was split off in 1911, becoming a separate colony in 1922, and Mali and Upper Volta were constituted as separate colonies in 1919. Prior to 1926-27 the Niger-Upper Volta border was formed entirely by the Niger river, however in that period by French decree Niger gained the areas west of the river which it holds today. A more precise border between the two entities was delimited in 1927. In 1932 Upper Volta was abolished, with its territory parcelled out amongst the surrounding colonies; as a result Niger gained much of the eastern areas of Upper Volta, giving it a common border with the French colonies of Togo and the Ivory Coast. Upper Volta was reinstituted in 1947 within its previous borders. French West Africa, during the period when Burkina Faso was split out between surrounding colonies As the movement for decolonisation grew in the post-Second World War era, France gradually granted more political rights and representation for its African territories, culminating in the granting of broad internal autonomy to each colony in 1958 within the framework of the French Community. In August 1960 both Niger and Upper Volta (renamed Burkina Faso in 1984) gained full independence, and their mutual frontier became an international one between two sovereign states. On 23 June 1964 the two new governments met and formally agreed to settle their shared border, however it appears no final arrangement came out of these discussions A full border demarcation remained incomplete until the late 1980s, however disputes about the interpretation of colonial- era boundary treaties prompted the two states to submit the dispute to the International Court of Justice in 2010. The ICJ subsequently ruled on the dispute in 2013, recommending some small territorial exchanges, which were accepted by both governments.

In the game, players assume the role of the titular robot in order to defeat enemies across multiple stages. The title is notable for being created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Orca and Crux before both companies declared bankruptcy, after which a group of employees from the two gaming divisions would go on to form Toaplan as a result, as well as being one of the few titles by Toaplan that has not received any official port to home consoles.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Performan is an action game where the players control the on-screen protagonist from a top-down perspective, where the main objective on each screen is to eliminate enemies in order to progress further, while an intermission animation plays between some stages.Performan arcade flyer (Data East, JP) Getting hit by an enemy will result in losing a live and once all lives are lost, the game is over unless the players insert more credits into the arcade machine to continue playing. The player controls the robot with a four-way joystick and two buttons to attack and dig. Players can dive into the ground to avoid enemies that can also perform the same action to chase the player character. Players can also attack enemies by throwing boomerangs, which can trigger the \\"meca-stones\\" placed on the playfield to explode and eliminating any enemy caught within its blast radius. Players can also trigger the meca-stones under the ground to eliminate enemies as well. Eliminating many enemies at once with an exploding meca-stone grants a determined number of points, which is also crucial for reaching high scores, though players can be paralyzed if the robot is caught with its blast radius. Meca-stones can also be pushed against enemies. After exploding a meca-stone, a gift item is spawned and after picking up the last gift before completing a stage, a \\"P\\" icon appears at the center of the playfield that turns into a colored ball. Collecting four colored balls in a row grants an extra live. After blowing up a meca-stone with enemies nearby, a ghost appears and after catching it, turns the players invincible for a brief time period to defeat enemies.  Development and release  Performan was created by most of the same team that previously worked on several projects at Orca and Crux before both companies declared bankruptcy, after which a group of employees from the two gaming divisions would go on to form Toaplan and among them were composers Masahiro Yuge and Tatsuya Uemura, both of which recounted the project's development process and history between 1990 and 2012 through Japanese publications such as Gamest and Shooting Gameside. (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Gamengai. ). (Translation by Gamengai. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ). Both Yuge and Uemura stated that the game was designed by Kenichi Takano and that their development environment at the time of the title's creation was done in the bedroom of an apartment. Uemura worked on the sound design for the game while he still formed part of Crux developing Repulse, however Yuge later assumed the sound design duties after Uemura had a motorcycle accident during development, in addition to programming as well. Performan was released only in arcades across Japan by Data East on April 1985. Uemura stated that the reason why the company was not credited for the title was due to contractual arrangements with Data East.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed it on their 1 June 1985 issue as being the twenty- second most-successful table arcade unit of the year. Nick Zverloff of Hardcore Gaming 101 gave positive remarks to Performan in regards to the graphics, music and gameplay but criticized several aspects.

The protected land covers an area of with an elevation range between and . The forest is best known for its namesake giant sequoia grove, Mountain Home Grove, which is home to some of the largest giant sequoias in the world.  History  Genesis, the 7th largest giant sequoia in the world. The forests of Mountain Home were used by local Native Americans in the summer to camp, hunt, and gather food. An interpretive exhibit at Sunset Point leads visitors through an archaeological site with evidence of occupation dating back 8,000 years. European settlers first arrived in the Mountain Home area in the early 1860s. The local forestry industry boomed following the construction of the first sawmills. Sheep and other livestock were also brought to graze upon the many grassy meadows of the forest. The forest was also a popular retreat for the people of Central Valley. Many small summer cabins were built and the forest saw about 600-700 annual visitors. In 1886, Andrew and Sarah Doty founded the small resort community of Mountain Home, drawing more visitors to the forest. By the 1890s, the local forestry industry began to wane. In 1907, the Central California Redwood Company sold the largest tract of land to the Hume-Bennett Lumber Company. Shortly thereafter the Hume-Bennett Lumber Company declared bankruptcy and the land was once again up for sale. There were no takers and so the land lay commercially dormant and open to visitors without restriction. In 1930, Donald Sutch bought the rights to log the forest deadfall of the land once owned by Hume-Bennett. Sutch worked the land until 1941, when efforts to sell the property began anew. The Michigan Trust Company owned the property at the time. Jack Brattin, the company‚Äôs executive who handled the property, had determined the land was no longer commercially viable to log, so he offered all 4,800 acres for sale to the U.S. Forest Service - only to be turned down. Undeterred, Brattin decided to create a compelling reason for a public agency to buy it. He authorized Dude Sutch and two commercial lumber companies to start felling live sequoia trees. This caused public outcry and forced the U.S. Forest Service and the State of California to negotiate the purchase of the land. The Native Sons and Daughters of the Golden West was especially outspoken about the need to preserve the giant sequoias of Mountain Home. In 1946, the State of California purchased the land and established the Mountain Home Demonstration State Forest, the first California State Forest. It was also the first demonstration forest meant for scientific research and experimentation in sustainable forestry and the restoration of the local ecology. The forest was heavily impacted by the Pier Fire in 2017.

In 1923, at 15, Nicker crossed the Tanami Desert solo and, in 1932 and 1933 he guided the expeditions of Michael Terry through the Gibson Desert.  Early life  Nicker was the son of Elizabeth and Sam Nicker who arrived at the Arltunga goldfields in the Northern Territory in 1903, after a two-year journey through the centre, by which time the output of gold had already diminished. This disappointed the two and, rather than mine Sam purchased a wagon from a \\"disgruntled quitter\\" and delivered water to the miners whilst Elizabeth started a market garden and herded feral goats for milk, meat and useful skins. By 1908, when Nicker was born, the family had moved, a little north of Arltunga, to establish what would become The Garden station which would provide produce, on a larger scale the Elizabeth's market garden, to the Arltunga and Winnecke Depot goldfields. In 1914 they uprooted again when Sam purchased the lease on Ryan's Well, near Aileron, where the family operated a cattle station and supplemented their income by operating the well for travelling stock and operating as a post and telegraph office. It was at Ryan's Well, which the family called Glen Maggie, that Nicker developed a relationship with the passing Afghan Cameleers and one of them, Sadiq, gifted Nicker with an orphaned camel calf and he spent a lot of time training the camel and exploring the station.  Explorations  In 1923 Joe Brown, an explorer and prospector, came through Ryan's Well on his way to cross the Tanami Desert and 15 year old Nicker convinced his parents to let him go with him. Nicker was unable to take his camels, as they didn't get along with Brown's horses and, instead, he took two station horses with him. Brown is described as an argumentative and difficult man and at Halls Creek the two parted company leaving Nicker to travel alone back to Ryan's Well. This was a very dangerous journey, in which many had died, at any time but was especially so in 1923 with the desert in the midst of severe drought and many wells in disuse. In his book The Last Explorer Michael Terry says: Following his return from this expedition in 1924 Nicker continued to explore in order to take in points of interest he had heard about and to make his own discoveries. He was helped in his explorations my his language skills as he could fluently speak a number of local languages including Luritja, Pitjantjatjara, Ngaanyatjarra and Pintupi. In 1928 Nicker met Terry for the first time and \\"the stage was set for a mutual admiration which would last a life time\\". Nicker served as Terry's guide, alongside Aboriginal cameleers, on his 1932 and 1933 expeditions which, under his influence, used camels only. These expeditions became the subject of Terry's book Sun and Sand (1937).  World War II  In 1939 Nicker volunteered to enlist into World War II where, after a brief time at the Colchester Barracks, approximately from London, he met a local girl named Jane whom he married by special licence after a month of courtship. The couple were only able to spend six weeks together. Following this he was first sent to the Middle East before being sent to Greece where he died on 19 April 1941.

It was released in August 1994 as the first single from his album Deep Thoughts from a Shallow Mind. It peaked at number 55 in the United States.. Content \\"State Fair\\" is a mid-tempo ballad. The narrator reminisces about an event in 1973, where him and his second cousin Calvin are heading to the state fair. On the way, they get involved in a head-on drunk- driving collision that claimed Calvin's life. The narrator survives and explains his guilt over the crash years later and talks about how he remembers his final moments with Calvin on the road trip, reaching underneath the dash and pulling out a pack of cigarettes he kept stashed. Controversy The song caused controversy by MADD advocates due to its portrayal of underage drinking, after a couple scenes in the video show two teenagers standing outside a convenience store getting an adult to purchase alcohol for them and one of the teenagers throwing an empty beer can into a farmer's field. Supernaw stated the video was never intended to glorify underage drinking, rather use the song's video as a message to talk about the consequences of it. Music video The music video was directed by Sherman Halsey. The video tells the story of the narrator and his second cousin, Calvin as teenagers in 1973. Calvin picks him up at his home and they stop at a convenience store where they ask an older man to purchase beer for them. The man does and they part ways. The teens stop and drink the beers and smoke cigarettes in a farmer's field. The pair then were in an off-camera head-on collision in which the narrator survives. The video flashes forward to the present day, where Supernaw and his friends are stopped at a service station on the way to a Houston Astros game. On the way inside, Supernaw sees two teenagers standing outside the store, he goes to approach them before reconsidering and walking into the store ignoring them.

Description The border consists of three straight lines proceeding northeast between the tripoints with Mali and Libya. The westernmost line runs from the Malian tripoint to the Agadez-Tamanrasset highway for ; the middle section run for up to the vicinity of I-n-Azaoua; and the final and longest segment runs for up to the Libyan tripoint. The boundary runs entirely within the Sahara desert. History The 1880s saw an intense competition between the European powers for territories in Africa, a process known as the Scramble for Africa. The process culminated in the Berlin Conference of 1884, in which the European nations concerned agreed upon their respective territorial claims and the rules of engagements going forward. As a result of this France gained control of the upper valley of the Niger River (roughly equivalent to the areas of modern Mali and Niger). France had already conquered most of northern Algeria during the period 1830-47, incorporating it as an integral part of France. France occupied the area of modern Niger in 1900, declaring it a military territory, ruled originally from Zinder. Niger was originally included, along with modern Mali and Burkina Faso, within the Upper Senegal and Niger colony, however it was split off in 1911 and became a constituent of the federal colony of French West Africa (Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise, abbreviated AOF).Decree 7 September 1911, rattachant le territoire militaire du Niger au gouvernement g√©n√©ral de l'Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise, published in the Official Journal of the French Republic on 12 Septembre 1911 (Online) In the meantime in Algeria France had been pushing south from the littoral region, conquering much of the Algerian Sahara in 1902. A boundary between French West Africa and French Algeria (i.e. what are now Algeria‚Äôs borders with Mauritania, Mali and Niger) was agreed on 7 June 1905 by the Commandant of Upper Senegal and Niger and the Military Commander of the Department de l'Oasis within French Algeria. The border was further defined by the Niamey Convention of June 1909. As the movement for decolonisation grew in the post- Second World War era, France gradually granted more political rights and representation for their sub-Saharan African colonies, culminating in the granting of broad internal autonomy to French West Africa in 1958 within the framework of the French Community. Eventually, in August 1960, Niger was granted full independence. The situation in Algeria proved much less clear- cut, owing to the large community of French settlers in Algeria, and independence was only granted in July 1962 after a long and bloody war. At that point the Algeria‚ÄìNiger border became an international frontier between two sovereign states. In recent years the border region has gained renewed focus, due to increasing numbers of African migrants crossing it seeking to reach Europe; in 2017 Algeria began policing the border more thoroughly, gaining some criticism as deported migrants were stranded at the remote frontier with no provisions.

She was elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2019.  Early life and education  Neuzil studied zoology at the University of Maryland, College Park and graduated summa cum laude in 1983. She was a medical student at Johns Hopkins University, where she was a member of Alpha Omega Alpha. She completed her residency at Vanderbilt University, where she specialised in internal medicine in 1987. She was made a Fellow in infectious disease at Vanderbilt University in 1991. After completing her fellowship, Neuzil started a Master of public health and graduated in 1998.  Research and career  Neuzil works on vaccine development and policy. After her fellowship Neuzil joined the University of Washington School of Medicine, where she served as Director of PATH's Influenza Vaccine Development Project. PATH is a Seattle-based nonprofit global health organisation, where Neuzil worked on the rotavirus, human papillomavirus infection (HPV) and Japanese encephalitis vaccines. In 2008 Neuzil partnered with Lentigen Corporation to research the pandemic influenza vaccine. Their early work considered the development of Influenza A virus subtype H1N1 and H5N1 virus-like particle pandemic influenza vaccines. Virus-like particle vaccines offer immunogenic, strain-specific recombinant antigens that can be produced at scale. In 2008 Neuzil was made Chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America Pandemic Influenza Task Force. In 2015 Neuzil joined the University of Maryland School of Medicine. At the Center for Vaccine Development Neuzil has developed and deployed vaccines to protect against a range of diseases including typhoid fever, shigellosis, malaria and cholera. She has also considered emerging pathogens such as the Zika and Ebola viruses. The Center is also part of the Typhoid Vaccine Acceleration Consortium (TyVAC), a collaboration between the Oxford Vaccine Group, University of Maryland School of Medicine Center for Vaccine Development. The typhoid conjugate vaccine created by TyVAC was demonstrated as a cost- effective strategy to protect people in low- and middle-income countries from typhoid. In 2018 phase 2 clinical trials began on the Influenza A virus subtype H7N9 vaccine. In 2019 Neuzil and the Center for Vaccine Development at the University of Maryland School of Medicine announced a seven-year $200 million contract with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The research program will test seasonal influenza vaccines and will feature clinical trials with populations including pregnant women, children and the elderly. She has spoken about the need for the public to have an influenza vaccine (flu shot), ideally by the end of October. Alongside her academic positions, Neuzil serves on the World Health Organization Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) and previously on the advisory group of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). = Awards and honours = Her awards and honours include; * 2016 Vanderbilt University School of Medicine Distinguished Alumni award * 2018 Top 100 Women in Maryland * 2019 Elected to the National Academy of Medicine  Selected publications   * * Neuzil serves on the editorial board of Vaccine: X and npj Vaccine.

Description The border starts in the west at the Algerian tripoint, just to the north of the Salvador Passage. It then proceeds in south-easterly directions, curving further to the south down to Tumu, whereupon it veers sharply to the north-east up to the Chadian tripoint. The borders runs through a remote stretch of the Sahara desert. History The 1880s saw an intense competition between European powers for territories in Africa, a process known as the Scramble for Africa. The process culminated in the Berlin Conference of 1884, in which the European nations concerned agreed upon their respective territorial claims and the rules of engagements going forward. As a result of this France gained control the upper valley of the Niger River (roughly equivalent to the areas of modern Mali and Niger). France occupied this area in 1900, declaring it the military territory of Niger, ruled originally from Zinder. Niger was originally included, along with modern Mali and Burkina Faso, within the Upper Senegal and Niger colony, however it was split off in 1911 and became a constituent territory of the federal colony of French West Africa (Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise, abbreviated AOF).Decree 7 September 1911, rattachant le territoire militaire du Niger au gouvernement g√©n√©ral de l'Afrique occidentale fran√ßaise, published in the Official Journal of the French Republic on 12 Septembre 1911 (Online) Italy meanwhile, which desired territory in the area of modern Libya, sought to emulate the colonial expansion of the other European powers, and they indicated their recognition of the above line to France on 1 November 1902. The Ottoman Empire had ruled the coastal areas of what is today Libya since the 16th century, organised into the Vilayet of Tripolitania, with an ill-defined border in the south. In September 1911 Italy invaded Tripolitania, and the Treaty of Ouchy was signed the following year by which the Ottomans formally ceded sovereignty of the area over to Italy.Treaty of Peace Between Italy and Turkey The American Journal of International Law, Vol. 7, No. 1, Supplement: Official Documents (Jan., 1913), pp. 58‚Äì62 The Italians organised the newly conquered region into the colonies of Italian Cyrenaica and Italian Tripolitania, and gradually began pushing the limits of the territories to the south; later, in 1934, they united the two territories as Italian Libya. France and Italy delimited the border between French Algeria and Italian Libya in 1919, which also covered the segment of the modern Libya‚ÄìNiger border as far south as Tumu. The precise details of the delimitation of the section east from Tumu to the Chad tripoint remains somewhat hazy, however the convention line as currently in place appears to have been agreed upon at some time in this period. The Libya-Niger was formerly longer than it is currently, prior to the transfer on 18 March 1931 of the Tibesti Mountains from Niger to Chad. During the North African Campaign of the Second World War Italy was defeated and its African colonies were occupied by the Allied powers, with Libya split into British and French zones of occupation. Libya was later granted full independence on 2 December 1951. A Franco-Libyan treaty was signed on 1 August 1955 which recognised the existing boundary. Niger later gained independence from France on 3 August 1960 and the border became an international frontier between two independent states. In recent years the border region has gained renewed focus, due to increasing numbers of African migrants crossing it seeking to reach Europe. France has started to assist in policing the border in recent years given the insecurity there, from the Madama army base in northern Niger, south of the Libyan border.

Sketch of Proof  gives the following proof of the inequality, based on the validity of Serre's multiplicity conjectures for formal power series ring over a complete discrete valuation ring. By replacing A by the localization at \\\\mathfrak r, we assume (A, \\\\mathfrak r) is a local ring. Then the inequality is equivalent to the following inequality: for finite A-modules M, N such that M \\\\otimes_A N has finite length, :\\\\dim_A M + \\\\dim_A N \\\\le \\\\dim A where \\\\dim_A M = \\\\dim(A/\\\\operatorname{Ann}_A(M)) = the dimension of the support of M and similar for \\\\dim_A N.

It continues to this day as a ceremonial organisation. Known as Leith High Constables, the organisation is now an honorary society, supporting the City of Edinburgh Council and the Monarchy. The Leith High Constables continue in their own society with selected members, convened by a moderator for ceremonial attendance at events, raising charitable donations through annual dinners and other fundraising. There is a specific formal dress code including top-hats, tails, waistcoats and ceremonial batons, and more recently formal dress specified for women High Constables, similar to those of the other High Constables of Scotland, in Edinburgh and in Perth. The official blazon (coat of arms) of the Leith High Constabulary was not awarded until 2014, by the Court of the Lord Lyon, and includes the coat of arms of Leith itself and the Leith motto 'PERSEVERE'.  Purpose  Modern view of King's Wark, Port of Leith High Constables were first appointed in 1611, by the magistrates of the ancient Royal Port of Leith, similar to the Edinburgh High Constables were set up as a group to act together to uphold regulations on cleanliness and orderliness, keeping the peace, law and order. Being based in the port, the 50 High Constables here were also expected to stop any pirates or smugglers. High Constables had powers to arrest anyone outside after the night curfew, or found carrying weapons. Prior to a formal police service, Constables were expected to take control during any rioting, disorder, or in cases of bloodshed or even murder, on the streets within their jurisdiction. High Constables were selected and appointed by the baillies and later the Lord Provost. Sometimes, like in 1657, High Constables had to arrest people for breach of the Sabbath - in that case, the Leith bailiies 'bickering'. = Guard of Honour = George IV landing at Leith, 1822 On the occasion of George IV's arrival at the start of first royal visit by the reigning Monarch, in two centuries, ably choreographed by Sir Walter Scott in 1822, the Leith High Constables paraded when King George IV arrived at Leith Harbour. A large ceremonial portrayal of the occasion, was commissioned from Alexander Carse and was hung in the old Leith City Chambers, now occupied by the Leith branch of Police Scotland. Leith High Constables were guard of honour along Leith Links during the later visit of Queen Victoria in 1842, when their contribution was praised to the Monarch by the Lord Provost: 'In consequence of the universal feeling of satisfaction and joy, which pervaded all classes, aided by the excellent arrangements of the High Constables and Moderators, the utmost regularity and good order prevailed;' The High Constables would also attend with the Lord Provost at Remembrance Day wreath laying and services, and the annual Festival Parade. = Batons = The use of the Leith High Constables ceremonial batons (being under 100 years old) was raised with Knife Crime Consultation Unit of the Scottish Executive, in July 2005, re The Criminal Justice Act 1988 (Offensive Weapons)(Scotland) Order 2005 Paragraph l(q) of the Schedule, by the High Constables of Edinburgh requesting an amendment of the law to permit their use in the streets of the city.Letter from Leonard Wallace ex Moderator High Constables of Edinburgh to Knife Crime Consultation Unit 08 July 2005 = Social events = As well as an annual dinner, there was a long standing annual excursion sometimes 'in concert' with the High Constables of Edinburgh for example, in 1859 on a visit to Melrose and in 1861 going to the Falls of Clyde.  Members and office bearers (past and present)  In 1907-8 the Leith High Constables Office bearers were: Moderator John Herdman, Vice-Moderator John Inglis, Treasurer James Galloway, Chaplain John T. Ramage, Custodier Charles Sanderson, Surgeon O.H. Garland, M.D., FRCPE, Secretary George. P. Gallloway, S.S.C., 33 Bernard Street, Leith In 1972, a former Moderator of Leith High Constables, Andrew Dick Wood published a history of the organisation up to the 1960s. In 1975, John Bottomley became both the Swedish Consul and a High Constable of Leith. In 1988, the Leith High Constables were photographed being inspected by Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh as they lined Leith Docks, during a Royal Visit. In 2004, the Edinburgh High Constables (including those from Leith) escorted Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II from the City Chambers, down the Royal Mile High Street in the parade for the opening of the Scottish Parliament. In 2019-2020 the Leith High Constables Officer bearers and members, had their annual dinner on the Royal Yacht Britannia , the annual dinner continued in 2020, members and guests will next year mark 410 years of an honourable tradition.  Further information about Leith Police  The history of the Port of Leith and the City of Edinburgh developed separately with Leith becoming a Burgh in 1833, and then, despite local opposition, amalgamating with Edinburgh in 1920. The High Constables were collaborating to resolve criminal and civil disorderly behaviour in the streets of the capital or the nearby burgh of Leith, and the in-between areas, for some two hundred years before the establishment of the current statutory Police Services. The Burgh of Leith Police was founded in 1859, and has a challenging tongue twister associated with it, 'the Leith Police dismisseth us' appropriately used as a test for sobriety not only in Leith, but as far afield as Australia, as described for example, for use when blood tests could not be taken in 1937.

Kan studied at Tsuda University, where she met Naoto Kan. She went on to study at Waseda University so that she could stay in Tokyo with Naoto, and graduated in 1970. They married that winter. However, because they are first cousins, the engagement was met with parental opposition. Kan campaigned for Naoto while raising their sons, Gentaro and Shinjiro. She would go door to door to talk to people and answer questions for housewives. She also made speeches and has a reputation as an excellent public speaker. When magazines spread rumors of Naoto having an affair with a television announcer, Kan famously scolded him for letting his guard down, the brushed the incident off. During Naoto's time as the Prime Minister of Japan, did not want to be called the First Lady, saying that she is simply Naoto's wife. Kan also gained a reputation as a scold when she wrote a book that was surprisingly critical of her husband, talking not only about the occasionally lackluster delivery of his speeches, but also about his inability to cook and lack of fashion sense. Its English title was \\"What on Earth Will Change in Japan After You Become Prime Minister?\\". Naoto has called her his toughest critic, and said that he has not read the book. The two regularly debate about politics and have opposing viewpoints on controversial issues like the death penalty.

Cavan. Abduction On the 17 September 2019, he drove into the laneway leading to his home and noticed a white car ahead of him, which quickly reversed into his car. He locked the doors but two men smashed the windows and dragged him out. A third man threatened him with a Stanley knife, telling him to get into the boot of a black Audi. The attackers then set Lunneys' car and the white car on fire. Lunney managed to unlock the boot and tried to escape but was beaten and thrown back into the car. He was then driven across the border to County Cavan to a place he described as \\"an old farmyard space\\" and taken inside a horsebox. The man with the knife said You know why you're here. It's about QIH and you're going to resign.' to which Kevin Lunney said \\"Yes\\". The man with the knife then ran the knife under each of Lunneys' nails, then the gang poured bleach over his hands and rubbed them roughly with a rag. They then cut his clothes off, leaving deep cuts, poured bleach on the cuts and rubbed them roughly with a rag. Kevin Lunney thought he was screaming, but didn't remember. The gang told Lunney they had watched him, his family and the other directors and if the directors did not resign the gang would come after them. The man with the knife also cut Lunneys' face five or six times on each side of his face and cut the letters \\"QIH\\" into Lunneys' chest. His leg was hit with a short fencepost or baseball bat - he heard it break. His leg was hit a second time, leaving it broken in two places. The gang said \\"We have to rough you up, we have to mark you, we have to make sure you remember.\\" He was dumped on the side of a road in County Cavan. He feared he was going to die as he was cold, in excruciating pain and losing blood. He was found by a man driving a tractor saw him on the side of the road around 21:00 BST and called the Garda√≠. Reactions Se√°n Quinn has condemned the violence. In an interview with Channel 4 News Se√°n Quinn said that he no longer wanted to regain control of his former businesses. Father Oliver O'Reilly, the parish priest of Ballyconnell in County Cavan, condemned the attack, said that a mafia-style campaign has shrouded the community in fear. The Association of Catholic Priests praised Father O'Reilly for his stance against attacks on the executives. In November 2019 it emerged that Se√°n Quinn had written a letter to senior figures in the Vatican as well as the Papal Nuncio to Ireland Jude Thaddeus Okolo to complain about a homily by Father O'Reilly. In the letter, Mr. Quinn denied having any \\"hand, act or part\\" in the attack on Kevin Lunney and that his family had been \\"frightened and intimidated by being falsely accused of complicity in the attack from the altar in public, by my own priest\\". The homily did not name anybody but referred to a \\"paymaster\\" which Quinn wrote is \\"clear and false reference\\" to him. The letter was also sent to Father O'Reilly and to Monsignor Liam Kelly, who administers the Kilmore diocese. Mr. Quinn met the Monsignor of the Diocese of Kilmore and also called to Father O'Reillys' home to discuss the matter. Police investigations Members of both an Garda S√≠och√°na and PSNI are investigating the attack. In November 2019, Cyril McGuinness, chief suspect in the kidnapping, died in a police raid on his home in Buxton, Derbyshire. The cause of death was reported to be a heart attack and the death is being investigated by Independent Office for Police Conduct. =Raids and arrests= On 8 November 2019 Cyril McGuinness died after taking ill during a police raid on a house in Buxton, Derbyshire. He was a known criminal and smuggler. The cause of death was reported to be a heart attack and the death is being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. On the morning of 14 November 2019 a woman, her son and an unrelated male were arrested in relation to the kidnap. The woman was held under section 30 of the Offences against the State Acts 1939 while the men were detained under the Criminal Justice Act 2007. The mother and son are thought to be related to someone involved in the kidnapping and the other man is thought to have supplied a vehicle. They were being held in Garda stations in Kells, Cavan and Monaghan. They were released and a file sent to the DPP On the morning of 26 November 2019 four men appeared in district court in Virginia, County Cavan and were charged with the assault and false imprisonment of Kevin Lunney. They were Luke O'Reilly of Kilcogy, County Cavan, Alan O'Brien and Darren Redmond - both of East Wall,Dublin and a fourth man who cannot be named for legal reasons. Luke O'Reilly and the fourth man were remanded to custody. Bail applications were made on behalf of Alan O‚ÄôBrien and Darren Redmond - Garda√≠ objected on several grounds including those relating to evidence and witness intimidation. Judge Denis McLoughlin refused both applications and all four were remanded to Castlerea Prison. On 28 April 2020 the High Court granted bail to Luke O'Reilly and Darren Richmond against Garda objections. The two men had been served with books of evidence on 26 March 2020 and they appeared on video link from Portlaoise Prison. The judge said that the crime they were charged with constituted vicious cruel and abhorrent behaviour but the prosecution had just failed to provide enough evidence to meet the standard for the court to refuse bail. The judge granted bail, but emphasised that stringent conditions were attached. O'Reilly was required to enter his own bond of ‚Ç¨75,000 with a cash bond of ‚Ç¨10,000 and that he should not attempt to dissipate or lessen the value of property owned by him. He is also to surrender his passport and not apply for any duplicate passport or travel documents. He must reside at an alternative address in County Westmeath, sign on at Athlone Garda Station twice daily, obey a curfew between 8am and 8pm, provide his mobile phone number to Garda√≠, keep the phone charged at all times and not come within 10km of Kevin Lunny's home or place of business. He was also not to have any contact with Kevin Lunney or any other prosecution witness, not leave the jurisdiction or travel to Northern Ireland. Redmon was granted bail on his own bond of ‚Ç¨3,000 and two independent sureties of ‚Ç¨10,000. He must reside at his address in East Wall, Dublin and sign on at Store Street Garda station twice daily and obey a curfew. The condition regarding dissipation of assets do not apply to him. The accused must make no contact between themselves and if it was necessary for them to be in contact they must contact Garda√≠. The requirement to sign on in Garda stations is suspended during the COVID-19 restrictions. The case is in for mention at the Special Criminal Court on 10 June 2020. On 10 June 2020 the date for the trial of the four men was set to begin on 21 January 2021 in the Special Criminal Court. Prosecution told the judge that the case involves 50,000 documents. O'Reilly and Redmond had their bail extended until January while O'Brien and the man who cannot be named were remanded in custody. On 14 August the man who cannot be named brought a High Court challenge against the Special Criminal Court's jurisdiction to hear his trial. He claims that the DPP's decision that he should not be tried before a jury is a significant curtailment of his constitutional rights.

In 2010, 8,753 people lived in the district. Geography The Northern District occupies an area roughly corresponding to the northern third of Jackson County. To the north, it is bounded by Harris and Steele Districts in Wood County, to the east by the Southwest District of Wirt County, to the southeast by District I in Roane County, to the south by the Eastern and Western Districts of Jackson County, and to the west by the Ohio River; across the river are Lebanon and Olive Townships in Meigs County, Ohio.United States Geological Survey, Topographical Maps, West Virginia‚ÄìOhio, Belleville Quadrangle (ed.

Most of the district is hilly, with a soil predominantly composed of various clays. There are fertile bottomlands, characterized by sandy soils, along the Ohio River and the larger creeks, particularly the areas around Muses Bottom and the city of Ravenswood.\\"Grant District\\" and \\"Ravenswood District\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County, West Virginia, H.H. Hardesty & Co., New York, Toledo, and Chicago (1883). The district includes Buffington Island, a large island in the Ohio River above Ravenswood. =Streams= The main streams of the Northern District all flow west or northwest, and empty into the Ohio River. Little Pond Creek flows through the northern end of the district, and enters Wood County, where it joins Pond Creek before meeting the Ohio just north of the county line. Little Sandy Creek flows into the Ohio River above Ravenswood. Sandy Creek drains the center of the district with its various tributaries, including the Lockhart Fork, Nesselroad Run, Turkey Fork, Right Fork, Trace Fork, and Straight Fork, meeting the Ohio at Ravenswood. =Communities= The only incorporated town in the district is the city of Ravenswood. With a population estimated at 3,668 in 2018, it is the largest city in Jackson County.United States Census Bureau, \\"Population and Housing Unit Estimates\\", Ravenswood city, West Virginia (retrieved 2 Nov. 2019). The area of Ravenswood was originally surveyed and patented by George Washington before the Revolutionary War, and the town laid out by his heirs in 1836.\\"Ravenswood\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County. In addition to Ravenswood, there are numerous small unincorporated villages, spread throughout the district, mostly along the Ohio River and the various creeks. Communities located along the River include Lone Cedar, Neptune, Murraysville, Muses Bottom, Polk, Morgan, Skull Run, Portland Station, and Sherman. In the northern part of the district, Topins Grove and Willowdale are located on Little Pond Creek; Utica is on the Cabin Fork of Big Pond Creek, most of which is in Wood County; Low Gap is on Skull Run; and Cuba and Sherman are located along Little Sandy Creek. Villages along Sandy Creek and its tributaries in the Northern District include Crow Summit, Drift Run, Duncan, Garfield, Independence, Jones Crossing, Le Roy, Liverpool, Lockhart, McClain, Meadowdale, Medina, Murray, New Era, Odaville, Sandyville, Wilding, and Wiseburg; Nuzums, Silverton, and The Y are on the boundary between the Northern and Western Districts. =Roads and transportation= The main north- south routes in the Northern District are West Virginia Route 68, which runs along the Ohio River from Ravenswood to Parkersburg, and County Road 21, known locally as the Parkersburg Road, which passes through the district between Ripley and Parkersburg, passing through Sandyville in the Northern District. Interstate 77 travels through the center of the district between Ripley and Parkersburg, with exits at Silverton and Medina. The main east-west routes include U.S. Route 33, which crosses the Ohio River at Ravenswood, and continues through the district to Silverton; Old West Virginia Route 56, from Silverton to the Parkersburg Road south of Sandyville; and Liverpool Road, which runs from Sandyville to Liverpool, then enters Roane County, continuing to Reedy. A railroad follows the Ohio River through the district, running between Point Pleasant and Parkersburg. The line originally belonged to the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, and is now part of CSX. History Although George Washington and his associates surveyed and patented lands along the Ohio River at the modern site of Ravenswood in 1772, but the Revolution and threat of Indian warfare forestalled settlement of the area for the remainder of the eighteenth century. The first European settlers in Ravenswood District arrived in 1807, and settled at Muses Bottom. More settlers arrived over the next two decades, clearing land for agriculture, and building grist mills and sawmills along the creeks.\\"Grant District\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County.\\"Ravenswood District\\", in Hardesty's Biographical Atlas of Jackson County. Until 1831, the territory that would become Jackson County divided between Mason, Wood, and Kanawha Counties. Most of the Northern District was originally part of Wood County, but the site of Ravenswood was in Mason County. While there were settlers in the vicinity of Ravenswood, the town was not laid out until 1836, when the Washington heirs began to subdivide the land and sell it in parcels. After West Virginia was admitted to the Union in 1863, the counties were divided into civil townships, which were converted into magisterial districts in 1872. Jackson County was divided into five magisterial districts: Grant, Ravenswood, Ripley, Union, and Washington. Except for minor adjustments, the names and boundaries of the historic districts remained largely unchanged from the 1870s until the 1990s, when the county was redistricted in order to equalize the area and population of its magisterial districts as nearly as possible. All of Grant District was combined with most of Ravenswood District to form the Northern Magisterial District. The southwestern portion of Ravenswood District was added to the new Western Magisterial District, although the city of Ravenswood remained in the Northern District. The southeastern boundary of the Northern District follows the original boundary of Ravenswood District, while the southwestern boundary follows U.S. Route 35 and Old West Virginia 56 to The Y, then runs south along the Parkersburg Road until it meets the original line of Ravenswood District. Because redistricting proved confusing with county records, the West Virginia Legislature provided for the original magisterial districts to continue in the form of tax districts, which continued to serve administrative functions other than the apportionment of county officials.W. Va. Code ¬ß 11‚Äì3‚Äì1A. The current magisterial districts are used for those functions requiring equal representation between the residents of the various district, and as such are currently the minor civil division of record for the United States Census Bureau.

From 11 August to 12 November 1920 in Cork County Gaol, Peter, his elder brother John Crowley, and 10 others underwent a hunger strike of 94 days, demanding the reinstatement of their political status and release from prison. Their strike was in sympathy with that of the Lord Mayor of Cork, Terence MacSwiney, imprisoned in Brixton Gaol, who died there on hunger strike in 1920. He came from the prominent Irish republican Crowley family of Ballylanders, his brothers being the T.D. and Senator Tadhg Crowley and his fellow hunger striker John Crowley.  Early Life  Peter Crowley was born on 13 July 1900 in the village of Ballylanders, County Limerick, as the son of local draper and postmaster Timothy Crowley (1847 - 1921), who had fought in the Fenian Rising of 1867, and Ellen Ryan Crowley (1863 - 1951). He was the second youngest of eight siblings, all but one of whom were boys. He had a well-off childhood, with the Crowleys making much profit from their drapery, which is still an open shop in the village. Peter attended the local national school in Ballylanders.  Revolutionary Activities  Peter, along with all of his family except for his brother Patrick, who was studying to be a priest, played an active role in the Irish revolutionary period. Peter had already joined the Irish Volunteers by 1916, and so had the rest of the Crowley brothers. His sister, Bridget \\"Bridie\\" Crowley, later O'Donnell, was a member of Cumann na mBan from the age of 14. In the week starting with Sunday, 23 April 1916, and including the Easter Rising of the 24 to 29 April, Peter served with the Ballylanders Company under the command of William P. Hanahan. Through this period, Peter made ammunition and cut communications lines in preparation for attack on Royal Irish Constabulary (R.I.C.) barracks in the area and was mobilised for active service. He took part in ‚Äúlocal activities‚Äù under order of his commanding officers ‚Äúuntil arrival of countermanding orders‚Äù. Thereafter, he awaited further orders. In the periods comprising the 1 to 22 April 1916 and 30 April 1916 to 31 March 1917, Peter, again serving under William P. Hanahan up until his arrest and from then on Donnchadh Hannigan, carried out military orders and instructions from commanding officers. As a consequence of this, he was arrested by British forces at Ballylanders in July 1916 and detained in the Military Detention Barracks Cork for two weeks. Before and after his arrest, Peter took part in the making of ammunition, preparing for military service, drilling, and carrying despatches. Over the course of 1 April 1917 to 31 March 1918, Peter, now under Donnchadh Hannigan, carried out all orders and military instructions as ordered by his commanding officers. He took part in raids for arms, ammunition and equipment, which he then took care of and protected. Along with the some of his comrades, he took part in ‚Äúgeneral preparations and activities to resist Conscription by force of arms‚Äù. In Galbally, he was engaged in operations where members of the R.I.C. were injured in baton charges and the barracks was damaged by the Irish Volunteers. It was during this time that Peter was enrolled as a member of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (I.R.B) and took part in all Irish Volunteer associated activities. During the time from 1 April 1918 to 31 March 1919, and commanded by Sean T. Riordan, Peter ‚Äúcarried out all orders and military activities as ordered by officers in charge as a member of the Irish Volunteers. He made ammunition, and took part in training, drilling and general preparation for active service in connection with resisting conscription and any other service required of him. During that period activities were stalled owing to resistance to conscription and general elections. From 1 April 1919 to 31 March 1920, Peter, once more serving under Sean T. Riordan, carried out all orders from his commanding officers as both a member of the Irish Volunteers and as a member of the I.R.B. He was connected with activities associated with the ‚ÄúKnocklong Train Raid‚Äù, and he carried despatches, trained in the use of arms, which he also collected, and spent time parading and drilling, among other activities during this period. 1 April 1920 to 31 March 1921 was an extremely challenging time for Peter. It was during this period that he took part in a hunger strike that lasted 94 days ‚Äì a world record. Before his imprisonment, he carried out all orders and military instructions of his commanding officers and was imprisoned as a result of these activities. Peter, along with fellow rebels, attacked and destroyed Ballylanders R.I.C. Barracks. He was engaged with the attack on Kilmallock Barracks as well and took part in defending his father Timothy Crowley's house in Ballylanders when it was bombed by British forces on 6 July 1920. Peter took part in an ambush on the R.I.C. at Ballinahinch and on both the R.I.C and British military at Emly. He fought in the streets of Ballylanders on 16 July 1920, when he was captured and imprisoned by the British. He was tried by court martial on the charge of taking part in an attack with firearms on Crown forces and was sentenced to three years in prison, where he underwent what would become the longest hunger strike in history, lasting 94 days. It was during this time that, from 11 August to 12 November 1920 in Cork County Gaol, Peter, along with his brother John Crowley, Michael Fitzgerald, Joe Murphy, Thomas Donovan, Michael Burke, Michael O‚ÄôReilly, Christopher Upton, John Power, Joseph Kelly and Se√°n Hennessy, underwent a hunger strike of 94 days, demanding reinstatement of political status and release from prison. This hunger strike was held parallel with that of Lord Mayor of Cork, Terence MacSwiney, who died in October 1920 after his 74th day on hunger strike. Peter Crowley and the other strikers still hold the Guinness World Record for longest hunger strike, though the record is no longer included in editions of the book to prevent people from starving themselves for the record. From 1 April to 11 July 1921, Peter was imprisoned on Spike Island, in Cork Bay. He was under the command of Se√°n Toomey. In the prison, he and other prisoners destroyed military sheets, bedding and furniture. Over the time between 12 July 1921 to 30 June 1922, Peter, was working under his sister Bridie's often commander Patrick O‚ÄôDonnell. He was involved in no military engagements, and spent around ten days recovering in the Mater Hospital in Dublin from his hunger strike. In the second last time period from 1 July 1922 to 31 March 1923 and under Patrick O‚ÄôDonnell's command once more, Peter ‚Äúcarried out all orders of commanding officers in connection with general activities, training etc. up to capture by Irish Free State forces about 19th August 1922.‚Äù He was then held prisoner for two weeks in Mitchelstown Court House, after which he was released unconditionally due to his ill health. Outside of jail, he carried despatches in connection with military operation and engagements at Kilmallock. He took part in the destruction of Galbally Police Barracks and attacked Free State posts at Bruff and Rockbarton. From 1 April to 30 September 1923, Peter was unable to render any active service due to his ill health and was medically advised to leave the country. He sailed for America on 15 April 1923. In 1932, Peter applied for a military service pension under the Army Pensions Act 1932. However, nothing came of this due to his difficulties in getting to necessary medical certificate to prove his treatment in the Mater Hospital. On his 1935 pension application, he wrote that he was receiving a weekly salary of ¬£2, 8 shillings and 7 pence as a paper keeper in the Department of Industry and Commerce. This sum included the cost of living expenses.Military Service Pension Application of Peter William Crowley, 1935  Life After the War  By the outbreak of the Civil War, Peter, having been medically advised to leave Ireland, was living in the Bronx, New York, and working as a ticket agent for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company. He met his future wife, Minnie Daly (1906 - 1991) at a S√≠b√≠n that her aunt owned during Prohibition. They married in 1928, and their first son, Peter Maurice Crowley, was born in New York in December 1929. Peter, believing that the \\"foot soldiers\\" of the war would be rewarded under the new Fianna F√°il government, returned to Ireland against the wishes of his wife Minnie, who wanted to stay in New York. He lived with his brothers in Ballylanders for about three months, and later moved to Collins Avenue, Dublin. Another son, Tadhg Crowley, was born to them in 1934. Peter would spend the rest of his working life in the civil service.  Death  Peter William Crowley died from lung cancer on 8 April 1963 in his home on Collins Avenue.

It contains well-preserved mechanical engineering devices in a Richardsonian Romanesque building. During its busiest years, the waterworks pumped as much as a hundred million gallons of water each day. The station was decommissioned in the 1970s, and later some of its buildings were turned into condominiums. After a period of disuse, the pumping station was restored, and in 2007 the Waterworks Preservation Trust was set up to oversee its conversion into a museum. In March 2011, the building reopened to the public as the Waterworks Museum.  History  The pumping station‚Äôs Leavitt and Worthington Engines In the 1850s, Boston began modernizing its water supply, which at the time was a combination of wells, pond water, and downhill piping from a Natick reservoir. In the 1870s, Boston city leaders decided the city needed to scale up its water filtration and pumping and began looking into options. In 1886, this 'high service' pumping station was designed, and the next year it came online as the Chestnut Hill pumping station - only a few years after the first such station in the world, in Germany. Water was pumped from this station uphill to the Fisher Hill reservoir, where gravity would then push the water to the surrounding area. In 1894, the station put its third water pump into operation: a steam-powered water pump designed by Erasmus Darwin Leavitt. The Leavitt-Riedler Pumping Engine, as it was later called, was promoted as \\"the most efficient pumping engine in the world\\" it was first unveiled, and remained in operation through 1928. In the 20th century it was declared a historic mechanical engineering landmark by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. It was fully restored by the museum and is the centerpiece of its main floor. = Trivia = Mark Wahlberg filmed part of his 1992 \\"You Gotta Believe\\" in the basement of the building.

He has taught classes in woodworking at the LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired's Enchanted Hills Camp in Napa County, California and owns a furniture studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, with a new shop set to open in 2019 in Greeneville, Tennessee. Biography Born in 1954 in Traverse City, Michigan, George Wurtzel lost his eyesight at a young age due to hereditary retinitis pigmentosa. He attended the Michigan School for the Blind at the same time as blind musician Stevie Wonder, for whom he later carved a one-third scale concert piano replica as an achievement award. At age 19 he started his woodworking career. He owned a successful furniture business in Michigan, where his projects included the renovation of the historic Traverse City courthouse, for which he built a new set of doors. When the business encountered financial difficulty he relocated to North Carolina in 1982, where he studied furniture production management at Catawba Valley Community College. Wurtzel returned to Michigan, serving as executive director of Opportunities Unlimited for the Blind, a non-profit organization which focuses on building life skills and independence for blind and low-vision children. Through OUB, Wurtzel operated a camp for blind children, which won the 2009 Dr. Jacob Bolotin Award for \\"outstanding programs serving blind people.\\" Wurtzel moved to Minnesota in 2009, opening a furniture store in South Minneapolis. In 2014, his work was included in the Museum of Contemporary Art in Detroit. In 2018 he announced the acquisition of space for a new workspace and gallery in Greeneville, Tennessee. Although he takes advice from sighted colleagues on the coloration of pieces of wood, Wurtzel identifies most of the characteristics of wood by feeling its texture, often using water or steam to enlarge the grain, and can identify different types of wood by smell. His artwork is known for the use of spalted wood, which has distinctive patterns of fungal growth that he identifies by touch and incorporates into his artwork. Wurtzel has been an instructor for the American Association of Woodturners, Blindness Learning in New Dimensions (BLIND), Woodworking for the Blind, and the Enchanted Hills Camp operated by LightHouse for the Blind and Visually Impaired. At Enchanted Hills, Wurtzel instructed visually impaired students on technical skills, artistic development, and the safe use of power tools including saws and lathes; he also founded the Tactile Art Center, a gallery for art which is designed to appeal to the sense of touch, also located at Enchanted Hills. In addition to woodworking, Wurtzel has worked as a bicycle and auto mechanic and trained Arabian horses for endurance riding. An accomplished cross-country skier, he competed for the U.S. Paralympic team in 1980, was on the first American expedition to ski across Lapland, and helped bring the 1980 Ski for Light event to his hometown of Traverse City, Michigan. In 2018, he was featured in a televised advertising campaign for Subaru in which he is shown leading a group of travelers through the wilderness, something he has been known to do for visitors to Enchanted Hills.

By 1997, the War Museum housed two of her paintings of Kyle Brown and later accepted her MacKenzie and Dallaire portraits. In 2003, Kearns was one of the chosen artists sent to Afghanistan under the Canadian Forces Artists Program. Upon her return, Kearns completed a three-panel painting titled \\"What They Gave,\\" which included an image of three wounded men in hospital settings. In 2005, two of her art pieces depicting Canadian soldiers, specifically Kyle Brown, torturing Shidane Arone, were displayed at the Canadian War Museum. As a result, boycotts arose from Clifford Chadderton and National Council of Veterans Associations who did not want such contents on display. She also created an exhibition of painting regarding John Bentley Mays to display \\"psychological conflict and the transitory nature of resolution in the face of intellect and depression.\\" Kearns eventually compiled her Afghan war art into an exhibit titled \\"The Art of Command: Portraits and Posters from Canada's Afghan Mission.\\" From December 2005 until January 2006, Kearns was commissioned to stay with Canadian soldiers in Kandahar and create five paintings from that experience. In 2008, Kearns was commissioned to paint Tecumseh and Brock, the Shawnee Indian leader and British major-general who fought in the War of 1812. By 2011, Kearns was working on creating 24 war posters, specifically images of prominent Canadian soldiers. Despite the willingness of the Canadian military to accept her work, Kearns found that commercial galleries were unwilling to display her art for not being ‚Äúsubversive enough.‚Äù In 2015, the Fort York Visitor Centre displayed Kearns military art exhibit \\"The Art of Command: Portraits and Posters from Canada‚Äôs Afghan Mission.\\" In 2019, Kearns was named a Member of the Order of Canada.

He had lived for some time in Derrylin in County Fermanagh. He was 54 when he died. Early life and family He was originally from Cloughran in Swords, Dublin, Republic of Ireland. As a teenager he worked in scrap metal and was known to Garda√≠ by the time he was 20. He had a brother, Francis, who was estranged from him. His brother is an articulated truck and car dealer. Criminal history He was banned from driving for 25 years in 1986 and jailed for six months after refusing to stop for Garda√≠ as they pursued his lorry through north County Dublin in 1984. After his conviction he was led from Balbriggan courthouse while handcuffed to a Garda. He shouted \\"bastard\\" at a Garda sergeant who had testified against him and \\"violently spat\\" in the sergeants' face. Although he was described as a Republican, Garda√≠ believed that his real motivation was money and that he had no political beliefs. He did supply vehicles to the Provisional IRA and was heavily involved with paramilitaries in smuggling laundered fuel, alcohol and cigarettes, however. In 1986 he was also convicted of perjury after he asked another man to testify that McGuinness was a passenger - not the driver - in a lorry that was pursued by Garda√≠ in a separate chase. He was given a twelve-month suspended sentence for perjury. The Garda√≠ believed that in the 1980s he was seriously involved in handling stolen vehicles as well as smuggling them into Northern Ireland and Britain for resale. In 1992 he was arrested in Dublin Airport with four forged ‚Ç§20 notes. It took Garda√≠ three days to discover his real identity because he used up to 12 false identities at the time. Because he was uncooperative with Garda√≠ and had so many aliases he was remanded in custody for a month before pleading guilty to the charges in court. At the time of this conviction he had at least three addresses in north County Dublin and one in London, England. He managed to secure a number of waste disposal contracts from local authorities in his twenties despite having a criminal record. These contracts included those for the disposal of hazardous waste. He used those contracts to engage in fly tipping. Investigations by the Garda√≠ led to him moving first to County Monaghan, then to County Fermanagh. In 2004 the BBC Northern Ireland current affairs programme Spotlight exposed him as being involved in the illegal transportation of waste. In 2007, he pleaded guilty to 22 charges related to illegally transporting waste from the Republic of Ireland through Northern Ireland to Scotland and received a suspended sentence. There were a series of thefts of ATMs in Ireland around 2009 in which he and his gang were suspects. Twenty trucks and cranes were stolen in Belgium and the Netherlands and brought to Ireland. McGuinness was arrested in a Dublin court when he appeared in relation to charges of theft of an ATM. A European Arrest Warrant was issued for McGuinness in 2008 in which he was described as an active member of an Irish criminal organisation. In April 2008 he was stopped by Serbian police near the Croatian border. He was taken to Belgrade from where he was extradited to Bruges. While there, he was granted bail and left the country, though he was convicted when he was tried in absentia. He was sentenced to seven years imprisonment and was extradited back to Belgium in 2011 to serve his sentence. Death His death occurred after a police raid on his home in Fairfield, near Buxton, Derbyshire in November 2019. He was being investigated about the kidnapping of Kevin Lunney. The cause of death was reported to be a heart attack and the death is being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct. The IOPC have verified that police were executing a warrant at his residence at the time he took ill, though they have said there was no evidence a taser was used.

She is of Te Rarawa, Te Aup≈çuri and Ngati Rangitihi descent. As well as being a published poet, her work is included in the permanent collection of the Dowse Art Museum.  Background  Roma Potiki was born in Lower Hutt, a city in the Wellington Region, and grew up in the suburb Wainuiomata. As a child she attended Wainuiomata Primary School, Woodhatton Primary School, Wainuiomata College and Wellington High School. Her first play was written while at primary school and she also started writing poetry at school.  Career  Roma Potiki was involved in contemporary MƒÅori theatre in early formative years. She was in a play performed by Te Ika A Maui Players in 1978 called Death of the Land by Rore Hapipi's (Rowley Habib). She went on to help form the MƒÅori theatre company Maranga Mai in 1979. This company was linked to the MƒÅori protest movement and they toured a theatre production in 1979 - 1980 to marae and schools. In 1990 she was a founding director of another theatre company He Ara Hou. They performed and toured a play called Whatungarongaro. This play was directed by Potiki and John Anderson and devised over nine months with the company members. Potiki had previously done workshops with a theatre company PETA (Philippines Educational Theatre Association) and was influenced by their way of working. Roma Potiki's writing includes poetry contribution to many anthologies, as well as published volumes. She has written the forward to books of New Zealand MƒÅori plays and contributed text to exhibition catalogues. As a fine artist Potiki has exhibited art work and one of her pieces Hinewai is in the collection of the Dowse Art Museum.  Legacy  The poem Stones in her Mouth by Potiki inspired contemporary New Zealand choreographer Lemi Ponifasio to create a community leadership project also called Stones in her Mouth in 2013. This involved a group of MƒÅori women holding workshops at marae and writing text that was then performed. = He Ara Hou and Whatungarongaro = Before actor Rena Owen was in Once Were Warriors she performed a similar role in theatre company He Ara Hou's play Whatungarongaro that Potiki a co-creator of. Owens performance in Whatungarongaro influenced her being cast in Once Were Warriors. Playwright and director of theatre company Tawata Productions Hone Kouka cites seeing Whatungarongaro in 1991 at the Depot Theatre in Wellington as being life changing and convincing him that innovative MƒÅori theatre had no boundaries. Another New Zealand theatre and film writer Briar Grace-Smith was an assistant to Potiki and learnt from the process of making Whatungarongaro.

Personal life Dwight was born in Woolverstone, England circa 1601 and came to Massachusetts in 1635. He originally settled in Watertown, Massachusetts before becoming one of the original incorporators of Dedham, Massachusetts the following year. He brought his wife, Hannah, and children, including Timothy Dwight. He was married twice, first to Hannah, with whom he had five children: Hannah, Timothy, John, Mary, and Sarah. Hannah was named for her mother, and Timothy was possibly for a family member or for their minister, Timothy Dalton. Mary was born while at sea on their way to Massachusetts. After Hannah died on September 5, 1656, Dwight married Elizabeth Ripley on January 20, 1658. They did not have any children together, and she died on July 17, 1660 by drowning herself. Dwight died January 24, 1661. As a high ranking family man with strong religious convictions, Dwight was awarded 12 acres of land when he first settled in Dedham, the maximum allowed. As a selectman, he received large grants of land. As was typical of long serving selectmen, Dwight was comparatively well off. He was able to give his son a house and plot of land as a gift and yet still die with an estate valued at ¬£500. He was able to acquire the wealth due his high standing in the community, marked by service to the town and church. It made him one of the richest men in Dedham. His estate grew to be quite sizable by the time he died, giving his heirs more than they possibly could have imagined had the family remained in England. He passed on both his wealth and prestige to his son Timothy, marking the start of one of a family that was known for both and wealth and prestige. His brother, Timothy, traveled from England to Dedham shortly after Dwight. He lived in Dedham until 1650 when he became one of the first settlers of Medfield, Massachusetts and built the Dwight-Derby House. When Timothy moved to Medfield, Dwight purchased Timothy's most valuable lands to be ale to finance the move. Founder of Dedham Dwight was on the very first Board of Selectmen in Dedham. He served for 16 years with his final term ending in January 1653/54. He was \\"one of the highest ranked men\\" in the town. Dwight was one of just ten men, or 5% of the population, who made up 60% of the leadership of the town. Though service on the board was not always continuous, with men taking the occasional year or two off, they were always asked to contribute to important projects or committees during those times. He also served as tax surveyor, suyveyor of highways, fence viewer for East Street, and in a number of other positions. Tradition holds that either Dwight or John Rodgers, both signers of the petition seeking the establishment of the town, asked the Great and General Court to name to name the town Dedham--not Contentment, as was originally asked--after their hometown of Dedham, Essex. Career Dwight was a part owner of a mill on Mother Brook, the first man made canal in America. In 1642, John Elderkin, who built the mill, sold half of his rights to Nathaniel Whiting and the other half to John Allin, Nathan Aldis, and Dwight. They operated the mill \\"in a rather stormy partnership\\" until 1649 when Nathaniel Whiting became the sole owner. The Town was displeased with the \\"insufficient performance\\" of the mill under Whiting's management. In 1652, Whiting sold his mill and all his town rights to Dwight, Francis Chickering, Joshua Fisher, and John Morse for ¬£250, but purchased it back the following year.

Atrial cross () is called, in the Mexican Colonial Conventual constructions, the sculptures of crosses created by the mendicant friars in the atriums of the churches, symbolically pointing to the center of the towns given their arrangement between the longitudinal and transverse axis of the atrium. As Priest Arturo Schroeder Cordero cited in his article \\"The functions of the conventual atrium in the Mexican 16th century\\", the crosses were made in the beginning of wood and later in stone, since these functioned as lightning rods, as was the case of the huge atrial cross of the Convent of San Jos√© de los Naturales in Mexico City, which was split in two by a lightning in the early 16th century. The atrial crosses are usually placed on a pedestal or socle; they have only the face of Christ, a cartouche with the legend INRI on its top, the marking of the three nails in Christ's hands and feet and the carving of the symbols of the Passion, such as the nails, the hammer with which they nailed Jesus, a rooster singing on the column of the Passion, the cilice of the scourge, the crown of thorns and the dice with which his executioners played to circumvent the clothes of Christ, among others. The decoration is usually of the fitomorphic type, with huge flowers of lis and other floral details in which the carving is inspired by indigenous elements and by being many of them made from a single core stone. A good number of atrial crosses are currently preserved in the colonial Mexican churches and there are others that are replicas. It was sometimes used as reference points to measure distances between towns. File:Cruz atrial Tultitl√°n.JPGAtrial cross in Tultitl√°n de Mariano Escobedo, Mexico.

Players take on the role of medics to reach the location of Dizzies via an ambulance, with the ability to drive recklessly off ramps and through obstacles such as fences and walls. Once at the marked location, players can pick up Dizzies using a stretcher to carry them back to the ambulance and deliver them to the hospital. The game can be played in single-player, in which one player controls both paramedics, or in two-player co-op, where each player controls one of the medics. Players can unlock character costumes and furniture for the medics' home base by exploring the world map and mission areas. The comical style and co-operative gameplay of The Stretchers is reminiscent of that of the Overcooked! series, while the careless ambulance driving has been compared to the gameplay of Crazy Taxi.

It is now preserved at the Canadian Railway Museum. History The locomotive was an early Canadian Pacific diesel. Before it was delivered in November 1937, the railway had only used self- propelled rail motor cars. The unit was ordered in 1935 from Stone Franklin of Canada Ltd of Montreal but was built by National Steel Car in Hamilton, Ontario. It used a 6-cylinder, diesel prime-mover from Harland & Wolff of Belfast, Northern Ireland with electrical equipment by Laurence Scott and Electromotors of Norwich, England. CP 7000 was a double-truck, four-motored switching locomotive. It cost $89,500 when built. The locomotive worked at the Hochelaga Yard in Montreal until Alco S-2 units arrived at the Yard in 1943; it was then leased to Marathon Paper Mills Ltd., in Peninsula, (now Marathon) Ontario for a period of 3‚Äì4 months. It was finally purchased by the paper mill in October 1944. It operated for many years without a number until it was re-engined in 1951 with a 600-horsepower Caterpillar diesel engine.

It has smooth bark, egg-shaped to lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of between seven and fifteen, pale yellow flowers and cup-shaped to cylindrical fruit. It is thought to be a hybrid between E. cornuta and E. angulosa that occur in the same area. Description Eucalyptus √ó missilis is a mallee that typically grows to a height of and forms a lignotuber. It has smooth dull grey bark. Adult leaves are egg-shaped to lance-shaped, the same shade of glossy green on both sides, long and wide on a petiole long. The flower buds are arranged in leaf axils in groups of between seven and fifteen on a thick, unbranched peduncle long, the individual buds sessile or on pedicels up to long. Mature buds are spindle-shaped, long and wide with a blunt, conical operculum. The flowers are pale yellow and the fruit is a woody, cylindrical to cup-shaped capsule, long and wide with the valves at rim level. The characteristics of this mallee are intermediate between those of E. cornuta and E. angulosa but the authors, Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper consider \\"that the morphological uniformity of mature individuals within and between all populations justifies taxonomic recognition of the species.\\" It is usually found growing with both parent species. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus √ó missilis was first formally described in 2002 by Ian Brooker and Stephen Hopper in the journal Nuytsia from specimens collected from Cheyne Beach in 1983. The specific epithet (missilis) is a Latin word meaning \\"missile\\". The species is known as \\"bullet bush\\" because of the shaped of the flower buds. Distribution and habitat This mallee grows in sand over limestone or granite in coastal sites between West Cape Howe and Cape Le Grand. Conservation status This eucalypt is classified as \\"Priority Four\\" by the Government of Western Australia Department of Parks and Wildlife, meaning that is rare or near threatened.

In the 1980s he was linked to the Nuova Famiglia and according to investigators, he was involved in the murder of Giacomo Frattini, known as 'Bambulella', a young affiliate of the Nuova Camorra Organizzata of Raffaele Cutolo. Frattini was tortured, killed and torn to pieces in January 1982, to avenge the murder in prison of a loyalist of the then Secondigliano's flamboyant boss, Aniello La Monica. Bambulella was found wrapped in a sheet in the trunk of a car with a disfigured face, while his hands and heart were found closed in two plastic bags inside the car. In May 2014 was confirmed the life sentence for Cinquegranella and other Camorristi for the crime. In the 1980s, Cinquegranella was also accused of giving refuge in his villa in Castel Volturno to terrorists belonging to the Red Brigades.

He batted and threw left-handed. In an illustrious career, Enomoto was a 12-time All-Star, a 9-time Best Nine Award winner, and a Rookie of the Year winner, all achieved with the Mainichi/Daimai/Tokyo/Lotte Orions. He was inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 2016.  Early life  Born in Tokyo, Enomoto attended Waseda Vocational High School. Other alumnus of the school include Hiroshi Arakawa, Akihiko Ohya, Daisuke Araki and Japanese baseball legend Sadaharu Oh, who would pitch against Enomoto in the 1971 Japan Series.  Career  = Mainichi/Daimai/Tokyo/Lotte Orions = Enomoto in 1956 Straight out of high school, Enomoto started his career by winning the 1955 Pacific League Rookie of the Year Award. He was also an All-Star and led the league in walks. He came 10th in batting average, at .298. He set records for batters coming directly out of high school in runs, hits, doubles, walks and on-base percentage. The next year, Enomoto yet again led the league in walks and was also an All-Star. He also received his first Best Nine Award. Despite a slight decrease in stats, Enomoto still made the All-Star team in 1957. His stats decreased yet further in 1958, but he still made the All-Star team. 1958 marked the first time that he finished with more strikeouts than walks. His stats rose in 1959, playing in his fifth-straight all-star game and receiving his second Best Nine Award after hitting .276. In 1960, he played in an All- Star game and took home a Best Nine Award, but he also was a serious contender for the MVP Award after leading the league in batting average (.344), runs (94), hits (170), and doubles (37). His teammate, Kazuhiro Yamauchi, would win the title. Enomoto also went 3-for-15 in the 1960 Japan Series, as the Orions were swept by the Taiyo Whales. He would continue his form in 1961, hitting .331 (2nd in the league, behind Isao Harimoto) where he would make his 7th straight All-Star game and win his 3rd straight Best Nine Award. He hit 17 home runs in 1962, setting a personal record at that point. He led the league in hits with 160 as he was once again an All-Star and Best Nine Award selection. He would continue his All-Star and Best Nine streak through 1963 and 1964, leading the league in walks and hit by pitches in the latter year, before ending both of them in 1965, when he hit only .268, his lowest since 1958. He followed his subpar 1965 season with what could arguably be his best season, leading the league in hits (167), doubles (31), total bases (272), OBP (.434), slugging (.571), and average (.351). He took home the Best Nine and was an All-Star for the 11th time, but the MVP award went to Katsuya Nomura. 1967 marked the last time he would lead in any major category, with 83 walks. 1968 would be the last time he would be an All-Star (his 12th time) or a Best Nine selection (his 9th, a record). On July 21, 1968, Enomoto would get his 2,000th hit, doubling off of Hall of Famer Keishi Suzuki. Aged 31 years and 7 months, he was the youngest player ever to reach the mark and the 3rd all- time. He set more records, including setting a streak of 1,516 error-free chances from 1967-1968, and a .999 fielding percentage at first in 1968. In 1969, he hit .273, which would increase to .284 in 1970. His last year as an Orion, 1971, saw him bat .244 in just 45 games. The Orions lost the Japan Series to the Yomiuri Giants, leaving Enomoto without a Japan Series title. = Nishitestu Lions = Enomoto played his last professional season in 1972, with the Nishitetsu Lions, where he would hit .233 in 61 games. He finished his career with a .298 average, 2,222 games played, 1,169 runs, 2,314 hits, 409 doubles, 246 home runs, 979 RBI, 153 steals in 237 tries and 1,062 walks to 645 strikeouts in 7,763 AB and 9,002 plate appearances.  Post-baseball  Despite qualifying for the Meikyukai, Enomoto never participated in their activities and is not deemed a member. Hiromitsu Ochiai is the only other player to turn down membership. Following his retirement, he worked for a parking garage management company, where he wrote about baseball. He died of colon cancer in 2012 and was posthumously inducted into the Japanese Baseball Hall of Fame in 2016.

It is a dual carriageway for its entire length, with multiple sets of traffic lights. In addition to servicing the southeastern suburbs of Perth, the road provides a vital connection from the Perth CBD to Perth Airport, the Kewdale Freight Terminal and the Darling Scarp. It is designated H27 (Rivervale‚ÄìWattle Grove Link) in Main Roads' internal designation along with Welshpool Road East west of Tonkin Highway. Route description The entire length of Orrong Road is a four lane dual-carriageway, similar to other major roads in the area such as Albany Highway, Welshpool Road and Abernethy Road. Unlike those roads however, the carriageways of Orrong Road are separated by a wide tree-lined central median, giving the road more of a boulevard appearance. The western terminus of Orrong Road is located just to the southeast of the parclo interchange between Graham Farmer Freeway and Great Eastern Highway where the road transitions from a freeway to an at-grade dual carriageway. The road continues in a south-easterly direction forming the boundary between the Town of Victoria Park's Lathlain and the City of Belmont's Rivervale. The first traffic light intersection is encountered at Francisco Street. At Roberts Road the southern suburb boundary changes to Carlisle, with the northern suburb swapping to Kewdale just south of the signalised intersection with Archer Street (at the Sydenham Street cul-de- sac). The next signalised intersection, with Wright Street, connects Orrong Road to Belmont Forum. The final set of lights prior to Leach Highway is found at the intersection with Oats Street. At Briggs Street the southern suburb boundary changes to the City of Canning's Welshpool with the road now marking the northern limit of the Welshpool industrial area The road then intersects with Leach Highway at a diamond interchange with Leach Highway free-flowing over Orrong Road, after which the northern side also transitions from a residential to an industrial area. The next signalised intersection with Division and Bell Street sees the road fully enter Welshpool. Two more sets of lights are encountered at Pilbara Street and Kewdale Road. After Kewdale Road the road curves to the east and runs parallel with Welshpool Road to the south. The two roads eventually connect to each other via a signalised intersection with McDowell Street as a proxy for Welshpool Road. Orrong Road's eastern terminus is at the diamond interchange with Roe Highway. As with Leach Highway, Roe Highway is also free-flowing over Orrong Road, which continues as Welshpool Road East from this point. History Orrong Road was gazetted in 1937 from sections of roads at the time that were originally known as Hawkstone Street, Prospect Road, Burswood Avenue and Wickalls Avenue. The road was named after Orrong Road in Melbourne, itself an important road in Melbourne's inner south eastern suburbs. Since gazetting Orrong Road has underwent major changes, starting with conversion to dual carriageway in the latter half of the 20th Century. In 1997 the intersection with Great Eastern Highway was converted to an interchange in preparation for the connection to Graham Farmer Freeway. In 2002, before Roe Highway's extension, Orrong Road would terminate at Welshpool Road in the form of a T-junction. Orrong Road was extended to meet Roe Highway in the form of a diamond interchange and now continues as Welshpool Road East. In 2007 the Leach Highway intersection was converted to an interchange.

The first Indonesian ambassador to Spain was Boediardjo (1976‚Äì1979). The current ambassador, Hermono, was appointed by President Joko Widodo 20 February 2018.  History  Diplomatic relations between Indonesia and Spain were established in February 1976. Boediardjo, as the first Indonesian ambassador to Spain, presented his credentials to the King of Spain, Juan Carlos I, on 26 February 1976. In April of the same year, the staff of the diplomatic mission who initially used the Mel√≠a Castilla Hotel in Madrid as their offices moved to a building at Calle de L√≥pez de Hoyos 38. At that time, the mission included the ambassador and several diplomats who were responsible for matters of politics and economy, information and culture, communication, and administration, and a personal secretary to the head of mission. In addition, the mission hired several local employees. In 1979, the diplomatic mission moved to Calle de Cinca 18. Then in 1984, the offices moved to its present location at Calle de Emilio Vargas 7 (the official address is Calle de Agastia 65). The building that houses the chancery was designed by Miguel Fisac. In 1976, a villa located at Calle Monte Alto 40 in the Montecillo de Humera area of Madrid was rented and used as the official residence of Ambassador Boediardjo. In 1978, a different villa in the same street (Calle Monte Alto 44) was subsequently rented as the official residence of the ambassador, which was called Wisma Duta. The Indonesian government purchased this second villa in 1981.

The capilla posa is the architectural solution used in the monastery-ensembles of New Spain in the 16th century consisting of four vaulted quadrangular buildings located at the ends of the atrium outside them. Like the capilla abierta, religious figures were posed in it, so the name of it, is a unique solution and a contribution of the New Spain to universal art given its originality and the plastic and stylistic resources used in its ornamentation, with pre-Columbian and Baroque art elements. As paradigmatic examples are those of Huejotzingo and Calpan in Puebla, Mexico, which have an ornamental program made with tequitqui technique and based on medieval and Renaissance aesthetic canons, as a pure expression of syncretism. The Convent of San Miguel in Huejotzingo dedicated its chapels with advocacy to John the Baptist, James the Great, Our Lady of the Assumption and Saints Peter and Paul; they have a square base of 5.40 m on each side. The accesses to the plant are opened with reduced arches of linked mouldings, related to the decoration of the doorway del Convent and the representative cord of Francis of Assisi. There are several theories about its function. It has been proposed that, following the processional path, the capillas posas served to ‚Äúpose‚Äù or rest the Blessed Sacrament when it was taken out in procession through the atrium. Researcher Carlos Chanf√≥n has suggested a didactic function to house groups of students who were catechized, since one function of the atrium in these sets was the teaching not only of religion but of the norms and offices of Western life. It has also been proposed its use and relationship with the four neighborhoods that used to settle in the towns and cities following the typical Spanish pattern and of which each one was in charge in its cleaning and maintenance. According to Antonio Rubial, they were able to serve as burial mounds of indigenous rulers. Margarita Mart√≠nez del Sobral has proposed its use as hermitages for the temporary isolation of the friars. Its origin has also been proposed in various ways. Carlos Chanf√≥n has proposed his inspiration in the early churches and hermitages. According to the archaeological analysis of Mario C√≥rdova Tello, its construction was not always part of the original design, as evidenced in the engravings of the capilla posa in the former Franciscan Convent of Huejotzingo, whose construction corresponds to the third stage (1545‚Äì1580) with engravings mentioning the year 1550.

It was published on November 5, 2019, by Center Street, a division of Hachette Book Group. The book debuted at number one on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list. Summary The book is critical of political correctness, and argues that the American Left has a victimhood complex. In the book, Trump Jr. alleges that those identifying with the Left frequently employ a combination of victimization and bullying to advance their views. He suggests ways of defending one's (conservative) principles so as to not acquiesce to supposed Leftist intimidation and coercion. Specifically, Trump Jr. advances theories about how the intelligence community has attempted to harm President Trump, comparing President Trump's experiences with the FBI COINTELPRO harassment campaign which targeted civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Trump Jr. also writes about a visit to Arlington National Cemetery, stating that he got emotional looking at the graves and that the experience reminded him of \\"all the sacrifices\\" the Trump family had made, including \\"voluntarily giving up a huge chunk of our business and all international deals to avoid the appearance that we were 'profiting off of the office.'\\" Publication and promotion On May 22, 2019, it was announced that Trump Jr. signed a book deal with Center Street. The book's title, release date and cover were announced on July 22, 2019. Triggered was published on November 5, 2019 by Center Street, a division of Hachette Book Group. A book signing tour began on November 5, 2019 in Scottsdale, Arizona. In an October 2019 conference call, Trump Jr. unveiled a website titled \\"Trigger a Lib\\" where fans can purchase a copy of Triggered to be sent to a number of politicians, including Hillary Clinton, Nancy Pelosi, Adam Schiff, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar and Mitt Romney. =Book sales= The book quickly became a bestseller on Amazon. The book debuted at number one on the New York Times nonfiction bestseller list for the November 24, 2019 edition of The New York Times. The book's entry on the list included a dagger (‚Ä†) beside it, indicating \\"institutional, special interest, group or bulk purchases.\\" A week earlier, it was reported by Zeke Miller of the Associated Press that the Republican National Committee (RNC) was giving away signed copies of the book to donors, which helps to boost reported book sales. Upon its inclusion on The New York Times list, the Associated Press reported that a spokesman for the RNC indicated they bought copies of the book \\"to keep up with demand\\" and denied they purchased them in a \\"large bulk purchase.\\" Nicholas Confessore, a reporter for The New York Times, acquired a Federal Election Commission filing showing the RNC spent $94,800 to purchase copies of the book one week prior to its release and that they offered a signed copy to anyone donating at least $50 to Donald Trump's reelection campaign. The New York Times also discovered that at least nine other Republican organizations, candidates, and other organizations like Turning Point USA with ties to the Trump family had made bulk purchases of the book. According to CNN, Triggered would still have topped the Times's list without the RNC's purchase. =The View appearance= On November 7, 2019, Trump Jr. appeared with his girlfriend Kimberly Guilfoyle on the talk show The View. They appeared on the show's 5,000th episode to promote Triggered, seated alongside hosts Whoopi Goldberg, Abby Huntsman, Joy Behar, Meghan McCain and Sunny Hostin. The exchange devolved into \\"cross-talk\\" as the hosts grilled Trump Jr. with questions pertaining to the Trump‚ÄìUkraine scandal, including Huntsman asking Trump Jr. why he had posted the name of the supposed whistleblower to his Twitter. The discussion further fell into \\"chaos\\" when Trump Jr. accused Behar of wearing blackface and accused The Views network, ABC, of covering up for Jeffrey Epstein. Trump Jr. also accused Goldberg of defending film director and convicted rapist Roman Polanski. Poppy Noor of The Guardian wrote a piece about the episode suggesting Trump Jr. intended to \\"start a fight over political correctness\\" to create \\"perfectly predictable viral content\\" and wrote, \\"we need to stop making it so easy for [President Donald Trump] to get to us. His fans will be brimming with glee at his son‚Äôs performance.\\" Lorraine Ali, a television critic for the Los Angeles Times, described the episode as emblematic of \\"America's kitchen table\\" and said, \\"Sometimes, when you disagree about politics with your nearest and dearest, you just have to have it out.\\" Charlie Kirk, in an opinion published in Newsweek, defended Trump Jr. and called the hosts hypocritical. =UCLA event= On November 10, 2019, Trump Jr. appeared at a speaking event in Westwood, Los Angeles hosted by Turning Point USA to promote Triggered at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), seated alongside Kimberly Guilfoyle and Charlie Kirk in UCLA's Moore Hall. The event was attended by over 400 people and protested by dozens of planned demonstrations from Refuse Fascism, the Revolution Club UCLA, the Afrikan Student Union at UCLA and Young Democratic Socialists of America. Before the event, Turning Point announced that the questions and answers (Q&A;) segment of the speaking engagement was cancelled due to time constraints. Trump Jr. was greeted with chants of \\"USA\\". However, the event was marred by shouting and heckling from both protesters and supporters, which increased when it was mentioned that the Q&A; segment was cancelled. Trump Jr. argued that his answers to audience members could be taken out of context by the media and the Internet. The audience responded by chanting \\"Q and A\\" repeatedly in hopes of Trump Jr. and Guilfoyle answering questions but the two left the stage moments later. Parodies Satirical mashup of the slip cover at Barnes & Noble, New York City Triggered was mocked after its book cover became a meme online when Parker Molloy posted a blank template of the cover on Twitter, inviting others to fill in their own title and tagline. On November 7, 2019, comedians Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler replaced the slip covers at a Barnes & Noble in New York City, changing the book's title to \\"Daddy, Please Love Me: How Everything I Do Is Try to Earn My Father's Love\\". Full Frontal with Samantha Bee created a website titled \\"Trigger A Troll\\" in response to Trump Jr.'s \\"Trigger a Lib\\" website. The website uses an identical design to \\"Trigger a Lib\\" and allows individuals to make monetary donations under the name of Rudy Giuliani to the Government Accountability Project, Brett Kavanaugh to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network, Betsy DeVos to DonorsChoose, Stephen Miller to the American Civil Liberties Union, Mike Pence to The Trevor Project and Ted Cruz to Moms Demand Action. Reception The book received mixed reviews. Lloyd Green of The Guardian called the book \\"one- eyed, loose with the facts and a crude attack on the left,\\" having \\"little to say about the sentinels of the right, starting with his father.\\" He also wrote that Obama and Trump Jr.'s criticism of \\"the left's social justice warriors for their paroxysms of wokeness\\" are accurate, and that the book should be read \\"as the opening salvo of the Trump child with real political chops\\" and \\"a better campaign biography than most.\\" Ashley Feinberg of Slate panned the book, criticizing its \\"excruciatingly insecure prose\\" and writing that \\"parts may have genuinely been written by Don Jr. himself\\" since \\"some of the errors are so ludicrous they couldn't possibly have come from anyone else.\\" Feinberg described the examples of Trump Jr. citing a statistic from the anti- immigration organization Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) but confusing it with the progressive media watchdog Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR), and being duped by a student's satirical op-ed in the Yale Daily News. Publishers Weekly wrote that the book is aimed exclusively at Trump loyalists and that \\"Trump Jr. delivers the snarky yet polished self- portrait he's been honing at his father's rallies and on Twitter for years.\\" Reis Thebault of The Washington Post criticized Trump Jr. for hypocrisy in Triggered, writing, \\"In it, Trump Jr. writes, \\"A victimhood complex has taken root in the American left.\\" Yet, in his telling, the real victim is often him, his father or another Trump family member.\\" John Haltiwanger from Business Insider characterized the book as \\"a lengthy rant about how his family has been victimized by Trump's presidency\\". Washington Post book critic Carlos Lozada panned the book as both failing \\"as memoir and as polemic: Its analysis is facile, its hypocrisy relentless, its self-awareness marginal,\\" and its writing as \\"wretched, even by the standards of political vanity projects.\\" He called Trump a \\"second-generation dynastic hopeful\\" following in his father's footsteps with \\"familiar Trump put-downs, talking points, omissions and pats on the back\\" and by denouncing the news media.

Toru Hashimoto, one of the leaders of the Japan Innovation Party, expelled her after speaking with her about the matter. A few months later she was caught giving 800,000 yen in campaign funds to her father, who also served as her private secretary. In August 2015 she released an autobiography that included photographs of herself in suggestive poses. Uenishi tweeted a rude message at the Urawa Red Diamonds soccer team for losing a match in 2017. Urawa fans then responded to her, starting a Twitter argument that culminated in death threats being sent to her office. At a press conference on September 24, 2017 she announced that she would not run for office during the next election. In 2018 she decided to become a tarento, and was hired by a production company. She appeared on Mecha-Mecha Iketeru! and London Hearts.

It is the highest point of the Joffre Group, which is a subset range of the Coast Mountains. It is situated east of Pemberton, and northeast of Lillooet Lake. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Weart, to the southwest. The slopes of the mountain are covered by the Matier Glacier on the northwest, Anniversary Glacier on the northeast, Twin One Glacier on the southeast, and Hartzell Glacier to the south. Precipitation runoff from the peak drains into Joffre Creek and Twin One Creek, both tributaries of the Lillooet River. The first ascent of the mountain was made on August 18, 1957, by Dick Chambers, Joe Hutton, Roy Mason, Paddy Sherman, and Cyril Scott, who were members of the British Columbia Mountaineering Club. The mountain's name honors Tom Matier, an early well-known prospector in the area. Its name was officially adopted on April 21, 1966, by the Geographical Names Board of Canada. Climate Mt. Matier (left) and Joffre Peak Based on the K√∂ppen climate classification, Mount Matier is located in a subarctic climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel east toward the Coast Mountains where they are forced upward by the range (Orographic lift), causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall. As a result, the Coast Mountains experience high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. Temperatures can drop below ‚àí20 ¬∞C with wind chill factors below ‚àí30 ¬∞C. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for climbing Matier.

After crossing the Indochinese Peninsula, Severe Tropical Storm Matmo's remnants entered the Andaman Sea. It began to organize over the southern Bay of Bengal in the beginning of November, then it slowly intensified into a cyclonic storm as it moved north. In addition, it is only the second to make it to hurricane strength, the first being in 1960. Meteorological history On 28 October, a tropical depression formed near Palau, being named Matmo by the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) on 30 October. It quickly intensified into a severe tropical storm, packing winds up the 60 mph (95 km/h) as it approached the Vietnamese coast. A quick moving storm, it made landfall in Vietnam on the same day, bringing strong winds and heavy rain, causing moderate flooding and many road closures in the country. Not long after landfall in Vietnam, it weakened into a tropical depression, later degenerating into a remnant low as its low-level circulation dissipated. Severe Tropical Storm Matmo's remnant re-organizing over the Andaman Sea on November 4, 2019. On November 2, the remnants of Matmo emerged into the northern Andaman Sea. Meteorological agencies began to show interest in the system as it slowly began to reorganize and develop, with a new low-level circulation forming from it on November 4. It then fully reformed into a depression on November 5. Upon strengthening into a cyclonic storm, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) assigned the name Bulbul. It continued intensifying and increasing in speed for the next three days, however still slowly moving north and prompting the IMD to issue coastal warnings for Bangladesh and West Bengal of India and prohibit all fishermen activity, beach activity, and boating in and around the Bay of Bengal. About a day later, Bulbul made landfall near Sagar Island in West Bengal around 18:30 GMT on 9 November, killing at least two people and weakening back to a Severe Cyclonic Storm as it interacted with land and unleashed a high storm surge. Not too long after this land interaction, Bulbul rapidly weakened into a deep depression the next day as it began to move over Bangladesh, however still causing very heavy rains. Preparations =Bangladesh= Ahead of Bulbul's landfall, Bangladeshi officials ordered 2.1 million people to evacuate coastal areas. Due to the cyclone, all the JSC‚ÄìJDC examinations of 9, 11 and 12 November and National University examination of 9 November were suspended. Bangladesh Inland Water Transport Authority suspended all sorts of activities at three maritime ports and riverine transport services during the cyclone. All flights to and from Shah Amanat International Airport in Chittagong and Cox's Bazar, Barisal, Jashore domestic airports were cancelled for 14 hours owing to the inclement weather under the influence of the cyclone. Health department officials in these districts formed 1,599 teams to attend to those affected by the cyclone. Around 56,000 volunteers were deployed to conduct rescue and relief efforts while the military bases at the coastal districts remain on alert. All coastal infantries of the Bangladesh Army prepared to take immediate action to provide assistance during and post cyclonic destruction. The Bangladesh Navy and the Bangladesh Coast Guard prepared to undertake emergency rescue and relief operations with warships and vessels. Impact and aftermath =Bangladesh= Rajrajeshwar Char of Chandpur, Bangladesh affected by cyclone Bulbul The cyclone caused severe damage across coastal Bangladesh, resulting in the deaths of 25 people. In the Khulna District, 9,455 homes were destroyed and 37,820 were damaged. Across the Bagerhat District, 8,788 homes were destroyed and 35,779 were damaged. The nation's agriculture industry was severely affected, with of farmland‚Äîroughly 14 percent of the nation's total farmland‚Äîwas damaged. Approximately 72,000 metric tons of crops were lost, with a total value of Tk 2.63 billion (US$33 million). =India= Odisha In Odisha, the cyclone's outer bands produced heavy rain and squalls, causing agricultural damage, uprooting trees, and knocking down power lines. Although, as part of rescue, around 350 local villagers in the district of Balesore were taken to cyclone shelters as the storm neared. An estimated of crops were damaged statewide. Two people died in storm-related incidents. West Bengal Bulbul's landfall in West Bengal around the Sunderban Dhanchi forest brought extremely heavy rain and winds up to 135 km/h (85 mph) across much of the southern portion of the state. A 59-year-old man was killed after being electrocuted by a lamp post, and another was killed due to a collapsed wall. Before the cyclone even made landfall, however, a man was killed after a cedar tree branch fell on top of him. Fallen trees caused road blockages across the city of Kolkata as well, and members of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) removed these blockages. Operations at Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport in Kolkata were suspended for 12 hours.

Written before 1794, the author is unknown. The story is about So Daeseong, a generous poor man in China who wants to marry a rich woman named Chaebong. However, her family will not condone the match.. A dejected So Daeseong descends into gluttony and sleep for a long time. He eventually becomes a warrior monk and defeats an invading army. So Daeseong then becomes emperor and is able to marry Chaebong.  Introduction  There is an old Korean saying, used to tease someone who constantly sleeps: ‚ÄúJust like So Daeseong, all you ever do is sleep.‚Äù The ‚ÄúSo Daeseong‚Äù referred to in this adage is the main character of the story, So Daeseong.  Authorship  The author of this story is unknown. Oda Ikuguro (Â∞èÁî∞Âπæ‰∫îÈÉû, 1754-1831), a Japanese interpreter at the official interpreter‚Äôs office in Tsushima Island, recorded a list of Joseon novels in 1794 within the Sangseo gimun (Ë±°ËÉ•Ë®òËÅûDiplomats‚Äô Travelogue): ‚ÄúJangpungunjeon (ÂºµË±êÈõ≤ÂÇ≥ The Tale of Jang Pungun), Guunmong (‰πùÈõ≤Â§¢ The Cloud Dream of the Nine), Choehyeonjeon (Â¥îË≥¢ÂÇ≥, The Tale of Choe Hyeon), Sodaeseongjeon, Jangbakjeon (ÂºµÊú¥ÂÇ≥ The Tale of Jang Bak), Im janggun chungnyeoljeon (ÊûóÂ∞áËªçÂø†ÁÉàÂÇ≥ The Tale of General Im‚Äôs Unwavering Loyalty), Sounjeon (ËòáÈõ≤ÂÇ≥ The Tale of So Un), Choechungjeon (Â¥îÂø†ÂÇ≥ The Tale of Choe Chung), as well as Sassijeon (Ë¨ùÊ∞èÂÇ≥The Tale of the Sa Family), Sukyangjeon (Ê∑ëÈ¶ôÂÇ≥ The Tale of Sukyang), Okgyori (ÁéâÂ¨åÊ¢® The Two Fair Cousins), Lee Baekgyeongjeon (ÊùéÁôΩÊÖ∂ÂÇ≥ The Tale of Lee Baekgyeong).‚Äù From this record, we can thus ascertain that Sodaeseongjeon was written before 1794.  Plot  One year, during the reign of the Ming Dynasty‚Äôs Chenghua Emperor, Zhu Jiansen (1465-1487), there was a man named Soyang who served as the Minister of National Defense. Soyang was over fifty years old but still had no children. One day, he went to the Cheongnyong Temple in the Yeongbo Mountains in Western China. There, he donated gold amounting to thousands of nyang (a Korean unit of currency at the time) to the old monk residing at the temple. A few days later, his wife dreamed that the Dragon King of the East Sea banished his son to the human world for his sins and shortly afterwards, she gave birth to So Daeseong. When So Daeseong was ten years old, both his parents passed away. After organizing and settling his family fortune, So Daeseong left home. During his travels, he runs into an elderly person, wailing from sadness because they cannot obtain a grave site for their mother out of sheer poverty. Upon hearing the person‚Äôs story, he gives them all his money. Afterwards, So Daeseong is reduced to living like a beggar and roams the countryside. In the region of Cheongju, Chancellor Lee is entering old age and is spending time in his hometown. One day, Chancellor Lee has a dream of a blue dragon lying in a fishing spot. Upon waking, he goes to the fishing spot and there finds So Daeseong, sleeping in his impoverished state. He brings So Daeseong home and offers the hand of his youngest daughter, Chaebong, in order to make him his son-in-law. However, Chancellor Lee‚Äôs wife, Madame Wang, is disgruntled by So Daeseong‚Äôs entrance and dislikes his intrusion. Right before So Daeseong and Chaebong‚Äôs wedding, Chancellor Lee becomes ill and passes away. Upon his death, So Daeseong spends all his days sleeping the time away in his grief. Madame Wang and her three sons together plot to drive So Daeseong out and send an assassin after him, but the assassin is instead killed by So Daeseong. Recalling the Chancellor‚Äôs kindness towards him, So Daeseong decides not to pursue revenge and quietly leaves their home. After aimlessly wandering, So Daeseong arrives at the Cheongnyong Temple in the Yeongbo Mountains and learns the art of war and sorcery from an old monk. Meanwhile, the Huns and the Xionites invade China and the Ming Dynasty falls into crisis. So Daeseong receives a sword, armor and helmet, and a swift horse from the spirits of the old monk at Cheongnyong Temple and Chancellor Lee, as well as from the master of Okpan Mountain. Charging into the battlefield, So Daeseong delivers a fatal blow to the enemy general, Seon U, with a single stroke of his sword, and distinguishes himself in battle. The other enemy commander, ‚ÄúHowang‚Äù (Emperor Ho), tricks So Daeseong with numerous schemes and So Daeseong has numerous close calls. However, with help from the heavens, he always manages to escape. After quelling the attacks, So Daeseong is crowned as the ‚ÄúNowang‚Äù (È≠ØÁéã The Foolish Emperor). Even after So Daeseong‚Äôs departure, Chaebong has continuously guarded her chastity and refused marriage. After So Daeseong is crowned emperor, he summons Chaebong and makes her his queen, with their family subsequently enjoying wealth and honor for generations.  Features and significance  Along with Yuchungnyeoljeon (ÂäâÂø†ÁÉàÂÇ≥ The Tale of Yu Chungryeol) and Joungjeon (Ë∂ôÈõÑÂÇ≥ The Tale of Jo Ung), Sodaeseongjeon is one of the most representative examples of the ‚Äúheroic novel‚Äù‚Äîa genre of novels popular during this time period that generally follows the template of tracing a hero‚Äôs life. Based on extant records and the number of currently existing copies, Sodaeseongjeon can be presumed to have been a relatively popular work, even among heroic novels. Moreover, Yi Ok, a prominent Joseon literatus, resided in Hapcheon, South Gyeongsang Province from October 18, 1799 to February 18, 1800, where he reportedly saw printed copies of Sodaeseongjeon. This was a period of time where Korean novels were published as woodblock prints for commercial purposes and thus, it can be assumed that Sodaeseongjeon was also published and distributed in a similar fashion. So Daeseong is portrayed as a glutton who eats around 5.7 liters worth of food per meal. If we estimate the average single serving size in contemporary settings to be around 200 milliliters, the amount of food that So Daeseong ate for one meal is equivalent to about 28-29 servings today. Moreover, So Daeseong is a character that is notorious for constantly sleeping‚Äîto the extent that the saying, ‚ÄúJust like So Daeseong, all you ever do is sleep,‚Äù was created. His association with sleep can be seen in the scene after Chancellor Lee dies, in which So Daeseong falls into despair and sleeps all day long. The fact that the protagonist, So Daeseong, is characterized by a fondness for eating and sleeping is unique‚Äîa character that is seldom found in classical Korean works. Moreover, even though So Daeseong learned the art of war, we see him continuously deceived by the enemy commander‚Äôs schemes and thus, see his weaknesses as well. However, he spends his entire fortune on behalf of the poor and even forgives Chancellor Lee‚Äôs sons, who plotted to kill him, out of his loyalty to Chancellor Lee. Thus, we can also see that he is a good-hearted and loyal character and that he is portrayed in a positive light.  Other  Nakseong biryong (Ê¥õÂüéÈ£õÈæç Flying Dragon in Luoyang) has the same plot as Sodaeseongjeon and only the characters‚Äô names differ. The sequel to Sodaeseongjeon is Yongmunjeon (ÈæçÈñÄÂÇ≥ The Tale of the Dragon‚Äôs Gate).  Archival sources  Versions of Sodaeseongjeon written in both Korean and classical Chinese currently exist. The Korean version exists as a handwritten manuscript, a woodblock print, and a print created through moveable type. The Chinese version exists in two versions as handwritten manuscripts. The Korean woodblock print versions exists in two types: as a woodblock print originally made in Seoul, and as a woodblock print made in the North Jeolla province. There are 36 copies of the former, and 43 copies of the latter, and each manuscript specifies where they were originally printed.

It also portrays a real historical event, the Second Manchu Invasion of 1636, and is thus classified as a yeoksa gundam soseol (historical war story fiction). Moreover, as the story depicts a female protagonist saving the land from the crisis of war, it can also be considered a work of yeoseong yeongung soseol, female hero fiction. However, unlike other, more general works of female hero fiction, the female protagonist in Pak ssi jeon does not disguise herself as a man and participate in the public sphere. Instead, the fact that the female protagonist, without disguise and fully as a woman, does not venture out from the household but still demonstrates heroic behavior, is a unique characteristic of this work.  Authorship  The author and exact time period of creation is unknown, but the author is presumed to be a man. Moreover, there is a handwritten manuscript of Pak ssi jeon stored at Korea University in Seoul, South Korea, that is the oldest extant version and marks its publication date as 1895 and thus, it is estimated that the work was originally published and created sometime around the 19th century.  Plot  During the reign of King Injo of Joseon, there was a man named Yi Gwi, appointed to an important government position and living in Hanyang, that had a bright and talented son, Yi Sibaek. One day, a man named Pak Cheosa, disguised in shabby dress, comes to find Yi Gwi who immediately sees through his disguise. He arranges for his son, Yi Sibaek, and Pak Cheosa‚Äôs daughter, Lady Park, to be married. On the day of their marriage, Yi Gwi and Yi Sibaek go to Geumgang Mountain and find Pak Cheosa to carry out the nuptials. They meet Lady Pak who appears quite uncomely and walks with a limp. Moreover, it seems she only ever eats and sleeps a lot. Yi Gwi‚Äôs wife, Yi Sibaek, and even the servants constantly mistreat Lady Pak and only Yi Gwi feels sorry for her. Aware of his sympathy, Lady Pak pleads with Yi Gwi to arrange another house for her and together with her maid, Gyehwa, they move to a separate household. From this point on, Lady Park demonstrates her superb talents, such as creating a full court attire outfit for her father-in-law, Yi Gwi, in a single night through the use of Taoist magic, or buying a weak horse for 300 nyang (unit of currency in the Joseon Dynasty) and then turning it into an excellent steed and selling it to an envoy from Ming China for 30,000 nyang. Moreover, when her husband Yi Sibaek uses the special water dropper for ink that Lady Pak gives him, he ends up placing first in the civil service examination. In addition, she names the house where she lives as pihwadang (ÈÅøÁ¶çÂ†Ç Sanctuary from Disaster) and plants all kinds of trees in the area in accordance with the Eastern cosmology principles of Yin and Yang and the Five Elements of the Universe, turning that space into a sacred site. For the first time in four years, Lady Pak finally visits her in-laws, using special Taoist magic that allows her to traverse long distances in an instant. Later, Pak Cheosa visits Yi Gwi‚Äôs house and states that Lady Pak‚Äôs curse has finally been lifted and uses the magical skill of transfiguration so that her shabby appearance falls away. Lady Pak is thus revealed to actually be a beautiful woman and afterwards, the Yi family treats her hospitably and she gets along amicably with her husband. Shortly afterwards, the Manchu ruler decides to invade Joseon and his queen consort devises a scheme in which she sends her maid, Gi Hongdae, as an assassin. However, Lady Pak, through Taoist magic, discovers this plan preemptively and drives out Gi Hongdae. Afterwards, Han Yu and Yong Uldae, two commanders of the Manchu nation, gather an army of a hundred thousand men and invade Joseon. Lady Pak once more uses magic to discover these plans and informs Yi Sibaek in order to adequately prepare. However, traitors in the Joseon royal court oppose the countermeasure and it fails. In the end, the Manchu army lays siege to Hanyang, the capital of Joseon, and the Joseon King is forced to surrender. At that moment, Yong Uldae‚Äôs younger brother, Yong Goldae, goes to Lady Pak‚Äôs residence, pihwadang, where he is stabbed and killed by Lady Pak‚Äôs maid, Gyehwa. Yong Uldae mobilizes the army in order to get revenge and goes to pihwadang, where he is defeated by Taoist magic at the hands of Lady Pak. However, because the King of Joseon already surrendered, Yong Uldae takes the crown prince of Joseon and others as hostages. Because of this, the Joseon King greatly regrets not listening to Lady Pak‚Äôs advice, and Lady Pak becomes even more famous throughout the land, enjoying great wealth and honor until the day of her death.  Features and Significance  Because Pak ssi jeon centers around the real historical event of the Second Manchu Invasion of 1636, it is classified as a yeoksa gundam soseol (historical war story fiction). Although the story is clearly fictional, especially with the elements of Lady Pak defeating the characters from the Qing/Manchu with Taoist magic, the fact that the punishment of the Qing characters is done at the hands of a woman can be interpreted as criticizing the powerless, male ruling class of Joseon, as well as a projection of a desire to heal the wounds from the Manchu Invasion, even if only in fictional form. Along with the aforementioned characteristics, Pak ssi jeon is also significant in that it is a work of female hero fiction. In general, female hero fiction features a female protagonist that rejects the traditional female roles fixed within a patriarchal society and instead disguises herself as a man and to pursues traditionally male roles in the public sphere. Such actions can be interpreted as a woman‚Äôs desire to seek equality by imitating a man in a society where men and women are clearly differentiated and fixed within a rigid hierarchy of power. Yet in Pak ssi jeon, Lady Pak desires to fulfill the role of an excellent wife, daughter-in- law, lady of the house, and other typically feminine roles. Moreover, Lady Pak does not disguise herself as a man in order to step into spheres of society that are traditionally occupied only by men. When the war breaks out, Lady Pak stays within the interior space of the home, at pihwadang, and from there, protects other women from the outside violence, and repels exterior enemies through her husband or her maid, as well as Taoist magic. Thus, Pak ssi jeon is ultimately seen as a work in which the ways of women overpower the world of men.  Other  Out of all classical Korean novels, Pak ssi jeon is the only text to be included in both middle and high school Korean language textbooks.  Texts  Considering the fact that over 160 copies of Pak ssi jeon exist today, it can be considered a very popular work that received much attention in its time. All extant copies are written in Korean (hangeul, the Korean alphabet), with 130 of them as handwritten versions, and 30 of them printed. As of yet, no banggakbon versions have been discovered‚Äîcopies of books that were printed privately for commercial purposes. The oldest known copy of Pak ssi jeon is a handwritten manuscript stored within the Korea University collection, under the title of Pak ssi jyeon (Î∞ïÏî®Ï†º). At the end of the book, there is a line that states ‚ÄúEulmi jeongwol deungseo‚Äù (‰πôÊú™ Ê≠£Êúà Ë¨ÑÊõ∏ Transcribed in the First Month of the Eulmi Year) and the ‚Äúeulmi year‚Äù is 1895.

The female protagonist, Bang Gwanju, fights in a war and takes the civil service examination, even becoming betrothed to another woman while retaining her family surname, and thus displays many of the defining characteristics of the female hero fiction as a literary genre. This work has been reviewed as the most controversial of all works of female hero fiction. This is because the female protagonist and the woman she marries act in accordance with a perpetual self-awareness that they live in a patriarchal society where women are oppressed. Bang Gwanju hides her identity as a woman in her daily life and pursues masculine values while living as a man. Yeong Hyebing, the woman she marries, represents traditional feminine values in faithfully carrying out the role of a wife and a mother while seeking an equal relationship in their marriage.  Authorship  The author and original date of creation is unknown, but the author is presumed to be a woman that originally wrote the work sometime in the nineteenth century.  Plot  During the Ming Dynasty, a girl named Bang Gwanju is born in Beijing, China. Although she was born as a biological female, from a young age, she wears boys‚Äô clothes on her own initiative and studies matters that are not traditionally considered ‚Äúfeminine,‚Äù instead pursuing male-gendered activities such as studying the Siseo (Ë©©Êõ∏ Odes and the Histories) and military strategies. Her parents follow her lead and introduce their child as a son to other people. Her parents pass away when she is eight years old and after the three-year mourning period, she wanders the country and views all the mountains and streams for one year. When she is twelve years old, she takes the civil service examination and wins first place in the field of literary and martial arts. Yeong Hyebing is the youngest daughter of Yeong Huijeong, the Minister of Defense. Yeong Hyebin laments the life of a woman regulated by a man and vows to never get married. Yeong Huijeong tries to marry off his daughter and Bang Gwanju meets Yeong Hyebing in person. Immediately perceiving Young Hyebin‚Äôs outstanding character, Bang Gwanju resolves to marry her. Yeong Hyebing immediately recognizes that Bang Gwanju is a woman and on their wedding day, she sets out to discover Bang Gwanju‚Äôs true intentions. As soon as she discovers Bang Gwanju‚Äôs true identity, the two women swear to keep the secret so that Bang Gwanju lives the life of a man and Yeong Hyebing, although she breaks her original vow to never get married, does not live the life of a regular woman controlled by her husband. Bang Gwanju is appointed to a government post and a few years later, she is dispatched to the provinces and separates from Yeong Hyebing. While in the provinces, Gwanju decides to explore the nearby mountains and streams when a bolt of lightning suddenly strikes. She goes to the spot where the bolt of lightning hit the ground and there, finds a child with the words ‚Äúnakseong‚Äù (ËêΩÊòü fallen star) engraved on his chest. She thus names him ‚ÄúNakseong‚Äù and takes him home with her. One year later, Bang Gwanju is promoted to a position in the Ministry of Defense and returns to Seoul where she is reunited with Yeong Hyebing and they decide to raise Nakseong as their own son. Afterwards, the royal court is sent into a disarray through the actions of a group of traitorous subjects and the Northern barbarians simultaneously decide to attack China. Bang Gwanju is made into the commander- in-chief of the army and goes to fight in the war, where she defeats the King of the barbarians and receives his capitulation. The Emperor thus appoints Bang Gwanju as his feudal lord and Yeong Hyebing is bestowed with the honor of being a feudal lord‚Äôs wife. When their son, Bang Nakseong, turns twelve years old, he becomes engaged to Kim Hui‚Äôs daughter and takes the civil service examination, receiving first place. His wife, Madame Kim, has a son and names him ‚ÄúHyeon.‚Äù Bang Nakseong is promoted to the Ministry of Defense. One day, an ascetic from Mount Heng comes to find them and reads Bang Gwanju‚Äôs physiognomy. After predicting that she will die before the age of 40, he forever disappears. In the spring of the following year, Bang Gwanju suddenly becomes ill and has a premonition that she will soon die. She thus sends a message to the Emperor revealing her true identity as a woman and at the age of 39, passes away with Yeong Hyebing following and dying shortly afterwards.  Features and Significance  Of all works of female hero fiction, Bang Hanrim jeon remains the most problematic. This is because both Bang Gwanju and Yeong Hyebing, the two women of the story, are fully aware of the oppression that women face in a patriarchal society and actively seek to ameliorate or escape this situation. Bang Gwanju, aspiring to masculine values, disguises herself as a man and is active in the public sphere, eventually being appointed to a high position in public office. Moreover, she marries another woman and adopts a son, bequeathing her family name to an heir and continuing the family lineage. In this manner, Bang Gwanju achieves fame and prestige and maintains a heteronormative consciousness of the family, fulfilling the values ascribed by a patriarchal ideology. Unlike other works of female hero fiction, where upon discovery of the female protagonist‚Äôs true identity as a woman, they revert to life as a woman, Bang Gwanju practically lives the entirety of her life as a man until her death and never returns to the life of a woman. This emphasizes the way Bang Gwanju seeks to achieve equality with men by adopting or assimilating to a male identity. Yeong Hyebing rejects the thought of being placed in a hierarchical marriage relationship and refuses to get married, but when she meets Bang Gwanju, she immediately realizes her true identity as a woman. As soon as she confirms that they can have a marriage based on equality, she changes her mind and decides to get married. After they get married, Yeong Hyebing dutifully fulfills her roles as a wife to Bang Gwanju and mother to their adopted son. But she does not stop there; whenever Bang Gwanju attempts to assert some kind of patriarchal control over her, Yeong Hyebing quickly admonishes her and she actively works to keep Bang Gwanju‚Äôs secret and maintain an equal relationship between the two of them. Thus, Yeong Hyebing affirms and maintains her feminine values, preserving a fundamental difference between men and women, and by showing this in a positive manner, she concurrently demonstrates the possibility of becoming equal with men. Bang Hanrim jeon juxtaposes Bang Gwanju, who thoroughly pursues masculine values and materializes her autonomy, and Yeong Hyebing, who pursues autonomy and equality with Bang Gwanju through the embodiment of feminine values, and thereby demonstrates the reciprocal unity of masculine values and feminine values. These characteristics are significant in that they demonstrate a viable direction for the feminist movement.  Bibliographic Information  There are currently three extant copies of the story: Nakseong jeon (ËêΩÊòüÂÇ≥ The Tale of Nakseong) in the personal collection of Jeong Byeonguk (a scholar of Korean literature); Bang Hanrim jeon that is the personal copy of Kim Donguk, a professor of Korean literature that was also known by the name ‚ÄúNason ÁæÖÂ≠´‚Äù (now in the Nason Library Collection at Dankook University‚Äôs Yulgok Library); Ssangwan gibong (ÈõôÂ©âÂ•áÈÄ¢ The Strange Meeting of a Couple) in the Academy of Korean Studies collection. All of them are handwritten manuscripts in hangeul, the Korean alphabet. There is virtually no difference in content between the three versions. However, their titles are different, with Bang Hanrim jeon referring to Bang Gwanju‚Äôs job (as a scholar), Nakseong jeon referring to their adopted son, and Ssangwan gibong referring to the strange way in which Bang Gwanju and Yeong Hyebing meet. In the case of Nakseong jeon, there is a note that states ‚ÄúSo Sojeo transcribed this work in the gyemi (Áô∏Êú™) year.‚Äù As the gyemi year refers to 1883 and So Sojeo is a woman‚Äôs name, we can infer that the work was published in 1883 and that a woman transcribed it.

Early life  Rieff was a Cossack who came from Tbilsi (Georgia), when it was part of Russia and he left during the 1917 Russian Revolution and made his way to Australia. Rieff, travelling with a friend, made this journey overland through China to the coast and arrived in Bundeberg in 1919. The friends planned to travel to Western Australia together with camels but they soon decided this would not be possible, due to their inexperience, and his friend decided to return to Russia.  Life in the Northern Territory  Without his friend Rieff explored and prospected his way to Tennant Creek and worked in mines throughout Central Australia including Harts Range Mica Field, the Arltunga Goldfields (now Arltunga Historical Reserve) and the Hatches Creek Wolfram field. Rieff spent some time at Hatches Creek and built a large home there for Dorothy, his Australian born wife, and their six children. In 1927 Rieff was guide to Cecil Madigan and Sir Douglas Mawson who were inspecting nitrate deposits in the West MacDonnell Ranges where Aboriginal people had reported the soft, white, crystalline substance which burned readily. Ultimately this deposit was discovered to be of a high quality but not a large enough amount to be of commercial interest. During the Granites gold rush of 1932 Rieff was one of the first men there, driving Madigan and F.E. Baume there in a buckboard utility, to report on the validity of the rush to the Sydney newspapers. Baume would later write: Tragedy track : the story of the Granites and in this book he called the track from Alice Springs to the mine: \\"a tragedy of desolation, 386 miles (600 kms) of heat, flies, dust and spinifex!\\". Despite, or perhaps because of Madigan's advice that the Granites would be uneconomical to mine Rieff pegged many leases there that he then travelled to Adelaide to sell them. Following his time at the Granites Rieff, and his family, moved into Alice Springs, where they built a large home on Hartley Street that was unusually large for its time. While in Alice Springs he purchased and developed many commercial buildings including the Rieff Building which was demolished to make way for the Yeperenye Shopping Centre.  Later life  Rieff died in 1962 and was survived by his wife Dorothy and their six children. Rieff is also the father of Herbie Laughton, now a famous country music singer, who he never acknowledged; at least not in an official capacity. Laughton was taken from his Aboriginal mother and raised at The Bungalow in Alice Springs.  Legacy  A sundial, at the base of ANZAC Hill in Alice Springs is dedicated to Rieff and is known as the Simon Rieff Memorial and it is part of the, larger, Central Australian Pioneers Memorial. Rieff Court in Sadadeen, Alice Springs, is also named for him.

He was the founder of Calcutta Female School (now known as Bethune College) in Calcutta, which is considered the oldest women's college in Asia. He started his life as a lawyer in England and came to India by virtue of his appointment as a law member of the Governor General's Council of Ministers. His efforts in further women's education were actively supported by Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar and other members of the Bengali Renaissance.  Early life  Bethune was born in Ealing, England, the elder son of John Drinkwater Bethune. He studied in Trinity College, Cambridge after which he received employment as the Counsel of the Home Office. He drafted many important reforms in this position, including the Municipal Reform Act, the Tithe Commutation Act and the County Courts Act. In 1848, he was appointed as a member of the Supreme Council of India and subsequently became the President of the Council of Education.  Founding of Bethune College  Supported by Dakshinaranjan Mukherjee, Ramgopal Ghosh, Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar, and Madan Mohan Tarkalankar, Bethune founded the Calcutta Female School in 1849. The school started in Mukherjee's home in Baitakkhana (now known as Bowbazar), with 21 girls enrolled. The following year, enrollment rose to 80. In November, on a plot on the west side of Cornwallis Square, the cornerstone for a permanent school building was laid. The name \\"Hindu Female School\\" was inscribed on the copper-plate placed in the stone and on the ceremonial silver trowel made for the occasion. Support for the school however waned after Bethune's death in August 1851. The government took it over in 1856, renaming it Bethune School after its founder in 1862‚Äì63. In 1879 it was developed into Bethune College, the first women's college in India.  Death and Burial  John Elliot Bethune died in Calcutta, West Bengal, India, in 1851.

It was written by the poet and courtier Fujiwara no Shunzei between the seventh and eighth months of the second year of Sh≈çji (1200).  Title  The work of poetic criticism composed by Fujiwara no Shunzei in the late summer of 1200 is formally known as Sh≈çji Ninen Shunzei-ky≈ç Waji S≈çj≈ç, literally signifying \\"a document submitted to the emperor (s≈çj≈ç) in Japanese characters (waji) by Shunzei in the second year of Sh≈çji\\".

The form of the title given precedence herein is that used by in his article on Shunzei for the Nihon Koten Bungaku Daijiten.

Shunzei wrote it between the 26th day of the seventh month and the eighth day of the eighth month of Sh≈çji 2 (or, between 6 September and 17 September 1200 according to the Julian calendar). This date is established from references in the Maigetsush≈ç, the diary kept by Shunzei's son Teika, which recounts that on the 15th day of the seventh month he heard tell from his brother-in-law, Saionji Kintsune, of a poetry competition to be hosted by Retired Emperor Go- Toba. According to the entry for the 18th, Teika was initially meant to be included, but that due to the machinations of only poets of a certain age and over were to be allowed participate. Teika was naturally upset at this. In the Maigetsush≈ç entry for the ninth day of the following month, however, Teika records that the previous night it had been decided that he, along with the poets Fujiwara no Ietaka and , would be allowed participate, recording that this was due to the intervention of his father submitting a plea to retired emperor.  Contents  In the treatise, Shunzei gives examples of similar poetry gatherings in the past where there were no age limitations, and in addition to giving his own views on waka composition he praises the progressive style of waka composition employed by his son.

She was the first female mathematics instructor at Saint Peter's University in New Jersey, where she is a professor of mathematics, former vice president, and special assistant to the president of the university. She was the first female president of Pi Mu Epsilon. Education Poiani grew up as a fourth-generation resident of Nutley, New Jersey, where she graduated from Nutley High School. She was an undergraduate in the Douglass Residential College of Rutgers University, earning Phi Beta Kappa honors, and remained at Rutgers for graduate study in mathematics. Her 1971 doctoral dissertation, Mean Cesaro Summability of Laguerre and Hermite Series and Asymptotic Estimates of Laguerre and Hermite Polynomials, concerned Ces√†ro summation, Laguerre polynomials, and Hermite polynomials; her doctoral advisor was Benjamin Muckenhoupt, the namesake of Muckenhoupt weights. Career In 1967, before she completed her doctorate, Poiani joined the Saint Peter's University faculty as a mathematics instructor. This was one year after Saint Peter's University had begun admitting women, and Poiani became the university's first female mathematics instructor, and one of only seven women on the university faculty. She taught mathematics for 35 years, and was named a full professor in 1980. Saint Peter's is a Jesuit school, and Poiani was an early advocate of attention to the principle of cura personalis in Jesuit higher education. She has also been described as having \\"passionate interest in promoting the status of women and minorities in mathematics\\". In 2000, after long-time service to the university as Executive Assistant to the President and Assistant to the President for Planning, she became the university's vice president for student affairs, and the university's first female vice president. In 2011 she became special assistant to the president. Service In 1975, at the invitation of the Mathematical Association of America, Poiani founded and became director of Women and Mathematics. This was a national program that sponsored women in mathematics to speak to female high school students, with the goal of providing role models to the students and encourage them to continue in mathematics. She continued to lead the program until stepping down in 1981. She has also served the Mathematical Association of America as governor of the New Jersey Section, and the National Academy of Sciences as chair of the U.S. Commission on Mathematical Instruction. She was the first woman to be elected as president of the mathematics society Pi Mu Epsilon, serving as president for 1987‚Äì1990. Recognition Pi Mu Epsilon gave Poiani their C. C. MacDuffee Award for Distinguished Service in 1995. In 2003 Poiani was given New Jersey's Women of Achievement award. Saint Peter's University named Poiani an honorary alumna in 2017. The Association for Women in Mathematics has included her in the 2020 class of AWM Fellows for \\"her sustained commitment to encouraging women and the underrepresented at all educational levels to pursue their study of mathematics to keep all career doors open; for founding MAA‚Äôs WAM: Women and Mathematics Lectureship Program; for leadership in Pi Mu Epsilon; and for fostering an appreciation for the power of mathematics\\".

They sit within the communities of Painscastle, Glasbury and Clyro, to the north of a great bend in the course of the Wye valley, west of Hay-on-Wye. ‚ÄòBegwns' is a cymricisation of the English ‚Äòbeacons‚Äô. The Begwns are 1293 acres of common land which was gifted to the National Trust by the Maesllwch Estate in 1992 and managed for grazing and quiet recreation. The common ranges in elevation from 250m at its lowest to 415m at ‚ÄòThe Roundabout‚Äô, a hilltop wooded feature at the heart of the area. A trig point immediately outside of this enclosure is 1m lower. The trees were planted here to commemorate Queen Victoria‚Äôs Diamond Jubilee with a wall constructed around them in 1887 for protection. There are a handful of small pools on the common, of which the largest is Monks Pond. These ponds contain the increasingly uncommon aquatic fern, pillwort and other uncommon pond plants like Tubular Water-dropwort. Numerous springs feed streams which run both north to a small river known as the Bachawy, a left-bank tributary of the Wye, and to the south, directly into the Wye. Access The Begwns are crossed by a number of public footpaths and bridleways though the entire area is mapped as open access providing free access to walkers across all of the land. There are in addition a handful of tarmacked minor public roads cut across the common, together with a number of unmetalled highways shown on Ordnance Survey maps as ‚Äòother routes with public access‚Äô (ORPAs). Geology The larger part of the Begwns is formed by the Pridoli age siltstones and mudstones of the Raglan Mudstone Formation, the lowermost unit of the Old Red Sandstone (commonly reduced to 'ORS'). The ORS characterises the landscape of the Brecon Beacons National Park which is seen to the south from the Begwns. A number of sandstone bands are traced across the slopes of the common. The lower northern slopes of the Begwns are formed from similar rocks dating from the Wenlockian and Ludlovian epochs of the Silurian period. A handful of north-south aligned normal faults cut these rocks with downthrows to the east in the east and to the west in the west. The entire range lies within a block defined by the Church Stretton Fault Zone to the northwest and the Swansea Valley Disturbance to the southeast. Some isolated patches of peat have been mapped as have some small areas of head consisting of pebbly sand, silt and clay. Archaeology There are a number of scheduled ancient monuments in the area amongst which are Maesgwyn mound, a presumed Bronze Age ritual site, a round cairn to the north of the roundabout and nearby is a probable Bronze Age standing stone An extensive mediaeval settlement has been identified at Pentre Jack at the western end of the common.

Synopsis Macau's return to Chinese sovereignty in 1999 ushered in that city's \\"golden age.\\" By 2012, the value of Macau's gaming industry was nine times that of Las Vegas, and Macao had become the world's foremost gambling destination. During this period, a unique profession arose: \\"casino brokers,\\" who provided Macao's gamblers with high-interest lines of credit, under-the-table bets, and other services. It was a high-stakes, high- reward business that made for more thrilling play, but amplified the risks for players, brokers and casinos alike. This heightened risk made gambling more exciting and more dangerous for the participants; it also impacted their interpersonal relationships and outlook on life. It was as if everyone involved were walking on a tightrope. By 2014, however, China's ongoing anti- corruption campaign had dealt a serious blow to the gaming industry in Macao, ending the golden age.

Kunnecke was found guilty of Demmler's murder and sentenced to life imprisonment at the South Dakota State Penitentiary, from where he escaped in 1919, never to be seen again. Move to America Kunnecke moved from his native Germany in 1884, first settling in Mountain Home, Idaho, where he first started out by running a shoe shop. He married Regina Kopp in 1896, through a marriage bureau. He bought a herd of sheep, tending to them near Rocky Bar, while his wife worked at the farm. Eventually, the herd grew at a mysteriously rapid rate, and the couple had to hire farmhands, several of whom later disappeared under suspicious circumstances. Murders =Koeninger= In 1895, Regina's nephew, known only by his surname Koeninger, arrived from Germany, and William quickly employed him as a farmhand. Koeninger remained there for a year and a half, but then suddenly disappeared in the area of Trinity Mountain's lakes. Kunnecke then began searching for another herder in Rocky Bar, explaining that his previous one had returned to Germany. This claim was investigated by the German consulate in Portland, Oregon, which discovered that Koeninger's parents hadn't heard from him for a while. They also informed the consulate that Kunnecke had owed their son $800, for which he had given a note for the promised amount. The German consulate demanded that he paid the required sum, but William claimed that he had already done so. In turn, he asked that arrangements be made for an indemnity bond, as a guarantee that his money can be refunded. Since a bond could not be taken out at the time, it was delivered at a later date to Mountain Home. People were wondering about his reason to leave suddenly, and since the suspicion that Kunnecke had killed Koeninger was so strong, county commissioners offered a $1,000 reward for any information about his whereabouts. Kunnecke was last seen riding a saddle horse, claiming to be en route to Rocky Bar. It's believed that he instead went to Trinity Mountain, to get rid of any evidence there. A burned-down shack belonging to Kunnecke was later discovered in the mountains, and people suspected that Koeninger's body was discarded and subsequently burned to ashes in a deliberately-started fire, so nobody could find him. =Litzman= In the spring of 1900, the body of another sheep owner named Litzman was found on a trail between his farm and that of the Kunneckes. According to his surviving brother, Litzman was known to carry a lot of money on his person, as he had no faith in banks, but strangely, not a single dollar was found on his body. Kunnecke had already left town, ostensibly to skip a court-appointed $500 bail bond about violating a law about herding diseased sheep. His wife had remained in the town only so she could close up the business, withdraw $80 from the Rice & Co. Bank, which belonged to her nephew, and later join her husband. It later transpired that William had poisoned him, stolen the money and simply left the body lying on the trail. =Andrew Demler= After returning to Germany for a short time, Kunnecke returned to America, passing through Spearfish, South Dakota before settling on a farm in Cottonwood's creeks. Shortly after his arrival, Kunnecke ran into trouble with the law, having been accused, tried and convicted of stealing 300 sheep from James Cox, for which he had to pay $1,350 and spend a month in jail. In due time, he hired a young man named Charles Rohrbecker as a farmhand. Charles later disappeared, prompting his brother, William, who resided in Iowa, to come asking about him. Kunnecke explained to the young William that his brother had quit, and that he didn't know what happened to him after that. William was offered a job at the ranch, where he met with Andrew Demler, who had already worked there for a few months, with Rohrbecker quickly learning that the fellow ranch hand never went anywhere without his trusty sheep-lined coat and dog. For a few weeks, everything was going fine. One day, however, Andrew vanished without a trace. When questioned, Kunnecke claimed that Demler had quit, and that he had sold all of his sheep to him. Kunnecke then asked Rohrbecker to take over the job, to which he agreed. They then rode out to the sheep camp, where they found Demler's dog, sniffing at a pool of frozen blood to the side of a sled. Kunnecke tried to explain that he had killed a sick ewe and had discarded it there. This did not convince Rohrbecker, who opened the door to the little shack and found Demler's prized coat. The young William inquired about why it was there, receiving a threatening answer from his employer, who thought that he had asked \\"so many damn fool [sic] questions.\\" Panicked, Rohrbecker tried to quit right then and there, but was warned by Kunnecke that he'd have to stay at least until a new farm hand could be hired. Realizing that he had killed Demler and that the same fate probably awaited him as well, Rohrbecker reluctantly agreed to stay. Kunnecke then left, taking both horses with him, leaving the frightened William herding the sheep. While gathering the sheep, Rohrbecker spotted a washout that would lead him out of the sheep camp, waiting until nightfall before escaping. He ran east towards Fort Pierre, so he could catch the nearest train back to Iowa. At some point during his night-long trot through the snow, he heard hoof beats on the trail behind him, and quickly hid in a ditch to avoid the rider. After the rider had gone away, he found his way to Fort Pierre, hopped on a train and once he arrived in Iowa, he wrote a letter to Sheriff Feeney about his suspicions toward Kunnecke. Capture Initially skeptical of the claims, Feeney still decided to investigate the matter, as he knew of Kunnecke's previous criminal behavior, coupled with the fact that Demler hadn't been seen since February. He rode out to the farm and questioned the sheep herder, who claimed that Andrew had quit and gone off to New York through Pierre. Unconvinced by Kunnecke's story, Feeney visited him multiple times over the following three days, searching for any evidence of murder, only to come up empty-handed. Kunnecke did not realise who the man was at first, until a freight hauler asked him what the sheriff was doing at his farm. This statement frightened William, who immediately rushed out to the creek and dug out Demler's frozen body, intending to hide it in a secluded location and subsequently burn it. Unbeknownst to him, however, Sheriff Feeney, along with a posse of six other men and two teenagers, had gone to his farm again in search of any clues. On the way to the farm, they noticed wagon tracks heading toward Plum Creek. The odd thing was that there were three tracks, while there should've been two, with one of them leading off toward a nearby creek bottom. Feeney and one of men, Henry Schacht, followed the tracks, and soon discovered a small clump of hair and freshly dug dirt. They searched for a body, but again, nothing turned up. Despite this, Feeney was certain somebody had been buried here, and the posse then went towards the wagon tracks. Only three miles later, they ran into none other than William Kunnecke himself. Feeney confronted him about working so early, with Kunnecke claiming he'd been after firewood. The now-fed up Feeney asked him to get off the wagon so it could be searched, to which Kunnecke agreed. He was found to be in possession of only a broken pocketknife and an axe. Feeney and Schacht got Kunnecke on a horse, and then rode out with him to Hayes, while the others continued searching for a body. Not long after, the posse found two body pieces belonging to Demler, 50 miles down in a washout at Plum Creek. His frozen body had been hacked to pieces, but that was not the cause of death: it was apparent that Andrew had been shot in the head with a pistol, before being fired at again at the mount and head with a shotgun, leaving powder burns on the clothing. In the meantime, Kunnecke had already spoken to a lawyer of the Horner and Stewart law firm. Feeney then marched him off to the Hughes County jail. Imprisonment and escape William Kunnecke spent almost a year in prison awaiting trial, as his lawyers had secured him a January term, following an unsuccessful bid for a change of venue, citing local prejudice against their client. During this time, he tried to escape on three separate occasions, and on one of them, he was found with a saw made from an old caseknife, a stove poker, a large bottle and a stick. After being punished for this, he proceeded to go on a six-day long hunger strike, tried to kill himself by eating a bar of soap, and finally, another suicide attempt by starting a fight with two other Native American prisoners, during which he was beaten up before the jailer could interfere. In the meantime, there was a report of a human skeleton found at Kunnecke's old farm, which later turned out to be animal bones. Eventually, William Kunnecke confessed to Demler's murder, although he claimed it was in self-defense. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, and sent off to the South Dakota State Penitentiary. On September 3, 1919, while watering the prison lawn, he managed to slip through the gate unnoticed, when it was opened so some work teams could go through. His absence was quickly noticed by Warden Redfield, who pursued Kunnecke with an automobile, but by then, the convict had already put some distance between himself and the authorities. Detective agencies through the entire USA were notified about him, but although he spoke with a distinct German accent, he travelled only at night, successfully evading police. One report claimed that a man matching Kunnecke's description was seen at El Paso, Texas, before making his way over the border into Mexico, but this has not been conclusively proven, and his ultimate fate remains unknown.
