It premiered on the Fox network on . The episode was written by series creator Chris Carter and executive producer Frank Spotnitz, and directed by Kim Manners. \\"Provenance\\" helps to explore the series' overarching mythology. The episode received a Nielsen household rating of 5.5 and was watched by 5.8 million households and 9.7 million viewers. It received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The show centers on special agents of the FBI who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, when rubbings from the spaceship resurface the FBI hides its investigation from the X-Files. Meanwhile, Scully is forced to take drastic measures when she discovers a threat to William. \\"Provenance\\" introduced the character of the Toothpick Man, played by Alan Dale. This character became the leader of the New Syndicate and worked within the FBI during the show's ninth season. The episode makes reference to rubbings from an alien wreck, a direct continuation from the plots of the sixth season finale \\"Biogenesis\\" and the seventh season opener \\"The Sixth Extinction\\". Plot Navajo rubbings are found in the satchel of a motorcyclist who crashed while attempting to cross the U.S.-Canada border. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is called into a meeting with Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.), Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) and a few unknown men. She is shown a copy of the rubbings and is asked whether she can identify them. After the meeting, Scully explains to John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) that the rubbings are similar to ones she found on a wrecked spacecraft three years prior. Meanwhile, the motorcyclist uses an alien artifact which begins to heal the wounds from his crash. Meanwhile, in Alberta, a downed spacecraft is being excavated under the direction of Josepho, the leader of a UFO cult. At the FBI, Doggett breaks into Skinner's office and steals the rubbings, along with an FBI personnel file belonging to Agent Robert Comer (Neal McDonough), the motorcyclist. Reyes reveals that Comer's rubbings do not match those from Africa, suggesting the existence of a second craft. Meanwhile, Comer steals a truck, goes to Scully's apartment, overpowers Margaret Scully (Sheila Larken) and locks himself in William's room. Scully arrives and, after a struggle, is forced to shoot Comer when he tries to smother the baby. The mortally wounded Comer tells Scully that William \\"has to die\\". Scully searches his jacket and discovers the artifact. Later, in Calgary, one of the cultists, the Overcoat Woman, sees a newspaper headline about Comer's shooting; she rushes to the dig site and informs Josepho. In Washington, Kersh admits to Scully and Doggett that Comer had gone undercover into Josepho's cult, and reveals that he was a former U.S. military officer. Kersh explains that Comer was given the assignment to investigate a series of death threats against Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). As Reyes brings William back to Scully's apartment, Comer's artifact flies over William and hovers above his head. Scully, realizing something is wrong, plans to drive William to somewhere safe. At the same time, Doggett notices the Overcoat Woman watching them nearby. As Scully and Reyes drive away, Doggett confronts the woman at gunpoint, but she runs him over. Scully places William under the care of The Lone Gunmen, but they are soon ambushed by the Overcoat Woman. Upon finding an injured Doggett, Scully quickly rushes back to the Lone Gunmen, aware that someone is after her son. With Melvin Frohike (Tom Braidwood) and Richard Langly (Dean Haglund) incapacitated, the woman opens the back door of the van to find John Fitzgerald Byers (Bruce Harwood) holding William. The woman puts a gun to Byers' head. Production right \\"Provenance\\" was written by series creator Chris Carter and executive producer Frank Spotnitz, and directed by Kim Manners. Manners was very pleased with Anderson's performance in the episode, later saying that her acting \\"was very sexual.\\" He further elaborated, \\"There's some burning within her that really comes across on screen. She really is brilliant, and she brings so much; the camera loves her.\\" A large portion of the episode was based on the ancient astronaut theory; a theory that proposes intelligent extraterrestrial beings have visited Earth in antiquity or prehistory and made contact with humans.Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 169 The themes had previously been visited in the \\"Biogenesis\\"/\\"The Sixth Extinction\\"/\\"Amor Fati\\" story arc.Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 202 The episode marked the first appearance of Alan Dale as the Toothpick Man, the leader of the New Syndicate who works within the FBI. An interview with Digital Spy described him as \\"effectively [stepping] into the nicotine-stained chair of the departed Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis) as the head of a shady new syndicate, although he was later exposed as an alien.\\" Laura Leigh Hughes makes her third and final appearance as Kersh's Assistant. She had previously appeared in the sixth-season episodes \\"Triangle\\" and \\"Dreamland.\\" The scenes in Calgary were actually shot in the back of the Universal Studios lot in Los Angeles. In order to convert the Los Angeles cityscape into Calgary's, Mat Beck created a matte of the shot; the background buildings were then edited out.

Broadcast and reception  \\"Provenance\\" first premiered on the Fox network in the United States on March 3, 2002. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 5.5, meaning that it was seen by 5.5% of the nation's estimated households and was viewed by 5.8 million households. \\"Provenance\\" was viewed by 9.7 million viewers and was the 61st most watched episode of television that aired during the week ending March 3.

Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode an A‚Äì grade. Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk concluded that \\"Provenance\\", along with its follow-up \\"Providence\\", \\"does a fairly good job without including Duchovny\\" due to its adherence to \\"the series' main storyline [about] the government conspiracies.\\" Other reviews were more negative. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two noted that Anderson was constantly playing \\"a mother who's always crying, shouting or looking miserable\\" in the episode. They wrote that the episode's \\"characters no longer make sense\\" and that the plot has \\"been so required to dance through the little conspiracy hoops that there's no consistency any more.\\" Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson criticized the idea to suggest that Mulder died in the episode, due to the fact that Carter announced Duchovny would return for the season finale.Shearman and Pearson, p. 268 M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, criticised the plot of the episode, saying that it \\"throws up many elements that we've seen the series do better elsewhere...in the hope that something will stick\\".

","title":"Provenance (The X-Files)"},{"id":"21776766","text":"\\"Scary Monsters\\" is the fourteenth episode of the ninth season of the American science fiction television series The X-Files. It originally aired on the Fox network on . It was written by Thomas Schnauz and directed by Dwight H. Little. The episode is a \\"monster-of-the-week\\" episode, a stand-alone plot which is unconnected to the mythology, or overarching fictional history, of The X-Files. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 5.1 and was viewed by 8.2 million viewers in its initial broadcast. It received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Special Agent Leyla Harrison (Jolie Jenkins) takes Reyes and Doggett on a drive into the mountains after a woman stabs herself repeatedly and her widowed husband refuses to let anyone see their son. The three soon discover that the boy's imagination can bring killer bug-like creatures to life. The idea for \\"Scary Monsters\\" stemmed from an idea that became the episode's teaser. Fellow writer Vince Gilligan suggested making Tommy the episode's villain. Originally, the story featured Doggett and Reyes investigating the case with a new agent. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Schnauz that the new FBI agent should be Leyla Harrison, played by Jolie Jenkins, who had first appeared in the Spotnitz-penned eighth season episode \\"Alone\\". The writing staff used Leyla's character to comment on the state of the show and, most notably, the members of the audience who preferred Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) over Doggett. Plot In his room in Fairhope, Pennsylvania, Tommy Conlon (Gavin Fink) believes he sees a monster reflected in his mirror. He calls for his dad, Jeffrey Conlon (Scott Paulin), who looks under the bed and sees a crawling bug-like creature. He lies to his son, telling him that he sees nothing, and tells Tommy to go back to sleep. Tommy sees the creature again and calls for his dad; Jeffrey holds the door shut as Tommy bangs on the door. Meanwhile, Agent Leyla Harrison (Jolie Jenkins) tells Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) about a woman who stabbed herself repeatedly. Harrison insists that the case is an X-File and that the woman was killed by monsters that her son Tommy saw. She also believes that the monster killed the family cat, Spanky. Scully dismisses Harrison's claims, so Harrison dupes John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) into investigating. Doggett, Reyes, and Harrison arrive at the Conlon residence in Fairhope, Pennsylvania. The agents talk to Tommy and conclude that something is going on. They soon discover that their car will not start. Back at her apartment, Scully is visited by Gabe Rotter (Brian Poth), a potential suitor of Harrison's. He presents Scully with the corpse of Spanky. Scully does an ad hoc necropsy and concludes that the cat bit its stomach open to try to get something out. She also discovers a cavity, where it appears something had lived inside the cat. Doggett, Reyes, and Harrison camp out at the Conlon's house and soon witness the monsters: large, silverfish-like creatures that multiply when shot by Doggett. Alerted by Scully, the local sheriff (Steve Ryan) arrives, but a scuffle ensues. The sheriff draws a gun, and Doggett gut punches him, only to have his hand go completely through the man's stomach. Upon investigation, Reyes is unable to find any organs in the man's body. Tommy shows Reyes the pictures he has been drawing. They include the sheriff with a gun, insect creatures, and Reyes with an insect creature bursting from her body. Reyes asks Tommy why he would imagine such things, and Tommy replies because he is very scared. Suddenly, the sheriff's body disappears, and Reyes doubles over in pain. Doggett and Harrison pull up her shirt to reveal movement in her abdomen, as if something is trying to get out. Harrison then begins to bleed from her eyes. Doggett approaches Tommy, orders him to stop, and follows him down the hall when he fails to stop. Doggett follows Tommy into a room, but plummets into a blackened abyss where he is attacked by the insects. However, due to Doggett's skepticism, he is able to fight off the illusion. Because he does not believe they are real, they cease to be real. Doggett explains to Jeffrey that all of the creatures are imaginary and are produced by Tommy's imagination. This includes the bugs, the \\"sheriff\\" who had no organs, and Reyes's and Harrison's ailments. Jeffrey's wife and their cat Spanky killed themselves trying to remove the insect creatures, believing they were real. Doggett tricks and subdues Tommy by pretending to set the house on fire. He pours a gas canister filled with water over the floor and furniture, acting as though it is gasoline. Because Tommy believes it to be real, when Doggett lights a match, he sees an inferno surrounding him in the living room. Tommy passes out in fear. Tommy is eventually transported to a psychiatric ward where his imagination is suppressed by watching a wall of television screens. ProductionWriting= \\"Scary Monsters\\" was written by Thomas Schnauz, who had previously penned the ninth-season episode \\"Lord of the Flies\\". The entry was directed by Dwight H. Little, his first and only directing credit for the series.Huwritz and Knowles, pp. 236‚Äì40. Schnauz explained that before the episode was green-lit, the writing staff needed to get the script done as quickly as possibly, but Schnauz only had the teaser conceived. When he went to pitch it, he even had a \\"whole other story that wasn't working.\\" Fellow writer Vince Gilligan suggested that Shnauz make the child the root of the all of the episode's problems. However, the writing staff did not want the story to develop into a \\"kid-in-the-cornfield\\" territory, according to Gilligan (a reference to a 1961 episode of The Twilight Zone entitled \\"It's a Good Life\\", in which a monster-child can control the world. When the writers began to piece the script together, they realized that they needed a villain, and the only character that could play the part would be Tommy.Fraga, pp. 216‚Äì17. =Filming= Schnauz's original story featured Doggett and Reyes investigating the case with a new agent. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz suggested to Schnauz that the new FBI agent should be Leyla Harrison, played by Jolie Jenkins. Harrison, who had first appeared in the Spotnitz-penned eighth season episode \\"Alone\\", was created and named in memory of an Internet fan of The X-Files and prolific writer of fan fiction of the same name, who had died of cancer on February 10, 2001. Jenkins' character, according to Spotnitz, brought out the \\"Clint [Eastwood]\\" in Robert Patrick's character John Doggett and her performance was called \\"near perfection\\" by Spotnitz during the audio commentary for \\"Alone\\". Near the end of \\"Scary Monsters\\", Leyla and Gabe Rotter were supposed to walk off-screen, holding hands, which prompted series director Kim Manners to sardonically ask \\"when did this turn into the fucking Brady Bunch?\\" The sequence was subsequently cut. The writing staff used Leyla's character to comment on the state of the show and, most notably, the members of the audience who preferred Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) over Doggett. Due to Harrison's extensive knowledge of the X-Files, the episode contains several references to previous episodes. Harrison suggests early on that Doggett and Reyes may be dealing with a person capable of channeling electricity, a reference to the third season episode \\"D.P.O.\\" Doggett later suggests that the three of them may be experiencing some sort of hallucination, and cites the events in the sixth season episode \\"Field Trip\\" as an example. Finally, when Tommy shows Reyes his drawing, he tells her \\"I made this\\", a possible reference to the tagline at the end of every Ten Thirteen Production.Shearman and Pearson, pp. 272‚Äì73. During the filming of the episode, The X-Files was canceled by the Fox network, meaning that the show would not return for a tenth season. Robert Patrick explained that series creator Chris Carter watched him film a scene‚Äîan act which he had reportedly not done since Patrick had been hired in 2000‚Äîand then informed him of the news. Patrick noted that Fox's new show 24 was being heavily promoted instead of The X-Files, an act which he felt was like being \\"abandoned by Fox\\".Hurwitz and Knowles, pp. 204‚Äì06.  Broadcast and reception  \\"Scary Monsters\\" originally aired in the United States on the Fox network on April 14, 2002, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on February 16, 2003. The episode's initial broadcast was viewed by approximately 5.4 million households and 8.2 million viewers, making it the fifty-seventh most watched episode of television that aired during the week ending January 27. \\"Scary Monsters\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 5.1, meaning that it was seen by 5.1% of the nation's estimated households. The episode received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a \\"C‚Äì\\" grade. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two enjoyed Schnauz's script, calling it \\"better than most\\" of season nine's episodes, and noted that he wrote it with \\"pace and wit\\". They noted, however, that the entry's self-references \\"feel like carping [‚Ä¶] at the audience who are still left to complain.\\" Despite this, Shearman and Pearson also positively critiqued several of the episode's juxtapositions, such as the scene featuring Scully performing an autopsy on a cat while wearing a kitchen apron that says \\"something smells goooood\\", calling them \\"the funniest of the season\\". M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, called the episode a \\"solid little entry\\", saying that it was a \\"nice spin on the isolation stories that the series has always done so effectively\\".

The teleplay of the episode was written by series creator Chris Carter, from a story by former series star David Duchovny, Carter, and executive producer Frank Spotnitz; the entry was directed by Duchovny. \\"William\\" helps to explore the series' overarching mythology. The episode received a Nielsen household rating of 5.8, being watched by 6.1 million households and 9.3 million viewers upon its initial broadcast. It received mixed reviews from television critics, many of whom were unhappy with the episode's conclusion. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett finds a strange, disfigured man (Chris Owens) in the X-Files office and, on his whim, they test his DNA. They learn that the man shares DNA with Fox Mulder (Duchovny), and may possibly even be him. The answers become even more surprising when Scully's son, baby William, is put on the line. \\"William\\" marked the return of David Duchovny to the series, after his departure following the eighth season finale \\"Existence\\". The genesis for the episode was a storyline Duchovny had developed during the series' eighth season; he originally pitched an idea featuring a mysteriously disfigured person introducing himself to Scully and admitting that he possessed a connection to Mulder. Chris Owens, whose character Jeffrey Spender had previously been killed off in the sixth season episode \\"One Son\\", was asked to return to the series for the episode.  Plot  In the teaser, a couple, the Van De Kamps (Adam Nelson and Shannon Hile), adopt Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) infant son, William (James and Travis Riker). The episode then jumps back a week. Scully takes William out of her car while an unknown man (Chris Owens) watches them. Later, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) is attacked in the X-Files office by the same man. After a struggle, Doggett subdues him. His face is revealed to be horribly scarred. Later, Scully speaks with the man. He claims he received his burns due to alien testing and that he knew Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). He further elaborates that he was sent to the FBI to retrieve certain files. Scully suspects the man is lying, but asks to examine his burns to investigate his strange claims. He notes that they are the result of an injection that failed to transform him into one of the aliens. The man claims a new conspiracy has formed after the previous one was destroyed; the new one being hidden within the government and the conspirators involved being alien. Doggett theorizes that the man is actually Mulder. Scully takes the man to her house to give him the files he seeks. Suddenly, William begins to cry, only to be quieted when the scarred man picks him up. Meanwhile, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) meets with Doggett and the two discuss the idea that the man is actually Mulder. Skinner points out the inconsistencies in Doggett's reasoning, but a DNA test is undertaken anyway. Scully is told by the scarred man that William is part alien and that she is being used to raise the child. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) and Doggett tell Scully that the man's DNA is a match to Mulder's, but Scully refuses to believe it. While the three are talking, the scarred man quietly slips into William's room with a syringe. Though William's crying alerts the agents, the scarred man manages to sneak out of the room before they reach William. Reyes and Scully take the baby to the hospital and Doggett discovers the man's syringe. The doctor reports that William is fine except for an elevated amount of iron in his blood. In interrogation, Scully confronts the scarred man about his motives. It is revealed that he is actually Jeffrey Spender, a former FBI agent supposedly killed by The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) three years earlier. Spender is also Mulder's half- brother. Spender admits his actions were a ruse and that the syringe contained magnetite meant to make William normal. He explains that the aliens need the child in order to successfully invade the world, but now they have lost him. However, he notes that the conspirators will always pursue the child, despite what he has done. Spender says that he acted out of his hatred for his father, since the new conspiracy was created by The Smoking Man after the alien rebels burned the original group. Scully muses over Spender's words and decides that the only way to truly protect William is to give him up for adoption so that he may have a better life. The episode then jumps to the Van De Kamps, who tuck in their new son. William looks at his mobile but he can no longer move it telekinetically, an event which happened in \\"Nothing Important Happened Today\\".  Production  right The story for \\"William\\" was written by former series co-star David Duchovny, series creator Chris Carter, and executive producer Frank Spotnitz; the screenplay was written solely by Carter, and the entry was directed by Duchovny. \\"William\\" marked the return of David Duchovny, in some capacity, to the series, after his departure following the eighth season finale \\"Existence\\". In fact, Duchovny makes a cameo appearance in the episode, appearing as a reflection in Scully's eye.Kessenich (2002), p. 204 The genesis for the episode was a storyline Duchovny had developed during the series' eighth season. He had originally pitched an idea featuring a mysteriously disfigured person introducing himself to Scully and admitting that he has a connection to Mulder. Reportedly, the idea for Scully to give William up for adoption was mandated by Carter and Spotnitz. Duchovny, Anderson, and executive producer John Shiban were not happy with this turn of events, due to them being parents and feeling that the action was not realistic. In the end, they \\"grudgingly consented\\".Kessenich (2002), pp. 194‚Äì195 Three years after Spender had been written out of the series‚Äîin the sixth season episode \\"One Son\\"‚Äîand actor Chris Owens had moved to Toronto, Ontario, in Canada, Owens received an unexpected phone call from David Duchovny, who said that The X-Files production crew was filming the series' finale as well as another episode late in the season, and that he wanted to bring Spender back for these two episodes. Duchovny reassured Owens that Spender's survival would be explained away via the plot device of an alien injection but mentioned that the experience would not be fun for Owens, as he would be \\"under all that shit\\"; Owens did not realize what Duchovny meant until he got to the studio and personally saw the makeup for Spender's disfigured appearance, a sight that shocked Owens.Hurwitz and Knowles (2008), p. 206  Broadcast and reception  \\"William\\" originally aired on the Fox network on April 28, 2002, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One on March 2, 2003. The episode's initial broadcast was viewed by approximately 6.1 million households, and 9.3 million viewers. \\"William\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 5.8, meaning that roughly 5.8 percent of all television-equipped households, were tuned in to the episode. It was the fifty-fourth most watched episode of television that aired during the week ending April 28. The episode was later included on The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 ‚Äì Super Soldiers, a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien super soldiers arc. The episode received mixed reviews from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A‚Äì grade. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three stars out of five. The two criticized the idea that Scully would give her child up for adoption solely based on the word of Jeffrey Spender, noting \\"if she wasn't going to give it away for the sake of its own protection after a UFO cult abducted it [in 'Provenance'/'Providence'], then why should she because Jeffrey Spender of all people comes along and informs her that it's under threat?\\" Shearman and Pearson, however, did praise Chris Owens' acting, writing that he did a \\"great job\\".Shearman and Pearson (2009), pp. 274‚Äì276 Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, wrote a largely negative review of the episode and derided its plot. He heavily criticized the idea that Scully would offer William up for adoption. Kessenich did however praise Duchovny's directing, noting that \\"[he] did a masterful job of luring me back to this world of The X-Files\\".Kessenich (2002), pp. 203‚Äì208 Aaron Kinney from Salon wrote that the episode \\"scuttled the entire\\" baby William subplot.

The episode originally aired on the Fox network on May 5, 2002. The teleplay for the episode was written by David Amann, from a story by John Shiban and Amann, and was directed by Kim Manners. The episode helps to explore one of the show's story arc involving John Doggett finding the truth behind his son's murder. The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 5.1, being watched by 5.38 million households, and 7.8 million viewers in its initial broadcast. The episode received largely positive reviews from critics. The show centers on FBI special agents who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files; this season focuses on the investigations of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish), and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). In this episode, Doggett stumbles upon a case that may hold a connection to the murder of his son. With the help of an FBI cadet named Rudolph Hayes (Jared Poe), Doggett acquires information to help his current case as well as establish the link between the present, his Jane Does, and the past‚Äîhis son, Luke. The link is a man named Nicholas Regali, an organized crime participant who has an association with Bob Harvey, the only suspect in Luke's case. Though the cadet, Hayes, is not who he says he is, his information proves invaluable in Doggett's search for release from his son's death. The idea for \\"Release\\" was developed by Shiban, who handed the script over to Amann. The character of Rudolph Hayes was crafted to be an ambiguous character: either he was a genius who was adept at solving crime, comparable to Sherlock Holmes, or he was a criminal mastermind, like Professor Moriarty. The final scene, featuring Doggett scattering his son's ashes, was difficult for Patrick to film, but thanks to Manners' help, he was able to achieve the desired effect.  Plot  In Mendota, Minnesota, John Doggett (Robert Patrick) arrives at an abandoned apartment building after getting a tip, and sees a figure bolt out of one of the rooms during the night. He hears a scratching sound and claws away at the fresh plaster wall until blood begins streaming downward. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) performs an autopsy on the body Doggett found and one of her FBI cadets, Rudolph Hayes, accurately guesses that the victim hooked up with a psychotic killer at a bar. Hayes's suggestions lead Scully to connect this murder to another killing two weeks earlier. In the meantime, Doggett wonders why anyone tipped him off about the murder, since it is not an X-File. Doggett and Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) try to get more help from Hayes. He tells them that the killer they are looking for is a criminal linked to organized crime. The two agents later meet up with Nicholas Regali, a former mobster who claims he is looking for a job in the area. They later find out that Hayes's intuition about Regali was correct. Meanwhile, Hayes returns to his apartment complex where walls are covered with crime scene photos related to the death of Luke Doggett. Eventually, Doggett asks Hayes for help solving the case about his son's death. Hayes tells Doggett that he believes that Robert Harvey was behind the kidnapping of Luke, but that Regali killed him. Doggett approaches FBI Assistant Director Brad Follmer (Cary Elwes) for help on the case. Doggett's ex-wife, Barbara Doggett, meets up for a lineup at a police station. Barbara does not recognize Regali or anyone else on the lineup. Scully finds some similarities between Luke and the two dead bodies, but no forensic proof. Doggett comes to realize that Regali has had help from someone within the FBI all along. Follmer informs Reyes and Doggett that Cadet Hayes is really Stuart Mimms, a former mental patient. He also informs them that Mimms lived in New York City during the year of Luke's murder, hinting that Mimms is the murderer and not Regali. Doggett and Reyes assemble a SWAT team to raid Mimms apartment. Mimms is taken into police custody and at a new lineup, Barbara recognizes Mimms. At a meeting between Follmer and Regali, Follmer says he is finished consorting with him, but Regali reminds him he was being bribed, and threatens to blackmail him. In the meantime, Mimms tells Scully that he first noticed the case of Luke Doggett when he read it in a newspaper. He further states that he lied about his name so that he could help solve the case. At the end, he still pushes that Regali is the real murderer of Doggett's son, and not him. Later on, Doggett approaches Regali. Regali tells him a \\"hypothetical\\" story about how a pedophile took a young boy to his home. A \\"businessman\\" then walked in on the incident, realized that the boy has seen his face, and feared that the boy might associate him with the crime. The businessman then found a solution to the boy seeing his face: he murdered him. Regali then walks away and Doggett, filled with rage, unholsters his gun and follows. But a gunshot rings out and when Doggett gets outside, he sees Regali has been killed by Follmer. Later, Doggett and Barbara scatter Luke's ashes into the ocean, finally achieving the release he has sought.  Production  right The story for \\"Release\\" was developed by John Shiban and David Amann; the teleplay was written by Amann. Kim Manners helmed the directing of the episode. \\"Release\\" was originally going to be written by Shiban alone, but he later turned the script over to Amann because he was needed elsewhere at the time. Shiban had been desiring to write a story like \\"Release\\" for a while. Shiban and Amman came up with a story in which Scully encounters a \\"genius\\" from her classes at the FBI Academy at Quantico. Later on, they extrapolated on the story, allowing the \\"genius\\" crime solver to help John Doggett find out what happened to his son, Luke Doggett. Hayes was written to be an ambitious character, inspired by the works of Arthur Conan Doyle: he was written to be either a \\"brilliant guy who's solving crimes with his amazing intuition\\", comparable to Sherlock Holmes, or \\"a guy who's actually doing those crimes and playing a game\\", like Professor Moriarty. Robert Patrick called the final scene, in which Doggett and his ex-wife scatter Luke's remains, \\"difficult\\". He later noted that Manners \\"was there to guide us along; I can think of no worst nightmare for a parent than to lose their child.\\"Fraga, p. 221 The episode was written to give closure to Doggett's story. Patrick later said that, if the series had continued for a tenth season, he would have liked to see his character develop a relationship with Reyes, because \\"I think Doggett was very attracted to Reyes [‚Ä¶] I would have liked to see the relationship with Reyes explored more.\\" Gish agreed, noting that the show's ending never allowed the idea to be fleshed out, but that Reyes \\"would have definitely gone further with their relationship.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 208  Reception Ratings= \\"Release\\" first aired in the United States on May 5, 2002, and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on March 9, 2003. The episode's initial broadcast was viewed by approximately 5.38 million households, and 7.8 million viewers.Kessenich, p. 193 It ranked as the fifty- fifth most watched episode of television that aired during the week ending May 5. \\"Release\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 5.1, meaning that it was seen by 5.1% of the nation's estimated households. =Reviews= \\"Release\\" received positive reviews from critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A‚Äì grade. In a season review, Michelle Kung from Entertainment Weekly called the episode \\"worthy\\", but noted that it was overshadowed by the show's \\"ludicrous conspiracy plots\\". Jeffrey Robinson from DVD Talk concluded that \\"Release\\" was a \\"good episode\\" because it \\"presented conclusions to [one of the] long running stories in the series [in that it] featured the conclusion to John Doggett's personal trial, his quest for closure with his son's murder.\\" Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two argued that, because of the \\"minimal emphasis\\" Doggett's son's murder was given in the show, the episode \\"packs [a] punch\\". Shearman and Pearson saw similarities between Doggett's trials and those of Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). They noted that while \\"Mulder was always identified by his quest for his sister [Samantha]\\", Doggett \\"carried the loss of his son as a private grief.\\" They concluded that this structuring made the entry \\"emotionally powerful\\" and \\"moving\\".Shearman and Pearson, pp. 276‚Äì277 M.A. Crang, in his book Denying the Truth: Revisiting The X-Files after 9/11, complimented the \\"lyrical style\\" of the episode, calling it \\"gorgeously shot\\" and \\"well acted\\".

Custody case tricky: He used to be she. St. Petersburg Times Kantaras married Linda Forsythe in a civil ceremony on July 18, 1989 in Holiday, Florida. Kantaras adopted Forsythe's child from a prior relationship, and Forsythe gave birth to a second child through artificial insemination in 1992. Kantaras met another woman and filed for divorce in 1998, requesting primary custody of the children. The divorce was finalized in 1999. Kantaras won his custody case in 2003, following a three-week hearing that featured medical experts who testified that Kantaras should be considered a man.

Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134 (1974), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court rejected a nonprobationary federal civil service employee's claim to a full hearing prior to dismissal. The governing federal law prescribed not only grounds for removal but also removal procedures. The employee could only be removed for \\"cause,\\" but the procedures did not provide for an adversarial hearing.  Background  A federal civil service employee in the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), was fired pursuant to the Lloyd- La Follette Act () after he was found to have recklessly made statements that an officer of the OEO had been involved in bribes. The employee was advised of his rights under regulations promulgated by the Civil Service Commission (Commission) and the OEO on how he could reply to the charges and appeal any subsequent dismissal to the Commission or OEO. Appellee filed suit upon the claim that the discharge procedures authorized by the Act had denied him and others due process of law. The lower court sided with the employee.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court reversed in a plurality opinion. Six of the Justices found that the Lloyd-La Follette Act had created an expectancy of job retention requiring procedural protection under the Due Process Clause. Five of the Justices then concluded that the procedure given the plaintiff satisfied the requirements of Due Process. Furthermore, the Court concluded that post-termination procedures provided by the Commission and the OEO adequately protected appellee's liberty interest in not being wrongfully stigmatized by untrue administrative charges. Finally, the Court held the Lloyd-La Follette Act was not impermissibly vague or overbroad in its regulation of federal employee speech..

They were superseded by the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015. The regulations placed specific duties on clients, designers and contractors, to plan their approach to health and safety. They applied throughout construction projects, from inception to final demolition and removal. They were introduced by the Health and Safety Executive's Construction Division to: * Improve project planning and management; * Assign appropriate personnel to manage on-site risks; * Manage health and safety; * Discourage bureaucracy.  History  CDM 2007 was a result of an EU Directive 92/57/EEC (OJ L245, 26.8.92), the 'Construction Sites Directive'. They came into force on April 6, 2007 and replaced a 1994 predecessor as amended in 2000 and 1996 Health and Safety regulations. They were superseded by the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 2015 with effect from 6 April 2015, with transitional arrangements for existing construction projects to comply with the 2007 regulations until October 2015.  Organization  The regulations were divided into 5 parts: * Interpretation and application * General management duties that applied to all construction projects * Additional management duties that applied to notifiable projects * Physical safeguards that must be provided to prevent danger * Civil liability and transitional provisions that applied during the period when the regulations come into force, and amendments and revocations of other legislation CDM 2007 applied to all construction and covers construction activities such as building, civil engineering, engineering construction work, demolition, site preparation and site clearance.Regulations  Approved Code of Practice 2007 (ACoP)  The HSE's Approved Code of Practice (ACoP) gives practical advice on how to comply with the law. It states that following the advice given complies with CDM regulations. Violation of the health and safety law/code carry legal consequences. ACoP came into force in April 2007. This edition completely re-wrote the original and revised ACoP's that complied with CDM 1994. Notifiable projects Projects are classified as ‚Äònotifiable‚Äô if the construction work phase is expected to last longer than 30 working days and have more than 20 workers working at the same time at any point on the project, or to exceed 500 person days.HSE, Notifications - F10s, accessed 17 July 2020 Under the CDM regulation, the client appoints a competent Principal Contractor and CDM coordinator, who notifies the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) by using Form 10 (F10). Failure to do so means the client must take the duties of Principal Contractor and CDM coordinator assigned to the parties under CDM 2007. Non-notifiable projects are those that are likely to take less than 30 days of construction time. Although there is no legal requirement for a formal appointment of a Principal Contractor or CDM coordinator or a construction phase plan for non-notifiable projects, regulation does require cooperation and coordination between all members of the project team. \\"CDM coordinator\\" is the new title for the Planning Supervisor under CDM 1994, with increased duties and responsibilities. Multiple plan documents must be prepared. * Construction Phase Plan ‚Äì let the building contract, appoint contractor, issue production information, arrange site hand-over, and review contractor‚Äôs proposals * Construction to Practical Completion ‚Äì administer the building contract and provide contractor with further information as necessary * After Practical Completion ‚Äì administer the building contract after practical completion, resolve defects and make final inspections) * Health and Safety File The importance of this phase is in the inspection of expected performance standards to ensure compliance). Additional duties are also placed on the Client, Designers and Contractors. Duty holders Parties with specific duties under the regulations are the client, designer, principal contractor, other contractors, and a new duty holder introduced by the regulations, the ‚ÄòCDM coordinator'. Each of these duty holders, apart from the client, must be \\"competent\\" to act in the project. =Client= The client is the party for whom the project is carried out. The client controls the duration, budget and appointment of other parties. As such they play a key role in the promotion of a systematic approach to health and safety management in construction. The client's legal duties are: * Verify the competence and resources of all organisations and internal teams on the project (e.g., principal contractor, CDM coordinator, designers and contractors). * Ensure suitable management arrangements. * Ensure sufficient time and resources are allowed for all stages including site setup. * With CDM coordinator, compile and provide pre-construction information to designers and contractors. * Ensure cooperation and coordination between client and contractor staff. On notifiable projects the client's additional duties are to: * Select and appoint a competent and resourced CDM coordinator and principal contractor. * Verify the sufficiency of the construction phase plan prior to construction commencement. * Verify that suitable welfare facilities are in place prior to construction commencement and cooperate with the principal contractor to provide a suitable welfare facility * Compile and retain up to date health and safety files from the CDM coordinator. Provide access to others for health and safety purposes. Often, clients have little knowledge of managing a construction project. Clients without construction expertise rely on the CDM coordinator‚Äôs advice on how best to meet their duties. The CDM coordinator needs the client's support and input to work effectively. The client remains responsible for ensuring client duties are met. Domestic clients having work done on a property they intend to live in are exempt from CDM 2007. =CDM coordinator= A CDM coordinator is required only on notifiable projects. Primary roles and duties are to provide the client with an advisor on construction health and safety risk management matters and to ensure compliance with CDM 2007. The legal duties of a CDM coordinator under CDM 2007 are: * Notify notifiable projects to the Health & Safety Executive. * Advise and assist the client with all of their duties. =Designers= In CDM 2007, ‚Äòdesigner‚Äô covers persons or organisations who prepare drawings, design details or specify a particular construction method or material. Therefore, by default anyone involved is a potential designer, including the client, architect, engineers, surveyors, service designers, project managers, landscape architects, contractors, interior designers and shop fitters and anyone purchasing materials without a detailed specification. Designers can identify and eliminate hazards and reduce hazard risks where elimination is not possible. Designer responsibilities extend beyond the construction phase. The must consider the health and safety of those who maintain, repair, clean, refurbish, and eventually remove or demolish the structure, as well as that of workplace users. Where significant risks remain, designers must ensure that the CDM coordinator, other designers and contractors are aware of these risks. Designers also have duties under other legislation. The legal duties of a designer under CDM 2007 are to: * Ensure that the client is aware of the client's duties prior to commencing design work. * Ensure that personnel allocated to their design team from internal or external resources are competent and adequately resourced. * Eliminate or reduce health and safety risks to constructors, users, maintainers, repairers, commissioners, testers, cleaners, demolishers etc. * Work with other designers, including temporary works designers, to ensure adequate design coordination. * Provide information about risks that cannot be satisfactorily addressed to the client, other designers and contractors. On notifiable projects designers' additional duties are to: * Verify that the project has been notified and that the CDM coordinator has been appointed. * Cooperate with the CDM coordinator * Provide information requested by the CDM coordinator for the health and safety file. =Principal Contractor= The principal contractor develops a health and safety plan from the pre-construction information provided by the CDM coordinator and by ensuring that the plan is followed. The principal contractor must be a licensed contractor. A contractor performs/manages construction work and is formally appointed by the client. The principal contractor must also comply with the contractor's duties (below). The principal contractor has prime responsibility for safety and health during the construction phase only on notifiable projects. Duties are to: * Demonstrate competence and adequacy of resources to perform required duties. * Verify competence and resources allocation of any sub-contractors. * Prepare, develop, communicate, implement and amend the construction phase plan. * Plan and manage construction processes. * Manage subcontractors. * Ensure provision of adequate welfare facilities, prevent unauthorised site access, prepare and enforce site rules. * Supply key documents to subcontractors such as health and safety file information, site surveys, designers' information, risk assessments, and the construction phase plan. * Inform subcontractors of their mobilisation time. * Ensure the workforce is consulted on health and safety matters and provided with suitable information and training. * Liaise with the CDM coordinator for any design undertaken during the construction phase. * Provide information for the health and safety file. * Display the project notification on the site. =Contractors= Contractor duties are to: * Ensure that workers under their control are safe. * Ensure that any contractor whom they engage to work is with the permission of the Estates project manager/supervisor and are informed of the amount of time allowed to prepare before starting work. * Provide workers under their control any necessary information, including about relevant aspects of other contractors' work that they need to work safely, to report problems or to respond appropriately in an emergency. * Coordinate their work with others. * Ensure adequate welfare facilities for their workers. In addition, for notifiable projects: * Check that the client is aware of their duties, check that a CDM coordinator has been appointed and ensure that HSE has been notified before the work starts. * Cooperate with the principal contractor in planning and managing work. * Provide details to the principal contractor of contractors they engage. * Provide any information needed for the health and safety file. * Inform the principal contractor of any problems. * Inform the principal contractor of reportable accidents, disease and dangerous events. =Workers= Workers behave as safely as possible and not endanger others. Their duties are to: * Ensure they only carry out tasks at which they are competent. * Report risks and hazards to the contractor. * Coordinate work to ensure the health and safety of themselves and others. * Follow site health and safety rules and procedures. Statutory documents Mandatory documents for a CDM project, include project notification, pre-construction information, construction phase plan and health and safety plan. Pre-construction information is required for all projects, while some form of the other documents must be produced for both notifiable and non-notifiable projects. Project notification is only needed for notifiable projects. The Construction Phase Plan is required on notifiable projects, but something similar is required on other projects to provide for effective health and safety management. The Health and Safety File must be produced by the CDM coordinator on notifiable projects. Existing Health and Safety files must be modified files for structures undergoing modifications. The client must establish related procedures. Even when a Health and Safety File is not required, as-built and operational and maintenance information are required. =Project notification (Form 10)= The regulations require the CDM coordinator to notify the local HSE office of all projects expected to last more than 30 working days and all work of shorter duration that involves more than 500 person-shifts. The initial notification happens as soon as possible after appointment of the CDM coordinator. Further notifications are required by project changes that affects the notification, such as the subsequent appointment of the principal contractor. Additional notifications are not required should designers and contractors change. This notification may be performed using the HSE Form 10(rev) or by other means, including electronic, providing it contains the information specified by Schedule 1 of CDM2007, which consists of: * Date of forwarding and exact site address * A brief project description * Contact details of the client, CDM coordinator and principal contractor * Planned construction start date planned * Time allowed for planning and preparation * Planned construction duration * Estimated maximum number of on-site workers * Planned number of contractors * Name and address of existing designers and contractors * A client declaration attesting knowledge of client duties =Pre-construction information= Pre-construction information (PCI) provides information for planning and for the construction phase plan. The 'pre-construction information' is information regarding the project, site and other relevant issues required by designers and contractors. The pre-construction information may include indexed drawings, reports, surveys, etc., either in digital or hard copy. =Construction phase plan= Construction phase plans (CPP or CPHP) must contain health and safety management systems and arrangements, and risk assessments and method statements for initial work activities. On non-notifiable projects involving demolition or high risk levels, a written plan, approximating the construction phase plan is recommended. The client must establish the need for this, with assistance from designers. The CDM ACoP, Appendix 3 contains a listing of required items. Health and safety file A health and safety file (HSF) is required only on notifiable projects. However, if a health and safety file exists for a structure involved in a non-notifiable project, this file must be updated. The health and safety file contains information needed to allow safe construction. Scope, structure and format must be agreed between the client and the CDM coordinator at the outset. The client takes charge of the file upon project completion. On notifiable projects, contractors must promptly provide relevant information to the principal contractor. The pre-construction information covers contents, timing and format. = File content = *Brief description of the structural / building work *List of residual hazards and how they were addressed, such as information concerning asbestos, contaminated land, water bearing strata, buried services etc. *Description of the structural principles, such as bracing, sources of substantial stored energy *including pre- or post-tensioned members) and safe working loads for floors and roofs *List of hazards associated with materials, such as hazardous substances, lead paint and special coatings *Information regarding the removal or dismantling of installed plant and equipment (for example lifting arrangements) *Information about any cleaning/maintenance equipment *Nature, location, and markings of significant services, including fire-fighting services *Information and as-built drawings of the structures, plant and equipment, such as safe access to service voids and fire exits Key consultation results Public review generated 1427 responses, among the highest of any consultation undertaken by HSE.

Plot Shiang-chyi has returned to Taipei from her trip to Paris. She goes to the skywalk where she first met Hsiao-kang, the salesman who sold her a watch, but some construction has taken place and the skywalk is gone. She stares at a large video screen for a while and then wanders around aimlessly. After crossing a street illegally, she is stopped by a police officer, who checks her ID card. Shiang-chyi then stops at a coffee shop for a short while. She realizes that her card is missing, so she goes back to the officer to ask if he still has it. He replies that he does not. Meanwhile, Hsiao-kang is smoking in a public toilet stall. After he finishes, he washes his hands and leaves the restroom. He then walks up some stairs on the underpass. Shiang-chyi is walking down the same flight of stairs, and they pass each other. Hsiao-kang pauses at the top of the staircase to look back down at her, but Shiang-chyi does not notice him. Hsiao-kang then goes to audition for a new job as a pornographic actor. The director asks him a few questions and then tells him to take off his clothes. Hsiao-kang hesitates but eventually complies. He then puts on a doctor's uniform and steps out onto the balcony to start filming. The short ends with music playing over a scene of clouds moving in real-time. Cast *Chen Shiang-chyi *Lee Kang-sheng *Lu Yi- ching Background Actors Chen Shiang-chyi and Lee Kang-sheng both reprised their roles from Tsai Ming-liang's previous film What Time Is It There? Their characters would also appear in Tsai's next film, The Wayward Cloud.Braester, Yomi. Painting the City Red: Chinese Cinema and the Urban Contract (Duke University Press, 2010), pp. 187-189. One of the principal locations of What Time Is It There? was the skywalk in front of the New Railway Station. The skywalk was torn down after shooting the film, and this short is based on that fact.Laughlin, Charles A. Contested Modernities in Chinese Literature (Macmillan, 2005), p. 157.

It chronicles the adventures of three young girls and their ponies. The main characters of the series are Lucinda (Lulu) Sanders, Anna Harley, and Pam Crandal. The series starts when Lulu moves to the fictional town of Wiggins, and finds a neglected pony named Snow White, who she boards and later owns (after the fourth book). In the first book she becomes friends with Anna and Pam, who have lived in Wiggins all their lives and already have ponies, named Acorn and Lightning. The three girls call themselves the Pony Pals. The books in the series tend to have the girls find a Pony Pals Problem which they solve together, after each girl writes down a suggestion for the problem and they come up with a solution together at a Pony Pals meeting. In 2010, a virtual world based on these books, clubponypals.com, was created, where users may adopt a virtual pony. List of charactersPony Pals= *Lulu Sanders A brunette girl who moved to Wiggins at the start of the series. Her father travels the world researching animals, and her mother died when she was little. Lulu lives with her grandmother, a hairdresser who doesn't like horses. Lulu learned to ride when she lived in England, and also inherited a love of nature and adventure from her father. *Pam Crandal An African-American girl who has grown up around horses and ponies. Her father is a veterinarian and her mother is a riding teacher. Pam knows the most about horses and riding, as well as taking care of other animals. She originally disliked horse shows, despite being a highly capable rider, but over the course of the series she grows to like competitions. *Anna Harley A girl with curly blonde hair who has dyslexia but is an excellent artist. Her father is a firefighter and her mother owns a diner where the Pony Pals often eat and hold meetings. Anna is very clever and is kind, often encouraging the other Pony Pals to help someone. She is also the only Pony Pal that knows how to carriage drive. =Ponies= *Snow White Lulu's pony; a white Welsh pony. Snow White is a beautiful and gentle pony who used to belong to a snobby girl named Rema Baxter. After Lulu saved Snow White from a barbed wire fence, she leased the pony and, later, convinced Rema to sell Snow White to her. *Lightning Pam's pony; a chestnut Connemara pony with a lucky white upside-down heart on her forehead. She is shown to be an excellent jumper, and also protective over other animals, but gets jealous when Pam spends too much time with other ponies. *Acorn Anna's pony; a bay (brown and black) Shetland pony. He is most well known for being cute and mischievous. He originally would not jump for Anna, but, the two of them learned to work together since then. He is very gentle with children, particularly the Junior Pony Pals, Mimi Kline and Rosalie Lacey. =Recurring characters= *Mrs. Crandal Pam's mother. She runs the local riding school. *Dr. Crandall Pam's father, the local veterinarian. *Grandmother Sanders Lulu's grandmother, a hairdresser. *Mrs. Harley Anna's mother.

In other works  A defaced version of Betancourt's novel Detective Pony was featured in the webcomic Homestuck, as a gift given to one of the characters. This inspired an extended fan-edit of the book, which featured extensive re-writing of the story and the inclusion of Betancourt as a self-aware character.

AFHRA document 00055930, 24th Aero Squadron, 1918-1919AFHRA document 00055931, 24th Pursuit Squadron, 1921‚Äì1923AFHRA document 00055915, 24th Fighter Squadron, 1919‚Äì1943 The Great Depression in the United States and lack of funding to the Army Air Service and later Army Air Corps led to the fortunes of the unit being at a rather low ebb by 1 January 1939, at which time the squadron consisted of six flying officers and 93 other ranks, the Squadron was equipped with the Boeing P-26A Peashooter. With the breakout of World War II in Europe during September 1939, the Squadron was one of the first to be brought up to strength when, on 7 September 1939, 25 new Second Lieutenants arrived from Barksdale, Selfridge and Langley Fields in the United States. Between the date of their arrival and the Pearl Harbor Attack on 7 December 1941, 13 of these young officers were reassigned to other Pursuit squadrons in the Canal Zone, and this marked the beginning of a policy whereby most of the Squadrons of the 16th and 32d Pursuit Groups grew, almost literally, out of the 24th Pursuit Squadron. In October 1939, the Squadron received word that it was to re-equip with the new Curtiss P-36A Hawks. By the end of 1939, the Squadron was \\"up to strength,\\" with 12 P-36A's (the Squadron color was yellow at the time), one Captain (the Squadron Commander), 11 Second Lieutenants and 142 enlisted ranks. The year 1940 passed in an endless series of training maneuvers, and personnel replacements and reassignments. Due to training accidents, as of 31 December 1940, the unit had but eight of its P-36A's left, and officer strength had dwindled to one Captain, one First Lieutenant and six Second Lieutenants, but enlisted strength had grown to 158. In June 1941, the Squadron received nine new Curtiss P-40C Warhawks and, with these, a number of long-range navigational flights were undertaken, one going so far as Trinidad.

The remainder of the Squadron moved to the La Joya #2 Aerodrome on 12 March 1942, where they remained until returning to Albrook on 30 September, having been re-designated as the 24th Fighter Squadron on 15 May. For the first four months that the unit was at La Joya #2, they had operated off the very primitive dirt runway there. This field was 25 miles north east of Albrook, just off the main Pan- American Highway to Chepo. It was, however, well situated as, just off the runway was heavy jungle growth, which offered excellent revetments and camouflage. The unit had also transitioned from its P-40C's to Bell P-39D Airacobras starting 2 May 1942, when it acquired 10 of these aircraft From the 53d Fighter Group. The field at La Joya became flooded (due to the rainy season) in September 1942, forcing the return of the unit, somewhat ahead of schedule, to Albrook, where conditions were very crowded. By then, the P-39D's had been exchanged for 14 P-39K's. On 15 October 1942, eight P-39K's were dispatched on a mission near Rio Hato to graphically illustrate the effectiveness of the cannon-armed fighter as a ground-attack aircraft. The Airacobras attacked a column of derelict trucks positioned there and, when the dust settled, all but five of the 115 vehicles had been completely destroyed. In addition, between November 1942 and 11 January 1943, the Squadron also had a solitary Douglas P-70 night fighter, which it maintained and operated on behalf of the XXVI Fighter Command at Albrook. This was the rather weak Sixth Air Force response to a concern over the lack of night fighter defenses for the Panama Canal. The respite at Albrook was short-lived, however, as it had now become the policy of Sixth Air Force to rotate its Fighter Squadrons in and out of remote bases for practical as well as for morale purposes. Thus, on 17 January 1943, (with a total of 17 aircraft on hand) the Squadron took up residence again at La Joya #2, following the arrival of the dry season, where it stayed until 28 May, when it returned once again, briefly, to Albrook. However, just prior to the return to Albrook on 24 May, 12 P-39K's flew in support of three Navy PT Boats in a simulated dive-bombing and strafing attack on two Navy Destroyers some 10 miles south east of Taborquilla Island. The next move, however, was to Howard Field (after being yet again flooded out at La Joya), on 9 June 1943, although Flight \\"E\\" was detached to serve on Rey Island in the Bay of Panama on 15 June (Punta Coco Airfield,at southern tip la Esmeralda peninsula). Also, the Squadron, for reasons unknown, received four P-39D's which had previously been stationed at Losey Field, Puerto Rico. Fortunately, however, the Squadron flew its last P-39 missions on 25 June 1943 and, ironically, these were replaced on 27 June 1943 by two refurbished Curtiss P-40C's and on 29 June two new P-40N Warhawks. From that point through until August, the Squadron transitioned into new P-40N's, 22 of which were on hand by the end of that month. Meanwhile, the detachment at Rey Island (\\"E\\" Flight) was joined by \\"F\\" Flight, and these were amalgamated into one very large \\"E\\" Flight, still on Rey Island. On 27 August 1943, flying their new P-40N's, \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" Flights flew a most interesting mass cross-country to Costa Rica. The next day, they flew down the Atlantic side of the Isthmus of Panama ‚Äì completely undetected ‚Äì and made a successful surprise \\"attack\\" on the Gatun Locks of the Panama Canal. \\"B\\" Flight made three dive-bombing attacks from 10,000 feet while \\"A\\" Flight made four strafing passes. Defending interceptors, finally alerted to the proceedings, didn't show up until the attack was completely over. Effective 1 November 1943, the Squadron was officially assigned directly to the XXVI Fighter Command and, by 31 December, had totally re-equipped with P-4ON's.AFHRA document 00055933, 24th Fighter Squadron, 1943‚Äì1945 The Squadron was moved again to Madden Army Airfield (near Madden Dam) on 8 March 1944 and, shortly following, again re-equipped, this time with Bell P-39Q-5's and P-39Q-20's, and Piper L-4s and North American AT-6 Texans were also assigned. A \\"hack\\" Northrop RA-17 as well as a Curtiss RP-40C and a North American AT-6D were also assigned. By March a single Vultee BT-13A Valiant had also been added, to augment the instrument training program. In July 1944, the Squadron was once again tasked to make mock attacks on Panama Canal installations and, later in the same month, conducted very intensive interceptor exercises against various VI Bomber Command elements. By the end of that month, 23 P-39Q's were on hand, of which 21 were combat ready. AFHRA document 00002497, History of Madden Field, Panama, 1944 On 15 August 1944, the Squadron moved again, this time to France Field and, by October, the unit had reached perhaps its highest state of combat readiness, with 23 of 24 P-39Q's airworthy, the highest percentage in XXVI Fighter Command at the time. By January 1945, the unit had been formally redesignated as the 24th Fighter Squadron (Twin Engine) and this signaled the advent of the sleek Lockheed P-38 Lightning into Squadron service. The first P-38 known assigned was P-38J 44-23072, which also suffered a landing accident on 25 February 1945. The Squadron moved once again, although the main body was still stationed at France Field, this time to Chame Field, Panama, and by March 1945 had a mixed strength consisting of 16 P-39Qs, 11 P-38Js, and single examples of the Cessna UC-78, North American AT-6F (44-82129) and a Vultee BT-13A (42-42753). By June 1945, the P-38 Lightnings predominated, with 20 P-38s on hand and but five P-39Qs, although one of the P-38s was lost that month to an accident, the earlier P-38J's having been augmented by P-38Ls (including 43-50301 and 50318). A Beech UC-45F (44-87029) was also assigned to the Squadron to serve as a conversion trainer to twin-engined equipment, augmenting the UC-78.AFHRA document 00055919, 24th Fighter Squadron, 1945 With the end of the war in September 1945, the squadron reduced its activities, and many personnel were transferred back to the United States for separation. The squadron was placed in an inactive status on 1 November 1945, and formally inactivated on 15 October 1946. Its remaining aircraft were transferred to the 43d Fighter Squadron.AFHRA document 00055927, 24th Fighter Squadron, 1945 =Heraldry= A leaping tiger in the proper colors.

The first generation of trams in Luxembourg ran from 1875 to 1964, before being withdrawn from service and the tramways removed. A second generation of trams began operational service in December 2017, along a new route that will, by 2021, run from Luxembourg Airport to the Cloche d'Or business district. Contemporary and future usage Planned route of the new tramline (in French) Luxembourg is in the process of reintroducing trams to its transport infrastructure. Construction work begun on a new tram depot on the edge of the Gr√ºnewald Forest and the Kirchberg quarter of Luxembourg City in January 2015, with the first tracks being laid in July 2016. The tramline, when fully operational, will have 24 stations connected by 16 km of tracks and have a capacity of 10,000 passengers per hour in each direction. Trams provided by the Spanish company CAF began trials on the first phase of the route in July 2017. Opened on 10 December 2017, the first phase of the route saw trams run from the depot, along Avenue John F. Kennedy, past the European district, the location of many EU institutions, before terminating at the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge. Here, a new funicular railway was opened on the same date allowing passengers to descend to Pfaffenthal-Kirchberg railway station for access to national and international heavy rail services running through the Pfaffenthal valley. In operation as of 27 July 2018, the second phase sees tram services extend across the Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge to Place de l'√âtoile in the Limpertsberg quarter. The third phase, to be completed between 2019 and 2020, will see trams extend into the historical Ville Haute quarter, across the Adolphe Bridge and on to Luxembourg railway station for interchanges between national and international heavy rail services, before terminating in Bonnevoie. Work to widen and re-enforce the Adolphe Bridge, first opened in 1903, to accommodate the tramway was completed in July 2017, with a new cycle and pedestrian lane suspended beneath the existing bridge. The fourth and final stage of the route, due to be completed in 2021, will see tram services extend southwestwards from Bonnevoie to Howald, terminating at the new business district in Cloche d'Or. Concurrently, the tramline will also extend eastwards from the tram depot in the Kirchberg district to Senningerberg before terminating at Luxembourg Airport. In June 2018, the Minister for Sustainable Development and Infrastructure, Fran√ßois Bausch, announced that exploratory work had been undertaken for a possible future extension of the tramline alongside the A4 motorway to Foetz by 2028, and onto Luxembourg's second most populous city, Esch-sur-Alzette, by 2035. Trams would be expected to reach speeds of up to 100 km/h when traveling through rural sections of the route in a similar fashion to most light rail lines. Luxembourg City mayor Lydie Polfer confirmed in 2020 that there are plans to extend the tram line to Strassen. = Trams = Twenty-one CAF Urbos trams were delivered in 2017, with a further twelve ordered in 2018.

Historical usage and museum The last of the first generation of tramways in Luxembourg, seen here in 1964. Luxembourg's first horse-drawn tram line began operations in 1875 running through Luxembourg City along a 10 km line. Electrification followed in 1908. The original track followed a route from Luxembourg railway station through the city centre to Limpertsberg. It was extended to various parts of the city until 1930 when the network covered 31 km. Several lines were closed at the beginning of the 1960s as buses replaced the trams. The last tram ran on the line to Beggen on 5 September 1964. The country's other tram network designated Tramways Intercommunaux du Canton d'Esch served Esch- sur-Alzette and its surroundings from 1927 to 1956. A number of historic trams can be seen at Luxembourg City's tram and bus museum located on Rue de Bouillon in Hollerich. In particular, the museum exhibits two electric trams, two tram coaches, and a replica of a horse tram. There are also numerous models and photographs.

It has been a principal crop of Haiti ever since. Alongside sugar, coffee long formed the backbone of early Haiti's economy. At the present-day, coffee has fallen behind both mango and cocoa in terms of export value. History Coffee cultivation was first introduced to Haiti in 1715, as hardier plants from Martinique was later brought in and further developed. The story of de Clieu's introduction of coffee comes from his account in the Ann√©e litt√©raire of 1774. According to this account, he arranged to transport a coffee plant (or perhaps several) from the greenhouses of the Jardin royal des plantes (which had originally received two plants from Holland in the 1710s) to Martinique in 1720.Lacour, p. 235f. Lacour quotes dispatches mentioning de Clieu's \\"soins...pour la culture du caf√© et pour sa distribution dans la colonie\\", but not its introduction. According to de Clieu's account, water was rationed on the voyage, and he shared his ration with the seedlings. The story is repeated in many histories of coffee.Henri Welter, Essai sur l'histoire du caf√©, Paris, 1868 full text at Internet Archive, p. 20. However, a recent history points out that though it may well be true that de Clieu brought a seedling to Martinique, and perhaps even that he shared his water ration with it, coffee was already growing in the Western Hemisphere: in the French colony of Saint-Domingue since 1715 and in the Dutch colony of Surinam since 1718. As a former French colony, coffee was first cultivated in Haiti (then Saint-Domingue) from 1734, and by 1788 it supplied half the world's coffee. The conditions that the slaves worked in on coffee plantations were a factor in the soon to follow Haitian Revolution that broke out in 1791. By 1801, most plantations were burnt down. Haitian revolutionary Toussaint Louverture attempted to revive the production that declined 45% from 1789 levels and instituted a fermage system, similar to serfdom; confined to state-owned plantations. However, when Napoleon began to send troops between 1801¬ñ‚Äì1803 in a failed attempt to regain the territory, the coffee plantations were again abandoned. When learning of the final defeat of his troops in 1803, Napoleon angrily shouted, \\"Damn coffee!\\" Damn colonies!\\". In 1920, Vice President of the National City Bank, John H. Allen, wrote about Haiti in \\"The Americas\\" and said: > Up to two years ago, Haitian coffee was never wanted in this market, whereas > in Europe it was in strong demand. Recently, a demand has developed here for > this excellent grade of coffee, which when properly prepared, is superior to > the majority of other grades. Coffee production has been hurt by natural disasters, as well as United States-led embargoes against the governments of Fran√ßois and Jean-Claude Duvalier. Duvalier's dictatorship made it so that the coffee farmers of Haiti were too afraid to come down from the mountains to sell their crops. The machinery began to rust and the skills needed to harvest the coffee trees were lost in the generations. Following the movement away from Haitian coffee production, Brazil moved in and took control of the world coffee market. With brief comebacks in 1850 where coffee was a major export of Haiti, or in 1949 when it rose to the world's third major producer, the market has continued to go through continuous boom and bust cycles. Haiti's coffee competitiveness suffered internationally. The continuous shifts in the coffee market lead to Haitians burning their coffee trees in order to make charcoal, hoping that would improve economic wealth. When Haiti was a main world contributor of coffee, 80 percent of the labour force was involved in agriculture. In the 1980s the percent of the population that was involved in agriculture dropped to 66. Those who were not involved in the agricultural aspect of the crop still took part in the production of coffee through marketing, or being middlemen or exporters. In the 21st century, agriculture was penalized due to difficult climatic conditions. Haiti has suffered from soil erosion as well as deforestation, which affect the growth of coffee crops. In addition to ongoing cycles of floods and droughts, Haiti has been the victim of many natural disasters. In 2010, Haiti was hit by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake that left the country in desolation and played a big role in the decrease of coffee production. However, the continual rise in demand has eased Haiti back into the world coffee scene through the implementation of fair trade policies that have contributed to its attempt at restoration. The profile of Haitian coffee has grown and has been advantageous for small-scale Haitian farmers as specialty coffee has drawn the attention of a growing trend of socially-aware western consumers receiving a premium on the world market stage adopting strategies that has heightened its value, such as origin-labeling, high quality differentiation techniques such as fair trade, gourmet, and organic, in order to meet these demands and capitalizing on their higher willingness to pay.

A precursor to the present nine-mile road was first built in 1916, but was later redesigned by the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Designs to highlight the natural features of the valley while presenting a natural-appearing built environment. The road begins at the south boundary of the park and ends at the Temple of Sinawava. Map of the road in Zion Canyon The design uses local materials such as red sandstone and rustic construction techniques according to the prevailing 1930s Park Service policy of naturalistic design. The Cable Creek Bridge is separately nominated to the National Register of Historic Places as a particularly prominent example of the style. The road surface is coated with red aggregate to continue the design theme. From the South Entrance to Canyon Junction at the mouth of Zion Canyon the road has been reconstructed and has lost many of the characteristic features of the 1930s construction. The original 1916 road, built by Park Service engineer W.O. Tufts, was a single- lane dirt road that extended as far as the Weeping Rock parking area. In 1925 a gravel-surfaced road, called the \\"Government Road\\" replaced the original road and extended all the way to the Temple of Sinawava. In 1931 and 1932 the present road was constructed on a new alignment as a Depression-era public works project. Further construction was performed from 1933 to 1942 by Civilian Conservation Corps labor. Traffic restrictions Traffic congestion in the narrow canyon was recognized as a major problem in the 1990s and a public transportation system using propane-powered shuttle buses was instituted in the year 2000. From April through October, the scenic drive in Zion Canyon is closed to private vehicles and visitors ride the shuttle buses.NPS website, Green Transit - The Zion Shuttle See also *Zion-Mount Carmel Highway ReferencesExternal links * Category:Civilian Conservation Corps in Utah Category:Roads on the National Register of Historic Places in Utah Category:Transportation in Washington County, Utah Category:Historic American Engineering Record in Utah Category:National Register of Historic Places in Washington County, Utah Category:National Register of Historic Places in Zion National Park ","title":"Floor of the Valley Road"},{"id":"21777123","text":"Mass Appeal is a 1984 American Comedy-Drama directed by Glenn Jordan and starring Jack Lemmon. The screenplay by Bill C. Davis is based on his 1980 play of the same name. Plot For years, as pastor of an affluent, suburban Catholic parish, Father Tim Farley has maintained a close relationship with his congregation by delivering folksy homilies filled with practical advice and adhering to clerical policies without waver. One Sunday, his sermon is interrupted by seminarian Mark Dolson, who questions Farley's position on the ordination of women. The older priest charmingly sidesteps the young man but is annoyed that he was placed in an uncomfortable position. This is a man who relies on charm, harmless white lies, and inane jokes when interacting with his parishioners, and he always has been careful not to get involved in controversial issues. Dolson defends two seminarians who were expelled after being suspected of engaging in a homosexual relationship. After he is ordained a deacon, frustrated Monsignor Thomas Burke assigns him to Farley's parish in the hope the older man will inspire him to toe the line and become more complacent. Although in some ways conservative‚Äîhe criticizes his sister Liz for her affair with a married man‚Äîthe young man primarily is a liberal firebrand who is anxious to make changes in the church, whereas Farley prefers study with a bottle of alcohol and not make waves. The pastor tries to become a mentor to his new charge, but Dolson ignores the priest's efforts to teach him the necessity of tact. He enrages the congregation with his first, highly critical sermon. Questions as to why Dolson defended the gay seminarians arise. He confides having spent two years engaging in sexual relations with both men and women, saying he now is committed to celibacy. Farley urges him to keep quiet about his past, but the deacon admits his secret to the monsignor and is expelled. Farley promises to convince his followers that the church needs liberal thinkers who don't always do things by the book. As soon as he senses he is losing support, however, the priest backs down. Dolson angrily confronts him with a feeling of betrayal, forcing Farley to rethink his position and do the right thing, even if it means the loss of his parish. Cast *Jack Lemmon - Father Tim Farley *≈Ωeljko Ivanek - Deacon Mark Dolson *Charles Durning - Monsignor Thomas Burke *Louise Latham - Margaret *Talia Balsam - Liz Dolson Critical reception Janet Maslin of The New York Times compared the film to Educating Rita, although she found it to be \\"less strident . . . and more prone to dry humor.\\" She added, \\"The momentum of Mr. Davis's drama and the stars' intensity are enough to sustain interest, even when Glenn Jordan's television-style direction seems excessively bland. The casting of the two key roles works in the long run, but it initially seems a shade off. Father Farley, as written, is rather too self-satisfied and facile for the priesthood, qualities better emphasized in Milo O'Shea's stage performance than in Mr. Lemmon's on film, since the character's glibness comes too close to the actor's usual screen persona. And Mr. Ivanek, beginning on a note of intelligence and severity, later has moments of surprisingly callowness, even petulance. But the stars work together very effectively, making the story's progress believable as each of their characters evolves into a better man. Mass Appeal doesn't have to tug too hard at the audience's heartstrings to arrive at its simple and satisfying resolution.\\"New York Times review ReferencesExternal links * * Category:1984 films Category:1984 comedy-drama films Category:1984 LGBT-related films Category:American comedy- drama films Category:American films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:Films scored by Bill Conti Category:Films about Catholic priests Category:Films about Catholicism Category:American films based on plays Category:Films directed by Glenn Jordan Category:Universal Pictures films Category:LGBT-related comedy-drama films ","title":"Mass Appeal (film)"},{"id":"21777126","text":"\\"Badlaa\\" is the tenth episode of the eighth season of the American science fiction television series The X-Files. It premiered on the Fox network on . The episode was written by John Shiban and directed by Tony Wharmby. \\"Badlaa\\" is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. The episode received a Nielsen rating of 7.3 and was viewed by 11.8 million viewers. Overall, the episode received mostly negative reviews from critics. The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)‚Äîfollowing the alien abduction of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)‚Äîwho work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. When a mystic smuggles himself out of India, Scully and Doggett give chase as his murderous spree starts terrorising two families in suburban Washington, D.C. But Scully soon comes upon a crisis of faith when she realises how dissimilar her techniques are from those of Mulder, even as she tries to be the believer. \\"Badlaa\\" was inspired by stories of Indian fakirs as well as the idea of someone asking for money actually being \\"a bad guy.\\" Gurdeep Roy, a noted stuntman better known as Deep Roy, was chosen to play the part of the antagonistic beggar. The episode's title means \\"vengeance\\" or \\"revenge\\" in Hindi. Plot At the Sahar International Airport in Mumbai, India, an obese American businessman dismissively makes his way past a paraplegic beggar. Later, while using the airport's toilet, the businessman is pulled out of the stall violently by the beggar that he passed earlier. Later, the businessman checks into a Washington, D.C., hotel and sits down on his bed. Soon, blood streams out of his bodily orifices. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrives late to the crime scene and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) tells her that the man's blood all drained abruptly in the hotel. A child's bloody print is found, but Scully doesn't believe that a child did this. Meanwhile, the beggar, somehow disguised as an ordinary-looking Caucasian man, applies for a janitorial job at a Cheverly, Maryland, elementary school. In the morgue, Scully describes the massive stomach damage done to the body which leads Doggett to the idea of drugs being forcibly cut out of him. However, the man showed no sign of drugs in the blood tests and Scully tells Doggett that his time of death was 24 to 36 hours prior, long before he left India. Due to a discrepancy in weight, she begins to believe that there was a passenger in the corpse. Quinton, a student at the school mentioned before, calls his father up to his room after he sees the legless beggar man at night. His father tells him that he imagined it. The father goes back downstairs, but then screams. Quinton rushes down and finds his dad dead, his eyes dripping blood. Doggett and Scully investigate this latest death after the police tell them about the strange man the boy saw. While discussing the lack of any damage to the body except the broken blood vessels in the eyes, Scully comes to the conclusion that the man is still inside the latest victim. She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy's father with a distended belly. She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the scalpel incision. After being knocked over, she follows a bloody trail to a storage closet, but finds no one inside. Having turned invisible to Scully, the beggar watches her. At the school, the principal tells the janitor that she was very worried when he did not show up that morning. Trevor, a bully who had previously tormented Quinton, sees through the beggar's janitor guise. Trevor later goes to Quinton's home to apologize and tell him who he thinks killed his father. Scully and Doggett consult Chuck Burks, an old friend of Fox Mulder's, who tells the two that Siddhi mystics could do the things Scully described; the mystics have powers of the mind and can alter people's perceptions of reality. Scully theorizes that a mystic is seeking revenge for an American chemical plant that inadvertently released a gas cloud that killed 118 people in Vishi, outside of Mumbai. One victim was the 11-year-old son of a holy man of the beggar caste. Trevor runs home after hearing the squeaking wheels of the beggar's dolly. Trevor's mother follows him outside to find him face-down in their pool. She dives in to get him, but his form turns into the beggar. At the scene of the crime, the real Trevor tells Scully that it was the \\"little man\\" who killed his mother. Quinton and Trevor hunt the beggar at school. Eventually, the beggar takes the form of Trevor. When Scully arrives, she hesitantly fires at the boy, wounding the beggar and reverting him back to his true form. Two weeks later in Sahar International Airport, the beggar, unharmed, watches another obese American man pass by. Production right The title of \\"Badlaa\\"‚Äîwhich was written by John Shiban and inspired by stories of Indian fakirs‚Äîmeans \\"to retort\\" or \\"to revenge\\" in Urdu. Shiban was also inspired when he wondered: \\"What if someone who came up to me and asked me for money was actually a bad guy?\\" Shiban later noted that his early drafts of the episode featured the antagonist \\"with no legs who can actually shrink himself and climb inside your ear\\". Carter vetoed the idea and suggested that it be revised.Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 189 Shiban later said that \\"... one thing about this episode that I'm sort of proud is that people often have told me that it is the most disgusting thought that they ever had, that this little man would actually enter your body and travel around inside you.\\" The scenes featuring the Indian airport were filmed at a cruise line terminal in Long Beach, California. Ilt Jones, the location manager for the series, felt that the \\"dated feel\\" of the terminal added to the scene. He noted, \\"if you look at newsreel footage of India, they always have old English cars from the sixties, the cruise line terminal in Long Beach was perfect.\\" Casting director Rick Millikan was tasked with finding a suitable actor to play the part of the beggar. Millikan's only instructions were to look for \\"a small all-Indian man with no legs.\\" Eventually, Gurdeep Roy, better known as Deep Roy was chosen to play the part. Deep Roy was a noted stunt man who had notably played Droopy McCool of the Max Rebo Band in Return of the Jedi. Deep Roy, however, is not an amputee and so a cart with a false bottom was created. Anytime there was a scene where the beggar had to move, blue screen technology was used to add the background in during post-production. The cart featured a distinct \\"squeak\\" that Paul Rabwin described as \\"creepy\\". He noted, \\"There was a squeak that had to let us know that it was him. It had to scare us [...] Finally we came up with what we thought was just the right squeak and John [Shiban] said 'Okay, that's the one.'\\" Producer Paul Rabwin was displeased with the final episode, noting, \\"'Badlaa' was the one episode I did not like the most [...] I think if I had done it different, I would have had John Shiban change the method of transportation. I don't think it ever worked on any level for me. It was just weird and creepy, but I think the whole idea was distasteful to me.\\" He later bluntly concluded that \\"it's the only episode that I kind of wish we hadn't done.\\"Fraga, p. 173 Reception \\"Badlaa\\" first aired on Fox on 21 January 2001. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7.3, meaning that it was seen by 7.3% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 7.46 million households and 11.8 million viewers. The episode ranked as the 50th most-watched episode for the week ending January 21. The episode subsequently debuted in the United Kingdom on the BBC Two on May 12, 2002. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"Imagine a man who can squeeze into a shoebox... a suitcase... or a victim.\\" Critical reception to the episode was mostly negative. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode a \\"C\\" and criticized the episode's plot holes, such as how the beggar escaped back to India after being shot by Scully. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five. The two noted that the episode was \\"best\\" when \\"it's at its most tasteless\\", citing the beggar \\"crawling up the bottom of an obese man\\" as \\"pretty tasteless\\". Shearman and Pearson, however, noted that it suffered from the fact that \\"it doesn't have the courage of its convictions\\".Shearman and Pearson, p. 237 Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"C+\\", calling it \\"a messy episode\\". She argued that it is an example of \\"magnificently bad television\\". This in turn, makes it somewhat entertaining; VanDerWerff argued that she would \\"rather watch this episode several times than I would some of those season seven outings where everybody seemed like they would rather be just about anywhere else.\\" However, she did compliment the episode's gross-out scares, noting that the beginning was \\"a pretty great cold open\\". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, was extremely critical of the episode. Referring to it as the series' \\"nadir\\", he ridiculed the plot and sarcastically labeled the main villain \\"Butt Munch\\".Kessenich, p. 146 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one star out of four. Vitaris, sardonically referring to the episode as \\"The X(enophobic)-Files\\", noted that while \\"the butt-crawler is new, the plot is pure \\"X-Files generic Monster-of-the-Week.\\" Matt Hurwitz and Chris Knowles noted in their book The Complete X-Files that the episode soon became known as the \\"'Butt Genie' episode\\" among fans. Despite the negativity, several reviews wrote positively of the episode's antagonistic beggar. Both TV Guide and UGO Networks listed him amongst the greatest monster-of-the-week characters in The X-Files. The UGO review, in particular, noted that the character was \\"One of the series' more blatant allegories [...], as a legless Indian Mystic [...] literally climbs into his victims to travel where he will. [...] Scully and Doggett investigate the bloody goings-on [...] and a gut-wrenching climax, though not entirely successful, still opens up some thorny issues over how we view weakness, deformity, race, and 'otherness.'

It premiered on the Fox network on . The episode was written by Jeffrey Bell and directed by Rod Hardy. \\"Salvage\\" is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. The episode received a Nielsen rating of 7.1 and was viewed by 11.7 million viewers. Overall, the episode received largely negative reviews from critics. The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)‚Äîfollowing the alien abduction of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)‚Äîwho work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Doggett and Scully encounter a dead man who is still living‚Äîonly somewhat changed. What they discover is a man made of metal, enacting vengeance on those he believes created him. \\"Salvage\\" was loosely based on Tetsuo: The Iron Man, a 1989 Japanese cyberpunk film by cult-film director Shinya Tsukamoto. Written by Jeffrey Bell before Robert Patrick was cast as agent Doggett, the film coincidentally echoes the plot of the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day, which Patrick starred in. Indeed, the episode contains an explicit reference to Patrick's role, written in homage. The episode contained several elaborate special effects sequences, most notably in the teaser, wherein a man stops a car with his body. Plot In Muncie, Indiana, Nora Pearce and Curtis Delario argue about the death of her husband, Ray. Nora believes Ray died from Gulf War syndrome. After attempting to comfort her, Delario starts to drive home and crashes into a man in the middle of the road. His car is totaled, but the man is unharmed as the car breaks around his body. Curtis, grievously injured, looks up at the man and says, ‚ÄúRay?‚Äù The man‚Äôs arm slams through the windshield as Curtis screams. Agents Scully and Doggett investigate the crash. Scully suggests a man stopped the car but Doggett points out that it would have required a dense block of steel to stop the car. Nora Pearce appears and asks what happened to Curtis Delario. Soon afterwards, Scully finds Delario‚Äôs body left in a garbage can nearby; his face has gaping holes in it. Autopsying the remains, Scully concludes that the five holes in the man‚Äôs face were made by human fingers, as someone reached into Delario‚Äôs head and pulled him out of the wrecked vehicle. Doggett finds a fresh fingerprint with the blood of Ray. Then Doggett goes to see Nora Pearce and finds Harry Odell, who employed Ray Pearce at his salvage yard. Doggett asks about Ray, but Nora insists she saw Ray die; both do not believe that Ray could be involved in Curtis‚Äôs death. Later, Ray Pearce eats at a halfway house as volunteer, Larina Jackson, bothers him. She tries to reach out to help him but he is completely uninterested in talking with her. Meanwhile, at the salvage yard, Odell is shredding documents when Ray appears. Harry feigns friendliness while he gets the shotgun out of his desk drawer. He blasts Ray through a sliding glass door. Ray‚Äôs detached arm begins to rebuild itself with metal. Harry is transfixed by this sight as Ray kills him. The next morning, Doggett checks out the new murder scene and finds an interesting shredded document. Doggett goes to Chamber Technologies and learns about \\"smart metals\\"‚Äîmetals that rebuild their original forms but are still a metallurgist‚Äôs pipe dream at the moment. On the phone, Doggett mentions the \\"smart metals\\" and Scully tells Doggett about how Ray Pearce‚Äôs medical records show his whole cellular structure was changing due to exposure to an unknown substance. Meanwhile, Larina sees Ray‚Äôs obituary in the paper and is watching the television news story about the murder at the salvage yard. She decides to call Ray‚Äôs widow. Scully discusses Ray Pearce with Doggett. Scully wonders: if Pearce has become a 'metal man' \\"how can he be stopped?\\" Pearce later arrives at Chamber Technologies. Dr. Pugovel, one of the scientists working there, lures him into a containment chamber and then Doggett, Scully, and SWAT team members surround it. He eventually tears his way out of the back of the chamber. Nora waits for Ray in the halfway house. Ray explains that he didn‚Äôt come home because he isn‚Äôt himself anymore. Ray turns angrily to her and says, \\"They've got to pay for this. They've all got to pay.\\" Doggett, searching in the salvage yard, finds a Chamber Technologies drum, inside of which is a metal corpse. When Scully and Doggett confront Pugovel about it, he admits it was Dr. Clifton, a doctor who mysteriously disappeared. He had requested that he be put in the barrel in order to not ruin the company or slow the research. Doggett and Scully realize that Ray was exposed to the barrel, and thus was transformed into a metal human. At the same time, Doggett notices Nora Pearce at the lab, looking through files for the person responsible. Later, the halfway house is raided by the FBI to find Pearce. Larina finds Ray and he puts one hand over her mouth to muffle, but he kills her by accident. When Nora arrives home, Ray shows up demanding the name of the person responsible. She tells him that the man responsible is Owen Harris. Ray finds Harris, along with his family, and nearly kills him. However, he realizes that Harris was an accountant who accidentally sent the barrel to the salvage yard. Seeing that he was ultimately innocent, Ray spares him and goes off to die. Scully believes that this act represented the last of Ray‚Äôs humanity. At the very end of the episode, a car is dropped into a compactor at a salvage yard and crushed. As the camera fades out, Ray's eye is seen, still alive as the car is crushed. Production right =Writing= \\"Salvage\\" was written by X-Files staff writer Jeffrey Bell and was \\"loosely\\" based on Tetsuo: The Iron Man, a 1989 Japanese cyberpunk film by cult-film director Shinya Tsukamoto. The idea to write an episode about a man whose body is made completely out of \\"dense metal alloys\\" was developed by Bell before actor Robert Patrick joined the show. Robert Patrick had previously played the role of a liquid-metal T-1000 android assassin in the 1991 film Terminator 2: Judgment Day. In fact, Patrick had been cast as Agent Doggett by the executives in a hope that his role in the movie would appeal to the 18‚Äì34 male demographic, upon which advertising prices are based. Fox had anticipated a 10 percent increase in viewership with the addition of Patrick.Kessenich, p. 144 Indeed, the episode contains an explicit reference to Patrick's role, written in homage: after hearing Scully's theory, Doggett replies, \\"What‚Äôre you saying? Ray Pearce has become some kind of metal man? 'Cause that only happens in the movies, Agent Scully.\\" With the filming and airing of \\"Salvage\\", Robert Patrick began to feel \\"comfortable in his new role\\". He later recalled that \\"we started seeing our [ratings] numbers. Our numbers were good, and everyone was happy.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 189 Several of the characters and locations were named or based after real individuals and places. The three scientists: Chamber, Clifton, and Pugovel, were named after friends of Bell's, who were engineers. Much of the action was based in Muncie, Indiana. Bell picked this location because it was the hometown of his grandparents. =Effects= In the episode, Ray Pearce, the metal man, was required to stop a car by himself. In order to create this effect, Wade Williams, the actor who played the metal man, was filmed against a green screen. To create the illusion of being hit by a car, the lighting was dropped and a gust of wind from fans occurred at the moment of the supposed impact. The scene was shot at different speeds, a matte was cut, and various effects, like shattering glass and smoke, were overlaid onto the cut footage. A separate scene, featuring a car hitting a green post was then filmed. The two separate images were then composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin later described the scene as \\"effective\\". =Music= A theme from Grieg's Piano Concerto in A Minor is heard multiple times during the episode. Reception \\"Salvage\\" first aired on Fox on January 14, 2001. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7.1, meaning that it was seen by 7.1% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 7.26 million households, and 11.7 million viewers. It ranked as the 54th most-watched episode for the week ending January 14. Subsequently, it debuted in the United Kingdom on the BBC Two on May 5, 2002. Critical reception to the episode was largely negative. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode an F and criticized the episode's plot and, most notably, its ending. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two noted that the episode diluted the characters of Doggett and Scully in a \\"mechanical plot\\", writing \\"'Salvage' would never have made a great episode, but if it had only bothered to give a little more depth to Doggett and Scully, it might still have been an entertaining one.\\"Shearman and Pearson, p. 236 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris referred to the episode as an \\"assembly line monster-of-the-week episode\\" and criticized it for failing to make the audience truly empathetic to Ray Pearce's plight. However, Vitaris did praise the make-up in the episode, noting that \\"that makeup is [Wade Andrew] William's performance [‚Ä¶] he is an astonishing sight.\\" Not all reviews were so negative. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B‚Äì\\". She applauded the way the guest star was allowed to \\"take over\\" the episode, but felt that the de-emphasis on Scully and Doggett rendered their scenes \\"boring\\". Ultimately, VanDerWerff noted that the problem with it was that the two halves of the story‚ÄîDogget and Scully investigation, and Ray's plight‚Äîwere largely unconnected.

It premiered on the Fox network on . The episode was written by Greg Walker and directed by Terrence O'Hara. \\"Surekill\\" is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. The episode received a Nielsen rating of 8.0 and was viewed by 13.3 million viewers. Overall, the episode received largely negative reviews from critics. The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)‚Äîfollowing the alien abduction of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)‚Äîwho work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, the fatal shooting of a realtor, while alone in a cinderblock jail cell, has Doggett struggling to find out who committed the murder and how the crime was committed. Scully and Doggett, however, soon learn that there is more to this case than meets the eye. Due to the presence of his \\"biker buddy\\" Michael Bowen, series co-star Robert Patrick was noticeably more energized than usual to film the episode, according to Gillian Anderson. In addition, scenes at \\"AAA-1 Surekill Exterminators\\", the business run by Randall and Dwight, were filmed at an actual business front located on Palmetto Street in Los Angeles. Plot In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase runs from an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs to a police station. After a skirmish with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder blocks for walls and a solid steel door. He screams at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from inside the room. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim. Tammi Peyton enters AAA-1 Surekill Exterminators and plays her message machine, which contains the victim's phone call from the previous night. She attempts to get into her right desk drawer, when Dwight walks in, and begins harassing her about a message on the machine. She mentions the murder to Dwight, and he responds by asking her to try to get Randall on the phone. Dwight then confronts Randall in the alley; Dwight tells him that he doesn't mind what he does, as long as he asks first. Later, Scully and Doggett investigate the Chase residence and find a bullet casing on the floor. Doggett notes that it would be difficult to miss a target in a confined space, but Scully notes it would have if the gunman was shooting from outside. Eventually, Scully proposes that the killer can perceive wave lengths of light not visible with an ordinary human eye, allowing him to virtually see through walls. Scully and Doggett arrive at Surekill and inquire as to the company's client, Carlton Chase. Doggett asks if Dwight did time, and he responds that he did. Doggett asks why Chase would have called Surekill just before his death. After the agents leave, Dwight confronts Tammi about the message, and she lies. Meanwhile, Randall watches Tammi through a wall. Tammi returns to Surekill early the next morning and rushes in to get the deposit book showing she has taken from the Surekill account out of her desk, but is caught by Dwight and Randall. Dwight is interrupted by the FBI, who have a search warrant. Doggett opens the box Tammi was trying to dispose of, which contains nothing, much to her surprise. Dwight claims he runs a clean business, but Scully pulls out several folders containing invoices for Chase. Doggett interrogates Dwight, and Scully interrogates Randall. Randall repeats Dwight's words as he reads his lips through a wall. Randall replies that he and Dwight are just exterminators. Later, Tammi returns home and meets up with Randall, and the two go to the bus station. It becomes clear that they intend to run away together, but that Tammi must go get her stash of money. Meanwhile, Doggett finds phone records that show that Tammi and Chase had back and forth phone calls, late at night. Doggett and Scully search Tammi's apartment, and Doggett redials Tammi's phone, getting the bus station. Tammi returns from the bank and gets back in her car. Dwight surprises her from the back seat and puts a gun to her head, and tells her to drive. Dwight comes to the conclusion that Randall killed Chase because he and Tammi were together. Dwight hands Randall a gun and tells him to shoot Tammi. Tammi tries to talk Randall out of it but Randall shoots through the wall next to her and kills Dwight. Randall is eventually arrested, but Tammi successfully manages to run away. Production Robert Patrick was notably energized to work on \\"Surekill\\". \\"Surekill\\" was written by executive story editor Greg Walker, and marked his second script contribution to the series, after season seven's \\"Brand X\\". \\"Surekill\\" was the first and only episode of The X-Files to be directed by Terrence O'Hara.Hurwitz and Knowles, pp. 236‚Äì240 Although the episode was the eighth aired in the season, it was actually the ninth one filmed, as evidenced by its production number: 8ABX09. Scenes at \\"AAA-1 Surekill Exterminators\\", the business ran by Randall and Dwight, were filmed at an actual business front located on Palmetto Street in Los Angeles.Fraga, p. 197 \\"Surekill\\" guest starred Michael Bowen, a \\"biker buddy\\" of series co-star Robert Patrick. Because of this, Patrick was noticeably more energetic on the set of the episode. Co-star Gillian Anderson recounted, \\"Robert was like an Energizer Bunny. He was just wound and wouldn't unwind until the day was done, no matter how long the day went. So that picked up the energy of the series, in a sense.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 189 Reception \\"Surekill\\" first aired on Fox on January 7, 2001. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.0, meaning that it was seen by 8.0% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 8.18 million households, and 13.3 million viewers. The episode ranked as the 36th most-watched episode for the week ending December 3. The episode subsequently aired in the United Kingdom on the BBC Two on April 28, 2002. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"Ever feel like someone's watching you?\\" The episode received largely negative reviews from critics. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode a B‚Äì, called the premise \\"bor-ring \\", and noted that the episode's antagonist \\"don't do a whole hell of a lot\\". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"B‚Äì\\" and called the episode \\"thoroughly mundane\\", especially in comparison to the preceding episode, \\"Via Negativa\\". Handlen felt that \\"because all of this is very familiar, and without any of the characters distinguishing themselves, there isn‚Äôt much reason to watch.\\" Ultimately, he concluded that \\"'Surekill' isn't terrible, but it's far too easy to see right through.\\" Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one star out of five. The two derided the episode for being overly \\"dull\\", noting \\"you watch with open mouth amazement that writer Greg Walker can spin this premise out for forty-five minutes.\\"Shearman and Pearson, p. 235 Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a- half stars out of four.

It premiered on the Fox network on . The episode was written by David Amman and directed by Richard Compton. \\"Invocation\\" is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. The episode received a Nielsen rating of 8.2 and was viewed by 13.9 million viewers. Overall, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)‚Äîfollowing the alien abduction of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)‚Äîwho work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, a little boy mysteriously reappears after having been kidnapped for ten years. However, he has not aged one bit after his disappearance. While the case stirs up painful memories for Doggett, suspicion stirs that the boy is not all he seems. \\"Invocation\\" would introduce both the character of Luke Doggett, the deceased son of John Doggett, as well as a story arc involving his father trying to solve his murder. A majority of the episode was filmed in Pasadena, California. Plot In 1990, Billy Underwood goes missing at a school fair in Dexter, Oklahoma. Ten years later, Billy's mother Lisa Underwood is called to the local elementary school. She learns that Billy has mysteriously re- appeared at the school, but does not seem to have aged in the decade he was missing. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) arrive at the police station to see Billy. Doggett interviews the boy, who seems to be mute. In attempt to get Billy to speak, Doggett keeps his backpack from him. This infuriates Lisa and leads Scully to question Doggett‚Äôs expertise in child abduction cases. Scully suggests that Billy is an alien abductee, but Doggett believes Ronald Purnell, a local delinquent, may have been involved in the boy's disappearance. Doggett questions Purnell, who expresses confusion when the agent suggests that he should meet Billy. As Doggett sits in his car, he pulls out a photo of his deceased son, Luke. When Billy is returned home, his brother and father are uneasy about his presence; Lisa is blind to these problems. While Lisa and her husband argue about Billy, he wanders into his brother‚Äôs room holding a knife. Lisa finds a bloody knife in his brother's bed the next morning, although the boy is unscathed. Billy stands in the room staring at Josh. Forensic analysis shows the blood to be Billy's, although there are no injuries on him. The knife bears a symbol that Billy drew while being interrogated by Doggett, which was also drawn by a psychic investigator ten years earlier. Meanwhile, Cal Jeppy shows up at Purnell's trailer and hassles him. Purnell goes into the woods and digs up a skull. Later, Jeppy blackmails Purnell into silence over something related to Billy. Scully and Doggett bring the psychic, Sharon Pearl, to meet Billy. After touching Billy, Pearl says that she feels powerful forces acting through him, and that she senses emanations from Doggett as well. She then goes into a seizure, the mysterious symbol forming on her forehead. Scully and Doggett later notice Purnell drive up to the Underwood home. Purnell panics when he sees Billy in his car, but after a short pursuit, Purnell is arrested. The agents fail to find Billy in the vehicle. Elsewhere, Josh Underwood is abducted at a gas station while looking at a horse trailer. The symbol appears on the trailer. After interrogation by Doggett, Purnell confesses to snatching Billy in 1990 on behalf of someone else. Doggett recognizes Purnell was also a victim, and with enough prodding, gets a name: Cal Jeppy. The police and the two FBI agents go to Jeppy‚Äôs home and find Josh in a compartment under the floor of his horse trailer. Doggett chases Jeppy into the woods, catches him, and discovers the skull of Billy that Purnell dug up earlier. As the Underwoods stand over the shallow grave of their long dead son, Doggett express incredulity that the case's conclusion was an instance of justice from beyond the grave and laments an inability to explain it; Scully reasons that the body is explanation enough and that the important thing is that Josh Underwood was saved from the same fate. Production Many of the episode's scenes were filmed in Pasadena, California. \\"Invocation\\" was written by producer David Amann, and marked his fifth script contribution to the series. \\"Invocation\\" was the first of two episode of The X-Files to be directed by Richard Compton; he would later go on to direct the eighth season episode \\"Medusa\\".Hurwitz and Knowles, pp. 236‚Äì240 Although the episode was the fifth aired in the season, it was actually the sixth one filmed, as evidenced by its production number. A majority of the episode was filmed in Pasadena, California. Many of the extras from the episode auditioned via General Casting, a casting agency.Fraga, p. 186 In the episode, Doggett is told by a psychic that his very own son was kidnapped and murdered; thus, \\"Invocation\\" would mark the first appearance of Luke Doggett, the son of John. Luke's story would develop into an arc featuring Doggett trying to find out the truth about his son's murder. Robert Patrick noted \\"['Invocation' started] a very important arc, because you start to see the vulnerability of the Doggett character, what drives him. That's where we first realize something's happened to him. There's a tragedy that's involved with him.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 189 The song that Ronald Purnell sang to Billy to keep him quiet and that was featured as a backmasked message on Scully's tape-recorder is a traditional African American lullaby from the American South called \\"All the Pretty Horses\\". Reception \\"Invocation\\" first aired on Fox on December 3, 2000. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.2, meaning that it was seen by 8.2% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 8.27 million households, and 13.9 million viewers. The episode ranked as the 41st most-watched episode for the week ending December 3.

Club awarded the episode a \\"B‚Äì\\", writing that it is \\"an okay entry that‚Äôs kept from being completely forgettable by some memorable shots [‚Ä¶] and some decent Scully/Dogett banter.\\" Handlen held a mixed feeling toward's Doggett's backstory, noting that its introduction \\"does push the character in ways that undermine some of his strongest traits\\". Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five. The two praised Amman's ability to \\"elicit real-world reactions out of fantastical situations\\".Shearman and Pearson, p. 232‚Äì233 However, Shearman and Pearson took issue with the way Doggett's backstory was extrapolated. They noted that Doggett had been portrayed, up to the point in the series, as a \\"solid and reliable\\" character. However, \\"Invocation\\" sees him \\"[break] protocol and [behave] like a bully\\" because of a case reminiscent of that of his deceased son's, a situation that, the authors reason, is too similar to Mulder's own search for the truth about his sister, Samantha. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris bluntly wrote, \\"'Invocation' is a masterpiece, but only if you grade it on a 'Roadrunners' bell-curve.\\" She elaborated, calling it \\"a run-of-the-mill stand-alone, a combination of 'Revelations' and 'The Calusari'\\"  Notes FootnotesBibliography   External links  * * Category:2000 American television episodes Category:Television episodes about ghosts Category:Television episodes set in Oklahoma Category:The X-Files (season 8) episodes Category:Fiction set in 1990 ","title":"Invocation (The X-Files)"},{"id":"21777135","text":"\\"Patience\\" is the third episode of the eighth season of the American science fiction television series The X-Files. It premiered on the Fox network on . The episode was written and directed by series creator Chris Carter. \\"Patience\\" is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. The episode received a Nielsen rating of 8.2 and was viewed by 13.3 million viewers. The episode received mixed to negative reviews from critics. The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)‚Äîfollowing the alien abduction of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)‚Äîwho work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, John Doggett, after having been assigned to the X-Files, joins Scully to investigate a series of gruesome murders that appear to be the work of a bat-like creature. This being their first case together, Scully and Doggett find that their investigative techniques are less than similar. Carter was inspired to write \\"Patience\\" to emulate the \\"back-to-basics stand alones [‚Ä¶] of the earlier seasons\\". The episode was the first The X-Files entry to neither feature actor David Duchovny nor feature his name in the opening credits. Furthermore, the episode was crafted to be the first to test Doggett's skepticism of paranormal activity. Plot In Burley, Idaho, an undertaker and his wife are brutally murdered by some sort of flying creature. Later, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick), who has been assigned to the X-Files, begin talking about the case. Scully explains about the death of the undertaker and his wife and notes that the cause of death is blood loss from human bite marks on their bodies. Scully and Doggett arrive at the crime scene in Idaho and meet Detective Yale Abbott. He says they are less sure that the bites were made by a human and draws their attention to the strange footprint, believing that wild animals fed on the bodies after the fact. Scully points out that there is only one footprint, which looks ominously human, and that if it were left by an animal there would be more footprints leading to the bodies. Scully and Doggett check out the house and find prints leading upstairs and into the attic. Inside, Scully and Doggett find the missing fingers of the undertaker. They look like they have been regurgitated by something and the claw marks in the attic suggest something was hanging from the rafters. Meanwhile, elderly Mrs. McKesson is killed in her attic while looking at a photo album. At the morgue, Scully explains that she studied the bite wounds and discovered that they are similar, but intrinsically different, than human bites; the saliva on the regurgitated fingers has anti-coagulants in it, which only bats have in their saliva. Doggett finds the evidence interesting, due to the newspaper article he brought Scully: in 1956, a series of deaths was reported that ended when a group of hunters killed a man-bat creature and brought it to the county morgue in part of Montana. The coroner said the creature was neither bat nor man. Then the coroner was killed a few days later and soon after a few more people were killed or disappeared. Scully and Doggett join the investigation at McKesson's home. Scully suggests a connection between the burned body of Ariel McKesson who disappeared in 1956 and her mother, the latest victim. Scully believes that the burned body should be exhumed to potentially learn the connection with the other deaths. Later, the gravediggers already have the coffin excavated when Detective Abbott shows up at the town cemetery. They tell him that they did not have to dig because somebody already dug the coffin up and scratched the lid up. While they drive off with the body, Abbott inspects a dead tree. The creature is within and it eviscerates Abbott. The police are upset about Abbott's death and blame Scully while Doggett reminds them that only the thing that killed Abbott and the others is to blame. Scully explains Ariel McKesson died of heart failure and then was burned to cover something up. She realizes that all the victims were people who came in contact with the body of Ariel McKesson: Abbott investigated the crime, her mother identified the body, the undertaker prepared the body, and Myron Stefaniuk pulled the body from the river. All but Myron Stefaniuk are now dead. Doggett and Scully find Myron and ask him about Ernie Stefaniuk, one of the hunters from 1956, who he reveals disappeared a long time ago. The two eventually track down Ernie Stefaniuk, who tells them that he hid on an island in the middle of the town's lake with his wife, Ariel, for 44 years. Ernie says that the bat creature kills anyone with Ernie's scent on them, so he had burned his wife's body to try and cover up the scent. He informs them that it hunts only at night and Myron is in danger. Doggett goes back to find Myron only to be attacked and badly torn up by the creature at the river. Ernie says Scully is now marked and the creature will go after her too. When his ground radar goes off, Scully goes outside. Ernie stays inside and is butchered by the bat creature. Scully returns to see it ravaging Ernie; she manages to shoot it before being knocked down. Doggett appears and shoots the creature several more times, saving Scully. The creature disappears into the night while Scully helps the injured Doggett. Back at the office, they get a fax from Myron, who survived and has gone into hiding in Wyoming. Production Live right \\"Patience\\" was written and directed by series creator Chris Carter. The episode, inspired by the \\"back- to-basics stand alones [‚Ä¶] of the earlier seasons\\", features a human-bat hybrid as the main villain; this character was inspired by the 1970s comic book villain, Man-Bat, one of the arch-nemeses of Batman. During the filming of the episode, live bats, such as the Egyptian fruit bat were used. \\"Patience\\" was the first to test Doggett's skepticism of paranormal activity. As Robert Patrick explained, \\"['Patience'] is where it starts to toy with my willingness to believe in the paranormal and strange happenings. You've got a guy that's a bat, which is sort of out of the norm.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 186 The episode was also the first episode of The X-Files to neither feature actor David Duchovny nor feature his name in the opening credits. After settling his contract dispute with Fox, Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the seventh season. (In order to explain Mulder's absence, Duchovny's character was abducted by aliens in the seventh season finale, \\"Requiem\\".) ReceptionRatings= \\"Patience\\" first aired on Fox on November 19, 2000. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.2, meaning that it was seen by 8.2% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 8.27 million households, and 13.3 million viewers. The episode ranked as the 42nd most-watched episode for the week ending November 19. The episode subsequently aired in the United Kingdom on the BBC Two on July 28, 2002. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"More deadly than a man. More ruthless than a bat. A hungry predator waits in the darkness for its next prey... Scully and Doggett.\\" =Reviews= Jay Anderson, writing for What Culture, was positive toward the episode. While noting the show's return to its \\"dark, creepy [...] roots\\" in the eighth season, Anderson described the episode as an \\"early success at returning to the realm of the scary\\". Anderson ranked the human bat as the eighth creepiest creature of the show. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode a D and criticized the episode's references to Mulder's absence, most notably the scene wherein Scully put Mulder's nameplate away, asking, sardonically, \\"Is that supposed to be symbolic, I wonder?\\" Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that, despite the fact that \\"a lot of [the episode] works [‚Ä¶] because the scenes between Doggett and Scully are so good\\", the positive aspects of the episode were not \\"put to better use in a more exciting episode; this particular case hardly stretched anyone's deductive prowess.\\" Shearman and Pearson later wrote that if the episode had been \\"a Mulder and Scully adventure, this would have been bottom of the barrel stuff.\\"Shearman and Pearson, p. 231 Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"C+\\" and criticized both its monster and its guest cast. Concerning the former, she wrote that it was \\"just ridiculous\\" and that its design was \\"bland and generic\\". Concerning the latter, she wrote that the cast was filled with \\"actors hamming it up\\". VanDerWerff did note that the episode was better \\"than its reputation\\" suggested, but that it still was \\"undone by some very strange story choices and a dumb monster\\". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris bluntly wrote, \\"if you're looking for a suspenseful, bite-your-nails, monster-of-the-week X-Files episode‚Ä¶ this isn't it.\\" Furthermore, she criticized the villain, calling it \\"a dull monster in fake-looking make-up\\". =Awards= \\"Patience\\" earned a nomination for an ASC Award by the American Society of Cinematographers for Outstanding Achievement in Cinematography - Regular Series.

Davis, 424 U.S. 693 (1976), is a United States Supreme Court case in which a sharply divided Court held that the plaintiff, whom the local police chief had named an \\"active shoplifter,\\" suffered no deprivation of liberty resulting from injury to his reputation.. In the case, the court broke from precedents and restricted the definition of the constitutional right to privacy \\"to matters relating to 'marriage procreation, contraception, family relationships, and child rearing and education\\". Background The plaintiff, Edward C. Davis III, had been previously arrested on shoplifting charges. After the charges were dropped, Davis sued the Louisville, KY chief of police for distributing \\"active shoplifter\\" posters to merchants throughout the city. Majority Holding In a 5-3 decision in favor of the police chief, Paul, Justice Rehnquist wrote the opinion for the majority. The majority opinion held that petitioner's alleged defamation, a typical state court claim, was not actionable under the Due Process Clause and 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983. The procedural guarantees of the Due Process Clause could not be the source for a body of general federal court law. The Court also found that respondent's injury to reputation was not specially protected by ¬ß 1983 and the Due Process Clause. Damage to reputation, alone, apart from some more tangible interests, was not sufficient to invoke the protection of the Due Process Clause. Further, the police chief did not deprive respondent of any state-provided right, and respondent's case was not within the constitutional zone of privacy. The Court reversed the judgment. Dissenting Opinion Justice Brennan wrote the dissenting opinion which was joined by Justice Marshall and which Justice White concurred in part. Justice Brennan pointed out that the majority's opinion was inconsistent with the Court's prior case law and was unduly restrictive in its construction of the Bill of Rights. Justice Brennan pointed out that the majority misread the precedence in Adickes v. S. H. Kress & Co.. which they believed supported the idea that the existence of a state remedy (such as a cause of action for defamation) would be relevant to the determination whether there is a separate cause of action under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983 citing Monroe v. Pape. and McNeese v. Board of Educ.. which clarified that the federal remedy is supplementary to the state remedy and that the state remedy need not be first sought and refused before the federal one could be invoked. Justice Brennan further points out that the majority \\"by mere fiat and with no analysis, wholly excludes personal interest in reputation from the ambit of \\"life, liberty, or property\\" under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, thus rendering due process concerns never applicable to the official stigmatization, however arbitrary, of an individual\\" adding that \\"The logical and disturbing corollary of this holding is that no due process infirmities would inhere in a statute constituting a commission to conduct ex party trials of individuals, so long as the only official judgment pronounced was limited to the public condemnation and branding of a person as a Communist, a traitor, an \\"active murderer,\\" a homosexual, or any other mark that \\"merely\\" carries social opprobrium\\" further pointing out that \\"The potential of [the majority's holding] is frightening for a free people.\\" and that it finds no support in relevant constitutional jurisprudence. The Court previously held in Meyer v. Nebraska that \\"Without doubt, [liberty] denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint, but also the right of the individual . . . generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized . . . as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.\\". In a concurring opinion in Rosenblatt v. Baer, Justice Stewart pointed out that the individual's right to the protection of his own good name...reflects no more than our basic concept of the essential dignity and worth of every human being‚Äîa concept at the root of any decent system of ordered liberty. The protection of private personality, like the protection of life itself, is left primarily to the individual States under the Ninth and Tenth Amendments. But this does not mean that the right is entitled to any less recognition by this Court as a basic of our constitutional system.\\". See also . Justice Brennan also points out that the majority essentially ignored the case of Jenkins v. McKeithen,. a case closely akin to the factual pattern of the current case which was also about an action brought under ¬ß 1983, and recognized that the public branding of an individual implicates interests cognizable as either \\"liberty\\" or \\"property\\" and held that such public condemnation cannot be accomplished without procedural safeguards designed to eliminate arbitrary or capricious executive action. Justice Brennan went on to say > I have always thought that one of this Court's most important roles is to > provide a formidable bulwark against governmental violation of the > constitutional safeguards securing in our free society the legitimate > expectations of every person to innate human dignity and sense of worth. It > is a regrettable abdication of that role and a saddening denigration of our > majestic Bill of Rights when the Court tolerates arbitrary and capricious > official conduct branding an individual as a criminal without compliance > with constitutional procedures designed to ensure the fair and impartial > ascertainment of criminal culpability.

The show centers on FBI special agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson)‚Äîas well as ex-FBI agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)‚Äîwho work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Mulder, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), and Doggett come up against the horrible consequences of the Syndicate's pact with the aliens, as Billy Miles (Zachary Ansley)‚Äînow reprogrammed as a Supersoldier‚Äîattempts to erase all evidence of the tests‚Äîincluding Scully's soon-to-be-born baby. Upon hearing information from Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), the men reluctantly call upon him as well as Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) to help them. \\"Essence\\" is a story milestone for the series. It was one of the later season eight episodes, starting with \\"Per Manum\\", that introduced the story arc about super-soldiers, which would continue throughout the ninth season. The series was the first part of two, and concluded with the season finale \\"Existence\\". In addition, Nicholas Lea reprises his role as Alex Krycek, who temporarily switches sides and aids Mulder and Scully. Plot While preparing for Dana Scully's (Gillian Anderson) baby shower, her mother Margaret (Sheila Larken) invites a woman named Lizzy Gill to help Scully around her apartment. Unbeknownst to Scully, Gill tampers with her pregnancy medication. Meanwhile, Billy Miles (Zachary Aynsley), satisfied with the research conducted at Zeus Genetics, kills the head scientist, Dr. Lev, and burns the laboratory. All of the evidence at Zeus Genetics is destroyed, including the viable hybrid fetus. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) informs John Doggett (Robert Patrick) of the fire, and asks to go along to survey the crime scene. Mulder reveals that Lev is connected to Scully's former obstetrician, Dr. Parenti. While searching Parenti's office, the agents find another storage room containing hybrid fetuses. They confront Parenti, who denies everything. Back at Scully's apartment, Gill leaves for the day. She gets into a car driven by Duffy Haskell, and tells him she thinks Scully trusts her. At the lab, Agent Crane derides Doggett for dealing with Mulder. Mulder and Doggett head back to Parenti's office, during which time Miles appears and decapitates Parenti. As they enter Parenti's office, they confront Miles‚ÄîMulder is thrown through a glass barrier while Doggett shoots him several times with no apparent effect. While Mulder and Doggett are distracted, Miles escapes. The two go to Scully's house to regroup. Gill overhears and contacts Haskell, who is at an illegal human cloning facility. At the other end, Haskell is also decapitated by Miles. As Doggett, Mulder, and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) survey Haskell's murder scene, Scully catches Gill in the act of tampering with her medication. Later, Gill confesses that she, along with Haskell and others, have been monitoring Scully's pregnancy as part of the alien colonists' plans. However, she tells the agents that Scully's baby is a perfect human child with no human weaknesses. Mulder, fearing for Scully's safety, prepares to take her away. Doggett and Crane receive a call from Miles claiming to surrender, but this turns out to be a distraction. Miles instead goes after Scully, just as she and Mulder escape. As Miles is about to catch Mulder and Scully, Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) runs him over and takes them to Doggett and Skinner, just before Miles gets back up. Krycek states that Miles is one of a new type of aliens that are trying to wipe out humanity's ability to survive the invasion‚Äîincluding Scully's baby, which Krycek states is a special child that the aliens fear. Mulder tells Doggett to send for help. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) arrives as Miles shows up at the J. Edgar Hoover Building. Scully is able to sneak out of the building with the help of Krycek, Doggett and Reyes. Mulder and Skinner, meanwhile, lead Miles to the roof, where Mulder pushes him off into a waiting garbage truck, which then compacts him. Scully and Reyes pull away. The episode ends with Crane pointing them to safety, then turning around, revealing to the camera that he is a Super Soldier. Production \\"Essence\\" was written by series creator Chris Carter. The episode, which was the first part of two and concluded with the season finale \\"Existence\\", was written during a time of uncertainty for the series. Near the end of season eight, it was unclear whether or not the show would continue onto a ninth season. Carter had maintained for sometime that he would not continue the show without lead actor David Duchovny. However, Duchovny announced that after the end of the eighth season, he would leave the show for good. In addition, lead actress Gillian Anderson's contract also expired at the end of the eighth season. Anderson had expressed her growing disinterest in the series ever since the beginning of the eighth season, saying \\"For a lot of people, if you don't like your job, you can quit your job, I don't necessarily have that option.\\" Anderson cited the fact that \\"eight years is a long time\\" as a contributing factor to her indifference. However, Carter soon changed his position and announced he would remain on the show and continue only if Anderson agreed to do another season. Eventually, Fox offered Anderson a \\"generous\\" incentive to stay, resulting in the retention of Carter and Anderson and a final season of the show. The episode marks the return of Nicholas Lea as Alex Krycek. In previous episodes, Krycek was one of the series' main antagonists. However, in \\"Essence\\", he temporarily switches sides. As such, portraying actor Lea explains the character's motivation: \\"Toward the end, he realizes that it's possible that the world could completely go down the tubes‚Äîthen he's got a stake in trying to keep that from happening. That's when he starts giving the information to Mulder so that he can use it.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 197. ReceptionRatings= \\"Essence\\" first aired on Fox on . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7.7, meaning that it was seen by 7.7% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 7.87 million households, and 12.8 million viewers. The episode ranked as the 41st most-watched episode for the week ending April 8. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the episode made its first televised appearance on June 28, 2001, on Sky1 and was the third most watched program that week, receiving 0.65 million viewers. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e June 25-July 1, 2001\\", listed under Sky 1 Fox promoted the episode with a poster parodying the 1968 horror movie Rosemary's Baby. The episode's tagline was \\"Scully's baby is born.\\" The episode was later included on The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 ‚Äì Super Soldiers, a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien super soldiers arc. =Reviews= \\"Essence\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B+\\", noting that while much of the episode was a \\"blur\\", it was nonetheless exciting. Handlen was complimentary towards the installment's \\"tremendous sense of purpose [that] builds to a fever pitch that makes questions of who exactly wants what largely irrelevant.\\" While he offered a pessimistic opinion in regards to the series' mythology as a whole, Handlen concluded that the eighth season's sense of purpose, as exemplified in \\"Essence\\", made the episode successful. George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of Contra Costa Times praised the episode, writing \\"where have nifty episodes like [\\"Essence\\"] been the last two years?\\" Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. Praising the storyline, he noted that \\"Thanks to 'Essence', I've become a believer again.\\"Kessenich, pp. 179‚Äì83. Gareth Wigmore of TV Zone was positive toward both \\"Essence\\" and \\"Existence\\". Wigmore gave the episodes a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote \\"the reason that this two-parter works is that its plot is simple enough for the audience to still have a handle on\\". Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity awarded the episode a B+. Not all reviews were so positive, however. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a more mixed two stars out of five.Shearman and Pearson, p. 247. The two cited dense dialogue and bizarre characterization‚Äîmost notably the fact that \\"there's usually one FBI agent so angry that he interrupts [...] only to be stopped by a calmer counterpart\\"‚Äîas detractors. Shearman and Pearson, however, did praise the final ten minutes, noting that the final act was \\"so good [...] that it almost makes up for the episode which sadly returns to the style of the traditional mytharc exposition\\". Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it no stars out of four. She heavily derided the plot, noting that the episode turned Scully into a \\"passive, mostly silent Virgin Mary who is about to give birth to‚Ä¶ Jesus Christ.\\" She concluded that the episode \\"raise[ed] the [misogyny] to a whole new level\\".

The episode first aired in the United States on May 6, 2001 on Fox, and subsequently aired in the United Kingdom on Sky1 on June 14, 2001. It was written and directed by executive producer Frank Spotnitz. \\"Alone\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 7.5 and was viewed by 12.7 million viewers. It received mixed to positive reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson)‚Äîas well as ex-FBI agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)‚Äîwho work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Doggett is paired with an enthusiastic young agent named Leyla Harrison who knows everything about the X-Files, when Scully goes on maternity leave. Harrison's apotheosis of Mulder and Scully leads to Doggett learning a thing or two. But when Harrison and Doggett disappear, Mulder defies orders in an attempt to find them. \\"Alone\\" marked the directorial debut of Spotnitz, who had been a writer on the show for several years. In addition, the episode would be the last Monster-of-the-Week episode to feature an appearance by David Duchovny as Fox Mulder until the Season 10 revival. The character of Leyla Harrison was named after an X-Files fan who died of cancer in 2001.  Plot  In Ellicott, New York, Arlen Sacks is killed by an unknown creature that sprays venom on its victims, and his son Gary goes missing. In the meantime, at the FBI headquarters, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), preparing for maternity leave, packs up her belongings at the X-Files office. Scully finds a medallion commemorating the Apollo 11 space flight that was given to her for her birthday by Fox Mulder (David Duchovny). Scully gives John Doggett (Robert Patrick) the medallion, explaining that it symbolizes teamwork. After Scully leaves, Special Agent Leyla Harrison arrives and tells Doggett that she is his new partner. The two are soon assigned to investigate Sacks's bizarre murder. At the crime scene, Doggett and Harrison search for clues. Doggett finds evidence of the venom, which is sent to an FBI lab for analysis. Harrison explains to Doggett that in her previous job she processed Mulder and Scully's travel expenses during their time on the X-Files, and has thus gained an encyclopedic knowledge of their investigations. Following a wooded trail from the crime scene, Doggett and Harrison stumble upon an upscale mansion and make their way inside. A strange creature clinging to the wall secretly observes their every move. Doggett discovers a study full of biology journals and a copy of the anthropologist Richard Leakey's book The Sixth Extinction. Doggett pulls out his gun, sensing that something is amiss, and finds Harrison in the hallway. He then instructs Harrison to position herself outside while he tries to flush the creature out of the house. Moments after Doggett instructs Harrison to stand guard he hears gun shots being fired. Rushing outside, he cannot find Harrison anywhere in the yard. He walks farther to the edge and falls through a trap door at the edge of the front lawn. During an autopsy, Scully correctly deduces that Arlen was blinded by reptile venom. Meanwhile, Doggett and Harrison, having fallen into old bootlegger tunnels below the mansion grounds, encounter the creature and are sprayed with venom, temporarily blinding them. The two find Gary Sacks in dire need of medical attention nearby. Noting Doggett and Harrison's absence, Mulder searches the area around the mansion for clues and encounters the owner, Herman Stites, who identifies himself as a biologist. Mulder soon leaves the area as Stites notices Doggett about to escape the tunnels and knocks him back in. Mulder waits in his car in Stites' driveway until dark, telling Scully that he found the Apollo medallion near Stites' estate and is convinced Doggett is somewhere nearby. He spots the creature and chases it to the mansion where it climbs up to a second floor. Mulder follows the creature into the house and down into the tunnels, where he encounters Harrison and Doggett. With the creature approaching, Mulder tells the still-blinded Doggett to open fire at him on his command. The blinded Doggett then shoots the creature as it leaps at Mulder; the deceased creature then turns into Stites. Later, Scully and Mulder meet Doggett, who has now fully recovered, at the hospital. He tells them that Harrison will make a full recovery as well but that she is transferring herself off of the X-Files. Mulder attempts to give Doggett the Apollo medallion, but Doggett insists that it be given to Harrison instead. Mulder and Scully then present it to Harrison together, who accepts it in awe.  Production  right =Writing and directing= The episode was written by executive producer Frank Spotnitz, and marked his directorial debut. Because of his position as both the writer of the episode and the director, Spotnitz later noted that it was hard to achieve perfection when filming the episode. However, he did note that, as both the writer and director, he had more creative control than usual. Originally Spotnitz did not have plans to direct the episode, but he was encouraged to do so by David Duchovny; Duchovny reminded Spotnitz that it would be the last Monster-of-the- Week (stand-alone) episode to feature his character, Fox Mulder. After production and shooting was finalized, the rough cut of \\"Alone\\" was nine minutes over time and in order to compensate for the time, various sections were cut during final editing. Robert Patrick was very pleased with Spotnitz's work, stating, \\"You're talking about some incredibly intelligent individuals, and they were very willing to let you, as an artist, discover what they were trying to do with the role. That's a wonderful environment to work in.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 197. For the episode, Gillian Anderson's character Dana Scully was written off as a member of the X-Files office, since the next season would focus on the \\"new\\" X-Files headed by Doggett and Reyes. Because of this change, Spotnitz called \\"Alone\\" the last of the \\"old\\" X-Files stand-alone episodes. As with many other episodes, Duchovny did not want his character to have all the answers, giving the reason that it looked too easy for him. Duchovny and Spotnitz later had a long discussion on how to remove the scenes or tweak them. Unfortunately, because the episode was the last stand-alone episode to feature the character of Fox Mulder, Duchovny did not care as much as \\"usual\\" about creating a \\"mystery\\" for the episode. =Casting= Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) appeared in the episode only because Spotnitz wanted a chance to direct an episode that featured his character. However, because the episode was over time, Spotnitz ended up editing a large majority of his more \\"prominent\\" scenes out. In addition, another section that was scripted but ultimately cut was a scene between Anderson and Duchovny. Jolie Jenkins' character, Leyla Harrison, was created and named in memory of a The X-Files internet fan and prolific writer of fan fiction of the same name, who died of cancer on February 10, 2001. Jenkins' characterization, according to Spotnitz, \\"br[ought] out the Clint [Eastwood] in Robert Patrick\\", and her performance was called \\"near perfection\\" by Spotnitz during the audio commentary for this episode. Due to Harrison's extensive knowledge of the X-Files, the episode contains several references to previous episodes.Shearman and Pearson, p. 246.Shearman and Pearson, p. 272. While looking through her desk drawer, Scully finds the merged coin from the sixth-season entry \\"Dreamland\\"; the Apollo 11 space flight medallion, which was given to her by Mulder in the fourth-season episode \\"Tempus Fugit\\"; and her dog Queequeg's name tag, which she was given in the third-season episode \\"Clyde Bruckman's Final Repose\\". While investigating, Harrison mentions a liver-eating mutant that produced bile and died under an escalator, a reference to Eugene Victor Tooms, who appeared in the first-season episodes \\"Squeeze\\" and \\"Tooms\\"; aliens that shed their skin and leave behind a residue similar to mucus, a reference to the alien from \\"The Beginning\\"; and subterranean men in Florida who took people underground, as featured in \\"Detour\\". While searching through Stites' house, Doggett finds a book entitled The Sixth Extinction, a potential reference to the seventh-season episode of the same name. In the episode's final scene, Harrison asks Mulder how he and Scully managed to return to America after escaping from a spaceship in Antarctica, a reference to an event that took place at the end of the 1998 X-Files feature film.  Reception  \\"Alone\\" debuted on Fox on May 6, 2001 in the United States. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7.5, meaning that it was seen by 7.5% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 7.56 million households, and 12.7 million viewers. The episode ranked as the 35th-most watched episode for the week ending May 6. On June 14, 2001, the episode premiered in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 and received 480,000 viewers making it the sixth-most watched episode that week, behind Star Trek: Voyager and The Simpsons. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e June 18‚Äì24, 2001\\", listed under Sky 1 Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"Don't watch alone.\\" The episode was met with mixed to positive reviews. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A‚Äì\\", applauded Duchovny's apparent energy to be acting on the series once again. However, he felt that the \\"overtness\\" of the episode resulted in many scenes coming off as too on- the-nose or strained. Television Without Pity gave the episode a B‚Äì rating but slightly criticized the way Fox was using Duchovny, sardonically writing, \\"I don't know if you're aware of this, but David Duchovny stars in The X-Files. Did you know that? Because they've really been keeping it under wraps at Fox.\\" Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three- and-a-half stars out of five and called it \\"an exercise in nostalgia\\". The two called the episode \\"touching\\" and noted that many of the in-jokes in the script, such as Harrison asking the agents how they got back from Antarctica, were \\"very funny\\". Shearman and Pearson, however, did slightly critique the way the X-Files were presented noting that the case was comparatively a \\"rather low-key humdrum affair\\". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a positive review, writing, \\"The future of The X-Files is unsettled, but 'Alone' served as a pleasant reminder of what has come before and why the journey to this point has, for the most part, been so wonderful.\\"Kessenich, p. 179. Not all reviews were positive. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four. She derided the plot, writing \\"Why? Who knows? Who cares?\\" Vitaris further criticized the episode incorporation of the fandom and suggested that some of the questions asked by Harrison were meant to be \\"making fun\\" of \\"fannish questions\\".

The episode first aired in the United States and Canada on April 29, 2001, on the Fox Network, and in the United Kingdom on June 7. It was written by staff member Steven Maeda, was directed by Rod Hardy, and forms part of the series' overarching mythology. The episode received a Nielsen household rating of 7.4 and was viewed by 11.8 million viewers. \\"Vienen\\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics, many of whom appreciated its hearkening-back to the older mythology of The X-Files. The season centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick), and Scully's former partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), who work on X-Filescases linked to the paranormal. In this episode, Mulder disobeys orders to stay away from the X-Files and finds himself stranded on a quarantined oil platform with Doggett. They soon discover that the crew has been infected with the black oil, an alien virus that Mulder and Scully have encountered many times before. Despite their dislike for each other, Mulder and Doggett team up and escape before the infected crew members are able to capture and kill them. The episode was a series milestone, and features the last appearance of the alien black oil before the series finale, where it appeared via flashback‚Äîa plot device that plays a significant role in the series and in the 1998 X-Files movie. The oil effects were created using chocolate syrup and molasses. Principal filming for \\"Vienen\\" was carried out at three locations: an oil platform, an oil refinery, and on a specially-created set. The episode's title is a Spanish word meaning \\"they come\\" or \\"they are coming\\", and has been interpreted as foreshadowing the show's Super Soldier narrative arc. Elements of the plot have been compared to the ancient Greek religious and mythological figure Orpheus. Plot Simon de la Cruz, a worker on an oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico, fatally stabs fellow crew member Ed Dell, the radio operator. He then starts destroying the platform's radio equipment but is confronted by Bo Taylor, whose body then begins to glow. At FBI headquarters, Special Agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) tells Special Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) about the murder and explains that ninety percent of de la Cruz's body was covered with apparent radiation burns. Galpex Petroleum, the platform's owner, officially attributes the burns to an explosion but Mulder suspects the involvement of black oil. Mulder and Doggett meet Galpex's vice-president Martin Ortega (Miguel Sandoval), who tells them that the company has discovered a large oil reserve in the Gulf of Mexico. Deputy Director Alvin Kersh (James Pickens, Jr.) sends Doggett to the Gulf to investigate, but Mulder is already present when Doggett arrives. The agents meet Taylor, who claims de la Cruz tried to blow up the platform. Meanwhile, Special Agent Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) finds black oil in de la Cruz's skull during an autopsy‚Äîthe oil is dead and seems to have been irradiated. She concludes that he may have had some immunity to the black oil because he is a Huecha Indian, or an indigenous Mexican national. Doggett and Mulder find proof of black oil on the platform and quarantine it, but de la Cruz's friend Diego Garza is missing. Ortega threatens to bring back the crew unless the agents can provide proof of an infection. Doggett and Mulder search for Garza who, like de la Cruz, also has Native American heritage. Mulder and Doggett later discover that somebody has set fire to the communications room. As the agents tackle the fire, Garza attacks Doggett and renders him unconscious. When he awakens, Garza, now mentally unstable, cuts his arm to check for the presence of black oil. Meanwhile, an annoyed Kersh tells Scully that he is lifting the quarantine of the oil platform. Scully opposes the idea but she has no choice other than to obey. Scully then realizes that de la Cruz is immune to the black oil, and because of it, he suffered from radiation burns instead of infection. After talking to Garza, Doggett leaves to find Mulder but is attacked by Taylor. Mulder arrives and overpowers Taylor, and Mulder and Doggett barricade themselves in the communication room, and try to relay a message while the platform's crew attack the door. Scully receives Doggett and Mulder's message, and tells them that Kersh has broken the quarantine. Mulder destroys the platform's radio so that the black oil-infected crew cannot communicate with the aliens. Suddenly, the platform workers stop their attack and begin to sabotage the rig. Doggett and Mulder leave the radio room, and jump off the rig when they realize that the crew are going to destroy it. They are rescued by the helicopters Kersh has sent to break the quarantine. Later, at the FBI, Mulder tells Doggett that he has been dismissed from the bureau. ProductionWriting and filming= alt=An oil platform in the Atlantic Ocean. \\"Vienen\\" was written by Steven Maeda as a vehicle for Mulder to pass on the X-Files legacy to Doggett. Patrick compared Mulder to a Greek chorus and said that the episode was a \\"way to have Mulder give Doggett his blessing and pass him The X-Files baton.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles (2008), p. 192. Maeda complimented the show's producers for deciding to pass the X-Files division over to Doggett, noting that they were \\"aware of what's going on in the audience's head\\". The title, \\"Vienen,\\" is Spanish; it is the third-person plural present indicative form of venir, which means \\"they come\\" or \\"they are coming\\". The episode was directed by Rod Hardy, who directed the earlier season eight episodes \\"Roadrunners\\" and \\"Salvage\\".Hardy, 4:304:35. Hardy was offered the role after an unknown individual working on The X-Files saw his TBS remake of the film High Noon.Hardy, 9:409:55. Of the three season eight episodes that he helmed, Hardy enjoyed directing this episode most due to its adherence to the series' mythology; he later described the episode as \\"classic X-Files.\\"Hardy, 1:221:30.Hardy, 4:07. The eighth season was filmed out of order; \\"Vienen\\" was the sixteenth episode produced but the eighteenth aired, largely due to Duchovny's availability.Hardy, 4:255:40. Each episode of The X-Files usually took about eighteen days to film, including seven days for pre-production, nine for main-unit shooting, and two for second-unit filming. \\"Vienen\\" was produced in eleven days because the crew worked thirteen- to fourteen-hour shifts.Hardy, 21:5822:58. \\"Vienen\\" was shot in three locations: a studio in Los Angeles, a closed-down CENCO oil refinery in Santa Fe Springs, and an offshore oil platform in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Santa Barbara.Hardy, 0:331:11. During the show's previous seasons, location manager Ilt Jones had been required to scout for locations after scripts were submitted. Starting with the eighth season, however, he was allowed to go on several \\"scouting roadshow[s]\\" in order to find new and interesting locations that could be written into scripts. Jones, who discovered the oil platform and the refinery during his first scouting trip, later said the oil platform was \\"his favorite example\\" of places he was able to find. Because the platform and refinery were scouted in advance, Jones was given six weeks to prepare the shoota \\"far cry\\" from the usual two. This added time also saved the series a considerable amount of money. Filming on the oil platform occurred between sunrise and sunset in one day.Hardy, 10:4910:59. The film crew used Steadicams for filming on the oil platform because the decks were slick with oil and, according to Hardy, the cameras \\"sort of fit and blend[ed] in quite well\\" on the platform.Hardy, 14:5715:16. The series' leading actors were required to film in three separate locations. Anderson's scenes were filmed solely on the show's sets in Los Angeles.Hardy, 12:5013:05. Since her character did not accompany Mulder and Doggett, Anderson had no scenes with Patrick and Duchovny, except for the opening sequence that takes place in Kersh's office.Hardy, 8:358:43. Most of Patrick and Duchovny's scenes were filmed on the oil platform and at the refinery, although several key scenes, including the destruction of the oil platform, were filmed on the show's set in Los Angeles. Patrick and Duchovny were flown between the three locations. Others scenes were filmed in the studio. Production designer Corey Kaplan was tasked with recreating the oil platform's control room, mess hall, and some operational sections, which required \\"a brilliant piece of synergy between all [of the series'] departments\\" in order to come together. The scene in which the oil platform bursts into flame was created in the studio on the mock-rig set. The set was made of wood, posing a unique challenge for the art department, as they had to make it look as if the fire was melting steel.Hardy, 29:5230:15. =Special effects= alt=Ice cream balls covered in chocolate syrup. The scene in which Mulder and Doggett agree to jump from the oil platformwhich was shot in a way that evokes a similar scene in the 1969 film Butch Cassidy and the Sundance KidHardy, 41:41.was filmed by having Patrick and Duchovny jump in front of a green screen.Hardy, 41:1841:26. Separate footage of the rig exploding, created by combining actual shots of the rig with CGI, was then filmed, and the two shots were composited on top of one another.Hardy, 41:4541:59. The episode featured the penultimate appearance of the alien black oil; it would appear for a final time via flashback in the series finale. Visual effects for the black oil were created by combining molasses and chocolate syrup with computer-generated imagery (CGI) imagery.Hardy, 18:3918:45. Nine takes were needed for the scene in which the black oil pours out of a worker's eyes, ears, and mouth, as the syrupy mixture would not spill correctly.Hardy, 19:0019:06. Themes Michelle Bush, in her book Myth-X, noted that the oil platform is named \\"Galpex-Orpheux\\", a reference to the ancient Greek religious and mythological figure Orpheus, who was a legendary musician, poet, and prophet. According to the myth, Orpheus's wife Eurydice stepped on a viper, was bitten, and died instantly. Hades, the god of the underworld‚Äîafter hearing Orpheus' moving music‚Äîallowed Orpheus to retrieve his wife's soul with one condition: he must not look at her until the two of them have climbed safely out of the underworld. Orpheus fails, and his wife's soul is returned to the underworld. Bush compared Orpheus's otherworldly singing to the \\"broadband signal which is the catalyst for the events on the rig\\". In the episode, Mulder, Doggett, and the two Huecha Indians \\"wreak havoc\\" because of their fear, and the \\"black oil slips back to the underworld\\".Bush (2008), p. 155. In regards to the episode's title, Bush argued that while the Spanish word vienen means \\"they are coming\\", the episode does not explain who \\"they\\" are. She wrote that the verb could refer to either \\"the aliens\\" who are planning on colonizing the Earth or to \\"the humans that are disturbing the black oil\\". Douglas Kellner, in his book Media Spectacle, writes that, because the episode alludes to the series' \\"Super Soldiers\\" story arc (a plot thread that had previously been referenced in the eighth-season episode \\"This Is Not Happening\\" and which would be explored heavily near the end of the show's eighth season and throughout its ninth), it is likely that the title refers to the inevitable onslaught of these alien warriors.Kellner (2003), p. 154. ReceptionRatings and release= \\"Vienen\\" premiered on American television on April 29, 2001. It received a Nielsen household rating of 7.4, meaning that it was seen by an estimated 7.4% of US households and was viewed by 11.8 million viewers overall. The episode debuted in Ireland and the United Kingdom on June 7 on Sky 1, and was the channel's sixth-most watched program for that week with 0.52 million viewers. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e June 410, 2001\\", listed under Sky 1 On November 4, 2003, the episode was released as part of the eighth-season DVD box set. Vienen was later included on The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 ‚Äì Super Soldiers, a DVD collection including episodes involving the alien super soldiers arc. The episode's casting and plot initially proved controversial when in early 2001, Hispanic activists complained about the often negative portrayal of Latinos on television, particularly in the Law & Order episode \\"Sunday in the Park with Jorge\\". In turn, the major broadcasters signed agreements that created a head of diversity at each network. When the episode's title and synopsis were announced, some activists worried that it would further propagate negative stereotypes. =Reviews= Michael Liedtke and George Avalos of the Contra Costa Times were pleased with the episode and wrote, \\"The latest episode also contained many of the elements of a classic mythology episode. The stakes were huge and the heroes faced the greatest of hazards. The use of the oil rig created a sense of isolation for Mulder and Doggett, and the paranoia levels were sky-high. We still can't figure out why we haven't seen more episodes along the lines of Vienen during the past three seasons.\\" Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity awarded the episode a \\"B\\". Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave Vienen a positive review, and wrote, \\"after watching 'Vienen', I can honestly say that for once of the few times this season, it felt good to be an X-Files fan again\\". Kessenich praised the significant development in Mulder and Scully's relationship and the return of the \\"fourth season version\\" of the black oil; the 1998 movie had dramatically altered the nature of the substanceinfected hosts gestate aliens inside their bodies rather than merely being taken over.Kessenich (2003), p. 173. Emily VanDerWerff from The A.V. Club named the episode one of the \\"10 must-see episodes\\" of The X-Files, and wrote that it \\"abruptly makes the series‚Äô alien- conspiracy storyline relevant again.\\" Her review concludes, \\"[i]t's a fine example of a show past its glory days, nevertheless finding a way to make itself relevant again.\\" VanDerWerff later awarded the episode an \\"A‚àí\\" and praised‚Äîin addition to its refreshing take on the alien mythology‚Äîthe episode's location, noting that the oil rig's \\"isolation and man-made island status, was definitely the sort of place that would look and feel different from just about every other episode of the show.\\" She also applauded the dynamic between Mulder and Doggett, and wrote that the episode successfully was a way for \\"David Duchovny and Fox Mulder to pass the torch to Robert Patrick and John Doggett.\\" Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five and wrote that the installment's return to the black oil mythos seemed \\"out of date\\". They also wrote that Mulder and Doggett are \\"good at running away, which doesn't give either of them much dignity.\\"Shearman and Pearson (2009), p. 245. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She wrote, \\"as action- adventure, 'Veinen' is so-so. Except for the big 'money shot' explosion at the end, it doesn't exploit the possibilities of the physical location.\\" Meghan Deans of Tor.com ultimately concluded that \\"while 'Vienen' works hard to hit its marks‚Äîa classic villain, a battle of dudes‚Äîit can‚Äôt measure up to all that‚Äôs come before it.\\" She surmised that \\"the transfer [from Mulder to Doggett] is functional, but the transfer is hollow.\\" She did, however, applaud the return of the black oil.

It premiered on the Fox network on . The episode was written by Greg Walker and directed by Barry K. Thomas. \\"Empedocles\\" is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. The episode received a Nielsen rating of 7.3 and was viewed by 7.46 million households and over 12.46 million viewers. Overall, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny), Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick), who work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) enlists Mulder's help investigating a killer's connection to the unsolved murder of Doggett's son, but Mulder soon finds himself clashing with Doggett. \\"Empedocles\\" was named after the famed Greek pre-Socratic philosopher of the same name. The episode marked the return of Special Agent Monica Reyes, who was first introduced in the earlier season eight episode \\"This is Not Happening\\". Reyes would later become Doggett's partner, in the show's ninth season. The episode included an elaborate special effects sequence wherein actor Jay Underwood rips off his face to reveal fire underneath his skin, which was created via green screen technology. Plot In New Orleans, mild-mannered white-collar worker Jeb Larold Dukes (Jay Underwood) is fired from his job. After he leaves the office, Jeb witnesses a car chase which ends in a fiery crash. A burning figure that only Jeb can see emerges from the wreck and seems to merge with him. Jeb, now possessed by the being, returns to his office to fatally shoot his boss and co-workers. Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) arrives at the crime scene and meets NOPD detective Franklin Potter, who has called her in out of his belief that the murders are related to satanism. Reyes merely answers the detective that it was not devil worship, and that the killer probably was under stress. As she is leaving, she witnesses one of the bodies carbonize into a charred corpse in front of her, only to have it revert to normal. Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) takes a pregnant Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to the hospital when she doubles over in pain. There, Reyes phones him to ask about the case, but Mulder cedes to the authority of John Doggett (Robert Patrick), who is formally running the X-Files. However, Reyes says she can't call Doggett since it is about him. Meanwhile, Jeb is in a hotel room in Georgia trying to shoot himself in the head. Suddenly, he notices something wrong with his face; he claws at his face, peeling away the skin to reveal burning embers beneath the skin. Mulder and Reyes meet in an FBI records room, where she divulges the story of Doggett's son Luke's murder: years ago, when Luke disappeared, the FBI were called in to investigate. Reyes was one of the agents on the case. They never found the killer, and when they discovered Luke's body, both Reyes and Doggett saw it transform into ashes instantly. Reyes says that Doggett has spent the last few years convincing himself he did not see it. Reyes believes it was a psychic clue, and now with the other crime scene, she has seen it again. Doggett soon attacks Mulder for looking into his son's case, but Reyes explains why they are investigating. She reveals that Bob Harvey, a suspect in Luke's murder, died in the car crash in New Orleans. Reyes stresses her vision's importance, but Doggett dismisses it. Reyes goes to visit Jeb's sister, Katha, and learns he did not know Bob Harvey. While Reyes is there, Katha receives a call from Jeb, but tells him to call later. As Jeb leaves the phone booth, he kills a female motorist. Meanwhile, Doggett learns from Scully that she has suffered a placental abruption. He asks her what made her start to believe in the paranormal. She says she realized she was \\"afraid to believe.\\" Scully later tells Mulder to keep trying to help Doggett. As Doggett approaches the body of Jeb's latest victim, he has a flashback of when he found Luke's body. Doggett storms off, but Reyes refuses to let it go, finally revealing her theory: she believes that the boy's murder was part of a \\"thread of evil,\\" an interconnected series of terrible events. Meanwhile, Katha returns home with her daughter and finds Jeb there. He insists that it wasn't him who committed the murder, and pleads to his sister for help. Katha calls the agents and tries to separate her daughter from Jeb, but he realizes what she is planning and uses his niece as a hostage. Before Jeb can shoot Doggett, Reyes incapacitates him with a round to the throat. Doggett finally embraces the memory of his vision. Mulder tells him that when he worked in violent crimes and saw the horrible things people did, he began to think of evil like a disease that infected people. Some lack immunity to this disease of evil because of some tragedy in their lives. Jeb dies while Reyes and Katha are in the room. After the doctors leave, Katha's eyes glow, much like Jeb's. She hits Reyes over the head with an oxygen tank and takes her gun. Before she can execute Reyes for killing her brother, Doggett appears and wrestles her to the ground. Production The episode was named after the famed philosopher right =Writing= The episode was written by Greg Walker and directed by Barry K. Thomas, marking his directoral debut.Hurwitz and Knowles, pp. 236‚Äì40. The episode takes its title from the famed Greek pre- Socratic philosopher of the same name. Empedocles believed that out of the four classic elements‚Äîearth, wind, fire, and water‚Äîfire was the most superior. As such, Empedocles is often associated with fire. According to legend recorded by Diogenes La√´rtius, in order to ascend to godhood, Empedocles threw himself into a volcano in Mount Etna. The episode marked the return of Special Agent Monica Reyes, who was first introduced in the earlier season eight episode \\"This is Not Happening\\". Although Reyes would later become Doggett's partner, the series attempted to differentiate the Doggett/Reyes relationship from the Mulder/Scully relationship. Robert Patrick later noted, \\"We're not going to try to duplicate [the Mulder and Scully relationship], we're not going to try to regenerate the magic chemistry.\\" However, he later did say \\"that Gillian and I had our own chemistry that was unique unto itself, and likewise with the addition of Annabeth. It was different.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 193. =Special effects= In order to create the \\"Lava Face\\" effect, actor Jay Underwood's face was painted green. A mask with pre-cut slits was then placed over the skin. Underwood then tore the mask off of his own face, revealing streaks of the green coloring. A matte of the scene was then cut and various fire effects were placed into Underwood's face via green screen technology. In order to make the \\"cracks\\" appear, digital technology was created to \\"smooth over\\" the skin and then slowly reveal the pre-cut slits. Producer Paul Rabwin later joked that Underwood \\"had fire for brains\\". Reception \\"Empedocles\\" first aired on Fox on April 22, 2001. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7.3, meaning that it was seen by 7.3% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 7.46 million households and over 12.46 million viewers. The episode ranked as the 40th most-watched episode for the week ending April 22. The episode subsequently aired in the United Kingdom on the BBC Two on July 28, 2002. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"The murder of Doggett's son is about to become an X-file.\\" Critical reception to the episode was mostly mixed. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode three-and-a-half stars out of five. The two noted that the \\"X-File in itself is an interesting concept, but left frustratingly vague.\\" Shearman and Pearson, however, did positively write that the episode is \\"a character study which gives its new leads some background and depth and, better yet, somewhere new to develop.\\"Shearman and Pearson, p. 245. VanDerWerff later awarded the episode an \\"C+\\" and wrote that \\"there are a lot of things to like in \\"Empedocles,\\" but the central conceit is just too stupid for the episode as a whole to work.\\" While she enjoyed the \\"way that [the episode] features all four FBI agents in the same episode\\", she was critical of both the plot and the Mulder and Scully dynamic, noting that it fell flat. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. She criticized several of the plot points in the episode, most notably how a \\"big- city\\" New Orleans detective could mistake Marilyn Manson CDs as signs of blatant satanic imagery. Vitaris further criticized the \\"sidelined\\" behavior of Scully and the \\"shoehorned\\" characterization of Reyes. Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, wrote a largely negative review of the episode. He criticized the downsized role Mulder and Scully played in the episode, noting that they had been \\"reduced to mere footnotes\\".Kessenich, p. 169. Furthermore, Kessenich reasoned that, by trying to \\"prep for [a] future\\" of just Doggett and Reyes and \\"[connect] to the past\\" with Mulder and Scully, the episode ultimately \\"served to remind us how Doggett and Reyes pale in comparison to the magic of Mulder and Scully.\\"Kessenich, p. 172. Not all reviews were negative. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode a B‚àí. Sarah Stegall awarded the episode five stars out of five and noted \\"Being dead has done wonders for Fox Mulder.\\" Stegall concluded that the episode \\"is one of the best episodes of the new era. Mulder and Scully get one last chance to remind us why we will miss them, and Doggett and Reyes get a chance to earn their stripes. [...] If this is the season where the torch gets passed, it's good to see that it's got one last flare in it.\\"  Notes FootnotesBibliography   External links  * *\\"Empedocles\\" at TV.com Category:2001 American television episodes Category:Television episodes set in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Television episodes set in Maryland Category:Television episodes set in New Orleans Category:Television episodes about Satanism Category:Television episodes set in South Carolina Category:The X-Files (season 8) episodes Category:Television episodes set in Washington, D.C.

It was written by executive producers Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz, and was directed by Tony Wharmby. \\"Deadalive\\" explores the series' alien mythology story arc. Following its North American premiere on April 1, 2001, it received a Nielsen household rating of 7.3 and was watched by 12.4 million viewers. \\"Deadalive\\" garnered mixed reviews from television critics; while most were happy with the return of actor David Duchovny, some criticized the episode's plot holes. It later won the show's last Emmy Award, for Outstanding Makeup. The season centers on Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)‚Äîfollowing the alien abduction and death of her former partner, Fox Mulder (Duchovny)‚Äîwho work on cases linked to the paranormal, known as X-Files. In this episode, agent Mulder is buried. After the body of alien abductee Billy Miles (Zachary Ansley) revives before an autopsy, assistant director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) orders Mulder's body to be exhumed. When Mulder's body is uncovered, weak vital signs are discovered. Meanwhile, rogue FBI agent Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) uses a nanobot infection in Skinner's blood as leverage to make him kill Scully's unborn child. Eventually, Mulder is revived and reunites with Scully. \\"Deadalive\\" was a story milestone for the series, re-introducing Duchovny after his abduction by aliens planning to colonize Earth in the seventh-season finale \\"Requiem\\". Spotnitz and Carter deliberately wrote and structured the episode in such a way so as to imply that Duchovny had been written out of the series. \\"Deadalive\\" featured several elaborate-make-up scenes, which head make-up effects artist Matthew Mungle was given only six days to complete. The episode has been analyzed for its themes of disease, suffering, healing, salvation and resurrection; Mulder seemingly rising from the dead has been seen as an allusion to the resurrection of Jesus. PlotBackground= In the seventh-season finale \\"Requiem\\", FBI special agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) was abducted by aliens.Shapiro (2000), pp. 266‚Äì277. In the eighth-season premiere \\"Within\\", John Doggett (Robert Patrick) took his place on the X-Files, and worked with Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) to find Mulder. In \\"This Is Not Happening\\", Scully, Doggett and FBI assistant director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) discovered several returned abductees. Although nearly all were in critical condition, a UFO cult, led by the mysterious Absalom (Judson Scott), was using Jeremiah Smith's (Roy Thinnes) healing powers to treat the abductees. Scully headed to their compound, only to discover Mulder's deceased body in the woods. =Events= Three months after Mulder's funeral, Doggett is offered a transfer from the X-Files. He realizes that if he leaves, the office will be closed, as Scully will soon be on maternity leave. Meanwhile, a fishing trawler finds the decomposing body of Billy Miles (Zachary Ansley)‚Äîan alien abductee who was taken at the same time as Mulder. When Miles revives on the autopsy table, Skinner, despite Doggett's objections, orders that Mulder's body be exhumed and brought to a hospital, fearing that he may have been buried alive. When the casket is opened, a decomposing Mulder, contrary to all scientific expectations, shows weak vital signs. Meanwhile, Scully notices that Miles (now on life support) has two heartbeats. At the FBI, Deputy Director Alvin Kersh unsuccessfully tries to convince Doggett to stop investigating Mulder's apparent death. A short while later, as Skinner walks down a hallway, Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) activates nanobots that he had previously placed in Skinner's bloodstream as blackmail. Skinner stumbles in pain, and in an elevator, Krycek reveals himself and explains that he has a vaccine which could save Mulder's life. However, he will only give it if Skinner can ensure that Scully does not give birth to her baby for reasons that he does not disclose. Later, alone in his hospital bed, Miles regains consciousness and goes to take a shower. While doing so, his decaying flesh falls away, revealing a healthy body beneath. He tries to persuade Scully and Doggett that the aliens who abducted him are trying to save humanity. Scully, however, gets a lab report which reveals that Miles's DNA has substantially changed; he is now a new being. Skinner later tells Scully that there is a cure for Mulder's disease, but does not explain Krycek's demands. From her medical findings, Scully discovers that an alien virus is keeping the abductees alive long enough to cause a radical genetic transformation to take place, similar to the one that Miles experienced. After Scully tells Doggett about the transformation, he visits Absalom, who believes that the abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer Earth. Skinner‚Äîtorn by his decision‚Äîdecides to euthanize Mulder by pulling him off life support so that Krycek does not get his way. Doggett, however, catches Skinner in his attempt. Skinner explains Krycek's demands, but Doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either Scully's child will die, or Mulder will succumb to the virus. Doggett tries to locate Krycek in the parking lot of FBI Headquarters, but Krycek nearly runs him down with a car and destroys the vaccine before escaping. Dejected, Doggett returns to the hospital and tells Skinner he was right not to trust Krycek. He finds Scully preparing Mulder for the now-destroyed vaccine; she tells Doggett that keeping Mulder on life support was hastening the virus, and that Skinner effectively saved Mulder's life by pulling him off. She states that she will be able to use a combination of antiviral drugs to kill the virus if they can get him and his temperature to stabilize. Later, Scully is sitting by Mulder's bedside when he regains consciousness. He stares blankly at Scully, and asks, \\"Who are you?\\" At first, Scully thinks that Mulder does not remember her. However, she quickly realizes that he is actually playing a practical joke. They laugh, and Mulder asks, \\"Did anybody miss me?\\" Scully responds with tears. Later at the FBI, Kersh expresses his disappointment that Doggett did not take his advice to abandon Mulder's case and rescinds his offer to promote him. Doggett indicates that he will continue to work on the X-Files with Scully and Mulder. ProductionWriting= alt=The image is of two men sitting at a table signing items.

At the beginning of season seven, several cast and crew members felt it would be the show's last.Pergament, Alan (January 18, 1999). Chris Carter Feels 'X-Files' Will End By Spring of 2000. The Buffalo News (Berkshire Hathaway). Retrieved August 6, 2009. Desiring closure if the show was cancelled, X-Files creator Chris Carter brought back several characters from the series' pilot for the season finale \\"Requiem\\"; this included most notably Billy Miles, played by Zachary Ansley. After an eighth season of the show was confirmed, the mythology of the ongoing alien story arc for the series changed for both practical and artistic reasons. Former series lead David Duchovny left full-time participation in the series after a lengthy lawsuit during the previous season.Kessenich (2002), p. 80. To replace him, the show's producers hired Robert Patrick, although Duchovny eventually agreed to return for half of season eight's episodes. As such, \\"Deadalive\\" was one of the first episodes that Duchovny participated in full-time.Kessenich (2002), p. 145. Further, Frank Spotnitz, executive producer and co-writer of \\"Deadalive\\", noted that the original mythology of the show had been \\"wrapped up\\" much earlier in \\"One Son\\" and \\"Closure\\".Spotnitz (2005), 33:36‚Äì34:02. To create a \\"new chapter\\" in the mythology, and to work around Duchovny's absence, the storyline for the eighth season focused largely on the search for Mulder in the first half and the introduction of Super Soldiers in the second.Spotnitz (2005), 8:42‚Äì10:47. Due to the change in style and actors, Carter felt that the eighth season of The X-Files was the end of the \\"Mulder- Scully era\\". Spotnitz wanted \\"Deadalive\\" to open in a way that would shock viewers and make them watch the entire episode. He concluded that the best way to do this was to show Mulder's funeral. He felt that \\"the death of the hero [of the series] was shocking enough\\", but that no one expected \\"Deadalive\\" to blatantly open with a funeral.Spotnitz (2005), 0:27‚Äì0:47. He elaborated, \\"But here we are actually burying the man... just pushing something as far as you possibly can because the audience can't quite believe you're doing it.\\"Spotnitz (2005), 0:47‚Äì0:55. The funeral was expensive to film; several actors, such as Sheila Larken, who played Scully's mother, needed to be flown in specifically for the scene. Spotnitz later said, \\"It's a lot of money to spend but, you know, you just couldn't really do Mulder's funeral without having them there, so we did all that.\\"Spotnitz (2005), 1:21‚Äì1:40. Despite the fact that the show was filmed in California and under \\"huge financial pressure\\", real snow was used for foreground shotsSpotnitz (2005), 0:59‚Äì1:09. and the background was painted white in post-production.Spotnitz (2005), 1:09‚Äì1:16. Spotnitz later called the sequence \\"a fun scene to write and stage\\" and \\"a great tease\\".Spotnitz (2005), 0:20‚Äì026.Spotnitz (2005), 1:50‚Äì1:54. On Duchovny's request, Spotnitz and Carter wrote a larger role for Skinner than usual,Spotnitz (2005), 36:03‚Äì36:11. giving him the \\"moral dilemma\\" of whether or not to kill Scully's unborn child or Mulder.Spotnitz (2005), 30:57‚Äì31:08. In the end, Spotnitz called the effects of his actions, particularly the aftermath of taking Mulder off life support, a \\"nice sort of unexpected turn\\".Spotnitz (2005), 39:33‚Äì39:43. Scully's role in \\"Deadalive\\" was partly based on the 1954 film Magnificent Obsession, in which a young man's behavior causes him to accidentally blind a woman. To atone for this turn of events, he becomes a doctor to cure her. Spotnitz noted, \\"that movie was on my mind and not in a good way when we were imagining Scully in this operating room where Mulder was being worked on.\\"Spotnitz (2005), 38:45‚Äì39:19. =Filming and effects= \\"Deadalive\\" was the second episode directed by Tony Wharmby, after the Spotnitz-penned \\"Via Negativa\\". Spotnitz later praised the directing of \\"Deadalive\\" as \\"fantastic\\".Spotnitz (2005), 7:06‚Äì7:08. The majority of the episode‚Äîlike others from seasons six to nine‚Äîwas filmed in and around the Los Angeles area.Fraga (2010). Spotnitz managed to secure sufficient funds to enable the fishing trawler scene to be filmed off the Los Angeles coast, a situation with which he was \\"very pleased\\".Spotnitz (2005), 6:43‚Äì6:45. He also said that after the series' move from Vancouver following the fifth season, the J. Edgar Hoover Building set became more important to the show than before. For this reason, the scene in which Skinner collapses was filmed almost entirely on an FBI hallway set. This sequence recalls the sixth-season episode \\"S.R. 819\\", which featured Skinner being poisoned with nanobots by Krycek.Spotnitz (2005), 18:27‚Äì19:02. alt=The image is of red strawberry jelly. Make-up effects artist Matthew Mungle was responsible for portraying the decomposition of Mulder's and Miles's bodies. Spotnitz was particularly impressed with Miles's autopsy scene, calling it \\"something new to do [in the] late stage of the game\\".Spotnitz (2005), 7:38‚Äì7:45. Since human bodies which have decomposed in water become \\"grotesque[ly]... disfigured\\", Miles's body was \\"a toned-down version of what the reality would be.\\"Spotnitz (2005), 8:17‚Äì8:19. To create the scene, plaster bandages were used to create a cast of the front and back of Ansley's body; these, in turn, were used to create a fiberglass cast. This was sculpted over with water clay to create the appearance of a bloated body. Afterwards, a mold of the clay was made and a body suit created with latex. As the project proceeded, Mungle sent photos to Carter, who gave final approval. In Miles's shower scene, a mix of \\"red goo\\", which included strawberry jam, was placed on Ansley's skin. Fake skin, created from thin pieces of urethane, was then placed on top of this mixture and warm water was pumped through to create the illusion of shedding flesh. Mungle reportedly had only six days to complete the prosthetics for the episode. Mungle later noted that after being told what the scene would entail he asked, \\"if we can figure something out, could we show it on TV?\\" While the studio approved the footage, Spotnitz later called the sequence \\"awfully graphic\\"; he was surprised the sequence got past censors since it would be difficult to show in a PG-rated film.Spotnitz (2005), 22:24‚Äì22:26. Due to Duchovny's contract, he was available for shooting only on certain days. Spotnitz commented on the irony of \\"paying all this money to get [Duchovny's] services for a limited time\\" only to have him spend most of the episode \\"in a hospital bed, semi-dead\\".Spotnitz (2005), 2:24‚Äì2:30. He later lamented the limited access to Duchovny as it prevented the \\"most satisfying use of the actor or character\\".Spotnitz (2005), 2:38‚Äì2:42. Some scenes featuring Mulder were filmed using different people. For instance, the scene in which Mulder is exhumed was filmed with a double who wore a mask of Duchovny's face. Head make-up artist Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf later said \\"It was brilliant, because nobody knew that.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles (2008), p. 192. For the shots of the stunt double as well as of Duchovny later in the episode, she used egg whites and a facial mask to give Mulder's skin a \\"really cool, old, dried-up cracked skin effect.\\" Themes Mulder's revival has been compared to alt=The image is a painting of the resurrection of Jesus. \\"Deadalive\\", along with other eighth-season episodes, explores the themes of \\"human resurrection and salvation... disease, suffering, and healing\\". These emerged in the season's premiere, \\"Within\\", when Scully is shown Mulder's tombstone. The arc would continue in \\"The Gift\\", which explored the implications of Mulder's inoperable brain tumor and featured the resurrection of a temporarily deceased John Doggett. In \\"Deadalive\\", the theme of resurrection reappears in full force: Billy Miles is found dead but revives. Likewise, Mulder is buried for three months, but is brought back to life. This sub-theme would continue into the ninth season in episodes such as \\"Audrey Pauley\\".Kellner (2003), p. 155. The episode is one of many to feature Mulder as a Christlike figure. In We Want to Believe, Amy Donaldson writes that the episode is the most dramatic of Mulder's \\"multiple resurrections\\". She compares his resurrection to Jesus's, who Mulder \\"outdo[es]\\" by \\"staying in the grave for three months instead of simply three days.\\"Donaldson (2011), p. 11. During Mulder's funeral the minister reads John 11:25‚Äì26: \\"Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die\\". According to scripture, Jesus spoke these words when he raised Lazarus of Bethany from the dead, and many biblical scholars note that the verse foreshadows his own resurrection. Previously, in the seventh-season's \\"Millennium\\", the verse was used by a necromancer, but for the wrong reason. The necromancer wanted to raise the dead by reciting the verse, but only their bodies returned as zombies. In \\"Deadalive\\", Mulder returns from the dead in both mind and body.Donaldson (2011), pp. 210‚Äì211. Donaldson also draws parallels between the eighth season of the show and the Gospels, and between the ninth season and the Acts of the Apostles. In the Gospels, Jesus is brought back to life but then leaves his followers, allowing them to spread his message; this is recorded in Acts, the fifth book of the New Testament. In The X-Files, Mulder follows a similar course. After returning to life in \\"Deadalive\\", he investigates several cases before disappearing at the beginning of season nine in \\"Nothing Important Happened Today\\". During the ninth season, his quest is continued by Scully, Doggett and Monica Reyes. ReceptionRatings and release= \\"Deadalive\\" premiered on American television on April 1, 2001. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7.3 with an 11-percent share, meaning it was viewed by 7.3 percent of all television-equipped households, and 11 percent of those watching television. It was watched by 12.4 million viewers overall. It won for Outstanding Makeup For a Series at the 53rd Primetime Emmy Awards in 2001;Hurwitz and Knowles (2008), p. 241. it would be the last Emmy win for The X-Files. \\"Deadalive\\" was first released as a single-episode DVD in the United Kingdom on August 6, 2001, for Region 2. On November 4, 2003, the episode was released as part of the eighth season DVD box set. The episode was later included on The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 ‚Äì Super Soldiers, a DVD collection of episodes in the Super Soldiers story arc. =Reviews= alt=A man with dark brown hair is smirking and looking near the camera. The episode received mixed reviews; many critics praised the return of Fox Mulder, although others felt that the episode had various plot holes and was overcomplicated. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave \\"Deadalive\\" a full five stars and called its humor and simplistic plot the \\"icing on the cake.\\" They praised its stylistic difference from the preceding episode, \\"This Is Not Happening\\", which they described as \\"atmospheric and doom-laden\\". The two called \\"Deadalive\\" a \\"slice of sci-fi hokum, with action scenes, bits of grisly horror [and] a reexamination of the show's mythology\\".Shearman and Pearson (2010), p. 243. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an \\"A‚àí\\" and wrote, \\"Never go away again, David! I take back everything bad I ever said about you! I love you as much as ever!\\" Likewise George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of the Contra Costa Times praised the on-screen return of characters such as Mulder and Krycek. They felt so many eighth-season episodes worked well because \\"Chris Carter seems to be taking an even more active role in the series that is most closely identified with him.\\" Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B+\\" and wrote that, \\"it‚Äôs a measure of a show‚Äôs effectiveness to see how convincingly the writers can threaten a major character, and have that character‚Äôs subsequent survival not be a cheat\\", in regards to Mulder's resurrection. He applauded the fact that the episode is suspenseful, even though the ending has a certain inevitability. Handlen also positively commented on both Anderson's performance‚Äîalthough pointing out that she \\"is largely pushed to the side for the majority\\" of the episode‚Äîand Lea's reappearance, noting that \\"it's always fun to see Krycek\\". However, he argued that the conclusion \\"makes less sense the more you think about it\\", but that the final scene with Mulder and Scully \\"makes up for the contrivance.\\" Not all reviews were positive. Paula Vitaris from CFQ gave the episode one-and-a-half stars out of four. She criticized its storyline, noting a number of plot holes‚Äîsuch as Mulder's survival for three months without food or water‚Äîand the fact that his body was neither autopsied nor embalmed. Tom Kessenich, in Examination: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6‚Äì9 of the X-Files, called the plot \\"wooden and convoluted\\" and felt that it \\"set the stage for... the countdown toward the end of Fox Mulder's time on The X-Files\\". However, he complimented Anderson on her \\"effective\\" performance.Kessenich (2002), pp. 163, 165. SFX magazine ranked the episode as the sixth \\"Top 10 Resurrections\\", reasoning that it allowed Mulder to be around for the series finale a year later. However, the magazine felt his return made \\"poor Robert Patrick‚Äôs Agent Doggett a bit superfluous\\", and that the plot was rather complicated. In a list comparing Fringe episodes with those of the X-Files, UGO Networks writer Alex Zalben named \\"Deadalive\\" as the best resurrection story, beating out Fringes \\"Unearthed\\". Zalben cited the \\"emotional reunion at the end\\" as the deciding factor, though \\"both [episodes] kind of suck\\".

It premiered on the Fox network on . Written by Frank Spotnitz and series creator Chris Carter, and directed by Kim Manners, the episode helps to explore the series' overarching mythology. \\"Per Manum\\" received a Nielsen rating of 9.4 and was watched by 9.61 million households. Overall, the episode received mostly positive reviews from critics. The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)‚Äîfollowing the alien abduction of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)‚Äîwho work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Scully and Doggett investigate several women who had no way of naturally conceiving but who claim to have been abducted and impregnated with alien babies. Soon, Scully begins to worry about the future of her pregnancy. \\"Per Manum\\" featured a substantial appearance by Duchovny who had elected not to return to the show as a full-time main character following the ending of season seven. In addition, the episode marks the first appearance of Knowle Rohrer, played by Adam Baldwin. The episode's title means \\"by hand\\" in Latin.  Plot  Pregnant Kathy McCready is undergoing an emergency caesarean. As her husband prepares, the ward is locked down, and the child delivered is seen to be an alien. FBI special agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) meet Duffy Haskell (Jay Acovone), who tells them about his wife‚Äîa multiple-abductee who he believes was killed by her doctors upon giving birth to an alien child. He also describes how his wife's cancer was both caused and cured by her abductors. Duffy refers the agents to Zeus Genetics in Maryland, and shows them an ultrasound scan that seems to vindicate his story. As the agents leave, Doggett notes similarities between the case and Scully's history, although he does not yet know that she is pregnant. In a flashback, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) tells Scully that her abduction has rendered her infertile, as her ova were harvested for genetic experiments. Mulder later found them in a secret facility, but they were not viable. At Zeus Genetics, Scully overhears a pregnant woman, Mary Hendershot (Saxon Trainor), who is telling her doctor that she no longer wants to be under his care. In order to avoid being seen, Scully hides in a storeroom, finding it full of preserved fetuses that resemble the alien child seen earlier, but she is discovered by a Dr. Lev. Scully then phones Dr. Parenti, who is dissecting an alien fetus, and asks him to compare her ultrasound scan with the one given to her earlier. Later, while waiting to be attended to by Parenti, she has another flashback, recalling the time she sought a second opinion about her ova from Parenti and was told that her ova might be viable with a sperm donor. In the present, she is called in to be attended to, and she is then assured her scans are in order. Later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Doggett confront Duffy about threatening letters he has sent to both Mulder and Lev. However, when the agents leave, Duffy makes a phone call to Lev, warning him that they are being investigated. In another flashback, Scully asks Mulder to be the donor, to which he happily agrees. Scully is warned by Mary that their unborn children are in danger. Scully meets Doggett and Skinner, having requested a leave of absence from the FBI. After Doggett leaves, Skinner tries to convince Scully to reveal her pregnancy to him. Scully and Mary visit an army research hospital to have Mary's labor induced. Whilst Mary is being prepped for the operation, Scully asks to have an ultrasound performed on herself. The scan appears normal, but Scully realises the monitor they are watching is simply a video of another woman's scan. Realising they have been tricked, Scully finds Mary and the two sneak out of the exam room. Doggett discovers that Duffy's fingerprints belong to a man who died thirty years previously. Doggett contacts an old military partner, Knowle Rohrer (Adam Baldwin) to find his real identity. Although Rohrer assures Doggett he will investigate, the agent is not convinced, believing that Duffy is a CIA agent. Doggett confides this to Skinner, who tells him to aid Scully at the military hospital. As Scully and Mary sneak out of the building, they are found by Rohrer and several marines, claiming Doggett has sent them to rescue her. The women are driven away, but Mary enters labour and Scully is drugged. When she wakens, Doggett informs her that Mary's baby was delivered and is normal. However, Scully is convinced something is amiss, but nothing more can be done about it. In another flashback, Scully tells Mulder that her attempt at in vitro fertilization has failed, but he tells her to \\"never give up on a miracle\\". Production right \\"Per Manum\\" featured the appearance of David Duchovny as Fox Mulder in various flashbacks. After settling his contract dispute with Fox, Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the seventh season. In order to explain Mulder's absence, Duchovny's character was abducted by aliens in the seventh season finale, \\"Requiem\\". After several rounds of contractual discussions, Duchovny agreed to return for a total of 11 season eight episodes. \\"Per Manum\\" marked the fourth appearance of Duchovny in the eighth season; he had previously appeared in opening episodes of the season, \\"Within\\" and \\"Without\\" as well as the eleventh episode \\"The Gift\\". Series creator Chris Carter later argued that Mulder's absences from the series did not affect the series, noting that \\"there are characters who can be powerful as absent centers, as Mulder was through the eighth and ninth seasons.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 189 A deleted scene from early on within the episode, in which Scully questions her doctor about her ultrasound scans, was cut from the final broadcast as writer Frank Spotnitz felt it was too \\"confusing\\" for the viewers to place doubt on the actions of the doctor so early. Fellow series writer John Shiban said that the scene was not \\"subtle\\" enough to convey the right level of suspicion. Spotnitz has described \\"Per Manum\\" as being \\"a real paranoia episode\\", concerning \\"the way you perceive connections between people, what are they saying, and is it suspicious or not\\". Adam Baldwin, who makes his first appearance as recurring character Knowle Rohrer, originally auditioned for the part of John Doggett, losing out to Robert Patrick. However, the crew remembered Baldwin's audition later when casting \\"Per Manum\\", and asked him to play the role. Jay Acovone, who portrays Duffy Haskel in this episode, returned in the same role in the season's penultimate episode \\"Essence\\"; and had also previously appeared in the fourth season episode \\"Demons\\". \\"Per Manum\\" also featured a guest appearance by Mark Snow as an unnamed doctor. Snow had been the series' composer since the first season.  Broadcast and reception  \\"Per Manum\\" premiered on the Fox network on and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 9.4, meaning that it was seen by 9.4% of the nation's estimated households. It was viewed by 9.61 million households and 16 million viewers, making it, at the time, the highest-rated episode of The X-Files to air during the season. \\"Per Manum\\" ranked as the 30th most- watched episode for the week ending February 18. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"How did Scully get pregnant?\\" The episode was later included on The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 ‚Äì Super Soldiers, a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien super soldiers arc. \\"Per Manum\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B+\\" and called it \\"good\\". She appreciated the fact that the show revealed that Mulder was possibly the father of Scully's child, saying that it \\"ups the stakes in a lot of ways and redefines [Scully's] mission\\" to find Mulder. Despite this, VanDerWerff noted that the episode \\"has some issues\\", largely due to the convoluted nature of the mythology at this point in the show's run, as well as the fact that Duchovny looked \\"a little bored\\" at times. However, she wrote that the episode, along with the subsequent episode \\"This is Not Happening\\" was a showcase for Anderson's acting ability, and her performance \\"knits all of this together\\". Writing for Television Without Pity, Jessica Morgan rated the episode a \\"B+\\", deriding some of the episode's plot points, such as the hospital's locking doors, and questioning the villainy of the antagonistic doctors. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode five stars out of five, calling it a \\"return to form\\" for the series. Shearman and Pearson also felt that the episode gave the character of John Doggett a chance to be accepted by the series' other characters; and praised the \\"subtle\\" writing of the episode's emotional dialogue.Shearman and Pearson, pp. 239‚Äì240 Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations: An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6-9 of 'The X-Files', noted that the episode typifies the basic themes of the series‚Äî\\"dark, foreboding terror, overriding sense of paranoia\\" and \\"the fear of the unknown\\" among others.Kessenich, p.156. Writing for The Vindicator, Eric Mink felt that the episode was \\"intense, unsettling, sometimes gross, and suspenseful to the point of nerve-racking \\", feeling that its plot would \\"resonate instantly and ominously with viewers\\". Meghan Deans of Tor.com felt that, while the episode did unfortunately reduce Scully down to a traditional idea of feminine identity for part of its run, it was \\"one of the most emotional Scully-centric episodes the show has ever given us.\\" Furthermore, Deans reasoned that the episode was an example of \\"what The X-Files would have been, had Scully been the believer: a woman being told that she is hysterical, a woman being told that she imagined it all [and] a woman being told that the evidence of her own body is invalid\\", a direction that would have been \\"startling \\". Not all reviews were positive. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it no stars out of four. She heavily derided the plot, noting that Haskell's role as an \\"undercover operative\\" was not convincing. Furthermore, she reasoned that because the plot twists were so expected, Scully came off as \\"a moron\\". Vitaris also criticized the use of flashbacks, noting that they were \\"the only way The X-Files writers could figure out to use David Duchovny\\".

It premiered on the Fox network on . The episode was written by Frank Spotnitz and directed by Richard Compton. \\"Medusa\\" is a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\" story, unconnected to the series' wider mythology. The episode received a Nielsen rating of 8.2 and was viewed by 13.8 million viewers. Overall, the episode received mixed reviews from critics. The series centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)‚Äîfollowing the alien abduction of her former partner, Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)‚Äîwho work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, a string of bizarre deaths in the tunnels of the Boston subway system sees Doggett join a team of professionals underground to investigate. Meanwhile, Scully has to defy the train authorities above ground, who are determined to get the trains up and running within hours. \\"Medusa\\" was allotted a \\"huge budget\\", due mostly to the fact that a replica of the Boston subway had to be recreated. Robert Patrick later called the eventual set \\"the biggest damned thing I'd seen in my life.\\" Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf and Matthew Mungle, the show's make-up effect producers, used several unorthodox ingredients to create the effect of melted flesh; in addition to the use of normal prosthetic make-up, the two also used a combination of figs and Fruit Roll-Ups. Plot In Boston, an undercover cop waits for the subway, alone. Suddenly, a suspicious man appears, jumping the fare barrier. Eventually, they both get onto a train and the police officer draws his gun as the man starts to walk towards him from behind. Suddenly, the subway comes to a screeching halt, flashes of light are seen, and the train loses power. Later, when the train is back up and running, a batch of commuters enter the subway car and find the undercover cop with the flesh on half his face and his left arm stripped down to the bone. Agents Scully and Doggett arrive at the operations center to investigate. However, they are rudely greeted by Deputy Chief Karras and Lieutenant Bianco of the transit police; the two eagerly want the FBI to get the job done fast so that the subways can be reopened in five hours, and Karras is also irritated that Scully performed an autopsy on the body. Even after an autopsy, Scully has no idea what killed the man, and the CDC is unable to find any biological or chemical agents in the subway. Doggett and Scully are soon introduced to a strike-force that will be going into the subway to investigate. The group includes Steven Melnick, a structural engineer, and Dr. Hellura Lyle, CDC employee specializing in pathogens. Scully, however, decides the plan will work better if Doggett acts as her eyes and ears while she analyzes the situation from up in the Transit Control Center. Using cameras and microphones, she will watch and hear what is happening. After the plans are made, Doggett leads the team into the dark tunnel. While in the tunnels, Melnick gets a burn on the back of his neck suggesting a chemical leak. However, the test of the nearby puddle shows nothing dangerous: it is just salt water. Melnick mentions that the tunnels run along the harbor in some places and that they get sea water leakages from time to time. Moving ahead, the team finds an abandoned section of the subway tunnels. Out of the tunnel bursts a man with his rib cage and teeth exposed who knocks Doggett down: he is the suspected robber, eaten away like the other man. His condition proves that he did not kill the man and that there may, in fact, be a contagion. While looking around, the teams discover three bodies with the same gruesome injuries, wrapped in plastic. It soon becomes clear that someone is covering up the problem in the subway. Lyle spots an unknown person running away from them in the subway and the team follows. When the group approaches the spot where the train lost power, Melnick starts crying out in pain. Visible electrical flashes start destroying the skin on his left arm. Scully tells Doggett to pour water on it, which stops the flashes. Lyle takes the badly injured Melnick to the surface and Doggett continues onward with Bianco. When Melnick returns to the surface, he seems to be getting worse, but Lyle appears healthy. Scully then sees the three bodies being taken away by non-CDC hazmat people. When Scully confronts Karras about this, he says that he is organizing it. Scully tells Karras that she has already organized the CDC to collect the bodies and accuses Karras of attempting a cover-up. Although Karras tries to deny his involvement, he eventually allows her to send the bodies to the actual CDC. Back in the tunnels, Doggett notices a green glow on Bianco in a dimly lit former subway station. As such, he refuses to allow the lieutenant to leave. Bianco runs away, forcing Doggett to give chase. He learns from Scully that Karras has gone ahead of plan and allowed the passengers onto the platforms and the subway will start back up, despite the danger. After analyzing various water samples found at the scene, Scully meets with Dr. Kai Bowe, a marine biologist, who explains that the sample contains a unique microscopic sea creature called a medusa which are made out of calcium and are bioluminescent. However, Bowe does not know why the electrical reaction happens. When Doggett finds the wounded Bianco, he finds that his condition has gotten worse. Doggett then carries Bianco on his back and helps him continue through the tunnels. They soon encounter a boy with no signs of the luminous green substance on him. Scully realizes that sweat is causing the chemical electrical reaction since it is conductive to calcium ions. The boy does not have well developed sweat glands yet so the medusas are not affecting him. Doggett follows the boy to a major leak from the bay with the green glow on all the walls. Suddenly, an oncoming subway approaches the group‚ÄîKarras has allowed the subway to resume schedule. Doggett uses Bianco's gun as an electrical conductor from the third rail to the electrolytic water, killing the medusas and preventing further exposure. Later, Scully comes to see Doggett in the hospital. She informs him that Bianco and Melnick are with plastic surgeons, the boy has been given to social services, and no criminal charges will be pressed against Karras since the electrical discharge from the third rail destroyed the proof of the medusas in the tunnel. Production right \\"Medusa\\" was written by executive producer Frank Spotnitz and directed by Richard Compton. Reportedly, because of the scope of the episode, a \\"huge budget\\" was allotted for the entry. The subway set created for this episode was designed to mirror the actual Boston subway. According to co-star Robert Patrick, \\"They got us in there, and we did it, and they built a huge subway tunnel set on a soundstage.\\" Patrick later described the set as \\"the biggest damned thing I'd ever seen in my life.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 189. In real life, the Boston subway system is \\"fondly\\" called the T, short for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority. In \\"Medusa\\", the \\"T\\", was changed to an \\"M\\" \\"for fictional purposes\\". Cheri Montesanto-Medcalf and Matthew Mungle, the show's make-up effect producers, used several unorthodox ingredients to create the effect of melted flesh; in addition to the use of normal prosthetic make-up, the two also used a combination of figs and Fruit Roll-Ups. Several of the characters in the episode were named after real-life individuals: First, the characters of Hellura Lyle and Kai Bowe were named after two Writers Guild trainees who served in The X-Files writing room. Second, the character Steven Melnick is named after the Vice President of Media Relations for 20th Century Fox Television. Melnick had formerly served as the publicist for the series. Broadcast and reception \\"Medusa\\" first aired on Fox on February 11, 2001. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.2, meaning that it was seen by 8.2% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 8.27 million households, and 13.8 million viewers. The episode ranked as the 41st most-watched episode for the week ending February 11. The episode subsequently debuted in the United Kingdom on the BBC Two on May 26, 2002. Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"Underneath the street lies the ultimate in terror.\\" Critical reception to the episode was mostly mixed. Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode a \\"B\\". Despite the moderate praise, however, Morgan did make a jest at the portrayal of the subway in the show, noting that it was not realistic; she wrote that the set was the \\"cleanest, emptiest subway station in world [‚Ä¶] No urine. No trash. It's nicer than my apartment, really.\\" Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen gave the episode a mixed review and rated it two-and-a-half stars out of five. Despite writing that \\"on paper ['Medusa' is] the right episode at the right time\\", the two criticized the episode, noting that \\"the teaser never really makes sense in light of the relations offered, the appearance of the mute boy is a messy contrivance, and the ending is too abrupt.\\"Shearman and Pearson, p. 238-39. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"B‚Äì\\". While noting that the episode possessed \\"a few decent ideas, and a wasted setting\\", the \\"story never sparks\\". He largely blamed the episode's antagonistic organism, noting that they are not \\"all that memorable\\" and \\"not even all that monster-y\\". Despite this, he wrote positively of the show's use of Scully, arguing that, \\"the fun of the episode is watching Scully watch Doggett and his team ‚Ä¶ slowly work through the closed off subway tunnels, finding bodies wrapped in plastic and other mysteries beside.\\" Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a slightly negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Despite noting, \\"after episodes about butt-crawling and vomiting, it's a relief to have one in which people die when their skin and muscles are fried away by microscopic sea creatures called medusas\\", Vitaris was critical of the plot, likening it to \\"cliche[d]\\" 1970's movies that featured the \\"obstreperous official insisting the plane must fly or the skyscraper is fire-proof, even when the potential for catastrophe is staring him in the face.\\" Spotnitz later admitted during a Reddit IAmA that the episode was his least-favorite that he had written because \\"the concept just wasn't clear or compelling enough to sustain the hour.\\"  Notes FootnotesBibliography * *  External links  * *\\"Medusa\\" at TV.com Category:2001 American television episodes Category:Television episodes set in Boston Category:The X-Files (season 8) episodes Category:Underground railways in fiction ","title":"Medusa (The X-Files)"},{"id":"21777195","text":"\\"The Gift\\" is the eleventh episode of the eighth season of the American science fiction television series The X-Files. It premiered on the Fox network in the United States on . The episode was written by Frank Spotnitz and directed by Kim Manners. \\"The Gift\\" has elements of both a \\"Monster-of-the- Week\\" episode, and an entry in the series' mythology. The episode received a Nielsen rating of 8.8 and was viewed by 14.6 million viewers. Overall, the episode received largely mixed reviews from television critics; while many appreciated the return focus on Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) absence, others felt that the plot revelations were unnaturally forced into the show. The season centers on FBI special agents Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and her new partner John Doggett (Robert Patrick)‚Äîfollowing the alien abduction of her former partner, Mulder‚Äîwho work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, Doggett comes upon an old case about a professed \\"soul-eater\\" that he hopes will ultimately prove the truth behind Mulder's abduction. In a series of flashbacks, it is revealed that, after his exposure to an alien artifact, Mulder was slowly dying of a brain disease. In an attempt to heal himself, he tracked down the soul eater a year before the events of the episode, but felt pity for the creature. In the present, Doggett is shot and killed by the local sheriff, but the soul eater consumes his death and is finally allowed to die, resurrecting Doggett in the process. \\"The Gift\\" featured the first substantial appearance of Duchovny since the season opener; he had elected not to return to the show as a full-time main character following the season seven finale. The episode was written by Spotnitz and was based on folklore surrounding the soul eater. Gillian Anderson, who did not appear in the episode, save for stock footage, later revealed that she was grateful for the time off because it allowed her to spend more time with her daughter. The episode has been analyzed for its themes of death and resurrection, its use of a medicine wheel as a motif, and it has been compared and contrasted with the fourth season episode \\"Leonard Betts\\".  Plot Background= FBI special agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) is currently missing, having been abducted by aliens in the seventh season finale, \\"Requiem.\\" His partner Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) has been working with Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) in order to locate him. Shortly after Mulder was abducted, Scully and Doggett learned that he had been suffering from a brain tumor and was nearing his demise. After a false lead in the Arizona desert early in the year, Doggett has been assigned to the X-Files division, but he has continued his search for Mulder, despite a lack of definite leads. =Events= A man‚Äîwhose face is hidden from the camera‚Äîdrives up to and enters a house, which has an ominous symbol drawn in blood on the door. When he's inside, a humanoid creature approaches a woman but the mysterious man shoots the creature three times. As he returns to his car his identity is finally revealed: Fox Mulder. Doggett investigates a possible lead into Mulder's disappearance in Squamash, Pennsylvania. Apparently, in the spring of 2000, Mulder visited the town searching for something to cure his terminal brain disease that he received via exposure to an alien artifact. Doggett is informed by the local sheriff (Michael McGrady) that Mulder was investigating a case involving Marie Hangemuhl (Natalie Radford). Marie was told by her sister about a Native American legend of a creature that lives in the woods. While interrogating the Hangemuhls in the present, Doggett learns that Marie is suffering from terminal renal failure. As he is leaving, he also notices plastered-over gunshot holes in their wall. Later, at Mulder's apartment, Doggett finds a gun he kept hidden under his sink. Meanwhile, in Squamash, a backhoe digs at a stone circle located in the town cemetery. Later that night, the townsfolk show up at a cabin in the woods, demanding to a rustic woman (Caroline Lagerfelt) living there that \\"it\\" be sent out. A creature attempts to escape, but it is captured. Doggett and Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) return to Squamash and ask the sheriff about the murder of an unidentified transient, who Doggett believes that the transient was killed by Mulder. Doggett and Skinner travel to the cemetery and discover that the grave dug up by the backhoe earlier is that of the transient. The two find the casket empty, but Doggett notices that the transient dug himself out of his own coffin. The sheriff arrives with the creature‚Äîrevealed to be a soul eater, which subsists off human disease‚Äîat the Hangemuhl home, where the symbol in blood is on the door again. The hideous creature opens its jaws wide and bites Marie. Doggett suggests to Skinner that Mulder shot someone to protect her from the man who was supposed to be in that grave. Meanwhile, deep underground, the creature vomits what appears to be the visceral remains of Marie into a person-shaped mold in the soil. Doggett goes off alone to see the woman who guarded the creature in the woods. The woman implies that Mulder, feeling sorry for the creature, was trying to euthanize it, not save Marie. Doggett hears a noise and finds a trap door leading into the tunnels. Underground, he finds Marie and takes her to the hospital. He reports to Skinner that her kidneys have healed spontaneously. Doggett returns to the woman who watches over the creature; after recoiling at its ugliness, the woman explains that it looks the way it does because it takes the sickness of others into itself, while healing them in the process. Doggett decides to take the creature away from society, which only uses it. However, Doggett is shot and killed in a scuffle with the sheriff and is promptly buried. Later, Doggett awakens in the tunnels. In the dark corner of the cavern, the woman weeps beside the dead soul eater. She reveals that, by eating Doggett's death, it has finally been allowed to die. Back at FBI Headquarters, Doggett is struggling to write his report. When Skinner checks in on him, he encourages Doggett to not submit a report, as it would contradict Mulder's earlier report and damage his, Scully's, and Doggett's own reputation. Doggett protests that Scully had no knowledge of the events, but Skinner reminds him that it would take months to clear her name, and that it is enough that the two of them know the truth about what happened. ProductionBackground and writing= right \\"The Gift\\" featured the first substantial appearance from Duchovny as Mulder since the season openers \\"Within\\" and \\"Without\\". After settling his contract dispute with Fox, Duchovny quit full-time participation in the show after the seventh season. In order to explain Mulder's absence, Duchovny's character was abducted by aliens in the seventh-season finale, \\"Requiem\\". After several rounds of contractual discussions, Duchovny agreed to return for a total of 11 season eight episodes. Series creator Chris Carter later argued that Mulder's absences from the series did not affect the series, noting that \\"there are characters who can be powerful as absent centers, as Mulder was through the eighth and ninth seasons.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles (2008), p. 189. The episode was written by executive producer Frank Spotnitz and was intended as a morality tale. Spotnitz made sure that the episode had an explicit purpose and reason, and he noted, \\"If you're going to depart from literal reality as most of us know‚Äîif you're going to go into supernatural‚Äîas a writer you have to ask yourself 'Why? ... And if you don't really have a point or reason, your story's probably not going to be very good.\\" Despite largely being concerned with a \\"Monster-of-the-Week\\", \\"The Gift\\" also fits in the series' overarching mythology. The Complete X-Files book, released in 2008, considers the episode part of the overall myth arc, however, it was not included on the 2005 DVD release The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 ‚Äì Super Soldiers.Hurwitz and Knowles (2008), p. 239. The episode touches upon and explores Mulder's brain disease, a plot device that was introduced in the season opener \\"Within\\". This was largely a retcon placed in the series after the fact. The series rationalized this revelation with the fact that, due to Mulder's exposure to the black oil in the fourth season episodes \\"Tunguska\\" and \\"Terma\\" and his forced brain operation by The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) in the seventh-season episode \\"The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati\\", his brain developed an incurable disease that was slowly killing him.Meisler (1998), pp. 95‚Äì101.Edwards (1996), pp. 200‚Äì01.Shapiro (2000), pp. 19‚Äì28. In fact, Mulder's \\"one-week recovery\\" from his brain surgery was a point of criticism when \\"The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati\\" initially aired in 1999. =Filming= \\"The Gift\\" was directed by Kim Manners, and it marked his third directing credit for the season, after the opening two-parter \\"Within\\" and \\"Without\\". Due to Duchovny's limited availability, Mulder's appearances were limited to flashbacks. This technique had previously been used during the filming of the episode \\"Per Manum\\", which‚Äîalthough it was aired after \\"The Gift\\"‚Äîwas filmed before this episode. The majority of the episode‚Äîlike the rest of seasons six, seven, eight and nine‚Äîwas filmed in and around the Los Angeles, California, area.Fraga (2010). The scenes taking place at the soul eater's residence were filmed on Ventura Farms, a California horse establishment and filming location near the town of Thousand Oaks.Fraga (2010), p. 198. The filming location had previously been used for the earlier eight season episode \\"Patience\\", for scenes taking place at the undertaker's residence.Fraga (2010), p. 185. The short scene featuring The Lone Gunmen was filmed on the set of their spin-off series, the eponymous The Lone Gunmen. Although the bulk of the episode was filmed by director Manners, the snippet of the Gunmen was directed by Bryan Spicer, who directed several of The Lone Gunmen episodes, as well as the Gunmen-centric sixth season entry \\"Three of a Kind\\". The episode was written to not require Gillian Anderson at all. As a result, the finished episode only features stock footage of Scully from \\"Within\\", and Anderson was not required to film any new scenes. Anderson later revealed that she was extremely grateful for this and other \\"Doggett-centric\\" episodes, because they provided her time to spend time with her daughter, Piper Maru, who was attending school in Canada. Anderson insisted that the show both understand her situation and make accommodations: in an interview, she explained, \\"I was determined that they respect that I would work for three weeks and then have two or three weeks off to go and be with her. So they agreed to that, and that was important to me. I'd never had that before on the show.\\" \\"The Gift\\" was the first episode that make-up artist Matthew W. Mungle's company worked on for The X-Files. The soul eater was a combination of actor Jordan Marder in make-up, and a silicone dummy that had an extendable mouth and movable teeth. Themes As The X-Files entered into its eighth season, \\"human resurrection and salvation\\" as well as \\"disease, suffering, and healing\\" became an increasingly central focus of the show. \\"The Gift\\", along with various other episodes during the eighth season of the show, would be the first to explore themes of death and resurrection. These sub- themes emerged in the season premiere \\"Within\\" when Scully is shown Mulder's tombstone. In \\"The Gift\\", the theme is explored further; not only is Doggett mortally wounded and then resurrected, the story behind Mulder's inoperable brain tumor is also explored. In \\"Deadalive\\", the theme reappears in full- force: Billy Miles is found dead but resurrects. Likewise, Mulder is buried for three months but returns to life. This sub-theme would continue well into the ninth season, in entries such as \\"Audrey Pauley\\".Kellner (2003), p. 155. The episode makes heavy use of a medicine wheel. Doggett first discovers this symbol on the unknown grave that he digs up. The wheel is a Native American symbol common in folklore that is considered sacred; although the size and shape varies, it usually consists of a central stone (or a cairn), surrounded by an outer ring (or rings) of stones, with at least two lines of rocks radiating from the center. The stone usage has been \\"mired in controversy\\", but most Native American scholars agree that it represents the \\"synthesis and wholeness, including concepts of renewal and rebirth\\". In the episode, the symbol takes the form of an \\"X\\"making it \\"identical to The X-Files program symbol\\".McIlwain (2005), p. 147. Amy Donaldson, in her book We Want to Believe contrasted the soul eater from \\"The Gift\\" to Leonard Betts, a \\"Monster-of-the- Week\\" character from the fourth season episode of the same name. In the episode, Mulder and Scully investigate the supposed death and regeneration of an emergency medical technician (EMT) named Leonard Betts, a mutant who subsists on and can detect cancer in others, as well as regenerate severed body parts.Meisler (1998), pp. 144‚Äì50. Donaldson reasons that Betts' condition, in which he is \\"riddled with cancer\\" but can \\"see the sickness within people\\", is a metaphor for someone who \\"has let sin or evil become the regular course of life\\".Donaldson (2011), p. 215. Although Betts can detect and consume the illness, his motives are derived from \\"his own self appetite\\". Donaldson argues that the soul eater is the polar opposite of Betts because it takes an illness in order to help a person, even though it hurts itself in the process. In other words, the soul eater is altruistic, whereas Betts is selfish.Donaldson (2011), p. 214. ReceptionRatings= Fox heavily promoted the episode due to the return of David Duchovny as Fox Mulder.175pxthumbright \\"The Gift\\" first premiered on Fox in the United States on February 4, 2001. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.8, meaning that it was seen by 8.8% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was viewed by 8.87 million households and 14.6 million viewers overall. The episode ranked as the 35th most-watched episode for the week ending February 4. The episode subsequently debuted in the United Kingdom on the BBC Two on May 19, 2002. Furthermore, because this was Duchovny's first episode since the season opener, Fox heavily promoted the promo spots on television; in the clip the announcer noted that \\"David Duchovny returns to The X-Files\\" in the episode. In part, the episode was heavily promoted because it occurred during the February Sweeps, a time in which Nielsen processes approximately 2 million paper diaries from households across the country to collect viewing information. On November 4, 2003, the episode was released as part of the eighth season DVD box set. =Reviews= Critical reception to the episode was largely mixed. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an \\"A\\" and called it \\"a great monster story, and my favorite of what I've seen of [season eight] so far.\\" He argued that the episode was \\"so effective\\" because it \\"isn't just the inversion of the monster/normal personal dichotomy; the show has pulled that trick before, and while it tries to play coy about the true nature of the soul eater at first, it's not hard to recognize who the real villain is.\\" Handlen also wrote that the episode both \\"forces the audience to identify more strongly with Doggett\\" and made good use of Anderson's absence. Meghan Deans of Tor.com felt that, while \\"the tale of the soul eater may have been a little rushed and a little sloppy\\", the episode itself \\"has a spark to it [which is the] spark of the absent, the drive of the missing. The feeling that we‚Äôre all here for a reason, and that the show wants to live.\\" Television Without Pity writer Jessica Morgan rated the episode a \\"B+\\" and applauded the return of Duchovny, writing, \\"welcome back, [...] you magnificent bastard.\\" Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations wrote a mixed review of the episode. On one hand, he praised the feel of the episode, writing, \\"in many ways, this was an episode that brought back the intensity, magic, and the power of The X-Files that I have been missing throughout this most mundane of seasons.\\"Kessenich (2002), p. 153. In this manner, Kessenich felt that Doggett became \\"part of The X-Files for the first time.\\" However, Kessenich also felt that the plot involving Mulder's terminal brain disease was a mis-step, noting that Mulder would have never kept something so serious and personal from Scully. He wrote, \\"a year ago, Mulder was not dying [but] what we once knew as truth has suddenly been replaced with a lie.\\"Kessenich (2002), p. 154. George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of the Contra Costa Times called the entry \\"one of the season's more engaging episodes\\" and wrote positively of the \\"intriguing possibilities\\" that it set up for the final part of the season. They were also positive about the manner in which Doggett and Mulder were able to connect in \\"some mystical way\\". However, Avalos and Liedtke were critical of the episode's placement, noting that it would have worked better had it been the \\"fourth or fifth episode of the season\\", as opposed to the eighth. Furthermore, they negatively wrote about the revelation that Mulder was suffering from a terminal brain disease, calling it a \\"monumental story\\" curve that did not bother \\"to connect all the dots behind\\" it. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode two stars out of five. Despite calling the episode \\"different\\", the two wrote that the story involving Mulder was \\"not very satisfying\\". In addition, the two called the finale \\"problematic\\" because it featured Skinner and Doggett suppressing the truth, a thematic choice that goes against the spirit of the series.Shearman and Pearson (2009), p. 238. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris criticized Doggett's role, noting that \\"you would think after this even he would become a raging believer, but no, he's not changed one bit.\\" Marisa Guthrie of the Boston Herald derided the fact that Duchovny was given such little amounts of screen time. Furthermore, she was critical that Doggett remained a skeptic at the end of the episode.

The episode first premiered on Fox in the United States on May 20, 2001, and subsequently aired in the United Kingdom on June 28, 2001, on Sky1. It was written by executive producer Chris Carter and directed by Kim Manners. \\"Existence\\" earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.4 and was watched by 8.58 million households and 14 million viewers, overall. The episode received largely positive reviews from television critics. The show centers on FBI special agents John Doggett (Robert Patrick) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson)‚Äîas well as ex-FBI agent Fox Mulder (David Duchovny)‚Äîwho work on cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. In this episode, continuing from the previous episode, \\"Essence\\", a new type of alien, called a Super Soldier programmed to destroy any traces of alien involvement on Earth, is introduced. Mulder, Doggett, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), and Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) help Scully escape from Billy Miles with Special Agent Monica Reyes (Annabeth Gish) to a remote town. Shortly after, Skinner kills Krycek and Scully delivers an apparently normal baby with the alien Super Soldiers surrounding her. Without explanation, the aliens leave the area as Mulder arrives. \\"Existence\\" is a story milestone for the series. It, along with previous season eight episodes starting with \\"Per Manum\\", helped to introduce the story arc featuring the super-soldiers which continued throughout the ninth season. The episode was the last to feature Fox Mulder's character until the series finale the following year. As such, the last scene with Doggett and Reyes in Kersh's office was intended to show the \\"New X-Files\\" without David Duchovny.  Plot  A metal box containing the remains of Billy Miles is brought to a coroner. The coroner examines it and notices what appears to be a metal vertebra. After he leaves the room, the metal vertebra begins to spin, growing into what looks like the beginnings of a metallic spine. Meanwhile, Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Monica Reyes arrive at the abandoned town where Special Agent John Doggett (Robert Patrick) was born. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) is seated in a chair in Assistant Director Walter Skinner's office, where he is shown a video from the morgue. Skinner tells him that Miles is somehow alive and still out to get Scully and her unborn child. Suddenly, Agent Gene Crane comes to Doggett and tells him that there is a person‚ÄîKnowle Rohrer‚Äîwho wants to see him about issues concerning Miles and Scully. This leaves Fox Mulder and Skinner to interrogate Krycek. Rohrer fabricates a story to Doggett that Miles is part of a secret military project to create \\"super soldiers\\" and that Scully had a chip put in the back of her neck during her abduction to make her pregnant with the first organic version of a super soldier. In Skinner's office, Krycek tries to leave. Skinner goes after him, then turns around and sees Miles approaching behind him. Skinner just manages to escape with Krycek, but Miles' hand breaks through the elevator door, injuring Skinner and knocking him unconscious. At the hospital, Mulder distrusts what Doggett has been told by Knowle Rohrer, so the two set out to find out how trustworthy he really is. Meanwhile, as Reyes and Scully are hiding out, Reyes sees someone running off and follows them. A car pulls up and she meets a trooper who agrees to help with the birth. As Mulder and Doggett pull into the garage, they find Krycek pulling up in another car, with a passenger who happens to be Rohrer. Mulder believes that Rohrer and Krycek are colluding together but doesn't understand why. Doggett covertly pursues Rohrer and learns that he has an accomplice: Agent Crane. Mulder's own problems arise when his cell phone rings and Krycek disappears from his car. Mulder, after learning what Doggett has witnessed, believes that Crane gave Krycek access to the FBI. Suddenly, Krycek smashes through the car window with his prosthetic hand and crushes Mulder's phone. Krycek threatens Mulder with a gun, but a bullet administered by Skinner pierces his arm. Krycek tries to pick his gun up again, but Skinner shoots his hand, rendering it useless. Krycek pushes his gun over and tells Skinner to shoot Mulder, claiming Mulder's life will grant him a thousand lives. Instead, Skinner shoots Krycek in the head. Doggett attempts to apprehend Rohrer and Crane but ends up being chased by the two. The pursuit ends violently with Crane being run over and Rohrer crashing his car into the garage wall, going up in flames. Both men are presumed dead. Scully goes into labour and Reyes helps her deliver an apparently normal baby, with alien Super Soldiers surrounding them and witnessing the birth in a cold stare. Without explanation, the aliens leave the area as Mulder arrives. While Doggett and Reyes report to FBI Headquarters, Doggett initiates an investigation into Deputy Director Alvin Kersh after previously witnessing a late night meeting between him, Rohrer and Crane (and their consequent disappearance). Mulder takes Scully and their baby back to her apartment. After marveling over the baby and discussing recent events, the two share a long, passionate kiss.  Production  Jesus Christ. =Writing and casting= \\"Existence\\" was written during filming, which led to Kim Manners‚Äîthe director of the episode‚Äîhelping with the script. Because of this, several of the action scenes, such as the fight at the FBI headquarters, were Manners' ideas. According to Manners, the last scene with Doggett and Reyes in Kersh's office was the \\"birth\\" of the \\"New X-Files\\" without David Duchovny as a lead. From here on, Monica Reyes became a main character on the show. Star Trek: The Next Generation regular Denise Crosby briefly appears as Scully's gynecologist. The episode features the last appearance of Nicholas Lea, sans the series finale. Reportedly, Lea had become tired of the role and was growing weary of the ambiguous nature of the character. When Lea learned that his character was to be killed off in \\"Existence\\", he reportedly welcomed the news. The night the episode aired, Lea wrote on his personal website: \\"I felt that [Krycek] wasn't getting a fair shake anyway. [...] I wanted more in-depth ideas about the character and it never came to pass. It kind of stopped being fun to play.\\"Kessenich, p. 146. The final scene of the episode featuring Mulder and Scully kissing almost was not filmed. Initially, the script called for Mulder to kiss Scully's forehead. Both Duchovny and Manners argued that the scene was \\"mundane\\" and that they had \\"been teasing and doing that bull for so long\\" that they wanted \\"a real kiss at this point\\". During the birth of Scully's child, several allusions to the story of the birth of Jesus are made, including Mulder following a star to find Scully and The Lone Gunmen bringing gifts for the baby, much like the Three Wise Men. Scully's child was portrayed by Jerry Shiban, who is the son of John Shiban, a producer who worked on The X-Files as well as The Lone Gunmen. He was the first of seven babies to represent the character and the only one to play Baby William for a single episode. =Effects and filming= Chris Carter included a scene with whale calls after listening to a Paul Winter album. The episode featured several elaborate CGI scenes. The first scene with the vertebrae was entirely computer generated by visual effects head John Wash. According to director Kim Manners, the most difficult scene to shoot was in the elevator with Mitch Pileggi and Nicholas Lea. Conversely, Manners favorite scene was the one in which Skinner kills Krycek. Manners himself proposed the uniqueness of the shot, which features a CGI bullet going straight through Krycek's head. Extra money was budgeted for Krycek's death. Mitch Pileggi was very happy when he was told he would be killing Krycek; he explained, \\"when they came to me and told me that I was the one that was going to kill Krycek, I was elated. Not because I wanted Nick to go away or anything, it was just from a character stand-point; Skinner just wanted to kill Krycek so bad.\\"Hurwitz and Knowles, p. 197. Manners later called it one of his \\"favorite scenes [he'd] ever directed\\" and one of the \\"best scenes [he's] seen in a long time on television.\\" The car scene with Gillian Anderson and Annabeth Gish was shot at Kanan Road, Malibu. Anderson and Gish sat in what is known as an insert car, while the crew sat in a pickup car in front of them. The birth scene was filmed at Paramount Ranch. Gish had never filmed with guns before joining The X-Files, so the producers hired a retired LAPD officer to teach her more about firearms. She also did some shooting practices before returning to the set. The FBI garage scenes were shot in Century City and took a total of four days to finish. The episode also contains a scene wherein Reyes serenades Scully with \\"karaoke renditions\\" of whale calls. Gish later noted that \\"[Series creator Chris Carter] gave me a tape of whale songs, which was hysterical to be playing in my trailer.\\" Carter was inspired to write the scene after a friend gave him a Paul Winter album that incorporated whale sounds into the music. Carter later explained that, \\"I just thought it was kind of much like [Reyes'] character to appreciate that.\\" ReceptionRatings= \\"Existence\\" premiered on May 20, 2001, in the United States on Fox. The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 8.4, meaning that it was seen by 8.4% of the nation's estimated households. The episode was watched by 8.58 million households and by 14 million viewers, overall. In the United Kingdom, \\"Existence\\" premiered on June 28, 2001, and received 0.65 million viewers, placing The X-Files number three in the top ten broadcasts for Sky1 that week behind Star Trek: Voyager and The Simpsons. Note: Information is in the section titled \\"w/e June 25 ‚Äì July 1, 2001\\", listed under Sky 1 Fox promoted the episode with the tagline \\"Will the beginning be the end?\\" The episode was later included on The X-Files Mythology, Volume 4 ‚Äì Super Soldiers, a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien super soldiers arc. =Reviews= \\"Existence\\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a \\"B\\". While offering a positive opinion in regards to the finale as a whole, he felt that \\"Existence\\" dragged more so than \\"Essence\\", resulting in a less interesting episode. He also felt that the overarching mythology of the series had long ago become too convoluted to make sense, but that the \\"human pieces of the show still work, and that includes Doggett.\\" Contra Costa Times columnists George Avalos and Michael Liedtke were pleased with the episode noting that the last scene was \\"beautifully written\\". Avalos and Liedtke also reacted positively to the death of Alex Krycek at the hands of Skinner, saying it was the best scene in the episode. Despite their praise, however, they stressed that \\"Existence\\" was not as exciting as the previous episode, \\"Essence,\\" or the 1998 The X-Files feature film. Jessica Morgan of Television Without Pity gave the episode an A- rating, noting that \\"season eight's finale goes out with a big fat juicy kiss between Mulder and Scully, at long last\\". Gareth Wigmore of TV Zone was positive toward both \\"Essence\\" and \\"Existence\\". Wigmore gave the episodes a 9 out of 10 rating and wrote \\"the reason that this two- parter works is that its plot is simple enough for the audience to still have a handle on\\". Not all reviews were positive. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a more mixed two-and-a-half stars out of five.Shearman and Pearson, pp. 247‚Äì48. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a scathing review and awarded it no stars out of four. She heavily derided the plot, and wrote, \\"Thus endeth the Mulder-and-Scully era of The X-Files, and what a load of sanctimonious crap it turned out to be!\\"  Notes FootnotesBibliography  External links * * \\"Existence\\" at TV.com Category:2001 American television episodes Category:Television episodes set in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:The X-Files (season 8) episodes Category:Television episodes set in Washington, D.C.

Early life and education  Thomas Lamb Eliot was born in St. Louis, Missouri, as the first son of Rev. William Greenleaf Eliot, D.D., of the Church of the Messiah in St. Louis. An injury to his eyes interrupted his education at Washington University in St. Louis, which his father helped start and run. Hoping to improve his eyes, he sailed around Cape Horn to California in 1860 where Thomas Starr King said to him, \\"The Pacific Coast claims everyone who has ever seen it‚Äîthere‚Äôs Oregon!\\" His sight was not remedied by the trip, and upon his return, for several months of Divinity school he had to have his books read aloud to him. Eliot was in the first class to graduate from Washington University in 1862. Eliot enlisted in the Union Army, but never engaged in battle. He fired his musket once under orders to shoot a deserter, but he missed. After graduation he enlisted in the Home Guard of Missouri, but served only within the state. For two years he ran a mission house for the poor of St. Louis connected to his father's church while studying with his father for the ministry. He married Henrietta Robins Mack of St. Louis on November 28, 1865. He graduated from Harvard Divinity School in 1865, doing two years of study in one, despite eyesight so poor his books were often read to him. In 1866 he earned a Master of Arts from Washington University.  Ministry  Eliot ministered in Louisville, Kentucky and, for several weeks at a spell, assisted the Church of the Messiah in New Orleans. Eliot was recruited in 1867 by churches in Portland, Maine; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Portland, Oregon. He accepted the offer from Oregon, from the newly built First Unitarian Church, having wanted to relocate to the Pacific Northwest since his first trip to the west coast. He moved to Portland with Henrietta and their infant son, traveling through New York and Panama. By 1869 when Dorothea Dix visited Portland, Eliot also began holding one outreach service per month at institutions in town including the Insane Asylum of East Portland, the County Jail, and the County Farm. He also occasionally hosted services at the Oro Fino saloon. E. Kimbark MacColl stated \\"Within a decade of his arrival in Portland... he became the city's most influential religious figure.\\" Eliot was the only minister to greet women's rights advocate Abigail Scott Duniway to Portland.  Civic legacy  One historian noted Eliot's pervasive role in the civic and cultural life of the city, observing that he \\"played a central role in creating and shaping the educational, cultural, and civic landscape of Portland. He had a hand in steering virtually every major public institution in the city, crowning his career with an achievement that would have made his father proud: the founding of Reed College.\\" Another wrote that Eliot \\"founded the First Unitarian Church, the Oregon Humane Society, and the Boys & Girls Aid Society; worked to improve conditions in the county jail; ministered to orphans, the poor, and the mentally ill; championed public schools, the public library, and women's right to vote.\\" He was a board member of the \\"Portland Art Association and the Library Association of Portland, steering those organizations toward the founding of the Portland Art Museum and the Portland Public Library (now the Multnomah County Library).\\" Upon Reed College's opening in 1911, Eliot was named chair of the board of trustees, serving there until 1924. In 1935, the arts and sciences building on campus was named for Eliot to \\"honor his dedication and service to the college.\\" See also * Eliot, Portland, Oregon * Eliot Glacier * Eliot Hall  References  Category:Oregon Country Category:1841 births Category:1936 deaths Category:Oregon pioneers Category:American Unitarians Category:Oregon clergy Category:Eliot family (America) Category:Washington University in St. Louis alumni Category:Harvard Divinity School alumni ","title":"Thomas Lamb Eliot"},{"id":"21777205","text":"The Funeral Rule, enacted by the Federal Trade Commission on April 30, 1984 and amended it effective 1994, was designed to protect consumers by requiring that they receive adequate information concerning the goods and services they may purchase from a funeral provider.

Overview The Funeral Rule defines and provides parameters in the following key subject areas: * Definition of a General Price List, or GPL * Specific disclosures must be provided in writing to the consumer regarding embalming, alternative containers for direct cremation, the basic service fee, the Casket Price List and the Outer Burial Container Price List * Specific misrepresentations in six areas: embalming, casket for direct cremation, outer burial container, legal and cemetery requirements, preservative and protective vault claims, cash advance items and other misrepresentations \\\\- The GPL must contain a written acknowledgement that consumers have the right to choose the funeral goods and services desired, with some exceptions * Disclosure and reference to any state or local laws that require a consumer to purchase any particular item * A funeral home may not refuse or charge a fee to handle a casket that is purchased from a third-party provider * A funeral home that also offers cremation must offer an inexpensive, unfinished wood box or alternative container with a non-metal enclosure that is cremated with the body * Written disclosure must be made of the consumer's right to purchase an unfinished wood box or alternative container for direct cremation * A funeral home may not claim that state or local law require a casket for direct cremation * A written description and price list of all caskets must be provided before viewing any caskets for sale * A written acknowledgement provided to the consumer stating that consumers do not have to purchase a package funeral arrangement * Written details, including associated expenses, regarding viewing or visitation of the deceased * Written details, including associated expenses, of a formal funeral service * Written details, including associated expenses, regarding transportation to the cemetery * A funeral home must provide a written GPL to all persons who inquire in person about funeral arrangements, regardless of whether they are a consumer looking to purchase funeral goods and services from the funeral home now or in the future * The GPL must be provided for the inquiring individual or group to keep * The GPL must be offered when any discussion begins regarding funeral arrangements, goods or services or the prices of such, regardless of the location of the discussion * The GPL does not have to be physically mailed in response to telephone or mail inquiries, although accurate information must be provided to a telephone inquiry * A fee cannot be charged for providing a GPL in response to a telephone or mail inquiry Types of funerals The Funeral Rule defines clearly several funeral types to minimize the chance of miscommunication or misunderstanding between the funeral service provider and customer. ;\\"Traditional\\", full-service funeral: The Funeral Rule describes a traditional, full-service funeral as including a viewing or visitation of the deceased, usually held in the funeral home, a formal funeral service, transportation of the deceased to the cemetery (hearse), the burial, entombment or cremation in addition to the funeral director's basic service fee. Extra costs not included in the aforementioned arrangements include embalming and the dressing of the body, the funeral home's basic service fee, funeral home rental for the viewing or service, use of vehicles (limousine) to transport the family or pallbearers, the casket or urn, the cemetery plot or crypt, flowers, obituary notice, and others. ;Immediate burial: The Funeral Rule describes immediate burial as a burial that occurs shortly after death with no viewing or visitation and is usually in a simple container or casket. There is generally no viewing or visitation, so embalming is not necessary or required. A memorial service is generally held at the burial site, or at a later date. Costs associated with this choice include the funeral director's basic service fee, transportation and care of the body, the casket or burial container and the cemetery plot or crypt. If the family selects a burial site service, extra charges will be added. ;Direct cremation: The Funeral Rule described direct cremation as cremation that occurs shortly after death with no viewing or visitation and embalming is not necessary or required. A memorial may be held with or without the remains. The remains may be kept in the home, buried, placed in a crypt or niche or scattered in a favorite spot. Costs associated with direct cremation include the funeral director's basic service fee, transportation and care of the body, a crematory fee may be included if the funeral home provides crematory services, the cost of an urn or other container and the cemetery plot or crypt if the remains are buried or entombed. If the funeral home does not provide crematory services, a third- party crematory service fee will also be added on. The Funeral Rule establishes that all funeral homes that offer cremation must offer consumers containers other than caskets. Viewing or visitation U.S. persons, under The Funeral Rule, are not required to use a funeral home to conduct the viewing or visitation or funeral, however, there are many details and legal requirements, so it is a commonly accepted practice to use one. Funeral transfer service providers remedy the need for a funeral home while at the same time removing the obstacles that inhibit a lay person from performing the basic requirements of transportation, storage and documents preparation. Basic service fee The Funeral Rule allows for funeral homes to charge a basic service fee. Consumers who select to work with a particular funeral home cannot decline to pay this fee, which includes fees for services common to all funerals, such as: \\\\- Planning and arranging the actual funeral, such as determining the viewing or visitation dates and times \\\\- Securing the applicable permits and copies of the death certificate \\\\- Preparation of obituary notices. If an extra service charge is applied, this must be disclosed in writing \\\\- Sheltering of the remains \\\\- Coordinating arrangements with the cemetery, crematory or other third-party \\\\- The basic service fee does not include optional services or goods Optional goods or services The Funeral Rule defines optional goods or services as everything outside of what is specifically delineated as being included in the basic service fee, including cash advance items. Some examples of optional goods or services include: \\\\- Transportation of the remains \\\\- embalming or other preparation \\\\- Use of the funeral home and staff for viewing or visitation \\\\- The funeral or memorial ceremony \\\\- Use of the hearse for transportation to the cemetery \\\\- Limousine for family or pallbearers \\\\- casket or urn \\\\- Outer burial container, if required by the cemetery Alternate burial container \\\\- cremation or inurnment A cash advance is used for any goods or services that the funeral home purchases from a third-party vendor on behalf of their customer. Some examples of cash advance items include: \\\\- Flowers \\\\- obituary notice \\\\- Pallbearers \\\\- Officiating clergy \\\\- Organist or soloist The Funeral Rule stresses the importance of the consumer to clarify with the funeral home whether there is a premium charged for cash advance items. Some funeral homes pass through the exact expense to their customers, while others apply a mark- up, which is allowable under The Funeral Rule. According to The Funeral Rule, funeral homes that charge a mark-up must disclose this in writing to their customers, but the amount or percentage of the mark-up need not be disclosed. The Funeral Rule also establishes that funeral homes must disclose whether any refunds, rebates or discounts apply to any cash advance item. Itemized statement The Funeral Rule directs that the funeral home must provide the customer with a written itemized statement, including the total cost. However, The Funeral Rule does not establish format guidelines for the itemized statement and it may be included on any document given to the customer at the end of the discussion about funeral arrangements. The Funeral Rule stresses the importance of understanding what goods and services are included in the basis service fee and what is being itemized as optional and charged for separately. The itemized statement must include the charges for cash advance goods and services. If the funeral home is unsure of the exact amount of cash advance items, a written ‚Äúgood faith estimate‚Äù must be provided in writing. The itemized statement must also disclose any legal, crematory or cemetery requirements on any goods or service purchased. Embalming Many funeral homes require embalming if a viewing or visitation is planned, however, there is no federal or state law that dictates that embalming is required and a funeral home is prohibited from stating that any such law exists. The Funeral Rule established the following embalming guidelines: \\\\- Embalming cannot be done without specific permission from the customer \\\\- Funeral homes may not claim that embalming is a legal requirement, except in certain special circumstances, and provide written disclosure of such \\\\- Customers may not be charged for embalming without their permission unless it was required by state law in certain special circumstances \\\\- The customer must receive written disclosure stating that individuals usually have the right to choose a disposition that does not require embalming, such as direct cremation or immediate burial, which do not require embalming \\\\- Written disclosure must be made if a funeral arrangement, such a viewing or visitation, may require embalming as a practical necessity and therefore, a required purchase Caskets Caskets are typically metal, wood, fiberglass, fiberboard or plastic. The Funeral Rule states that customers must be provided a written description of each casket offered and the associated Casket Price List before viewing of any physical caskets. The Funeral Rule also mandates that a funeral home must accept any third-party purchased casket for the funeral and may not charge any fees for acceptance. Some caskets include features such as ‚Äúgasketed‚Äù, ‚Äúprotective‚Äù or includes a ‚Äúsealer‚Äù. These terms generally mean the casket has a rubber gasket or other feature designed to delay water seepage and prevent rust. According to The Funeral Rule, these features may delay the decomposition of the remains, but they will not prevent it forever. Some caskets come with warranties, but the warranty is for the durability of the casket, not for protection from eventual decomposition of the remains. Under The Funeral Rule, no person selling any casket may claim that caskets with these features will prevent decomposition of the remains forever, because that is not possible. Cremation According to The Funeral Rule, funeral homes and any crematory must comply with the following: \\\\- An inexpensive, unfinished wood or alternative container, with a non-metal enclosure that is cremated with the body must be made available. These are generally made of press board, cardboard or canvas. \\\\- It may not be stated that state or local laws require the purchase of a casket for direct cremation \\\\- Written disclosure must be provided to the customer's on their right to buy an unfinished wood box or alternative container for direct cremation \\\\- An unfinished wood box or alternative container must be made available If a viewing or visitation is requested prior to cremation, many funeral homes have caskets for rent in lieu of purchasing a casket. Outer burial container Outer burial containers are not required by law but are required by many cemeteries. The outer burial container surrounds the casket in the grave to protect it from sinking into the ground. There are two types of outer burial containers, a grave liner and a burial vault. A grave liner is generally made from reinforced concrete that satisfies any cemetery requirement and covers the top and sides of the casket. A burial vault is more substantial and expensive and surrounds the entire casket in concrete or other material. The Funeral Rule dictates that the customer must be given a written description and Outer Burial Container Price List prior to viewing any physical items and that the funeral home cannot claim either in writing or verbally that any process or product will preserve the remains indefinitely. Cemetery sites When selecting a cemetery site, The Funeral Rule advises consumers to considering the following: \\\\- Location of the cemetery and burial plot \\\\- Religious requirements or affiliations \\\\- Restrictions or charges associated with the outer burial container if purchased from a third-party \\\\- Types of grave markers or monuments allowed by the cemetery \\\\- Whether flowers or other remembrances may be placed on the grave \\\\- Burial plot price \\\\- Outer burial container requirements \\\\- Charges for opening the grave \\\\- Charges for closing the grave \\\\- Perpetual charges for maintenance and grounds keeping, which are sometimes included, but not always \\\\- If perpetual charges are not included, clarify the separate endowment care fee for maintenance and grounds keeping \\\\- If cremated remains are housed at a cemetery, clarify mausoleum or columbarium fees \\\\- Opening mausoleum or columbarium fees \\\\- Closing mausoleum or columbarium fees \\\\- Perpetual endowment charges for maintenance or other services of the mausoleum or columbarium The Funeral Rule does not apply to cemeteries and mausoleums unless they offer both funeral goods and services. U.S. veteran cemeteries In the U.S., all veterans are entitled to a free burial in a national cemetery and a grave marker. This benefit is also extended to some civilians who provided military related services and some Public Health service providers. Additionally, this benefit includes the veteran's spouse and dependent children who also may receive a free burial in a national cemetery and a grave marker. Cemeteries are prohibited from charging the family for opening or closing fees, charging for an outer burial container or the grave marker setting in a national cemetery, however, families are responsible for the remaining expenses. Many states have established state veteran cemeteries, but this varies state by state and the specific state should be contacted for more information. The Funeral Rule advises that consumers should be cautious when considering commercial cemeteries offering ‚Äúveterans specials‚Äù. The Funeral Rule advises that the savings offered are usually recaptured through charging inflated fees for an adjoining spouse plot and/or high opening and closing fees. Pre-need contracts With the exception of a cemetery plot if you are certain of where you want to be buried or entombed, the Federal Trade Commission does not advocate purchasing pre-need contracts. The Funeral Rule states that all guidelines and rules set forth must be complied with at the time pre-need funeral arrangements are discussed, at the time of contract purchase and at the time of the actual funeral. The Funeral Rule does not cover the language and parameters of the actual pre-need contract, nor does The Funeral Rule set forth guidelines on things such as payment options, costs or ability to modify, transfer or cancel the contract, or administrative fees. If the survivors of the deceased pre-need contract holder inquire about funeral goods or services, alter the pre-need funeral arrangements or are required to pay additional sums of money, all relevant price lists and disclosures must be provided in writing, either printed or typewritten, by the funeral home in a format for them to keep. The survivors must also be provided, in writing, an itemized statement and final cost. Individuals or organizations selling pre- need contracts on behalf of, or acting as an agent of, one or more funeral homes, but who themselves do not sell funeral goods or services, must comply with The Funeral Rule. The Funeral Rule does not apply to pre-need funeral arrangements or pre-need contracts purchased before The Funeral Rule went into effect in 1984. However, if a pre-need contract purchased before 1984 is modified after 1984, the modification triggers all of The Funeral Rule's requirements. Since the actual pre-need contract purchased is not subject to The Funeral Rule, the Federal Trade Commission advocates that consumers who purchase a pre-need contract consider the following: \\\\- Understand if funeral goods or services, or both, have been purchased. \\\\- Where are the pre-paid funds held? Rules governing the custody of pre-paid funds vary state by state. \\\\- Pre-paid funeral arrangements are not covered by federal law and state law varies state by state. \\\\- Who benefits from the interest income if the pre- paid funds earn interest? \\\\- What protections are in place for the consumer in the event that the funeral home holding the pre-need contract goes out of business or is purchased by a national funeral home chain or is merged into another funeral home. \\\\- The specific cancellation or revision policy, including the refund policy. \\\\- Transferability of the pre-need contract to another funeral home and the associated expenses. \\\\- Up-front and on-going administrative or other fees paid to the funeral home. A Pre-Need Funeral Contract is not, and should not be confused with a Pre-Need Funeral Plan, also known as a Funeral Plan. Specific prohibited misrepresentations The Funeral Rule prohibits specific misrepresentations in six areas. 1\\\\. Embalming The Funeral Rule prohibits funeral homes from telling consumers that state or local law requires embalming if that is not true. If state law does require embalming, the funeral home may tell the family that embalming is required to the specific circumstances. Funeral homes must disclose in writing on the GPL that embalming is not required by law except in special circumstances, and must include the following disclosure language: ‚ÄúExcept in certain special cases, embalming is not required by law. Embalming may be necessary, however, if you select certain funeral arrangements, such as a funeral with a viewing. If you do not want embalming, you usually have the right to choose an arrangement that does not require you to pay for it, such as direct cremation or immediate burial.‚Äù If state or local law does not require embalming under any circumstances, The Funeral Rule allows for the phrase ‚Äúexcept in certain special cases‚Äù to be omitted. This disclosure should be placed directly next to the price for embalming. If a family member wants to briefly view the deceased by lifting the lid of the casket prior to an immediate burial, The Funeral Rule prohibits the funeral home from charging the family for preparation of the body if embalming is declined. The request to see the deceased does not constitute a formal viewing or visitation. 2\\\\. Casket for Direct Cremation The Funeral Rule prohibits funeral homes from telling consumers that state or local law requires the purchase of a casket for direct cremation, or for any other reason. If direct cremation is offered, The Funeral Rule dictates that an alternative container be available and that consumers be informed that such alternative container is available. This must be disclosed in writing on the GPL with the following language: ‚ÄúIf you want to arrange a direct cremation, you can use an alternative container. Alternative containers encase the body and can be made of materials like fiberboard or composition materials (with or without an outside covering). The containers we provide are (specify containers)‚Äù. This disclosure should be placed directly next to the price range for direct cremation. If direct cremation is not offered, this disclosure may be omitted. 3\\\\. Outer Burial Container The Funeral Rule prohibits funeral homes from telling consumers that state or local law requires them to buy an outer burial container, if that is not true. Consumers must also be told that state law does not require them to purchase an outer burial container. Prices for outer burial containers may be included on the GPL or on a separate Outer Burial Container Price List. If included on the GPL, the following disclosure must be included and placed directly next t the outer burial container prices: ‚ÄúIn most areas of the country, state or local law does not require that you buy a container to surround the casket in the grave. However, many cemeteries require that you have such a container so that the grave will not sink in. Either a grave liner or a burial vault will satisfy these requirements‚Äù. If a separate Outer Burial Container Price List is used, the GPL must state the range of prices for the outer burial containers sold by the funeral home, along with the following disclosure: ‚ÄúA complete price list will be provided at the funeral home‚Äù. 4\\\\. Legal and Cemetery Requirements The Funeral Rule states that funeral homes cannot tell consumers that any federal, state, or local law or a particular cemetery or crematory requires them to buy a particular good or service, if that is not true. If a consumer is told that a particular good or service must be purchased because of any legal, cemetery or crematory requirement, the applicable requirement must be identified and described on the Statement of Funeral Goods and Services Selected. 5\\\\. Preservative and Protective Value Claims The Funeral Rule prohibits any representations to consumers that funeral goods or services will delay the natural decomposition of human remains for a long term or an indefinite time. The Funeral Rule prohibits representation that funeral goods such as caskets or outer burial containers have protective features or will protect the body from gravesite substances because that is not true. All warranty information must be provided to the family and it must be clarified by the funeral home that the claims made in the warranty are made by the manufacturer and not by the funeral home. 6\\\\. Cash Advance Items If a funeral home charges a mark-up on cash advance items or receives a commission, discount or rebate that is not passed along to the consumer, the funeral home is prohibited from stating that the price charged for the cash advance item is the same as the actual cost. If a funeral home charges a mark-up, or receives a rebate, commission, or trade or volume discount, it must be disclosed to the consumer in writing on the Statement of Funeral Goods and Services Selected, with each cash advance item listed separately, with the following disclosure: ‚ÄúWe charge you for our services in obtaining: (specify cash advance items)‚Äù. The Funeral Rule does not prevent the funeral home from charging a mark-up on cash advance items, nor does it require the funeral home to disclose the amount of the charge, rebate, commission or discount. Other misrepresentations Other kinds of misrepresentations, though not specifically prohibited by The Funeral Rule, are illegal. The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits deceptive acts or practices. Problem solving guidelines The Funeral Rule also provides a set of problem solving guidelines for consumers.

Forming out of a tropical disturbance on September 15, 2007, it quickly developed into a tropical storm, and intensified into a typhoon the following day with the appearance of an eye feature. After a period of rapid intensification, Wipha attained its peak intensity on September 18, with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph) and a barometric pressure of 925 mbar (hPa), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. Later that day, the storm began to weaken as it interacted with the mountainous terrain of Taiwan before brushing the northern edge of the island. Wipha subsequently made landfall near Fuding along the Fujian-Zhejiang provincial border with winds estimated at 185 km/h (115 mph) by the JTWC. Shortly thereafter, the typhoon weakened as it moved inland, weakening to a tropical storm within 18 hours of moving over land. Nearly 2 million residents along the Chinese coastline evacuated ahead of Typhoon Wipha's arrival. Nearly 20,000 Chinese soldiers were deployed to the area to assist residents in reinforcing flood barriers and speeding up evacuations. The typhoon triggered severe flooding with rainfall in excess of . Roughly 13,000 homes were destroyed, 57,000 more were damaged and 100,000 hectares of farmland was inundated. Throughout China, 14 people were killed and damage amounted to ¬•7.45 billion (US$1 billion). Although the center of the storm did not pass near the Philippines, its outer rainbands brought severe flooding to Negros Occidental. Two people died and three others were listed as missing. Damage amounted to PHP 15.3 million (US$314,000). In Taiwan, high winds killed one person and injured another. Up to of precipitation caused landslides and flooding across the island. Agricultural losses in Taiwan amounted to NT$7.8 million (US$236,300). In Okinawa, high winds and rainfall up to caused significant damage and resulted in two fatalities. Seven homes across the islands were destroyed and damage totaled ¬•28.3 billion (US$285 million). Meteorological history Typhoon Wipha originated from a tropical disturbance that was first identified by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) on September 13, 2007 roughly east of Guam. Deep convection had developed around an area of low pressure that formed within the disturbance. Low wind shear allowed the system to steadily develop as it moved northward. Late on September 14, convective banding features had formed around the center of circulation, prompting the JTWC to issue a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Several hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system as a tropical depression. At the same time, the JTWC declared that the disturbance had become Tropical Depression 13W. Shortly thereafter, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) also began issuing advisories on the developing depression, assigning it the local name Goring. Initially, a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough situated to the north of the depression suppressed convective development and outflow. However, late on September 15, this system weakened, leading to both the JTWC and JMA upgrading the depression to a tropical storm early on September 16. Upon being declared a tropical storm, the JMA assigned the name Wipha to the storm. Throughout September 16, Wipha underwent a brief period of rapid intensification, with the JTWC upgrading it to a Category 1 hurricane, on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson Hurricane Scale, within 12 hours. The intensifying system maintained a northwesterly track in response to a subtropical ridge over the northwest Pacific. Early on September 17, Wipha was upgraded to a typhoon as 10-minute sustained winds reached 120 km/h (75 mph). A second round of rapid intensification took place through most of the day, leading to the typhoon attaining its peak intensity late on September 17 with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph 10-minute sustained) and a barometric pressure of 925 mbar (hPa; 27.31 inHg). At the same time, the JTWC assessed Wipha to have nearly attained Category 5 status, peaking as a high-end Category 4 super typhoon with winds of 250 km/h (155 mph 1-minute sustained). Upon reaching this intensity, Wipha became the second strongest storm of the 2007 Pacific typhoon season. Not long after reaching its peak intensity, Wipha began to weaken as it started to interact with the high terrain of Taiwan. Early on September 18, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Typhoon Goring as it left their area of responsibility. Later that day, the center of the typhoon passed roughly 130 km/h (80 mi) north of Taipei, Taiwan. Continued weakening took place as the storm neared landfall in Mainland China. Around 1800 UTC, the eye of Wipha crossed the Chinese coastline near Wenzhou with sustained winds of 140 km/h (85 mph 10-minute sustained). The JTWC assessed Wipha to have made landfall as a low-end Category 3 typhoon with winds of 185 km/h (115 mph 1-minute sustained). Rapid weakening took place as the storm moved further inland. The JTWC issued their final advisory on Wipha during the afternoon of September 19 as they classified the system as an extratropical cyclone. However, the JMA continued to monitor the system as a tropical depression until September 20\\\\. At this time, the remnants of Wipha had entered the Yellow Sea and accelerated northeastward towards the Korean Peninsula. The extratropical remnants of Wipha persisted for several more hours before dissipating off the coast of North Korea that afternoon. PreparationsTaiwan= Infrared satellite image of Typhoon Wipha near Yaeyama Islands on September 17 The Songshan Airport in Taipei was shut down due to the threat of Typhoon Wipha. All businesses, including the stock exchange, were closed for September 18. Typhoon warnings were issued in northern areas of the island and residents were warned about the possibility of landslides in the mountainous regions. Accordingly, 169 people left landslide-prone areas. An additional 237 people were evacuated from the northern areas of Taiwan due to the storm. A code red alert was issued for the areas closest to the center of the cyclone. Nearly 4,300 Chinese fishermen sought refuge in Taiwan after being called back to port. =China= As Wipha approached the Chinese coastline, threatening the city of Shanghai, one of the largest evacuations in the country's history took place. Local media warned that Wipha \\"may be the most destructive typhoon in a decade.\\" More than 2 million people evacuated from coastal areas, 1.79 million of whom were in Zhejiang Province, the largest relocation of residents in the history of Zhejiang. Following the issuance of a Super Typhoon Warning, Shanghai officials evacuated 291,000 people from old buildings, temporary construction sites, and those who live near the coast. About 20,000 soldiers were sent to assist in the evacuation and reinforce flood barriers. A parade which was scheduled to take place in Shanghai was cancelled due to the warnings. About 365 workers were evacuated from the Pinghu oil rig located in the East China Sea. Zoos caged animals and increased staff numbers to prevent escape and contain any fires which may be sparked by downed power lines. More than 39,000 people were evacuated from Jiangsu Province, mainly along the coast. Numerous cities cancelled schools and closed business for the day of and following the typhoon. The typhoon also caused FIFA to reschedule four matches in the Women's World Cup. Nearly 40,000 vessels were recalled to port throughout China. About 250,000 people were also evacuated from Fujian Province with an additional 1.41 million text messages were also sent out to residents in the province. The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) commenced \\"level one\\" emergency plan, the highest state of emergency. The Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief commenced a \\"level two\\" flood control emergency plan and sent four teams to the provinces which were anticipated to be impacted by Wipha. About 50,000 factories in Zhejiang were shut down until Wipha passed. The large-scale evacuations resulted in a lower loss of life from the typhoon. =Japan and South Korea= In Okinawa, about 30,000 people were evacuated from low-lying areas near rivers which threatened to overflow their banks. At least 50 flights in and out of the prefecture were also cancelled or delayed. Already hit by Typhoon Nari just a few days prior to Wipha, South Korea began evacuating residents as the remnants of the typhoon were expected to hit the country. Rainfall was expected to impact South Korea for several days with accumulations exceeding 150 mm (6 in). About 940 people were evacuated to shelters throughout the country. Impact Nari from September 13‚Äì20 =Philippines= Although Wipha did not directly impact the Philippines, the outer bands of the storm produced severe flooding in Negros Occidental. The flooding washed out large areas of agricultural land worth PHP 10.3 million (US$211,000). Numerous farm to market roads were also damaged or destroyed, costing PHP 5 million (US$103,000). The floods also destroyed 13 homes and damaged 31 others. A rare tornado spawned by the storm destroyed four homes and damaged 19 others. A total of 7,640 families were affected by Wipha in the Philippines. The heavy rains caused a landslide which killed one person on September 16\\\\. Another man drowned in a flood swollen river on September 21. Three other people were listed as missing after being swept away in a river swollen by Wipha. =Taiwan= One person was killed and another was injured in Taipei after a 20 m (65 ft) high scaffolding in a construction site collapsed. At least 495 mm (19 in) of rain fell in the mountains of Taiwan, triggering flooding which damaged about 24 hectares of crops, leaving NT$7.8 million (US$236,300) in losses. A total of 8,795 residences were left without power at the height of the storm. Several roads and bridges were also washed out from flooding. Officials in Taiwan recorded 29 landslides, mostly in northern areas, and urged residents to evacuate due to the possibility of more. =China= Flooding in Shanghai, China The outer bands of Typhoon Wipha began impacting parts of eastern China on September 17\\\\. Heavy rains dropped up to 162 mm (6.3 in) in some cities, causing rivers to near flood stage. Eighty streets in Shanghai flooded due to the rains ahead of Wipha, with news reports showing waters rising up to people's knees. Upwards of 191 mm (7.5 in) of additional rain fell during the typhoon, causing significant flooding which destroyed at least 13,000 homes, damaged 57,000 others, and flooded over 160,000 hectares of farmland. At least 1,900 communities were left without power as high winds knocked down numerous power lines. A total of 14 people were killed in China in direct relation to Wipha. One man was electrocuted and died after stepping into floodwaters with live power lines submerged in the water. A landslide triggered by the heavy rains killed five people. At least 11 million people were affected by the storm in Fujian and Zhejiang. Once floodwaters receded, a car was found turned over, the five passengers inside were declared dead on scene. Damages in China amounted to ¬•7.45 billion ($1 billion USD). =Japan= As Wipha brushed Okinawa, it produced upwards of 335 mm (13.1 in) throughout the islands, peaking on Ishigaki. The highest winds were recorded on Ohara, Okinawa at 140 km/h (87 mph). Typhoon Wipha killed two people, one of which died during the evacuation from an illness, injured six others, and left another missing throughout the country. A total of seven homes were destroyed, four were damaged, and 39 others were affected. About 3,931 hectares of farmland, of roads, and three ports, along with ten ships, were damaged or destroyed. At the height of the storm, about 10,800 residences were without power. Damages from the storm amounted to ¬•28.3 billion ($285 million USD). =North Korea= The remnants of Wipha approaching the Korean peninsula on September 20 Heavy rainfall from the typhoon's remnants, ruined over 100,000 hectares of crops and either damaged or destroyed 14,000 homes. Additionally, over 8,000 public buildings were partially or fully demolished. A total of 1,649 people were left homeless following the storm. A month prior to Wipha, deadly flooding impacted most of the country, leaving at least 600 people dead or missing and destroyed thousands of structures. AftermathPhilippines and China= Following the flooding, the local governments in Valladolid and San Enrique declared a state of calamity to allow funds to reach flood victims. By September 26, about PHP 700,000 (US$14,000) worth of relief supplies had been distributed to the affected areas. At least PHP 480,000 (US$10,000) of the calamity funds were sent to the local governments in Negros Occidental. On September 20, the Chinese Government allocated ¬•81 million ($11.8 million USD) in living subsidies for those affected by the typhoon. The International Red Cross, which was already assisting China in recovery from flooding in August, took preparatory measures and worked with local branches to get damage assessments. The Zhejiang Red Cross branch provided ¬•200,000 (US$29,000) in relief items to the hardest hit areas. =North Korea= Following the impacts of Wipha to the already severely flooded areas of North Korea, the International Red Cross delivered relief supplies to the 2,000 people made homeless by the typhoon. Hundreds of medical clinics which were damaged or destroyed set up makeshift clinics as up to 70 percent of the affected population reported abdominal pains or diarrhea. More than 23,000 volunteers from the Red Cross mobilized to provide quick rehabilitation in the affected regions. By mid-September, ‚Ç¨420,000 ($527,000 USD) was provided to repair hospitals and an additional ‚Ç¨110,000 (US$138,000) was planned to be sent. By the end of September, health kits were provided for 300,000 people and an additional $300,000 (USD) was provided for medical supplies in hospitals. From October 15 to 18, a Rapid Nutritional Screening of children took place in the worst affected areas. Eleven hospitals were restocked with medical supplies and a permanent water supply was constructed at the Wonsan general hospital. About $180,000 in aid from Norway was sent to North Korea. By October 22, 2007, 80 percent of the $14.1 million pledged in assistance had been funded. About 4,800 tonnes of cereal was to be distributed in October as part of the second shipment of food, following the first which was sent prior to Wipha. Funds and materials, worth $166,000 (USD), for revegetation were expected to arrive between December 2007 and February 2008.

It was originally in Dedham with current branches in Somerville, Brookline, and South Weymouth in Massachusetts. Its permanent collection includes over 700 pieces of \\"art too bad to be ignored\\", 25 to 35 of which are on public display at any one time. MOBA was founded in 1994, after antique dealer Scott Wilson showed a painting he had recovered from the trash to some friends, who suggested starting a collection. Within a year, receptions held in Wilson's friends' home were so well-attended that the collection needed its own viewing space. The museum then moved to the basement of a theater in Dedham. Explaining the reasoning behind the museum's establishment, co-founder Jerry Reilly said in 1995: \\"While every city in the world has at least one museum dedicated to the best of art, MOBA is the only museum dedicated to collecting and exhibiting the worst.\\" To be included in MOBA's collection, works must be original and have serious intent, but they must also have significant flaws without being boring; curators are not interested in displaying deliberate kitsch. MOBA has been mentioned in dozens of off-the-beaten-path guides to Boston, featured in international newspapers and magazines, and has inspired several other collections throughout the world that set out to rival its own visual atrocities. Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine noted that the attention the Museum of Bad Art receives is part of a wider trend of museums displaying \\"the best bad art\\".Solomon, Deborah. \\"In Praise of Bad Art\\". The New York Times, January 24, 1999 The museum has been criticized for being anti-art, but the founders deny this, responding that its collection is a tribute to the sincerity of the artists who persevered with their art despite something going horribly wrong in the process. According to co-founder Marie Jackson, \\"We are here to celebrate an artist's right to fail, gloriously.\\"\\"The Gallery of the Garish Masterpieces of Bad Art\\". The Irish Times, September 18, 1999. 9 History The Museum of Bad Art was established in 1994 by antique dealer Scott Wilson, who discovered what has become the museum's signature piece‚ÄîLucy in the Field with Flowers‚Äîprotruding from between two trash cans on a Roslindale-area curb in Boston, among some garbage waiting to be collected. Wilson was initially interested only in the frame, but when he showed the picture to his friend Jerry Reilly, Reilly wanted both the frame and the painting. He exhibited Lucy in his home, and encouraged friends to look for other bad art and notify Wilson of what they found.Gaines, Judith. \\"Exhibiting Works of Trial and Error: Museum Finds Landscapes Gone Awry\\". The Boston Globe, May 4, 2003. 9 When Wilson acquired another \\"equally lovely\\" piece and shared it with Reilly, they decided to start a collection. Reilly and his wife, Marie Jackson, held a party in their basement to exhibit the collection to date, and hosted a reception they facetiously titled \\"The Opening of the Museum of Bad Art\\".English, Bella. .

The original stairwell entrance to the Museum of Bad Art and the men's restroom Regular showings of the pieces collected by Wilson, Reilly, and Jackson (and those donated by others), became too much for Reilly and Jackson's small home in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, as hundreds of people attended the receptions. The founders' initial attempt at dealing with their constrained exhibition space was to create the Virtual Museum Of Bad Art, a CD-ROM with a cast of 95 people that presented the MOBA art collection in a fictional imaginary museum.MOBS CD-ROM This fictional MOBA allowed the visitors not only to view the paintings but to go behind the scenes in the fictional museum. Word of the museum's collection continued to spread until, according to \\"Permanent Interim Acting Director\\" Louise Reilly Sacco, \\"it got completely out of hand\\" when a group of senior citizens on a tour bus stopped to see it. In 1995 the display space was moved to the basement of the Dedham Community Theatre, a building with an aesthetic described in 2004 as \\"ramshackle\\". The museum in Dedham had no fixed operating hours, instead being open while the theater upstairs was open.Museum of Bad Art \\".

Bad music was played during the public viewings to complete the ambiance. In an exhibition titled \\"Awash in Bad Art\\", 18 pieces of art were covered in shrink wrap for \\"the world's first drive-thru museum and car wash\\".

The Boston Globe, December 13, 2006. SID2 In 1996, the painting Eileen, by R. Angelo Le, vanished from MOBA. Eileen was acquired from the trash by Wilson, and features a rip in the canvas where someone slashed it with a knife even before the museum acquired it, \\"adding an additional element of drama to an already powerful work\\", according to MOBA.Portraiture #9 Eileen . Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 8, 2009. The museum offered a reward of $6.50 for the return of Eileen, and although MOBA donors later increased that reward to $36.73, the work remained unrecovered for many years.

According to Marie Jackson, \\"Nine out of ten pieces don't get in because they're not bad enough. What an artist considers to be bad doesn't always meet our low standards.\\"Swoger, Kate. \\"Bad Art Finds a Good Home at This Anti-Museum\\". Ottawa Citizen, February 26, 2000. K6 As stated in the introduction to The Museum of Bad Art: Masterworks, the primary attribute of an objet d'art to be acquired by MOBA is that it must have been seriously attempted by someone making an artistic statement. A lack of artistic skill is not essential for a work to be included; a prospective painting or sculpture for the collection ideally should \\"[result] in a compelling image\\", or as honorary curator Ollie Hallowell stated, the art must have an \\"Oh my God\\" quality. An important criterion for inclusion is that a painting or sculpture must not be boring. Michael Frank says they are not interested in commercial works like Dogs Playing Poker: \\"We collect things made in earnest, where people attempted to make art and something went wrong, either in the execution or in the original premise.\\" Montserrat College of Art used MOBA's exhibition as a demonstration to its students that \\"sincerity is still important, and pureness of intent is valid\\". MOBA accepts unsolicited works if they meet its standards. Frequently, curators consider works by artists who display an intensity or emotion in the art that they are unable to reconcile with their level of skill. The museum dedicated a show to \\"relentless creativity\\" in an exhibition titled \\"I Just Can't Stop\\" that was covered by local news and CNN.The MOBA news: The Museum of Bad Art (MOBA) Newsletter, Issue #36 Excerpt . Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 8, 2009. Other artists are clearly technically proficient, but attempted an experiment that did not end well. Michael Frank has compared some of the works at MOBA with outsider art or art brut; some MOBA artists' works are also included in other galleries' outsider collections.The Museum of Bad Art's Michael Frank Off Center (2009). Accessed, March 31, 2009. Dean Nimmer, a professor at the Massachusetts College of Art (also holding the title of MOBA's Executive Director of Good Taste), noted the parallels between the Museum of Bad Art's standards and those of other institutions: \\"They take the model of a museum of fine arts and apply the same kind of criteria to acceptance for bad work ... [Their rules] are very similar to a gallery or museum that says 'Well, our area is really installation art or realist paintings or neo-post-modern abstractions. MOBA does not collect art created by children, or art traditionally perceived as lesser in quality, such as black velvet paintings, paint-by-numbers, kitsch, or factory-produced art‚Äîincluding works specifically created for tourists. Curators are also not interested in crafts such as latch hook rug kits. MOBA curators suggest that more appropriate venues for such works would be the \\"Museum of Questionable Taste, The International Schlock Collection, or the National Treasury of Dubious Home Decoration\\". The Museum of Bad Art has been accused of being anti-art, or taking works that were sincerely rendered and mocking them. However, Scott Wilson insists that a work of art accepted into MOBA is a celebration of the artist's enthusiasm. Marie Jackson reiterated this thought, saying \\"I think it's a great encouragement to people... who want to create [and] are held back by fear, and when they see these pieces, they realize there's nothing to be afraid of‚Äîjust go for it.\\"Caro, Mark, \\"Not a Pretty Picture‚ÄîBoston-Area Museum a Monument to the Absolute Worst in Art\\". Chicago Tribune, May 20, 1997. 1 Louise Reilly Sacco agreed, stating, \\"If we're making fun of something, it's the art community, not the artists. But this is a real museum. It's 10 years. It's 6,000 people on a mailing list. It's recognition all over the world.\\"Cobb, Nathan. \\"In Dedham, This Museum is Exhibiting 'Bad\\" Taste\\". The Boston Globe, February 28, 2004. C1 Curators insist that artists whose works are selected by MOBA enjoy the attention and that it is a win-win; the museum gains another work of art, and the artist receives exposure in a museum. A 1997 article in The Chicago Tribune stated that none of the 10 to 15 artists who had stepped forward to acknowledge their work in MOBA had been upset. Many of the works in MOBA are donated, often by the artists themselves. Others come from yard sales or thrift stores; the Trash Collectors Union in Cambridge, Massachusetts has donated works rescued from imminent demise. Occasionally a painting may be purchased; at one time MOBA's policy was not to spend more than $6.50 on any piece. More recently, twice and even three times that amount has been paid for an exceptional work. Those pieces not retained by the museum are included in a \\"Rejection Collection\\" that may be sold at auction. In the past, some proceeds went to the Salvation Army for providing so many of MOBA's pieces; the museum itself usually benefits from most auctions. Collection highlights Each painting or sculpture MOBA exhibits is accompanied by a brief description of the medium, size, name of the artist, as well as how the piece was acquired, and an analysis of the work's possible intention or symbolism. Museums Journal noted that the discussion accompanying each work would most likely have most visitors reduced \\"to hysterics\\". The captions‚Äîdescribed as \\"distinctly tongue-in-cheek commentaries\\" by David Mutch of the Christian Science Monitor‚Äîwere primarily written by Marie Jackson, until the \\"dissolution of the MOBA interpretative staff\\"; the task was then taken over by Michael Frank and Louise Reilly Sacco.Frank and Sacco, xiv =Lucy in the Field with Flowers= Many of MOBA's works generate extensive discourse from visitors. Lucy in the Field with Flowers (oil on canvas by Unknown; acquired from trash in Boston) remains a favorite with the news media and patrons. As the first work acquired by the museum, Lucy is \\"a painting so powerful it commands its own preservation for posterity\\", setting a standard by which all future acquisitions would be compared, and causing MOBA's founders to question if Scott Wilson found Lucy or she found him. Kate Swoger of The Montreal Gazette called Lucy a \\"gorgeous mistake\\", describing her thus: \\"an elderly woman dancing in a lush spring field, sagging breasts flopping willy-nilly, as she inexplicably seems to hold a red chair to her behind with one hand and a clutch of daisies in the other\\". Author Cash Peters, using less florid language, summarized it as \\"the old woman with an armchair glued to her ass\\". MOBA's statement about Lucy reads: \\"The motion, the chair, the sway of her breast, the subtle hues of the sky, the expression on her face‚Äîevery detail combines to create this transcendent and compelling portrait, every detail cries out 'masterpiece'.\\"Portraiture #1 Lucy In the Field With Flowers . Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 4, 2009. The Times recounted comments left by a museum visitor regarding the \\"endless layers of mysteries\\" the image offers: \\"What is Norman Mailer's head doing on an innocent grandma's body, and are those crows or F-16s skimming the hills?\\"\\"So Bad It's Good: The Arts Online\\". The Times, March 25, 2006. 15 Lucy granddaughter, a Boston-area nurse named Susan Lawlor, became a fan of MOBA after seeing the portrait in a newspaper. She recognized it as her grandmother, Anna Lally Keane (c. 1890‚Äì1968); upon seeing the picture, Lawlor snorted Coca-Cola from her nose in astonishment. The painting was commissioned by her mother, and it hung in her aunt's house for many years, despite the trepidation family members felt at seeing the final composition. Says Lawlor: \\"The face is hauntingly hers, but everything else is so horribly wrong. It looks like she only has one breast. I'm not sure what happened to her arms and legs, and I don't know where all the flowers and yellow sky came from.\\" =Sunday on the Pot with George= Sunday on the Pot With George (acrylic on canvas by John Gedraitis; donated by Jim Schulman) has been deemed \\"iconic\\" by Bella English of The Boston Globe, who assures the work is \\"100 percent guaranteed to make you burst out laughing\\". Wilson has pointed to George as an example of a technically well- executed piece of art using a subject not usually seen rendered in paint. Many admirers of the first work donated to MOBA are hypnotized by the image of a portly man wearing \\"Y-front\\" underwear while sitting on a chamber pot, in pointillist impressionism similar to the style of Georges Seurat. One critic speculates the pointillist style in George may have been acquired \\"from watching too much TV\\". The title refers to the Stephen Sondheim musical Sunday in the Park with George, which contains a dramatic recreation of Seurat's painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. Author Amy Levin suggests that George is a pastiche of Seurat's painting.Levin, 198 The subject of this painting has been \\"tentatively identified\\" by the Annals of Improbable Research‚Äîthe creators of the Ig Nobel award‚Äîas John Ashcroft, former United States Attorney General. A visitor was so moved by George he felt compelled to express his gratitude for its display in the Dedham Community Theatre basement, writing \\"Someone had slipped into the bathroom as I took in this painting and began peeing loudly into a toilet. The reverberating sound of urine splashing while viewing George brought the painting to life, and when the denouement of the flush sounded, I wept.\\" MOBA's accompanying caption introduces questions and observations: \\"Can the swirling steam melt away the huge weight of George's corporate responsibilities? This pointillist piece is curious for meticulous attention to fine detail, such as the stitching around the edge of the towel, in contrast to the almost careless disregard for the subject's feet.\\"Portraiture #2 Sunday on the Pot With George . Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 4, 2009. =Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt= In contrast to the pointillist impressionism of George, the museum also features a \\"fine example of labor-intensive pointlessism\\", according to MOBA staff. Mari Newman's Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt (tempera and acrylic paint on canvas; donated by the artist), inspired this description by MOBA: \\"We can only wonder what possesses an artist to portray a dog juggling bones while wearing a hula skirt.\\"\\"Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt \\". Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 4, 2009. MOBA enjoys the mystery as much as any other aspect of art, however. Newman, a professional artist from Minneapolis, responded to the curators' cogitation by describing how the image came into being. She bought used canvases while a poor art student, and was unsure how to use a canvas with these dimensions. Inspired by a cartoon of a dachshund, she chose that as a subject, but was unhappy with the effect until she added a hula skirt she had seen in a magazine, and colored dog bones she spied in a pet store. Newman wrote to them, saying \\"I almost threw it out until I heard of MOBA. After many years of slashing rejected work, now I wish I had saved them all for you.\\" =Motifs and interpretations= Travel writer Cash Peters identifies six characteristics common to many of the museum's artworks. The first is that MOBA artists are unable to render hands or feet, and mask them by extending figures' arms off the canvas, hiding them with long sleeves, or placing shoes on feet in inappropriate scenarios. Second, Peters compared artists Rembrandt and J. M. W. Turner, masters of landscapes, who \\"could probably paint with their eyes shut\\" to MOBA artists who apparently did paint with their eyes shut, as skies are often painted in any color but blue, flora are created without reference to any existing plant organisms, and fauna appear so small in the background it is impossible to discern what kind of animals they are. Third, MOBA artists apply perspective inconsistently, either from one painting to the next, or within a single work. Peters's fourth observation concerns the difficulty MOBA artists seem to have in successfully rendering noses: he writes that a nose will be attempted so many times that the work takes on a third dimension as paint is reapplied over and over. Fifth, bad artists favor \\"mixed media\\": if in doubt, they glue feathers, glitter, or hair to their work. Lastly, Peters suggests that artists know their work is bad, but apparently feel the piece may be saved by including a monkey or a poodle in the composition. Since late 2008, MOBA has been experimenting with allowing the public to title and caption some works. According to the curatorial staff, since some of the works are so puzzling, mere artistic interpretation is not sufficient: they must be \\"interpretated\\". The \\"Guest Interpretator's Collection\\" is an invitation for MOBA's visitors to include their thoughts on compelling artworks; a contest decides the best analysis and these interpretations are added as each contest ends.\\"The Guest Interpretator's Collection \\". Museum of Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 3, 2009. A professor at Boston University offered his thoughts: \\"The location of the museum as much as its collection suggests a commitment to the abject and a belief in the power and force of culture's marginalized effects. I was also reminded that I need to pick up some toilet bowl cleaner on my way home!\\" Influence The Museum of Bad Art has been mentioned in hundreds of international publications, as well as in Boston-area travel guides highlighting offbeat attractions. It has inspired similar collections or events in Australia,Museum of Particularly Bad Art. Museum of Particularly Bad Art, 2009. Retrieved on March 3, 2009. Ohio,MOBA Newsletter .

The company commissioned six playwrights to write short plays based on MOBA artworks. Master Works: The MOBA Plays was originally performed in January and February 2009 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The plays were based on the MOBA pieces Mana Lisa, Invasion of the Office Zombies, My Left Foot, Bone-Juggling Dog in Hula Skirt, Gina's Demons, and Lulli, Fowl and Gravestone. After moving to Chicago, the company again produced The MOBA Plays in March and April 2011, using three of the original plays and translating three new paintings. =Responses to bad art= The Dedham Community Theater housed the first MOBA gallery in its basement.English, Bella. \\"Museum of Bad Art loses space in Dedham to exhibit its stuff\\", The Boston Globe (Jan. 12, 2013). Museum visitors can sign a guest book, and leave comments. One Canadian visitor wrote: \\"This collection is disturbing, yet I can't seem to look away...Just like a hideous car accident.\\" Another visitor warns: \\"Her nipples follow you around the room. Creepy!\\" Response to MOBA's opening and continued success is, for some, evocative of the way art is treated in society. MOBA works have been described as \\"unintentionally hilarious\\", similar to the atrocious films of Ed Wood.\\"Exhibit Preview: The Museum of Bad Art\\" . Fast Forward Weekly, September 17, 1998 Visitors‚Äîand even MOBA staff‚Äîoften laugh out loud at displays. In Gullible's Travels, Cash Peters contrasted this behavior with what is expected of patrons at galleries such as Southern California's Getty Museum; though viewers might find the art at the Getty equally hilarious, were they to show it they would almost certainly be thrown out. In 2006, Louise Reilly Sacco participated in a panel discussion with authorities on art and architecture about standards of beauty and ugliness in art, published in Architecture Boston. She remarked that teachers bring high school art students to MOBA, then to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (MFA). Sacco observes, \\"Somehow MOBA frees kids to laugh and point, to have their own opinions and argue about things. Then they take the experience to the MFA, where they might otherwise feel intimidated... Maybe the ugly ... frees us.\\" Sacco believes that extreme ugliness is more striking than extreme beauty, and it forces people to think more deeply about what is wrong or misplaced. She connects this rigid judgment of what does not conform to beauty with intolerance for physical imperfections in people, noting that such rigidity sometimes causes parents to \\"fix\\" the perceived flaws in their children's faces to keep them from suffering later. The Somerville Theatre houses a MOBA gallery in its basement. Jason Kaufman, a Harvard professor who teaches the sociology of culture, wrote that MOBA is part of a social trend he calls \\"annoyism\\", where mass media venues promote performances and artists who mix the deliberately bad with the clever. The Museum Of Bad Art happens to embody this trend, and further illustrates its central aim to mock the judgment system by which people identify what is bad from what is not. For Kaufman, \\"The beauty of MOBA‚Äîthough beauty is surely the wrong word‚Äîis the way it undermines aesthetic criteria from numerous angles.\\" Amy Levin, describing how American history and culture have been shaped by small local museums, suggests that MOBA is a parody of art itself, and that MOBA's commentary, newsletter, website, and publications mock museums as authorities on what is good art. The director of the Ellipse Arts Center, a gallery in Arlington, Virginia, that hosted a traveling exhibition of MOBA works, was astonished to see people's exuberant laughter because no one visiting the Ellipse had ever responded to art this way. She observed, \\"If I didn't have a sign on the door, people might not think it's so bad. Who's to say what's bad and what's good?\\"Lewis, Nicole. \\"For Badness' Sake\\". The Washington Post, October 8, 1998. D5 Deborah Solomon, in The New York Times Magazine, asserted that MOBA's success reflects a trend in modern art among artists and audiences. The arrival of abstraction and modern art in the early 20th century made art appreciation more esoteric and less accessible for the general community, showing that \\"the American public ... think[s] of museums as intimidating places ruled by a cadre of experts whose taste and rituals [seem] as mysterious as those of Byzantine priests.\\" Bad art is in vogue, as a movement that rejects the anti-sentimentalism that marked earlier disdain for artists such as Norman Rockwell or Gustave Moreau, according to Solomon. Garen Daly, a MOBA fan on several Boston-area art councils, stated in 1995, \\"I go to a lot of openings, and sometimes they're pretty damn stuffy.\\"Hirsch, James \\"Gosh, That's Awful! It Would Look Great Hanging in a Museum‚ÄîPainting Failures Are Displayed on Some Walls in Boston Dedication to 'Bad Art'.\\" The Wall Street Journal, July 12, 1995. A1 Not only does the Museum of Bad Art offer different fare for the eyes, but instead of the wine and cheese that is provided for most museum and art gallery visitors, a MOBA show provides its patrons with Kool-Aid, Fluffernutters and cheese puffs. =Use in academic research= The Museum of Bad Art has been used in academic studies as a standard of reference for the spectacularly awful. In one such study, published in Perspectives on Psychological Science, researchers tested the consistency of responses between people asked to make \\"gut\\" judgments versus those who gave conscious well-reasoned responses regarding the quality of various pieces of art. The researchers showed respondents images from MOBA and New York's Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), and asked them to rate each painting on a scale with two ends representing \\"Very Attractive\\" and \\"Very Unattractive\\". The study found that those who reasoned in conscious thought were neither more accurate nor as consistent in their ratings. Study participants identified and rated MoMA art higher quality, but those who used conscious reasoning did not find MoMA art more attractive than those who rated with \\"gut\\" judgments. Furthermore, the deliberators did not find MOBA art as unattractive as those with quicker response times. The study concluded that people who make quick judgments do so more consistently, with no significant change to accuracy. In another study that appeared in the British Journal of Psychology, researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from ArtCyclopedia by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Georges-Pierre Seurat, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more easily in the traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.

A member of the Quaker religious sect, he broke with the Society during the conservative reform movement and sponsored important legislation promoting military preparations for the French and Indian War. His politically incorrect comments about the Scotch Irish are still quoted. Biography Grubb was born in Brandywine Hundred, Delaware and was the son of John Grubb and his wife Frances. One of Nathaniel's brothers was Peter Grubb who founded Cornwall Furnace. By the mid-1720s, Nathaniel was a carpenter and a member of the Concord Friends Meetinghouse. His political career started in 1736 when he was appointed Willistown‚Äôs constable. Five years later, he assisted laying out a road from Chester County to High Street ferry in Philadelphia. In 1742, he became overseer of the poor and supervisor of highways two years later During the 1749 Assembly election, Chester County replaced four of its eight representatives, and three of the new freshmen including Grubb were Quakers. During his first five years, Grubb was a stanch Quaker backbencher. In 1753 he was one of eight Quakers to vote against all proposals to finance military preparations for the defense of Pennsylvania against the French threat. In 1755, Grubb changed his position. That year, six Quakers associated with the conservative reform movement resigned in protest. Nathaniel refused to join them and accepted an assignment to the seven-member committee considering the militia bill. That fall, many of the remaining Quakers refused to run for reelection and in 1756 another four resigned, including two from Chester County. However, Nathaniel remained in the Assembly and helped draft the bill that established guidelines for the use of privately owned wagons and horses to transport military supplies. In 1758, the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting condemned this bill as essentially repugnant to that liberty of conscience for which early Friends deeply suffered. Grubb however, was not formally censured for his role in its passage. Nathaniel occasionally made comments that were less than politically correct. For example, in 1756 William Smith‚Äôs \\"A Brief View of the Conduct of Pennsylvania\\" charged that Grubb declared after hearing the news of the attacks on frontier inhabitants that \\"they are a pack of insignificant Scotch-Irish, who, if they were all killed, could well enough be spared.\\" Grubb responded in the \\"Pennsylvania Gazette\\" that the report was \\"a wicked falsehood and without the least foundation.\\" During this period, Nathaniel also held several other significant posts. In 1755, he was appointed as a commissioner to provide for the Arcadian exiles in Philadelphia and three years later served as a Trustee of the Province Loan office. During his last year in the Assembly, he helped draft the law changing the terms under which Judges held their office. About this time, his wife died and Nathaniel did not stand for reelection in the fall of 1758 because of failing health. Personal life On 10th mo. 23, 1725, Nathaniel Grubb married Ann Moore, daughter of John and Margaret Moore of Thornbury Township and had eight children. They settled in Willistown Township where he purchased by deed of November 16, 1726. Nathaniel and Ann became members of the Goshen Meeting, but were not especially active in church affairs. In addition to his mill on Crum Creek, he also owned property in Marcus Hook and several houses and lots in Philadelphia, which apparently he rented to tenants.

He served as a member of the Parliament of Norway during the term 1973‚Äì1977, representing Buskerud, and was a member of the Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs. Background and career K√•re √òistein Hansen was born in Drammen, Buskerud, in Norway. He was the son of municipal social welfare officer Harald Bernhard Hansen (1894-1970) and textile worker and housewife Gudrun, born Hansen (1893-1989). K√•re √òistein went to primary and secondary school in Drammen, but his education was interrupted in 1942. His father became a member of NS, Nasjonal Samling (National Unification, a political party collaborating with the German occupants) during the second world war and enrolled his son in the NS Youth Association. K√•re √òistein was sent as an apprentice to one of the vocational schools of the NS Youth Association in Oslo and joined the German Ski Hunter Battalion in 1944. After the war he was arrested and sentenced to imprisonment for treason and complicity in murder. He was 17 years old when the murder took place (Drammen City Court, 24 Nov 1947). After serving his prison term K√•re √òistein Hansen got a job as a repairman in 1948, obtained a certificate of completed apprenticeship as a mechanic and worked as a mechanic, fitter and turner in two factories in Drammen from 1949 to 1978. After he left parliament, Hansen became labor inspector in Oslo 1978-83 and safety deputy in the welfare services for the elderly in Oslo 1983-90, when he retired. Hansen took courses for union officials, commercial school and the school of the Norwegian Federation of Trade Unions. For 12 years he was leader of the local trade union and became member of the executive committees of the regional and national Iron and Metal Workers' Union. Member of Parliament In 1971 K√•re √òistein Hansen was elected to the local council in Drammen and the county council in Buskerud for the Labor party. But he was against Norwegian membership in the Common Market and became chair of the Democratic Socialists AIK, Buskerud, a dissenter group from the Labor Party, that joined SV, Sosialistisk Valgforbund (Socialist Alliance, later the Socialist Left Party) before the elections in 1973. Hansen was elected to parliament 1973-77 and was member of the SV national party board 1975-77. Some quarters criticized Hansen and SV, when Hansen was elected to parliament, because of his sentence for treason. But Hansen received broad support. He had settled his account, and people who worked with him, described him as an honest and exceptionally thoughtful person. So he served his whole term. Personal life K√•re Hansen was an active sportsman and had a number of tasks in the local and national football organizations. In 1949 Hansen married Laila Johanne, born Kaldestad (1928-2012) and they had three children. He was divorced in 1977 and later married Torild Skard (1936- )who also was a Member of Parliament.

It was used to support the Global Atmospheric Research Program (GARP) during 1978‚Äì1984. An earlier launch, NOAA-B, was scheduled to become NOAA-7, however NOAA-B failed to reach its required orbit. The launch of NOAA-7 took place at 10:52:59 UTC (3:53 a.m. PST) on June 23, 1981 from Space Launch Complex 3W at the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. NOAA-7 was launched atop an Atlas E/F rocket with a Star-37S-ISS upper stage. The NOAA-7 satellite had a mass of . The satellite's design provided an economical and stable sun synchronous platform for advanced operational instruments to measure the Earth's atmosphere, its surface and cloud cover, and the near space environment. The primary sensors included an Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) and a TIROS Operational Vertical Sounder (TOVS). One of the primary mission sensors, the High Resolution Infrared Radiation Sounder (HIRS), failed February 7, 1985. There were a number of secondary experiments on-board NOAA-7. These include a Space Environment Monitor (SEM) and a Data Collection and Platform Location System (DCPLS). The United States Air Force also provided a contamination monitor to assess contamination sources, levels and effects for consideration on future spacecraft. NOAA-7 was based upon the Block 5D spacecraft bus developed for the U.S. Air Force. The satellite was capable of maintaining an earth-pointing accuracy of better than ¬±0.1¬∞ with a motion rate of less than 0.035 degrees/second. NOAA-7 was withdrawn from use in June 1986 after its power system malfunctioned. In August 1997 the decommissioned satellite experienced an abrupt 1 second change in orbital period. At the same time 3 new debris particles were observed. It is unclear if this was caused by an internal release of energy or collision with an unidentified object. As of December 8, 2013, the derelict satellite remains in a orbit, inclined at 98.87 degrees and with a period of 101.62 minutes.

(WAVE) was a nonprofit youth development, education, and youth workforce development organization founded in 1969 in Newark, Delaware. The organization announced its dissolution in December 2009. Background Under its original name, 70,001 Ltd., the organization operated the 70,001 Career Association (SEVCA) and seeded programs in multiple states that reconnected school dropouts to work and education with funds from the US Department of Labor.Institute for Educational Leadership, 1990Academy for Educational Development, 1994 In the 1980s, WAVE also began working with schools to design methods for effective dropout prevention. 700 schools and community-based organizations serving approximately 700,000 youth eventually implemented such programs.Michael Ben- Avie, PhD, \\"Underprepared for the Business Sector,\\" Journal of Business Management and Change, Spring 2008 * UT Knoxville WAVE Program based in Tennessee * WAVE provided professional development, curriculum, technical assistance, and other supports to schools and youth programs that implemented WAVE programs locally. WAVE offered five main program approaches that any school or organization can adapt and implement: * WAVE In Middle Grades, for students in grades 6-8, usually in a classroom setting * WAVE In Schools, for high school students, usually in a classroom setting * WAVE 9th Grade Academy, for ninth graders in schools with an Academy system * WAVE After School, for middle school or high school students in a setting outside of school time * WAVE In Communities, a program model for school dropouts in a community-based setting WAVE is featured in Grad Nation: A Guidebook to Help Communities Tackle The Dropout Crisis as a provider of program designs for out-of-school youth (dropouts) and a research-based intervention for disconnected youth and a national provider of technical assistance to schools and communities wishing to improve the educational and career outcomes of young people. WAVE was a national partner in the America's Promise. Eight independent research studies have been published on WAVE's impact. Key Findings noted by Michael Ben-Avie, PhD of the Yale Child Study Center and Impact Analysis and Strategies Group in 2008 include evidence that: # Participation in a WAVE program makes students more likely to make academic gains, stay in school, and secure employment. # Participation in a WAVE program stretches youth's orientation to the future, making youth more likely to plan for their future. # As a result of participation in a WAVE program, youth who were once \\"disconnected\\" from school and community begin to seek more adult guidance and feel a sense of belonging # WAVE programs promote leadership skills that poorly performing students need to defy negative predictions that have been made about their futures. # The more hours of WAVE instruction that students complete, the more likely they are to advance to the next grade level. # Teachers and school administrators observe that WAVE participation is essential to the developmental growth of their students. # WAVE programs demystify the world of work. # WAVE programs deliver content relevant to the lives of young people in a challenging but safe and supportive learning environment. written in 2006 by Civic Enterprises for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, cites this as a key precursor to keeping adolescents engaged in school. WAVE was featured in the Catalogue for Philanthropy, which reviews and selects charitable organizations that meet criteria for efficiency, effectiveness, transparency, impact, and value to the community.

The third book of the series, Fallout, was published in 2010. Like the previous novel in the series, Glass has been the subject of controversy, with the book being partially responsible for a public appearance by Hopkins getting cancelled due to parental complaints.Ellen Hopkins: Crank It Up School Library Journal Plot Kristina thinks that now she has a baby to care for and love, she can quit her addiction. But she finds herself searching for Robyn, her old contact for the \\"street crank\\". While at Robyn's house she meets a boy named Trey and starts to crave for people to look like they want or need her. Once she gets home, she begins to work at a 7-Eleven to get the money to buy more crank. The manager there is a porn dealer and offers her a job as a prostitute, but she declines. After learning that her father is coming to her mother's home to be at the christening of her new baby, Hunter Seth, she begs her mother to let him come and she agrees, on the condition that Kristina has to be the one to tell her older sister. Once her father comes, he takes her to casinos for her eighteenth birthday party and they snort some lines while there. This causes Kristina to be almost late for Hunter's christening, but she manages to make it on time. Meanwhile, Kristina has started dating Trey and began smoking \\"glass\\", which is much more harmful than smoking crank because it is pure meth in rock size quantities. Kristina begins to smoke it every day, becoming skinnier and crashing more often. After crashing one day, her mother kicks her out of the house because she didn't even try to help Hunter, who had rolled himself under a chair and couldn't get out. Kristina then moves in with Brad, Trey's cousin, while serving as the babysitter of Brad's two young daughters, Devon and LeTreya. She quits working at 7-Eleven by using blackmail and gets a call from Robyn. After finding out that Robyn now works at a \\"whorehouse\\", Kristina goes over and is able to sell the girls ice, instead of street crank, which was the only meth they'd had access to. Trey leaves for college and Kristina soon finds herself becoming attracted to Brad. After Trey comes home, she asks him why he hadn't been answering the phone and he responds with that he had been seeing a girl for sex only and that he still loved Kristina. She passes out and finds him gone. This saddens Kristina and she begins to have sex with Brad. When Trey comes home, he finds Kristina sleeping with Brad but instead of getting mad at her, he starts having sex with her while Brad is sleeping. Brad's estranged wife Angela comes back because she wants another try to be together with Brad. Brad kicks Kristina out. Kristina is forced to move into a motel nearby. She is also able to meet the man that gives Brad the crystal meth, Cesar. Once Trey comes back, he confesses to Kristina that the girl he had been sleeping with was Angela until she came back to Brad. He was also forced to move out. She agrees to him moving in and they soon begin to live together. They then move to an apartment together. Kristina asks her mother if she can bring Hunter over to her apartment so Hunter could stay with his mother and stepfather. But Kristina gives him back when she finds Hunter on the ground after having fallen from his high chair. She realizes that her mother was right and that she is not ready to raise Hunter. Kristina, desperate for some money, steals most of her mother's jewelry and check books. When Kristina gets a court order because her mother thinks that Kristina is an unfit mother, she and Trey decide to make a run for it after a picture of her is put in the newspaper asking for people to turn her in. They soon arrive in California with only a few pairs of clothes, all their meth, and money. They fall asleep in the car after a meal at McDonald's and are awakened by a cop. He asks them to step outside and he finds the half pound of crystal meth. They are arrested and taken to jail. They have to stay the entire weekend and during this time Kristina detoxes from the meth. Because Kristina had a history in Nevada, she and Trey are put behind home state bars. They are offered the chance of ratting on Cesar to shorten their jail sentence to six months which they agree to. During her checkup, Kristina finds out that she is pregnant with Trey's baby and hopes the baby is a girl so that Kristina will be able to love the baby like she should have done with Hunter. She hopes she can stay in touch with Trey and if not she knows she will with Quade. The novel ends with Kristina hoping that things will get better in her life even though she has no reason to be hopeful.

Like a private sector resume, it contains a summary or listing of relevant job experience and education. A Federal resume is one of three documents accepted as an official application for position vacancies within the Federal government. The other two are the OF-612 and the traditional SF-171. The SF‚Äì171 is considered obsolete and is no longer accepted by most government agencies. A standard private-sector resume should not be used to apply for Federal positions. Not only is the format different in terms of structure, length and content, but a Federal resume must include all the information required by a job announcement. Applications not following these guidelines will not be considered. Federal resumes are written in chronological resume format. Specific information is required to be included on federal resumes so that applicants can be rated uniformly. This additional information is not typically requested on private sector resumes, and resumes that do not include it will likely be rejected. This information includes: Job Information (Announcement number, title, series and grade of job for which applying) Personal Information (Full name, mailing address w/ zip code, day and evening phone numbers w/ area code, social security #, country of citizenship, veteran‚Äôs preference, reinstatement eligibility, highest Federal civilian grade held) Education (High school: name, city, and state, date of diploma or GED, Colleges or universities: name, city and state, majors, type and year of any degrees received) Work Experience (Job title, duties and accomplishments, employer‚Äôs name and address, supervisor‚Äôs name and phone number, starting and ending dates, hours per week, salary, statement either giving or withholding permission to contact current supervisor) Other Qualifications (Job-related training courses, skills, certificates and licenses, honors, awards and special accomplishments; for example, publications, memberships in professional or honor societies, leadership activities, public speaking and performance awards) Federal resumes usually cover the last ten years of employment history and are often three to five pages long when printed. Federal resumes sometimes require KSA as a separate document, but this information is often included within the resume itself. The commonly accepted Outline Format resume, developed by Kathryn Troutman in the 1990s,http://www.resume-place.com/books/federal-resume-guidebook/ uses short paragraphs to describe duties and bulleted lists of accomplishments to illustrate KSAs. The USAJOBS website offers an online resume builder. Job counselors for the federal government recommend use of the builder to create online USAJOBS resumes for two reasons: the builder will helps ensure that all required content is included, and the builder makes the resume \\"searchable\\" by HR specialists. The site will allows uploading of up to 5 resumes, in addition to other necessary documents listed in the job announcement (such as a DD Form 214 for veterans, or non-official copies of college/university transcripts). Many USAJOBS announcements are time-sensitive, and the process of creating a federal resume for the first time and gaining access to the various elements of the USAJOBS application system and any companion systems can take upwards of 2 hours.

It was established in 1868 and, as of 2018, has a congregation of about 13,000. In 2017, weekly attendance for worship services was reported around 3,700 and online attendance was over 10,000 The church, considered influential among evangelical Christians in the United States, also owns and operates a school, several radio stations, and Dallas Life, a mission for the homeless on the southern edge of Downtown Dallas. The current pastor is Dr. Robert Jeffress. History Historic building The First Baptist Church of Dallas was established on July 30, 1868, with eleven founding members. They convened in the Masonic Hall, located on Lamar Street near Ross Avenue. In 1872, the congregation pooled their funds together to purchase the first building, on Akard, in downtown Dallas. The cornerstone of the sanctuary that the congregation worships in today was laid in 1891. Since the 1970s, the church has established a number of ministries that are affiliated with the church. First Baptist Academy of Dallas and Criswell College (formerly Criswell Bible Institute) were formed to champion Christian education. In the mid-1970s, Criswell College purchased KCBI to be used as a Christian radio station. The station has resided on the lower frequencies of FM. Now at 90.9 FM, KCBI broadcasts as part of the Criswell Radio Network, and includes KCCE and KSAO of San Angelo, Texas, and KCBK of Frederick, Oklahoma. In 2013, Ted Cruz, invited by Robert Jeffress, attended the church and gave a speech on faith and the U.S. Constitution to the congregation. Jeffress praised Cruz as \\"a strong leader and a committed Christian\\". In 2013, a 3,000 seat Worship Center and expansion was built at the cost of $130 million, close to the historic building. The center has of space, and the older facilities were also renovated. Senior pastors W. W. Harris was the first pastor and was followed by several others during the early years of the church. In 1897, the first of the two most notable pastors, George Truett, accepted the position of Pastor and remained there until his death in July 1944. In 1944, Dr. W. A. Criswell became the pastor of the church. During his tenure, the church expanded to multiple buildings covering five blocks in Downtown Dallas, eventually becoming the largest Southern Baptist church in the world. Dr. Criswell became Senior Pastor in 1990 and Pastor Emeritus from 1995 until his death in 2002. Since 1990, four pastors have held the pulpit: Joel Gregory, O. S. Hawkins, Mac Brunson, and, currently, Robert Jeffress. Membership American evangelist Rev. Billy Graham became a member of the First Baptist Church of Dallas in 1953 while visiting Dallas during his crusade to the area and remained a church member for over fifty years, despite not residing within the Dallas area and only very infrequently visiting the Dallas church. In 2008, the 90-year-old Graham switched his church membership to First Baptist Church of Spartanburg, South Carolina, that was closer to his residence in North Carolina.  Facilities  In 2013, First Baptist Dallas completed a major renovation and expansion of their facilities, including construction of a new worship center. With a price tag of $130,000,000 it is the most expensive Protestant building project in modern history. In 2019 they announced another $35,000,000 expansion to the Horner Family Center and the addition of a new parking garage, growing the Family Center to 179,000 square feet from an original 98,500 preexisting square footage. FBC Dallas has a 3,000 seat worship center as well as a large skywalk. It also contains computer-synchronized water fountain playing music. Despite implosion of a large portion of their six-block campus, First Baptist retains the original worship center (in addition to its new worship center) as an ancillary venue for worship services, weddings and other events. Controversies W. A. Criswell, in a discussion of racial integration, stated that he expressed astonishment at the cowardice of ministers \\"whose forebears [sic] and predecessors were martyrs and were burned at the stake\\", but who themselves refuse to speak up about \\"this thing of integration\\". True ministers, he argued, must passionately resist government mandated desegregation because it is \\"a denial of all that we believe in\\".http://jsr.fsu.edu/Volume10/Freeman.pdf In September 1992, senior pastor Joel C. Gregory announced his resignation. Later, he published a book detaling his reasons for leaving: among them, the refusal of W.A Criswell to relinquish control of the church, despite Gregory being the senior pastor de jure Current pastor Jeffress has spoken out in the past against Muslims, Jews, Catholics, Mormons and homosexuals, claiming that Islam \\"promoted pedophilia\\". In 2008, Jeffress, in his sermon \\"Gay Is Not OK\\",The Savior_Robert Jeffress_of First Baptist Dallas stated that \\"What they [homosexuals] do is filthy. It is so degrading that it is beyond description. And it is their filthy behavior that explains why they are so much more prone to disease.\\"How First Baptist's Robert Jeffress Ordained Himself to Lead America, Michael J. Mooney, D Magazine, January 2012 In September 2010, Pastor Jeffress branded Islam as an \\"evil, evil religion\\". And in December 2010, Jeffress established a \\"Naughty and Nice List\\" where businesses are identified based on whether or not they openly celebrated Christmas, saying \\"I wanted to do something positive to encourage businesses to acknowledge Christmas and not bow to the strident voices of a minority who object to the holiday.\\" Also in 2010, he referred to Roman Catholicism as a \\"Satanic\\" result of \\"Babylonian mystery religion\\". In October 2011 at the Values Voter Summit, Jeffress branded The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) as \\"a cult\\". He received widespread criticism for his statement, but has not retracted it despite then U.S. presidential candidate and LDS church member Mitt Romney's request for him to do so.

It includes buildings nearby, as well as the square itself. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. DescriptionBoundaries= The Main Street Market Square District has irregular boundaries. The district includes all of the blocks between Travis and Main from Texas Street to the northern boundary of University of Houstown-Downtown. From the southern edge of Market Square at Preston Street, it captures all of the blocks northward until Buffalo Bayou. It includes three and a half blocks between Main and Fannin Streets, running south from Franklin Street. A wedge-shaped, partial block at Milam falls within the district, as well as a partial block east of Main Street at the base of the viaduct. =Features= (formerly the Merchants and Manufacturers Building), located on the campus of the University of Houston‚ÄìDowntown The University of Houston‚ÄìDowntown (UHD) is a four-year state university, located within the Main Street Market Square Historic District. Founded in 1974, it is one of four separate and distinct institutions in the University of Houston System. UHD has an enrollment of 12,900 students‚Äîmaking it the 13th largest public university in Texas and the second-largest university in the Houston area. One of the anchors of the district is Market Square Park, so-named because this site previously hosted four Houston City Halls and City Markets. Adjacent to the park are three nineteenth-century structures: the Fox-Kuhlman Building at 305-307 Travis, the Baker-Meyer Building at 315 Travis, and the Kennedy Bakery Building at 813 Congress. Like the Kennedy Bakery Building, the property at 214 Travis had been owned by Irish-born baker, John Kennedy. He started a building there in 1860. WL Foley Dry Goods commissioned Eugene Heiner to enlarge the structure in 1889. Across the street at 201 Travis is the Houston National Bank, once owned by Ross S. Sterling. Houston Ice and Brewing Company built the Magnolia Brewery Building at 110 Milam and the Magnolia Ballroom an adjacent facility at 715 Franklin. Eugene Heiner designed two other buildings in the district: the 1882 Henry Brashear Building at 910 Prairie, and the Sweeney and Coombs Building at 310 Main. Other historic buildings in the district along Main Street include the Rice Hotel, the Barringer-Norton Building, the Scanlan Building (Houston), the adjacent Stuart and Sterne Buildings, the Sweeney, Coombs, and Fredericks Building, and the Union National Bank Building.

He is the eleventh and current Bishop of Harrisburg, in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. He previously served as the second Bishop of Lexington in Kentucky, before being named to Harrisburg. Early life Ronald Gainer was born in Pottsville, Pennsylvania, as an only child to parents of Eastern European descent. He attended St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Overbrook, from where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1969 and a Master's degree in Divinity in 1973. He was ordained to the priesthood on May 19, 1973. Gainer served as pastor of Holy Trinity Church in Whitehall. Within the Diocese of Allentown, he served as Secretary of the Diocesan Tribunal, Secretary for Catholic Life and Evangelization, and Judicial Vicar. He did his graduate studies at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome, earning a Licentiate in canon law in 1986. He was raised to the rank of Honorary Prelate of His Holiness on August 20, 1991. Bishop of Lexington On December 13, 2002, Gainer was appointed the second Bishop of Lexington, Kentucky, by Pope John Paul II. He received his episcopal consecration on the following February 22 from Archbishop Thomas Cajetan Kelly, OP, with Bishops Edward Peter Cullen and Joseph Edward Kurtz serving as co-consecrators. In 2004, Gainer urged pro- choice Catholic politicians to refrain from receiving Communion.

The policy goes on to require male wrestlers to forfeit matches against female opponents, but does not bar tackle football or rugby teams from playing against teams which may have a girl on their team. According to the policy, the ban applies to sports \\"...that involve substantial and potentially immodest physical contact\\". =Response to clergy sex abuse and grand jury investigation= In early 2016, a grand jury investigation, led by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, began an inquiry into sexual abuse by Catholic clergy in six Pennsylvania dioceses: Harrisburg, Allentown, Scranton, Pittsburgh, Greensburg, and Erie. The Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown and the Archdiocese of Philadelphia were not included, as they had been the subjects of earlier investigations. According to The Philadelphia Inquirer, in 2017 the Diocese of Harrisburg and the Diocese of Greensburg attempted to shut down the grand jury investigation. On July 27, 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ordered that a redacted copy of the grand jury report be released to the public; this release is anticipated to occur in early August 2018. On August 1, 2018, Bishop Gainer disclosed the names of 71 past and present clergy affiliated with the Diocese of Harrisburg who were accused of sexually abusing children. Among these 71, the majority are already deceased, and some were accused only after their deaths. Gainer explained the rationale for the release of this information: \\"While these men are not a risk to the public, I still felt compelled to release their names in an effort to confirm for those brave survivors... that we have heard their cries and taken them seriously.\\" Gainer also stated that prior to 2002, some lawsuits had been settled using confidentiality clauses, and he was now releasing all victims from such confidentiality agreements. Immediately following the disclosure, Gainer announced that the name of every man who had served as a bishop in the Diocese of Harrisburg since 1947 would be removed from any building or room named in their honor, due to their failure to protect victims from abuse.

Its assignment is with the 53d Test Management Group, based at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida. The squadron is one of the oldest in the United States Air Force, its origins dating to March 1918, being organized at Brooks Field, Texas, as a training Squadron during World War I. The squadron saw combat during World War II, and became part of the Air Defense Command during the Cold War. Overview The 29th Training Systems Squadron has personnel located at Eglin AFB and 11 geographically separated units around the nation: Barksdale, Beale, Creech, Dyess, Hill, Offutt, Robins, Tinker, Tyndall, and Whiteman AFBs as well as an operating location in Mesa, Ariz. The squadron serves as the Combat Air Force's center of expertise for Aircrew Training Devices. Squadron personnel provide technical expertise on all aspects of ATD life-cycle management, including acquisition, modification, acceptance testing and certification testing for all A-10, B-1, B-2, B-52, E-3, E-4, E-8, EC-130, F-15C/E, F-16, F-22, F-35, HH-60, HC-130, MQ-1/9, RC-135, RQ-4 and U-2 ATDs. Unit personnel also manage the CAF Simulator Certification Program. The squadron's efforts incorporate ATD oversight and management from concept development and preliminary design review through sustainment and program deactivation. By keeping training devices concurrent, cost effective and viable, the 29th TSS guarantees training systems meet present and future warfighters' needs while supporting evolving training demands with modern technology. HistoryWorld War I= The first predecessor of the squadron was the 29th Aero Squadron, which was organized at Camp Knox, Kentucky in the fall of 1918, shortly before the end of World War I. It equipped with Curtiss JN-4 and Curtiss JN-6H aircraft, which it apparently operated from Camp Knox's airfield, Godman Field, as the aerial support unit for a field artillery brigade until it was demobilized in September 1919. =Panama Canal Zone= It was reactivated in the Panama Canal Zone at Albrook Field on 1 October 1933. On 6 December 1939, it was redesignated as the 29th Pursuit Squadron (Interceptor) and, between 1933 and 1939, had operated, in series, the Boeing P-12, Boeing P-26A Peashooter and Curtiss P-36A Hawk. Curtiss P-40C Warhawk, May 1942, Madden Field, Panama. Squadron ID #42 Bell P-39K-1-BE Airacobra 42-4251, Madden Field, Panama. After the Pearl Harbor Attack, the squadron had nine new Curtiss P-40E Warhawks, one of the first Canal Zone units to receive the new fighters, although at least one P-40C was also on hand. The Squadron was placed on General Alert at 15:00, 7 December 1941, at which time all 10 P¬¨40E's on hand were basically combat ready. Still at Albrook at the time, the unit later was the first to move to Calzada Larga Airfield, Panama (later named Madden Field). The unit was redesignated as the 29th Fighter Squadron on 15 May 1942. On 29 August 1942, Flight \\"C\\" of the squadron was transferred from Madden to remote Talara Airport, Peru, to provide aerodrome defense for the installations there and was relieved there by \\"E\\" Flight by December (although this was redesignated as \\"0\\" Flight, 51st Fighter Squadron concurrently that month). By January 1943, with the main body still at Madden Field with 18 aircraft, the unit was starting conversion to Bell P-39K Airacobras. By October 1943, still at Madden Field, the squadron also had a flight detached to Aguadulce Army Airfield, Panama. Effective 1 November 1943, with the dissolution of the 16th Fighter Group, the squadron was subordinated directly to the XXVI Fighter Command. =Replacement training= The squadron continued on at Madden Field until 25 March 1944, when the unit moved to Lincoln Army Airfield, Nebraska and being assigned to IV Fighter Command as a replacement training unit, flying predominantly Lockheed P-38 Lightnings. The squadron was later assigned to California where it was assigned to perform testing of the Bell P-59 Airacomet and Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star jet aircraft based at Muroc Dry Lake (later Edwards Air Force Base). The early jets provided USAAF pilots and ground crews with valuable data about the difficulties and pitfalls involved in converting to jet aircraft. This information proved quite useful when more advanced jet fighters finally became available in quantity. The squadron later moved to several other airfields in California providing transition training to new jet pilots until being inactivated in July 1946. =Air Defense Command= 29th FIS F-94C Scorpion 51-3584 about 1955 It was reactivated in 1953 as part of Air Defense Command as an air defense squadron, and equipped with Lockheed F-94C Starfire day interceptors. It was assigned to Great Falls AFB, Montana with a mission for the air defense of the Upper Midwest region. It was re- equipped in 1957 with Northrop F-89H Scorpion Interceptor and later with the F-89J. It received the new McDonnell F-101B Voodoo supersonic interceptor, and the F-101F operational and conversion trainer in 1960. The two-seat trainer version was equipped with dual controls, but carried the same armament as the F-101B and were fully combat-capable. On 22 October 1962, before President John F. Kennedy told Americans that missiles were in place in Cuba, the squadron dispersed one third of its force, equipped with nuclear tipped missiles to Billings Logan Field at the start of the Cuban Missile Crisis.McMullen, pp. 10‚Äì12NORAD/CONAD Participation in the Cuban Missile Crisis, p. 16 These planes returned to Malmstrom after the crisis.

History The ≈ûemsi Pasha Mosque was designed by Ottoman imperial architect Mimar Sinan for Grand Vizier ≈ûemsi Pasha. The Mosque is one of the smallest to be commissioned by a Grand Vizier in Constantinople, however it is its miniature dimensions combined with its picturesque waterfront location which have made it one of the most attractive mosques in the city. The Mosque is a celebrated example of the chief architect's skill in organically blending architecture with the natural landscape. Architecture The complex stands on a roughly rectangular site aligned east-west with the Bosphorus shoreline. The square, single domed mosque abuts the coast at an angle, with the adjoining mausoleum of the donor projecting towards the waterfront. The garden, which over-looks the Bosphorus, is surrounded on two sides by the madrasa, with the mosque on the third side and the sea wall on the fourth. The mosque itself is unusual in that the tomb of ≈ûemsi Ahmet is joined to the main building, divided from the interior by a grille. The chamber is crowned by a mirror vault at the height of the prayer hall drum. It has three casement windows facing the Bosphorus and nine upper windows on three walls, adorned with coloured glass. Surrounding the Mosque is a larger complex, situated on the coast of √úsk√ºdar, also built by court architect Sinan near the ≈ûemsi Pasha Palace and, according to the inscription over the mosque portal, construction was completed in 1580. In 1940, an extensive restoration project was undertaken by the General Directorate of Religious Endowments, supervised by architect S√ºreyya Y√ºcel. The complex stands on a roughly rectangular site aligned east-west with the Bosphorus shoreline. The square, single domed mosque abuts the coast at an angle, with the adjoining tomb of the donor projecting towards the waterfront. Its precinct is enclosed by an L-shaped madrasa to the west and south, and a seawall with grill-windows to the north, giving the impression that one is in a picture gallery looking at framed Bosphorus seascapes. The complex has two gates, one facing the land and the other facing the sea; the land gate opens to a private walled cemetery which occupies the eastern precinct, behind the mosque's qibla wall, which has become a burial site for generations of ≈ûemsi Pasha. A gate along the seawall opens into the precinct courtyard, which is shared by the mosque and the madrasa. A secondary gate along the cemetery wall to the east also leads to this courtyard via a narrow passage. The mosque portico, which envelops the prayer hall to the northwest and southwest, is faced across the courtyard with the madrasa arcade, at a smaller scale. Both the portico and arcade are covered by shed roofs and have pointed arches carried on columns with diamond-cut capitals. The mosque portico was rebuilt during the 1940 restoration. A single minaret with a single balcony rises above it, adjoining the southwest corner of the prayer hall. Entered through a marble portal on its northwest wall, the prayer hall is surmounted by a single dome, which measures about eight meters in diameter. The transition to the dome is achieved with four squinches over an octagonal drum pierced with four arched windows. The prayer hall has nine casement windows ‚Äì two on each wall with an additional window on the southeast wall. Each casement is topped by an arched window with a different coloured glass composition, and a circular window is placed above the mihrab. The simple marble mihrab has a muqarnas hood. Muqarnas carvings were also used to highlight the springing of the squinch arches. The wooden minbar is a modern replacement. The mausoleum is attached to the prayer hall. It is entered from the outside from northwest, but opens into the prayer hall with a grilled archway. The chamber is crowned by a mirror vault at the height of the prayer hall drum. It has three casement windows facing the Bosphorus and nine upper windows on three walls, adorned with colored glass. Decoration is limited to the stalactite carvings of the portal and painted floral and geometrical motifs on the mirror vault. Although its portal inscription was lost, inscriptive plaques over the archway in the prayer hall were preserved. The tomb, like the mosque and the complex, are made of cut stone. The L-shaped madrasa has twelve domed cells and a large classroom, all fronted by an arcade whose shed roof is carried by nineteen columns. Cells are placed all in a row except at the northern end, where a single cell encloses the arcade before the seawall. The classroom, which is seven meters squared, occupies the centre of the western wing of and projects beyond the madrasa wall. It is surmounted by a dome carried on squinches and raised on an octagonal drum. There are six windows on three of the classroom's walls, leaving the western wall for a furnace and two shelving niches. Each madrasa cell has two windows, a furnace and one or two shelving niches. The arcade was enlarged following the restoration and the madrasa was refurnished to house a Library in 1953 with the classroom use as the reading room. An additional room with privy cells is attached at the end of the southern wing.

It was called \\"Power vs. Precision\\" and was held on November 22, 2008 at the MGM Grand Las Vegas. The fight was won by Ricky Hatton as Paulie Malignaggi was withdrawn by his corner during the 11th round. Build-up Ricky Hatton had been at the top of the rankings since his victory over Kostya Tszyu and followed up with wins over Juan Urango, Jos√© Luis Castillo and Juan Lazcano. Malignaggi was the former IBF champion who had beaten the likes of Herman NGoudjo and Lovemore N'Dou. Both of the fighters fought on the same bill in Manchester, England at Hatton's Homecoming fight at the City of Manchester Stadium following his loss to Floyd Mayweather, Jr., Hatton winning a unanimous decision against Juan Lazcano and Malignaggi winning a split decision against Lovermore N'Dou. During Malignaggi's fight he had to get a haircut in between the rounds. Another Major event that preceded the fight was the firing of long term trainer Billy Graham by Hatton and employing Floyd Mayweather, Sr., father of the only man to beat him, at that time, into his corner. Malignaggi's trainer Buddy McGirt remained adamant that Hatton was past his best and insisted Malignaggi would beat him. Hatton did admit that if he was beaten he would retire. Hatton will retire if he fails to beat Malignaggi Telegraph The fight Michael Buffer introduced the fight on HBO World Championship Boxing and the referee was Kenny Bayless. Malignaggi started off the fight well, winning the first round by utilising his jab and getting a rhythm, However, in the second round a massive right by Hatton shook Malignaggi and he had to hold on for the rest of the round. From then on Hatton took control and won all the other rounds, with more big shots and combinations, until Malignaggi's trainer, Buddy McGirt threw in the towel in the 11th round. McGirt had warned Malignaggi that if he didn't do better in the next round he would pull him out and he stuck to his word. Hatton jumped up onto the ropes as Malignaggi furiously protested to, and pushed McGirt. However the final scores of 99-91 from all three judges proved that Malignaggi would not have been able to defeat Hatton on points in the remaining rounds. Aftermath It was always thought that if Hatton won he would have fought the winner of Manny Pacquiao vs. Oscar De La Hoya. When Manny Pacquiao defeated De La Hoya it was arranged that they will meet on May 2 in Las Vegas. Hatton was swiftly defeated. Malignaggi contemplated retirement but decided to fight on for money.

This act organized the Territory of Orleans as a judicial district and authorized one judgeship for the court. This was the only time the United States Congress provided a territory with a district court equal in its authority and jurisdiction to the district courts in the states. The district court in Orleans, not being assigned to a judicial circuit, was granted the same jurisdiction as United States circuit courts, except in appeals and writs of error, which were the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of the United States. Only one person - Dominic Augustin Hall - served as a judge on the court. Hall was nominated to the Court by President Thomas Jefferson on November 30, 1804, and was confirmed by the United States Senate on that date, receiving his commission on December 11, 1804. The court was abolished on April 8, 1812, by 2 Stat. 701, which organized the State of Louisiana as a judicial district.

In Canada consumer confidence is issued monthly by The Conference Board of Canada, an independent research organization, and is based telephone survey of 2,000 households.  Questions  The Index of Consumer Confidence survey is based on four attitudinal questions. Data is collected on each respondent's age, sex, marital status, occupation and geographic location of residence. The four questions are: # Considering everything, would you say that your family is better or worse off financially than six months ago? # Again, considering everything, do you think that your family will be better off, the same or worse off financially six months from now? # How do you feel the job situation and overall employment will be in this community six months from now? # Do you think that right now is a good or bad time for the average person to make a major outlay for items such as a home, car or other major item?  Methodology  The percentage of respondents who stated positive and negative opinions is calculated by question for each of the socio-economic and regional classifications as well as for the national aggregate. Positive opinions are beliefs that a consumer's financial situation improved over the past six months or will improve over the next six months, that more jobs will be available over the near term or that it is a good time to make a major purchase. Negative responses are defined as a worsening of a household's financial situation over the previous six months, expectations that the financial position or the number of jobs will worsen over the near term, as well as statements indicating that it is a bad time to make a major purchase. Each Index of Consumer Confidence is then derived by adding the percentage of positive responses, subtracting the percentage of negative responses, adding a scalar equal to 400 and indexing the resulting series to a base year of 2002. The scalar is introduced to force the value of the Index to zero if all responses are negative.

It is located near the Awali river, northeast of Sidon in southwestern Lebanon. The site was occupied from the 7th century BC to the 8th century AD, suggesting an integrated relationship with the nearby city of Sidon. Although originally constructed by Sidonian king Eshmunazar II in the Achaemenid era ( 529‚Äì333 BC) to celebrate the city's recovered wealth and stature, the temple complex was greatly expanded by Bodashtart, Yatan-milk and later monarchs. Because the continued expansion spanned many centuries of alternating independence and foreign hegemony, the sanctuary features a wealth of different architectural and decorative styles and influences. The sanctuary consists of an esplanade and a grand court limited by a huge limestone terrace wall that supports a monumental podium which was once topped by Eshmun's Graeco-Persian style marble temple. The sanctuary features a series of ritual ablution basins fed by canals channeling water from the Asclepius river (modern Awali) and from the sacred \\"Ydll\\" spring;The Phoenicians did not mark vowels at all until the Punics fitfully added a system of matres lectionis (vowel letters); for this reason the Phoenician inscription \\"Ydll\\" may be transcribed with a number of variant spellings (Yidlal, Yadlol etc.) Franz L. Benz (1982). Personal Names in the Phoenician and Punic Inscriptions. Pontificio Istituto Biblico. p199, . these installations were used for therapeutic and purificatory purposes that characterize the cult of Eshmun. The sanctuary site has yielded many artifacts of value, especially those inscribed with Phoenician texts, providing valuable insight into the site's history and that of ancient Sidon. The Eshmun Temple was improved during the early Roman Empire with a colonnade street, but declined after earthquakes and fell into oblivion as Christianity replaced polytheism and its large limestone blocks were used to build later structures. The temple site was rediscovered in 1900 by local treasure hunters who stirred the curiosity of international scholars. Maurice Dunand, a French archaeologist, thoroughly excavated the site from 1963 until the beginning of the Lebanese Civil War in 1975. After the end of the hostilities and the retreat of Israel from Southern Lebanon, the site was rehabilitated and inscribed to the World Heritage Site tentative list. Eshmun Eshmun was the Phoenician god of healing and renewal of life; he was one of the most important divinities of the Phoenician pantheon and the main male divinity of Sidon. Originally a nature divinity, and a god of spring vegetation, Eshmun was equated to Babylonian deity Tammuz. His role later expanded within the Phoenician pantheon, and he gained celestial and cosmic attributes. The myth of Eshmun was related by the sixth century Syrian Neoplatonist philosopher Damascius and ninth century Patriarch of Constantinople, Photius. They recount that Eshmun, a young man from Beirut, was hunting in the woods when Astarte saw him and was stricken by his beauty. She harassed him with her amorous pursuit until he emasculated himself with an axe and died. The grieving goddess revived Eshmun and transported him to the heavens where she made him into a god of heaven.in Damascius's Life of Isidore and Photius's Bibliotheca Codex 242 From a historical perspective, the first written mention of Eshmun goes back to 754 BC, the date of the signing of the treaty between Assyrian king Ashur-nirari V and Mati'el, king of Arpad; Eshmun figures in the text as a patron of the treaty. Eshmun was identified with Asclepius as a result of the Hellenic influence over Phoenicia; the earliest evidence of this equation is given by coins from Amrit and Acre from the third century BC. This fact is exemplified by the Hellenized names of the Awali river which was dubbed Asclepius fluvius, and the Eshmun Temple's surrounding groves, known as the groves of Asclepius. History The ashlar podium at the Eshmun temple, Bustan el-Sheikh (near Sidon) =Historical background= In the 9th century BC, the Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II conquered the Lebanon mountain range and its coastal cities. The new sovereigns exacted tribute from Sidon, along with every other Phoenician city. These payments stimulated Sidon's search for new means of provisioning and furthered Phoenician emigration and expansion, which peaked in the 8th century BC. When Assyrian king Sargon II died in 705 BC, the Sidonian king Luli joined with the Egyptians and Judah in an unsuccessful rebellion against Assyrian rule, but was forced to flee to Kition (modern Larnaca in Cyprus) with the arrival of the Assyrian army headed by Sennacherib, Sargon II's son and successor. Sennacherib instated Ittobaal on the throne of Sidon and reimposed the annual tribute. When Abdi-Milkutti ascended to Sidon's throne in 680 BC, he also rebelled against the Assyrians. In response, the Assyrian king Esarhaddon laid siege to the city. Abdi- Milkutti was captured and beheaded in 677 BC after a three-year siege, while his city was destroyed and renamed Kar-Ashur-aha-iddina (the harbor of Esarhaddon). Sidon was stripped of its territory, which was awarded to Baal I, the king of rival Tyre and loyal vassal to Esarhaddon. Baal I and Esarhaddon signed a treaty in 675 in which Eshmun's name features as one of the deities invoked as guarantors of the covenant.Eshmun's name is transcribed in Akkadian as \\"Ia-su-mu-nu\\" in the Esarhaddon treaty =Construction= Bull head protone from the temple of Eshmun. Sidon returned to its former level of prosperity while Tyre was besieged for 13 years (586‚Äì573 BC) by the Chaldean king Nebuchadnezzar II. Nevertheless, the Sidonian king was still held in exile at the court of Babylon. Sidon reclaimed its former standing as Phoenicia's chief city in the Achaemenid Empire (529‚Äì333 BC). During this period, Xerxes I awarded king Eshmunazar II with the Sharon plainTerritory south of Sidon from Mount Carmel to Jaffa for employing Sidon's fleet in his service during the Greco-Persian Wars. Eshmunazar II displayed his new-found wealth by constructing numerous temples to Sidonian divinities. Inscriptions found on the king's sarcophagus reveal that he and his mother, Amashtarte, built temples to the gods of Sidon, including the Temple of Eshmun by the \\"Ydll source near the cistern\\". As the Bodashtart inscriptions on the foundations of the monumental podium attest, construction of the sanctuary's podium did not begin until the reign of King Bodashtart. The first set of inscriptions bears the name of Bodashtart alone, while the second contains his name and that of the crown prince Yatan-milk. A Phoenician inscription, located upstream from the temple, that dates to the 14th year of Bodashtart's reign, alludes to water adduction works from the Awali river to the \\"Ydll\\" source that was used for ritual purification at the temple. =Roman era and Decline= The Eshmun sanctuary was damaged by an earthquake in the fourth century BC, which demolished the marble temple atop the podium; this structure was not rebuilt but many chapels and temples were later annexed at the base of the podium. The temple site remained a place of pilgrimage in the classical antiquity during the early Roman Empire and until the advent of Christianity, when the cult of Eshmun was banned during the Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire and a Christian church was built at the temple site across the Roman street from the podium. Remnants and mosaic floors of a Byzantine church can still be seen on the site. A Roman colonnade was built in the third century, probably by emperor Septimius Severus, and a Roman Villa showed a period of renewed relative importance for the city during the late period of Phoenicia under Roman rule. Furthermore, within the original Phoenician temple site the Romans added the processional stairway, the basins for ablutions and a nymphaeum with pictorial mosaics, that are still largely intact. Worn statuettes of three nymphs stand in the niches of a Roman fountain.Roman Eshmoun: Roman Colonnade, villa & stairway with nimphaeum Another earthquake hit Sidon around 570 AD; Antoninus of Piacenza, an Italian Christian pilgrim, described the city as partly in ruins. For many years after the disappearance of the cult of Eshmun, the sanctuary site was used as a quarry: Emir Fakhr-al-Din II, for example, used its massive blocks to build a bridge over the Awali river in the 17th century. The site later fell into oblivion until the 19th century =Modern discovery= Phoenician inscription of King Bodashtart found on the Eshmun Temple's podium.

When the French orientalist Ernest Renan visited the area in 1860, he noticed that the Awali bridge abutments were built of finely rusticated blocks that originated from an earlier structure. He also noted in his report, Mission de Ph√©nicie, that a local treasure hunter told him of a large edifice near the Awali bridge. In 1900, local clandestine treasure hunters digging at the Eshmun Temple site haphazardly discovered inscriptions carved onto the temple's walls. This discovery stirred the interest of Theodore Macridy, curator of the Museum of Constantinople, who cleared the temple remains between 1901 and 1903. Wilhelm Von Landau also excavated the site between 1903 and 1904. In 1920, Gaston Contenau headed a team of archaeologists who surveyed the temple complex. The first extensive archaeological excavation revealing the Eshmun Temple remains was undertaken by Maurice Dunand between 1963 and 1975. Archaeological evidence shows that the site was occupied from the seventh century BC to the eighth century AD. =After 1975= During the Lebanese Civil War and the Israeli occupation of South Lebanon (1985‚Äì2000), the temple site was neglected and was invaded by vegetation overgrowth; it was cleared and recovered its former condition after the Israeli withdrawal. Today the Eshmun sanctuary can be visited all year round and free of charge, it is accessible from an exit ramp off the main Southern Lebanon highway near Sidon's northern entrance. The site holds a particular archaeological importance since it is the best preserved Phoenician site in Lebanon; it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List's Cultural category on , 1996. In literature, the temple of Eshmun figures in Nabil Saleh's 2009 novel, The Curse of Ezekiel as the setting where Bomilcar falls in love and rescues princess Chiboulet from the evil design of one of the temple's priests. Location A number of ancient texts mention the Eshmun Temple and its location. The Phoenician inscriptions on the sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II, a Sidonian king,Discovered by the general consulate of France in Beirut Aim√© P√©r√©ti√© in 1855 in the Magharet Adloun necropolis, now on display in the Louvre commemorate the construction of a \\"house\\" for the \\"holy prince\\" Eshmun by the king and his mother, queen Amashtart, at the \\"Ydll source by the cistern\\". Dionysius Periegetes, an ancient Greek travel writer, identified the Eshmun temple by the Bostrenos River, and Antonin de Plaisance, a 6th-century AD Italian pilgrim recorded the shrine as near the river Asclepius fluvius.StraboIn Strabo's \\"Geographica\\" and other Sidonian sources describe the sanctuary and its surrounding \\"sacred forests\\" of Asclepius, the Hellenized name of Eshmun, in written texts. Located about south of Beirut and northeast of Sidon, the Eshmun Temple sits on the southern bank of the modern Awali river, previously referred to as Bostrenos or Asclepius fluvius in ancient text. Citrus groves, known as Bustan el-Sheikh (, the grove of the Sheikh), occupy the ancient \\"sacred forests\\" of Asclepius and are a favorite summer picnic location for locals. Architecture and description Spring flowers bloom near the base of a Babylonian-style column in Bustan el-Sheikh. Built under Babylonian rule (605‚Äì539 BC), the oldest monument at the site is a pyramidal building resembling a ziggurat that includes an access ramp to a water cistern. Fragments of marble column bases with Torus moldings and facetted columns found east of the podium are also attributed to the Babylonian era. The pyramidal structure was superimposed during Persian rule by a massive ashlar podium constructed from heavily bossed limestone blocks that measured more than across by thick, which were laid down in courses high. The podium stands high, runs into the hillside, and boasts a wide facade. The terrace atop of the podium was once covered by a Greco-Persian style marble temple probably built by Ionic artisans around 500 BC. The marble temple has been reduced to a few remaining stone fragments due to theft. During the Hellenistic period, the sanctuary was extended from the base of the podium across the valley. To the east base of the podium stands a large chapel, , dating to the 4th century BC. The chapel was adorned with a paved pool and a large stone \\"Throne of Astarte\\" carved of a single block of granite in the Egyptian style; it is flanked by two sphinx figures and surrounded by two lion sculptures. The throne, attributed to the Sidonian goddess Astarte, rests against the chapel wall, which is embellished by relief sculptures of hunting scenes. The once important Astarte basin lost its function during the 2nd century AD and was filled with earth and statue fragments. The west base contains another 4th-century BC chapel‚Äîcentered on a bull protome topped capital‚Äîthat remains preserved at the National Museum of Beirut. Widely known as the \\"Tribune of Eshmun\\" because of its shape, the altar of Eshmun is a white marble structure dating to the 4th century BC. It is long by wide and tall. Unearthed in 1963 by Maurice Dunand, it stands on a limestone socleplated with marble blocks that rest against a retaining wall. The altar is adorned with Hellenistic style relief sculptures and is framed by decorative moldings, one of which divides the altar into two distinct registers of symmetrical composition. The upper register portrays 18 Greek deities,The front register depicts from left to right: Eros, an unidentified matronly goddess who stands behind Artemis who is crowning an enthroned Leto. Apollo stands, playing a cithara next to Athena. Zeus appears next, enthroned with Hera standing by his side followed by standing figures of Amphitrite and Poseidon who stands at the right corner, his foot resting on a rock. On the right short side, turning the corner from Eros, the standing figures and the charioteer are identified as Demeter, Persephone and Helios. On the opposite short side, the three personages are assumed to be Dione, Aphrodite and Selene driving a quadriga. (from Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway's Fourth-century styles in Greek sculpture) including two charioteers surrounding the Greek god Apollo, who is depicted playing a cithara (a type of lyre). The lower register honors Dionysus, who leads his thiasos (his ecstatic revenue) in a dance to the music of pipe and cithara players. The Tribune is displayed at the National Museum of Beirut. Northeast of the site, another 3rd century BC temple stands adjacent to the Astarte chapel. Its fa√ßade is built with large limestone blocks and displays a two-register relief decoration illustrating a drunken revelry in honor of Dionysus, the Greek god of wine. Among the temple reliefs, one shows a man attempting to seize a large rooster which was the common sacrificial animal for Eshmun-Asclepius. The Eshmun Temple complex comprises an elaborate hydraulic installation channeling water from \\"Ydll\\" spring that is made up of an intricate system of water canals, a series of retaining basins, sacred ablution basins and paved pools. This system demonstrates the importance of ritual ablutions in Phoenician therapeutic cults. Later vestiges date from the Roman epoch and include a colonnaded road lined with shops. Of the large marble columns bordering the Roman street only fragments and bases remain. The Romans also built a monumental staircase adorned with mosaic patterns that leads to the top of the podium. To the right of the Roman road, near the entrance of the site stands a nymphaeum with niches where statues of the nymphs once stood. The floor of the nymphaeum is covered by a mosaic depicting the Maenads. Across the colonnaded road, facing the nymphaeum, are the ruins of a Roman villa; only the villa's courtyard has survived along with the remains of a mosaic depicting the four seasons. To the right of the processional Roman staircase stands a cubic altar, also of Roman construction. Other Roman period structures include two columns of a great portico leading to pools and other cultic installations. Function Eshmun's cult enjoyed a particular importance at Sidon as he was the chief deity after 500 BC. Aside from the extramural sanctuary at Bustan el-Sheikh, Eshmun also had a temple within the city. The extramural Eshmun Temple was associated with purification and healing; ritual lustral ablutions were performed in the sanctuary's sacred basins supplemented by running water from the Asclepius River and the \\"Ydll\\" spring water which was considered to have a sacred character and therapeutic quality. The healing attributions of Eshmun were combined with his divine consort Astarte's fertilizing powers; the latter had an annex chapel with a sacred paved pool within the Eshmun sanctuary. Pilgrims from all over the ancient world flocked to the Eshmun Temple leaving votive traces of their devotion and proof of their cure. There is evidence that from the 3rd century BC onwards there have been attempts to Hellenize the cult of Eshmun and to associate him with his Greek counterpart Asclepius, but the sanctuary retained its curative function. Artifacts and finds Votive marble head of a child found at the Eshmun Temple site; National Museum of Beirut collection, beginning of the 4th century BC Apart from the large decorative elements, carved friezes and mosaics which were left in situ, many artifacts were recovered and moved from the Eshmun Temple to the national museum, the Louvre or are in possession of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities. Some of these smaller finds include a collection of inscribed ostraca unearthed by Dunand providing rare examples of cursive Phoenician writing in the Phoenician mainland. One of the recovered ostracon bears the theophoric Phoenician name \\"grtnt\\" which suggests that veneration of the lunar-goddess Tanit occurred in Sidon.Antoine Vanel, Six \\"ostraca\\" ph√©niciens trouv√©s dans le temple d'Echmoun, pr√®s de Saida, in Bulletin du Mus√©e de Beyrouth, 20, (1967), p.53 A number of fragmented votive life-size sculptures of little children lying on their side and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among the best known of these is the Baalshillem Temple Boy, a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand. The boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem,The dedication reads: \\"This (is the) statue which Baalshillem son of King Ba'na, king of the Sidonians, son of King Abdamun, king of the Sidonians, son of King Baalshillem, king of the Sidonians, gave to his lord Eshmun at the \\"Ydll\\"-Spring. May he bless him\\" (taken from JCL Gibson's Textbook of Syrian Semitic inscriptions) the son of a Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy. These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice of the sick child. All of these sculptures represent boys. A limestone bust of a Kouros dating from the 6th century BC was found at the site, but unlike the archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare. Among the notable finds is a golden plaque showing a snake curling on a staff, a Hellenic symbol of Eshmun. and a granite altar bearing the name of Egyptian Pharaoh Achoris uncovered in the Eshmun sanctuary. This gift attests to the good relations between the Pharaoh and the kings of Sidon. The repute of the sanctuary was far reaching. Cypriot pilgrims from Paphos left marks of their devotion for Astarte on a marble stele inscribed both in Greek and Cypriot syllabary at Astarte's shrine; this stele is now in the custody of the Lebanese directorate general of antiquities. Pillaging Treasure hunters have sought out the Eshmun Temple since antiquity; around 1900 artifacts bearing Phoenician inscriptions from the temple site found their way to Beirutine antiquities markets where they stirred the interest of the Ottoman authorities and prompted a series of archeological digs. During the civil war, upon a request from then Lebanese director general of antiquities Maurice Chehab, Maurice Dunand moved more than 2000 artifacts from Sidon to a subterranean chamber at the Byblos crusader castle, north of Beirut. In 1981, the depot was looted and around 600 sculptures and architectural elements were stolen and smuggled out of Lebanon. Rolf Stucky, ex-director of the Institute of Classical Archeology of Basel affirmed during a conference in Beirut in the successful identification and return of eight sculptures to the Lebanese national museum.

History In 1926, a tornado cut through Charles County leaving many dead and injured. This event motivated the county leadership to establish a hospital to serve county residents. In 1939, 408 patients were served at the hospital. Today, the hospital has the capacity to serve 42,000 patients annually. In 2008, a major renovation and expansion of Civista Medical Center was completed, which doubled the size of the facility, and included new emergency department facilities. University of Maryland Medical System In July 2011, Civista Medical Center announced its affiliation as a member hospital of the University of Maryland Medical System (UMMS). On July 1, 2013, the Civista Medical Center began operating under the name University of Maryland Charles Regional Medical Center in the University of Maryland Medical System, becoming the first expansion of UMMS in the Washington, DC metropolitan area.

The episode was written by Cara DiPaolo and directed by Victor Nelli, Jr.ABC Medianet.com- Retrieved 03/02/09. Plot As the evening ends, just as Betty and Matt were about to kiss after Matt gives Betty a gift, it gets interrupted by Ignacio, who also interrupts a date by Hilda and Archie. At the same time Justin starts complaining about the camping trip he has to go on with Ignacio and Elena, which he finds boring. At work the following day, Daniel and Wilhelmina tell the staff that they are hoping that an issue of Mode devoted to sex will turn their fortunes around. But even as they discuss the article that they have to submit for the crucial issue, Betty gets quizzed by Amanda about Matt. Later that night, Matt seems a little shy about taking his romance with Betty to the next level. After they share a kiss and she indicates that maybe she will spend the night, he promptly shoves her into a cab. Betty leaves confused. At home, Hilda is dealing with the opposite: a man who is too nice to her. Betty explains why she is upset and Hilda doesn't understand it either. Upon hearing this, Amanda decides its time to use Betty as a guinea pig as blueprint for the issue as a way to get Matt's attention, so Marc and Amanda team up to give Betty a sexy makeover and to learn the art of seduction. But no matter what she does, Matt is uninterested, as evidenced by a stop at Betty's former apartment as they were planning to see a movie, when Matt sees Betty trying to be sexy and attempting to seduce him by telling him \\"What's your hurry soldier?\\" Unfortunately Matt leaves. The next day, Amanda and Marc lured Betty into following Matt and come upon a person whom he gives a hug, suggesting that he has another girl. But when Betty went to confront the two, Matt tells her that the woman, Helen, is his therapist. Matt is a sexaholic and uses meaningless, frequent sex as self-destructive behavior and is determined only to have sex when he's really committed and crazy about a girl. Of course, Betty's all freaked out by the idea that he has slept with hundreds of women (which has Betty hallucinating at the poetry slam that evening after she sees one hugging Matt and then sees every one of them wearing t-shirts with a number on them) and even wanted to be friends again, but Matt says that the only girl he wants in his life is Betty. In the end though, they handle it maturely and come to a meeting of minds by going up to his apartment. Now that Archie is dating Hilda, Hilda is starting to have issues about this romance because that she's not quite feeling it for him or maybe because he's just so nice to her. During a date at a diner and just as she's about to break up with him, a woman named Felissa shows up, fawning all over him and with good reason: she used to date Archie. That incident doesn't detour Hilda by inviting Archie back to the house, but when he suspects that she was only turned on when it seemed like another woman wanted him, he leaves immediately, even though she was just kidding. The next day, just as she was telling Betty about what happened, Felissa shows up and tells Hilda that she wants to have Archie back, leading to a confrontation that Archie walks into. In the end, Hilda says she still wants to try dating the nice guy, and after all, he has a thing for bad girls, as Archie explained to Hilda. They share another kiss, but Ignacio walks in on them. The issue could also be about Wilhelmina's dilemma, as she starts to have trouble sleeping when she starts dreaming about Connor and starts blaming the baby for keeping her up at night. At work, Marc, after witnessing his boss zoning out at her desk, tells her that it maybe her lack of sex that is causing her to have these nightmares. To fix the two situations at once, Marc hires James, a ripped former model who loves to sing lullabies, as her \\"Manny\\". Wilhelmina is not happy about what Marc did, but agrees to keep him around. Later that night, just as Wil breaks down and demands that he remove his pants and asks him to sleep with her, he shows her that he's not interested in sex just because of his looks and hands her a bit of wisdom, which Wilhelmina takes to heart before she fires him. She needs closure with Connor in order to focus on her baby. Finally, Daniel's issues with Molly seem to take on a message of their own, literally, when Molly invites him to a poetry slam. Daniel's intimates word to Molly has also doubled for her inspiration for her readings at the slam, this after Betty reads a text message that has Daniel getting freaked out when he realizes the poem she wants to read is a thinly veiled metaphor for their sex life, in which he's depicted crying. After being defiant and making changes to her poem, Daniel relents and lets her do the poem, which proves to be a resounding success. Later that night at his place, Daniel decided to give Molly a performance of his own by performing a song he wrote in high school that caused him untold mortification. Ratings This episode, its last before taking a break until a new episode aired on April 30, 2009, scored very highly and had many more viewers than the previous episode.

It is the only national park in Zanzibar. The Zanzibar red colobus, Procolobus kirkii (its population count is about 1000) found in the park, a rain forest species (unlike the black-and-white colobus found in other regions of Africa), is also known as Kirk's red colobus, named after Sir John Kirk, the British Resident of Zanzibar who had first brought it to the attention of zoological science.Inventory Acc.942 Papers of Sir John Kirk GCMB KCB and Lady Kirk n√©e Helen Cooke. National Library of Scotland: Manuscripts Division. It is now adopted as the flagship species for conservation in Zanzibar, from the mid-1990s. Other species of fauna found in the park are the Sykes monkey, bush babies, more than 50 species of butterfly and 40 species of birds. The nocturnal Zanzibar tree hyrax, which has four ‚Äòtoes‚Äô on its front feet and three on its back, is said to be the first hyrax species that has acclimatized to the forest. As part of the tourism circuit, the park attracts 10% of the over 100,000 visitors to Zanzibar every year. Wild life attractions of Zanzibar also include dolphins apart from deep sea fishing for tuna, marlin, and shark. Another animal in the forests of the Unguja Island unequaled elsewhere is the Zanzibar leopard (Panthera pardus adersi). In the local legend, this reportedly extinct species, has been given a mythical status and is called 'Chui' and is part of the superstitious beliefs of the people. People believe that sorcerers keep this animal as their pet and scare people by spinning stories that the animal appears like spirits and disappears into thin air. It was last reported in 1999 and officials, and men working on the ‚Äúcoral rag‚Äù lands of the southern and eastern Ungula Island are assertive that the species is not extinct, though it has not been sighted since 2003. The last sighting reported in 2002-2003 was of two leopards. Photographs of live examples of the species are not known to exist, although a stuffed example is a museum display in Zanzibar Museum, and a few skins exist in museums in London and Massachusetts. Trail camera footage from a 2018 American documentary television series does appear to have captured proof of the leopard's existence and will undoubtedly spark renewed interest and further protective enforcements. A smaller leopard with spots, which is a biological product of the larger animal, is seen now in the island. The sea grass beds of the Chwaka Bay, fringed with mangrove forests, are important breeding grounds for marine organisms, including open sea fish species. The mangroves are also good breeding grounds for birds. An Integrated Conservation and Development (ICD) planning for the area is under consideration. The bay is also proposed to be declared a Ramsar Site and is placed on the Tanzanian Tentative List for World Heritage Sites to recognize its unique natural and cultural assets with due consideration of proposed conservation efforts. Ecology According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, the park site occupies \\"the largest remaining stand of near-natural forest on Zanzibar.\\" The forest rests upon a reef limestone marine terrace. Habitats within the park and associated protected lands include a groundwater forest, coastal forest, and grassland, with mangroves and salt marsh at the coast. The vegetation types found within the park once existed throughout Zanzibar. Endangered animals that reside within the park include: *the Zanzibar red colobus (Piliocolobus kirkii), an endemic monkey species that exists only in Zanzibar. *the Aders' duiker (Cephalophus adersi) *the Zanzibar servaline genet (Genetta servalina archeri) Ecotourism CARE International sponsored a development project for the wilderness area and surrounding communities from 1995 until 2003. A revenue sharing program from park entrance fees has been used to construct schools and health clinics for local villages.

It served as research vessel, fishing vessel and is now a yacht. HistoryResearch vessel= The vessel was commissioned in 1928 by MIR (Polish Fishing Institute). It was built in 1928 to order of in the Andersen Shipyard in Frederikssunde, Denmark. It was christened Ewa, inspired by the names of daughters of both Professor Micha≈Ç Siedlecki and Dr Franciszek Lubecki, two distinguished scientists and maritime researches pioneers.Micinski Jerzy, Polish Special and Auxiliary Vessels 1920 - 1939, in the serie Gdansk Maritime Museums Proceedings Vol. II, Wydawnictwo Morskie Gdyni, Gdansk 1967. p. 168. MIR owned another vessel that was almost the same: a few months earlier they acquired another cutter Starnia, which was also used for finding new fishing grounds and fisherman‚Äôs training. Both vessels played an important role in the development of the sea fishery industry in Poland. The classical hull of the cutter, with straight bow and spoon shaped stern, was built from oak. The ship was built as a sailing vessel with an auxiliary motor. The propulsion system was composed of a two-cylinder Tuxham engine of 64-76 hp and ketch rigged gaff sails. The GRT was 29 ton and the NRT was 10 ton. The total area of the four sails was 160 m2. Under deck there was space for a crew of five, four scientists and laboratory. When already in use as research vessel, a wheel house was built on the aft deck. The cutter was commanded by Jan Lemke until 1936. In that time Ewa sailed the Baltic and was used for research expeditions organized by scientists form MIR, The Department of Economy and Organization of Fishery in Bydgoszcz, The Sea Fishery Laboratory form Hel and departments of the Scientists Laboratory of Farming from Pu≈Çawy. In 1932 those institutions were united in the maritime base in Hel, which was also the home harbour or Norda at that time. Those expeditions contributed to recognition of fishing grounds at the Baltic Sea and development of polish sea biology and ichthyology. After six years of intensive exploitation Ewa had to be renovated. In 1939, during inspection at the Fishery Shipyard in Gdynia, it was ascertained that the hull had been seriously damaged (rotten) and the cutter was qualified to be destroyed. At that time Antoni Budzisz from Gdynia became interested in her. He bought the cutter from MIR and adapted her as a fishing boat. Ewa was being overhauled and the damaged parts of the hull were exchanged. =The German occupation during World War II= The overhaul was unfortunately interrupted by the Second World War, but later it continued and it was finally completed in 1942. The overhaul was done in such way that the masts were cut and a more powerful motor was the only power source. The cutter, at that time named Putzig 2, was used as fishing boat with the base port in W≈Çadys≈Çawowo. Leon Budzisz was her captain. Leon was a cousin of Antoni Budzisz, who died during the war. According to Mr Jerzy Budzisz, son of Leon Budzisz, the vessel was called Anne Marie between 1941 and 1945.Interview by with Mr Jerzy Budzisz by Philippe De Brouwer. On March 3, 1945 the cutter was confiscated and used by a group of Germans to escape from Hel to K√∂ln. The around 100 persons that escaped with Putzig-2 were mainly soldiers and postmen.Interview by with Mr Jerzy Budzisz by Philippe De Brouwer, and the daily Dziennik Ba≈Çtycki, December 9, 1994. =The swan-dance in Communist Poland= In 1946, she was traced down and brought back Gdynia. The General Sea Fishery Inspectorate assigned former Ewa to The Community ‚ÄúRybak‚Äù, and she was renamed to W≈Ça ‚Äì 17. Leon Budzisz became once more her captain. After Community was closed down this same Leon Budzisz bought the cutter, and used it as a fishing boat till 1955 when he had to sell her due to financial problems.the daily Dziennik Baltycki, December 9, 1994 The cutter was bought by The Community ‚ÄúGryf‚Äù. In 1958 the next overhaul had to be made. At that time the cutter was already deprived of sailing equipment and the spoon shaped overhang on the stern. Till half of the 1980s the boat, renamed to Zag-9, was being exploited by two individual ship-owners. The base port was Gda≈Ñsk, G√≥rki Zachodnie. Later they decided that it was not worth it to make another repair of the hull. =Rebirth and new life= On July 1, 1986 the old cutter was bought from the fishermen Zygmunt Krukowski and Krzystof Klarwacki by Stanislaw Konopka,.Sale contract of July 1, 1986. Contract registered on July 7, 1986 Later he would start the rebuild together with Grzegorz Wozniak, who is geographer by the profession and sailor by passion and the owner of tourist office ‚ÄúNord‚Äù. The price was 15'000 old Polish Zloty; this is now (due to the high inflation that followed) about the price of one bread. The new ship-owner decided to rebuild the cutter as a sailing yacht so the boat was towed to Puck, where it was put out of the water and moved to the fishing harbor. In 1986 the hull and the used-out motor were dismantled. From the original vessel only the backbone, ribs and planks from underwater part were left. After that the hull was rebuilt in a slightly changed shape. The boards were made two planks higher along the side of the hull and four planks higher at the stern. Under the wooden backbone (keel) a six meter long, a I-shaped steel ballast beam was fixed. In 1990 the newly rebuilt hull was transported to Jastarnia were the reconstruction of the yacht was meant to be finished. Unfortunately the construction company did not fulfill the contract. The hull was this time transported to Gdynia and placed on the embankment of Yacht Club ‚ÄúStal‚Äù from which the shipowner was a member. The last stage of the reconstruction lasted until October 1994. The interior was finished by boat builder Leszek Fryzkowski supported by the ship owner Grzegorz Wo≈∫niak. The sailing plan has been designed by Jan M≈Çynarczyk and consists of two glued spruce masts ‚Äì 19.5 m main mast with wishbone boom and 17.5 bezan mast, and five sails with total area of 160 sq m . The masts were made by the boat builder Franciszek Lewi≈Ñski. Under the deck there are a technical forecastle (with chain locker, diesel and storage), three berths for 3 persons, heads, a shower/wet gear room, a quite a big saloon with, a galley, a navigation cabin, an engine room and 3 berths for the crew. The yacht is equipped 110 hp Delfin motor built in 1978.See the Yacht Machinery Certificate Nbr. 2/TJ/95 (Gdansk, 11-04-1995). The nine-year effort resulted in a two-masted, classical yacht, which was named Norda (the word for the onerous, north winds in the local Kaszubian language). The length of the ketch including bowsprit was then 19.5 m. The vessels gained her first certificate still as Zag-9.Safety card (karta bezpieczienstwa) number 2/85 valid till January 4, 1985, emitted by the Polish Sea Authorities (UrzƒÖd Morski). The document does not mention a name, but mentions the fishing sign only. On March 3, 1987 the newly rebuild yacht got its name Norda.Decision of the Polish Yacht Association if 3 III 1987, Nbr. PZ - 75/87. From this document we also learn that the owner is maszoperia S. Konopka, G. Wo≈∫niak (maszoperia is something like fishing team - see :pl:Maszoperia). This means actually not that Norda was really used for fishing, but rather that it was co-owned by two persons. In 1995, Grzegorz Wozniak became the sole owner of the yacht,Contract of 19 December 1995, changes made on the Certificate of Registry of 7 February 1994 on 29 February 1996. and in 2002 he changed the registration to motorsailer, as this had less strict regulations for the crew compared to a sailing vessel.Confirmation of the Polish Shipping Register, letter Nbr. SJ/Sc/631545/53/2002. The safety card of 2004, mentions only one owner: Grzegorz Wo≈∫niak, and another home harbour: Gdynia.Safety Card number 459/GDY/2004, emitted by the Polish Sea Authorities. Norda was sold on December 31, 2004 to Philippe De Brouwer.Notarial deed who continued to restore Norda with original pieces: equipped both the mast-foots with pinrails, added some antique details to the interior, and even installed central heating and a woodstove. Smaller changes and repairs also resulted in a longer bowsprit. The LOA is now 20.5m, and Norda is again sailing the Baltic Sea, visiting many of the places where it sailed about 80 years ago and that it did not visit ever since.Norda visited for example in 2005 Tallinn, Stockholm, and Visby; in 2006 Karlskorina, Germany, Kopenhagen, and Helsingor. Many of those ports were not visited by Norda since its active period in the 1930s. =Today and future= At the end of 2014, G.Weston and A.Graf, co-founders of WestOnBoats, became Norda's owners. Construction Norda is a wooden sailing cutter built in Denmark in 1928. It is a construction with double ribs, and with 2 inch molded wooden planks on the outside. The complete hull structure, the underwater planking as well as part of the deck constructions are still original. Only a steel keel is added under the wooden keel, to provide more counterweight in order to add higher masts and more sail.

Slater became the BBC's first female Director of Sport in April 2009. Previous to this, she had been the BBC's Head of Production and Head of General Sports for a number of years. Biography Slater was born into a sporting family: her father, Bill, was a professional footballer who played for England, won the Footballer of the Year award in 1960, and won three Football League titles with Wolverhampton Wanderers. Her uncle, J J Warr, played for the England cricket team. Slater gained two degrees, at the universities of Birmingham and Oxford, before qualifying to be a PE teacher at Loughborough. Slater appeared in the gymnastics competition at the 1976 Summer Olympics, carrying the British flag at the opening ceremony, and eventually earned 20 caps as an international gymnast. As a gymnast, she finished runner-up in the British Championships in the same year as her appearance at the Olympics. In other sporting achievements, she reached national standard at diving and was a club- level squash player. Slater was first employed by the BBC in 1983, when she became a trainee Assistant Producer. She had previous experience in the TV industry starring in the 1978 BBC children's thriller series Out of Bounds, before working for ATV Sport, a company run by her father's colleague Billy Wright. In 1984, she joined the BBC's sports division as an Assistant Producer. Slater worked her way up the corporation's hierarchy as a Producer, Senior Producer, and Executive Producer. She eventually became head of sports production, and helped produce programmes for events such as The Open and Masters golf, the Commonwealth Games, the Grand National, Ascot and the Derby. In 2009, it was announced that she would become director of sport, taking over from Roger Mosey, and becoming the first woman to hold the position. Mosey became the BBC Director of London 2012. Slater has overseen the department's relocation to Salford (BBC Sport is one of five departments that has been moved from London to Salford), as well as the 2012 Summer Olympics, held in London. She has also presided over events such as the 2010 World Cup and 2010 Winter Olympics. Barbara also, in 2013 won back the broadcasting rights of the FA Cup, in a major coup, ensuring live first-class football was available to licence fee payers. Speaking of her appointment, she said \\"I am thrilled to have this opportunity to lead BBC Sport at such an exciting and challenging time, that includes leading the division to its new home at the heart of BBC North and also ensuring BBC Sport plays its part in making the 2012 Games the success they deserve to be.\\" During her time as Director of Sport though Slater has overseen the loss of many exclusive BBC Sport deals most notably that of full-time Formula One coverage from free to air broadcasting to a shared arrangement with Sky Sports lasting 2012 to 2015 with the BBC showing half the races live and the rest with highlights. The deal allowed Sky Sports to show every race live. Further scrutiny was shown with the BBC portion of a 2012-2018 deal being sold to Channel 4 for the 2016 to 2018 seasons to make savings. This is in addition the Grand National which saw Channel 4 gain the rights in March 2012; further dilution of the BBC sports portfolio (together with the loss of advert-free coverage) was announced by Barbara Slater in the guise of a sharing arrangement with ITV; and in September 2015 she announced the imminent loss of yet more live coverage, this time of The Open Championship. Honours Following the BBC's successful broadcast of the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the biggest television event in British broadcasting history, Slater was awarded the Inspirational Woman prize at the Women in Film & TV Award that year. Slater was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to sports broadcasting.

Its last assignment was with the Western Air Defense Force, based at Hamilton Air Force Base, California. It was inactivated on 8 June 1951.This is after WW2. HistoryWorld War II= Activated on 1 January 1941 as one of the three squadrons assigned to the 32nd Pursuit Group as part of the United States buildup of forces after the eruption of World War II. The squadron was equipped with Curtiss P-36A Hawks and Boeing P-26A Peashooters drawn from the 16th and 37th Pursuit Groups. After being formed at Albrook Field, Panama Canal Zone, the squadron was moved to R√≠o Hato Army Air Base, Panama. Following its stay at Rio Hato, the unit was ordered to France Field on 1 January 1942, and the squadron was equipped with Bell P-39 Airacobras. In early 1942, the Squadron was actively engaged in anti-submarine patrols, for which duty the aircraft were each armed with a 350 pound depth charge. Either 75-foot or 150-foot hydrostatic fuses were used, but, in every case, these were always dropped prior to returning to base. On 12 May 1942, \\"C\\" Flight of the Squadron was sent to Seymour Island Airfield in the Galapagos Islands (just before the unit was redesignated as the 52nd Fighter Squadron on 15 May 1942), becoming one of the first fighter detachments stationed there, although the main squadron remained at France Field. The Galapagos Detachment was redesignated as \\"E\\" Flight on 31 October. The detachment's stay on the Galapagos lasted until 1 December 1942. By 18 January 1943, the 52nd was at France Field. However, by 16 June, detachments were located at Rio Hato Army Air Base, Corozal (Canal Zone) and David Field, Panama, with Squadron Headquarters at France Field. The unit ended its assignment to France Field on 23 March 1944 and, with the gradual wind-down of Sixth Air Force, was one of the units slated to be disbanded. The unit was subsequently disbanded on 25 May 1944.

It is the origin of the Anglicised name Griffith[s], and was historically sometimes treated as interchangeable with the etymologically unrelated Germanic name Galfrid (Latinised as Galfridus). The Welsh form evolved from the Common Brittonic Grippiud or Gripuid.Morgan, T.J., Welsh Surnames, Qualitex Printing Limited, Cardiff, 1985, The Orthography of Welsh Surnames 5-8, Gruffydd pgs 103‚Äì105, first element gruff as a noun means 'magic wand' and second element iudd as a noun means 'lord', found on page 160 entry for Maredudd Evolution and history One of the oldest forms which gave rise all other variations is Grippiud or Gripuid, which evolved into Old Welsh Griffudd. The second element of the name, iudd, as a noun has a meaning of 'lord' and is found in other Welsh names such as Meredith (Mared[i]udd) and Bleidd[i]udd. In North Wales Griffudd evolved into Gruffudd. ‚ÄúWhen u came to have the same quality as the clear y (the y of monosyllables and final syllables) the name generally became Gruffydd, and this is now regarded as the standard form,‚Äù according to T.J. Morgan and Prys Morgan . Gruffudd of Old Welsh became spelt as Gruffydd in Middle Welsh and Modern Welsh of today. The high central vowel sound of u/y was lost entirely in South Wales and replaced by the i sound, and the form Griffidd became standard in the south, the region to first be encountered by Anglo-Norman scribes. Variations Anglo-Norman scribes rendered Griffidd and Gruffydd as Griffith, with both Gruffydd and Griffith becoming the standardized forms for the same name since the High Middle Ages and into the modern era. The form of the name encountered in Latin texts is Griffith, Griffini and Gruffin. Many variations have evolved since the Middle Ages and Tudor period, with many springing from abbreviated forms such as Griff. Griffri, Griffith, Griffyn, Griffei, Griffies, Griffitte, Griffits, Griffitts, Griffes, Griffyths, Gripthis, Gripphes, Griffithi, Griffen, Griffee, Griffey, Gruffudd, Gruffydd Patronymics evolving from Griffith include Griffiths and Griffyths, son of Griffith. Hypocoristic forms Hypocoristic forms, or ‚Äúpet names‚Äù, included Guto, Gutyn, Gitto, Getyn, Gitton, and Gutta, with many of these becoming surnames themselves. Derivations of Gruffydd by way of Guto/Gitto include Gittos, Gittose, Gittoss, Gittas, Gyttes, Gitts, Gytts, Gittus, Gitthouse, Gyttors, Gittonce, Gittal, Gittall, Gyttall, Gittall, Gethyn. The name Gatehouse may have originated in some parts of Wales and the March from Gittose or a variant as a conscious effort to further anglicize the name.

Karas himself claims to have gambled with more money in casinos than anyone else in history and has often been compared to Nick the Greek, another high-stakes gambler of Greek origin.  Early life  Karas was born on November 1, 1950 in Antypata on the island of Cephalonia, Greece. He grew up in poverty and had to shoot marbles as a teenager to avoid going hungry. His father, Nickolas, was a construction worker who struggled financially. Karas ran away from home at the age of 15 after, in a rage, his father threw a shovel at him, barely missing his head. He never saw his father again. Nickolas died four years later. Karas worked as a waiter on a ship, making $60 a month until the ship arrived at Portland, Oregon. He would later move to Los Angeles, where he would gamble his bankroll up to $2,000,000 before losing it playing high-stakes poker. Gambling career He worked at a Los Angeles restaurant, which was next to a bowling alley and a pool hall. There he honed his pool skills and eventually made more money playing pool than he did as a waiter. When his victims from the pool hall thinned out, he went to Los Angeles card rooms to play poker. Karas claims to have gone from broke to millionaire and back several times. Later, he became an astute poker player, building his bankroll to over $2,000,000. Professional poker players such as Chip Reese and Doyle Brunson, had played and considered Karas a weaker poker player often giving Karas handicaps to play. In December 1992, Karas had lost all but $50 playing high-stakes poker. Instead of reevaluating his situation and slowing down, he decided to go to Las Vegas in search of bigger games. The next three years would go down in legend as the greatest run in casino gambling history. =The Run= Karas' initial run lasted for six months when he drove to Las Vegas with $50 and turned a $10,000 loan into approximately $17 million playing poker and pool. In December 1992, after losing his entire bankroll, Karas drove to Vegas with his car and $50 in his wallet. After arriving at The Mirage, Karas recognized a fellow poker player from the Los Angeles scene and convinced him for a $10,000 loan. Karas quickly turned the loan into $30,000 playing $200/$400 limit Razz. Karas returned $20,000 to his backer, who was more than content. With a little over $10,000 in his pocket, Karas went to a bar with a pool table adjacent from the Liberace Plaza on East Tropicana. There he found a wealthy and respected poker and pool player. Karas refused to reveal his name for the sake of his opponent's reputation; he simply referred to him as \\"Mr. X\\". They started playing 9-ball pool at $5,000 a game raising the stakes as games progressed. After Karas won several hundred thousand dollars, they raised the stakes to $40,000 a game. Many gamblers and professional poker players watched Archie play with stakes never seen before. Karas ended up winning $1,200,000. The two decided to play poker at Binion's Horseshoe where Karas won an additional $3,000,000 from Mr. X. Karas was willing to gamble everything he made and continued to raise the stakes to a level few dared to play at. With a bankroll of $4 million, Karas gambled his bankroll up to $7 million after spending only three months in Vegas. By now, many poker players had heard of Mr. X's losses to Archie. Only the best players dared to challenge him. Karas sat at the Binion's Horseshoe's poker table with 5 of his 7 million dollars in front of him, waiting for any players willing to play for such stakes. The first challenger was Stu Ungar, a three-time World Series of Poker champion widely regarded as one of the greatest Texas hold'em and gin rummy player of all time. Stu was backed by Lyle Berman, another professional poker player and business executive who co-founded Grand Casinos. Karas first beat Stu for $500,000 playing heads-up Razz. Karas then played Ungar in 7-card stud, which cost Ungar an additional $700,000. The next player was Chip Reese, widely regarded as the greatest cash game player. Reese claims that Karas beat him for more money than anyone else he ever played. After 25 games, Reese was down $2,022,000 playing $8,000/$16,000 limit. Karas continued to beat many top players, from Puggy Pearson to Johnny Moss. Many top players would not play him simply because his stakes were too high. The only player to beat Karas in the first round during his run was Johnny Chan, who beat him for $900,000, though Chan did lose to Karas frequently, before and after the streak. By the end of his six-month-long winning streak, Karas had amassed more than $17 million. Karas said that Doyle Brunson was the only player able to win playing Razz during his winning streak. The poker action for Karas mostly dried up due to his reputation and stakes. He turned to dice, for $100,000 per roll. Karas was allowed to make pass line and come bets of up to $300,000, but with no odds. Jack Binion capped Karas' buy bets on the 4 and 10 at $100,000. At one point, Binion raised Karas' 4 and 10 buy bet limit to $200,000. Karas quickly won $920,000 under these conditions; then Binion immediately lowered the limit back to $100,000. Karas said that he could quickly win $3 million on dice, while it would take days to weeks with poker. Karas stated, \\"with each play I was making million-dollar decisions, I would have played even higher if they'd let me.\\" Transporting money became a hassle for Karas, as he had several million dollars in his car every day. He carried a gun with him at all times and would often have his brother and casino security guards escort him. At one point, Karas had won all of the Binion's casino's $5000 chips, the highest denomination at the time. By the end of his winning streak, he had won over $40 million. Downfall Karas's odds-defying two-and-a-half-year streak came to an end in 1995 when he lost most of his money in a period of three weeks. He lost $11 million playing dice and then lost the $2 million he won from Chip Reese back to him. Following these losses, he switched to baccarat and lost another $17 million, for a total of $30 million. With approximately $12 million left and needing a break from gambling, he returned to Greece. When he came back to Las Vegas, he went back to the Horseshoe, shooting dice and playing baccarat at $300,000 per bet, and in less than a month, lost all but his last million. With his last million, he went to the Bicycle Club and played Johnny Chan in a $1,000,000 freezeout match. This time, Chan was backed by Lyle Berman, and they took turns playing Karas. He preferred playing both of them, instead of just Chan, as he felt Chan was the tougher opponent. Karas won and doubled his money, only to lose it all at dice and baccarat, betting at the highest limits, in just a few days. Mini-streaks Since he lost his $40 million, he has gone on a few smaller streaks. Less than a year later, he turned $40,000 into $1,000,000 at the Desert Inn. He then went back to the Horseshoe and won an additional $4 million before losing it all the next day. A few years later, Karas went on another streak at the Gold Strike Casino, 32 miles outside Las Vegas. He went with $1,800 and lost $1,600 until he was down to just $200. Then after getting something to eat, he decided to gamble the rest of it. He shot dice and ran his $200 into $9,700 and then headed to Las Vegas. He stopped at Fitzgeralds Casino & Hotel and won another $36,000, betting $1,000 with $2,000 odds. He went back to Binion's and won another $300,000 at the Horseshoe and by the third day, had won a total of $980,000 from a low of $200. Personal life Karas currently resides in Las Vegas. His family lives in Greece. Karas stays in touch with his family by phone, and tries to travel back to Greece at least once per year. He brought his mother, Mariana, to Las Vegas for six-month visits when he was on his winning streak. Karas's story was documented in Cigar Aficionado by American author Michael Konik and also was featured, along with Stu Ungar, in an E! documentary special called THS Investigates: Vegas Winners & Losers. Konik also wrote an article about Karas which was featured in a book about Las Vegas gamblers called The Man With the $100,000 Breasts. He was interviewed, along with poker player Tony G, by Tiffany Michelle during the 2008 World Series of Poker. He was also a featured player on ESPN's coverage of the 2008 WSOP. =Cheating= Karas was arrested on September 24, 2013 after being caught marking cards at a San Diego casino's blackjack table by the Barona Gaming Commission. He was arrested at his Las Vegas home and extradited to San Diego to face charges of burglary, winning by fraudulent means and cheating. He was found guilty and sentenced to three years probation.

He later became a farmer specialising in award-winning rare breeds of sheep.Motor-Cycle News page 10 Thursday 28 November 2019 Bauer Consumer Media ISSN 0027-1853 National Service Tait gained useful knowledge of motorcycle handling during his National Service, when he was a member of the Royal Corps of Signals White Helmets Motorcycle Display Team. Motorcycle career Tait joined Triumph at the age of 21 in 1950 on the assembly line but was soon promoted to the Experimental Department and was encouraged to go road racing by his manager Frank Baker. Tait joined the Triumph works team and worked under Doug Hele on Triumph's chassis development programme through the early 1960s. He became the main test rider for the development of the three cylinder motorcycles which meant clocking up high mileages in all weathers and grueling sessions at MIRA and in wind tunnels. Triumph engineer Brian Jones was watching the Thruxton 500 endurance race for production motorcycles and saw Tait come into the pits after an hour on the track and plunge his blistered hands into a bucket of water. Following this Jones worked with Hele on improvements to the chassis which resulted in an Isle of Man TT victory. Testing could also be dangerous work and he broke his collarbone when he was thrown off a prototype Triumph when the gearbox seized at the 1968 Isle of Man TT. Racing career In the 1969 Belgian Grand Prix, on the Spa-Francorchamps racetrack in the Ardennes, Tait was riding Triumph's entry for the 500 cc race ‚Äì a version of the Triumph Daytona developed by Doug Hele. Tait travelled with the mechanics Arthur Jakeman and Jack Shemans in an old Ford Transit van, in which the three of them also had to sleep. He led the world champion Giacomo Agostini for three laps to finish second to the MV Agusta at an average speed of 116 mph. Also in 1969, he teamed with Malcolm Uphill to win the Thruxton 500 endurance race. 'Slippery Sam' was one of three similar motorcycles Triumph built for the 1970 Production TT, one of which, ridden by Malcolm Uphill, won the race at 97.71 mph. The Slippery Sam name was acquired during the 1970 Bol d'Or 24 Hour Race in France when a faulty oil pump covered Tait with engine oil. In 1971 Tait and Ray Pickrell won the Bol d'Or 24-hour endurance race on a Triumph triple. Tait was hired by Suzuki in 1976 to help develop their 500 cc Grand Prix bike for Barry Sheene. In 1976, Tait won the 750 class at the North West 200 race. He continued racing two-strokes and 'Slippery Sam' in his late forties but gave up racing after a serious crash on the 'Son of Sam' production racer in the 1976 Production TT. Motor trade business Tait set up a successful Suzuki dealership business after the Meriden factory closed until 2002. Sheep farming Tait went on to become a champion sheep breeder, winning England's Royal Show, the Royal Welsh Show and Scotland's Royal Highland Show with his Blue Demaine and champion Rouge Shearling ewes. His Worcestershire farm is home to the Knighton Flock.

History A grammar school has existed in Ramsey since 1681. It moved to Lezayre Road in 1933 and was housed in a building that now forms the east building of the present school. It was decommissioned and requisitioned by the military during the Second World War from 1940 to 1946. In 1946 Ramsey Grammar School was re-opened as a non- selective mixed comprehensive school. It was the first full comprehensive school in the British Isles with 460 pupils on its register. The school now has over 1,000 pupils with 140 teaching and support staff. The site It has three buildings, the East building, West building and South building, the West and South buildings being connected by a two-level corridor. While the South building was being built, a North building, formerly Auldyn Infants School, was temporarily employed to house pupils that were previously in the South wing of the West building. The South building being opened on 24 October 2007, the North building was demolished, making way for the new junior school for Ramsey, Scoill Ree Gorree. The South building which cost ¬£6.5 million opened in September 2007. It houses the Special Needs, Design and Technology departments. There is an open-plan Art studio, Drama studios, a suite of new English rooms and space for Economics, Business, Politics, Rural and Agricultural Science complete with a teaching piggery with room for 14 piglets. The Sixth Form Centre includes a 122-seat Lecture Theatre. Elsewhere there is a modern Sports Hall recently re-roofed and significantly modernised and a Science Block. The all-weather floodlit astroturf pitch was completely resurfaced in 2011. Every classroom is networked giving every student and teacher intranet with disk space and controlled internet access and email from every computer. Classrooms each have an electronic smartboard with sound. Students The Isle of Man does not have specialist schools, league tables, SATs or the Academy initiatives current in England.

Ramsey Grammar School with, presently, 962 students on roll including a Sixth Form of 184. The Flexible Learning Area is designed for SEBD, MLD, SLD and PMLD students and those requiring Nurture provision. There have been an average of 60% + 5 A*- C with English and Maths passes over the past three years. Wartime use Requisitioned by the Air Ministry the school became the Operations Room for the fighter station at RAF Andreas when the station became operational in 1941.Ramsey Courier, Friday, October 19, 1945; Page: 3 During that time information concerning all enemy aircraft flying in the area of the Irish Sea was processed by the Operations Room with aircraft being plotted on a large map, it then being the duty of the Operations Controller to task such fighters as was necessary to intercept; the Operations Room being particularly busy during raids on Liverpool, Glasgow and Belfast. With the resulting strategic shift of the Luftwaffe following the German Invasion of Russia (Operation Barbarossa) RAF Andreas became a training station and the Operations Room in turn became redundant. However, with the multitude of RAF Stations situated around the Irish Sea area, considerable difficulty began to be experienced concerning the controlling of the various aircraft which were undertaking the training of numerous navigators, air gunners, bomb aimers and wireless operators. The training sorties took the pupils over the sea, and it was considered necessary to set up an organisation which would be able to maintain radio contact with the aircraft at any stage of their exercises, in order to pass meteorological conditions and instructions necessary to their safety. In March 1943 a unit known as the Training Flying Control Centre (TFCC) was formed for this purpose being headed by Wing Commander Bullimore. The TFCC at Ramsey was the only organisation of its type in the whole Royal Air Force, and its layout was peculiar to the work it was required to carry out. The officers responsible for the setting up of the operation had no previous experience or pattern to guide them, except such experience as had been gained in the Operation Control Rooms of Fighter Command. The operations of such however had relied on the co-operation from the Observer Corps and RADAR information from which was used to plot the positions of friendly and hostile aircraft alike, and although this was satisfactory for the purpose intended it was entirely inapplicable to the problems which faced the creators of the TFCC. During the peak period of operations, the Station was responsible for the safety of training aircraft from ten separate stations, and it was not uncommon for the Controller and his duty watch of Women's Auxiliary Air Force (WAAFs) and airmen to be responsible for the safety of over 200 aircraft flying at the same time, each carrying an average crew of five. The system of control was highly technical; the Operations Room being divided into three parts: * Signals Interception Room. This was staffed by WAAFs who would listen out for all signals passed between aircraft for which the Station was responsible. * Navigation Room. This is where the positions of the aircraft were mapped out using the bearing which had been intercepted by the wireless operators. * Operations Room. This is where the information gathered would be plotted on the large plotting table. The Operations Room could therefore be described as the main source of information regarding any form of aircraft distress in any part of the Western and Northwestern seaboards of the British Isles. The Controller was responsible for informing the various air sea and mountain rescue services and for generally collecting and passing on all information to the different parties concerned. Due to the mountainous character of the Isle of Man together with its often challenging meteorological conditions it became apparent that additional aids to assist aircraft in distress were necessary. A ring of large searchlights were positioned around the Island for the purpose of directing aircraft away from high ground and towards the Island's three air bases\\\\- RAF Andreas, RAF Jurby and RNAS Ronaldsway. One such example of the efficiency of the operation was demonstrated during an incident in the winter of 1944. On that occasion a Vickers Wellington bomber was forced to ditch in the sea off Maughold Head and the SOS was intercepted at Ramsey. Within a matter of minutes the Coastguard had been alerted and distress signals were spotted off Maughold Head. In turn the air sea rescue launch was scrambled from Ramsey and the coastguard was requested to illuminate the scene of the ditching with a searchlight. Within 26 minutes of the SOS being intercepted the five Canadian airmen were being landed at the Queen's Pier. Another instance was when an aircraft crash landed on the top of Snaefell. The wireless operator was able to work his set and a message was intercepted at Ramsey, the bearing of which was received by the controller who was able to work out the position of the aircraft. A message was sent to the crew asking them to fire lights and every coastguard was briefed to take a bearing of any such signals visible. In a short time the aircraft was located and within 30 minutes of the crash the crew had been rescued. Notable former pupils * Allan Bell, Politician * Alan Crowe, Politician * G.A.M.

She is currently the appointed Omar Clyde and Elizabeth Parr Aderhold Professor in Education (an endowed faculty research position at the University of Georgia), and an appointed University of Georgia distinguished research professor (most recent reappointment 2018‚Äì2023). She is a tenured professor of Language and Literacy Education at the University of Georgia.  Education  Alvermann graduated from Syracuse University in 1980 with a Ph.D. in Reading and Language Education, and an M.L.S in Information Studies. She also holds an M.A. from the University of Texas at Austin, with a major in Education and minor in History.  Theoretical framework  Alvermann's research builds on James Paul Gee's concepts of capital \\"D\\" Discourse and New Literacies, and Allan Luke's Four Literacies Model. She is also influenced by Michel Foucault's philosophy on Discourse and Social Constructionism (especially in regard to Maxine Greene's philosophy on how educational institutions should encourage students to challenge social categorization and power structures, and Judith Green's further development of these ideas), and Harold L. Herber's research on how students read. Patty Lather and Elizabeth St. Pierre's development of post-structuralist and Feminist theory also play a role, and their work on qualitative research in the field of Education provides an important research model.  Research  Multi-literacies = Currently, Alvermann's primary area of research is that of multi-literacies. In an increasingly digitized world, students use not only print-based texts, but those involving image, sound, and interaction. Students develop different literacies, some for in-school and some for out-of-school, but the boundary between academic and non-academic may be illusory. The texts students engage with are often interconnected, as they perform online searches on academic materials to supplement school materials, and seek help on their school work in online communities. Students develop these literacies for personal as well as academic reasons. Even many students who claim not to be readers engage in online discourse about their favorite media properties (including ‚Äúremixing‚Äù texts through things like fan-fiction). They also learn technical skills independently, editing videos, creating music, and designing web-pages. These digital practices can help students academically and in personal development. Those who might not have had the chance otherwise are able to cultivate a voice and an audience. In fact, many try on multiple voices, which may or may not resemble the identities they present in physical spaces. Many teachers are wary of digital literacies, thinking of them as irrelevant to academics at best. However, these multiple literacies are a reality in students' lives. With the high volume of information available, it can be difficult for students to learn to focus on what is important and think critically about the texts they engage; this is why it is important for teachers to help students develop their literacy skills for success in academics and beyond. In Alvermann's view, ‚Äúpreferable are studies designed to treat contexts not as structured, impermeable containers but as sieves through which social, cultural, economic, and political discourses animate one another.‚Äù = Popular culture = Related to Alvermann's studies in multi-literacies is her research on students' interests in popular culture and whether this can be used in the classroom. Although conventional thinking tends to view pop culture as shallow and unworthy of discussion, students are motivated to think critically about their favorite media; even those considered ‚Äústruggling readers‚Äù for their failure to live up to cultural academic standards often read and engage with the texts they enjoy of their own free will. This kind of ‚Äúplay‚Äù encourages free thinking. Alvermann advocates for bringing these personal interests into the classroom, mixing them with more traditional academics, and facilitating classroom discussion instead of unilateral lecture transmission of information from the teacher. Notably, this interaction should not be made to feel like work, as this will cause students to lose interest, nor should it focus solely on enjoyment, because this does not teach critical thinking skills. In addition to the motivational factor, students are also validated and feel appreciated when teachers take an interest in the media they enjoy. Teachers can collect information on students' interests through survey and conversation. = Literacy and domain knowledge = Another of Alvermann's prominent areas of research is on how teachers learn to teach not only the content but the discourse of their field. Alvermann argues that different academic disciplines require different and sometimes conflicting discourses, with different terminology, signs, and symbols. Students who are not familiar with the discourse in their field will have trouble understanding the content; therefore, it is important that teachers teach students to be literate in their field of study. However, many teachers fail to recognize this and rely on students' Language Arts classes to teach them general reading strategies. Alvermann's research in this area focuses on how teachers use self-reflection and experimentation with the resources available to them to develop strategies for helping students develop field-specific literacy. = Classroom discussion = Alvermann has advocated for classroom discussion of texts, rather than unilateral transmission of information from teachers. This encourages students to engage with on a critical level, as opposed to simply memorizing information. Students are also empowered and more encouraged to read when their personal thoughts and opinions on texts are validated. Class discussion also facilitates a sense of community among classmates. Strategies range from encouraging students to answer questions with detailed answers that draw from the text, to breaking students up into smaller groups so that everyone is involved in the discussion. Alvermann acknowledges pitfalls of class discussion, such as the tendency for students to get off topic, for a few to dominate the conversation, or for engagement in gendered behavior (female students qualifying or apologizing for their speech, reinforcement of beliefs about which texts will appeal to which gender, etc.). This is why it is important for teachers to moderate. While the type and degree of moderation necessary is still a topic of debate (and admittedly somewhat dependent on the class and subject matter), Alvermann advocates for an approach that encourages students to consider the social-political forces that have shaped not only the texts, but also their relationships to the texts and their identities as a whole. Graphic organizers (i.e. diagrams of central questions and topics for discussion) can also help focus discussion.

It consists of one Middle School, one High School and three Elementary Schools. Boundaries The district encompasses all but the northeastern corner of Bethel Township of Clark County, plus the southwestern corner of Pike Township of Clark County and part of the eastern side of Bethel Township of Miami County. The district thereby serves residents of the city of New Carlisle, the village of Donnelsville, the unincorporated communities of Medway, Park Layne, and Crystal Lakes, plus adjacent rural land. HistoryEarly settlement= The conclusion of the American Revolutionary War in 1783 resulted in, among other things, the British ceding to the newly formed United States a large swath of densely forested land west of Pennsylvania, northwest of the Ohio River, and east of the Mississippi River. This land was inhabited by Indian tribes, but a boundary set in 1785 by the Treaty of Greenville relegated the natives to the northern and western parts of this \\"Old Northwest\\" Territory. Two areas of the remaining land were claimed by Connecticut and Virginia for payment of military veterans. This left what is now the east, southeast, and southwest areas of the state of Ohio as U.S. Government-owned land to be surveyed, divided into townships, and opened to general settlement. Several other states' competing claims to this area were resolved by 1787, enabling the formal designation of the bulk of the entire region, including Indian land, as the new Northwest Territory. Settlement of the non-Indian portion of the Northwest Territory commenced in 1788 with the establishment of Marietta along the southeastern border. Tens of thousands of settlers that soon poured into the surrounding area; by 1800, there were 45,000 residents scattered throughout the eastern and southern parts of the territory, plus about 100 to 150 settlers within a 40 square mile radius of the settlement of Urbana‚Äîan area which includes a settlement established in 1790 by John Paul at the forks of Honey Creek, about one mile northeast of what is now New Carlisle. With the rapid settlement came a need for self-governance and the benefits of statehood. Ohio became the first state to be carved out of the Northwest Territory in 1803. =Private schools= Once settlers cleared the land, built homes, and planted crops, they fashioned institutions that were to bring civilization to the wilderness. Codes of law were drawn up and churches were established. Wherever half a dozen or more families lived reasonably close together, a log schoolhouse was usually to be found. Nevertheless, as early as 1805, according to Beers 1881 History, a schoolhouse was erected on the farm of Captain McPherson, located on Section 21, near the present site of Tecumseh High School. Another was located on the farm of George Lowman of New Carlisle, located near the juncture of present- day Addison-Carlisle Road and Route 235. Both were known as landmarks and used as points of reference by the early settlers. These schools were supported by private subscription, not public taxes. A subscription school was also supported in the village of New Carlisle possibility as early as 1810 or 1812. Other primitive schools in Bethel Township, previous to 1820, include Keifer Detrick, located just north of the present George Rogers Clark on Tecumseh Road; and Valley School, at the foot of Minnick's Hill on south Enon Road near the Valley Pike. There is some indication that it may have been the first school in Bethel Township. Apparently, John Layton, an early settler to the area, taught in a shanty at the foot of Minnick's hill in 1808. Wallace School, which was located at the northwest corner of the former Wallace farm at the junction of present-day Whaley and Union Roads was established about 1810 or 1812. The county was sparsely populated and children came on foot and horseback to attend the schools. The early efforts in establishing a free common school system for all in Ohio were haphazard and met with resistance. An act to provide for the \\"Regulation and Support of common Schools\\" was passed in 1821. The law committed the state to the idea of taxation, but it was permissive, not compulsory, and not designed to make \\"free public schools\\". Therefore, only the more affluent that could afford to pay a subscription could attend. Some enterprising teachers were paid in \\"trade\\". This included trading educational services for lodging, house rent, farm products, and clothing. The second generation of schools in Bethel Township began in 1835 when a new brick structure replaced the old log structure on the Wallace farm near where Whaley Road intersects Union Road. New Carlisle built a school on the northeast corner of Scott and Jefferson Streets in 1838. Over the next several years, school buildings were erected throughout the township in Medway, Donnelsville, the Bellefontaine Road (Route 235, on the present-day Gastineau property), Quick Road and Bethel, where Bethel Baptist Church is situated. The Linden Hill Academy was built in New Carlisle in 1850. Students came from throughout southwestern Ohio and even other states to attend this finishing school. =Public schools= By the conclusion of the Civil War, public opinion, in general, was positive and more progressive toward providing for schooling needs of our youth. Citizens were giving more willingly of their resources for the erection of buildings, the provision of furniture, educational materials, and the salaries of teachers. The citizens of New Carlisle and Bethel Township were no less interested in the furtherance of education for their children. From about 1867 through 1887, sub-district schools, numbering eleven different sites, were erected at convenient locations throughout the township most all within two miles of every child in the school districts. These schools provided the privilege of free public education placed within the reach of all and paid for by taxes. In 1880, after considerable opposition, a room was set aside in the Olive Branch building for the purpose of establishing a centralized High School for the township. New Carlisle had already established a centralized school in 1869, some eleven years earlier when they took over the old Linden Hill Academy from the Cincinnati United Methodist Conference. The agitation for a new school at Olive Branch began in February 1900. It would be seven years later (1907) before the first round structure was built. That building was destroyed by fire in 1913. A second structure was built on the same foundation. It was identical to the first building, with one exception. Doors were added to each classroom so students could easily exit the building in case of fire. The building served the district into the early 1970s. Today it is used as a district warehouse and storage center. The fourth generation of schools commenced with the building of the New Carlisle School on West Madison Street in 1921. The Medway, Donnelsville and Olive Branch buildings were erected over the next seven years. These schools served the district through the depression years and World War II. Following World War II, the community gave their overwhelming support to consolidate the New Carlisle Local Schools and Olive Branch Local Schools into the New Carlisle‚ÄìBethel Local School District. This occurred on June 15, 1948. =Modern schools= Construction on the district's new high school, Tecumseh, was begun in late 1950 and was completed in March 1952. The class of 1952, while not able to attend classes in the building, were privileged to hold Baccalaureate and Commencement exercises in the auditorium‚Äìgymnasium of the new complex in May of that year. The school was named after Tecumseh, a famous chief of the Shawnee Nation who lived in the area in the 19th century. The completion of Tecumseh ushered in the fifth generation of schools to be built in Bethel Township. For the next seventeen years, the district would grow from about 1000 to 6800 students. New buildings, building additions and renovations would continue almost non-stop until 1969 when McAdams was completed and opened for use. Beginning in the 1980‚Äì1981 school year, corporal punishment (paddling) was abolished in the district, in favor of the detention system, considered more contemporary and less cruel. Corporal punishment was not banned statewide until 2009. Prior to the 1981‚Äì1982 school year, the elementary schools hosted grades K‚Äì6, the two junior high schools hosted grades 7‚Äì9, and the high school hosted grades 10‚Äì12. Thereafter, the district restructured such that the elementary schools only hosted grades K‚Äì5, the junior highs became middle schools hosting grades 6‚Äì8, and the high school hosted grades 9‚Äì12. To facilitate the influx of 9th graders to the high school, Oscar T. Hawke Elementary was closed and the building was incorporated into the high school campus. Effective the 1989‚Äì1990 school year, the district's name changed from New Carlisle‚ÄìBethel Local Schools to Tecumseh Local School District, in order to alleviate confusion with Bethel Local Schools in nearby Miami County and Carlisle Local Schools in Carlisle, Ohio. At the beginning of the 2011‚Äì2012 school year, Medway Elementary was closed, and the elementary schools were rearranged from neighborhood schools to grade-level schools. Donnelsville Elementary houses grades K‚Äì1, Park Layne Elementary houses grades 2‚Äì3, New Carlisle Elementary houses grades 4‚Äì5.

Many terms have been applied to rain screen walls including basic, open, conventional, pressure-equalized, pressure-moderated rainscreen systems or assemblies. These terms have caused confusion as to what a rain screen is but all reflect the rainscreen principle of a primary and secondary line of defense. One technical difference is between a plane, a gap of or less and a channel, a gap of more than . In general terms a rainscreen wall may be called a cavity or drained wall.\\"Building Envelope Design Guide - Wall Systems\\" in Whole Building Design Guide The two other basic types of exterior walls in terms of water resistance are barrier walls which rely on the one exterior surface to prevent ingress and mass walls which allow but absorb some leakage. History In the early 1960s research was conducted in Norway on rain penetration of windows and walls, and √òivind Birkeland published a treatise referring to a \\"rain barrier\\". In 1963 the Canadian National Research Council published a pamphlet titled \\"Rain Penetration and its Control\\" using the term \\"open rain screen\\". Rainscreen cladding Rainscreen cladding is a kind of double-wall construction that utilizes a surface to help keep the rain out, as well as an inner layer to offer thermal insulation, prevent excessive air leakage and carry wind loading. The surface breathes just like a skin as the inner layer reduces energy losses. The rainscreen system For water to enter a wall first the water must get onto the wall and the wall must have openings. Water can then enter the wall by capillary action, gravity, momentum, and air pressure (wind). The rainscreen system provides for two lines of defense against the water intrusion into the walls: The rainscreen and a means to dissipate leakage often referred to as a channel. In a rainscreen the air gap allows the circulation of air on the moisture barrier. (These may or may not serve as a vapour barrier, which can be installed on the interior or exterior side of the insulation depending on the climate). This helps direct water away from the main exterior wall which in many climates is insulated. Keeping the insulation dry helps prevent problems such as mold formation and water leakage. The vapour-permeable air/weather barrier prevents water molecules from entering the insulated cavity but allows the passage of vapour, thus reducing the trapping of moisture within the main wall assembly. The air gap (or cavity) can be created in several ways. One method is to use furring (battens, strapping) fastened vertically to the wall. Ventilation openings are made at the bottom and top of the wall so air can naturally rise through the cavity. Wall penetrations including windows and doors require special care to maintain the ventilation. In the pressure-equalized system the ventilation openings must be large enough to allow air-flow to equalize the pressure on both sides of the cladding. A ratio of 10:1 cladding leakage area to ventilation area has been suggested. A water/air resistant membrane is placed between the furring and the sheathing to prevent rain water from entering the wall structure. The membrane directs water away and toward special drip edge flashings which protect other parts of the building. Insulation may be provided beneath the membrane. The thickness of insulation is determined by building code requirements as well as performance requirements set out by the architect. The system is a form of double-wall construction that uses an outer layer to keep out the rain and an inner layer to provide thermal insulation, prevent excessive air leakage and carry wind loading. The outer layer breathes like a skin while the inner layer reduces energy losses. The structural frame of the building is kept absolutely dry, as water never reaches it or the thermal insulation. Evaporation and drainage in the cavity removes water that penetrates between panel joints. Water droplets are not driven through the panel joints or openings because the rainscreen principle means that wind pressure acting on the outer face of the panel is equalized in the cavity. Therefore, there is no significant pressure differential to drive the rain through joints. During extreme weather, a minimal amount of water may penetrate the outer cladding. This, however, will run as droplets down the back of the cladding sheets and be dissipated through evaporation and drainage. The rainscreen drainage plane Typical layers in a wall system with rainscreen drainage plane A rainscreen drainage plane is an air gap and the water resistant barrier of a rainscreen. Together they provide a predictable, unobstructed path drainage for liquid moisture to drain from a high point of the wall (where it enters) to a low point of the wall (where it exits) the wall detail. The drainage plane must move the water out of the wall system quickly to prevent absorption and consequential rot, mold, and structural degradation. A drainage plane > is designed to shed bulk rainwater and/or condensation downward and outward > in a manner that will prevent uncontrolled water penetration into the > conditioned spaces of a building or structure. In a barrier wall system, the > exterior cladding also serves as the principal drainage plane and primary > line of defense against bulk rainwater penetration.

In Construction Technology Update. Retrieved March 1, 2009 from A rainscreen drainage plane that works as a predictable pressure equalization plane creates a separation (an air chamber) between the backside of a rainscreen and the exterior surface of the weather-resistant barrier that is installed on the exterior sheeting of the structural back up wall. This separation allows air contaminated with water vapor from all points in that wall system to exit the interior of the wall system. Moisture laden air that is allowed to pressurize will attempt to move to a lower pressure area that may be deeper into the interior of a wall detail. =Technical considerations= *To prevent bridging due to capillary action, Building Science Consulting recommends the drainage plane maintain a cavity of 3/8\\" or greater, though smaller cavities with hydrophobic materials can also provide the capillary break.BSD-013: Rain Control in Buildings (September 2008).

Effectiveness dwindles rapidly with bigger ones, smaller ones tend to clog quickly. =Entrapped moisture risks= Once moisture has penetrated deep into a wall system through the weather resistant barrier and into the exterior sheathing, the wall is deep wet. The air flow that exists in most wall systems is a slight draft that will not dry this condition out in a timely manner. The result is a compromised wall system with rot, rust, and mold potential. The structural integrity of the wall is at stake, as is the health of the occupants.

History of the park Deptford Park was originally a market garden belonging to the estate of the Evelyn family. Located near the River Thames, it was renowned for its onions, celery and asparagus. In 1884, London County Council bought the land for the creation of a public park. It was designed by the chief parks officer Lt Col J.J. Sexby and opened to the public in 1897. Park design and features The park covers an area of and is accessed from Evelyn Street, with the entrance retaining traditional iron gates and railings and a small avenue of London plane trees.

Recent regeneration of the park has included installation of a new children‚Äôs playground and ‚ÄòThe Avenue‚Äô, a redesigned entrance way leading to a formal paved area with seating. In 2015, a consultation was announced to put in an astroturf pitch in the South West corner of the park.

Few fossils of Bergisuchus have been discovered, only a single incomplete snout, a few partial lower jaws and some teeth. Despite being fragmentary, the jaw bones are enough to indicate that Bergisuchus had a short, deep, narrow snout and serrated teeth, quite unlike the broad flat snouts of modern crocodylians. As with other sebecosuchians, it is likely that Bergisuchus was a fast, terrestrial predator and not an aquatic ambush hunter like modern crocodylians. Its presence in Europe is also unusual, as later sebecosuchians were restricted entirely to South America, and so Bergisuchus indicates the group was once much more widespread in the early Cenozoic. History of Discovery Bergisuchus was first discovered by Dr. Dietrich Berg from the German Messel Pit in 1966, who originally classified it as an unnamed new species of sebecosuchian with close affinities to Sebecus, notable for being the first sebecosuchian remains to be recognised outside South America. It was named and described two years later in 1968 by German palaeontologist Oskar Kuhn, who named the binomial Bergisuchus dietrichbergi in honour of Dr. Berg and combined it with the Greek suffix suchos for \\"crocodile\\". Bergisuchus is known from the holotype snout and lower jaw (HLMD-Me 7003) from the Messel Pit near Darmstadt first reported in 1966, dated to the Mammal Paleogene zone (MP) 11, and an additional incomplete pair of mandibles (GM XVIII-49) from the Geiseltal open-pit coal mine near Halle in the state of Saxony-Anhalt from the slightly younger MP 12. The holotype is stored in the Hessisches Landesmuseum Darmstadt, while the paratype is housed in the Geiseltal Collection of the Center for Natural Science Collections at the Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg, in Germany. In 2015, osteoderms from karst deposits dated to the Middle Eocene in Lissieu, France, were tentatively suggested to belong to Bergisuchus sp., or alternatively to Iberosuchus sp. (another European sebecosuchian). This referral was based on the similarity between the osteoderms and those of Baurusuchus and other sebecosuchians, as the two genera are the only known European sebecosuchians. Description Bergisuchus is only represented by the holotype snout and lower jaw (HLMD-Me 7003) and the referred pair of lower jaws (GM XVIII-49), so much of its anatomy is unknown. The snout is tall and laterally compressed, unlike the broad flat snouts of modern crocodylians, with tall nasals that form a raised, sharp midline along the length of the snout. Rossmann and colleagues reconstructed the incomplete premaxillae as tall and steep based on the dimensions of the maxilla, more similar in shape to those of Baurusuchus, Barinasuchus and Bretesuchus than to Sebecus. The premaxilla may also have sloped downwards, similar to that of Bretesuchus. Overall, the snout is relatively short and deep compared to the long, low skull of Sebecus. A deep notch is present between the maxilla and premaxilla to house the large lower canine tooth, along with a prominent bulge of bone above each. Based on the shape of the known snout, it's likely that Bergisuchus had separate nostril openings that faced laterally on the surface, as well as laterally facing eyes, unlike modern crocodylians. Also, it shares with Iberosuchus the unusual presence of a small antorbital fenestra, a feature that's invariably absent in both baurusuchids and sebecids. The surface of the maxilla is profusely sculpted with ridges and grooves, a feature that clearly distinguishes it from Iberosuchus. The lower jaws are mostly only known from incomplete dentaries (as well as part of the splenial), and their surfaces are as similarly strongly sculpted as the upper jaws. The teeth are relatively narrow and serrated (ziphodont), similar to those of predatory theropod dinosaurs and unlike the conical teeth of modern crocodylians. Few teeth themselves are preserved, but they include a very large and prominent serrated 'pseudocanine' that fits into the notch of the upper jaw. This canine is approximately 2 cm tall, and sits on a prominently raised portion of the jaw bone, which arches down in front and behind it and so the rest of the jaw is quite shallow. The rest of the teeth are mostly missing, but the size and shape of the remaining alveoli indicate the size and position of the other teeth in the jaws. The other teeth are around 3 times smaller in diameter than the canines, a unique characteristic of this genus, and are closely packed behind the canine in the lower jaw. Three small teeth are present in front of the canine, the first of which is larger and procumbent, facing up and forwards at the front of the jaw. The maxillary teeth are similarly small, the largest being the third tooth, and the rest of which getting progressively smaller behind it. Premaxillary teeth are unknown, but it possibly had another pair of larger 'pseudocanines' in the upper jaw. It is estimated that there were only 13 teeth in each lower jaw, and at least 13‚Äî14 in the upper jaw, a relatively small number compared to other sebecosuchians like Iberosuchus. The teeth are not as strongly compressed as other ziphodont crocodilians, and so may have been stronger and more resistant to stress. Rossmann and colleagues estimated the total body length of Bergisuchus to be around based on other short-snouted, partially terrestrial crocodylians including Allognathosuchus and the extant dwarf caimans Paleosuchus. Despite its small size, they believed both specimens to represent mature adults, based on both the degree of fusion between the sutures in the skull and the extent of the dermal sculpting on the surface of the bones. As a sebecosuchian, Bergisuchus likely had long limbs that were positioned directly under its body and moved with a parasagittal gait, unlike the sprawling limbs of modern crocodylians. It is unknown if it had a reduced covering of osteoderms like some other sebecosuchians, but no osteoderms were found associated with either individual (although isolated osteoderms have been tentatively referred to this genus). Classification Bergisuchus was identified as a sebecosuchian by Dr. Berg when it was first discovered, closely allied to the South American genus Sebecus as \\"aff. Sebecus? n. sp.\\". It was later variously assigned to the family Baurusuchidae by Steel in 1973, and also in the now defunct family Trematochampsidae by Buffetaut in 1988. At the time it was unclear what diagnostic traits where unique to each group and which were shared between them, and so the fragmentary Bergisuchus could not be confidently identified and was sometimes placed in incertae sedis for this reason. In 2000, the sebecosuchian affinities of Bergisuchus, particularly to Sebecus, were established by Rossmann and colleagues in a thorough re- examination of the material, and it was assigned to its own monotypic family, the Bergisuchidae, as it was considered too distinct from Sebecus to belong to the same family. The position of Bergisuchus as a close relative of Sebecus has since been supported by a number of phylogenetic analyses of Mesozoic and Cenozoic mesoeucrocodylians, although the interrelationships of Bergisuchus, Sebecidae and other clades are not settled. The cladograms below are simplified from two recent phylogenetic analyses of mesoeucrocodylians, that of Pol et al. (2014) and of Piacentini Pinheiro et al. (2018), displaying the alternative arrangements of Sebecidae in either Sebecosuchia and Sebecia.Sebecosuchia is cladistically defined as the node containing Sebecidae and Baurusuchidae, assuming a close relationship between the two. Sebecia is a similar concept but for the node containing Sebecidae and Peirosauridae. The validity of each clade depends on the position of Sebecidae within Mesoeucrocodylia, often involving its relationship to Notosuchia. The former analysis found Bergisuchus and Iberosuchus as sebecosuchians closely related to but excluded from Sebecidae, while the latter analysis recovers Bergisuchus well within Sebecidae, as per the definitions used in the study: Topology of Pol et al. (2014): Topology of Piacentini Pinheiro et al. (2018): PalaeobiologyPalaeoecology= Skeleton of the contemporary terrestrial crocodilian Boverisuchus.The Messel Pit is famous for its well-preserved fossils, which include semi-aquatic crocodylians such as Asiatosuchus and Diplocynodon. Unlike these crocodylians, Bergisuchus was a small terrestrial hypercarnivore. Rossmann and colleagues speculated extensively about the palaeoecology of Bergisuchus. They suggested that Bergisuchus did not inhabit the fluvial and lacustrine habitats around the Messel and Geiseltal sites. They interpreted the rare, fragmented material as evidence for the bones being transported into these settings from elsewhere, compared to the more abundant and more complete crocodylians from these sites that were well preserved by the local conditions. They further speculated that Bergisuchus may have inhabited drier upland regions from these lakes and rivers, potentially coexisting alongside predatory creodont mammals in the Geiseltal area and avoiding competition with the similarly terrestrial but unrelated planocraniid crocodilians like Boverisuchus. The reduced ziphodont dentition of Bergisuchus with large teeth concentrated at the front of the jaws is somewhat similar to that of baurusuchids such as Stratiotosuchus, which have reduced their maxillary tooth count down to only 5 teeth. This has been suggested to be a specialisation for hunting large-sized prey items by imparting more powerful bites at the very front of the jaws. This is unlike the condition of most other sebecids, which have more generalised dentitions with similarly sized teeth throughout the jaw, which may have preferred smaller to mid-sized prey. The deeper snout and less compressed, stronger teeth of Bergisuchus also suggest that it was capable of withstanding greater forces relatively than planocraniids, and is inferred to be capable of catching and dismembering prey by thrashing its head in any direction, unlike planocraniids. The unusual differentiated heterodont teeth were interpreted as evidence for a relatively complex method for processing food, and they suggested that Bergisuchus used the large canines at the front of the jaws as fangs and the smaller rear teeth to \\"chew\\" and process food before swallowing. They also suggested that the huge, exaggerated canines could possibly have been used as sexual signals or as weapons in intraspecific competition, rather than predation. =Palaeobiogeography= The presence of Bergisuchus in Europe has been regarded as evidence for a connection between the faunas from South America and Europe in the early Eocene, as other Cenozoic sebecosuchians are mostly known from South America. This link has been supported by the presence of other South American lineages contemporaneous with Bergisuchus in the Messel pit, including purported phorusrhacid birds and herpetotheriid marsupials. Eocene European ecosystems containing sebecosuchians like Bergisuchus have been compared to those of later South America, with predator guilds composed of mammals, phorusrhacids and sebecosuchians, supporting this affinity. Furthermore, Bergisuchus and Iberosuchus do not appear to be closely related to the Cretaceous sebecosuchian Doratodon, which was found across Europe during the Late Cretaceous. This appears to indicate that Bergisuchus and other European sebecosuchians did not descend from Cretaceous European sebecosuchians like Doratodon, but was instead part of a separate invasion of sebecosuchians into Europe during the Palaeogene from South America. This is further supported by the presence of the Algerian Eocene sebecosuchian Eremosuchus in Africa, which has been suggested to be evidence that sebecosuchians reached Europe from South America via Africa, as opposed to through North America where no sebecosuchian remains have been found.

Work was born in Akron, Ohio but moved to Dukedom, Tennessee, with his family at age two. He picked up guitar at age seven, and learned fiddle and songwriting by his early teens. By 1945, he had begun playing professionally in Pontiac, Michigan, where many Southerners had moved to take jobs in the automotive industry. He appeared on local radio and published a songbook late in the decade, in addition to recording two singles for the Trophy Records label. His third single was \\"Tennessee Border\\", for Alben Records; his version was not a hit, but the following year, the song became a hit for Red Foley, Bob Atcher, Jimmie Skinner, and Tennessee Ernie Ford. Hank Williams also recorded the tune, but didn't chart with it. Work then signed with Decca Records in 1949 and that same year appeared for the first time on the Grand Ole Opry and on Ernest Tubb's Midnight Jamboree. He recorded for Decca with members of Red Foley's band, but none of his Decca recordings were hits, and the label dropped him in 1950. Subsequently, he recorded for Bullet, London, and Capitol, the last of which released him in 1953. Signing soon after with Dot Records, he finally found chart success in 1955 with the songs \\"Making Believe\\" (somewhat overshadowed by Kitty Wells phenomenally popular cover) and \\"That's What Makes the Jukebox Play\\". He played a few concerts with Elvis Presley that year. Later in the 1950s his fortunes in music declined, and he began working in real estate. He cut a few singles in 1959 for All Records and continued to write songs, working for Acuff-Rose. Bear Family Records began reissuing Work's recordings in 1986. He returned to Dukedom in the 1980s to retire from music. He worked as a millwright at the Goodyear plant in Union City, Tennessee, for several years before fully retiring. Work died on December 22, 2018, at the age of 94. He lived in Dukedom with his wife.

Synopsis The old men speak of a time many years ago when hundreds of starships were visible in the nighttime sky, but now the world is old, poor and forgotten. Raud the Keeper is surprised one day when a local man named Vahr Farg‚Äôs son brings two men from another world to his home. It seems that the men are scholars who have heard of the great crown that Raud is charged with keeping, and they wish to see it. The men inform Raud that his world is actually Terra, the world where man was born, and that the crown is none other than that of Great Britain, the last nation to join the Terran Federation in the ‚ÄúThird Century Pre- Interstellar.‚Äù They wish to take the crown to the capital world of the Empire, to Dremna, to protect it, and they are willing to pay handsomely for it. But, Raud cannot give up the sacred trust that his family has been guarding since time immemorial. After the men from the stars leave, however, Vahr returns with three people from the south, and steals the crown. And so, Raud the Keeper sets off on the men‚Äôs trail, determined to retrieve the crown. After a heroic adventure, Raud takes the crown, and goes off to meet the men from the stars, whom he now learns are actually princes of the Empire. Raud had decided that he could no longer protect the crown, and without children, there would be no one after him to keep it. The story ends with Raud deciding how he will keep his newfound fortune, and how he will protect it.

A gamma-ray burst is a highly luminous flash associated with an explosion in a distant galaxy and producing gamma rays, the most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation, and often followed by a longer-lived \\"afterglow\\" emitted at longer wavelengths (X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and radio). GRB 970508 was detected by the Gamma Ray Burst Monitor on the Italian‚ÄìDutch X-ray astronomy satellite BeppoSAX. Astronomer Mark Metzger determined that GRB 970508 occurred at least 6 billion light years from Earth; this was the first measurement of the distance to a gamma-ray burst. Until this burst, astronomers had not reached a consensus regarding how far away GRBs occur from Earth. Some supported the idea that GRBs occur within the Milky Way, but are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and are extremely energetic. Although the possibility of multiple types of GRBs meant that the two theories were not mutually exclusive, the distance measurement unequivocally placed the source of the GRB outside the Milky Way, effectively ending the debate. GRB 970508 was also the first burst with an observed radio frequency afterglow. By analyzing the fluctuating strength of the radio signals, astronomer Dale Frail calculated that the source of the radio waves had expanded almost at the speed of light. This provided strong evidence that GRBs are relativistically expanding explosions. Discovery Artist's conception of BeppoSAX in orbit A gamma-ray burst (GRB) is a highly luminous flash of gamma rays‚Äîthe most energetic form of electromagnetic radiation. GRBs were first detected in 1967 by the Vela satellites (a series of spacecraft designed to detect nuclear explosions in space).Schilling 2002, pp. 12-16 The initial burst is often followed by a longer-lived \\"afterglow\\" emitted at longer wavelengths (X-ray, ultraviolet, optical, infrared, and radio). The first GRB afterglow to be discovered was the X-ray afterglow of GRB 970228,Costa 1997 which was detected by BeppoSAX, an Italian-Dutch satellite originally designed to study X-rays.Schilling 2002, pp. 58-60 On Thursday May 8, 1997, at 21:42 UTC, BeppoSAX's Gamma Ray Burst Monitor registered a gamma-ray burst that lasted approximately 15 seconds.Pedersen 1997 It was also detected by Ulysses, a robotic space probe designed to study the Sun,Pian 1998 and by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) on board the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory.Kouveliotou 1997 The burst also occurred within the field of view of one of BeppoSAX's two X-ray Wide Field Cameras. Within a few hours, the BeppoSAX team localized the burst to an error box‚Äîa small area around the specific position to account for the error in the position‚Äîwith a diameter of approximately 10 arcminutes.Schilling 2002, pp. 115-116 Observations The Very Large Array in New Mexico After a rough position of the burst had been determined, Enrico Costa of the BeppoSAX team contacted astronomer Dale Frail at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory's Very Large Array. Frail began making observations at a wavelength of 20 centimeters at 01:30 UTC, less than four hours after the discovery. While preparing for his observations Frail contacted astronomer Stanislav Djorgovski, who was working with the Hale telescope. Djorgovski immediately compared his images of the region with older images from the Digitized Sky Survey, but he found no new sources of light within the error box. Mark Metzger, a colleague of Djorgovski at the Caltech observatory, conducted a more extensive analysis of the data, but was also unable to identify any new light sources.Schilling 2002, pp. 116-117 The following evening Djorgovski again observed the region. He compared the images from both nights but the error box contained no objects that had decreased in luminosity between May 8 and May 9. Metzger noticed one object that had increased in luminosity, but he assumed it was a variable star rather than the GRB afterglow. Titus Galama and Paul Groot, members of a research team in Amsterdam led by Jan van Paradijs, compared images taken by the WIYN Telescope on May 8 and the William Herschel Telescope on May 9\\\\. They were also unable to find any light sources which had faded during that time. After discovering the burst's X-ray afterglow, the BeppoSAX team provided a more accurate localization, and what Metzger had assumed to be a variable star was still present in this smaller error box. Both the Caltech team and the Amsterdam team were hesitant to publish any conclusions on the variable object. On May 10 Howard Bond of the Space Telescope Science Institute published his discovery,Bond 1997 which was later confirmed to be the burst's optical afterglow.Schilling 2002, pp. 118-120 On the night between May 10 and May 11, 1997, Metzger's colleague Charles Steidel recorded the spectrum of the variable object at the W. M. Keck Observatory. He then sent the data to Metzger, who after identifying a system of absorption lines associated with magnesium and iron determined a redshift of z = 0.8349 ¬± 0.0002,Varendoff 2001, p. 383Metzger 1997aMetzger 1997b indicating that light from the burst had been absorbed by matter roughly 6 billion light-years from Earth.Katz 2002, p. 148 Although the redshift of the burst itself had not been determined, the absorbent matter was necessarily located between the burst and the Earth, implying that the burst itself was at least as far away.Schilling 2002, pp. 121‚Äì123Katz 2002, p. 149 The absence of Lyman-alpha forest features in the spectra constrained the redshift to z ‚â§ 2.3, while further investigation by Daniel E. Reichart of the University of Chicago suggested a redshift of z ‚âà 1.09. This was the first instance in which scientists were able to measure the redshift of a GRB.Schilling 2002, p. 120Reichart 1998 Several optical spectra were also obtained at the Calar Alto Observatory at wavelength ranges of and , but no emission lines were identified.Castro-Tirado 1998 On May 13, five days after the first detection of GRB 970508, Frail resumed his observations with the Very Large Array. He made observations of the burst's position at a wavelength of 3.5 cm and immediately detected a strong signal. After 24 hours, the 3.5 cm signal became significantly stronger, and he also detected signals at the 6 and 21 cm wavelengths. This was the first confirmed observation of a radio afterglow of a GRB.Schilling 2002, p. 124Katz 2002, p. 147NRAO 1997 Over the next month, Frail observed that the luminosity of the radio source fluctuated significantly from day to day but increased on average. The fluctuations did not occur simultaneously along all of the observed wavelengths, which Jeremy Goodman of Princeton University explained as being the result of the radio waves being bent by interstellar plasma in the Milky Way. Such radio scintillations (rapid variations in the radio luminosity of an object) occur only when the source has an apparent diameter of less than 3 microarcseconds.Schilling 2002, p. 125 Characteristics BeppoSAX's Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor, operating in the energy range of 40-700 keV, recorded a fluence of (1.85 ¬± 0.3) √ó 10‚àí6 erg/cm2 (1.85 ¬± 0.3 nJ/m2), and the Wide Field Camera (2-26 keV) recorded a fluence of (0.7 ¬± 0.1) √ó 10‚àí6 erg/cm2 (0.7 ¬± 0.1 nJ/m2).Galama 1998 BATSE (20-1000 keV) recorded a fluence of (3.1 ¬± 0.2) √ó 10‚àí6 erg/cm2 (3.1 ¬± 0.2 nJ/m2). About 5 hours after the burst the apparent magnitude of the object‚Äîa logarithmic measure of its brightness with a higher number indicating a fainter object‚Äîwas 20.3 ¬± 0.3 in the U-band (the ultraviolet region of the spectrum) and 21.2 ¬± 0.1 in the R-band (the red region of the spectrum). The afterglow reached its peak luminosity in both bands approximately 2 days after the burst was first detected‚Äî19.6 ¬± 0.3 in the U-band at 02:13 UTC on May 11, and 19.8 ¬± 0.2 in the R-band at 20:55 UTC on May 10. James E. Rhoads, an astronomer at the Kitt Peak National Observatory, analyzed the burst and determined that it was not strongly beamed.Rhoads 1999 Further analysis by Frail and his colleagues indicated that the total energy released by the burst was approximately 5√ó1050 ergs (5√ó1043 J), and Rhoads determined that the total gamma-ray energy was approximately 3√ó1050 erg (3√ó1043 J). This implied that the gamma-ray and kinetic energy of the burst's ejecta were comparable, effectively ruling out those GRB models which are relatively inefficient at producing gamma rays.Paczy≈Ñski 1999, p. 2 Distance scale and emission model Prior to this burst, astronomers had not reached consensus regarding how far away GRBs occur from Earth. Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested that they do not occur within the disk of the Milky Way, some astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the Milky Way's halo, concluding that the bursts are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected because they are extremely energetic. The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.Schilling 2002, p. 123 Throughout the month of May the radio scintillations became less noticeable until they ceased altogether. This implies that the radio source significantly expanded in the time that had passed since the burst was detected. Using the known distance to the source and the elapsed time before the scintillation ended, Frail calculated that the radio source had expanded at almost the speed of light.Waxman 1998 While various existing models already encompassed the notion of a relativistically expanding fireball, this was the first strong evidence to support such a model.Schilling 2002, p. 126Piran 1999, p. 23 Host galaxy Image of GRB 970508's host galaxy taken in August 1998 The afterglow of GRB 970508 reached a peak total luminosity 19.82 days after the burst was detected. It then faded with a power law slope over about 100 days. The afterglow eventually disappeared, revealing the burst's host, an actively star-forming dwarf galaxy with an apparent magnitude of V = 25.4 ¬± 0.15.Bloom 1998 The galaxy was well fitted by an exponential disk with an ellipticity of 0.70 ¬± 0.07. The redshift of GRB 970508's optical afterglow, z = 0.835, agreed with the host galaxy's redshift of z = 0.83, suggesting that, unlike previously observed bursts, GRB 970508 may have been associated with an active galactic nucleus.Fruchter 2000 NotesReferences        970508 19970508 Category:May 1997 events Category:Camelopardalis (constellation) ","title":"GRB 970508"},{"id":"21779596","text":"Georg Robert von Pasterwitz (7 June 1730 - 26 January 1803) was an Austrian composer and teacher. He was born in Bierh√ºtten, near Passau. First educated at Niederaltaich, he entered the Benedictine monastery in Kremsm√ºnster in 1749. He then enrolled at the University of Salzburg, studying theology, law and mathematics. It was during this time that he met Johann Ernst Eberlin, who became his music teacher. Pasterwitz completed his studies in 1759 and soon started teaching philosophy at the monastery's Ritterakademie, eventually rising to teach courses in mathematics, physics, economics, and political science; since about 1755 he was also active as composer, producing stage works for the monastery almost every year. Between 1767 and 1783 Pasterwitz served as the monastery's choir director. Due to reforms started by Joseph II, he had to give up some of his duties and became instead the monastery's treasurer and eventually official representative, when it was threatened with dissolution in 1785. Pasterwitz died in 1803 in Kremsm√ºnster, having served as dean of the Upper School there until 1801. Pasterwitz's surviving oeuvre comprises some 500 works, mostly liturgical pieces and dramatic works for the church. He composed a large number of short contrapuntal pieces for keyboard: 324 were published between 1790 and 1803, and were the only works published during the composer's lifetime.

Hancock's behaviour annoys the other actors and producers, so they kill off his character, only to find the audience holds the character in great affection. Hancock has difficulties finding new work, but audience reaction compels the BBC to resurrect his character by discovering a long-lost twin brother, Ben, in a new programme called The Merriweathers, with Hancock's involvement resuming under a lucrative new contract. In the first programme, a substantial portion of the village fall down a disused mine-shaft, and Ben proposes repopulating the village with his other relatives (all to be played by Hancock). The supporting cast includes Patrick Cargill as the producer, Peter Glaze as an animal impersonator and Brian Oulton as the actor portraying the patriarch of the Bowmans family. The plot may have been inspired by the death of the character Grace Archer in The Archers in September 1955.

Examples include protein folding, chemical reactions and nucleation. Standard simulation tools such as molecular dynamics can generate the dynamical trajectories of all the atoms in the system. However, because of the gap in accessible time-scales between simulation and reality, even present supercomputers might require years of simulations to show an event that occurs once per microsecond without some kind of acceleration.  Transition path ensemble  TPS focuses on the most interesting part of the simulation, the transition. For example, an initially unfolded protein will vibrate for a long time in an open-string configuration before undergoing a transition and fold on itself. The aim of the method is to reproduce precisely those folding moments. Consider in general a system with two stable states A and B. The system will spend a long time in those states and occasionally jump from one to the other. There are many ways in which the transition can take place. Once a probability is assigned to each of the many pathways, one can construct a Monte Carlo random walk in the path space of the transition trajectories, and thus generate the ensemble of all transition paths. All the relevant information can then be extracted from the ensemble, such as the reaction mechanism, the transition states, and the rate constants. Given an initial path, TPS provides some algorithms to perturb that path and create a new one. As in all Monte Carlo walks, the new path will then be accepted or rejected in order to have the correct path probability. The procedure is iterated and the ensemble is gradually sampled. A powerful and efficient algorithm is the so-called shooting move. Consider the case of a classical many-body system described by coordinates r and momenta p. Molecular dynamics generates a path as a set of (rt, pt) at discrete times t in [0,T] where T is the length of the path. For a transition from A to B, (r0, p0) is in A, and (rT, pT) is in B. One of the path times is chosen at random, the momenta p are modified slightly into p + Œ¥p, where Œ¥p is a random perturbation consistent with system constraints, e.g. conservation of energy and linear and angular momentum. A new trajectory is then simulated from this point, both backward and forward in time until one of the states is reached. Being in a transition region, this will not take long. If the new path still connects A to B it is accepted, otherwise it is rejected and the procedure starts again.  Rate constant computation  In the Bennett‚ÄìChandler procedure the rate constant kAB for the transition from A to B is derived from the correlation function : C(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\langle h_A(0) h_B(t) \\\\rangle}{\\\\langle h_A \\\\rangle} where hA(B) is the characteristic function of state A(B), and hA(B)(t) is either 1 if the system at time t is in state A(B) or 0 if not. The time-derivative C'(t) starts at time 0 at the transition state theory (TST) value kABTST and reaches a plateau kAB ‚â§ kABTST for times of the order of the transition time. Hence once the function is known up to these times, the rate constant is also available. In the TPS framework C(t) can be rewritten as an average in the path ensemble : k_{AB}^{TPS}(t) = \\\\frac{d}{dt}C(t) = \\\\frac{\\\\langle \\\\dot{h_B(t)} \\\\rangle_{AB}}{\\\\langle h_B(t') \\\\rangle_{AB}} C(t') where the subscript AB denotes an average in the ensemble of paths that start in A and visit B at least once. Time t' is an arbitrary time in the plateau region of C(t). The factor C(t') at this specific time can be computed with a combination of path sampling and umbrella sampling.  Transition interface sampling  The TPS rate constant calculation can be improved in a variation of the method called Transition interface sampling (TIS). In this method the transition region is divided in subregions using interfaces. The first interface defines state A and the last state B. The interfaces are not physical interfaces but hypersurfaces in the phase space. The rate constant can be viewed as a flux through these interfaces. The rate kAB is the flux of trajectories starting before the first interface and going through the last interface. Being a rare event, the flux is very small and practically impossible to compute with a direct simulation. However, using the other interfaces between the states, one can rewrite the flux in terms of transition probabilities between interfaces k_{AB} = \\\\Phi_{1,0} \\\\prod_{i=1}^{n-1} P_A (i+1i) where PA(i + 1i) is the probability for trajectories, coming from state A and crossing interface i, to reach interface i + 1\\\\. Here interface 0 defines state A and interface n defines state B. The factor Œ¶1,0 is the flux through the interface closest to A. By making this interface close enough, the quantity can be computed with a standard simulation, as the crossing event through this interface is not a rare event any more. Remarkably, in the formula above there is no Markov assumption of independent transition probabilities. The quantities PA(i + 1i) carry a subscript A to indicate that the probabilities are all dependent on the history of the path, all the way from when it left A. These probabilities can be computed with a path sampling simulation using the TPS shooting move. A path crossing interface i is perturbed and a new path is shot. If the path still starts from A and crosses interface i, is accepted. The probability PA(i + 1i) follows from the ratio of the number of paths that reach interface i + 1 to the total number of paths in the ensemble. Theoretical considerations show that TIS computations are at least twice as fast as TPS, and computer experiments have shown that the TIS rate constant can converge up to 10 times faster. A reason for this is due to TIS using paths of adjustable length and on average shorter than TPS. Also, TPS relies on the correlation function C(t), computed by summation of positive and negative terms due to recrossings. TIS instead computes the rate as an effective positive flux, the quantity kAB is directly computed as an average of only positive terms contributing to the interface transition probabilities.  Time Dependent Processes  TPS/TIS as normally implemented can be acceptable for non-equilibrium calculations provided that the interfacial fluxes are time-independent (stationary). To treat non-stationary systems in which there is time dependence in the dynamics, due either to variation of an external parameter or to evolution of the system itself, then other rare event methods may be needed, such as Stochastic Process Rare Event Sampling.

Sycamore Dale is one of several historic estates along South Branch River Road (County Route 8). It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on December 2, 1980. HistoryConstruction= Sycamore Dale was constructed for David Gibson between 1836 and 1839 with the use of slave labor. The slaves involved with Sycamore Dale's construction numbered over 100. =American Civil War=General Lew Wallace Due to its location adjacent to the Romney Covered Bridge which carried the Northwestern Turnpike across the South Branch Potomac River, Sycamore Dale's vicinity was a strategic location for forces attempting to take Romney during the American Civil War. When Union Army forces first moved on Romney on June 11, 1861, there was resistance by Confederate States Army forces to their crossing of the covered bridge. The resistance consisted of Confederate sharpshooters who had commandeered Sycamore Dale and were using it as a \\"sharpshooter's nest.\\" The Union forces, commanded by General Lew Wallace (later Governor of New Mexico Territory, United States Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, and author of best-seller historical fiction novels such as Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ), advanced across the bridge and succeeded in dislodging the Confederates. Following the skirmish, General Wallace gave orders for Sycamore Dale to be burnt before proceeding up Town Hill into Romney. Upon his return later in the day, General Wallace found the house unscathed and, after heated inquiry, found that his captain had been dissuaded from the act of arson by the owner, David Gibson. After listening to Gibson's plea himself, General Wallace relented and, it is said, briefly used the house as his headquarters. General Wallace wrote part of Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ during his stay at Sycamore Dale. McNeill's Rangers surrender Another significant event of the American Civil War to occur at Sycamore Dale was the surrender of the McNeill's Rangers. McNeill's Rangers was an independent irregular Confederate military company commissioned under the Partisan Ranger Act by the Congress of the Confederate States on April 12, 1862. After the Act's repeal on February 17, 1864, McNeill's Rangers was one of two partisan companies allowed to continue operation, the other being Mosby's Raiders. The Rangers numbered no more than 60 to 70. Captain McNeill and his Rangers surrendered to Union Army forces on April 12, 1865, on Sycamore Dale's front lawn. Other sources cite that while Romney was last held by Confederate Army forces on April 15, local tradition states that McNeill's Rangers surrendered at Sycamore Dale on May 8. Led by Jesse McNeill, the 36 Rangers threw their weapons into a pile on Sycamore Dale's lawn and then the Union officers reluctantly agreed to release the Rangers. This surrender was one of the final actions of the American Civil War in West Virginia. ArchitectureExterior= Sycamore Dale's brickwork is laid in a Flemish bond arrangement. The bricks used in its construction were fired in the home's vicinity. Its lumber was also milled nearby. Sycamore Dale is graced with two end chimneys and a medium gable roof of tin. The front of the house is symmetrically divided into five bays centered on a large two-story, one bay wide portico. This two-story portico is supported by eight Tuscan columns and is surmounted on the second level with a Greek Revival style pediment with plain entablature. Both the first and second levels of its portico have Greek Revival entrance doors, both of which are flanked by triple-paned sidelights and surmounted by multi-paned transoms. There is a wrought iron balustrade on both levels of the portico, and stone steps leading to the first level of the portico. The five bay front elevation, which is 52 feet in width, has six over six sash windows, one on each level of each bay, surmounted by paneled wood lintels and flanked by white wooden shutters. The length of the home's ell is 87 feet. A one-story porch measuring 65 feet runs along the outer ell. A two- story, enclosed porch at the home's rear was an early 20th-century addition and has been removed by the present owners. There were once extensive slave quarters on the grounds of Sycamore Dale's estate which are no longer extant. =Interior= Sycamore Dale's original hand-carved interior woodwork has been preserved. Many of the home's doors are also hand-carved. As a testament to Sycamore Dale's role in the American Civil War, several bullet holes remain in the home's woodwork. The two end chimneys service Sycamore Dale's four large fireplaces. The home is also filled with period furnishings, most of which are Antebellum or Victorian in origin.

The film is based on a biography written by Lennon's half-sister Julia Baird. The film received its US release on 8 October 2010, coinciding with that weekend's celebrations of the 70th anniversary of Lennon's birth (9 October 1940). Plot The drama tells the story of John Lennon's teenage years from 1955 to 1960. John was separated from his mother, Julia Lennon, when he was five. He was brought up by his aunt and uncle, Mimi and George Smith, as their own son. He learns the truth at George's funeral, becomes curious and seeks out his mother. John becomes obsessed with rock 'n' roll music during a visit to Blackpool with Julia. When John is suspended from school, Julia offers to let him stay at her house during school hours so that Mimi won't discover his suspension. Julia teaches John how to play the banjo. Mimi discovers their arrangement and demands that it stop, but John refuses and moves in with Julia. A week later, John overhears an argument between Julia and her husband, and he decides to return to Mimi. John tells Mimi that he wants to start a rock 'n' roll band and she buys him a guitar. John organizes some of his friends into a band which he names the Quarrymen. They play their first gig at a village f√™te, where they play a rendition of \\"Maggie Mae\\". After the show, John meets Paul McCartney, who auditions for the band with the song \\"Twenty Flight Rock\\". Paul is accepted into the band and he and John begin writing songs together. The Quarrymen soon become very popular. John meets Paul's friend, George Harrison, who also auditions. George is accepted into the band as lead guitarist. Julia holds a birthday party for John at her home. After the party, John confronts her about his missing father, Alf Lennon, and asks why Julia gave him up. He also confronts Mimi, who tells him that Julia cheated on Alf and refused to work on the marriage. Alf allowed 5-year-old John to decide whom he wanted to live with, and John chose his father. Alf planned to move with John to New Zealand, but when Julia abandoned the family, John was torn by his devotion to his mother. Without the time or money to legally determine custody, Mimi assumed custodianship of John and raised him as her son. John is upset by this revelation, and leaves in a drunken anger. John moves out to live on his own. Over time, John accepts his past and Julia and Mimi become friendly. When Julia is hit and killed by a car, however, John is consumed by an anger that he cannot overcome. Two years later, he asks Mimi for his passport so that he can travel to Hamburg with his newly formed band, The Beatles. Mimi asks John to call her as soon as he arrives in Hamburg. The film ends with the caption, \\"John phoned Mimi as soon as he arrived in Hamburg...and every week thereafter for the rest of his life.\\" Cast * Aaron Johnson as John Lennon * Kristin Scott Thomas as Mimi Smith * Anne-Marie Duff as Julia Lennon * Thomas Sangster as Paul McCartney * Sam Bell as George Harrison * David Threlfall as George Toogood Smith * Josh Bolt as Pete Shotton * Ophelia Lovibond as Maria Kennedy * James Michael Johnson as Stan Parkes * Angelica Jopling as Julia Baird * Jessie Phoenix Jopling as Jacqueline 'Jackie' Dykins * David Morrissey as Bobby Dykins * Andrew Buchan as Michael Fishwick * James Jack Bentham as Rod Davis * Jack McElhone as Eric Griffiths * Sam Wilmott as Colin Hanton * Christian Bird as Jimmy Tarbuck * Colin Tierney as Alf Lennon * Paul Ritter as John's headmaster Production The film was the directorial debut of conceptual artist/photographer Sam Taylor-Johnson.

It was shot on location in Liverpool, the last house on the right at the end of Sussex Road in Ickenham, Middlesex and at Ealing Studios in West London. Some of the interior school scenes were filmed at Sacred Heart Catholic College in Crosby. Following the announcement of the film, initial media accounts indicated that it would be based on the book Imagine This: Growing Up With My Brother John Lennon by Lennon's half sister Julia Baird. However, the credits for the completed film do not reference either the book or Baird, with sole writing credit accorded to screenwriter Matt Greenhalgh. The director consulted both Paul McCartney and Yoko Ono about the script, with both firmly correcting the depiction of Mimi to be less strict and more loving of John. The film received a National Lottery funding of ¬£1.2 million from the UK Film Council Premier Fund, with an additional ¬£35,500 from its Development Fund to create the script. The film also received a grant from Film4 (the film division of Channel 4). Release The film premiered in the UK on 26 December 2009.

The poem of the act of the mind. >  Analyzing the poem  The poem is divided in two parts by a blank line, and each of the two parts contains a broken line, suggesting quasi-paragraphs. Thus the first division of the poem is five lines with the fourth line broken in two. The second division, the longer one, is lines six through twenty-six, with its quasi-paragraph break at line twenty-three. This typography is a partial clue to the poem's structure. The poem begins and ends with non- sentences: \\"The poem of the mind in the act of finding / What will suffice.\\" And \\"The poem of the act of the mind.\\" Those are a subject and a recapitulation, but not a theme. By lacking a main verb, these lines avoid stating a theme. But more importantly they avoid tying the act of the mind to a time; the act of the mind is not past, present, or future. It is ongoing. These non-sentences also stress that the mind must act, not passively wait for inspiration or intuition. And the mind must seek to find \\"what will suffice.\\" What that says of modern poetry will be addressed metaphorically in the poem, the organizing metaphor being that of a new stage on which the modern poet will perform. The lines of the poem, non-traditional \\"free verse,\\" do not rhyme and are not metrical. They range from ten syllables to fourteen. One striking thing about the sounds of the poem is that three of the lines have weak endings; that is, the final words of these lines have unaccented syllables. The opening line quoted above has a weak ending--\\"The poem of the mind in the act of finding. . . .\\" This dissipation of rhetorical strength is carried further by the poet's not placing the repeated parallel phrases at the beginning of lines, a device called \\"anaphora\\", where they would be much stronger. For instance, immediately after the first break, traditional typography might have arranged the words like this: ::It has to be living, to learn the speech of the place. ::It has to face the men of the time ::And to meet the women of the time. ::It has to think about war ::And it has to find what will suffice. ::It has to construct a new stage. ::It has to be on that stage . . . . (\\"It\\" refers to \\"the poem of the mind.\\") Rearranging the words as they are above makes the rhetorical weakness of the original lines more apparent. \\"Think about war\\" and \\"find what will suffice\\" and the wordiness of the last two lines‚Äîall sap any energy the ideas might have had in the hands of a highly-rhetorical, non-modernist poet like Rudyard Kipling. But the ideas in those original lines need to be uttered by the speaker in order to move the poem forward. As pedestrian as these lines might be, they do get the job done; moreover, they introduce the shaping metaphor of the poem. The modern poem must not only \\"construct a new stage\\" but it must also find words that \\"will suffice\\" without merely repeating outmoded scripts and scenery, hand-me-down forms of expression and ideas. The modern poem must find what will suffice and \\"Make it new.\\" Following that, the words rise from the unemphatic rhetoric to the level of poetry. This passage runs from \\"Like an insatiable actor, slowly and . . .\\" (l. 11) through \\"Beyond which it has no will to rise\\" (l. 23). What does this \\"insatiable actor,\\" this modern poem, do? It has to find what will satisfy human spiritual needs after replacing the past forms of expression and ideas, which have for modernists become mere \\"souvenirs.\\" The reader has a choice of what \\"past\\" the poet is thinking of. It could be earlier forms of poetry, the didacticism of earlier poetry, the decline of communal values, particularly belief in Judeo-Christian religions, or something else. Perhaps the most satisfactory reading is to accept all these possibilities. This core passage describing the modern poem and its speaker ends with these lines: :::: The actor is ::A metaphysician in the dark, twanging ::An instrument, twanging a wiry string that gives ::Sounds passing through sudden rightnesses, wholly ::Containing the mind. . . . :::: (ll. 18-22) In previous ages of belief, the speakers, whether priests or poets, expounded their metaphysics as if coming from a divine afflatus, a revelation, a spiritual light. Stevens' modern poem has to find not a revealed \\"message\\" but poems that satisfy a need that had been fulfilled by traditional poems. For Stevens modern poetry lifted the poet and the reader out of the doldrums of daily life into a brilliant if temporary moment of intense life. For the reader to participate in this aesthetic experience, he or she needed to engage actively in making sense out of the poem. With a difficult and serious poet like Stevens, one way to do this is to find poems in the same book that \\"interinanimate the words\\" of the poem at hand. In this case, Section IV of \\"Variations on a Summer Day,\\" published in Parts of a World (1942), provides this help for \\"Of Modern Poetry\\": ::Words add to the senses. The words for the dazzle ::Of mica, the dithering of grass, ::The Arachne integument of dead trees, ::Are the eye grown larger, more intense. When the speaker says, \\"mica dazzles,\\" the wording requires little verbal imagination of poet or reader. The personifying metaphor, \\"the dithering of grass,\\" requires the reader to participate more actively in making sense of the words. And, finally, the unexpected phrase \\"the Arachne integument of dead trees\\" challenges and rewards the active reader. The image is one of Arachne herself weaving her webs around the dead trees. Surprising word choices and metaphoric images \\"add to the senses\\" and the reader's eye, the mind, does \\"grow larger, more intense.\\" Offering such growth and intensity to the mind is an important way the modern poem finds what will suffice. In addition to the striking word choices and metaphoric images, modern poetry offers unexpected sounds in place of traditional rhymes and meters. The modern poet, that \\"insatiable actor,\\" stands on the new stage \\"twanging a wiry string that gives / Sounds passing through sudden rightnesses.\\" He or she may be playing an unimpressive instrument, but, on the level of prosody, what is important is the \\"sudden rightnesses\\" of the sound of the words. The new music has \\"noble accents / And lucid, inescapable rhythms,\\" that have never been heard before, as Stevens says in Ways of Looking at a Blackbird.\\" The modern poem \\"wholly contains the mind,\\" not just fills it like meaning poured into a waiting vessel, but containing it. The new forms of finding what will suffice are created from the actor's dark metaphysics; the lucid, inescapable rhythms; and images growing out of ordinary things like \\"a man skating, a woman dancing, [or] a woman / Combing.\\" The imagination that creates a modern poem gives its readers what will suffice through the sudden and intense pleasure of seeing the newly imagined in what is real.

Reiss won the Newbery Medal for her account of her experiences as a child during the Holocaust, The Upstairs Room, which was followed by the sequel The Journey Back, both published by HarperCollins. Background In A Hidden Life, Reiss recounts her visit to the home of her youth and the tragedy that followed. She had been 10 years old at the beginning of World War II, and spent nearly three years hiding from the Nazis with a family in Usselo in a rural part of the Netherlands. In the postwar period, she immigrated to the United States. After living there for several years, she decided to visit the family that aided her during the harrowing Nazi years. She made this journey in the summer of 1969, spending nearly two months in the Netherlands with her husband and her two young children. While there, she had to confront her painful memories. But during that time, a worse and more immediate tragedy befell her: her husband returned to America early and committed suicide. A Hidden Life, which Lucy Kavaler calls \\"one of the most moving books\\" she has ever read, is the story of one woman's perseverance through past and present tragedy.

In English heraldry an heraldic heiress is a daughter of deceased man who was entitled to a coat of arms (an armiger) and who carries forward the right to those arms for the benefit of her future male descendants. This carrying forward only applies if she has no brothers or other male relatives alive who would inherit the arms on the death of the holder. A woman is an heiress if *she has no brothers,The Oxford Guide to Heraldry, Thomas Woodcock and John Martin Robinson, Oxford University Press, 1988, 1989, or *all her brothers die without sons or daughters.:A Complete Guide to Heraldry, A. C. Fox-Davies (revised J. P. Brooke-Little), 1949, 1985, Orbis Publishing, London, She is an heiress in her issue if she dies having children and the line of her brothers becomes extinct, that is, all brothers and their children have died. Illegitimate women who are armigers are also regarded as heiresses, even if they also have brothers. In the tradition of English heraldry, which also applies to Wales and pre-1922 Ireland, a man's right to display his coat of arms also applies to his children and his wife (his sons' arms having differencing symbols). His first-born son will inherit the undifferenced (identical) arms on his father's death and pass them on to his descendants. If there is no male line surviving at the armiger's death then each of his surviving daughters becomes a heraldic heiress who holds equally the right of ownership of the arms in trust for her son, who then becomes the absolute owner of the arms. Coat of Arms of Birgitte, Duchess of Gloucester who is a heraldic heiress. Depicting her father's arms imposed over her husband's (Richard, Duke of Gloucester). Marriage of an heraldic heiress If a heraldic heiress marries an armiger, then, rather than impaling her arms on the sinister side of his as would be usual in the marriage of a woman whose father bore arms, she instead displays her father's arms on a small shield over the centre of his shield ‚Äì an \\"escutcheon of pretence\\" ‚Äì for as long as there is no blood male in her extended family. Her husband never owns her inherited arms, and they cannot pass on his death to any of his sons who are not also hers. Heiresses of non-armigerous families In some cases, an heiress of a non-armigerous family may transmit a claim of quarterings from an armigerous family to which she is also an heir (for instance, the only daughter of a family without arms whose mother was an heiress of a family entitled to arms). In this case, her heirs' claim to quarterings through her is dormant, unless and until a petition of arms is granted for the non- armigerous family. Death of husband On the death of her husband, her first-born son inherits arms from both parents and quarters them, creating a new coat to pass to his descendants in the usual way.

Before becoming head of state, Carrillo held a number of public positions, including Judge and Chairman of the Supreme Court of Costa Rica, member of the Legislative Assembly of Costa Rica and member of the Congress of the Federal Republic of Central America. Biography Braulio Carrillo studied law at the University of Le√≥n in Nicaragua. At the early age of 28 years was elected to the legislature for a period of two years, and for a brief period held the position of president of the legislature. In 1834, he was sent as a representative of Costa Rica to the Central American Congress, in El Salvador. Upon the resignation of Costa Rica's head of state Jos√© Rafael Gallegos in 1835, Carrillo was elected to complete the term of Gallegos. Because of their strong character and that the assembly repealed in August of that year the Ambulance Act, the cities of Cartago, Heredia and Alajuela took up arms against the government in mid- September, but were defeated after a civil war lasted a fortnight. Carrillo was a candidate for reelection in 1837, but was defeated by Manuel Aguilar, who was overthrown in 1838 by a cuartelazo. Carrillo again became the Head of State, with absolute powers. He convened a constituent assembly, which, in November, declared that the state was separated from the Federal Republic of Central America, and thus Costa Rica became a sovereign country. The constituent session was suspended in December 1838. In 1841 Carrillo issued the Guarantee Law, which made him head of state for life. There were a number of changes in the social life of Costa Rica, and Carrillo became known as the \\"Architect of the Costa Rican National State\\". He worked to prohibit vagrancy, vice and crime. He greatly boost the development of Costa Rica and introduced order in the Civil Service. His efforts to open a path to communicate with the Central Valley Matina on the Caribbean coast, could not be satisfactorily completed, as the government of Francisco Moraz√°n stopped work when they were well advanced. Due to this effort, the National Park located between the provinces of Lim√≥n and San Jos√© and a highway between San Jos√© and Gu√°piles carries his name today. Braulio Carrillo National Park is also named after him. In 1842 Francisco Moraz√°n, former Federal President Central America, invaded Costa Rica and seized power. Carrillo went into exile and settled in El Salvador, where he was killed in 1845. Achievements of Carrillo's governments * Abolished Ambulance Act and established the capital in San Juan del Murci√©lago, now Tib√°s. * Reduced the number of public holidays in 1836. * Enacted the General Code of the State of Costa Rica in 1841. * Developed a plan to boost agriculture. * Costa Rica left the Central American Federation and assumed full sovereignty. * He organized new Courts of Justice.

The Al Watany Bank of Egypt was founded in May 1980 by several Egyptian businessmen as a joint Stock Company under the provisions of Law 43/1974 with two branches in Cairo. It grew in a promising economy and gradually established a reputation as the leading bank for small and medium- size businesses within the Egyptian market. In August 2007, the National Bank of Kuwait (NBK) acquired a 51% stake in Al Watany for US $516 million. The offer was extended to other shareholders and by October 2007, the National Bank of Kuwait had acquired a total of 93.77% stake in the bank for a cost of over US $900 million by October 2007. The purchase marked the entry of the National Bank of Kuwait into the Egyptian market for the first time and represented a significant stage in the bank's strategy of expansion in the region. The bank intended to triple the number of branches in five years and turn Al Watany into Egypt's third largest retail bank. The Al Watany Bank of Egypt made a net profit of 243.6 million Egyptian pounds (US $44.5 million) in 2007, a 157% increase compared to 2006.

History2000‚Äì2007: Formation and early years= Childhood friends Mpumelelo Mcata and Lindani Buthelezi grew up together in Spruitview, East Rand, where they founded the Blk Jks in 2000. After varying lineups, they were joined by Molefi Makananise (bass) and Tshepang Ramoba (drums) from Soweto and the four played their first gig in Grahamstown in 2005. A year later, they came second in the run-up to represent South Africa at the Global Battle of the Bands competition. After the release of a self-titled EP with five songs, the band began recording songs at SABC studio for a LP titled After Robots. Due to lack of funds and without a record label, these unedited masters were not completed. Instead, in 2007 the Blk Jks released a collector's 10-inch of Lakeside and a series of lo-fi records titled Kilani Sessions. =2008‚Äì2010: Break through and international success= Notwithstanding limited recognition in South Africa, Blk Jks gained international acclaim. American DJ Diplo noticed them while on tour in South Africa and offered to sign the band to his Mad Decent label. While the deal was never closed, Diplo still brought them over to New York City. So, early in 2008 Blk Jks toured the United States and in March appeared on the cover of Fader Magazine. Later that year, they also toured Europe and eventually signed with U.S. indie label Secretly Canadian. Their EP Mystery was recorded at New York's famous Electric Lady Studios. It was first released independently in 2008 and later reissued with Secretly Canadian in 2009. Another tour to the United States included a gig at the South by Southwest festival in Austin. Being signed to a label also allowed the Blk Jks to finally finish their debut album. Produced by Secret Machines' Brandon Curtis, After Robots was released with Secretly Canadian on 8 September 2009. Rolling Stone magazine dubbed the Blk Jks 'Africa's best new band' and rated After Robots three-and-a-half out of five stars; the review states \\"When [the Blk Jks] do it their way, they sound like nothing else\\". Likewise, a review on Pitchfork appreciated After Robots as \\"a hugely ambitious album, with swooping forays into kwaito, ska, reggae, ambience, jazz, prog, and furor.\\" Nonetheless, the review's author complained the Blk Jks would not live up to the hype created by comparisons calling them the \\"African TV on the Radio\\" and he only gave the album a 6.2 rating. Foo Fighter frontman Dave Grohl, on the other hand, declared After Robots his favorite album of 2009. Their international reputation also gained the band more attention nationally. The Mail & Guardian listed the Blk Jks in their yearly feature of eminent 200 Young South Africans in 2009 and 2010. The band was nominated for best album and best English alternative album at the 2010 South African Music Awards, taking home the latter. Blk Jks released their EP Zol! just two days before performing at the 2010 FIFA World Cup Kick- off concert in Soweto's Orlando Stadium on June 10, 2010. The band's track \\"Lakeside\\", taken from After Robots, also featured on the soundtrack EA Sports' FIFA 10 video game. = 2011‚Äìpresent: side projects, lineup changes and collaborations = After their international tours, the Blk Jks kept playing gigs in South Africa. Lindani Buthelezi and the other band members eventually estranged. Buthelezi formed God Sons and Daughter in 2012 and left the Blk Jks shortly after. Mcata and Ramoba started a DJ project called Blk Jks Soundsystem together, as well as, the band Mot√®l Mari with Jo√£o Orrechia. Mcata directed 'Black President,' a documentary film about Zimbabwean artist Kudzanai Chiurai. Ramoba started producing for singer Moonchild Sanelly. The three remaining band members nevertheless kept working together. In 2014, they cast a singer to open for the Foo Fighters on their tour in South Africa and terminated their contract with Secretly Canadian. Two new members also joined the group: trumpeter Tebogo Seitei and Hlubi Vakalisa on saxophone and keyboards. Together with the South African ensemble The Brother Moves On, Blk Jks collaborated in a project called 'Blk Brother' in 2015, something they have done in the past with Malian musician Vieux Farka Tour√© and his band. For the Afropunk Festival Johannesburg 2017, they collaborated with singer Thandiswa Mazwai as 'King Tha' vs. Blk Jks.

Raised in 1944, the unit saw action late in the war against the Japanese during the Aitape‚ÄìWewak campaign taking part in number of long range patrol operations across the Torricelli Range in New Guinea before being used in an amphibious landing near Wewak in May 1945. After the war the unit was disbanded. HistoryFormation= At the beginning of World War II, the Australian Army formed a number of independent companies which later became commando squadrons.Horner 1989, p. 21. Initially these units were formed with the intention of sending them to the Middle East to fight, however, following Japan's entry into the war and the subsequent shift in Australia's strategic focus, these units were employed in a variety of roles in the early stages of the fighting in the Pacific, serving with considerable distinction.Horner 1989, p. 26. In 1943‚Äì44, as part of a re- organisation of the Australian Army to prepare it for jungle warfare, these independent commando squadrons were re-organised into a regimental system underneath the headquarters of the divisional cavalry units of the 6th, 7th and 9th Divisions.Palazzo 2004, pp. 86-101. As a part of this re-organisation, the 2/9th Commando Squadron was raised in January 1944, as part of the 2/6th Cavalry Commando Regiment, attached to the 6th Division. Like the other Australian commando squadrons, it had strength of 17 officers and 253 other ranks.Horner 1989, p. 22. =Aitape‚ÄìWewak campaign= Following the unit's formation, the squadron began training on the Atherton Tablelands in Queensland, before embarking for New Guinea in late 1944. In October 1944, the squadron was one of the first Australian combat units to relieve the American forces at Aitape.Johnston 2008, p. 193. From there, it took part in the Aitape‚ÄìWewak campaign which saw the squadron undertake numerous long-range patrols across the Torricelli Range, as well as being utilised as normal line infantry when required. In this role they were utilised in May 1945 in an amphibious landing at Dove Bay, east of Wewak, as part of Farida Force.Long 1963, p. 350. During this landing, the squadron came ashore in the first wave of the assault force and was instrumental in establishing the beach head. Once the rest of Farida Force had landed, the squadron began patrolling operations along the coast to the west towards the town of Mandi. The patrol was carried out without contacting the Japanese, however, later, as they moved further west past Mandi, they came upon two stragglers.Long 1963, p. 351. The next day, 'B' Troop's positions west of Mandi were mortared by the Japanese, and after a brief period of suppression fire from the beachhead, the troop attacked, taking the track junction and exploiting further westwards. Later in May and into June 1945, the 2/9th were attached to the 19th Brigade and were given responsibility for defending the Bandi Plantation and the vital crossroads at Mandi. In late June, the infiltration of Japanese troops around Boiken threatened the security of the Australian positions and 2/9th along with the rest of the 2/6th Cavalry Commando Regiment were engaged in operations to deal with these threats.Long 1963, p. 380. These raids continued through July and into August, before hostilities finally came to an end on 15 August 1945.Long 1963, p. 381. =Disbandment= After the cessation of hostilities, the unit was slowly reduced as personnel were marched out for demobilisation or for service with the occupation forces in Japan. The remaining members of the squadron returned to Australia in December 1945, and in early 1946 the 2/9th was finally disbanded. During the squadron's service during the war, it lost 12 men killed in action. Members of the 2/9th received the following decorations: one Military Cross, one Military Medal and five Mentions in Despatches.

Coral boulders of the genus Porites, found throughout the archipelago, are the basic materials used for construction of this and other mosques in the country because of its suitability. Although the coral is soft and easily cut to size when wet, it makes sturdy building blocks when dry. The mosque was added to the tentative UNESCO World Heritage cultural list in 2008 as unique examples of sea-culture architecture. Master carpenters of the Mal√© Hukuru Miskiy were Ali Maavadi Kaleyfaanu and Mahmud Maavadi Kaleyfaanu from Kondey, Huvadu.Mauroof Jameel and Yahaya Ahmad (2016). Coral Stone Mosques of Maldives: The Vanishing Legacy of the Indian Ocean, p. 134. ORO Editions. . The calligrapher was Chief Justice Al Faqh Al Qazi Jamaaludheen. It took 2 years to construct the mosque. In terms of artistic excellence and construction technique using only interlocking assembly, it is one of the finest coral stone buildings of the world. Location The mosque is opposite to the Medhu Ziyaaraiy and the Muliaage in the capital Mal√©. The Medhu Ziyaaraiy is the tomb of a Sunni Muslim visitor named Abu al-Barakat Yusuf al-Barbari. Mal√© Friday Mosque was Built in 1656, this is the oldest mosque in Maldives. History The mosque was built in 1658, during the reign of Ibrahim Iskandar I (1648‚Äì1687). It was built over an earlier mosque constructed in 1153 by the first Muslim Sultan of Maldives, Mohamed Bin Abdullah, after his conversion to Islam. Although the older mosque was reportedly refurbished by Ahmed Shihabuddeen in 1338, there are no written records attesting this. In 1656, Iskandar began building a new mosque when the old one became too small to accommodate the increasing number of devotees. Its construction, which took one-and-a-half years, was completed in 1658. Built primarily of coral, the mosque originally had a thatched roof (common during the period). After his 1668 Hajj, Ibrahim I began building a munnaaru (minaret) and a gate at the southern end of the mosque. The minaret, patterned on those at the entrance to Mecca, is surrounded by a 17th-century cemetery with intricately-carved tombstones and mausoleums. In 1904, Muhammad Shamsuddeen III (1902‚Äì1934) replaced the thatched roof and southern gateway with corrugated-iron sheeting. Further renovations were made in 1963, converting the roof supports to teak wood and replacing the corrugated-iron sheeting with aluminium. In 1987 and 1988, an Indian team from the National Research Laboratory for Conservation of Cultural Property and the National Centre for Linguistic and Historical Research in Mal√© did conservation work on the mosque. Maldives' oldest mosque, it has been in continuous use since it was built. The mosque was reportedly built over an ancient temple which predated Islam; the original temple faced the setting sun, rather than Mecca.

Its prayer carpet is angled towards the mosque's northwest corner, so worshippers can face Mecca while they pray. Devotees enter the mosque from either of the two entrance gates that lead to the mosque's dhaala.A small room in a Maldivian Mosque The carpet can accommodate 1,372 people if each devotee occupies one space. The mosque has a reported capacity of 10,700 for Friday prayers. It has intricate carvings, with inscriptions in Quranic script. The mosque, in a walled enclosure, is made of interlocking coral blocks with its hypostyle roof supported by cut-coral columns. With three entrances, the mosque has two prayer halls surrounded by antechambers on three sides. Its vaulted, decorated ceiling is indented in steps. Local master carpenters, known as maavadikaleyge, fashioned the mosque's woodwork, roof and interior, and its wall panels and ceilings have many culturally-significant examples of traditional Maldivian woodcarving and lacquerwork.Xavier Romero-Frias, The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom. Barcelona 1999, The mihrab, with a mimbar (pulpit) at one end, is a large chamber. The main building, used for daily prayers, is divided into three sections: the mihtab (used by the imam to lead the prayers), the medhu miskiy (the mosque's central area) and the fahu miskiy (the rear of the mosque). A long, carved 13th-century panel memorializes the introduction of Islam to Maldives. The mosque's adjoining large, round blue-and-white minaret (built in 1675) resembles a wedding cake, with a wide base similar to a ship's funnel. Built of coral stones, it is braced with metal strips. The minaret is surrounded by a graveyard with carved coral tombstones distinguishing males, females, sultans and their families. Women's tombstones have rounded tops; men's have pointed tops, and inscriptions for royalty are gilt. For family members, small mausoleums with intricately-decorated stone walls were built. This mosque and the other Maldives coral mosques were added to the cultural UNESCO World Heritage tentative list in 2008 for meeting criteria two (use of sea cultures for creating unique architecture), three (a historic cultural tradition with no parallel elsewhere in the world), four (the tongue-in-groove technique shows a highly developed building level for the period) and six (the buildings are associated with both religious and social practices of cultural significance).

The company was founded in 2004 and is based in New York City, United States. In October 2016, Thrillist merged with internet brands The Dodo, NowThis News, and Seeker to form the digital media holding company Group Nine Media. History Ben Lerer (2016) Thrillist was founded in 2004 by Ben Lerer, son of media executive Kenneth Lerer, and Adam Rich, his friend from college. They graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 2003 and moved to New York City. Rich initially served as president, and Ben Robinson served as the Chief Creative Officer. Lerer and Rich sent the first Thrillist e-mail newsletter in 2005 to 600 friends. In early 2017, following layoffs of more than 25 employees, the Thrillist editorial, video, and distribution staffs announced plans to unionize with the Writers Guild of America East. In response, Lerer refused to voluntarily recognize and held anti-union, captive audience meetings despite more than 85% of the editorial staff having signed union cards. In July 2017, Thrillist hired entertainment industry veteran and former MTV and GoPro executive Ocean MacAdams to lead the digital brand. In late September 2018, after more than a year at the bargaining table and a staff walkout, the Thrillist Union and management reached a collective bargaining agreement. The deal included a guaranteed 8.5% raise for all employees in its first year, as well as a salary floor of $50,000/year. \\"This represents a victory not just for the editorial employees of Thrillist, but for our entire industry,\\" the Thrillist Union's bargaining committee said of the contract. \\"Through collective action we've made our workplace better and helped set a standard we hope other digital media shops can follow.\\"  Former business ventures  In May 2010, Thrillist acquired online men's fashion retailer JackThreads. In March 2011, TMG hired Eric Ashman as Chief Financial Officer from The Huffington Post. In 2012, Ashman was charged with committing accounting fraud by the SEC while working as CFO at The Street and was \\"barred from acting as a director or officer of a public company for three years.\\" In February 2012, Lerer announced the creation of the Thrillist Media Group (TMG), which combined Thrillist, deal site Thrillist Rewards, and JackThreads. In August 2012, the media group led a $13 million fundraising round, from OAK, the Pilot Group, and Lerer Ventures. In March 2013, TMG discontinued Thrillist Rewards, citing slow growth, and also launched The Crosby Press, a site designed to market JackThreads products by providing content aimed at a target audience of men in their late teens to early twenties. By May 2015, The Crosby Press had been closed by TMG. In October 2013, TMG launched the tech site Supercompressor, which focused on gear and gadgets for a young male audience. Supercompressor was discontinued as a site in September 2015. In September 2015, TMG announced it raised $54 million in total from European publisher Axel Springer, Oak Investment Partners and SBNY. As part of the transaction, Thrillist separated its businesses, with Thrillist Media group operating the media site, Thrillist, while the e-commerce company operated JackThreads. In October 2016, TMG merged with The Dodo, NowThis News and Seeker to form Group Nine Media. The newly formed holding company received a $100 million strategic investment from Discovery, Inc.

In December 2008, according to Vietnam National Assembly Chairman Nguy·ªÖn Ph√∫ Tr·ªçng, there was still much potential for further economic and commercial co- operation.\\"Nation bolsters ties with Luxembourg\\", Vietnam News Agency, 23 December 2008.  Development Cooperation  Luxembourg pledged EUR35 million in aid for the 2002-05 period.\\"Luxembourg and Vietnam strengthen ties with US$34.7 mln grant\\", Asia Pulse News, 26 September 2002. Covering the period of 2006 to 2010, the second Indicative Cooperation Programme (ICP) aligned Luxembourg's interventions with Vietnam's five-year Socio-Economic Development Plan and supported, with a budget of 50 million EUR, development policies and strategies to achieve the MDGs of the Vietnamese government. Under the overall objective of poverty reduction, the second ICP paid special attention to assisting the poorest provinces and most remote districts. With a budget of 42 million EUR, the third ICP (2011‚Äì2015) has a twofold approach. Poverty reduction remains the main objective, support through programmes in social sectors, namely health and local development. In addition the needs and new challenges faced by a middle income country are addressed through an increased focus on capacity building and human resource development in the banking and finance sector as well as in the vocational training sector including tourism and hospitality. With health, local development and vocational training as priority sectors and with a concentration of activities in the four provinces of Thua Thien Hue, Cao Bang, Bac Kan and Nghe An, the third ICP identifies the same priorities as the previous programme. If the current ICP is a continuity of previous interventions, it constitutes also a consolidation of Luxembourg's support and aims at diversifying relations between the two countries. With the achievement of the status of a middle income country, enhanced international and regional integration and with continued industrialisation, the needs of Vietnam in terms of international assistance have been changing. Luxembourg adapts its development cooperation accordingly and proposes further support in the field of green growth, capacity building in the finance and banking sector as well as in the sector of medical research. As the implementation of these activities can rely on specific expertise based in Luxembourg, they constitute adequate means to a transition to stronger and diversified relations beyond development cooperation between the two countries. The third ICP also takes into consideration recent developments in the field of aid effectiveness. A stronger emphasis on cooperation with the private sector is carried out through interventions in the banking and finance sector whereas local development projects aim at close cooperation with civil society and community based organisations. The ICP also includes a variety of aid modalities such as more programme oriented approaches in the health sector, a delegated cooperation to the health sector support programme implemented by the European Commission and collaboration with UN agencies. 20% of the financial envelope of ICP III is dedicated to multilateral projects targeting the same sectors as the bilateral projects, in order to strengthen synergies and to increase their impact. The Luxembourg development cooperation contributes to the One UN Fund (2012-2016) which directly supports the implementation of the One UN Plan in Vietnam. It also works directly with five UN agencies in Vietnam: UNCTAD, UN Women, UNICEF, ILO and UNESCO. A mid-term evaluation of the current ICP, conducted in June 2014, underlined the important and visible results and impacts reached by Luxembourg's development cooperation and its Vietnamese partners on provincial level, be it in strengthening health care in Cao Bang and Bac Kan provinces, in improving income of vulnerable groups in remote areas of Nghe An province, in providing high standard vocational training for tourism and hospitality students in Hue Tourism College and associated schools and in supporting the Vietnam States Securities Commission in creating a better environment for foreign investors. The evaluation also drew conclusions on the need to further diversify relations between the two countries.http://www.gouvernement.lu/4684612/vietnam  See also  * Foreign relations of Luxembourg * Foreign relations of Vietnam * Vietnam‚ÄìEU relations  References  Further reading  * Luxembourg, Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Vietnam visa from Luxembourg * Official website of Luxembourg Development Cooperation * Homepage of Luxembourg Embassy in Thailand * Facebook page of Luxembourg Embassy to Vietnam Vietnam Category:Bilateral relations of Vietnam ","title":"Luxembourg‚ÄìVietnam relations"},{"id":"21780397","text":"Olaf Johannessen (14 May 1890 - 15 November 1977) was a Norwegian shooter who competed in the early 20th century in rifle shooting.

It is located at 1010, Sainte-Catherine Street West, in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The building is named after the old name of the Square and its southern access is provided by Dorchester Square Street, which connects Peel Street to Metcalfe Street and offers access to a 600-lot parking garage under the building. Architecture A detail of the Italianate style Completed between 1928 and 1930 in the Beaux Arts style, the Dominion Square Building is both a commercial office tower and a shopping mall. The site was formerly occupied by the Erksine Presbyterian Church c. 1866. Designed by the architectural firm of Ross and Macdonald, the building comprises twelve floors above ground and a 'T' shaped shopping concourse. The main entrance primarily serves The Gazette with the escalators leading to a mezzanine looking out onto the ground floor below. The main floor was conceived as an interior shopping arcade at a time when such a notion was highly experimental. Moreover, the original design allowed access to the retail spaces on the ground floor from outside and in. From the third floor up, the facade is twice set back; however, this is not as a result of municipal regulations (only the upper most levels are so regulated), but rather aesthetic choices designed with multiple 'prestige clients' in mind. As such, the twin setbacks form a double comb shape which provides ample sunlight throughout the building while further permitting natural light to pass through the setbacks onto Sainte-Catherine Street below. By doing so, the building maximizes the total amount of available rental space for comparatively small city block. Moreover, multiple offices within have several different views, and recessed corners provide additional corner offices on the 9th and 10th floors. The fa√ßade is of Alabama Rockwood limestone and is described as having an unconventional, yet plentiful Italianate decor. During the last major set of renovations, undertaken in 1989, a second and third floor extension was made, jutting out as a protective arcade with green-glass solarium on top, along the southern side of the building. Current tenants and services Offices of The Gazette. Until late 2019, the principal tenant was The Gazette, which had placed a marquee title holder atop the arcaded entrance along Saint Catherine Street. Current principal tenants include the main Montreal Tourism office (facing Dorchester Square), HMV and a women's wear retailer along Metcalfe Street. Also facing the Square is a branch of the Desjardins Group. In 2009, Global Television Network moved their CKMI-DT station onto the 7th floor. The broadcast station includes a virtual television studio whereby anchors sit in front of a green screen and robotic cameras are controlled from remote cities. Relation to the urban environment The building was conceived as an ingenious solution to the multitude of building height and size regulations imposed by the City of Montreal during the early part of the 20th century. Moreover, it was conceived as an element of a new urban environment, and thus provided not only two levels of interior shopping and two levels of underground parking, but the city's first escalators as well. It was built at a time when there was significant interest (on the part of builders and promoters) to involve all elements of society, not just those who happened to work there. Furthermore, the available shopping space within was further conceived to be accessible from two sides, permitting the entire building to participate in social traffic exchange. Its modern conveniences and amenities, the prestige of location and effective beauty of the design made it an exceptionally important commercial office tower in the era before Modernist Skyscrapers.

C. Gorgas (ID-1365) was a United States Navy troop transport in commission in 1919, named for William C. Gorgas. It was a German ship seized by the US Shipping Board after the US entered World War I. Under charter from 1917 from the Panama Railroad Company, it had carried troops and supplies to Europe. After being used as a troop transport to return troops from Europe in 1919, later that year it was converted back to commercial use as a passenger and freight ship operated by the Panama Railroad Company. In 1941, then owned by Libby, McNeill & Libby, it was chartered by the US War Department to carry troops on the West Coast between Seattle, Washington and ports in Alaska. In January 1945 it was transferred to the War Shipping Board, which later that year transferred the ship to the Soviet Union, an ally in the last years of the war. It was renamed as the SS Losomonov. Construction and early career General W. C. Gorgas was built in 1902 as the commercial passenger-cargo ship SS Prinz Sigismund at Rostock, Germany, by Neptun Aktiengesellschaft, Schiffswerft und Maschinenfabrik for the Hamburg-Amerika Line (HAL). HAL had five of these ships from three builders. The United States Shipping Board seized Prinz Sigismund when the United States entered World War I on the side of the Allies in April 1917. It was renamed SS General W. C. Gorgas in honor of the man who directed sanitation measures to control mosquitoes and the diseases they carried during construction of the Panama Canal. She carried troops and cargo to Europe during the war under charter operations of the Panama Railroad Company of New York City, which operated connecting steamship lines before and after the Panama Canal was built. (This company had started at the time of construction of the Panama Railroad in the mid-19th century, to provide ship connections on both sides of the isthmus, to major cities of the East and West coasts.) Her sisterships, Prinz Eitel Friedrich and Prinz Joachim, were also taken over in 1917 by the shipping board. They were renamed as Otsego (ID-1628) and Moccasin (ID-1322). United States Navy career After the war ended on 11 November 1918, the Shipping Board converted General W. C. Gorgas into a troop transport and transferred her to the U.S. Navy in March 1919 for postwar use in bringing American troops home from Europe. The Navy assigned her the naval registry Identification Number (Id. No.) 1365, and commissioned her on 8 March 1919 as USS General W. C. Gorgas with Lieutenant Commander James Edward Stone, USNRF, in command. Assigned to the Cruiser and Transport Force, General W. C. Gorgas departed New York City on 25 April 1919 for Bordeaux, France, where she embarked United States Army troops and loaded cargo. She returned to the United States, arriving at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on 2 June 1919. She again departed for Bordeaux on 5 June 1919, returning to the United States at Newport News, Virginia, on 4 July 1919. She brought home 2,063 troops from France in these two transatlantic voyages. General W. C. Gorgas was decommissioned on 28 July 1919 and transferred the same day to the United States Shipping Board. Later career Again known as SS General W. C. Gorgas, the ship was returned to commercial service. It was first operated by the Panama Railroad and Shipping Company, through at least 1921.\\"New York, Passenger and Crew Lists (including Castle Garden and Ellis Island), 1820-1957\\", for Mrs. Wm J Mc Cue and Miss Kathleen E.

In 1918 they had bought Otsego, the former Prinz Eitel Friedrich. They used both ships with success for supplying their fish cannery factories in Alaska. Both former German steamers stayed in commercial service on the West Coast until World War II. In November 1941, the Gorgas was chartered by the United States Department of War for U.S. Army troop transport service between Seattle, Washington, and the Territory of Alaska as the United States Army Transport (USAT) General W. C. Gorgas. She continued her Army troopship duties to Alaska until transferred to the War Shipping Administration at Seattle in January 1945. In 1945, the War Shipping Administration transferred General W. C. Gorgas to the Soviet Union, an ally during the war. She was renamed as SS Mikhail Lomonosov.

A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which any two individuals of the appropriate sexes or mating types can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. Other ways of defining species include their karyotype, DNA sequence, morphology, behaviour or ecological niche. In addition, paleontologists use the concept of the chronospecies since fossil reproduction cannot be examined. The total number of species is estimated to be between 8 and 8.7 million. However the vast majority of them are not studied or documented and it may take over 1000 years to fully catalogue them all. All species (except viruses) are given a two-part name, a \\"binomial\\". The first part of a binomial is the genus to which the species belongs. The second part is called the specific name or the specific epithet (in botanical nomenclature, also sometimes in zoological nomenclature). For example, Boa constrictor is one of four species of the genus Boa, with constrictor being the species‚Äô epithet. While the definitions given above may seem adequate, when looked at more closely they represent problematic species concepts. For example, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear with hybridisation, in a species complex of hundreds of similar microspecies, and in a ring species. Also, among organisms that reproduce only asexually, the concept of a reproductive species breaks down, and each clone is potentially a microspecies. Though none of these are entirely satisfactory definitions, scientists and conservationists need a species definition which allows them to work, regardless of the theoretical difficulties. If species were fixed and clearly distinct from one another, there would be no problem, but evolutionary processes cause species to change continually, and to grade into one another. Species were seen from the time of Aristotle until the 18th century as fixed categories that could be arranged in a hierarchy, the great chain of being. In the 19th century, biologists grasped that species could evolve given sufficient time. Charles Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species explained how species could arise by natural selection. That understanding was greatly extended in the 20th century through genetics and population ecology. Genetic variability arises from mutations and recombination, while organisms themselves are mobile, leading to geographical isolation and genetic drift with varying selection pressures. Genes can sometimes be exchanged between species by horizontal gene transfer; new species can arise rapidly through hybridisation and polyploidy; and species may become extinct for a variety of reasons. Viruses are a special case, driven by a balance of mutation and selection, and can be treated as quasispecies. Definition Biologists and taxonomists have made many attempts to define species, beginning from morphology and moving towards genetics. Early taxonomists such as Linnaeus had no option but to describe what they saw: this was later formalised as the typological or morphological species concept. Ernst Mayr emphasised reproductive isolation, but this, like other species concepts, is hard or even impossible to test. Later biologists have tried to refine Mayr's definition with the recognition and cohesion concepts, among others. Many of the concepts are quite similar or overlap, so they are not easy to count: the biologist R. L. Mayden recorded about 24 concepts, and the philosopher of science John Wilkins counted 26. Wilkins further grouped the species concepts into seven basic kinds of concepts: (1) agamospecies for asexual organisms (2) biospecies for reproductively isolated sexual organisms (3) ecospecies based on ecological niches (4) evolutionary species based on lineage (5) genetic species based on gene pool (6) morphospecies based on form or phenotype and (7) taxonomic species, a species as determined by a taxonomist. =Typological or morphological species= All adult Eurasian blue tits share the same coloration, unmistakably identifying the morphospecies. A typological species is a group of organisms in which individuals conform to certain fixed properties (a type), so that even pre-literate people often recognise the same taxon as do modern taxonomists. The clusters of variations or phenotypes within specimens (such as longer or shorter tails) would differentiate the species. This method was used as a \\"classical\\" method of determining species, such as with Linnaeus early in evolutionary theory. However, different phenotypes are not necessarily different species (e.g. a four-winged Drosophila born to a two-winged mother is not a different species). Species named in this manner are called morphospecies. In the 1970s, Robert R. Sokal, Theodore J. Crovello and Peter Sneath proposed a variation on this, a phenetic species, defined as a set of organisms with a similar phenotype to each other, but a different phenotype from other sets of organisms.Claridge et al.:404. It differs from the morphological species concept in including a numerical measure of distance or similarity to cluster entities based on multivariate comparisons of a reasonably large number of phenotypic traits. =Recognition and cohesion species= A mate-recognition species is a group of sexually reproducing organisms that recognize one another as potential mates.Claridge et al.:408‚Äì409. Expanding on this to allow for post-mating isolation, a cohesion species is the most inclusive population of individuals having the potential for phenotypic cohesion through intrinsic cohesion mechanisms; no matter whether populations can hybridize successfully, they are still distinct cohesion species if the amount of hybridization is insufficient to completely mix their respective gene pools. A further development of the recognition concept is provided by the biosemiotic concept of species. =Genetic similarity and barcode species= A region of the gene for the cytochrome c oxidase enzyme is used to distinguish species in the Barcode of Life Data Systems database. In microbiology, genes can move freely even between distantly related bacteria, possibly extending to the whole bacterial domain. As a rule of thumb, microbiologists have assumed that kinds of Bacteria or Archaea with 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences more similar than 97% to each other need to be checked by DNA-DNA hybridisation to decide if they belong to the same species or not. This concept was narrowed in 2006 to a similarity of 98.7%. DNA-DNA hybridisation is outdated, and results have sometimes led to misleading conclusions about species, as with the pomarine and great skua. Modern approaches compare sequence similarity using computational methods. DNA barcoding has been proposed as a way to distinguish species suitable even for non-specialists to use. The so-called barcode is a region of mitochondrial DNA within the gene for cytochrome c oxidase. A database, Barcode of Life Data Systems (BOLD) contains DNA barcode sequences from over 190,000 species. However, scientists such as Rob DeSalle have expressed concern that classical taxonomy and DNA barcoding, which they consider a misnomer, need to be reconciled, as they delimit species differently. Genetic introgression mediated by endosymbionts and other vectors can further make barcodes ineffective in the identification of species. =Phylogenetic, cladistic, or evolutionary species = The cladistic or phylogenetic species concept is that a species is the smallest lineage which is distinguished by a unique set of either genetic or morphological traits. No claim is made about reproductive isolation, making the concept useful also in palaeontology where only fossil evidence is available. A phylogenetic or cladistic species is an evolutionarily divergent lineage, one that has maintained its hereditary integrity through time and space.Wheeler, Quentin D.; Platnick, Norman I. 2000. The phylogenetic species concept (sensu Wheeler & Platnick). In: Wheeler, Q. D.; Meier, R., editors. Species concepts and phylogenetic theory: a debate. New York: Columbia University Press. pp. 55‚Äì69.. A cladistic species is the smallest group of populations that can be distinguished by a unique set of morphological or genetic traits. Molecular markers may be used to determine genetic similarities in the nuclear or mitochondrial DNA of various species. For example, in a study done on fungi, studying the nucleotide characters using cladistic species produced the most accurate results in recognising the numerous fungi species of all the concepts studied. Versions of the phylogenetic species concept may emphasize monophyly or diagnosability. The concept may lead to splitting of existing species, for example in Bovidae, by recognising old subspecies as species, despite the fact that there are no reproductive barriers, and populations may inter-grade morphologically.Groves, C.; Grubb, P. 2011. Ungulate taxonomy. Baltimore, MD: The Johns Hopkins University Press. Others have called this approach taxonomic inflation, diluting the species concept and making taxonomy unstable. Yet others defend this approach, considering \\"taxonomic inflation\\" pejorative and labelling the opposing view as \\"taxonomic conservatism\\"; claiming it is politically expedient to split species and recognise smaller populations at the species level, because this means they can more easily be included as endangered in the IUCN red list and can attract conservation legislation and funding. Unlike the biological species concept, a cladistic species does not rely on reproductive isolation, so it is independent of processes that are integral in other concepts. It works for asexual lineages. However, it does not work in every situation, and may require more than one polymorphic locus to give an accurate result. An evolutionary species, suggested by George Gaylord Simpson in 1951, is \\"an entity composed of organisms which maintains its identity from other such entities through time and over space, and which has its own independent evolutionary fate and historical tendencies\\". This differs from the biological species concept in embodying persistence over time. Wiley and Mayden state that they see the evolutionary species concept as \\"identical\\" to Willi Hennig's species-as-lineages concept, and assert that the biological species concept, \\"the several versions\\" of the phylogenetic species concept, and the idea that species are of the same kind as higher taxa are not suitable for biodiversity studies (with the intention of estimating the number of species accurately). They further suggest that the concept works for both asexual and sexually-reproducing species.Wheeler, pp. 70‚Äì92, 146‚Äì160, 198‚Äì208 =Ecological species= An ecological species is a set of organisms adapted to a particular set of resources, called a niche, in the environment. According to this concept, populations form the discrete phenetic clusters that we recognise as species because the ecological and evolutionary processes controlling how resources are divided up tend to produce those clusters. =Genetic species= A genetic species as defined by Robert Baker and Robert Bradley is a set of genetically isolated interbreeding populations. This is similar to Mayr's Biological Species Concept, but stresses genetic rather than reproductive isolation. In the 21st century, a genetic species can be established by comparing DNA sequences, but other methods were available earlier, such as comparing karyotypes (sets of chromosomes) and allozymes (enzyme variants). =Evolutionarily significant unit= An evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) or \\"wildlife species\\" is a population of organisms considered distinct for purposes of conservation. =Chronospecies= A chronospecies is defined in a single lineage (solid line) whose morphology changes with time. At some point, palaeontologists judge that enough change has occurred that two species (A and B), separated in time and anatomy, once existed. In palaeontology, with only comparative anatomy (morphology) from fossils as evidence, the concept of a chronospecies can be applied. During anagenesis (evolution, not necessarily involving branching), palaeontologists seek to identify a sequence of species, each one derived from the phyletically extinct one before through continuous, slow and more or less uniform change. In such a time sequence, palaeontologists assess how much change is required for a morphologically distinct form to be considered a different species from its ancestors. =Viral quasispecies= Viruses have enormous populations, are doubtfully living since they consist of little more than a string of DNA or RNA in a protein coat, and mutate rapidly. All of these factors make conventional species concepts largely inapplicable. A viral quasispecies is a group of genotypes related by similar mutations, competing within a highly mutagenic environment, and hence governed by a mutation‚Äìselection balance. It is predicted that a viral quasispecies at a low but evolutionarily neutral and highly connected (that is, flat) region in the fitness landscape will outcompete a quasispecies located at a higher but narrower fitness peak in which the surrounding mutants are unfit, \\"the quasispecies effect\\" or the \\"survival of the flattest\\". There is no suggestion that a viral quasispecies resembles a traditional biological species. Taxonomy and naming A cougar, mountain lion, panther, or puma, among other common names: its scientific name is Puma concolor. =Common and scientific names= The commonly used names for kinds of organisms are often ambiguous: \\"cat\\" could mean the domestic cat, Felis catus, or the cat family, Felidae. Another problem with common names is that they often vary from place to place, so that puma, cougar, catamount, panther, painter and mountain lion all mean Puma concolor in various parts of America, while \\"panther\\" may also mean the jaguar (Panthera onca) of Latin America or the leopard (Panthera pardus) of Africa and Asia. In contrast, the scientific names of species are chosen to be unique and universal; they are in two parts used together: the genus as in Puma, and the specific epithet as in concolor. =Species description= type specimen (holotype) of Lacerta plica, described by Linnaeus in 1758 A species is given a taxonomic name when a type specimen is described formally, in a publication that assigns it a unique scientific name. The description typically provides means for identifying the new species, differentiating it from other previously described and related or confusable species and provides a validly published name (in botany) or an available name (in zoology) when the paper is accepted for publication. The type material is usually held in a permanent repository, often the research collection of a major museum or university, that allows independent verification and the means to compare specimens.One example of an abstract of an article naming a new species can be found at Describers of new species are asked to choose names that, in the words of the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, are \\"appropriate, compact, euphonious, memorable, and do not cause offence\\". =Abbreviations= Books and articles sometimes intentionally do not identify species fully and use the abbreviation \\"sp.\\" in the singular or \\"spp.\\" (standing for species pluralis, the Latin for multiple species) in the plural in place of the specific name or epithet (e.g. Canis sp.). This commonly occurs when authors are confident that some individuals belong to a particular genus but are not sure to which exact species they belong, as is common in paleontology. Authors may also use \\"spp.\\" as a short way of saying that something applies to many species within a genus, but not to all. If scientists mean that something applies to all species within a genus, they use the genus name without the specific name or epithet. The names of genera and species are usually printed in italics. However, abbreviations such as \\"sp.\\" should not be italicised. When a species' identity is not clear, a specialist may use \\"cf.\\" before the epithet to indicate that confirmation is required. The abbreviations \\"nr.\\" (near) or \\"aff.\\" (affine) may be used when the identity is unclear but when the species appears to be similar to the species mentioned after. =Identification codes= With the rise of online databases, codes have been devised to provide identifiers for species that are already defined, including: * National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) employs a numeric 'taxid' or Taxonomy identifier, a \\"stable unique identifier\\", e.g., the taxid of Homo sapiens is 9606. * Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) employs a three- or four-letter code for a limited number of organisms; in this code, for example, H. sapiens is simply hsa. * UniProt employs an \\"organism mnemonic\\" of not more than five alphanumeric characters, e.g., HUMAN for H. sapiens. * Integrated Taxonomic Information System (ITIS) provides a unique number for each species. The LSID for Homo sapiens is urn:lsid:catalogueoflife.org:taxon:4da6736d-d35f-11e6-9d3f-bc764e092680:col20170225. =Lumping and splitting= The naming of a particular species, including which genus (and higher taxa) it is placed in, is a hypothesis about the evolutionary relationships and distinguishability of that group of organisms. As further information comes to hand, the hypothesis may be confirmed or refuted. Sometimes, especially in the past when communication was more difficult, taxonomists working in isolation have given two distinct names to individual organisms later identified as the same species. When two named species are discovered to be of the same species, the older species name is given priority and usually retained, and the newer name considered as a junior synonym, a process called synonymisation. Dividing a taxon into multiple, often new, taxa is called splitting. Taxonomists are often referred to as \\"lumpers\\" or \\"splitters\\" by their colleagues, depending on their personal approach to recognising differences or commonalities between organisms. =Broad and narrow senses= The nomenclatural codes that guide the naming of species, including the ICZN for animals and the ICN for plants, do not make rules for defining the boundaries of the species. Research can change the boundaries, also known as circumscription, based on new evidence. Species may then need to be distinguished by the boundary definitions used, and in such cases the names may be qualified with sensu stricto (\\"in the narrow sense\\") to denote usage in the exact meaning given by an author such as the person who named the species, while the antonym sensu lato (\\"in the broad sense\\") denotes a wider usage, for instance including other subspecies. Other abbreviations such as \\"auct.\\" (\\"author\\"), and qualifiers such as \\"non\\" (\\"not\\") may be used to further clarify the sense in which the specified authors delineated or described the species. Mayr's biological species concept Ernst Mayr proposed the widely used Biological Species Concept of reproductive isolation in 1942. Most modern textbooks make use of Ernst Mayr's 1942 definition,Wheeler, pp. 17‚Äì29 known as the Biological Species Concept as a basis for further discussion on the definition of species. It is also called a reproductive or isolation concept. This defines a species as It has been argued that this definition is a natural consequence of the effect of sexual reproduction on the dynamics of natural selection. Mayr's use of the adjective \\"potentially\\" has been a point of debate; some interpretations exclude unusual or artificial matings that occur only in captivity, or that involve animals capable of mating but that do not normally do so in the wild. The species problem It is difficult to define a species in a way that applies to all organisms. The debate about species delimitation is called the species problem. The problem was recognized even in 1859, when Darwin wrote in On the Origin of Species: =When Mayr's concept breaks down= Palaeontologists are limited to morphological evidence when deciding whether fossil life-forms like these Inoceramus bivalves formed a separate species. A simple textbook definition, following Mayr's concept, works well for most multi-celled organisms, but breaks down in several situations: * When organisms reproduce asexually, as in single-celled organisms such as bacteria and other prokaryotes, and parthenogenetic or apomictic multi-celled organisms. The term quasispecies is sometimes used for rapidly mutating entities like viruses. * When scientists do not know whether two morphologically similar groups of organisms are capable of interbreeding; this is the case with all extinct life-forms in palaeontology, as breeding experiments are not possible. * When hybridisation permits substantial gene flow between species. * In ring species, when members of adjacent populations in a widely continuous distribution range interbreed successfully but members of more distant populations do not. Species identification is made difficult by discordance between molecular and morphological investigations; these can be categorized as two types: (i) one morphology, multiple lineages (e.g. morphological convergence, cryptic species) and (ii) one lineage, multiple morphologies (e.g. phenotypic plasticity, multiple life-cycle stages). In addition, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) makes it difficult to define a species. All species definitions assume that an organism acquires its genes from one or two parents very like the \\"daughter\\" organism, but that is not what happens in HGT. There is strong evidence of HGT between very dissimilar groups of prokaryotes, and at least occasionally between dissimilar groups of eukaryotes, including some crustaceans and echinoderms. The evolutionary biologist James Mallet concludes that =Aggregates of microspecies= The species concept is further weakened by the existence of microspecies, groups of organisms, including many plants, with very little genetic variability, usually forming species aggregates. For example, the dandelion Taraxacum officinale and the blackberry Rubus fruticosus are aggregates with many microspecies‚Äîperhaps 400 in the case of the blackberry and over 200 in the dandelion, complicated by hybridisation, apomixis and polyploidy, making gene flow between populations difficult to determine, and their taxonomy debatable. Species complexes occur in insects such as Heliconius butterflies, vertebrates such as Hypsiboas treefrogs, and fungi such as the fly agaric. File:Ripe, ripening, and green blackberries.jpgBlackberries belong to any of hundreds of microspecies of the Rubus fruticosus species aggregate. File:Heliconius mimicry.pngThe butterfly genus Heliconius contains many similar species. File:Systematics-of-treefrogs-of-the-Hypsiboas-calcaratus-and-Hypsiboas- fasciatus-species-complex-(Anura-ZooKeys-370-001-g009.jpgThe Hypsiboas calcaratus‚Äìfasciatus species complex contains at least six species of treefrog. =Hybridisation= Natural hybridisation presents a challenge to the concept of a reproductively isolated species, as fertile hybrids permit gene flow between two populations. For example, the carrion crow Corvus corone and the hooded crow Corvus cornix appear and are classified as separate species, yet they hybridise freely where their geographical ranges overlap. File:Kr√§he_65(loz) (cropped).JPGCarrion crow File:20151221 hybrid Corvus corone √ó Corvus cornix.jpgHybrid with dark belly, dark gray nape File:Corvus cornix (Scops).jpgHybrid with dark belly File:Wrona_Siwa.jpgHooded crow = Ring species = A ring species is a connected series of neighbouring populations, each of which can sexually interbreed with adjacent related populations, but for which there exist at least two \\"end\\" populations in the series, which are too distantly related to interbreed, though there is a potential gene flow between each \\"linked\\" population. Such non-breeding, though genetically connected, \\"end\\" populations may co-exist in the same region thus closing the ring. Ring species thus present a difficulty for any species concept that relies on reproductive isolation. However, ring species are at best rare. Proposed examples include the herring gull-lesser black- backed gull complex around the North pole, the Ensatina eschscholtzii group of 19 populations of salamanders in America, and the greenish warbler in Asia, but many so-called ring species have turned out to be the result of misclassification leading to questions on whether there really are any ring species. File:Ring species seagull.svgSeven \\"species\\" of Larus gulls interbreed in a ring around the Arctic. File:PT05 ubt.jpegOpposite ends of the ring: a herring gull (Larus argentatus) (front) and a lesser black-backed gull (Larus fuscus) in Norway File:Greenish Warbler Sikkim India 11.05.2014.jpgA greenish warbler, Phylloscopus trochiloides File:Greenish warbler ring.svgPresumed evolution of five \\"species\\" of greenish warblers around Himalayas Change Species are subject to change, whether by evolving into new species, exchanging genes with other species, merging with other species or by becoming extinct. = Speciation = The evolutionary process by which biological populations evolve to become distinct or reproductively isolated as species is called speciation. Charles Darwin was the first to describe the role of natural selection in speciation in his 1859 book The Origin of Species. Speciation depends on a measure of reproductive isolation, a reduced gene flow. This occurs most easily in allopatric speciation, where populations are separated geographically and can diverge gradually as mutations accumulate. Reproductive isolation is threatened by hybridisation, but this can be selected against once a pair of populations have incompatible alleles of the same gene, as described in the Bateson‚ÄìDobzhansky‚ÄìMuller model. A different mechanism, phyletic speciation, involves one lineage gradually changing over time into a new and distinct form, without increasing the number of resultant species. = Exchange of genes between species = Horizontal gene transfers between widely separated species complicate the phylogeny of bacteria. Horizontal gene transfer between organisms of different species, either through hybridisation, antigenic shift, or reassortment, is sometimes an important source of genetic variation. Viruses can transfer genes between species. Bacteria can exchange plasmids with bacteria of other species, including some apparently distantly related ones in different phylogenetic domains, making analysis of their relationships difficult, and weakening the concept of a bacterial species. Louis-Marie Bobay and Howard Ochman suggest, based on analysis of the genomes of many types of bacteria, that they can often be grouped \\"into communities that regularly swap genes\\", in much the same way that plants and animals can be grouped into reproductively isolated breeding populations. Bacteria may thus form species, analogous to Mayr's biological species concept, consisting of asexually reproducing populations that exchange genes by homologous recombination. =Extinction= A species is extinct when the last individual of that species dies, but it may be functionally extinct well before that moment. It is estimated that over 99 percent of all species that ever lived on Earth, some five billion species, are now extinct. Some of these were in mass extinctions such as those at the ends of the Permian, Triassic and Cretaceous periods. Mass extinctions had a variety of causes including volcanic activity, climate change, and changes in oceanic and atmospheric chemistry, and they in turn had major effects on Earth's ecology, atmosphere, land surface and waters. Another form of extinction is through the assimilation of one species by another through hybridization. The resulting single species has been termed as a \\"compilospecies\\". Practical implications Biologists and conservationists need to categorise and identify organisms in the course of their work. Difficulty assigning organisms reliably to a species constitutes a threat to the validity of research results, for example making measurements of how abundant a species is in an ecosystem moot. Surveys using a phylogenetic species concept reported 48% more species and accordingly smaller populations and ranges than those using nonphylogenetic concepts; this was termed \\"taxonomic inflation\\", which could cause a false appearance of change to the number of endangered species and consequent political and practical difficulties. Some observers claim that there is an inherent conflict between the desire to understand the processes of speciation and the need to identify and to categorise. Conservation laws in many countries make special provisions to prevent species from going extinct. Hybridization zones between two species, one that is protected and one that is not, have sometimes led to conflicts between lawmakers, land owners and conservationists. One of the classic cases in North America is that of the protected northern spotted owl which hybridizes with the unprotected California spotted owl and the barred owl; this has led to legal debates. It has been argued that the species problem is created by the varied uses of the concept of species, and that the solution is to abandon it and all other taxonomic ranks, and use unranked monophyletic groups instead. It has been argued, too, that since species are not comparable, counting them is not a valid measure of biodiversity; alternative measures of phylogenetic biodiversity have been proposed. HistoryClassical forms= In his biology, Aristotle used the term Œ≥Œ≠ŒΩŒøœÇ (g√©nos) to mean a kind, such as a bird or fish, and Œµ·º∂Œ¥ŒøœÇ (eidos) to mean a specific form within a kind, such as (within the birds) the crane, eagle, crow, or sparrow. These terms were translated into Latin as \\"genus\\" and \\"species\\", though they do not correspond to the Linnean terms thus named; today the birds are a class, the cranes are a family, and the crows a genus. A kind was distinguished by its attributes; for instance, a bird has feathers, a beak, wings, a hard-shelled egg, and warm blood. A form was distinguished by being shared by all its members, the young inheriting any variations they might have from their parents. Aristotle believed all kinds and forms to be distinct and unchanging. His approach remained influential until the Renaissance. =Fixed species= John Ray believed that species breed true and do not change, even though variations exist. When observers in the Early Modern period began to develop systems of organization for living things, they placed each kind of animal or plant into a context. Many of these early delineation schemes would now be considered whimsical: schemes included consanguinity based on colour (all plants with yellow flowers) or behaviour (snakes, scorpions and certain biting ants). John Ray, an English naturalist, was the first to attempt a biological definition of species in 1686, as follows: Carl Linnaeus created the binomial system for naming species. In the 18th century, the Swedish scientist Carl Linnaeus classified organisms according to shared physical characteristics, and not simply based upon differences. He established the idea of a taxonomic hierarchy of classification based upon observable characteristics and intended to reflect natural relationships. At the time, however, it was still widely believed that there was no organic connection between species, no matter how similar they appeared. This view was influenced by European scholarly and religious education, which held that the categories of life are dictated by God, forming an Aristotelian hierarchy, the scala naturae or great chain of being. However, whether or not it was supposed to be fixed, the scala (a ladder) inherently implied the possibility of climbing. = Mutability = In viewing evidence of hybridisation, Linnaeus recognised that species were not fixed and could change; he did not consider that new species could emerge and maintained a view of divinely fixed species that may alter through processes of hybridisation or acclimatisation. By the 19th century, naturalists understood that species could change form over time, and that the history of the planet provided enough time for major changes. Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, in his 1809 Zoological Philosophy, described the transmutation of species, proposing that a species could change over time, in a radical departure from Aristotelian thinking. In 1859, Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace provided a compelling account of evolution and the formation of new species. Darwin argued that it was populations that evolved, not individuals, by natural selection from naturally occurring variation among individuals. This required a new definition of species. Darwin concluded that species are what they appear to be: ideas, provisionally useful for naming groups of interacting individuals, writing:  See also  * Cline * Encyclopedia of Life * Endangered species * Global biodiversity * Lists of animal species * Systematics * :Category:Lists of animal species * :Category:Lists of plant species  References  Citations  Cited sources =   External links  * Barcoding of species * Catalogue of Life * European Species Names in Linnaean, Czech, English, German and French * Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry: Species * VisualTaxa * Wikispecies ‚Äì The free species directory that anyone can edit from the Wikimedia Foundation Category:Biological concepts Category:Biology terminology Species 1rank24 rank24 Category:Bacterial nomenclature ","title":"Species"},{"id":"21780453","text":"Dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) are stem cells present in the dental pulp, which is the soft living tissue within teeth. They are pluripotent, as they can form embryoid body-like structures (EBs) in vitro and teratoma-like structures that contained tissues derived from all three embryonic germ layers when injected in nude mice. DPSCs can differentiate in vitro into tissues that have similar characteristics to mesoderm, endoderm and ectoderm layers. DPSCs were found to be able to differentiate into adipocytes and neural-like cells. These cells can be obtained from postnatal teeth, wisdom teeth, and deciduous teeth, providing researchers with a non-invasive method of extracting stem cells. As a result, DPSCs have been thought of as an extremely promising source of cells used in endogenous tissue engineering. Studies have shown that the proliferation rate of DPSCs is 30% higher than in other stem cells, such as bone marrow stromal stem cells (BMSSCs). These characteristics of DPSCs are mainly due to the fact that they exhibit elevated amounts of cell cycling molecules, one being cyclin-dependent kinase 6 (CDK6), present in the dental pulp tissue. Additionally, DPSCs have displayed lower immunogenicity than MSCs. Atari et al., established a protocol for isolating and identifying the subpopulations of dental pulp pluripotent-like stem cells (DPPSC). These cells are SSEA4+, OCT3/4+, NANOG+, SOX2+, LIN28+, CD13+, CD105+, CD34-, CD45-, CD90+, CD29+, CD73+, STRO1+, and CD146-, and they show genetic stability in vitro based on genomic analysis with a newly described CGH technique.  Role in regenerative dentistry The human mouth is vulnerable to craniofacial defects, microbial attacks, and traumatic damages. Although preclinical and clinical partial regeneration of dental tissues has shown success, the creation of an entire tooth from DPSCs is not yet possible. = Distraction osteogenesis = Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is a method of bone regeneration, commonly used in the surgical repair of large craniofacial defects. The area in which the defect is present is purposely broken in surgery, allowed to heal briefly, and then the bone segments are gradually separated until the area has healed satisfactorily. A study conducted in 2018 by Song et al. found that DPSCs transfected with Sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) in rabbits were more effective in promoting bone formation during DO. SIRT1-modified DPSCs accumulated significantly higher levels of calcium after osteogenic differentiation in vitro, suggesting the potential role of DPSCs in enhancing the efficiency of DO. = Calcined tooth powder = Calcine tooth powder (CTP) is obtained by burning extracted teeth, destroying the potential infection- causing material within the tooth, resulting in tooth ash Tooth ash has been shown to promote bone repair. Although recent studies have shown that calcine tooth powder- culture media (CTP-CM) does not affect proliferation, they have shown that CTP-CM has significantly increased levels of osteo/odontogenic markers in DPSCs.  Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth  Stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) are similar to DPSCs in the sense that they are both derived from the dental pulp, but SHED are derived from baby teeth, whereas DPSCs are derived from adult teeth. SHED are a population of multipotent stem cells that are easily collected, as deciduous teeth either shed naturally or are physically removed in order to facilitate the proper growth of permanent teeth. These cells can differentiate into osteocytes, adipocytes, odontoblast, and chondrocytes in vitro. Recent work has shown the enhanced proliferative capabilities of SHED when compared with that of dental pulp stem cells. = Potential therapeutic use of SHED = Studies have shown that under the influence of oxidative stress, SHED (OST- SHED) displayed increased levels of neuronal protection. The properties of these cells exhibited in this study suggest that OST-SHED could potentially prevent of oxidative stress-induced brain damage and could aid in the development of therapeutic tools for neurodegenerative disorders. After SHED injection into Goto-Kakizaki rats, type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) was ameliorated, suggesting the potential for SHED in T2DM therapies. Recent studies have also shown that the administration of SHED in mice ameliorated the T cell immune imbalance in allergic rhinitis (AR), suggesting the cells' potential in future AR treatments. After introducing SHED, mice experienced reduced nasal symptoms and decreased inflammatory infiltration. SHEDs were found to inhibit the proliferation of T lymphocytes, increase levels of an anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, and decrease the levels of a pro- inflammatory cytokine, IL-4. Additionally, SHED can potentially treat liver cirrhosis. In a study conducted by Yokoyama et al. (2019), SHED were differentiated into hepatic stellate cells. They found that when hepatic cells derived from SHED were transplanted into the liver of rats, liver fibrosis was terminated, allowing for the healing of the liver structure.

In 1847 he was admitted in the College of the Propaganda in Rome where he remained till 1856 when he received the Doctorate in Theology. He was ordained deacon on 8 March 1856 and priest on 16 March 1856. Behnam Benni served as priest for some years until his appointment as bishop of Mosul by Patriarch Ignatius Antony I Samheri who consecrated him bishop on 9 March 1862. His first years at Mosul were saddened by the fight with Syriac Orthodox for the ownership of the churches in the town. In 1870 Benni was in Rome to participate to the First Vatican Council where he, in opposition to the Melkite patriarch Gregory II Youssef, spoke to make uniform the ecclesiastical discipline in the East and in the West and in favor of the papal infallibility. He was one of the main redactors of the text approved by the synod of Charfet in 1888 that made mandatory the clergy's celibacy in the Syriac Catholic Church. After the death of patriarch Ignatius George V Shelhot on 8 December 1891, Behnam Benni, who was the older prelate by consecration, was appointed Locum tenens of the Patriarchate. On 12 October 1893 he was unanimously elected Patriarch, confirmed the same day by Pope Leo XIII by means of a telegraph message and enthroned Sunday 15 October 1893. He was formally confirmed by the pope in the consistory of 18 May 1894.

Biography Born Charles Burns, in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire in 1957, Burns became a guitarist on the London punk and new wave scene of the mid 1970s. As well as forming Fingerprintz with fellow Coatbridge local Jimme O'Neill, Burns played guitar in Adam Ant's backing band during 1982‚Äì1984 together with Fingerprintz drummer Bogdan Wiczling. Fingerprintz were recognised in retrospect as influential, but failed to gain any real commercial success in the UK.The Herald (UK) feature article on Burns In 1985, Burns and Jimme O'Neill formed The Silencers, although Burns' health became an issue during the recording of the first album, after he suffered a brain hemorrhage. Burns was back in the studio recording six weeks later despite the fact that he was still re-learning how to read. The Silencers received critical comparisons to Simple Minds and U2. A high point for the band was a support slot on a Squeeze tour which culminated in a gig at Madison Square Garden in Manhattan. The Silencers had a European hit with \\"Bulletproof Heart\\". However the single, written by O'Neill in the Fingerprintz days and was about the Irish Troubles, did not receive much airplay in UK. During the late 1980s, The Silencers opened for David Bowie and U2 as well as touring for 4 months with Simple Minds. Despite modest success in the UK, The Silencers had an almost fanatical following in mainland Europe, especially France and Spain. In more recent years the band were best known for supplying the theme music of a popular advertising campaign for VisitScotland. Burns was once described by fellow band member Jimme O'Neill as \\"a dark, smouldering presence, rocking slowly back and forwards on his heels, caressing jagged, bittersweet melodies from his black Les Paul.\\" After five albums, Burns left The Silencers in 2000, rarely playing on-stage again. After two years in Switzerland Burns moved to Wales. He was diagnosed with lung cancer in late 2006 and had unsuccessful courses of treatment. Reportedly a keen environmentalist whose motto was \\"Planet Before Profit\\", he was keen to try metabolic therapy, a controversial alternative treatment not available on the NHS, which uses natural methods including diet to boost the immune system. Ex- bandmate Jinky Gilmour aka JJ Gilmour organised a benefit concert for Burns at the ABC in Glasgow in January. Despite Burns' claiming he was the \\"forgotten man of Scottish rock\\", the 1,500 capacity venue sold out. The date was planned six weeks after his last course of chemotherapy. On that night Burns had regained enough strength to play with original band members and those from subsequent line-ups. Death Burns died from lung cancer on 26 March 2007, aged 50, in Wales.

Established in 1854 as a market place for regional farmers, the square has developed over the decades into a multipurpose venue that accommodates events ranging from concerts to political rallies, and has long provided a popular gathering place for artists, street musicians, war veterans, and activists. Along with the Market House, Market Square was home to Knoxville's City Hall from 1868 to 1924. Market Square was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Land for the market place was given to the city by William G. Swan and Joseph A. Mabry.The Fragile 15 List of Knox County's Most Endangered Properties , Knox Heritage, Inc., 2006 (accessed March 2, 2009) Farmers from the surrounding area would bring their wagons to the Market House, where they sold their produce and wares.Market Square History , City of Knoxville website, accessed March 2, 2009 During the Civil War, the Union Army used the Market House as a barracks and magazine.Jack Neely, Market Square: A History of the Most Democratic Place on Earth (Knoxville, Tenn.: Market Square District Association, 2009). Knoxville's post-Civil War population boom brought about continued development in Market Square, most notably the construction of Peter Kern's confections store (now The Oliver Hotel) in 1876 and Max Arnstein's seven-story department store in 1906. After the Market House damaged by fire in 1960, the remainder of the building was demolished, and Market Square was converted into a pedestrian mall. A local newspaper once dubbed Market Square, \\"the most democratic place on earth,\\" where \\"the rich and the poor, the white and the black, jostle each other in perfect equality.\\"Neely, Market Square, p. 96. Neely cites a 1900 issue of the Knoxville Journal as the source of the quote. The Square has been mentioned in the works of James Agee, Cormac McCarthy, David Madden, Ken Mink and Richard Yancey, and has hosted performers ranging from Duke Ellington to Steve Winwood. Politicians and activists who have delivered speeches at the Square include Frances Willard, Booker T. Washington, William Jennings Bryan, Edward Ward Carmack, and Ronald Reagan. Location Market Square is located at the center of Knoxville's downtown business district. It consists of an open area covering just over , with storefronts on the east and west sides. The Square is bounded by Union Avenue on the south and Wall Avenue on the north. Two narrow alleys divide the backs of the Square's stores from the backs of buildings lining Gay Street to the east and Walnut Street to the west. Krutch Park lies opposite Union Avenue to the southeast, and the TVA Towers overlook the Square from the north. Market Square is one of only two locations in Knoxville where the street addresses still follow the city's pre-1890 numbering format, the other being Emory Place north of downtown. Under this format, the street addresses are numbered starting at \\"1,\\" as opposed to the newer system in use elsewhere in the city, which uses 3, 4, and 5-digit street addresses. HistoryEarly years= View of Market Square, with the first Market House on the left Knoxville's first market house, built in 1816, was located on Main Street, but was sold by 1823. Over the next thirty years, farmers simply sold produce out of their wagons, usually parked along Prince (now Market Street) or Gay. In 1853, William G. Swan and Joseph A. Mabry, who had been speculating in land around Knoxville, purchased an tract of pastureland from physician John Fouche that lay north of Union Avenue. Hoping to boost the land's value, they donated a small part of this tract-- the present Market Square-- to the city for the construction of a market house. The deed stipulated that the land must be used for this purpose, or ownership would revert to Swan and Mabry, or their heirs. The original Market House was designed by the architectural firm Newman & Maxwell, and opened in January 1854. As many farmers preferred to sell produce from their wagons rather than pay the three dollars per month stall rental fee, the Market House saw scant use in its early years, even after Knoxville banned curb-side selling. A few shops sprang up on the Square, however, among them Albert Hudiburg's grocery, Patrick Tracey's saloon, a lumberyard run by John Jones, and Peter Knott's \\"bowling saloon.\\" By 1861, Market Square had become significant enough to be a designated polling station for the Ordinance of Secession vote that took place on June 8 of that year. In late 1863, when the Union Army occupied Knoxville, the Market House was converted into a barracks and ammunition magazine. Much of the stall furniture was tossed outside and ruined by the elements, and the Square's shopkeepers continuously voiced their fears about the large amounts of volatile gunpowder being stored in the Market House. For decades after the war, Confederate and Union veterans societies met regularly in buildings on Market Square. =Knoxville's boom period= Market Square, as it appeared on an 1886 map In 1868, Knoxville built its first permanent City Hall-- a two- story building with a belltower-- at the north end of Market Square. The following year, the Market House was expanded northward by about , leaving just a short gap between it and City Hall that acted as a weighing station. During the same period, German immigrant and Confederate veteran Peter Kern opened his \\"ice cream saloon\\" at the southwest corner of the Square. Kern completed the building now known as The Oliver Hotel in 1876, with the first floor serving as a retail confectionery, the second story as an elegant ice cream shop, and the third floor providing a meeting place for the Odd Fellows. The second Market House, built in 1897 By 1876, businesses on Market Square included a millinery, a physician, a pharmacist, a dressmaker, a jeweler, and a boarding house. Within a few years, Fenton's Monumental Marble Works was operating out of a shop on the Square, carving sculptures such as those found at Old Gray Cemetery. Saloons, such as Michael Cullinan's, the Jersey Lily, and Houser & Mournan's, maintained a continued presence, although the Women's Christian Temperance Union was active on the Square by the 1880s. The Knoxville Chronicle (later the Knoxville Journal) relocated its office to Market Square in the 1870s, and it was here that publisher Adolph Ochs began his career in the newspaper industry. By the end of the 1880s, the City Hall building had proved too small and a larger and more elaborate three-story building was completed in 1888. Sausage maker Adolph Ziegler and his partners Ignaz Fanz and Anton Metler began selling sausages out of the Ziegler Building in the 1880s, and two companies-- Baum's and H. T. Hackney-- began as storefronts on Market Square during the same decade. In 1897, the city built a larger Market House that included a second-story auditorium and was adjoined to the City Hall building. Market Square reached its height in 1906 when Max Arnstein built his seven-story department store overlooking the Square's southwest corner. =Decline and revitalization= Vendor on Market Square, circa 1941, with the Market House in the background In 1907, a citywide ordinance banning alcohol was passed, and Market Square's saloons were forced to close. With the arrival of streetcar suburbs to the north, west, south, and east of the downtown area, residents began to move away. In 1925, Kern's business was sold to investors who reorganized the company with a focus on bread making, and the Kern Building on Market Square became Coleman's drugstore. That same year, Knoxville moved its City Hall to the empty Deaf and Dumb Asylum a few blocks away. In 1927, Max Arnstein retired, and his department store closed. In spite of these setbacks, new businesses continued moving to the Square. A local grocery store chain, the White Stores, opened a store on the Square in 1927, and regional grocer Cas Walker opened one of his cash stores on the Square in the early 1940s. Movie theaters also began appearing on the Square, most notably the Rialto in the late 1920s and the Crystal in the 1930s. During the same period, Greek immigrant John Demetrius Cavalaris opened the Golden Sun, beginning a multi-generational presence on the Square. In the 1950s, Knoxville mayor George Dempster spearheaded an effort to tear down the Market House as part of the city's efforts to revitalize its downtown area.Bruce Wheeler, Knoxville, Tennessee: A Mountain City in the New South (Knoxville, Tenn.: University of Tennessee Press, 2005), p. 111. In spite of a campaign by preservationists to save the building, which included speeches by poet Carl Sandburg and conservationist Harvey Broome, the city voted to remove the Market House in November 1959 (the building's fate was further sealed when it partially burned a few months later). The old Market House was replaced by the Market Square Mall, an open-air market that consisted of a series of white \\"toadstool\\"-shaped canopies in 1961. The mall received a boost with the completion of the TVA Towers at the north end of the Square in 1976,East Tennessee Historical Society, Lucile Deaderick (editor), Heart of the Valley: A History of Knoxville, Tennessee (Knoxville, Tenn.: East Tennessee Historical Society, 1976), p. 134. and the construction of Krutch Park in 1981. In 1986, at the urging of historical preservationists, the white canopies were removed, and the Market Square Mall was renamed \\"Market Square.\\" Culture Vendors at Market Square's Farmer's Market Musicians have been a staple of Market Square since at least the late 1860s, when Peter Kern employed brass bands for various festivities. In the 1880s, \\"Dr. Lighthall's Mexican Band\\" first appeared on the Square, and Tennessee politician and fiddler Robert Love Taylor began performing with the \\"Market Hall Fiddlers.\\" Promoter Frank Murphy held fiddle contests in Market Hall in the 1920s which drew the likes of Charlie Bowman, Earl Johnson, and the Tennessee Ramblers,Charles Wolfe, The Tennessee Ramblers: Ramblin' On .\\" Old Time Music, Summer 1974, pp. 5-11.

By the 1980s, diverse styles such as bluegrass, jazz, folk, and punk were being played in Market Square's clubs. The Sundown in the City concert series, established by AC Entertainment in 1997, regularly drew crowds of 10,000 or more before its conclusion after the 2011 season. In his Pulitzer Prize- winning 1957 novel, A Death in the Family, James Agee recalled going into a noisy Market Square bar with his father while they walked through downtown Knoxville in 1915. In a later scene, he mentioned his preference for the Market Square store Harbison's, which his mother considered \\"vulgar,\\" preferring instead Miller's on Gay Street.James Agee, A Death in the Family (New York: McDowell, Obolensky, 1957), pp. 15-16, 77. Cormac McCarthy gives vivid descriptions of Market Square in both his 1965 novel, The Orchard Keeper, and his 1979 novel, Suttree, both of which are set in Knoxville and its vicinity. In the first, one of the characters walks to Market Square, where he witnesses a street preacher \\"screaming incoherently and brandishing a tattered Bible,\\" before traversing the market house and eventually buying traps at a hardware store.Cormac McCarthy, The Orchard Keeper (Random House, 1965), p. 82. In Suttree, the title character sells his fish to a Market Square fish vendor, passing along the way \\"derelict trucks,\\" \\"pariahs,\\" \\"blind singers,\\" \\"organists,\\" \\"psalmists,\\" \\"beggars,\\" and \\"wild street preachers.\\"Cormac McCarthy, Suttree (Vintage, 1992), pp. 66-7. In a later scene, the character Gene Harrogate peers into the Golden Sun Cafe while on a stroll through the downtown area.McCarthy, Suttree, p. 101. Other books that mention Market Square include Anne Armstrong's 1915 novel, The Seas of God (which is set in a fictional town based on Knoxville), Joseph Wood Krutch's 1962 autobiography, More Lives Than One, and David Madden's 1974 novel, Bijou (also set in a fictional town based on Knoxville). More recently, the Square figures in Richard Marius's An Affair of Honor (2001), Ken Mink's \\"Knoxville: A City Born in Blood and Flames,\\" featuring Civil War era action involving the city's richest family, the Armstrongs, and the use of their homes as military headquarters and later as a hospital for wounded soldiers, and Richard Yancey's The Highly Effective Detective (2006). Political groups have been active at Market Square since at least 1876, when politician William F. Yardley spoke before a gathering of Radical Republicans. Temperance activists were among the most vocal in the early 1900s, when temperance leaders such as William Jennings Bryan, Edward Ward Carmack, and Frances Willard gave speeches at Market Hall. Women's suffragist Lizzie Crozier French was active on Market Square as early as the 1880s, and today is depicted in the Square's Women's Suffrage Memorial. Socialist politician Harry McKee spoke at the Square in 1904, and Booker T. Washington delivered a speech on civil rights at the Square in 1909. In 1980, Republican presidential candidate Ronald Reagan spoke before an audience of 6,000 at Market Square. Democratic candidate Walter Mondale spoke at the Square in 1984, but managed to draw just a few hundred.

Kern entered a business partnership with the baker and eventually took over the business. The ground floor of the building at 1 Market Square housed his shop, where he sold bread, candy, ice cream, cake and other confections, and an upper floor housed a ballroom where a French dancing master gave lessons.

Its simple design included an audio preamplifier for use with microphones, an 8 bit analogue to digital converter and an audio output amplifier for impedance matching purposes. The software for the unit was written entirely in Z80 machine code and featured a menu driven interface and an ability to play back a recorded sound shifted over a two octave frequency range using the computer's rudimentary keyboard as a piano keyboard. Although Cheetah Marketing publicised the unit as suitable for home or professional use, the lack of polyphony and the capabilities of the software really limited the usefulness of the product to the low end of the amateur market. Accompanying the main software package, the designers Speedwell Software created a real-time sound processing unit that contained a frequency shifter, sound chopper or Dalek voicebox effect, Echo, reverb and a very strange sound effect called a Bubbelizer that was a failed attempt at a phase shifter. The Cheetah Sound Sampler, although crude and cheap, was one of many such electronic devices that introduced home computer owners to the possibilities of digital recording and the principles of electronic music that was, at the time, still reserved for a relative few who had the resources to buy expensive professional and semi-professional equipment.

This superfamily is generally included within the Gastropoda, but may instead be a group of monoplacophorans. The taxon first appeared late in the Cambrian and continued until late in the Triassic. Biology Unlike normal gastropods, the shells of Bellerophonts are characterised by a completely planispiral pattern of coiling, such as one finds in shelled cephalopods. Experts disagree whether Bellerophontids should be classified as torted gastropods, or as untorted Tergomya, or whether the group Bellerophontida is perhaps an artificial construct, consisting of a number of distinct groups of Palaeozoic molluscs which evolved the same type of spiral shell independently.Wagner, P.

(1960) regarded the bellerophontids as torted gastropods even though they have essentially symmetrical, planispiral shells. The narrower apex was probably held to the rear while the wider aperture was oriented to the front where the animal could easily emerge or retreat. Taxonomy Historical background = The taxonomy of the Bellerophontoidea (renamed from the original Bellerophontacea) has gone through a number of revisions since M'Coy established the Bellerophontaceae in 1851 for planospiral archeogastropods. The naming followed the convention for superfamilies that prevailed until at least 1992 with Wahlman The Bellerophontacea were placed in the order Bellerophontida established by Ulrich and Scofield in 1897Ulrich E.

(2005) leaves the higher taxonomic position of the Bellerophontoidea as uncertain (Gastropoda or Monoplacophora) and divides the group into 8 families as listed: * Bellerophontoidea ** ‚Ä† Bellerophontidae ** ‚Ä† Bucanellidae ** ‚Ä† Bucaniidae ** ‚Ä† Euphemitidae ** ‚Ä† Pterothecidae ** ‚Ä† Sinuitidae ** ‚Ä† Tremanotidae ** ‚Ä† Tropidodiscidae The Bellerophontidae, Bucanitidae, Pterothacidae, and Tropododiscidae compare with the subfamilies Bellerophontinae, Bucanitinae, Pterothacinae, and Tropododiscinae included in the Bellerophontidae and the Bucanellidae, Euphemitidae, and Sinuitidae compare with the subfamilies Bucanellinae, Euphemitinae, and Sinuitinae included in the Sinuitidae, as found in the Treatise. The Tremanitiae is based on the genus Tremanotus which was included in the Bucanitinae in the Treatise. Bouchet & Rocroi (2005) points out (page 271) that assignment of \\"symmetrical univalved mollusks \\"bellerophonts\\" either to Gastropoda or to Monoplacophora or Tergomya is controversial.\\" =Note on nomenclature= Until recently with the ruling of the ICZN, -the ending -ACEA, or -ACEAE, was more or less standard for superfamilies in invertebrate paleontology and zoology.

Retrieved on December 20, 2008. The episode was written by supervising producer Paul Zbyszewski and producer Brian K. Vaughan and directed by executive producer Jack Bender. In 1977, when Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) return to the past unannounced, James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) further perpetuates his lie to continue to hide their true identities. All that suddenly changes when Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) is found as well, but is forcefully captured by Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) in order to hide the lie. In 2007, Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), Benjamin Linus (Michael Emerson), Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) and the passengers of the Ajira Airways Flight 316 arrive on the island in the present. Plot The episode begins with the crash of Ajira Airways Flight 316, a transpacific flight piloted by Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey), on the small island off the coast of the main island, where the Dharma Initiative Hydra Station is located. Lapidus crash lands the plane on a runway that was built by the native population of the island, known as the Others, and the survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 (as seen in \\"The Glass Ballerina\\"). While the passengers begin to debate what to do next, crash survivor and former leader of the Others Ben Linus (Michael Emerson) begins to travel to the main island. He is followed by survivor Sun-Hwa Kwon (Yunjin Kim), who believes her husband Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim) is on the main island, and later Frank. After reaching a group of canoes, Sun knocks Ben out with an oar (Ben reappearing still unconscious in the Hydra station, as seen in \\"The Life and Death of Jeremy Bentham\\") and travels with Frank to the abandoned barracks of the Dharma Initiative. Waiting there is Christian Shephard (John Terry), who shows Sun and Frank a picture of new recruits to the Dharma Initiative from 1977, including Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox), Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) and Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia). He also tells her that Jin is with them in 1977. In 1977, following the events of the previous episode \\"LaFleur\\", James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway) explains to Jack, Kate and Hurley the situation regarding Dharma and the shift in time. Sawyer arranges for the three of them to join the Dharma Initiative as new recruits (Jack is assigned janitorial work and Hurley is a chef and Kate works in the motor pool) with help from Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell), who forges the necessary documentation. Juliet also learns that Amy (Reiko Aylesworth) has named her baby Ethan, who will eventually join the Others. Meanwhile, Jin travels to the Dharma Initiative Flame Station because he believes that its occupant, Radzinsky (Eric Lange), will know if Flight 316 crashed on the island. There is no evidence of a plane crashing on the island as the plane is in 2007. Soon, an alarm is set off and Jin finds Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) wandering in the jungle. After a brief moment of reunion, Jin is forced to act as if Sayid were a Hostile to placate Radzinsky, who would not understand where Sayid really came from. Sawyer is summoned to the Flame and moves Sayid to a jail cell at the Barracks while he decides what to do. Later in the evening, Jack visits Sawyer and Juliet's house to discuss the situation. James tells Jack that he is in charge and has a different approach to leadership than Jack had with the survivors of Oceanic 815: Sawyer prefers to carefully plan out his actions, as opposed to Jack's more impulsive style of command. Meanwhile, at the jail, an adolescent brings Sayid a sandwich and introduces himself as Ben (Sterling Beaumon). Production The episode was co-written by Brian K. Vaughan. The episode was written by supervising producer Paul Zbyszewski and producer Brian K. Vaughan and directed by executive producer Jack Bender.

It was formed in 1955. The club plays in the Ardal Leagues South West, which is tier 3 of the Welsh football pyramid. Caerau Ely were formed in 1955 joining the junior division of the Cardiff Combination League. A set of red jerseys given to the club by Mr.Ron Miller of Cross Bros. AFC was to determine the colours of the club forever. The club started its playing days on the Ely Racecourse moving on to Glyn Derw School in the eighties and then finally moving onto the Cwrt-yr-Ala ground in Ely. In 1991 they gained entry to the new Senior League and then progressed to the CC Sports Welsh League in 1998 after beating Dinas Powys 1-0 in the play-off held at Bridgend. The history shows that after winning well over EIGHTY combined league titles and cups in its time, Caerau Ely has become one of the most successful clubs in Cardiff. Season 04/05 the club gained promotion from the 3rd Division to the 2nd finishing in the third place, they carried on surviving near the bottom and scraping to safety at the end of most seasons, with most players leaving their best days behind them, the club realised they had to look at the future. Season 06/07 saw the coming together of Caerau Ely and the youth of Llanishen Dons football club. Caerau without a representative side in the youth league approached Llanishen to invite them to join the Caerau set up. The advantages for Llanishen were obvious in that they could play at a very good level and the advantages for Caerau were that they would have a new group of young players for the future. The first season saw the youngsters finish third in the East division and also saw a number of players move up and take their place in the senior side, the next season they finished second with even more of a presence in the first side. Season 09/10 was the biggest in the club's history ending in promotion to Division One, winning 8 drawing 2 and with 1 loss in the last 11 games they took third place. On times the club played with a starting eleven that did not have a player over the age of 21, so the youth policy adopted in 06/07 had finally paid off. The first Season in Division One went very well, with the club finishing with a respectful fifth place, which was the club's highest finish in their history and a great achievement. Unfortunately the second season the club came up very short, with major problems trying to keep hold of players and discipline on and off the pitch returning to days the club thought they had moved on from. They finished bottom of the league. Caerau Ely started the 2012‚Äì13 season back in Division Two after a short but eye opening period in the first division. The club employed a new team Manager in Nana Baah, who was helped by Giles Smith and Dominic Broad to try and rebuild the team. In their first season in charge, they managed to work wonders and gain promotion back into Division One and in the process creating a new professional approach at the club. Discipline at the club was of a very good standard and major improvements have been made under the management of Nana Baah. In 2014‚Äì15 Caerau won the Welsh League Division One title and were runners up in the league cup losing to Taff's Well A.F.C. at Jenner Park.

The whole print was 2.95 metres wide and 3.57 metres high (approximately 9'8\\" by 11'8¬Ω\\"), on 192 large woodblocks.British Museum - Albrecht D√ºrer and others, The Triumphal Arch, woodcut. Images and description from the British Museum. Hieronymus Andreae, or Andre√§, or Hieronymus Formschneider,\\"Formschneider\\" is German for block-cutter, and Andreae often signed himself as \\"Hieronymus Formschneider\\" or \\"Hieronymus Andreae Formschneider\\". He used these styles on the title pages of his books. \\"Jerome of Nuremberg\\" may be found pre-1940. In even older sources he may be called Resch or R√∂sch. His surname is also spelled Andre, Andreae, Enderlin, Enndres; or Grapheus. (died 7 May 1556) was a German woodblock cutter (\\"formschneider\\"), printer, publisher and typographer closely associated with Albrecht D√ºrer. Andreae's best known achievements include the enormous, 192-block Triumphal Arch woodcut, designed by D√ºrer for Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor,Landau and Parshall, 207-209 and his design of the characteristic German \\"blackletter\\" Fraktur typeface (\\"Gothic\\" to most English-speakers), on which German typefaces were based for several centuries.David C. Greetham, Textual Scholarship: An Introduction, p.234, (reprint) Routledge, 1994, , He was also significant as a printer of music. In the opinion of Adam von Bartsch, although Andreae never designed woodcuts (as opposed to designing typefaces), the quality of his work was such that he, along with Hans L√ºtzelburger and Jost de Negker, should be considered an artist.Triumph of the Emperor Maximilian I, Adam von Bartsch, reprint by BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2008 (online), , Life and work There is some evidence that he matriculated at the University of Leipzig in 1504, although this might also mean that he worked for the university rather than being a student.Landau and Parshall, 216 He became a citizen of Nuremberg in 1523, although he had probably run a workshop there for nearly a decade by then. He also cut metal dies and stamps, including those for type and coins, and the design, and perhaps production, of print type may also have constituted a large part of his business, which was commented on as being very diverse. According to the 18th-century historian Christoph Gottlieb von Murr, Emperor Maximilian regularly dropped into Andreae's workshop on his visits to Nuremberg:Landau and Parshall, 217. This is less implausible than it might seem, as Maximilian was one of many Habsburg rulers who took a close, and in his case rather interfering, interest in watching artists. > ....this Hieronymous resided in Breite Gasse, in this city, and his quarters > extended in the rear to Fraueng√§sslein [i.e. \\"Women's Alley\\"]. It was he who > cut most of Albrecht D√ºrer's designs into blocks, among them D√ºrer's > \\"Triumphal Chariot\\" [or \\"Car\\"] of His Imperial Majesty. At that time, His > Majesty drove almost daily to Fraueng√§sslein to watch his artistry, so much > so that it became proverbial that \\"the emperor has driven once more to the > \\"women's alley\\".\\"Quoted Stanford University. Parshall, n.109, p. 395 has the > German: \\"Der Kaiser fahret abermals ins Frauenga√ülein\\", which is more simply > translated \\"The Emperor has gone to the women's alley again\\". The exact > usage of the phrase is not clarified by von Murr. He worked as blockcutter on the Triumphal Arch from 1515‚Äì17, and he and his workshop cutters would then probably have been fully occupied on that one huge commission, the quality of which has always been recognised. He also cut the Great Triumphal Car and other works by D√ºrer for Maximilian, but he probably appeared on the Nuremberg scene too late to produce most of D√ºrer's other major woodcuts, which mostly predate 1513. His Fraktur script was first developed for the large texts underneath the image of the Car, and appears in its final perfected form in his (2nd) 1538 edition of D√ºrer's book on geometry. It was popular and became widely adopted, becoming the most widely used typeface by Lutheran printers in northern Germany by the end of the sixteenth century.Stanley Boorman, et al. \\"Printing and publishing of music.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. 9 Mar. 2009 In the case of the Arch and the Car, the blocks, with Andreae's mark on them, survive in the Albertina, Vienna. Indeed, negotiations are documented from 1526 between Maximilian's heirs and Andreae, who refused to release the blocks for the Arch before being paid outstanding debts; he had meanwhile published an unauthorized partial edition himself in 1520, for which the city council had to apologise to the new Emperor, Charles V.Landau and Parshall, 217-218 The cutters of most \\"single-leaf\\" woodcuts (prints) produced at the period are unknown, as they were only rarely (usually if they also acted as publisher) credited on the printed piece. If the original block has survived these may be marked or signed, and are normally so in the case of Maximilian's projects, to ensure the right cutter was paid from the large teams. In the absence of other evidence, it is not usually worthwhile to speculate on the identity of a cutter based on style or quality, so much of Andreae's work remains untraceable in the large production of Nuremberg in this period. It is for example likely that Andreae cut the famous D√ºrer's Rhinoceros of 1515, with a lengthy inscription, but there is no direct evidence of this. With books there is more evidence, from title-pages. He was the cutter for the many illustrations and the printer of the books that D√ºrer was working on in his final years before his death in 1526: on geometry - the Art of measurement (1525) - and Fortification (1527), and Human Proportions (1528, for D√ºrer's widow). D√ºrer returned from his trip to the Netherlands in 1521 with a number of gifts for friends, including an \\"exceedingly large horn\\" for Andreae. A D√ºrer drawing in the British Museum (W 899) inscribed by the artist \\"Fronica 1525 Formschneiderin\\" may be of Andreae's wife (Veronica), as an old inscription on the back says.Both points from Searchable Heath biography He was buried in St John's Church in Nuremberg. Music publishing After D√ºrer's death he became important as a printer and publisher of music, and a designer of musical type ‚Äì in this field he tends to be known as \\"Hieronymus Formschneider\\", the name used on his title-pages. He published music in a partnership lasting between 1533-1550 with the bookseller Hans Ott, their respective roles probably falling into the typical modern ones of printer and publisher. Their most ambitious production was the Novum et insigne opus musicum, a two volume anthology of one hundred motets published in 1537-1538, of which 177 examples survive, more than any other such work published before 1550.Gustavson, Royston Robert, Hans Ott, Hieronymus Formschneider, and the Novum et insigne opus musicum (Nuremberg, 1537-1538) Dissertation abstract. Formschneider created a single-impression typeface for music, which he first used in 1534; in this he was only the second in Germany, being preceded by two years by Christian Egenolff of Frankfurt, who printed Petrus Tritonius's edition of Odarum Horatii concentus in 1532. There is no evidence that Formschneider was himself a musician, or that he had any deep understanding of what he was printing.Royston Gustavson. \\"Formschneider, Hieronymus.\\" Grove Music Online. Oxford Music Online. 9 Mar. 2009 . Also bearing Formschneider's imprint is the enormous Choralis Constantinus, which appeared in three volumes in 1550-55. This was the largest sixteenth century collection of Mass Proper settings, mainly by composer Heinrich Isaac, with the portion left unfinished completed on his death by his student Ludwig Senfl.The complete motets, Introduction, By Orlando di Lasso, Published by A-R Editions, Inc., 1995, , Trouble with the law He was an early sympathiser with the ideas of Martin Luther, printing his prayerbook in 1527 (but omitting Luther's name, perhaps out of discretion for buyers in Catholic territories), and was then jailed briefly for sympathy with, and perhaps some involvement in, the German Peasants' War in 1525.Landau and Parshall, 217 Described by Peter Parshall as \\"an opportunist of ... ambition and occasional unscrupulousness\\", he was often in trouble with the authorities.Landau and Parshall, 218 After D√ºrer's death he was accused, with Sebald Beham, of producing a plagiarized edition of the book on the proportions of the horse that D√ºrer never completed (a work very popular with generations of artists).Mayor In 1542 he fled the city to avoid two weeks in jail for failing to appear in court on a charge of slandering a member of the Council of the city, though he later returned.Landau and Parshall, 218 References *Bartrum, Giulia.

Only one was built. Design The Gloster (previously Gloucestershire) Aircraft Co. began aircraft design and manufacture in 1917. Up to 1930, all but one of their machines had been single-engined, the exception being the A.S.31, which was not originally a Gloster design but based on the de Havilland DH.67B. Thus the appearance in 1930 of the four-engined troop carrier (TC) TC.33 was a complete break from their tradition and indeed was the only four-engined aircraft that Gloster ever built. It was designed to meet Air Ministry specification C.16/28, which required the ability to carry 30 troops and their equipment for 1,200 miles (1,930 km) and was the same specification that produced the Handley Page H.P.43 and the Vickers Type 163. The TC.33 was a large single bay biplane with no stagger and 7¬∞ sweepback. Both wings had metal lattice spars and metal ribs with fabric covering. The lower wing was unusual in that its centre section had marked anhedral so that the main spars met at the top of the fuselage, leaving the interior unobstructed. A similar arrangement, though with less anhedral was used by the slightly earlier Handley Page H.P.42 airliner. The outer end of this centre section was strut braced to the lower fuselage. The TC.33 was also unusual in having a lower wing of (slightly) greater span than the upper; most unequal span wings had a larger upper wing. The four evaporatively cooled Rolls-Royce Kestrel engines were mounted in two nacelles, each containing a tractor-pusher pair together with their steam condenser and mounted between the wings at the end of the centre section. They were each carried by two vertical struts above the nacelle, complicated strutting below and by further strutting to the lower wing roots.Flight p.531 The wide (22 ft 6 in (6.8 m)) split axle undercarriage had vertical legs from the front wing spar at the same point and bracing from the axles to the fuselage.Flight p.531-2 The fuselage was quite elegant, slender, oval in cross section and smoothly metal skinned. The cockpit was enclosed, but there were open gunners' positions at nose and tail. Like the cockpit, the long main cabin was heated and soundproofed. There was a large hatch in the floor for heavy loads with an integral hoist mounted above it, plus a smaller roof hatch through which loads could be lowered by crane. The biplane tail unit had conventional fabric covered endplate fins and rudders, but the tailplanes had an unusual configuration with the upper tailplane and elevator strut mounted above the fuselage and the much narrower chord lower part fixed to the lower fuselage.Flight p.532 Development The TC.33 first flew on 23 February 1932. Development flying showed it had good performance but suffered from elevator and rudder flutter. The former was cured with mass balancing but the rudder flutter persisted, particularly in high speed dives until the rudders were redesigned. It was exhibited at the 1932 RAF Hendon Display and then went on to RAF Martlesham Heath for trials. Once in the air, the TC.33 was judged a pleasant machine to fly, but it was crucially let down by its full load take off performance. Even at Martlesham it was hard to get it off the ground in a reasonable distance. The undercarriage behaviour was also criticised. Because of these concerns over take off performance at English temperatures and altitudes, the Air Ministry did not place an order, judging it would not cope with the hot and high conditions found at many RAF fields across the Empire. Thus J9832 was the only one of its kind. Indeed, none of the C.16/28 contenders were awarded a production contract.

Its last assignment was with the 37th Fighter-Bomber Wing, based at Clovis Army Airfield, New Mexico. It was inactivated on 25 June 1953. History 30th Fighter Squadron P-40 Warhawks, Aguadulce Army Airfield, Panama 1943. Note the single Cessna UC-78 twin engine trainer on the flightline. 30th Fighter Squadron P-39Q ‚Äì #47 at Panama Air Depot, Albrook Field, Panama Canal Zone, March 1945 Established in 1939 as the 30th Pursuit Squadron and activated on 1 February 1940 at Albrook Field, Panama Canal Zone. This unit was part of the build-up of the Canal Zone's defenses as war approached. Initially equipped with Boeing P-26A Peashooters, the mission of the squadron was air defense of the Panama Canal. The Squadron was briefly moved to Rio Hato Field on 5 October 1940 and, following a month there, returned to Albrook on 13 November, where it remained until 24 November 1941. However, as Albrook became more and more crowded with new units, the Squadron was transferred to La Chorrera Army Airfield, Panama on 24 November 1941 where it was equipped with modern Curtiss P-40 Warhawks. The unit shared the base with the 31st Pursuit Squadron at the time. Like all other fighter units in the USAAF, the squadron was redesignated as the 30th Fighter Squadron on 15 May 1942 and, briefly, returned to Albrook, but reverted to Chorrera Field #1 on 1 June 1942. The Squadron remained them until 5 January 1943, when it transferred to Anton Army Airfield, Panama. However, all squadron personnel were reassigned to the 53d Fighter Squadron at France Field. The squadron was re-manned at Anton Field with new personnel, then moved to Aguadulce Field, Panama in February 1943. It was reclassified as an Operational Training Unit (OTU), and its mission was changed to preparing new fighter pilots for duty in the tropical conditions of the Panama Canal Zone. In effect, the 30th Fighter Squadron had switched places with the 53d Fighter Squadron, and inherited 28 aircraft, being mixed models of the Curtiss P-40s, most of which had seen hard service in Puerto Rico and the Antilles Air Command previously. The Squadron also had small detachments at Albrook Field and Corozal in the Canal Zone and, by October, another detachment was maintained at Howard Field as well. With the dissolution of its parent 37th Fighter Group, the Squadron was assigned directly to the XXVI Fighter Command from 1 November 1943. Although still classified as an OTU, the squadron did mount some air defense patrols. The Squadron also had the unique distinction, in keeping with its OTU role, to be selected to train the cadre of the 1st Brazilian Fighter Squadron of the Brazilian Air Force, which went on to great achievements in Italy after equipping in the United States. with Republic P-47D Thunderbolts. Thus, at one point, when the concentration of Brazilians in the Squadron was quite high, it can be fairly said that the unit had the honor of being one of the only United States units to participate in the defense of the Panama Canal while being manned almost entirely by foreign pilots. In January 1945, the Squadron surrendered its tired old P-40s to the Panama Air Depot and was reequipped with new Bell P-39Q Airacobras. In addition, the \\"official\\" unit insignia (a black knight in armor, lance in hand, seated on a plunging horse in a white circle background) had finally been approved (officially, on 26 June 1945, although it is known to have been painted on some aircraft much earlier, see infobox). By June 1945, the Squadron had been completely reequipped with Lockheed P-38L Lightnings. However, no sooner had conversion to the P-38's been completed than the unit was moved to Howard Field, where the entire complement of P-38s was hangared and the unit activities ran down with the end of the war in Europe. The squadron ceased all flying activities in June, and the P-38s were stored in a hangar at Howard. By October 1945, the squadron was reduced to a non-operational administrative organization. Inactivated on 15 October 1946. During the Cold War, the squadron was reactivated by Tactical Air Command as the 30th Fighter-Bomber Squadron at Clovis AFB, New Mexico on 8 April 1953 and was programmed to receive F-86F Sabres. However, it was neither manned or equipped due to personnel and equipment shortages and was inactivated on 25 June. =Lineage= * Constituted 30th Pursuit Squadron (Interceptor) on 22 December 1939 : Activated on 1 February 1940 : Redesignated 30 Fighter Squadron on 15 May 1942 : Inactivated on 15 October 1946 * Redesignated 30th Fighter-Bomber Squadron on 3 March 1953 : Activated on 8 April 1953 : Inactivated on 25 June 1953. =Assignments= * 37th Pursuit (later Fighter) Group, 1 February 1940 * XXVI Fighter Command, 1 November 1943 * 6th Fighter Wing, 25 August-15 October 1946 * 37th Fighter- Bomber Group, 8 April-25 June 1953. =Stations= * Albrook Field, Canal Zone, 1 February 1940 * Rio Hato AAB, Panama, 5 October 1940 * Albrook Field, Canal Zone, 13 November 1940 * La Chorrera AAF, Panama, 24 November 1941 * Anton AAF, Panama, 3 January 1943 * Aguadulce AAF, Panama, 10 February 1943 * Howard Field, Canal Zone, 25 January 1945 ‚Äì 15 October 1946 * Clovis AFB, New Mexico, 8 April-25 June 1953. =Aircraft= * P-26 Peashooter, 1940‚Äì1941 * P-40 Warhawk, 1940‚Äì1945 * P-39 Airacobra, 1944‚Äì1945 * P-38 Lightning, 1945‚Äì1946 * P-47 Thunderbolt, 1946.

The dinner was cancelled in 1989, when alumni awardee Frank Lorenzo, then Chairman of Eastern Air Lines, was widely criticized for his treatment of Eastern Air Lines' striking machinists and for his controversial managing techniques. In 2004, the award was given to American real estate businessman Peter Kalikow, who was serving as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and was the former owner and publisher of the New York Post. Kalikow's son graduated from the college in 2002 and he had been a major donor to the university. His selection marked the first time since 1979 that the award was given to a non-alumnus of the college.His receipt had generated controversy among professors and alumni, among them Professor Michael Rosenthal and former Alumni Association President Harvey Rubin, an independent publisher who is the father of college alumni James and Elizabeth Rubin.

The film premiered at the 2007 Toronto International Film Festival. It is directed by John Crowley and stars Andrew Garfield (who won the 2008 Best Actor BAFTA TV Award for his performance), Peter Mullan, and Katie Lyons. The North American cinematic release was distributed by The Weinstein Company. Plot Andrew Garfield portrays Eric Wilson. The film commences when Eric is released from either a secure unit or prison under the name Jack Burridge. His past is told through flashbacks. Eric Wilson befriends Philip Craig, who is a troublemaker and rescues him from a group of bullies. It is later disclosed that Philip is the victim of rape perpetrated by his older brother. Philip gets into an argument with a girl from their school who comes across the two boys loitering in a park. She criticizes them and refers to them as \\"scum\\" when she witnesses Philip vandalising a park sign with a Stanley knife. Philip approaches her and starts slashing at her forearms with the knife. He grabs the girl and drags her under a bridge. When Philip drops the knife, Eric picks it up, and follows them under the bridge. The girl is killed, although the film shows neither who kills her nor how. Eric (dubbed as Boy A during the trial) and Philip are remanded into custody at secure units. Philip ends up dead, assumed to be suicide, but Eric believes that he may have been killed by youth offenders. Eric is later released and is guided by rehabilitation worker Terry (Peter Mullan). Eric, shy and eager to be a good citizen again, builds up a new life under the name Jack Burridge. He finds a job, befriends his colleague Chris (Shaun Evans), falls in love with the office girl, Michelle (Katie Lyons), and rescues a little girl who would otherwise have died after a car crash. An article in a local newspaper portrays him as a hero and includes a picture of both boys in the story. Eric wants to be honest with Michelle and reveal his past, but Terry urges him not to do so because it is too dangerous. Terry is afraid that people may attack Eric because there is a reward of ¬£20,000 for finding him. Terry argues that it is not dishonest because \\"Eric is history and Jack is a new person\\". The rehabilitation worker is less satisfied with his own son. The son discovers Eric's true identity from newspaper articles about him being released, his new role as the hero and information he looks up without permission on his father's computer. Out of jealousy, he reveals this to the public and as a result, Eric loses his job and his best friend Chris distances himself from him. Michelle goes missing, and people suspect that Eric is somehow involved, though it is later revealed she has sequestered herself at home, devastated about the revelation that Jack is actually Eric. Eric repeatedly tries to phone Terry but gets his voicemail. He flees from his home to avoid reporters and travels to Blackpool. There he meets (or imagines meeting) Michelle, who tells him she was not the one who revealed his past and would have eventually understood if he told her the truth, and then leaves. After saying farewell messages in voicemails to Terry and Chris, the film concludes with Eric standing over the edge of a pier.

Biography Bruce was born in Musselburgh, near Edinburgh in Scotland. He was born John Charles Young, but adopted the stage name of Robert the Bruce, later shortened to Robert Bruce, and kept the name when he quit wrestling. In the ring he played the quintessential villain who prefaced every low blow with an evil smirk, once saying \\"Honestly, it's better being a bad guy. I suppose it's the underlying evil you may have. You get a lot more fun.\\"Obituary in Dominion Post 5 March 2009 page B3 He began wrestling in London in 1967, and toured the United Kingdom, South Africa, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, eventually settling in New Zealand in the 1970s after wrestling John da Silva there for the Commonwealth championship in 1972. He held the Commonwealth Heavyweight Title on and off over a five-year period, and wrestled for the World Title. In 1972, he had a small role as one of the bouncers in the Korova Milk Bar in the film A Clockwork Orange. Bruce retired from wrestling due to injuries to his back and elbows, and decided to form a talent agency in 1978 when he realised that there was no such company in New Zealand. The Robert Bruce Agency was nicknamed the \\"Ugly Bruce\\" agency, as Bruce claimed his first clients were his former wrestling friends seeking roles as ugly people, thugs or stuntmen. His later clients included well-known New Zealand actors such as Cliff Curtis, the late Kevin Smith, Robbie Magasiva, Frankie Stevens, Jackie Clarke and Temuera Morrison. He operated out of a villa in suburban Grey Lynn, and his word was his bond. The villa was distinguished by the word \\"Tobermory\\", in memory of the lighthouse on the Isle of Mull where his maternal grandfather was a lighthouse keeper, and where his ashes are to be spread. In addition to representing several of New Zealand's top actors, Bruce worked as a stuntman and fight co-ordinator on several New Zealand films, television shows and theatrical plays, working on 73 TV series, 39 films and 21 live shows, and as an actor played the role of a former international rugby player in the 1991 film Old Scores.Martin, H., & Edwards, S.

Bruce died suddenly and unexpectedly after a short illness on 2 March 2009; his age at the time of his death was reported as unknown by some sources, although other sources say he was 65. He is survived by his partner Gabriella Larkin, his elder sister Merle Frame, her husband Robert and their two children. Robert had three daughters, the product of his first marriage to Jean Young, formally Gould. They married in London on 2 February 1963. He was then a Police Constable based in Union Road Station near Wandsworth. Their first daughter Laurie was born in July 1963 with the addition of twin daughters Donna and Julie three years later. They lived as a family in Police accommodation in Charlton South London until they separated and he left to start a new life in New Zealand with his new partner Lyn. He travelled the world with his wrestling and acting career and letters, birthday cards, photographs, etc. were exchanged between the children and Robert for a good few years.

The Edmonton Riverboat is 52 metres long and configured to carry 399 passengers as of 2020. The Edmonton Riverboat primary operates during the summer months as the cold weather, variable river levels and the North Saskatchewan River is often iced- over throughout the winter. History On 2 April 1992, Edmonton Mayor Jan Reimer would announce a CA$3.4-million venture partially funded by the federal and provincial government to build a dock for the proposed Edmonton Riverboat. Edmonton builder Scott Steel would construct the riverboat within the city, but would refuse to release the vessel, claiming he was owed $1.35-million. The Riverboat was a lifelong dream of Edmonton businessmen Ray Collins who formed the North Saskatchewan Riverboat Company and prepared the boat. The North Saskatchewan Riverboat Company would fail before launching the Edmonton Queen, and the riverboat was subsequently sold to the development corporation Carrington Properties for CA$500,000 in early 1995. The Edmonton Queen would eventually be launched on the North Saskatchewan River on 4 May 1995. In April 2016, the boat was sold in auction for $553,000 and underwent renovations, upgrades, and a change in name to Edmonton Riverboat. The Edmonton Riverboat has had a number of grounding and weather incidents incidents throughout its history. In July 2019, the boat became lodged on a sandbar. The 300 passengers on board were rescued by the Edmonton Fire Department.

Additionally, the 133 AW is prepared to support the State of Minnesota with troops capable of assisting in a disaster or other emergencies as directed by the Governor of Minnesota. There are five major units in the 133 AW: Headquarters Group; Maintenance Group; Operations Group; Medical Group; and Mission Support Group. The Minnesota National Guard Joint Force Headquarters (JFHQ-MN) is a joint Army National Guard and Air National Guard command headquartered at MSPJARS. JFHQ- MN provides personnel, intelligence, operations, logistics, and resource guidance and support to the Major Commands in the Minnesota National Guard: 34th (Red Bull) Infantry Division; 1/34th Brigade Combat Team; 34th Combat Aviation Brigade; 84th Troop Command; 347th Regional Support Group; 175th Regional Training Institute; 133rd Airlift Wing; and the 148th Fighter Wing at Duluth Air National Guard Base. JFHQ-MN coordinates military support at the request of the Governor in the event of a disaster and is capable of providing a joint command staff for federal military forces operating within the State of Minnesota. History In 1920 a hangar was built on a former auto racing track to accommodate airmail service, and the 160-acre property became known as Speedway Field. In 1923, the airport was renamed Wold-Chamberlain Field in honor of two local pilots, Ernest Wold and Cyrus Chamberlain, who lost their lives in combat during World War I. The airport soon became home to Northwest Airways, which in 1926 won the government's airmail contract and acquired the airport's only hangar. =World War II= In February 1942, after the United States' entry into World War II, the United States Army Air Corps 1454th Base Unit was assigned to Wold-Chamberlain Field to conduct a survey about the usefulness of the airport to the war effort. The unit's mission was to organize, coordinate and supervise the movement of cargo and passengers travelling though the airport by contract airlines and to and from Ferrying Command. Northwest Airlines remained in control of the control tower and flight facilities. Other construction was initiated to expand flight facilities, base operations, passenger service facilities, customs and port of entry facilities. The Army Corps of Engineers was authorized to expand the ramp facilities and also to expand the airfield. Personnel from the Alaskan Wing, Air Transport Command arrived at the airport on 29 December 1942 to organize a control detachment. USAFHRA Document 00185637 On 20 September 1943, the detachment was re designated as Station No. 11, Alaskan Wing, Air Transport Command.USAFHRA Document 00175615 The airport became a key stop on what was designated the \\"Alaskan Route\\", in which aircraft were ferried north to Edmonton Airport in Northern Alberta on the Alaska Route, to support the Alaskan Campaign against the Japanese, and also for eventual transport to Siberia as part of Lend-Lease aid to the Soviet Union. Minneapolis was also a stop on ATC's \\"Crimson Route\\", the ferrying route between the manufacturing facilities in Southern California and the combat bases being constructed in the United Kingdom. It operated as a refueling and maintenance base on the transport route north to Crystal II in the Canadian Northern Territories or Goose Air Station in Labrador to support the combat forces in the United Kingdom, North Africa and other destinations. With the end of the war in September 1945, the military mission of the airport was changed on 1 January 1946 to be a supply depot for Air Transport Command cargo aircraft throughout the upper Great Lakes region and to serve as a terminus for transcontinental planes and their upkeep.USAFHRA Document 00184935 =Continental Air Command= On 1 July 1948 with the inactivation of Air Transport Command, control of the military facilities was transferred to Continental Air Command (ConAC), with the 2465th Air Force Reserve Training Center being activated 28 August. Its mission was to conduct reserve training.USAFHRA Document 00003980 The 440th Troop Carrier Group (Medium) was activated at the field on 3 September equipped with C-47 Skytrains. The 440th trained for troop carrier operations in the Reserve, and became part of the 440th Troop Carrier Wing when it activated in June 1949. It was called to active duty on 1 May 1951 and inactivated four days later with its personnel and equipment being reassigned to other units as a result of the Korean War. After its federal service ended in January 1953, it was reactivated and after a short period as a Fighter- Bomber Group, it transitioned to C-119 Flying Boxcars in 1954. The 440th remained in Minneapolis until November 1957 when it was transferred to the new Air Reserve Station in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. =Air Defense Command= With the inactivation of the 440th Troop Carrier Group in May 1951, the active-duty Air Defense Command (ADC) brought the federalized Kentucky Air National Guard's 123d Fighter-Interceptor Wing to the airport later in May. The 123d FIG's 165th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron was equipped with F-51 Mustangs and trained until the end of its federal service in February 1952. The F-51s were taken over by the active-duty 18th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron, under ADC's 514th Air Defense Group in February 1952. These World War II fighters, used as interceptors, were replaced by F-86F Sabre jet interceptors in 1953. The 514th was redesignated as the 475th Fighter-Interceptor Group (Air Defense) on 18 August 1955 as part of an ADC program to reactivate notable World War II combat units. The 18th FIS was also redesignated as the 432d Fighter- Interceptor Squadron. The F-94 Starfire-equipped 337th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron became the second interceptor squadron at Minneapolis later in 1955. In late 1957, Air Defense Command began to wind down operations at Minneapolis, ostensibly due to the expansion of the civilian airport and jet noise of the interceptors over the urban area surrounding the facility. The 475th FIG was inactivated on 2 January 1958. =Air Force Reserve= The USAF Reserve returned to Minneapolis on 11 February 1963 when the 934th Tactical Airlift Group was activated. Initially flying the C-119 Flying Boxcar, the unit has also periodically deployed to Panama, and later Puerto Rico, to fly cargo and personnel throughout Central and South America since 1979. Upgraded to the C-130 in 1970, the 934th deployed personnel and aircraft to participate in allied operations in the Persian Gulf area and the Balkans in 1990 and later. It has also participated in numerous joint airborne training exercises and humanitarian airlifts. =Minnesota Air National Guard= The Minnesota 109th Fighter Squadron was allocated to the Air National Guard on 24 May 1946 at Minneapolis. During the Korean War it was activated, contributing pilots to Korea's \\"Mig Alley.\\" In the 1950s and early 1960s, the 109th Fighter Interceptor Squadron was providing active air defense commitments with 24-hour alert status. Threats by the Soviet Union to oust Western troops from West Berlin in 1961 prompted the \\"Berlin Crisis\\" and a call-up of selected National Guard forces throughout the nation. Included in this mobilization were members of the 133rd Air Transport Wing, Minnesota Air National Guard, who served in federal active service for 11 months while operating out of their home station at the Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport. During the Vietnam War, although never officially mobilized, the Air Guard flew hundreds of supply and transport missions to Southeast Asia.

Tecoaque is a Mesoamerican archaeological site, located in western Tlaxcala state, central Mexico, close to Calpulalpan. The site was inhabited by the Acolhua, one of the three ethnic groups making up the Aztec Empire (their capital being Tetzcohco, one of the three seats of Aztec power). Tecoaque had many white-stucco temples and was the home to approximately 5,000 people, mostly priests and farmers.  Etymology  The name is a colonial transcription of the Nahuatl \\"Tƒìcuahqueh,\\" meaning both \\"they ate people\\" and \\"people eaters.‚Äù It consists of \\"tƒì-,\\" the indefinite object prefix for people; \\"cuah,\\" the past / participle form of the verb \\"cua\\" (to eat), meaning \\"ate\\" / \\"eating\\"; and the plural suffix \\"-queh.\\" Tecoaque replaced the earlier name of Z≈çltepƒìc, meaning \\"at quail mountain\\" (from \\"z≈çlin,\\" quail, and \\"tepƒìtl,\\" mountain).  Site Description  Tecoaque includes a prominent circular structure dedicated to Ehecatl.Kelly, Jerry (2001), An archaeological guide to central and southern Mexico, University of Oklahoma Press. p 135 Parts of this primary three-tiered structure were restored in 1992, which has an eastern facing stairway.

World Heritage status  This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on 6 December 2004 in the Cultural category.Tecoaque - UNESCO World Heritage Centre; retrieved 3 January 2019. 1520 capture of Spanish civilians Initially, the Aztecs emperor Moctezuma allowed the Spaniards, led by Hernan Cortes into Tenochtitlan. Cort√©s turned on the Aztecs, taking Montezuma hostage, in order to control the empire through him.Aztec capital falls to Cort√©s, History Channel website. In the midst of this strategy, P√°nfilo de Narv√°ez arrived in Mexico from Cuba to arrest Cort√©s. The conquistador left Tenochtitlan in the hands of Pedro de Alvarado, who ordered the massacre of nearly 1000 Mexica who were participating in the festival of Toxcatl. After dealing with Narv√°ez, Cort√©s prepared to return to Tenochtitlan with a bigger force, having taken control of Narv√°ez's crews. But first he sent ahead a caravan of supplies and people, including \\"Spanish women and children, enslaved Africans, and other servants carrying burdens and leading livestock.\\" Learning of Alvarado's massacre, Cort√©s then rushed to Tenochtitlan to try to quell the violent reaction to the Spaniards' cruelty. Not longer after he arrived, however, he and his men were expelled, resulting in the deaths of nearly all the soldiers and horses Narv√°ez had brought. Before being completely routed, the Spaniards killed Cacamatzin, king of the Acolhua capital of Texcoco. Not long afterward, the slow caravan that Cort√©s had sent first came through a mountain pass just north of Iztaccihuatl. A recent archaeological expedition revealed that Acolhua warriors captured this group of Spanish civilians as they traveled to Tenochtitlan. The Acolhua were part of the Aztec Empire, and acted in response to the murder of Cacamatzin, their king. This expedition reveals that the Aztecs did resist the Spanish Conquest. The Aztecs imprisoned the Spanish caravan and over the course of six months, several hundred Spaniards and their slaves were sacrificed, tortured and partially eaten. The bones found shows that about 550 victims had their hearts ripped out during ritual offerings as well as hard their bones boiled and scraped clean. \\"It was a continuous sacrifice over six months. While the prisoners were listening to their companions being sacrificed, the next ones were being selected,\\" Enrique Martinez, director of the archaeologist dig explained to a visiting reporter from the Reuters news agency. When Cortes found out much later what had been done to his people in Z≈çltepƒìc, he renamed the town Tƒìcuahqueh which means \\"they ate people\\" or \\"people eaters\\" in the indigenous Nahuatl language. He then sent an army to destroy the town. ReferencesExternal links * UNESCO World Heritage Center ‚Äî Tecoaque *Aztec Massacre, Secrets of the Dead, PBS series (first broadcast: 23 April 2008).

From 1925 to his death in 1935, he was a noted Intendant of the Hungarian Royal Opera House in Budapest. Biography At an early age he had lessons with the blind pianist Attila Horv√°th, and also studied the violin. While still in secondary school, he entered the Academy of Music in Budapest, where he studied under J√°nos Koessler and Viktor Herzfeld. He taught theory at another music school, and had an extended tour of European countries. In 1919 he became a teacher at the Academy of Music. In 1924, with some associated artists, he gave a performance of his own works, including his Violin Sonata, Poems for piano, and songs. In 1925 he became director of the Hungarian Royal Opera House, the youngest director since Gustav Mahler.The Oscholars He restored the institution's artistic reputation that had deteriorated during and after World War I, and put its financial affairs on a sound footing. His first venture was to stage the Hungarian premiere of Claude Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande. These were followed by the Hungarian premieres, mostly shortly after their world premieres, of Stravinsky's Oedipus rex, Puccini's Turandot, Milhaud's \\"three-minute\\" operas, Hindemith's Hin und zur√ºck, Malipiero's Il finto Arlecchino (from his trilogy Il mistero di Venezia), and others. His administration of the Opera House was criticised not only for being too conservative and reactionary, but also for being too adventurous with new works. He introduced 17 stage works by Hungarian composers during his ten-year tenure. He also created a museum for the Opera House, containing fine art objects and historical documents.Budapest VI. ker√ºlet TER√âZV√ÅROS He was also the music critic for two daily newspapers. He contributed to periodicals and wrote analyses of operas and the Hungarian repertoire, and he wrote text books on harmony. The Opera House celebrated its 50th anniversary in 1935. He died suddenly the following year, aged only 43. Radnai belongs to the Hungarian post-romantic school, and there are few examples of any Hungarian national elements in his music, a major exception being his choral work Symphony of the Magyars. His harmonic language was mainly influenced by turn-of-the-century French and Italian idioms. He had a strong feel for orchestral colouring, and used impressionist techniques.

They criminalized entire communities by designating them as habitual criminals. Under these acts, ethnic or social communities in India which were defined as \\"addicted to the systematic commission of non-bailable offences\\" such as thefts, were systematically registered by the government. Since they were described as \\"habitually criminal\\", restrictions on their movements were also imposed. Adult male members of such groups were forced to report weekly to the local police. The first CTA, the Criminal Tribes Act 1871, applied mostly in North India. This Act was extended to the Bengal Presidency and other areas in 1876, and, finally, with the Criminal Tribes Act 1911, to Madras Presidency. The Act went through several amendments in the next decade, and, finally, the Criminal Tribes Act 1924 incorporated all of them. At the time of Indian independence in 1947, thirteen million people in 127 communities faced search and arrest if any member of the group was found outside the prescribed area.Raj and Born Criminals Crime, gender, and sexuality in criminal prosecutions, by Louis A. Knafla. Published by Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002. . Page 124. The Act was repealed in August 1949 and former \\"criminal tribes\\" were denotified in 1952, when the Act was replaced with the Habitual Offenders Act 1952 of Government of India, and in 1961 state governments started releasing lists of such tribes.Year of Birth ‚Äì 1871: Mahasweta Devi on India's Denotified Tribes by Mahasweta Devi. indiatogether.org.Denotified and Nomadic Tribes in Maharashtra by Motiraj Rathod Harvard University. Today, there are 313 Nomadic Tribes and 198 Denotified Tribes of India, yet the legacy of the past continues to haunt the majority of 60 million people belonging to these tribes, especially as their historical associations have meant continued alienation and stereotyping by the police and the media as well as economic hardships. Many of them can still only subscribe to a slightly altered label, Vimukta jaatis, or \\"Ex- Criminal Tribes\\".Colonial Act still haunts denotified tribes: expert The Hindu, 27 March 2008.Injustice, go away: Phase Pardhis are one of India's denotified tribes but the authorities and society in general continue to think of them as criminals The Hindu, Sunday, 1 June 2003. Scope The Criminal Tribes Act was one of the many laws passed by the British colonial government that applied to Indians based on their religion and caste identification. The Criminal Tribes Act and its provisions used the term Tribes, which included castes within their scope. This terminology was preferred for various reasons, including Muslim sensitivities that considered castes by definition Hindu, and preferred Tribes as a more generic term that included Muslims. Origins of the act Sociologist Meena Radhakrishna writes that the origins behind the creation of the act concerned revolt of 1857 where many tribal chiefs were labelled traitors and considered rebellious. Some historians, such as David Arnold, have suggested that this happened because many of these tribes were small communities of poor, low-caste and nomadic people living on the fringes of the society. Living as petty traders, pastoralists, gypsies, hill and forest dwelling tribes, they did not conform to the British colonial idea of civilised living, which involved settled agriculture and waged labour. Because it came to be thought that behavior was hereditary rather than learned, crime became ethnic, and what was merely social determinism till then became biological determinism.Native Prints Suspect Identities: A History of Fingerprinting and Criminal Identification, by Simon A. Cole. Published by Harvard University Press, 2002. . Page 67-68. This paradigm shift seems to have arisen out of the prevalent belief in 19th century Europe that people with peripatetic lifestyles were a menace to society and required control, or at least surveillance. Elsewhere the concept of Reformatory Schools for such people had already been initiated by mid-19th century by social reformers.English Social reformer, Mary Carpenter (1807‚Äì1877) was first to coin the term \\"dangerous classes\\".Colonialism and Criminal Castes With Respect to Sex: Negotiating Hijra Identity in South India, by Gayatri Reddy. Published by University of Chicago Press, 2005. . Page 26-27 Moreover, India posed a unique problem to the colonialists as the demarcation between wandering criminal tribes, vagrants, itinerants, travelling tradesmen, nomads and gypsies seemed impossible, so they were all, even eunuchs (hijras), grouped together, and their subsequent generations were merely a \\"law and order problem\\" for the state.Professional criminals Customary strangers: new perspectives on peripatetic peoples in the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, by Joseph C. Berland, Aparna Rao. Published by Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004. . Page 11. History When the Bill was introduced in 1871 by T.V. Stephens a British official said, \\"... people from time immemorial have been pursuing the caste system defined job-positions: weaving, carpentry and such were hereditary jobs. So there must have been hereditary criminals also who pursued their forefathers‚Äô profession.\\".Helmut Kury, Slawomir Redo, Evelyn Shea (Editors), Women and Children as Victims and Offenders: Background, Prevention, Reintegration (volume 1), Springer International Publishing, Switzerland, 2016, Page 759 On another occasion defining criminal tribe James Fitzjames Stephen testified, \\"When we speak of professional criminals, we...(mean) a tribe whose ancestors were criminals from time immemorial, who are themselves destined by the usage of caste to commit crime, and whose descendants will be offenders against the law, until the whole tribe is exterminated or accounted for in manner of thugs\\". The measure was a part of a wider attempt at social engineering which saw, for example, the categorisation of castes as being \\"agricultural\\" or \\"martial\\" as a means of facilitating the distribution of property or recognising which groups were loyal to the colonial government and therefore suitable for military recruitment, respectively. The British government was able to summon a large amount of public support, including the nationalist press, for the excesses committed on such communities. This is because the Criminal Tribes Act was posed widely as a social reform measure which reformed criminals through work. However, when they tried to make a living like everybody else, they did not find work outside the settlement because of public prejudice and ostracisation. The castes and tribes \\"notified\\" under the Act were labelled as Criminal Tribes for their so-called \\"criminal tendencies\\". As a result, anyone born in these communities across the country was presumed as a \\"born criminal\\", irrespective of their criminal precedents. This gave the police sweeping powers to arrest them, control them, and monitor their movements. Once a tribe was officially notified, its members had no recourse to repeal such notices under the judicial system. From then on, their movements were monitored through a system of compulsory registration and passes, which specified where the holders could travel and reside, and district magistrates were required to maintain records of all such people.The Criminal Tribe Act (Act XXVII of 1871) Muslims and Crime: A Comparative Study, by Muzammil Quraishi. Published by Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2005. . Page 51. An inquiry was set up in 1883, to investigate the need for extending the Act to the rest of India, and received an affirmative response. 1897 saw another amendment to the Act, wherein local governments were empowered to establish separate \\"reformatory\\" settlements, for tribal boys from age four to eighteen years, away from their parents. Eventually, in 1911, it was enacted in Madras Presidency as well, bringing entire India into the jurisdiction of this law,Ethnographers Civilising Natures: Race, Resources and Modernity in Colonial South India, by Kavita Philip. Published by Orient Blackswan, 2004. . Page 174. in 1908, special ‚Äòsettlements‚Äô were constructed for the notified tribes where they had to perform hard labour. With subsequent amendments to the Act, punitive penalties were increased, and fingerprinting of all members of the criminal tribe was made compulsory, such tight control according to many scholars was placed to ensure that no future revolts could take place. Many of the tribes were \\"settled\\" in villages under the police guard, whose job was to ensure that no registered member of the tribe was absent without notice. Also imposition of punitive police posts on the villages with history of \\"misconduct\\" was also common.Punjab ‚Äì Police and Jails The Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 20, p. 363. In the coming decades, as a fallout from this act, a large section of these notified tribes took up nomadic existence, living on the fringes of the society. In 1936, Jawaharlal Nehru denouncing the Act commented, \\"The monstrous provisions of the Criminal Tribes Act constitute a negation of civil liberty. No tribe [can] be classed as criminal as such and the whole principle [is] out of consonance with all civilised principles.\\"Bania Arrested for Spying by Dilip D'Souza. Rediff.com, 18 January 2003. Profiling and segregation The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871, expanded in scope through the 1920s, targeted numerous castes in colonial India. The law states Simon Cole, a professor of Criminology, Law & Society, declared everyone belonging to certain castes to be born with criminal tendencies. Ramnarayan Rawat, a professor of History and specialising in social exclusion in Indian subcontinent, states that the criminal-by-birth castes under this Act included initially Gujjars and Harni (sub-clan of Rajput) Lodhi (sub-clan of Rajput) but its enforcement expanded by late 19th century to include most Shudras and untouchables such as Chamars, as well as Sanyassis and hill tribes. Other major British census based caste groups that were included as criminal-by- birth under this Act included, Bowreah, Budducks, Bedyas, Domes, Dormas, Gujar, Bhar, Pasi, Dasads, Nonias, Moosaheers, Rajwars, Gahsees Boayas, Dharees, Sowakhyas. The colonial government prepared a list of criminal castes in various parts of India, and all members registered in these castes by caste-census were restricted in terms of regions they could visit, move about in or people they could socialise with. In certain regions of colonial India, entire caste groups were presumed guilty by birth, arrested, children separated from their parents, and held in penal colonies or quarantined without conviction or due process. This practice became controversial, it did not enjoy the support of all colonial British officials, and in a few cases, states Henry Schwarz, a professor at Georgetown University specialising in the history of colonial and postcolonial India, this decades-long practice was reversed at the start of the 20th century with the proclamation that people \\"could not be incarcerated indefinitely on the presumption of [inherited] bad character\\". The criminal-by-birth laws against targeted castes was enforced from early 19th century through the mid-20th century, with an expansion of criminal castes list in west and south India through the 1900s to 1930s. Hundreds of Hindu communities were brought under the Criminal Tribes Act. By 1931, the colonial government listed 237 criminal castes and tribes under the act in the Madras Presidency alone. While the notion of hereditary criminals conformed to orientalist stereotypes and the prevailing racial theories in Britain during the colonial era, the social impact of its enforcement was profiling, division and isolation of many communities of Indians during the colonial rule.  Impact on Third Gender Communities  Though it was primarily directed at tribal communities, various incarnations of the Criminal Tribes Act also included provisions limiting the rights of transgender and gender non-conforming individuals and communities in India. Hijras in particular were targeted under the Act. The Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 created the category of \\"eunuch\\" to refer to the many, often unrelated gender non-conforming communities in India, including hijras, khwajasarais, and kotis. The label \\"eunuch\\" was used as a catchall term for anyone thought not to conform to traditional British ideals of masculinity, though in reality most of the communities classified as \\"eunuchs\\" did not identify as male or female. Under the Criminal Tribes Act, a eunuch could be either \\"respectable\\" or \\"suspicious.\\" Respectable eunuchs did not engage in \\"kidnapping, castration or sodomy,\\" while suspicious eunuchs were performed in public and wore what British officials classified as female clothes. The Criminal Tribes Act banned all behavior considered \\"suspicious,\\" warning that anyone found engaging in traditional hijra activities like public dancing or dressing in women's clothing would be arrested and/or forced to pay a fine. The Criminal Tribes Act was first introduced in the North-Western Provinces and Oudh in 1871. In 1876, it was introduced in Bengal; in 1911, it was introduced in Madras. Colonial authorities claimed that it was necessary for \\"eunuchs\\" to be registered under the Act to prevent them from kidnapping children and/or engaging in sodomy. In reality, there was little official evidence of any gender non-conforming communities in India kidnapping children, or of many children living in gender non-conforming communities. The few children that were found to be living with hijras were removed from their care, despite the fact that most of the children did not have any other legal guardians and had been adopted into the hijra community because they were orphans or unwanted by their biological families. Post-independence reforms In January 1947, Government of Bombay set up a committee, which included B.G. Kher, then Chief Minister Morarji Desai, and Gulzarilal Nanda, to look into the matter of 'criminal tribes'. This set into motion the final repeal of the Act in August 1949, which resulted in 2,300,000 tribals being decriminalised.Revankar, Ratna G. The Indian Constitution--: A Case Study of Backward Classes. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, 1971. . Page 238. After independence, the Act was ultimately repealed. It was first repealed in Madras Province in 1949, after a long campaign led by Communist leaders such as P. Ramamurthi and P. Jeevanandham, and Forward Bloc leader U. Muthuramalingam Thevar. Thevar had led many agitations in the villages since 1929, urging the people to defy the CTA. As a result, the number of tribes listed under the CTA was reduced. Other provincial governments soon followed suit. Subsequently, the committee appointed in the same year by the central government to study the utility of the existence of this law, reported in 1950 that the system violated the spirit of the Indian constitution. The massive crime wave after the criminal tribes were denotified led to a public outcry and the Habitual Offenders Act (HOA) (1952) was enacted in the place of CTA; it states that a habitual offender is one who has been a victim of subjective and objective influences and has manifested a set practice in crime, and also presents a danger to society. The HOA effectively re-stigmatised the already marginalised \\"criminal tribes\\". The previously criminalised tribes still suffer a stigma, because of the ineffective nature of the new Act, which in effect meant relisting of the supposed denotified tribes. Today the social category generally known as the denotified and nomadic tribes includes approximately 60 million people in India. = Name change = Many of these denotified tribes continued to carry considerable social stigma of the Act and come under the purview of the 'Prevention of Anti-Social Activity Act' (PASA). Many of them have been denied the status of Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST) or Other Backward Classes (OBC), which would have allowed them avail Reservation under Indian law, which reserves seats for them in government jobs and educational institutions, thus most of them are still living Below Poverty Line and in sub-human conditions.Suspects forever: Members of the \\"denotified tribes\\" continue to bear the brunt of police brutality Frontline, The Hindu, Volume 19 ‚Äì Issue 12, 8‚Äì21 June 2002. Over the course of the century since its passing, the criminal identity attached to certain tribes by the Act, was internalised not just by the society, but also by the police, whose official methodology, even after repeal of the Act, often reflected the characteristics of manifestation of an era initiated by the Act, a century ago, where characteristic of crimes committed by certain tribes were closely watched, studied and documented.Colonizing and Transforming the Criminal Tribesman Deviant Bodies: Critical Perspectives on Difference in Science and Popular Culture, by Jennifer Terry, Jacqueline Urla. Published by Indiana University Press, 1995. . Page 100. National Human Rights Commission, in February 2000 recommended repeal of the Habitual Offenders Act, 1952. Later in March 2007, the UN's anti-discrimination body Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD), noted that \\"the so-called denotified and nomadic which are listed for their alleged 'criminal tendencies' under the former Criminal Tribes Act (1871), continue to be stigmatised under the Habitual Offenders Act (1952) (art. 2 (1)), and asked India to repeal the Habitual Offenders Act (1952) and effectively rehabilitate the denotified and nomadic tribes. According to the body, since much of 'Habitual Offenders Act (1952)' is derived from the earlier 'Criminal Tribes Act 1871', it doesn't show a marked departure in its intent, only gives the formed notified tribes a new name i.e. Denotified tribes, hence the stigma continues so does the oppression, as the law is being denounced on two counts, first that \\"all human beings are born free and equal\\", and second that it negates a valuable principle of the criminal justice system ‚Äì innocent until proven guilty.Repeal the Habitual Offenders Act and affectively rehabilitate the denotified tribes, UN to India Asian Tribune, Mon, 19 March 2007. In 2008, the National Commission for Denotified, Nomadic and Semi-Nomadic Tribes (NCDNSNT) of Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment recommended that same reservations as available to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes be extended to around 110 million people of denotified, nomadic or semi-nomadic tribes in India; the commission further recommended that the provisions of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 be applicable to these tribes also.Panel favours reservation for nomadic tribes by Raghvendra Rao, Indian Express, 21 August 2008.

Its last assignment was with the 111th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing, based at Travis Air Force Base, California. It was inactivated on 1 January 1953. HistoryWorld War II= Activated on 1 February 1940 at France Field, Panama Canal Zone; moved to Rio Hato Airfield just after the Attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The unit was initially equipped with 4 Douglas B-18 Bolos and 1 B-17B. On 20 November 1940 it was formally redesignated as the 3rd Bombardment Squadron (Heavy) in keeping with the Air Corps-wide policy of configuring for future re-equipment and role definition. It is known that the squadron received at least three Boeing B-17B Flying Fortresse's (including 38-222, which was lost on 2 August 1941), one of the first Canal Zone-based units to operate the four-engined bomber. It is also known that the squadron utilized a number of the enlisted graduates of the Bombardiers School conducted at France Field to alleviate the critical shortage of these specialists in Canal Zone based units. By 31 December 1941, the unit was operating essentially as an integrated unit with the 25th Bombardment Squadron at Rio Hato, the two Squadron were jointly operating nine new Boeing B-17E's, of which four were unserviceable due to parts shortages and the lack of maintenance experience of the ground crews on the type. By the end of January 1942, the squadron had surrendered its interest in the B-17E's, although a single Northrop A-17 was also on strength by this time, another being added by mid-February 1942. By mid-February, unit strength was further augmented by assignment of three more B-18's (for a total of seven B-18's and two B-18A's, plus the A-17) but only eight combat crews were assigned to actually operate the aircraft; all of whom had less than 12-month experience on the aircraft on hand. In May 1942 the squadron moved to Seymour Island Airfield in the Galapagos Islands, where its mission became to perform very long over-water patrols guarding the Pacific areas of the Panama Canal. It is not clear if the Squadron re-equipped with Consolidated LB-30 Liberators prior to deploying to the Galapagos Islands or not, but this seems likely, as no B-18's are known to have operated there. The unit did operate two Consolidated PBY-5 Catalinas from the Galapagos, on loan from the Navy. The Squadron's first wartime loss came in July 1942, when one of the fairly new LB-30s, homeward bound into the Galapagos from a routine patrol, crashed into the peak on Indefatigable Island, within a few minutes flying time of its home field. The entire 10-man crew was lost. November 1942 also saw the 3rd BS receive a full allotment of new aircraft, when it exchanged its motley assortment of LB-30s and PBY-5's for seven \\"new\\" Consolidated B-24D Liberators (as well as at least two B-17E's, although these had disappeared by February when three more B-24D's arrived), although at least three LB-30s remained on strength with the Squadron as late as March 1943 (together with a solitary Piper L-4A Grasshopper (probably 42-36727). Between 13 and 27 March, the unit was effectively stood down, as its B-24D's had been transferred to another unit and the unit was left with but one (unserviceable) LB-30, and the L-4A and \\"no missions\\" were flown. On 18 February 1943, an entire Squadron (minus aircraft and equipment), consisting of 56 officers and 320 other ranks, landed at Cristobal in the Canal Zone. The unit which arrived at Cristobal had no designation, and was simply known to its members as \\"X\\" Squadron. These men were soon to become the \\"new\\" 3rd Bomb Squadron on 12 March 1943, these crews were moved by air and convoy to David Army Airfield, Panama, where they took over the designation and equipment of the 3rd Bombardment Squadron (Heavy). In turn, the personnel who had, up to this time, been the former members of the unit moved to Anton Army Airfield and took up the designation 29th Bombardment Squadron. It was a literal exchange of station and designation between two units that has not heretofore been recorded. The 3rd BS's stay at David was short-lived, as it was off again to distant shores, this time, with its fresh complement of personnel, to Talara Airfield, Peru, (to replace the 397th Bombardment Squadron (H)). After three or four days unpacking at Talara, General Brett arrived at Talara and ordered the unit to move to Salinas Airfield, Ecuador to relieve the 25th Bomb Squadron there. Accordingly, the Squadron arrived at Salinas \\"in complete exasperation\\" as one veteran put it on 26 May. The unit had, around 29 May 1943, traded four of its RLB-30s for 11 B-17E' s (which were described as being in \\"a very run-down condition\\", although, in fact, two of these B-17E's were officially described as \\"on loan\\" to the 74th Bombardment Squadron at the time) but, as the 'new' members of the 3rd Bomb Squadron had been originally trained on B-17's, they were \\"very, very happy\\" to get them. The unit also had two Northrop A-17's (35-132 and 35-138) by this time. Unbelievably, the unit was returned to Talara Airfield by 16 June (although the \\"Official\\" USAF history says the unit was at David on 11 June 1943. The unit continued to participate in the never ending Pacific patrols but did, in fact, return to David again, starting on 11 July 1943 (by air, aided by three aircraft of the hard-working 20th Troop Carrier Squadron) the only tactical unit there at the time. The two unit \\"hack\\" Northrop A-l7's hadn't quite made it back from Salinas, as they experienced mechanical difficulty at Cali Airport, Colombia, where they remained as late as 7 August 1943, although they were finally recovered by 13 September. From this time on, the unit became, essentially, a sort of Operational Training Unit (OTU) for VI Bomber Command. Starting in August 1943, groups of Navigation Cadets were assigned for training while, during the same month, six of the unit's B-17E's were ordered to Guatemala City to assist the 74th Bomb Squadron in its patrols missions from there, remaining TDY for six weeks. This left the unit, still nominally at David, with but four B-17E's. The unit claimed its one-and-only contact with the enemy between 6 and 11 December 1943, when a single B-17E from the Squadron, deployed and operating in conjunction with Navy and other Sixth Air Force units, reported \\"contact\\" with a submarine, although the results of the subsequent attack have not been located. Patrols from David continued into 1944, but on 6 April after trading in its remaining four tired B-17E's for four arguably equally tired B-24D's, the unit moved, this time by air and truck convoy, to the relative luxury of Howard Field, Canal Zone, where it apparently received additional aircraft, as the unit had eight B-24D's by 1 July, Aircraft strength fluctuated somewhat from then until the end of the year, and the unit moved again (to Rio Hato) on 26 April 1944, and, with 12 B-24D's on hand as of October (of which 83% were airworthy), by 8 December, the unit was again at David with 11 B-24D's. The unit had suffered a blow to efficiency when, in June 1944, 72 of its most skilled mechanics and enlisted crew members were reassigned to CONUS for further reassignment to more active war theaters. This came at a particularly difficult time, as, during the same month, a resurgence of German submarine activity in the Caribbean resulted in Sixth Air Force ordering two 3rd BS B-24D's to move to France Field to assist Navy patrols in anti-submarine missions. One aircraft from the Squadron (aided by aircraft from Navy and other Sixth Air Force units) flew coordinated patrols while further detached at distant Hato Field, Cura√ßao. While no definitive submarine attacks were made, there were many \\"suspicious\\" radar contacts. By December 1944, the unit was officially described as \\"a training unit for combat crews\\" and returned again, briefly, to David, while the runway at Rio Hato was being repaired, but operational training continued. The squadron returned to David on 25 January 1945 and, still equipped with the tired old B-24D's, suffered its last loss of the war on 23 May 1945 when 42-40962 was lost at sea with but one survivor. Shortly after this unfortunate incident, the unit turned in its surviving 10 B-24D's to the Panama Air Depot in exchange for seven \\"used\\" B-24J's and three brand- new B-24M's, although two of the best B-24Ds were retained for a time. For the remainder of the war, the squadron continued as a bomber crew training unit, and in May 1945 its remaining personnel were sent to the United States. The squadron was kept on the books until November 1946 unmanned and unequipped until formally inactivated on 1 November. =Strategic Air Command= Reactivated as the 129th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron and assigned to the Federalized Pennsylvania Air National Guard 111th Strategic Reconnaissance Group at Fairchild AFB, Washington in 1951.

Founded in 1993 by Jeff Barnes and David Ebner, CafeFX was located in a studio on an eight-acre campus in Santa Maria in Santa Barbara County. Its commercial and music video division, Santa Monica-based The Syndicate, was a creative design, branding services, and digital production studio, specializing in live action direction, visual effects, animation, motion graphics, and telecine. CafeFX and The Syndicate were held by umbrella corporation ComputerCafe Group, which has also established Sententia Entertainment, a long form production company.CafeFX swims with the fish for ‚Äò≈ìEvan Almighty‚Äô¬ù  fxguide  History  After founding the company in 1993 as Computer Caf√©, Jeff Barnes and David Ebner began working in a small 10-by-10 room inside a local print design studio in Santa Maria. Their initial tools included two Amiga 2000 computers, a VHS deck, and Video Toaster. They used software such as Lightwave 3D, D-Paint, and Imagine 3D. Over the next 17-plus years, Computer Cafe would change its name and grow to one of the top visual effects studios in the world. Their first official employee was Ron Honn who acted as the company Designer and Storyboard artist. Soon to follow was VFX supervisor Tom Williamson, whose connection in the LA make-up effects industry helped to launch the group to the feature film market. The team worked their way up from local to regional and then national commercial and broadcast assignments. ‚ÄúOur first job was to show how a product called Shoe Goo worked.‚Äù said Ebner \\"and then SLIME tires, some crazy projects back then.\\" They soon expanded their client base, starting with an initial campaign on 24 spots for Foster's Freeze, and signing their first national contract for Shasta Soda. Shasta was the first US national ad spot to be fully rendered on a desktop PC. The team next steered its focus on broadcast work being represented by Our Gang Productions and studios such as Pittard Sullivan. During that time they produced various opens and TV station packages for both regional and nation clientele. Some projects include, NBC, TNT, Nickelodeon, NBC, CBS, Dateline, Entertainment Tonight and the long-running HBO Feature Presentation. Still under the banner of Computer Caf√©, Jeff and David moved into motion picture effects with Clive Barker‚Äôs 1995 feature, Lord of Illusion. Even then, Barnes claimed ‚ÄúEverything we made, we put back into the company.‚Äù In the late '90s, Barnes and Ebner were in a position to expand their operations. Interest in a Los Angeles outlet for their CG feature film work, together with a plan to expand commercially, led them to open their first LA location inside in Virgin Entertainment's 525 Post in Hollywood. A year later they expanded into their own space in Santa Monica where they opened a boutique CG and compositing studio which housed a staff of 8. In early 2002 they purchased Santa Monica based telecine company (then own by Neil Feldmen and called Pacific Data Post), added CG effects and compositing, and renamed the company 'The Syndicate.' The Syndicate was a short form visual effects company, providing Flame finishing suites, full CG services, and telecine studios, led by the management team of Kenny Solomon, Leslie Sorrentino and Beau Leon. In 2005, Barnes and Ebner also launched Sentenia Entertainment, a live-action production company. Their first project with Sententia was as Associate Producers for Guillermo Del Toro's Academy Award- winning \\"Pans Labryinth.\\" The following film was \\"Danika\\" starring Marisa Tomei, with Barnes and Ebner serving as the film's executive producers. In 2005, the pair purchased the new CafeFX studio. = Out of business = The studio closed in 2010.

His own scholarship was shown in 1834 when he published the second edition of British Antiquities Revived by Robert Vaughan, first published in 1662. He paid for the memorial to Dafydd Ionawr in the churchyard in Dolgellau, and the 1851 edition of the works of Dafydd Ionawr was dedicated to Jones. After Llanyblodwel, Jones was a curate in Wrexham before becoming vicar of Llansilin in 1811 then vicar of Rhuddlan in 1820 - a change of parish that led to his declining appointment as secretary of the Cambrian Society for Powys. In 1828, he became rector of Llandderfel, later moving to the parish of Llanaber in 1840 where he served until his retirement in 1843, when he moved to Borthwnog. He died on 6 April 1853.

He taught at Cedar Crest College from 1968 to 1976, and at the Moore College of Art from 1966 to 1968. BiographyEarly life and education= Jennings was born in Pottsville, Pennsylvania in 1918, just before the close of World War I. He grew up in a poor coal-mining town and enrolled at Temple University in the mid-1930s. After graduating, he stayed in Philadelphia and taught high school English and social studies. He then married Joan Woollcott, and started a family. After the outbreak of World War II, Jennings served in the United States Army for four years, as the chief clerk of a headquarters unit stationed in England. After returning home from the war, earned a master's degree in education and two more children were born. Jennings earned a PhD in 1965. =Career= Jennings was interested in American historiography and the influence of ideology in the case of Francis Parkman. In 1956, he purchased a used set of his works. In his reading of Parkman he argued it contained a heavy strain of American exceptionalism or ideology and revisited Parkman's sources. The Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture published his own work on colonial Indian relationships offered by Parkman in the Watergate-era titled Invasion of America: Indians, Colonialism, and the Cant of Conquest. =Later life and death= Jennings spent his last years as the Senior Research Fellow at the Newberry Library of Chicago and earlier as the director of the Newberry Library's D'Arcy McNickle Center for American Indian History.

History upright=0.95Ambulance services in Queensland first began in 1892. Military medic Seymour Warrian held the first meeting of the City Ambulance Transport Brigade on 12 September of that year. Queensland's first ambulance station operated out of the Brisbane Newspaper Company building; the first officers possessed a stretcher, but no vehicle, and so transported patients on foot.Queensland Ambulance Service History and Heritage . Department of Community Safety. Retrieved on 9 November 2011. A year after the establishment of the Brisbane centre, another was established in Charters Towers in north Queensland, eventually growing to over 90 community controlled ambulance centres. The Queensland Ambulance Service (QAS) as currently known was formed on 1 July 1991 from the amalgamation of 96 individual Queensland ambulance service transport brigades (QATB). While QAS originally operated under the banner of the Department of Emergency Services, in 2009 the Queensland Government restructured the organisational hierarchy and appointed new ministers. It became part of the Department of Community Safety, along with the Queensland Fire and Rescue Service, Emergency Management Queensland and Department of Corrective Services. As a result of the Keelty Review of Police and Community Safety in Queensland, the QAS transitioned into the Queensland Department of Health as of 1 October 2013, retaining its separate identity, rank structure and commissioner. Structure and operationsSupport= The QAS was initially divided into six operational regions across Queensland, until the Northern Region was split to form 'Far Northern Region'. This model reflected a similar structure in the then Queensland Fire and Rescue Authority. In 2012, the QAS Structural Reform Report, a comprehensive review of QAS operations, lead to a restructure of operations, and a decentralisation of control to local networks. Instead of large regions, the service would be divided into fifteen geographical local ambulance service networks (LASNs) aligning with Queensland health and hospital service networks. A sixteenth network was established as state operations centres, with the existing seven communications centres to become operations centres, reporting directly to a central assistant commissioner. The LASNs vary in size according to population and stations, and are categorised from Category 1 (largest) to Category 5 (smallest). The categorisation simply reflects their size and gives a foundation for staffing allocation and command structure. =Local ambulance service networks=Category 1 (General Manager ‚Äì Assistant Commissioner) * Metro North * Metro South Category 2 (General Manager ‚Äì Assistant Commissioner) * Cairns * Darling Downs * Gold Coast * Sunshine Coast * Townsville Category 3 (Director ‚Äì Chief Superintendent) * Central Queensland Category 4 (Director ‚Äì Chief Superintendent) * Mackay * West Moreton * Wide Bay Category 5 (Executive Manager ‚Äì Superintendent) * Cape York and Torres Strait * Central West * North West * South West State Operations‚Äì Assistant Commissioner * Seven Operations Centres (Cairns, Townsville, Rockhampton, Maroochydore, Toowoomba, Brisbane, Southport) Headquarters  There are five key central office commands that divisions report to: * Office of the Commissioner * Office of the Deputy Commissioner State LASN Operations * Office of the Deputy Commissioner Service Planning and Performance * Office of the Deputy Commissioner Corporate Services * Office of the Medical Director These commands, plus some additional senior staff, form the Central Office Senior Executive (COSE), which in turn report to the QAS Board of Management (BoM). =Clinical operations= Following a redesign in 2014, the overall clinical governance of the service is ensured by the director of clinical quality and patient safety, currently filled by Chief Superintendent Tony Hucker ASM. The office ensures that patient care services provided by officers of the Queensland Ambulance Service are delivered at a consistently high standard, and that current clinical research is included within contemporary practice. The office also responsible for QAS Policy on Staff Health and Wellbeing and setting medical priorities for ambulance resource dispatch. There are a small number of medical officers, with the team lead by Medical Director Dr Stephen Rashford ASM FACEM, who also holds the rank of deputy commissioner. Ambulance operations of the Queensland Ambulance Service are performed predominantly by its own operational staff. QAS operational staff include student paramedics, advanced care paramedics (ACPs), critical care paramedics (formally known as intensive care paramedics), patient transport officers (PTOs) and emergency medical dispatchers (EMDs). In some of Queensland's rural areas, QAS first responders provide emergency care until the arrival of paramedics, while in remote areas first responders may also work as volunteer drivers or operate ground transport vehicles (such as the Torres Strait). In some areas, non-QAS staff operate the QAS ambulances as unpaid volunteers, or as QHealth nurses as part of a hospital-based ambulance station, for example in Morven and Thargomindah. Advanced care paramedics possess either a Diploma of Paramedical Science (Ambulance), a Bachelor of Paramedical Science, or equivalent qualifications.Paramedic 3 . Department of Community Safety.

ACPs are competent in many emergency medical skills, including airway management (oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airway, oropharyngeal suctioning, laryngoscopy and Magill's forceps, laryngeal mask airway, intermittent positive pressure ventilation), cardiac management (cardiac monitoring ‚Äì basic ECG interpretation and 12-lead ECG, manual defibrillation), drug/fluid administration (intramuscular injection, intravenous cannulation, fluid replacement), and the administration of basic and advanced drugs (aspirin, glucose, glyceryl trinitrate, adrenaline, morphine, fentanyl, etc.).http://www.ambulance.qld.gov.au/medical/pdf/scope%20of%20practice.pdf Critical (intensive) care paramedics typically respond when an advanced level of clinical practice is required. In some areas, they will respond as a single officer in units known as 'pods'. CCP pods operate around the state, focused on metropolitan, major regional centers, or where a rescue helicopter is located. These ambulances are not equipped to transport patients, but contain much of the same equipment as a regular ambulance, as well as advanced equipment. CCPs are competent in all ACP procedures, as well as advanced emergency medical skills, such as endotracheal intubation, synchronised cardioversion, transcutaneous cardiac pacing, continuous positive airway pressure ventilation CPAP, decompression of tension pneumothorax, extra- jugular venous cannulation, procedural sedation (midazolam, ketamine, and droperidol.), pre-hospital thrombolysis (tenecteplase), pre-hospital direct referral to primary PCI, intraosseous access, as well as the administration of advanced drugs (atropine, heparin, ketamine, benztropine, magnesium, etc.). In addition to standard CCP skills, officers on the High Acute Response Unit (HARU) perform general anaesthesia via Rapid Sequence Induction, with the additional use of rocuronium and propofol, transfuse packed red blood cells, perform chest thoracostomy, and carry some additional pharmacology specific to major trauma such as TxA. As of 2018, there are HARU units located at Brisbane and the Gold Coast Vehicles A QAS ambulance The most common metropolitan ambulance is the Mercedes Sprinters with the new livery (see image), which is intended to allow for a uniform vehicle across Australia. In rural areas, due to the need for extra traction or rough roads, 4x4 vehicles are common, based upon a Toyota Landcruiser Cab Chassis (1+1 modular 4x4s) or Toyota Landcruiser Troopcarrier. Both 4x4s carry one stretcher patient in addition to the normal equipment found on a typical Mercedes Sprinter. These vehicles (Mercedes Sprinters) are used by both advanced care paramedics (ACPs) and patient transport officers. The acute vehicles carry one (1) stretcher and the patient transport vehicles Mercedes Sprinters carry two (2). Toyota Hiace PTO vehicles with twin stretchers are also in use around the State, along with a variety of other transport vehicles including wheel-chair vehicles. Additionally, two stretcher Mercedes 519 acute ambulances operate around the state by ACP and CCPs, particularly in regional and rural areas. Bariatric Ambulance Critical care paramedics (formally known as ICPs) often drive 'pods', as well as LARU (local area assessment and referral unit) and stations OIC's now often drive Hyundai Santa Fe's (formally using Subaru Foresters). These vehicles cannot carry patients, however they carry much of the same equipment as the Sprinters, as well as specialised equipment, with their sole purpose serving as fast response vehicles. A station's officer in charge (OIC) or area supervisors often use dual-cab Utes, serving a similar purpose to other fast response vehicles. Previously, the QAS used Ford F-series truck (Ford F-250 and F-350) until Ford stopped importing these in 2008. These are still in use in some rural areas, however are not common in the Metropolitan areas. =Aeromedical services= Aeromedical services around Queensland are provided by the Royal Flying Doctor Service in conjunction with the Queensland Ambulance Service. =Helicopter operations= Helicopter retrieval incorporates both pre-hospital rescue and interhospital transfer services across Queensland and has done so since 1979. Queensland Health contracts six medical rescue providers to provide emergency air rescue and air transfer services. Each contractor is designated a region of Queensland and has the option of providing more than one helicopter to their region. Each helicopter is typically staffed with: * 1 √ó pilot * 1 √ó aircrewman * 1 √ó rescue crewman (rescue swimmer) * 1 √ó QAS critical care paramedic * 1 √ó Queensland Health Department-contracted doctor (Crew mix can vary from base to base and between differing tasks such as SAR, neonatal transfer, doctor/nurse model on IFT helicopter, etc.). Helicopters staffed with both a QAS Critical Care Paramedic AND Flight Doctor also have the option to respond to incidents via road in the CCP's response vehicle if necessary. Helicopters operate from Brisbane, Townsville and Cairns (Rescue 500, 521, 510 (3 AW139's and 2 Bell 412's which are provided by Air Services Public Safety Business Agency (Queensland Government Air Rescue QGAir while a contracted government rescue helicopter operates from Thursday Island (Rescue 700) called Torres Strait & NPA Rescue (Bell 412).

RACQ LifeFlight operates community helicopter rescue services at: * Brisbane (1 AW139) * Bundaberg (1 Bell 412) * Sunshine Coast (1 Bell 412) * Toowoomba ( 1 Bell 412 & 1 AW139) * Mount Isa ( 1 BK-117) LifeFlight also operates commercial contract helicopters at Surat Gas Aero-Medical Service out of Roma and Toowoomba, which can be tasked to provide community assistance if available. LifeFlight also has an inter-facility (hospital transfer) AW139 based at Archerfield that is primarily for the transfer of critically ill patients between hospitals in Southern Queensland and Northern New South Wales. Additionally LifeFlight provide doctors for all rescue helicopters, and most RFDS planes (except Mount Isa). Funding From 2003, the service was funded by the Community Ambulance Cover scheme, a levy added to all customers of electricity retailers in Queensland. In 2009, the amount payable was a flat fee just above $100 annually. This amount and collection method is designed to provide a reliable flow of income to the service.The Community Ambulance Cover scheme . Queensland Treasury. Retrieved on 9 November 2011.

Some of the most common of the central nervous system tumors are several types of primary (originating from brain tissue) canine brain tumors. Examples of these include: meningiomas, astrocytomas, glioblastomas, oligodendriomas, choroid plexus papillomas, and pituitary adenomas. Breeds predisposed to brain tumors include: Boxer Dog, Pug, English Bull Dog, Boston Terrier, and Golden Retrievers.http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/101800.htmWestworth DR, Dickinson PJ, Vernau W, Johnson EG, Bollen AW, Kass PH et al (2008). Choroid plexus tumors in 56 dogs (1985‚Äì2007). J Vet Intern Med 22: 1157‚Äì65.  Common canine brain tumors  Meningiomas = Meningiomas (arising from the meninges, a neural crest-derived cell) are the most common brain tumor of dogs, accounting for 40% of all primary brain tumors. Golden Retrievers as well as other dolichocephalic (long-nosed) breeds are particularly susceptible. = Astrocytomas and glioblastomas = Astrocytomas are the most common neuroectodermal tumor of dogs. Glioblastomas are considered a subset of astrocytomas‚Äîa particularly damaging, invasive, and undifferentiated type. Canine glioblastomas are similar to glioblastomas in humans. Studies are underway to use and develop the dog as a model of this devastating disease of humans in the hope that characterizing and successfully treating these tumors in dogs may lead to improved therapies for humans afflicted with this disease. brachycephalic (short-nosed) breeds such as the boxer, pug, Boston terrier and bulldog have a marked (25 times the normal occurrence) predilection for developing primary brain tumors to include glioblastomas. = Pituitary gland adenoma = Pituitary gland tumors are very common in the canine. A productive form arising from the anterior pituitary is the primary cause of Cushing's disease of dogs. This tumor causes excessive production of cortisol from the adrenal cortex which leads to the classic signs of alopecia (hair loss), polyuria (excessive urination), polydipsia (excessive water drinking), and a pot-bellied appearance of the abdomen due to muscle break down. See picture here.  Clinical signs  Two of the most important signs a dog may have an intracranial brain tumor are seizure and unexplained behavioral changes. Seizures manifest as a 1‚Äì2 minute display of a combination of the following: loss of consciousness, lateral recumbency (dog lying on its side), paddling of the legs, tremors, and involuntary urination/defecation. Often, the only signs an absent owner may have of a pet dog that has had a seizure is unexplained soiling of the floor by a normally house-broken pet. Behavioral changes can manifest in many ways to include nervousness, barking in the corner (dementia), pacing, aggressiveness or irritation, or deviation from normal routines. \\"Doggy headaches\\" can manifest as head pressing against walls, doors, or even owners themselves. Other signs that may be encountered are ataxia (uncoordinated ambulation), circling, blindness, lethargy, and disorientation.  Treatment  At this time, there is no true cure (100% remission) for brain tumors in dogs (or any species for that matter.) In practice, brain tumors are generally considered to be malignant due to the delicate and poorly regenerative nature of neurons and restriction of the brain to the finite space of the cranium which does not allow tumor growth devoid of collateral damage to brain parenchyma. Therefore, general long-term prognosis for canine brain tumors is poor. Current treatment of brain tumors revolves around four main modalities: surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and palliative (pain relieving) care. Depending on the type, extent, and location of the cancer, any one or combination of these techniques may be employed. For instance, the first line treatment for meningiomas is surgery but may be coupled with chemotherapy in an attempt to improve survival time. Intracranial tumors (such as glioblastoma) more commonly rely on radiation therapy as surgical access to the tumor may be prohibitively dangerous.Spugnini EP, Thrall DE, Price GS, Sharp NJ, Munana K, Page RL (2000). Primary irradiation of canine intracranial masses. Vet Radiol Ultrasound 41: 377‚Äì80. Palliative care tends to include corticosteroids to help reduce swelling and edema around tumors as well as anti-convulsant medications to control seizures.

Gliders are used as alternatives to porch swings, and are also popular as nursery furnishing for assisting parents in feeding newborn babies. Because pinch points are moved away from the floor, a glider is marginally safer for pets and toddlers.

It has been highly important in folk music, folk rock and British folk rock playing, particularly in Britain, Ireland, North America and France. Definition Particularly notable in the folk baroque style was the adoption of DADGAD tuning, which gave a form of suspended-fourth D chord, usefully neither major or minor, which could be employed as the basis for modal-based folk songs.V. Coelho, The Cambridge Companion to the Guitar (Cambridge University Press, 2003), p. 39. It is uncertain who first developed this tuning, as both Davy Graham and Martin Carthy attributed it to each other, but it has been speculated that Graham may have acquired it from the oud while visiting north Africa. This was combined with a fingerstyle based on Travis picking and a focus on melody, that made it suitable as an accompaniment. Robin Denselow, who popularized the phrase \\"folk baroque\\", singled out Graham's recording of traditional English folk song \\"Seven Gypsies\\" on Folk, Blues and Beyond (1964) as the beginning of the style.D. Laing, K. Dallas, R. Denselow and R. Shelton, The Electric Muse (Methuen, 1975), p. 145. HistoryOrigins= Many of the English folk musicians who emerged in the early 1960s as part of the Second British folk revival began their careers in the short-lived skiffle craze of the later 1950s and as a result were familiar with American blues, folk and jazz styles.M. Brocken, The British Folk Revival 1944-2002 (Ashgate, Aldershot, 2003), p. 114. Initially they copied these styles, occasionally using open D and G tunings, but by the early 1960s a distinctive way of playing acoustic guitar began to emerge as performers like Davy Graham and Martin Carthy attempted to apply these styles to the playing of traditional English modal music. They were soon followed by artists such as Bert Jansch and John Renbourn, who further defined the style.B. Sweers, Electric Folk: The Changing Face of English Traditional Music (Oxford University Press, 2005) pp. 184-89. A landmark in this early period was the release, by Topic, of the EP 3/4 A.D by Alexis Korner and Davy Graham in April 1962. This includes the instrumental \\"Angi\\" which was to become Graham's best-known composition, as well as the title track \\"3/4 A.D.\\", named after its time signature and the initials of the two performers. This instrumental piece took its inspiration from jazz sources such as Miles Davis and Charles Mingus, but was in the form of an acoustic guitar duet by Korner and Graham‚Äîone of the earliest recordings of folk baroque. The sleeve notes by Korner struggled to classify the music but twice resort to the term \\"baroque\\". =Development= While Graham mixed this with a swathe of Indian, African, American, Celtic and modern and traditional American influences, Carthy in particular used the tuning in order to replicate the drone of uilleann pipes, hurdy-gurdy or the fiddle found in British medieval and folk music, played by the thumb on the two lowest strings. The style was further developed by Jansch, who brought a more forceful style of picking and, indirectly, influences from Jazz and Ragtime, leading particularly to more complex baselines. Renbourn built on all these trends and was the artist whose repertoire was most influenced by medieval music. In the early 1970s the next generation of British artists added new tunings and techniques, reflected in the work of artists like Nick Drake, Tim Buckley and particularly John Martyn, whose Solid Air (1972) set the bar for subsequent British acoustic guitarists.P. Buckley, The Rough Guide to Rock: the definitive guide to more than 1200 artists and bands (Rough Guides, 2003), pp. 145, 211-12, 643-44. Perhaps the most prominent exponent of recent years has been Martin Simpson, whose complex mix of traditional English and American material, together with innovative arrangements and techniques like the use of guitar slides, represents a deliberate attempt to create a unique and personal style.R. Weissman, Which Side are You On?: An Inside History of the Folk Music Revival in America (Continuum, 2005), p. 274. Significance As well as being a continuing influence in Britain the style had an impact elsewhere. Martin Carthy passed on his guitar style to French guitarist Pierre Bensusan who made it part of his own technique for playing French and Irish music. Perhaps from here it was taken up by in Scotland by Dick Gaughan, but particularly by Irish musicians like Paul Brady, D√≥nal Lunny and Mick Moloney.J. Henigan, Dadgad Tuning: Traditional Irish and Original Tunes and Songs (Mel Bay, 1999), p. 4. Carthy also influenced Paul Simon, particularly evident on \\"Scarborough Fair\\", which he taught to Simon,Harper p.172 \\"'Scarborough Fair' was Martin Carthy's 'big song' of the time. [...] Around the same time, Tom Paxton was invited to the Carthys' for dinner and Simon arrived in tow. The song's words and arrangement were noted down over dinner and swiftly copyrighted to Paul Simon.\\" and a recording of Graham‚Äôs Anji that appears on Sounds of Silence, and as a result was copied by many subsequent folk guitarists. By the 1970s Americans such as Duck Baker, Eric Schoenberg were arranging solo guitar versions of Celtic dance tunes, slow airs, bagpipe music, and harp pieces by Turlough O'Carolan and earlier harper-composers. Renbourn and Jansch‚Äôs complex sounds were also highly influential on Mike Oldfield‚Äôs early music.J. DeRogatis, Turn on Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock (Hal Leonard, 2003), p. 173. The style also had an impact within British folk rock, where, particularly Richard Thompson used the DADGAD tuning, but with a hybrid picking style to produce a similar, but distinctive effect.

It was broadcast every Monday to Friday at 8:00pm and 9:00pm on BBC One. Like other BBC News bulletins it was presented by a sole newsreader, on Monday to Thursday it was usually Ellie Crisell and on Friday Riz Lateef. After a minute of brief national and international news, a regional presenter provided 30 seconds of regional news headlines and a brief local weather forecast; on BBC One HD in England a national weather forecast was broadcast instead due to there being no regional variations. The 9pm edition was a pre-recorded preview to BBC News at Ten. The 90 second bulletin was axed by the BBC on 30 May 2018. History Originally BBC news summaries were broadcast during the day and were launched as part of the BBC's new daytime TV service. The first broadcasts took place on 8 December 1986. Lasting for three minutes, the hourly or near-hourly bulletins formed the backbone of this service. Morning summaries were broadcast on BBC1 and early afternoon summaries were transmitted on BBC2. Each bulletin was followed by a weather forecast. The final afternoon news summary of the day was followed by a regional news bulletin. In October 1990, regional hourly news bulletins were introduced and were broadcast immediately after the BBC1 morning summaries. By the end of the 1990s the summaries were broadcast less frequently and they were phased out altogether during the 2000s. News summaries also began to be included during broadcasts of the sports anthology series Grandstand from around the same time. These summaries are not to be confused with generic BBC News bulletins broadcast over BBC One and BBC Two at weekends and holidays. =8:00pm summary= In May 2007 Natasha Kaplinsky and Suzanne Virdee presented the show during its initial pilot in the Midlands. In October 2007 Natasha Kaplinsky left BBC News, and Kate Silverton was announced as the launch presenter. Initially, the presenter of the BBC News at Six and BBC News at Ten presented Friday editions, but Ellie Crisell later became the Friday presenter. In February 2008 Silverton left the update to present BBC News at One and was replaced by Crisell, who took maternity leave the following month. During this time Riz Lateef and Celina Hinchcliffe presented the update, while others including Sophie Long and Luisa Baldini also appeared. On 21 April 2008 the summary got a new logo and graphics as part of a BBC News relaunch. In October 2008 Crisell returned to the update. Riz Lateef became the new Friday and relief presenter. On 18 March 2013, the programme moved to Broadcasting House, along with the BBC News Channel and the other BBC One bulletins, and began broadcasting in high-definition.

High school career Strange was a standout pitcher at Springfield Central High School. He is the only player who has twice been named the Gatorade Massachusetts Baseball Player of the Year, winning the award in 1997 and 1998. Professional career Strange was drafted in the second round of the 1998 MLB Amateur Draft on June 2, 1998 by the New York Mets. He signed with the Mets on July 29, 1998 and was assigned to the Gulf Coast Mets of the rookie Gulf Coast League. Strange went 1-1 with a 1.42 ERA in limited action. In 1999 Strange played the entire season with the Single A Capital City Bombers. He had a very successful season, going 12-5 with a 2.63 ERA in 21 games started. By 2000, Strange started to establish himself as one of the most promising young pitchers in the Mets farm system. He split the season playing with the Single A St. Lucie Mets and the Double A Binghamton Mets. He pitched in a total of 29 games on the season for the two teams, with 23 games started. His record was a combined 14-4 with an ERA of 3.97, and he also struck out 113 batters in 143 innings pitched. In 2001 Strange started the season at Double A Binghamton and again enjoyed success on the mound, going 12-6 in 27 games pitched with an ERA of 4.88. Strange ended the season with the Triple A Norfolk Tides making one start, which he won and did not surrender a run in 6 innings pitched. Strange started the 2002 season with Triple A Norfolk and was 10-10 with an ERA of 3.82 in 29 games pitched with the Tides. Strange was called up to the Mets and made his major league debut on September 13, 2002. He finished the season with the Mets, making five appearances with a 1.13 ERA in 8 innings pitched. After not making the opening-day roster in 2003, Strange started the season with the Norfolk Tides. He was again called up to the majors and made six appearances in relief. His record was 0‚Äì0 in 6 games, with a total of 9 innings pitched and an ERA of 11.00. Strange finished the season with Norfolk, making his last appearance with the Mets on June 5, 2003. Strange spent the entire 2004 season with the Norfolk Tides. He pitched in a total of 29 games with a 10-9 record and an ERA of 5.25; he also recorded 1 save. However, Strange started to develop arm problems. At the end of the season he was granted free agency and signed as a free agent with the Minnesota Twins. Strange did not make it through spring training as arm issues that he developed continued to persist. He was released by the Twins and had season-ending surgery in order to have bone spurs removed from his pitching elbow. The surgery ended up being career ending as Strange was forced to retire after never fully rehabilitating from his arm issues. Pat Strange now coaches his son Brian's baseball team for fun. Personal life Strange's wife gave birth to a baby boy in February 2003, whom they named Brian Cole Strange in honor of former Mets standout prospect and close friend, Brian Cole, who was killed in an automobile accident in 2001.BASEBALL; A Teammate Remembers.

He was the editor of Srpski Glas and a prominent member of the Serb Catholic movement in Dubrovnik. Stijepo Kobasica  Early life  Kobasica was born at Dubrovnik in 1882, at that time a part of the Kingdom of Dalmatia of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. As a youth Kobasica researched his forebears and determined that they sprang from Serbian Orthodox stock from Herzegovina who had migrated to the coastal area of the ≈Ωupa (between Dubrovnik and Cavtat in Dalmatia) during the time of Ottoman domination of the interior. Since his family had converted to Roman Catholicism generations before, the young man found himself firmly identifying with both his Serbian ethnic roots as well as his Catholicism. His thinking of this matter was undoubtedly influenced by that of his great grand-uncle, Valtazar Bogi≈°iƒá who was a very prominent Serb Catholic from Cavtat and one of the original proponents of South Slavic unification and independence from the Austro- Hungarian r√©gime. Bogi≈°iƒá died in 1908 when Stijepo was twenty-six years old and already deeply entrenched in politics.  Journalistic career  When in high school in Dubrovnik, Kobasica submitted an article to a local paper that was strongly critical of the r√©gime. He was promptly expelled and had to move to Kotor to continue his education. Unable to resist his drive to political activism, further articles led to his expulsion from there as well, and it was in Mostar in the Bosnian military protectorate that he finally graduated. He pursued a philosophy degree at the University of Graz in Austria, and continued to write articles promoting the unification of the subjugated Slavic populations. Overhearing an insult to the King of Serbia while at Graz, he challenged the man to a duel from which he received a wound to his left arm. Moving to Sarajevo in Bosnia-Herzegovina, a Habsburg protectorate for several decades, he lent his journalistic talents to the cause of its unification with the Kingdom of Serbia in a greater South Slav dominated state, becoming the editor of the Srpske Rieƒçi (The Serbian Word) newspaper. For this in November 1906, the Imperial authorities arrested him for sedition and he was deported under guard to civic arrest in Dubrovnik, and forbidden to leave the town. At the time of his arrest in Sarajevo, the Serbian Journalist Association staged a rally in Belgrade condemning the Bosnian (Habsburg) Government. In 1907 he escaped to Belgrade where he met and married Pelagia Trifunoviƒá, a daughter of the former King Milan IV Obrenoviƒá by a Bulgarian opera singer, and they had a son together named after the child's royal grandfather Milan. From 1912-1913, Kobasica published the \\"Srpski Glas\\", the organ of the Serb People's Radical Party in Croatia and Slavonia. He was also the author of three monographs entitled Srpsko-Bugarski Rat, \\"The Serbo-Bulgarian War\\", Sarajevo, 1913, Finale, and Stjepan Radiƒá za vrijeme aneksione krize i svjetskoga rata \\"Stjepan Radiƒá at the Time of the Annexation Crisis and the World War\\" (1924). At the outbreak of the First World War, Kobasica brought his family back to Dubrovnik for their safety, but was promptly arrested again by the Austrian authorities and imprisoned in the fortress of Arad (in modern Romania) for the duration of the war. Stijepo Kobasica After the war Kobasica returned briefly to Dubrovnik but found both his wife and son had died in his absence of tuberculosis. He then moved to Sarajevo and then to Belgrade where he was one of the editors of \\"Samouprava\\" (Self-government) in 1926 and subsequently an Avala News Agency journalist. Kobasica served as president of the Yugoslav Journalist Association Belgrade Section in 1925 and 1926. He also served the public, being elected as an MP in the Banjaluka electoral district as the Radical Party candidate for both the electoral counties of Prnjavor and Te≈°anj to the Skup≈°tina (National Assembly) at Belgrade as a member of the Radical Party under the Pa≈°iƒá government. Kobasica married again, to Stojanka Nikoliƒá and had a son, Aleksandar \\"Sa≈°a\\" with her, but both predeceased him, his son, a medical student, dying of tuberculosis aged 21. His two brothers were also prominent in their areas, Josip \\"Pepo\\" becoming a Supreme Court Judge at Sarajevo, and Marin, \\"Rinko\\", Director of the Dubrovnik Commercial Maritime Academy.

The twentieth named storm of the 2007 Pacific typhoon season, Faxai originated from a tropical depression over the open waters of the western Pacific Ocean in late October. The storm quickly strengthened, becoming a severe tropical storm on October 26 as it rapidly traveled toward the northeast. The storm became extratropical the following day as it brushed Japan. The remnants dissipated on October 28\\\\. Although Faxai never made landfall, outer bands associated with the storm produced torrential rains, amounting to on Miyakejima. A Japan Airlines flight to Narita Airport encountered severe turbulence during the afternoon of October 27\\\\. One person sustained serious injuries, and five others received minor injuries; the plane was damaged during the event. One person was killed near Tokyo as the storm passed by, and three others were injured. Damages from the storm amounted to ¬•150 million (US$1.5 million). Meteorological history Tropical Storm Faxai began as an area of convection that persisted about west of Guam on October 24\\\\. Satellite imagery indicated broad cyclonic turning in the lower levels of the atmosphere, and a trough was near the surface. Convection consolidated around the center of the low-level circulation, and the upper-level environment‚Äîlow wind shear and good divergence‚Äîfavored development. The following day, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Shortly after, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert as convection deepened around a partially exposed low. The storm traveled northwest under the influences of a subtropical ridge to the north. At 0000 UTC on October 26, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) designated the system as a tropical depression and gave it the local name Juaning. Around the same time, the JMA upgraded the depression to a tropical storm and gave it the name Faxai. The JTWC issued advisories on Faxai, designating it as 20W; however, they classified it as a tropical depression. Several hours later, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition, with convection persisting mainly in the northwestern portion of the storm and cold, dry air entering into the southwestern portion. At 1200 UTC, PAGASA issued their final advisory on Tropical Storm Juaning as it moved out of their area of responsibility. The JTWC reported that Tropical Depression 20W (Faxai) had become extratropical around this time as it merged with a baroclinic zone. A cold front developed along the southern portion of Faxai, a feature of extratropical cyclones. Around that time, the JMA upgraded Faxai to a severe tropical storm with (10-minute sustained) winds of . The JTWC subsequently upgraded the depression to a tropical storm based on the development of a very impactful central dense overcast. A shortwave trough over the Korean peninsula provided a favorable upper-level environment for Faxai to intensify. Early the next day, Faxai began accelerating rapidly towards the northeast in the mid- latitude westerlies. An anticyclone over Japan created a strong pressure gradient between it and the tropical storm, causing the wind field of Faxai to expand significantly to the northeast. As the JTWC issued their final advisory, they assessed the storm to have reached its peak intensity, with (one-minute sustained) winds of . The JMA also assessed Faxai to have reached its peak intensity at that time, with (10-minute sustained) winds of and a minimum pressure of 975 hPa (mbar); however, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that Faxai had attained hurricane- force winds by this time, peaking at . The storm continued towards the northeast at a rapid pace and became extratropical off the eastern coast of Honshu around 1200 UTC on October 27\\\\. The extratropical remnants persisted for more than a day before dissipating over open waters late on October 28. NOAA, on the other hand, continued to monitor the remnants of Faxai, with the system reaching the Aleutian Islands on October 29\\\\. The following day, the storm rapidly intensified, with the central pressure dropping to 957 hPa (mbar) by 1800 UTC. On October 31, the system tracked into Alaska and weakened. The Japan Meteorological Agency uses 10-minute sustained winds, while the Joint Typhoon Warning Center uses one-minute sustained winds. The conversion factor between the two is 1.14. JMA's peak intensity for Faxai was 100 km/h (65 mph) 10-minute sustained, or 120 km/h (75 mph) one-minute sustained. The JTWC's peak intensity for Faxai was one-minute sustained, or 10-minute sustained. Preparations and impact Tropical Storm Faxai on October 26 As Faxai approached Japan, All Nippon Airways canceled all of its day flights between Tokyo and the Izu Islands. Tokai Kisen, which operates ferries between Tokyo, the Izu Islands and Shizuoka Prefecture, canceled some services due to the storm. Areas around Tokyo were warned of the expected heavy rains, waves up to , and high winds. Residents were advised to stay indoors during the storm, especially after sunset, and to avoid possible flying debris. Although Faxai did not make landfall, the outer bands produced heavy rains, which caused minor damage along the eastern coast of Japan. The highest total rainfall was recorded on Miyakejima at and in the ≈åshima Subprefecture of Tokyo, was recorded. The rainfall in Miyakejima nearly surpassed the record daily rainfall for October 27. Rainfall rates peaked at on Miyaketsubota, which triggered seven mudslides throughout the country. One woman was killed near Tokyo, and three people were injured. One home, two hectares of farmland, of roads, and one ship were damaged by the storm. At the height of the storm, 9,605 residences were without power throughout Japan. Damages from cyclone totaled ¬•150 million (US$1.5 million). At 5:31 pm Japan Standard Time (0831 UTC) on October 27, a Japan Airlines Boeing 767-300 heading to Narita International Airport, encountered severe turbulence from Faxai about southeast of Narita. The turbulence caused seven injuries on the flight, as well as some damage to the plane.

The range stretches south-west to north-east, where it plunges into the sea at the Cape Higuer (spelled Higer too). To the north-west, the mountain dips its slopes in the sea with beautiful cliffs all along, overlooking on the east the marshes of Txingudi, the river Bidasoa and its mouth (tracing the France‚ÄìSpain border) as well as the towns of Irun, Hendaia and Hondarribia on the river banks. The nearest relevant mountains are La Rhune, Aiako Harria and Ulia ,closing the view east to west from the south. Some people consider Jaizkibel to be the first westernmost mountain of the Pyrenees. The area is a relevant landmark on the grounds of its strategic position close to the border with France, with the range standing as the easternmost Spanish rise by the seaside and affording an unmatched view miles away, both over the sea and inland. As a result, the military has always showed an interest in the place since the 16th century when the Spanish-French border started to be drafted, taking to building defence facilities, such as the towers dotting the ridge (dating from the Carlist Wars) or the Fortress of Guadalupe going back to 1890, nowadays out of use. The northern slopes have borne witness to frequent military manoeuvres from the decade of the 50s through the early 90s, when the road to the booster station was sometimes cut off to avoid disruption and damage. Access points View to the east from Jaizkibel The mountain can be approached by motor vehicle, on foot and mountain bike. A local road (Gi-3440) winds up from Lezo, running next along the backbone of the mountain range till it snakes down towards Hondarribia at the north-eastern end of the ridge. On the south-eastern side of the mountain a dust track cuts across the steep slope sideways. The area, besides playing host to motor vehicle visitors, especially on Sunday, attracts many hikers, who find numerous paths have been signalled with GR and PR marks, with the main path (GR-121, stage of the walking Tour of Gipuzkoa) setting out in Pasaia and rising till it gets to the spine of the mountain range past the conspicuous 19th century towers. After gaining the final slopes by the booster station at the very top, the path heads north-east down green meadows, reaching a viewpoint and a small tower next. The descent continues till getting to the revered hermitage site and picnic area of Guadalupe, and on to Hondarribia. The whole stretch is 17.9 km long, some 5 hours walk. A demanding route to the top sets out from the Santo Cristo of Lezo, with the path ascending steadily across the southern side of the range roughly eastbound till it gets to the ridge and joins the GR-121 near one of the towers dotting the outline of the mountain. The long route GR 11 cutting its way through the southern side of the Pyrenees to the Mediterranean departs from the Cape Higuer at the north-eastern tip of the mountain range, with the first kilometres running by the seashore into Hondarribia. Issues In 2008 a controversial project is in the pipeline to build a large port outside the bay of Pasaia with a view to accommodating a bigger naval traffic and in turn encouraging the development of Pasaia's urban area within the framework of the wider scheme Jaizkibia, according to officials. The port would be located at the site of Jaizkibel's outer cliffs in an area of special natural interest in many respects. This has come up against fierce opposition of many local environmentalist groups and agencies, who try hard to prevent the scheme from being carried out. Cycling The Jaizikbel is often a decisive climb in the Cl√°sica San Sebasti√°n. Nowadays the hill is climbed twice in the race and during the last passage a small group of riders remains at the front of the race and are able to win the Cl√°sica San Sebasti√°n. The Jaizkibel is followed by the Alto de Arkale climb with the top only fourteen kilometers from the finish in San Sebasti√°n. Before the 2010 race, the Jaizkibel was climbed only once in the race, but the organisation of the race wanted a harder final because each year a larger group sprinted for the victory. To make the final more selective the organisation changed the parcours so that the Jaizkibel and Arkale needed to be climbed twice in the final.

The war was fought mainly in Silesia, Bohemia and Upper Saxony and formed one theatre of the Seven Years' War. It was the last of three Silesian Wars fought between Frederick the Great's Prussia and Maria Theresa's Austria in the mid-18th century, all three of which ended in Prussian control of Silesia. This conflict can be viewed as a continuation of the First and Second Silesian Wars of the previous decade. After the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the War of the Austrian Succession, Austria enacted broad reforms and upended its traditional diplomatic policy to prepare for renewed war with Prussia. As with the previous Silesian Wars, no particular triggering event initiated the conflict; rather, Prussia struck opportunistically to disrupt its enemies' plans. The war's cost in blood and treasure was high on both sides, and it ended inconclusively when neither of the main belligerents could sustain the conflict any longer. The war began with a Prussian invasion of Saxony in mid-1756, and it ended in a Prussian diplomatic victory with the 1763 Treaty of Hubertusburg, which confirmed Prussian control of Silesia. The treaty resulted in no territorial changes, but Austria agreed to recognise Prussia's sovereignty in Silesia in return for Prussia's support for the election of Maria Theresa's son, Archduke Joseph, as Holy Roman Emperor. The conflict formed part of the ongoing Austria‚ÄìPrussia rivalry that would shape German politics for more than a century. The war greatly enhanced the prestige of Prussia, which won general recognition as a major European power, and of Frederick, who cemented his reputation as a preeminent military commander. Context and causes Europe in the years after the upright=1.2 While the Seven Years' War was a global conflict among many belligerents, its Central European theatre turned on lingering grudges from the War of the Austrian Succession (1741‚Äì1748). The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, which had concluded the latter war, confirmed Prussian King Frederick II's seizure of the region of Silesia from the Habsburg Monarchy through two Silesian Wars. The defeated Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria nevertheless fully intended to retake the lost province and reassert Austria's hegemony in the Holy Roman Empire; after peace was restored, she set about rebuilding her armed forces and seeking out new alliances. =Unresolved conflicts= Though France and Great Britain recognised Prussia's sovereignty in Silesia under the Treaty of Aix-la- Chapelle, Austria ultimately refused to ratify the agreement, and Maria Theresa's husband, Holy Roman Emperor Francis I, withheld the Holy Roman Empire's guarantee for Prussian control of the contested province. Prussia, in turn, withheld its assent to the Pragmatic Sanction, thus challenging Maria Theresa's legitimacy as head of the Habsburg Monarchy. Despite dynastic links, British King George II viewed Prussia as an ally and proxy of the French, while Empress Elizabeth of Russia saw Frederick's kingdom as a rival for influence in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and feared that Prussia's growing power would obstruct the path of Russia's westward expansion. The political and diplomatic conditions that had led to the previous Silesian Wars still held, and further conflict seemed likely. In 1746 Maria Theresa formed a defensive agreement with Elizabeth known as the Treaty of Two Empresses, which aligned Austria and Russia against Prussia; a secret clause guaranteed Russia's support for Austria's claims in Silesia. In 1750 Britain joined the anti-Prussian compact in return for guarantees of Austrian and Russian support in the case of a Prussian attack on the Electorate of Hanover, which George also ruled in personal union. At the same time, Maria Theresa, who had been disappointed with Britain's performance as her ally in the War of the Austrian Succession, followed the controversial advice of her Chancellor Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz by pursuing warmer relations with Austria's longstanding rival, the Kingdom of France. =Diplomatic Revolution= Britain elevated tensions in 1755 by offering to finance the deployment of a Russian army that would stand ready to attack Prussia's eastern frontier. Alarmed by this encirclement, Frederick began working to separate Britain from the Austrian coalition by allaying King George's concern for Hanover. On 16 January 1756 Prussia and Britain agreed to the Convention of Westminster, under which Prussia now undertook to guarantee Hanover against French attack, in return for Britain's withdrawal of its offer of military subsidies to Russia. This move created a new Anglo-Prussian alliance and incensed the French court. Austria was now seeking warmer relations with France to ensure that the French would not take Prussia's side in a future conflict over Silesia. King LouisXV responded to Prussia's realignment with Britain by accepting Maria Theresa's invitation to a new Franco-Austrian alliance, formalised with the First Treaty of Versailles in May 1756. This series of political manoeuvres came to be known as the Diplomatic Revolution. Russia, likewise upset by the withdrawal of Britain's promised subsidies, drew closer to Austria and France, agreeing to a more openly offensive anti-Prussian coalition in April 1756. As France turned against Prussia and Russia separated from Britain, Kaunitz's plan thus matured into a grand anti-Prussian alliance between Austria, Russia, various lesser German powers, and France. =Preparations for war= Map of the Central European region, prior to Prussia's seizure of Silesia, where the bulk of the war was fought As Austria and Russia made open preparations for renewed war, Frederick became convinced that Prussia would be attacked in early 1757. Rather than wait for his enemies to move at a time of their choosing, he resolved instead to act preemptively, beginning with an attack against the neighbouring Electorate of Saxony, which he correctly believed was a secret party to the coalition against him. Frederick's broad strategy had three parts. First, he meant to occupy Saxony, gaining strategic depth and using the Saxon army and treasury to bolster the Prussian war effort. Second, he would advance from Saxony into Bohemia, where he might set up winter quarters and supply his army at Austria's expense. Third, he would invade Moravia from Silesia, seize the fortress at Olm√ºtz, and advance on Vienna to force an end to the war. He hoped to receive financial support from the British, who had also promised to send a naval squadron into the Baltic Sea to defend Prussia's coast against Russia, if necessary. To begin, Frederick divided Prussia's armies in three. He placed a force of 20,000 under Field Marshal Hans von Lehwaldt in East Prussia to guard against any Russian invasion from the east, with a reserve of 8,000 standing in Farther Pomerania; Russia should have been able to bring irresistible force to bear against East Prussia, but the King trusted to the slowness and disorganisation of the Russian army to defend his north-eastern flank. He also stationed Field Marshal Count Kurt von Schwerin in Silesia with 25,000 men to deter incursions from Moravia and Hungary. Finally, in August 1756 he personally led the main Prussian army of around 60,000 into Saxony, beginning the Third Silesian War. =Methods and technologies= European warfare in the early modern period was characterised by the widespread adoption of firearms in combination with more traditional bladed weapons. 18th-century European armies were built around units of massed infantry armed with smoothbore flintlock muskets and bayonets. Cavalrymen were equipped with sabres and pistols or carbines; light cavalry were used principally for reconnaissance, screening and tactical communications, while heavy cavalry were used as tactical reserves and deployed for shock attacks. Smoothbore artillery provided fire support and played the leading role in siege warfare. Strategic warfare in this period centred around control of key fortifications positioned so as to command the surrounding regions and roads, with lengthy sieges a common feature of armed conflict. Decisive field battles were relatively rare, though they played a larger part in Frederick's theory of warfare than was typical among his contemporary rivals. The Silesian Wars, like most European wars of the 18th century, were fought as so-called cabinet wars in which disciplined regular armies were equipped and supplied by the state to conduct warfare on behalf of the sovereign's interests. Occupied enemy territories were regularly taxed and extorted for funds, but large-scale atrocities against civilian populations were rare compared with conflicts in the previous century. Military logistics was the decisive factor in many wars, as armies had grown too large to support themselves on prolonged campaigns by foraging and plunder alone. Military supplies were stored in centralised magazines and distributed by baggage trains that were highly vulnerable to enemy raids. Armies were generally unable to sustain combat operations during winter and normally established winter quarters in the cold season, resuming their campaigns with the return of spring. Course1756=Invasion of Saxony upright=1.2 Prussian troops crossed the Saxon frontier on 29 August 1756. The Prussian army marched in three columns: on the right were about 15,000 men under the command of Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick; on the left were 18,000 men under the command of the Duke of Brunswick-Bevern; in the centre was Frederick himself, with Field Marshal James Keith commanding a corps of 30,000 troops. Prince Ferdinand was to advance on the town of Chemnitz and proceed to Leipzig, while Bevern was to traverse Lusatia to seize Bautzen. Meanwhile, Frederick and Keith would advance through Torgau to attack the Saxon capital at Dresden. Saxony and Austria were unprepared for Frederick's preemptive strike, and their forces were scattered; as Prussians streamed into the Electorate, the main Saxon army fortified itself at Pirna, and the Prussians occupied Dresden on 9September against little resistance. Frederick and the main Prussian army pressed on into northern Bohemia, looking to engage the Austrians under General Maximilian Ulysses Browne before they could join forces with the Saxons. Browne took up a defensible position by the village of Lobositz, where the two forces fought the Battle of Lobositz on 1October. The engagement ended inconclusively, with the Austrians inflicting significant losses on the Prussians and then retreating in good order; Frederick thus prevented Browne from reinforcing the isolated Saxons, but Browne stopped Frederick's advance into Bohemia. Turning back to the north, the Prussians fully occupied Saxony, even taking Prince-Elector Frederick Augustus II of Saxony prisoner, although he was allowed to withdraw to his other realms on 18 October. The Saxon army was briefly besieged at Pirna and surrendered on 14 October, after which its men were forcibly incorporated into the Prussian army under Prussian officers. Saxony's treasury was emptied and its currency debased to help fund the Prussian war effort. =1757=Winter diplomacy Over the winter of 1756‚Äì1757 the belligerents worked to secure their respective alliances and coordinate strategy with their allies. In February William Pitt, the new Leader of the House of Commons and a determined foe of France, persuaded the British Parliament to firmly and finally commit to the Prussian cause against Austria and France, after which Britain began delivering supplies and badly needed subsidies to Berlin. Parliament also approved the deployment of an army of observation to defend Hanover (and Brandenburg) against the coming French invasion from the west, and Frederick again called for a British naval deployment in the Baltic to deter Russia and an increasingly unfriendly Sweden, though nothing came of it. However, Prussia's aggressive attack on Saxony galvanised the Austrian coalition, and in particular increased France's commitment to offensive war against Prussia. The Imperial Diet met in January in Regensburg, where Maria Theresa won enough German princes to her cause that the Holy Roman Empire declared war on Prussia on 17 January; the Diet called for a 40,000-man Reichsarmee to be assembled and put at Austria's disposal for the liberation of Saxony. In May 1757 the Second Treaty of Versailles strengthened the Franco-Austrian Alliance, with the French agreeing to contribute 129,000 soldiers to the fighting in Germany, along with subsidies of 12 million livres per year until Austria had recovered Silesia. In return, Austria promised that after the victory was won it would grant France control of the Austrian Netherlands, a long-coveted prize for the French. Russia also committed 80,000 men to the conflict, hoping to seize East Prussia and then exchange that territory with Poland for control of Courland. Sweden also agreed to invade Prussian Pomerania, looking to recovering the territories lost to Prussia after the Great Northern War. In all, then, the Austrian coalition sought a total partition of the Kingdom of Prussia, all while portraying Frederick as the aggressor for making the first move to open war. Bohemian campaign and Battle of Kol√≠n upright=1.2 After wintering in Saxony, Frederick decided to immediately invade Bohemia again, before French or Russian forces could reach the area and support the Austrians. On 18 April 1757 the main Prussian army advanced in multiple columns through the Ore Mountains, seeking a decisive engagement with Browne's forces, while the Silesian garrison under Schwerin advanced from Glatz to join them. On 21 April Bevern's column encountered an Austrian corps led by Count K√∂nigsegg near Reichenberg; the ensuing Battle of Reichenberg ended in a Prussian victory, and the Prussian forces continued to advance on Prague. The invading columns reunited north of Prague, while the retreating Austrians reformed under the command of Prince Charles of Lorraine to the city's east, and on 6May the two armies fought the Battle of Prague. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, and both Browne and Schwerin were killed, but the Prussians forced the Austrians back into the fortified city, which the invaders then besieged.Luvaas, from Learning of the attack on Prague, Austrian commander Count Leopold von Daun advanced from the east with a force of 30,000 men. Daun arrived too late to join the Battle of Prague, but he collected thousands of scattered Austrians who had escaped from the battle; with these reinforcements he slowly moved to relieve the city. Trying to simultaneously besiege Prague and face Daun, the Prussians were compelled to divide their forces. Frederick led 5,000 troops from the siege to reinforce a 19,000-man army under Bevern at nearby Kol√≠n and assess the situation. Without sufficient force to resist Daun's advance, Frederick decided to withdraw more men from the siege and preemptively attack the Austrian position. The resulting Battle of Kol√≠n on 18 June ended in a decisive Austrian victory; the Prussian position was ruined, and the invaders were forced to lift the siege and withdraw from Bohemia altogether, pursued by Daun's army, which was enlarged by the Prague garrison. The failure to take Bohemia meant the ruin of Frederick's strategy, leaving no prospect of a march on Vienna. East Prussia and Pomerania Prussia's reversal in Bohemia paralleled the entry of new belligerents on the Austrian side. In mid-1757 a Russian force of 75,000 troops under Field Marshal Stepan Fyodorovich Apraksin invaded East Prussia and took the fortress at Memel. Advancing further, the Russians engaged and defeated a smaller Prussian force led by Lehwaldt in the Battle of Gross-J√§gersdorf on 30 August. However, the victorious Russians were unable to take K√∂nigsberg, having expended their supplies at Memel and Gross- J√§gersdorf, and retreated soon afterwards; recurring difficulties with logistics limited the offensive capabilities of the large Russian army and allowed East Prussia to hold out longer than might have been expected. Sweden, too, declared war on Prussia in September, invading Prussian Pomerania on 13 September with 17,000 men and beginning the Pomeranian War. The need to defend core territories on these fronts reduced Prussia's offensive capacity in Bohemia and Silesia. Battle of Rossbach The upright=1.2 In mid-1757 Austrian forces gradually pushed into Prussian-controlled Lusatia, while a combined French and Reichsarmee force under the Prince of Soubise approached the theatre from the west. On 7September the Austrians under Daun and Prince Charles, advancing into Upper Lusatia, defeated a Prussian force under Bevern and Hans Karl von Winterfeldt at the Battle of Moys, during which Winterfeldt was killed. Prince Charles's army then proceeded westward, hoping to link up with Soubise's force after the latter had traversed Saxony, while Bevern and his army retreated eastward to defend Lower Silesia. Deterred by the overwhelming Austrian force in Lusatia, Frederick instead led a Prussian army westward into Thuringia to seek a decisive engagement with the approaching Franco-Imperial army before it could unite with Prince Charles and Daun. The Imperials evaded the Prussians, however, and on 10 September Hanover and the British army of observation surrendered to France with the Convention of Klosterzeven, further exposing Prussia's western flank. Meanwhile, between 10 and 17 October a small hussar force under Hungarian Count Andr√°s Hadik ranged ahead of the main Austrian force to briefly occupy Berlin, ransoming the city for 200,000 thalers and then retreating. In late October the Prussian army reversed course and moved back eastward to Leipzig to defend Prussia's core territory against the various threats it now faced. After this series of manoeuvres, on 5 November a Prussian corps under Frederick located and engaged Soubise's much larger force near the village of Rossbach in Saxony. The ensuing Battle of Rossbach ended in a stunning Prussian victory, in which Frederick lost fewer than 1,000 men, while the Franco-German force under Soubise lost around 10,000. This victory secured Prussia's control of Saxony for a time, and its effect on the morale of both sides was dramatic. After the embarrassing defeat at Rossbach, French interest in the Silesian War declined sharply, and French forces were soon withdrawn from the Silesian theatre, leaving Rossbach as the only battle between the French and Prussians during the war. Battle of Leuthen Prussian upright=1.2 While Frederick's army manoeuvred in western Saxony and Thuringia, the Austrian army of Prince Charles and Daun pressed eastward into Lower Silesia. In November they reached Breslau, where they were opposed by the Silesian garrison under Bevern. The Austrians had overwhelming numbers, and in the Battle of Breslau on 22 November they drove the Prussians from the field. Bevern himself was taken prisoner, and the bulk of his remaining forces retreated toward Glogau, leaving behind some thousands to garrison the city against a siege; the commander of the garrison surrendered Breslau to the Austrians on 25 November in return for safe passage. When Frederick learned of the fall of Breslau, his 22,000 men marched in twelve days to regroup with the retreating Prussian troops from Breslau at Liegnitz. The augmented army of about 33,000 men arrived near Leuthen, west of Breslau, to find 66,000 Austrians in formation around the village. Despite his troops' fatigue from the rapid march, Frederick engaged the superior Austrian force on 5December and won another unexpected victory in the Battle of Leuthen. The Prussians pursued Prince Charles's defeated army all the way back to Bohemia, while the Austrian and French forces still within Breslau were besieged until their surrender on 19‚Äì20 December, bringing the bulk of Silesia back under Prussian control. Winter manoeuvres After this major defeat, Prince Charles was removed from his command and replaced by Daun, who was now promoted to Field Marshal. Frederick hoped the major victories at Rossbach and Leuthen would bring Maria Theresa to the peace table, but she was determined not to negotiate until she had retaken Silesia. Prussia had already exhausted its treasury in the 1757 campaign, and it now devalued its currency while imposing fresh taxes on occupied Saxony and on the Catholic Church in Silesia to raise funds for the new year. With the Saxon‚ÄìSilesian front stabilised, Frederick ordered the bulk of his East Prussian forces under Lehwaldt to reinforce Pomerania, predicting that no new Russian advance would come until after the winter. The enlarged Prussian army quickly drove the Swedes back, occupied most of Swedish Pomerania, and blockaded its capital at Stralsund through the winter. Prince Ferdinand, now made commander of Hanover's army, launched a series of winter offensives that ended the French occupation of Hanover and eventually drove the French out of Westphalia and across the Rhine, securing Prussia's western flank for the duration of the war. =1758=Moravian campaign Frederick the Great leading the Prussians to a costly victory at the upright=1.2 In January 1758 a Russian army commanded by Count William Fermor again invaded East Prussia, where the few remaining Prussian troops put up little resistance. Frederick abandoned the province to Russian occupation, judging it strategically expendable and preferring to concentrate on achieving another decisive victory in the Silesian theatre to force the Austrians to the peace table. In March France greatly reduced its financial and military commitments to the Austrian coalition with the signing of the Third Treaty of Versailles. As Prince Ferdinand's Prussian‚ÄìHanoverian army gradually forced the French out of northern Germany, Prussia and Britain quarrelled over the exact terms of their alliance, with Frederick demanding the commitment of British troops to Germany and the delivery of the long-promised naval squadron in the Baltic, while Pitt insisted on conserving Britain's resources for the wider global war. At length, on 11 April the British formalised their alliance with Prussia in the Anglo-Prussian Convention, in which they committed to provide Prussia with a subsidy of ¬£670,000 annually (equivalent to ¬£ million in ) and to make no separate peace, as well as deploying 9,000 troops to reinforce Prince Ferdinand's army in the Rhineland. Frederick decided that the time had come to invade Moravia and seize the fortified city of Olm√ºtz, as he had planned the previous year, as soon as the last Austrians could be driven from Silesia. Schweidnitz, the last Austrian-occupied stronghold in Silesia, surrendered on 16 April, after which Frederick led a field army into Moravia, reaching Olm√ºtz on 29 April and besieging it on 20 May. Olm√ºtz was well defended, and the siege was slow and difficult. Frederick hoped to provoke an Austrian counter-attack, but Daun chose to avoid direct engagements with the Prussian force, focusing instead on harassing its supply lines. By late June the city's defences were badly damaged, but the besieging army's supplies were acutely low. On 30 June Austrian forces commanded by General Ernst von Laudon intercepted a massive supply convoy from Silesia bound for the Prussian army at Olm√ºtz and destroyed it in the Battle of Domstadtl. After this loss, the Prussians were forced to break off the siege and withdraw from Moravia, abandoning their final major invasion of Austrian territory during the war. Battles of Zorndorf and Hochkirch Wounded Prussians retreating after Austrian forces surprised and defeated the main Prussian army at the upright=1.2 Frustrated in Moravia, the Prussians fortified Saxony and Silesia, while Frederick led an army northward to repel the advancing Russians, who had by then reached the borders of Brandenburg, where they besieged and burned K√ºstrin. The Prussian troops who had besieged Stralsund through the winter now withdrew to bolster Frederick's force, joining them near the ruins of K√ºstrin on 22 August. On 25 August a Prussian army of 35,000 men under Frederick engaged a Russian army of 43,000 under Fermor just east of the Oder in Neumark at the Battle of Zorndorf. Both sides fought to exhaustion and suffered heavy casualties, but the Russians withdrew, and Frederick claimed victory. The Prussians regrouped and marched back to Saxony, where they manoeuvred against Daun's advancing Austrians through September and into October, probing the Austrians' communications but avoiding any decisive engagement. On 14 October Daun surprised the main Prussian army led by Frederick and Keith near Hochkirch in Lusatia, overwhelming them in the Battle of Hochkirch. The Prussians abandoned much of their artillery and supplies, and Keith was killed in action, but the survivors retreated in good order, and Daun declined to pursue them. The Prussians hastily regrouped and entered Silesia to break an Austrian siege of Neisse on 7November. After this they returned westward to reinforce Dresden in case of an attack by Daun, but the Austrians withdrew to the west without further attacks. Winter quarters After taking heavy losses at Zorndorf, Fermor's Russian army pulled back to the Baltic coast and across the Vistula, making no further attacks against Prussia in 1758. The withdrawal of Prussian soldiers from Swedish Pomerania led to a renewed Swedish offensive in September, which progressed as far as Neuruppin; but, after failing to unite with either Russian or Austrian forces, the Swedes fell back to Swedish Pomerania for the winter for supplies. Despite their victory at Hochkirch, Daun's Austrians, too, ultimately made little strategic progress in Saxony and were unable to retake Dresden. Eventually, the Austrians were forced to withdraw into Bohemia for the winter, leaving Saxony under Prussian control, while the decimated Prussian army worked to rebuild itself in Saxony and Silesia. =1759=Battle of Kunersdorf Austrian General Ernst von Laudon surveying the field at the Battle of Kunersdorf, where his army combined with Russian forces to defeat Frederick's Prussians, as depicted by Siegmund l'Allemand In April 1759 Frederick led his main army from Saxony into Lower Silesia to keep the Russian army in western Poland separated from Daun's Austrians in Bohemia. Meanwhile, a smaller Prussian force under Frederick's younger brother, Prince Henry, remained in Saxony to harass Bohemia through the Ore Mountains, winning the Battle of Peterswalde and a series of other minor engagements, as well as destroying several Austrian ammunition dumps and bridges before retreating into Saxony. The Russians continued to press into Neumark; on 23 July the new Russian commander, Count Pyotr Saltykov, led 47,000 men in defeating 26,000 Prussians commanded by General Carl Heinrich von Wedel at the Battle of Kay. The Russians advanced westward toward the Oder, while Frederick led reinforcements northward to join Wedel and face Saltykov, leaving Prince Henry and General Heinrich August de la Motte Fouqu√© to see to the defence of Saxony and Silesia, respectively. On 3 August Saltykov reached and occupied Frankfurt an der Oder, where he received significant Austrian reinforcements sent from Daun under Laudon's command. Determined to drive back the Russians, who were now within of Berlin, Frederick joined with the survivors from the Battle of Kay and on 12 August attacked the Russian position around the village of Kunersdorf, east of Frankfurt. The resulting Battle of Kunersdorf was a crushing Russo-Austrian victory, totally scattering the Prussian army and clearing the way to Berlin for the invading coalition. After the battle Frederick believed the war to be totally lost, yet the allies again did not pursue the defeated Prussians or occupy Berlin.Luvaas, from Heavy Russian casualties at Kunersdorf and disagreement between the Russian and Austrian leadership led the cautious Count Saltykov to hold back his forces, giving the Prussians time to regroup. The Russian army's tenuous supply lines through Poland made it difficult to press home the victory so deep in enemy territory, and Prince Henry's manoeuvres in Saxony threatened to cut the Austrians' supply lines, upon which the Russians also partially depended. In September, despite the coalition's overwhelming superiority of force in Brandenburg, both the Russians and Austrians withdrew into Silesia. The coalition's internal conflicts and hesitant leadership had given Prussia a second chance, an event that Frederick later termed the \\"Miracle of the House of Brandenburg.\\" Saxon campaign In early September Austrian forces in Bohemia pressed into Saxony, which had been largely emptied of defenders in preparation for Kunersdorf, forcing the surrender of Dresden on 4September and quickly occupying most of the electorate. Prince Henry's force marched west to contest Saxony again, where a contingent under General Friedrich August von Finck sharply defeated a larger Austrian force at the Battle of Korbitz on 21 September. In response, Daun sent a relief force of his own into Saxony, only to have it destroyed by Prince Henry's Prussians on 25 September at the Battle of Hoyerswerda. Chagrined at the prospect of losing Saxony again, Daun then moved his own main force westward into Saxony, leaving behind the Russians, who withdrew into Poland for the winter. In November, while the Prussian army worked to rebuild itself in Brandenburg and Silesia, a Prussian corps under Finck positioned itself at Maxen to harass Austrian lines of communication between Saxony and Bohemia. Austrian forces under Daun and Count Franz Moritz von Lacy surrounded and overwhelmed Finck's Prussians on 21 November in the Battle of Maxen, forcing the surrender of the entire Prussian corps. Another smaller Austrian victory in Saxony at the Battle of Meissen on 4December ended the campaigning year. =1760=Lower Silesian campaign In early 1760 Laudon was given his own command in Silesia, independent of Daun, and began campaigning there in March. After an inconclusive engagement with the Prussian garrison near Neustat on 15 March, Laudon's Austrians gradually advanced through Lower Silesia, besieging Glatz on 7June. De la Motte Fouqu√© led a force to relieve the fortress, but Laudon engaged and destroyed them on 23 June at the Battle of Landeshut, taking de la Motte Fouqu√© prisoner. The principal Prussian force under Frederick started eastward to defend Silesia, but it reversed course upon learning that Daun's main army was moving in the same direction. Temporarily abandoning Silesia to Austrian siege, Frederick led his army back into Saxony and besieged Dresden from 13 July. The Prussians hoped either to take Dresden quickly or at least to divide the Austrians' attention; instead, Daun's army marched westward and forced the Prussians to lift the siege and withdraw on 21 July. Glatz was taken by the Austrians on 29 July, followed shortly by Liegnitz and Parchwitz, and the Austrian armies of Daun and Lacy returned to join with Laudon's force in Lower Silesia. The Prussians under Frederick and Prince Henry attempted to unite and seek a decisive engagement, while Daun moved to attack Frederick's force with overwhelming numbers. Laudon's corps, moving ahead of Daun's main army, attacked Frederick's position near Liegnitz on 15 August. The resulting Battle of Liegnitz ended in a Prussian victory, with the Prussians defeating Laudon before Daun's larger force could arrive to support him. This reversal disrupted the Austrians' manoeuvres and restored Prussian control of Lower Silesia, as Daun moved his army back into Saxony. Battle of Torgau plundering Berlin in October 1760, as depicted by Alexander von Kotzebueupright=1.2 A secondary Prussian force under General Johann Dietrich von H√ºlsen repulsed an Austrian advance into Saxony on 20 August in the Battle of Strehla. The Prussians and Austrians spent September skirmishing and manoeuvring in Silesia, while Saltykov's Russians held back in western Poland. With Prussian forces concentrated in Silesia and Saxony, Brandenburg was left largely undefended. In early October a Russian corps under General Gottlob Heinrich Tottleben advanced through Neumark and joined Lacy's Austrians in briefly occupying Berlin, where they demanded ransoms, seized arsenals and freed prisoners of war. However, the Russians soon pulled back to Frankfurt an der Oder for want of supplies, while Lacy's force moved south to support Daun as he sought a decisive engagement with Frederick in Saxony. The main Prussian and Austrian armies under Frederick, Daun and Lacy finally faced each other on 3November near Torgau, where the succeeding Battle of Torgau proved very costly for both sides. In the end the Prussians controlled the field and claimed victory, but both armies were badly weakened and soon retreated to winter quarters. Prussia's pyrrhic victory at Torgau resulted in few strategic gains, since Daun still controlled Dresden, and Laudon's army still had the run of Silesia; the Prussian currency had to again be devalued over the winter to stabilise the army's finances. On the other hand, the Austrians, who had hoped to decide the war once and for all at Torgau, were bitterly disappointed to have suffered still another defeat at the hands of a smaller Prussian force, and Maria Theresa's deteriorating finances were beginning to constrain the Austrian war effort. The battle left the war-making capacity of both sides so depleted that neither retained any realistic prospect of bringing the Silesian War to a decisive close without outside help. =1761=Dwindling resources By early 1761 neither side retained the men or supplies needed to mount a major offensive. Prussia could field only 104,000 troops, many of them raw recruits, and there were shortages of even basic supplies like muskets for the infantry. The Prussian army was no longer fit for the sort of aggressive manoeuvers that had previously characterised Frederick's tactics, and the kingdom's situation was desperate. Daun, the chief Austrian commander, also ruled out major offensives for the year and made no plans to even attempt to reconquer Silesia, preferring to concentrate his efforts in Saxony against Prince Henry. Austria's finances were in a state of chaos, and its economy was choked by heavy war taxes. Cooperation between Russian and Austrian forces was breaking down, as the two allied powers grew less willing to pursue each other's goals in the field. Russian advances take control of Kolberg, as depicted by Alexander von Kotzebueupright=1.2 Russian Marshal Alexander Buturlin, the new commander of Russia's forces in the theatre, coordinated with Laudon's Austrians to begin an advance in southern Silesia in April. The Prussian garrison under General Karl Christoph von der Goltz dug in around Schweidnitz, while field armies under Frederick, Laudon and Buturlin engaged in a prolonged campaign of manoeuver with no major engagements. The allies ended the campaign with a modest victory by storming the fortress at Schweidnitz on 1October, after which the Prussians fell back to winter quarters in northern Silesia and Brandenburg. Meanwhile, Russian forces under Zakhar Chernyshev and Pyotr Rumyantsev had besieged and blockaded the Prussian Pomeranian port of Kolberg beginning on 22 August. The town was strongly defended and held out well, but several Prussian attempts to break the siege were unsuccessful. In October Frederick ordered much of the garrison to withdraw to Berlin and defend Brandenburg; the weakened town finally capitulated on 16 December. The fall of Kolberg cost Prussia its last port on the Baltic Sea, and it gave Russia a way to supply its armies in Central Europe by sea, rather than overland through Poland. The resulting benefits to Russian logistics threatened to tip the balance of power decisively against Prussia the following year. =1762=The \\"second miracle\\" As 1762 began, the Prussian armies had dwindled to only sixty thousand men, and it was doubtful whether they could prevent a renewed Russian and Austrian advance to Berlin. A total Prussian collapse seemed imminent; the British now threatened to withdraw their subsidies if Prussia did not offer concessions to secure peace, a threat made good later that year by the new British prime minister, Lord Bute. Then, on 5January 1762, the ailing Russian Empress Elizabeth died. Her nephew and successor, Tsar Peter III, was an ardent admirer of Frederick's, and he at once reversed Elizabeth's foreign policy and ordered a ceasefire with Prussia. Peter agreed to an armistice with Prussia in March and lifted the Russian occupation of East Prussia and Pomerania, redirecting his armies to Mecklenburg to threaten Denmark with war over his claims on the Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp. On 15 May Russia and Prussia formally ended their war with the Treaty of Saint Petersburg, confirming Prussia's pre-war borders in the north and east. Peter went on to mediate the 22 May Treaty of Hamburg, ending the Pomeranian War between Prussia and Sweden, with all of Prussia's Pomeranian territory preserved. After signing a new alliance with Prussia on 1June, he even placed Chernyshev's corps of 18,000 Russian troops under Frederick's command; a second \\"Miracle of the House of Brandenburg\\" had occurred. Meanwhile, French morale had been sapped by prolonged British blockades, defeats in North America and India, and a lack of progress in the Rhineland. After Russia's about-face and Sweden's withdrawal, King Louis realised that France was unlikely to gain its promised reward of the Austrian Netherlands. Austria was virtually bankrupt, and without French subsidies Maria Theresa could not afford a new invasion of Silesia; with France similarly exhausted, Louis was no longer willing to finance his ally's war. Since France had never formally declared war on Prussia, he agreed to a ceasefire with Frederick and evacuated Prussia's territories in the Rhineland, ending France's involvement in the war in Germany. Final campaigns Prussian and Austrian lines facing off at the upright=1.2 With its flanks now secured, Prussia concentrated all of its remaining strength against Austria. The Prussian army, swollen by forces recalled from the north and soon to be augmented by Chernyshev's Russians, could once again match the Austrians' strength in the field, and in June the Prussians marched again to contest Silesia. However, on 9July Peter was deposed and replaced by his wife, Empress Catherine II (later to be known as Catherine the Great); Catherine immediately withdrew from the alliance her husband had formed with Prussia, but she did not rejoin the war on the Austrian side. Despite the loss of their Russian auxiliaries, the Prussians engaged Daun's army on 21 July near Burkersdorf, north-east of Schweidnitz. Frederick persuaded Chernyshev to support the attack, not by actually fighting, but merely by remaining in the area and presenting a potential threat to the Austrians. The resulting Prussian victory in the Battle of Burkersdorf led to the recovery of most of Silesia from Austrian control. Daun's forces withdrew to Glatz, and the Prussians besieged Schweidnitz, recapturing it at length on 9October. Prussia had won its final Silesian campaign. In the following months Prince Henry led a secondary army into Saxony, where he engaged the Austrian defenders of Dresden near Freiberg on 29 October; the Battle of Freiberg saw the defenders shattered and pursued back to Dresden, after which Prussian forces occupied the majority of Saxony. Prince Henry's army pursued some Reichsarmee forces into Franconia and raided pro-Austrian principalities in the Holy Roman Empire in November and December. In November Maria Theresa proposed to open peace negotiations, to which Frederick immediately agreed; on 24 November the two belligerents declared an armistice in Saxony and Silesia, and formal peace talks began in late December. Stalemate By the end of 1762 Prussia had recovered nearly all of Silesia from the Austrians, and after the Battle of Freiberg it controlled most of Saxony outside of Dresden; Austria still held Dresden and the southeastern edge of Saxony, along with the County of Glatz to the south of Silesia. The warring powers in Central Europe had essentially fought to a stalemate. Prussia's finances were stable, but the country had been devastated by battle and enemy occupation, and its manpower was spent. Austria was facing a severe financial crisis and had to reduce the size of its army, greatly decreasing its offensive power; without Russian troops or French subsidies, it had little hope of reconquering Silesia. The other belligerents in the wider Seven Years' War had already begun peace talks; now, negotiators from Austria, Prussia and Saxony convened on 30 December at Hubertusburg palace, near the front lines in Saxony, to discuss terms of peace. =1763=Treaty of Hubertusburg Frederick had earlier considered offering East Prussia to Russia in return for Peter's support for his seizure of Saxony, but Catherine's withdrawal meant that Russia was no longer a belligerent and did not participate in the negotiations. The warring parties eventually agreed to simply restore their respective conquests to each other: Austria would withdraw from Glatz, restoring full Prussian control of Silesia, in exchange for Prussia's evacuation of Saxony, which would be returned to Frederick Augustus, who would receive no other reparations from Prussia. With these swaps, the borders in the region arrived precisely back at the status quo ante bellum. Austria made a further concession by formally renouncing its claim to Silesia; in return, Prussia committed to support Maria Theresa's son, Archduke Joseph, in the forthcoming 1764 Imperial election. With that, the belligerents agreed to end the Third Silesian War with the Treaty of Hubertusburg, signed 15 February 1763. Outcomes Contemporary engraving celebrating the restoration of peace in Germany, by upright=1.2 The return to territorial status quo ante meant that none of the belligerents in the Silesian War gained the prize it had aimed at: Prussia failed to keep any part of Saxony, while Austria was unable to recover its lost province of Silesia, nor did Russia gain any territory at Prussia's expense. Nonetheless, the outcome of the war has generally been considered a diplomatic victory for Prussia, which not only retained Silesia, but also compelled Austria to acknowledge its sovereignty in the province, forestalling any further Silesian Wars. More fundamentally, Prussia showed itself to be a credible rival to Austria by successfully surviving intact what could have become a war of partition. =Prussia= Prussia emerged from the war as a new European great power, establishing itself as the leading power of Protestant Germany. The kingdom won general recognition of its sovereignty in Silesia, putting a stop to Austria's attempts to recover the province. Frederick the Great's personal reputation was enormously enhanced, as his debts to fortune (Russia's about-face after Elizabeth's death) and to British financial support were soon forgotten, while the memories of his energetic leadership and tactical successes were strenuously kept alive. Prussia had held its own while being simultaneously invaded by Austria, Russia, Sweden, and France, an accomplishment that appeared miraculous to contemporary observers. After 1763, armies around the world sent their officers to Prussia to learn the secrets of the state's outsize military power, making Prussia one of the most imitated states in Europe. Though sometimes depicted as a key moment in Prussia's rise to greatness, the war nonetheless left the kingdom's economy and population devastated, and much of the remainder of Frederick's reign was spent repairing the damage. To mitigate population losses, the King continued his father's policy of encouraging Protestant refugees from Catholic realms to resettle in Prussia. The repeated currency devaluations imposed to finance the conflict had led to rapid inflation and great economic disruption in Prussia (and in Saxony). After the war the state began using its network of military grain depots and the excise on grains to stabilise food prices and alleviate grain shortages. Prussia also established a rudimentary social welfare system for impoverished and disabled veterans of the Silesian Wars. Prussia's armed forces had experienced heavy casualties in the war, with around 180,000 men killed, and the officer corps was severely depleted. After the peace the state had neither the money nor the manpower to rebuild the army to what it had been before the war. By 1772 Prussia's standing army was restored to 190,000 men, but few of the officers were veterans of the Silesian Wars. In the succeeding War of the Bavarian Succession (1778‚Äì1779) the Prussians fought poorly, despite again being personally led by Frederick, and the Prussian army did not fare well against revolutionary France in 1792‚Äì1795. In 1806 the Prussians were shattered by Napoleon's French at the Battle of Jena; only after a series of reforms motivated by the disasters of 1806‚Äì1807 did Prussian military power again begin to grow. =Austria= The war left the Habsburg Monarchy deeply in debt, and its armed forces were greatly weakened, with more than 145,000 men dead or missing in the conflict. Austria was not able to retake Silesia or realise any other territorial gains, but it did preserve Saxony from Prussian control, slowing the growth of its new northern rival. Its military performed far more respectably than during the War of the Austrian Succession, which seemed to vindicate Maria Theresa's administrative and military reforms since that war. Thus, the war in great part restored Austria's prestige and preserved its position as a major player in the European system. By agreeing to vote for Archduke Joseph in the Imperial election, Frederick accepted the continuation of Habsburg preeminence in the Holy Roman Empire, though this was far less than Austria had hoped to win in the war. Prussia's confirmation as a first-rate power and the enhanced prestige of its king and army were long-term threats to Austria's hegemony in Germany. The Silesian Wars made clear that the Habsburg Monarchy would need sustained reform if it was to retain its dominant position in European power politics. After the disappointment of the Third Silesian War Maria Theresa finally abandoned the hope of recovering Silesia, focusing instead on domestic reforms to better prepare the realm for future conflicts with Prussia. In 1761 the Habsburg Monarchy implemented newly centralised administrative and policymaking bodies to streamline what had often been a chaotic executive process. The 1760s and 1770s saw vigorous efforts to improve tax collection, particularly in Lombardy and the Austrian Netherlands, which led to significant increases in state revenues. In 1766 the crown promulgated its first common code of laws, the Codex Theresianus, in an effort to unify the realm's various legal systems. Aiming to increase the peasantry's ability to contribute to the state's tax base, Maria Theresa issued a series of Robot Patents between 1771 and 1778 restricting forced peasant labour in her German and Bohemian lands, and her son would carry the process further with his Serfdom Patent. The state also implemented compulsory primary education and established a system of secular public schools. Beginning with these so-called Theresian reforms, wide-ranging efforts to modernise the Habsburg Monarchy over the next half century grew out of Austria's defeat.

The JD≈Ω bought three units, which it initially named D 66, later these were named J≈Ω series 761 A fourth engine was rebuilt as ML 3000 C'C', which was eventually purchased by the Deutsche Bundesbahn and numbered V 300 001 (after 1968 as 230 001). Background, design and production In 1955 the German Federal Railways (Deutsche Bundesbahn), together with the company Krauss-Maffei, took the DB Class V 200 locomotive V 200 005 on a demonstration journey to Turkey, Greece, and Yugoslavia. The result of this was that the interest of the JD≈Ω in the V 200 was awakened, and in 1956 ordered three locomotives; however, on Yugoslav railways the axle load limit was 16 t; so Krauss-Maffei designed the ML 2200 C'C', a six axle version of the V 200 with correspondingly lower axle loads.Two bogies each of three axles, making the axle load ~ 2/3 of the V 200 This was the version that the JD≈Ω procured. Additionally, a more efficient cooling system than in the V 200 was installed, as Yugoslavia has a warmer climate than Germany. The main frame was welded, the basic construction and design was like that of the DB Class V 200: In the engine room the 2 Maybach MD650 engines of 1100 hp each were located, one over each bogie, each bogie being driven by a separate hydraulic transmission, Maybach Mekydro K104. The cooling system was located between the diesel engines. Compared to a V 200 the length increased by 1.77m from 18.5m to 20.27m. The weight was 96 tonnes, giving an axle load of 16 tonnes. Maximum speed was lower than the V 200 at 120 km/h. The factory numbers of the three locomotives were 18368 to 18370. All the machines were painted blue and white. JZ D 66-001 was exhibited at the Hanover Fair in the spring of 1957 and transferred to Yugoslavia in May, being delivered to Belgrade on 27 May 1957, on the occasion of the president's 65th birthday. Operations After a short introductory period the locomotives were chartered for the \\"Blue Train\\" the government chartered train the president Josip Broz Tito used. When not used on presidential train duties, the locomotives also hauled express trains. The locomotives were named: D66-001 was \\"Dinara\\", D66-002 \\"Kozara\\", and D66-003 \\"Sutjeska\\". The names were written in silver letters on the side walls of engines. In the 1978 the presidential locomotives were replaced by four EMD JT22CW-2. After Tito's death in 1980 the locomotives were moved from Belgrade to the depot at Subotica where they worked as ordinary locomotives, finally being stopped in 1991. In 1998 the locomotives were in a dilapidated condition, and by 2007 were located in Topƒçider (a suburb of Belgrade), where they are part of a railway museum there: the former Yugoslavian government of Yugoslavia built a special building in Topƒçider for them. The fourth ML 2200 C'C' Further orders did not come from Yugoslavia as it lacked the financial means to do so. Nevertheless, Krauss-Maffei built of its own accord a ML 2200 C'C' in 1957, ready for purchase, painted in blue and cream. On the front was the Krauss- Maffei logo and on the side walls \\"KRAUSS-MAFFEI A.G\\". Its serial number was 18 416. This machine was from September to October 1957 tested on the Semmering Railway in Austria. Thus, for operations on the Bundesbahn performance measurements were available; the locomotive worked scheduled passenger trains and freight trains of up to 612 tonnes weight. The findings from these trips led to the development of the Krauss-Maffei ML 4000 C'C' =ML 3000 C'C'= In tests on the Black forest railway in October 1957 it was found that the maximum speed of the locomotives was not sufficient; this prompted Krauss-Maffei to set about the rebuilding of the locomotive. The rebuilding took place from October 1957 to May 1958, afterwards the locomotive received the designation ML 3000 C'C'. Specifically more powerful engines were installed of the type MD 12 V 538 TB 10 Maybach MD655 producing 1500 hp each. Because of the increase power output, a new transmission was also required, this was the Maybach Mekydro K184U transmission. It was painted in cream and red with a white band on the vehicle frame. After completion in July 1958 the vehicle was used on the Black forest railway and later on the Mittenwaldbahn (Mittenwald railway), and on the Allg√§ubahn (the Munich to Allg√§u and Lindau lines), as well as the Austrian Semmeringbahn. In September 1960 the locomotive travelled in Hungary, at this time the machine was numbered M 61 2001. =DB Class V 300 001= In January 1963 the fourth engine was leased by the Deutsche Bundesbahn, who numbered it V 300 001, but was initially otherwise unchanged. The DB purchased the locomotive on 17 April 1964. At this point it received the same red-grey livery colour as the V 200s carried as well as the characteristic 'V' on the nose. Initially it was used in express and freight service, and based at the engine shed at Hamm. From 1968 onwards, with the change in the numbering system of the DB the locomotive was reclassified as 230 001 In August 1970 it was based at the engine shed at Hamburg-Altona, working on daily express trains on the Marschbahn in Westerland in Schleswig-Holstein Decommissioning came in August 1975, and in 1977 was sold to the Italian locomotive dealer Bulfone in Udine Although the pulling power was good, the length of the machine restricted it from some branch lines, thus after about a year stay was the machine was brought back to Germany in late 1978 as the Italian sale was cancelled. In 1980, the locomotive was scrapped at the company of Layritz in Penzberg.

Mathematics Using the equatorial beta plane approximation, f = \\\\beta y, where Œ≤ is the variation of the Coriolis parameter with latitude, \\\\beta = \\\\frac{\\\\partial f}{\\\\partial y}. With this approximation, the primitive equations become the following: * the continuity equation (accounting for the effects of horizontal convergence and divergence and written with geopotential height): ::\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi}{\\\\partial t} + c^2 \\\\left ( \\\\frac{\\\\partial v}{\\\\partial y} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial u}{\\\\partial x} \\\\right ) = 0 * the U-momentum equation (zonal component): ::\\\\frac{du}{dt} - v \\\\beta y = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi}{\\\\partial x} * the V-momentum equation (meridional component): ::\\\\frac{dv}{dt} + u \\\\beta y = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\varphi}{\\\\partial y}.Holton, James R., 2004: An Introduction to Dynamic Meteorology. Elsevier Academic Press, Burlington, MA, pp. 394‚Äì400. In order to fully linearize the primitive equations, one must assume the following solution: :: \\\\begin{Bmatrix}u, v, \\\\varphi \\\\end{Bmatrix} = \\\\begin{Bmatrix}\\\\hat \\\\varphi \\\\end{Bmatrix} e^{i(k x + \\\\ell y - \\\\omega t)}. Upon linearization, the primitive equations yield the following dispersion relation: \\\\omega = -\\\\beta k/(k^2 + (2n + 1)\\\\beta/c), where c is the phase speed of an equatorial Kelvin wave (c^2 = g H).Gill, Adrian E., 1982: Atmosphere-Ocean Dynamics, International Geophysics Series, Volume 30, Academic Press, 662 pp. Their frequencies are much lower than that of gravity waves and represent motion that occurs as a result of the undisturbed potential vorticity varying (not constant) with latitude on the curved surface of the earth. For very long waves (as the zonal wavenumber approaches zero), the non-dispersive phase speed is approximately: \\\\omega/k = -c/(2n + 1), which indicates that these long equatorial Rossby waves move in the opposite direction (westward) of Kelvin waves (which move eastward) with speeds reduced by factors of 3, 5, 7, etc. To illustrate, suppose c = 2.8 m/s for the first baroclinic mode in the Pacific; then the Rossby wave speed would correspond to ~0.9 m/s, requiring a 6-month time frame to cross the Pacific basin from east to west. For very short waves (as the zonal wavenumber increases), the group velocity (energy packet) is eastward and opposite to the phase speed, both of which are given by the following relations: *Frequency relation: :: \\\\omega = -\\\\beta/k, \\\\, *Group velocity: :: c_g = \\\\beta/k^2. Thus, the phase and group speeds are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction (phase speed is westward and group velocity is eastward); note that is often useful to use potential vorticity as a tracer for these planetary waves, due to its invertibility (especially in the quasi-geostrophic framework). Therefore, the physical mechanism responsible for the propagation of these equatorial Rossby waves is none other than the conservation of potential vorticity: ::\\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial t}\\\\frac{\\\\beta y + \\\\zeta}{H} = 0. Thus, as a fluid parcel moves equatorward (Œ≤y approaches zero), the relative vorticity must increase and become more cyclonic in nature. Conversely, if the same fluid parcel moves poleward, (Œ≤y becomes larger), the relative vorticity must decrease and become more anticyclonic in nature. As a side note, these equatorial Rossby waves can also be vertically-propagating waves when the Brunt‚ÄìVaisala frequency (buoyancy frequency) is held constant, ultimately resulting in solutions proportional to e^{i(k x + m z - \\\\omega t)}, where m is the vertical wavenumber and k is the zonal wavenumber. Equatorial Rossby waves can also adjust to equilibrium under gravity in the tropics; because the planetary waves have frequencies much lower than gravity waves. The adjustment process tends to take place in two distinct stages where the first stage is a rapid change due to the fast propagation of gravity waves, the same as that on an f-plane (Coriolis parameter held constant), resulting in a flow that is close to geostrophic equilibrium. This stage could be thought of as the mass field adjusting to the wave field (due to the wavelengths being smaller than the Rossby deformation radius. The second stage is one where quasi-geostrophic adjustment takes place by means of planetary waves; this process can be comparable to the wave field adjusting to the mass field (due to the wavelengths being larger than the Rossby deformation radius.

Modern diagnoses might include rheumatism, arthritis, muscle stitches or cramps. Similar concepts existed in other northern European cultures. Elf-shot, associated with \\"elf arrows\\", neolithic flint arrowheads sometimes used as amulets,Electric Scotland. \\"Scottish Charms and Amulets\\" Elf-Arrows was one of the hints Tolkien used to create his Elves. Elfshot is described in the Old English spell Gif hors ofscoten sie, \\"if a horse is elf-shot\\", meaning some kind of internal injury. It was associated both with neolithic flint arrowheads and the temptations of the devil. Belief in, or at least references to, elfshot persisted into the 20th century, also in Scotland, though more modern elves seem to have concentrated their attentions on animals.The Fairy Folk attack!, Orkneyjar In rural areas country folk would sometimes find small arrowheads (the remains of Neolithic or Mesolithic flints, or naturally occurring spear-shaped stones). The prevention or curing of elfshot comes from using a charm against the sudden stitch; the three plants used in the cure are feverfew, red nettles and waybread.

Two segments together running from the Oklahoma state line to Ola (with a gap along US Highway 71 around Waldron) have been established since the original 1926 Arkansas state highway numbering, with the third segment designated in 1963. All three highways are rural, two-lane roads with relatively low traffic serving a sparsely populated and forested part of Arkansas. The highways are maintained by the Arkansas Department of Transportation (ARDOT). Route description No segment of Highway 28 has been listed as part of the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the nation's economy, defense, and mobility. =Oklahoma to US 71= The highway begins at the Oklahoma state line from Oklahoma State Highway 128 (SH-128) near the unincorporated community of Bates. The highway follows an ecoregion boundary between the flat Arkansas River Valley and the Ouachita Mountains, as well as the Arkansas Southern Railroad tracks. Highway 28 runs east as a two-lane road through the Ouachita National Forest in a sparsely populated segment of oak-hickory-pine forest. The highway passes the historic Bates School, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It continues east through Cauthron and Oliver before emerging from the Ouachita National Forest near Hon. In Hon, Highway 28 serves as the western terminus of Highway 80, before continuing east to Evening Shade. Just east of Evening Shade, Highway 28 intersects US Highway 71 (US 71), where it terminates north of Waldron. The ArDOT maintains Highway 28 like all other parts of the state highway system. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic using its roads in surveys using a metric called average annual daily traffic (AADT). The ArDOT estimates the traffic level for a segment of roadway for any average day of the year in these surveys. In 2018, this segment had an AADT below 1000 VPD along the entire length, with the highest count being 930 VPD west of the Highway 80 intersection. For reference, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) classifies roads with fewer than 400 vehicles per day as a very low volume local road. =Needmore to Ola= A second segment of Highway 28 begins at US 71 at Needmore in the Fourche Mountains south of Waldron in Scott County. The two-lane highway runs east along the long, east-west forested ridges of the Ouachita Mountains to Parks, where it passes the NRHP- listed Parks School. Continuing east, Highway 28 enters the Ouachita National Forest, bridges the Fourche La Fave River twice, and passes the unincorporated communities of Harvey and Nola before leaving the Ouachita National Forest and entering Yell County. Entering in the southwestern part of Yell County, Highway 28 continues east through Gravelly and another crossing of the Fourche La Fave River before an intersection with Highway 307 at Bluffton. Highway 28 turns northeast and runs through Fourche Valley to Briggsville, where there is another intersection with Highway 307\\\\. Highway 28 begins skirting the edge of the Ouachita National Forest, passing through Wing to Rover, where it intersects Highway 27, forming a concurrency northward. After , Highway 28 turns right and heads toward Plainview. Entering the city as Main Street, Highway 28 passes the former Plainview-Rover High School, post office, city hall, and the Plainview Medical Clinic before intersecting Highway 60 (Spring Avenue). Highway 28 turns northward at this junction, leaving Plainview and passing through a rural area before entering the small city of Ola. Entering from the city's southwest corner, Highway 28 passes Lake Ola-Dale before a junction with Highway 7, where it terminates. Much of Highway 28 between US 71 and Highway 27 had under 700 VPD in ARDOT's 2018 survey. Traffic increases heading east from the concurrency, reaching a peak of 2,400 VPD west of Ola. =Mount George to Dardanelle= A third segment of Highway 28 begins in eastern Yell County at Mount George in an intersection with Highway 154 near the Petit Jean River Wildlife Management Area. The two-lane road runs northeast through the unincorporated community of Pigsah and rural areas to Dardanelle, the Yell County seat. Highway 28 runs along the city limits near Dardanelle High School before terminating at an intersection with Highway 7 (Scenic Highway 7). Highway 28 AADT in 2018 ranged from a low of 590 VPD near the western terminus, to 1700 VPD near Dardanelle in ARDOT's 2018 survey. History During the 1926 Arkansas state highway numbering, State Road 28 was designated from Oklahoma to Ola, largely along the present-day route, with a gap along US 71. The Highway 28 designation was duplicated when the Arkansas State Highway Commission designated a county road between Mount George and Dardanelle as a state highway on April 24, 1963. The Highway Commission initially sought to close the gap in Highway 28 around Waldron in May 1973 when a new location US 71 was being constructed around the city,. but two months later rescinded the order and designated the former US 71 through Waldron as US Highway 71 Business (US 71B) instead..

It takes the name from the hamlet of Exshaw, Alberta in the Canadian Rockies, and was first described from outcrops on the banks of Jura Creek north of Exshaw by P.S. Warren in 1937.Warren, P.S., 1937. Age of the Exshaw shale in the Canadian Rockies. American Journal of Science, Series 5, volume 33, pages 454-457. The formation is of Late Devonian (late Famennian) to Early Mississippian (middle Tournaisian) age as determined by conodont biostratigraphy, and it straddles the Devonian-Carboniferous boundary.Meijer Dries, N.C. and Johnston, D.I. 1996. Famennian and Tournaisian biostratigraphy of the Big Valley, Exshaw and Bakken Formations, southeastern Alberta and Southwestern Saskatchewan. Bulletin of Canadian Petroleum Geology, vol. 44, no. 4, p. 683-694. The Exshaw strata were deposited in a marine setting during the Hangenberg event, an oceanic anoxic event associated with the Late Devonian extinction. The black shales of the Exshaw Formation are rich in organic matter and are one of the most important petroleum source rocks of the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.Caplan, M.L. and Bustin, R.M. 1996. Factors governing organic matter accumulation and preservation in a marine petroleum source rock from the Upper Devonian to Lower Carboniferous Exshaw Formation, Alberta. Bulletin of Canadian Petroleum Geology, vol. 44, no. 3, p. 474-494. Lithology and Environment of Deposition The Exshaw Formation is informally subdivided into a lower shale member and an upper siltstone and limestone member. The lower shales are dark grey to black, thin-bedded to laminated, and rich in organic matter, with scattered sulphide and phosphate nodules. There is no evidence of disturbance by biological activity. They are believed to have been deposited in an offshore environment on the outer continental shelf under anoxic conditions. The shales are sparsely fossiliferous and contain some conodont elements, ostracods and brachiopod shells. The upper member consists of brown-weathering, medium- to thick-bedded, calcareous and dolomitic siltstones with subordinate silty limestones.Glass, D.J. (editor) 1997. Lexicon of Canadian Stratigraphy, vol. 4, Western Canada including eastern British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and southern Manitoba. Canadian Society of Petroleum Geologists, Calgary, 1423 p. on CD-ROM. . Bioturbation by burrowing marine organisms is common and indicates that they were deposited in an oxygenated environment, closer to the paleocoastline than the lower black shales were. Thickness and Distribution The Exshaw Formation has a thickness of at its type locality near Exshaw and typically ranges between and thick. It is a widespread unit that can be seen in outcrop at many locations in the Canadian Rockies, and it is present in the subsurface from the prairies of northern Montana to southern Northwest Territories. It is absent at the Peace River Arch, and the upper siltstone member is absent in central Alberta and northern Alberta. Relationship to other units Because the Exshaw Formation is a widespread unit, it overlies different formations in different areas. It rests disconformably on the Wabamun Formation in the Alberta plains, the Kotcho Formation in northeastern British Columbia, and the Palliser Formation in the Canadian Rockies and foothills. It is disconformably overlain by the Banff Formation in most areas. The Exshaw Formation is equivalent to the lower and middle members of the Bakken Formation in southern Alberta, southern Saskatchewan, Montana and North Dakota.

Rugg is a stubborn and angry man, born about 1730. He rides out into a thunderstorm in the year of the Boston Massacre (1770), and is cursed to drive his carriage till the end of time. Travelers claim to have sighted him along one road or another, driving a carriage with a child at his side, and declaring that he will reach Boston by nightfall.Peter Rugg, The Missing Man. 1882 edition in Internet Archive. Origin Rugg is often assumed to be a folk character out of New England legends. Actually he was simply made up in 1824 by attorney and writer William Austin (1788‚Äì1841). Austin, writing under the pseudonym \\"Jonathan Dunwell,\\" wrote the tale \\"Peter Rugg: The Missing Man\\" in an epistolary style that suggested reportage. Initially the Rugg story appeared in The New England Magazine, a Boston Masonic periodical. When reprinted by The New England Galaxy almost immediately afterwards, many readers took it to be a nonfiction account. When readers wrote into the Galaxy asking for further news and references about the Rugg legend, Austin/Dunwell obliged with two further tales, in which Rugg is reported as having been sighted in New York, Virginia and elsewhere.\\"Peter Rugg, the Missing Man\\" or The Eclipsing Revolution: an Essay on the Supernatural, from [Oracle]Cursed in New England, by Joseph A. Citro, 2004 In an epilogue to the original story, also written by \\"Dunwell,\\" Rugg finally arrives home after nearly 60 years, only to find that his wife has died, his old mansion has been torn down, and the site has been auctioned off for building lots. The fictional origin of the story is sometimes forgotten or ignored even in modern publications. For instance, Daniel Cohen in his The Encyclopedia of Ghosts (1994) presents the story as an actual report of a supernatural phenomenon, confounding Austin with his fictional first-person narrator: \\"A complete version of this story is said to come in a letter from a man named William Austin, who claimed to have actually seen and spoken with the ghost. In the letter Austin said that he first encountered the wanderer in 1826 when he was taking a coach out of Boston ...\\"Cohen, Daniel: The Encyclopedia of Ghosts. Michael O'Mara Books Ltd, 1994, p. 254: \\"The Ghostly Wanderer.\\" Later use The story is said to have had a profound effect on the young Nathaniel Hawthorne when he was a student at Bowdoin.Alexander Woollcott, [comment in 1937 reprint]http://gaslight.mtroyal.ca/PetrRugg.htm Peter Rugg is mentioned in Hawthorne's story, \\"The Virtuoso's Collection,\\" in Mosses from an Old Manse (1842). Herman Melville's title character in \\"Bartleby the Scrivener\\" seems to allude to Rugg's wandering.In The Continuum Encyclopedia of American Literature, by Steven R. Serafin, Alfred Bendixen, Rugg is even been claimed as an inspiration for \\"The M.T.A. Song\\" about the man who boarded the Boston subway and never returned, written in 1949 but popularized in 1960 by the Kingston Trio. Two women poets of New England wrote long verse based on the Rugg story. Louise Imogen Guiney, in ‚ÄùPeter Rugg, the Bostonian,‚Äú published in Scribner‚Äôs Magazine (December 1891), gave a new version of the story in which the wandering Rugg was accompanied by his \\"little son\\" rather than the ten-year-old daughter, Jenny, who was the child in the original tale. Amy Lowell published her prose-poem ballad ‚ÄùBefore the Storm: the Legend of Peter Rugg‚Äú in The North American Review (September 1917). In Lowell's piece, Rugg drives through Boston but does not recognize it after many years. Both poets recalled the Rugg story as a ghost tale from their childhood, and evidently were unaware of its literary origin in Austin's stories. According to Alexander Woollcott, Rudyard Kipling and his English publisher A.S. Frere-Reeves were largely responsible for rediscovering Austin and publicizing the origins of the Peter Rugg tale.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 3, 1988. ArchitectureExterior= The farm's main structure is the Scanlon Log House, a two-story log structure built around 1840 by the Larimore family and acquired by the Scanlon family in the 1860s. It is a folk house of the Midland tradition, in the early German settlement era pattern. The house is one room deep and linear in design with external chimneys on both gable ends of the house. The logs in its construction are squared, hand-hewn, and laid horizontally, notched on the ends, and with narrow chinking. (Chinking refers to the mortar between the logs). There are vertical end logs that serve to anchor the structure's four corners. The two massive stone chimneys are original to the house, although the east side has been partially rebuilt. The side-gable roof is moderately pitched and is composed of slate. The Scanlon Log House was constructed in two sections: the east side being the original section built by the Larimore family and the western half was added around 1865 by Thomas Scanlon shortly after the Scanlon family acquired the property. To the rear of the house and slightly to the west stands the remains of a large stone chimney. This chimney (circa 1840) served the detached kitchen which itself disappeared in the 19th century. =Interior= The interior of the Scanlon Log House consists of a \\"two rooms over two rooms\\" arrangement with a narrow winding staircase connecting the two floors. The two bedrooms on the second floor are slightly smaller than their corresponding rooms on the first floor, with a small connecting room. Overhead beams are exposed on the interior, and the interior walls are composed of unadorned vertical wood siding. A wooden mantelpiece graces the end of the first floor parlor. Much of the furnishings on the interior are original Scanlon family pieces. =Contributing structures= To the rear of the Scanlon Log House are two adjacent outbuildings, both dating from the 19th century. One is a one-story, wood-frame, gable- roof smoke house with wide vertical siding. Next to it is a slightly smaller gable-roof, wood outbuilding that serves as a privy. The privy is characterized by whitewashed vertical narrow boards and some slightly decorative woodwork over the door and along the roof line on the exterior. Also on the Scanlon Farm is the two- story, gable-roof, wood-sided barn constructed in the 19th century.

It was the occasion for Reverend Martin Luther King Jr.'s Give Us the Ballot speech. Background The demonstration was planned to mark the third anniversary of the Brown v. Board of Education (1954), a landmark Supreme Court decision ruling that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. The event organizers urged the government to implement that decision, as the process of desegregation was being obstructed in much of the South at local and state levels. The march was organized by A. Philip Randolph, Bayard Rustin, and Ella Baker. It was supported by the NAACP and the recently founded Southern Christian Leadership Conference. Congressman Adam Clayton Powell Jr. (D-NY) had asked the planners to avoid embarrassing the Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower administration, and they organized the event as a prayer commemoration. A call for the demonstration was issued on April 5, 1957, by Randolph, Martin Luther King Jr., and Roy Wilkins. According to King, Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers, sent letters to all of his local unions, requesting members to attend the march and provide financial support. Demonstration The three-hour demonstration was held in front of the Lincoln Memorial on the Mall. Mahalia Jackson and Harry Belafonte participated in the event. Paul Robeson and his wife Eslanda attended, but were largely ignored. Among the speakers were Wilkins, Mordecai Johnson, and King. King was the last speaker and it was the first time that he addressed a national audience.CBS: May 17, 1957 He identified restoration and enforcement of voting rights for blacks as an important part of the civil rights struggle. About 25,000 demonstrators attended the event to pray and voice their opinion. At the time, the event was the largest demonstration ever organized for civil rights. =\\"Give Us the Ballot\\"= King's speech is referred to as Give Us the Ballot, as he repeated this demand as a litany, followed by a listing of changes that would result by African Americans regaining voting rights: It is one of King's major speeches. Results With this speech, King established himself as the \\"No. 1 leader of 16 million Negroes\\", according to James L. Hicks, of the Amsterdam News). His call for the ballot eventually helped inspire such events as the Selma Voting Rights Movement, its related Selma to Montgomery March, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The organizers gained experience and the march laid the foundation for additional, larger Civil Rights Movement demonstrations in Washington.

Most of the 17 coastal states have their capitals lying near the coast, exceptions being Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul), Curitiba (Paran√°), S√£o Paulo (S√£o Paulo), Teresina (Piau√≠), Bel√©m (Par√°) and Macap√° (Amap√°). Porto Alegre, Bel√©m, Teresina and Macap√° lie all near large navigable rivers, though.

The southernmost point of Brazil is located near the sea, at the border with Uruguay, within the municipality of Santa Vit√≥ria do Palmar. A few kilometers to the north lies the Praia do Cassino, which is 245 km long (though other sources measure it as 212 km long). It is considered (especially by those within the country) to be the longest beach in the world, although other beaches around the globe are also put forward as the record holders. Nevertheless, it is indeed the longest in Brazil. Satellite view of Ilha de Santa Catarina, one of the largest sea islands of Brazil. Florian√≥polis, the capital of Santa Catarina, is located at one of the largest coastal islands of Brazil, the Ilha de Santa Catarina, with an area of 424,4 km¬≤.\\"Florian√≥polis, cidade encantada\\" at Santa Catarina's official government website The Serra do Mar mountain range starts in Santa Catarina, and runs along the coastlines of Paran√°, S√£o Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Esp√≠rito Santo. The coastline of Paran√° is small if compared to other states. However, it is very diverse geographically, with a considerable number of islands and bays. In S√£o Paulo, there are famous coastal cities like Guaruj√°, S√£o Sebasti√£o and Ilhabela. The northern half of the coastline of S√£o Paulo, as well as half the coastline of Rio de Janeiro are the only ones in Brazil to face the south (if small bays and islands spread in the rest of the country are not taken into account). The state of Rio de Janeiro's coastline is remarkable for the worldwide known beaches in the capital city, like Ipanema and Copacabana. Also, the state features the Campos Basin, the largest petroleum rich area in Brazil, measuring 100,000 km¬≤ and producing 1.49 million barrels of oil every day. Bacia de Campos - A maior reserva de petr√≥leo do Brasil The basin extends to the coastline of Esp√≠rito Santo. 1,200 km east of Vit√≥ria, in Esp√≠rito Santo, lie the islands of Trindade and Martim Vaz. Bahia has the longest coastline of the Brazilian states, and also the greatest number of coastal municipalities.

Salvador was the first capital of Brazil, and still boasts well-preserved buildings of the colonial and imperial periods of Brazil. Maragogi, Alagoas. From Sergipe to Cear√°, the landscape changes little. The majority of the coastal areas have few or no mountains, whereas most of the islands are separated from the continent only by narrow channels.

Four cities (Cajueiro da Praia, Ilha Grande Lu√≠s Correia and Parna√≠ba) make up the coast of the state. In Maranh√£o, some unique geographical features (like the Len√ß√≥is Maranhenses) are present. The area between Maranh√£o and Par√° is dominated by the \\"Reentr√¢ncias Maranhenses\\", a landform similar to a fjord but shorter, narrower and lower. Because of this particular geography, there are almost no beaches at this section of the Brazilian coastline. Half the coastline of Par√° is composed of the mouth of the Amazon River, which flows towards the sea around the Maraj√≥ island, the largest island surrounded by fresh water in the world.Island Superlatives The outflow of the Amazon river is so strong that the ocean waters in the north and northeast faces of the island have almost no salt. Amap√°'s coastline is almost 600 km long, but there are only three beaches: Fazendinha, Boca do Inferno and Goiabal. The coastline of Brazil ends at Cape Orange, in the city of Oiapoque.

Nearby localities include Mayadin and al-Asharah to the east, al-Taybah and Raqqa to the north, Salamiyah to the west, Arak and Tadmur (Palmyra) to the southwest. According to Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS), al-Sukhnah had a population of 16,173 in the 2004 census. It is the administrative center of the al-Sukhnah nahiyah (\\"subdistrict\\") which consists of six localities with a collective population of 21,880 in the 2004 census.General Census of Population and Housing 2004. Syria Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). Homs Governorate. The town's inhabitants are predominantly Sunni Muslims.Boulanger, 1966, p. 357.Smith, 1841, p. 174. Al-Sukhnah has attracted hundreds of residents from nearby villages in the 20th century and is currently a processing center for natural gas. Etymology Al-Sukhnah means \\"the Warm\\" in Arabic, and is so named because of the nearby sulphur springs. As late as the early 20th century, the inhabitants of the village would bathe in the hot springs. History In 634, following the capture of Arak by the Rashidun army of Khalid ibn Walid, Sikne peacefully received the Muslim force upon hearing the generous surrender terms negotiated for Arak.Akram, 1970, pp. 321‚Äì322. In 1225, al-Sukhnah was described by Arab geographer Yaqut al-Hamawi as \\"a small town in the Syrian Desert, lying between Tadmur and 'Urd and Arak. Beside its spring are palm trees. It is on the road of one going to Damascus from Raqqa, and you come to it before reaching Arak.\\" In the mid-14th century, Ibn Batuta wrote that al-Sukhnah was \\"a pretty town\\", with a mostly Christian population. He noted that the al-Sukhnah received its name from the heat of its water, and that there were bathhouses in the town.le Strange, 1890, p. 539. Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries, al-Sukhnah served as an important trade center in the Syrian Desert among the inhabitants of nearby villages and various Bedouin tribes. In particular, the Sawakhina (\\"people from al-Sukhnah\\"), were integral in the commerce with the 'Anizzah tribal confederation. Unlike most Bedouin groups, the 'Anizzah did not maintain economic relations with the inland villages of Syria and their trade with al-Sukhnah was unique. The 'Anizzah would trade camels, horses, alkali ashes and leather while merchants from al- Sukhnah marketed wheat, clothing, arms and utensils.Douwes, 2000, pp. 39-40. By the mid-19th-century, however, its role decreased with the rise of Deir ez- Zor, and many of its inhabitants migrated to that city and to Aleppo, Homs and Hama. In the early 20th-century, al-Sukhnah had about 100 houses and a large, fortified outpost manned by an Ottoman garrison. Its inhabitants were impoverished and were engaged in the subsistence farming of grain. However, until the present day, al-Sukhnah continues to function as a trading center between its residents and the tribes in its vicinity, such as the 'Umur and the Sba'a, two sub-branches of the 'Anizzah.Douwes, 2000, p. 32. After a number of unsuccessful attempts, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria captured the town on 13 May 2015, as part of their wider offensive to control Tadmur (Palmyra) and the Syrian Desert, a strategic area that is key to ISIS supply lines and an area with numerous oil wells. During the battle for al-Sukhnah, the Syrian Army incurred 70 fatalities, while ISIS lost 40 of its militants. About 1,800 families fled the town for safety in Tadmur. Following their capture of al-Sukhnah, ISIS militants executed 26 civilians, beheading ten of them. Since the final Palmyra offensive in February 2017, a battle which resulted in a major Syrian Army victory, the Syrian Armed Forces have made advances along the Palmyra-Al Sukhnah Road. By 27 July 2017, the government forces had reached and captured strategic hills less than two kilometres from the town. On 6 August 2017, the government forces recaptured the town of Al Sukhnah in the Central Syria offensive. This leaves the road open to the besieged city of Deir ez-Zor.BREAKING: Syrian Army, allies liberate al-Sukhnah town from ISIS in east HomsRegime forces control the last city controlled by the ‚ÄúIslamic State‚Äù organization in Homs province Economy The residents of Sukhnah were linked to the different tribes in the region through various hierarchical economic ties. They paid the levy on their grain harvest to the Sba'a, who in return protected their trade. They also consigned their sheep flocks to the 'Umur and the Hadidiyin. To all these tribes, al-Sukhnah's residents supplied grain, cloth, clothing, and various household items and foodstuffs, while purchasing from them pastoral products for resale to Syria's large cities.Mundy and Musallam, 2000, pp. 126‚Äì129.

The Essendon Town recruit played initially at West Perth, where he was a member of their 1905 West Australian Football League premiership team, before spending some time at Boulder City in the Goldfields Football Association. Ford returned to Carlton towards the end of the 1908 season and played in that year's premiership side, the third in a row for the club.

During his time at Carlton he acted as club secretary but lost the job following a controversial incident in their Round 14, 1910 match against Fitzroy. Following the match, Ford was cited for abusing and physically threatening the field umpire which resulted in a 12 month suspension. A possible reason for Ford's abuse was that it was the same umpire who had suspended his teammate George Topping earlier in the season. He resumed his career once the suspension ended in 1911 and participated in his club's finals campaign that year.

He also reprised his role as Ethan in July 2015 for two episodes. In September 2020, Parsons briefly reprised his role for three episodes. Casting In 2008, General Hospital put out a casting call for an actor to play \\"Dante,\\" the son of characters Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) and Olivia Falconeri (Lisa Lo Cicero). Parsons auditioned for the role and was called back twice after the audition, but the show did not cast him as Dante. \\"They said they weren't going to give me the part I auditioned for, but they wanted me on the show, so they were going to write me in,\\" Parsons said. The writers created the character Ethan Lovett specifically for the actor. \\"It's cool, because it gives me a completely clean slate for this character,\\" he said. \\"Since it was written for me, I can play with it and make Ethan whoever I want him to be.\\" The character's debut story centered around the mystery of who his parents were. Headwriter Robert Guza Jr. hinted that Ethan would connect Luke Spencer's family to another family with whom they were once affiliated. The writers tied Ethan to established characters Luke Spencer (Geary), Holly Sutton (Samms), and Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers) -- made household names during General Hospital 1980s peak -- with the question of whether or not he is Holly's son with one of the two men. In November 2011, rumors began to surface that Parsons was considering exiting the series, which was effectively confirmed little over a month later following a tweet from co-star Julie Marie Berman. Parsons departed the series, following a three-year run, on March 7, 2012. On April 2, 2013, Parsons reprised the role for two episodes as part of the series' 50th anniversary.

He had met one of Luke's former flames, thief and con-artist Holly Sutton, in his travels. Holly had told Ethan she had taught him all she knew and he should seek out master con-artist Luke Spencer, in America. Ethan secretly carried a photo Holly had given him of Luke and his longtime friend Robert Scorpio, who had been married to Holly. It was Helena who would first say aloud Luke and Ethan had to be related due to the obvious similarity of the two men. Upon the revelation the Lovetts were actually his adoptive parents and he never knew his biological parents; Luke and his wife Tracy Quartermaine began to suspect Holly may be Ethan's mother and Luke could be his father.

Luke promises he won't ever leave Ethan without letting him know. Before he was kidnapped, Luke and Ethan sent in a paternity test which Tracy didn't know about. Ethan lets Luke know the DNA test confirms they are father and son. On June 5, 2009, Ethan was revealed to be conspiring and romantically involved with Rebecca Shaw, a newly arrived lookalike of the deceased Emily Quartermaine.General Hospital recap (6/5/09) - Soaps.com After discovering Rebecca's deception, Prince Nikolas Cassadine discloses to Ethan he has a plan to retaliate against Rebecca. She arrived in Port Charles planning to use her resemblance to Emily to endear herself to Nikolas and the Quartermaines. The paln was to then bilk them of money (a plot she concocted with Ethan). Nikolas says he is going to win her heart, then dump her. This outrages Ethan, who wants to be with Rebecca himself. As Nikolas said would happen, nobody believes Ethan when he tries to reveal what Nikolas is up to. On Nov. 16, 2009, Ethan appeals to Elizabeth Webber for help in talking Nikolas out of hurting Rebecca. Elizabeth, having a secret affair with Nikolas, tells him Rebecca deserves what she gets. Rebecca leaves Port Charles right before Christmas. She doesn't let Ethan know until she is at the airport. After the affair between Nikolas and Elizabeth is revealed, Lulu yells at Elizabeth in the hospital nurses station. Ethan is there and he learns Rebecca left because she learned of Nikolas's affair with Elizabeth. Ethan happens across Michael Corinthos III (his cousin) having an argument with Kristina Davis on the docks. He tells Michael to ease up. Michael leaves, but not before he tells Ethan off, saying he should be more careful about what strangers he talks so boldly to because he‚Äôll live longer. Kristina thanks Ethan, who asks what happened to her face and she says she tripped. Kristina, who appears to have a crush on Ethan, compliments his singing karaoke at the \\"nonwedding\\" party for Maxie Jones and Damian Spinelli. She also asks for his number in case she needs his help again. He programs it into her phone. On November 25, 2009, Ethan runs into Kristina at Kelly's as he is about to get a turkey burger. They flirt again, and talk about American and Australian Thanksgiving. She reminds him holidays are for family, which convinces him to spend it with his family. He walks her to Robin Scorpio's and then arrives at the Quartermaine mansion, where he celebrates with Luke, Lulu, Tracy, Monica, Edward, Alice and Rebecca. In keeping with the dysfunctional Quartermaine family's holiday tradition, they all share pizza. Ethan spends December 16, 2009 at Alexis Davis's house with Kristina, her sister Molly, family friend Diane, and Kristina's overly jealous boyfriend, Keifer Bauer. Kristina, and all of the females, enjoy having him there. Keifer leaves jealous and angry and she realizes he was her guest. Ethan spends Christmas Eve with Luke, Tracy, Lucky, Lulu, Dante, Elizabeth, Nikolas, Cameron, Jake and Spencer and he reads to the boys The Night Before Christmas as Lucky puts Laura Spencer's angel on top of the tree. Since New Year's, Ethan has protected Kristina from her boyfriend Keifer on numerous occasions. He also promised to teach her how to play poker. He took Mike Corbin to the hospital after finding him beaten in an alley, tried to comfort Elizabeth after Lulu verbally attacks her at the hospital, went to baby cousin Josslyn Jacks's christening with his family and enjoyed the ceremony, and comforted his sister Lulu after her boyfriend Dante Falconeri is shot. =2010‚Äì2011= In February 2010, Ethan finds Elizabeth at the Haunted Star and realizes how hurt and angry she is. He tries to help. He then goes to Wyndemere, asked over by Nikolas. After bantering back and forth, learns Elizabeth was raped when she was 15. Trying to put her life back together is what began her love with Lucky. Later he shows up at Kelly's in time to yell at Kiefer, waits as Kristina stands up for herself. He leaves after being invited for coffee with Kristina on his arm. Johnny Zacchara, who has been trying to take down Sonny Corinthos' organization from the inside, prompts Ethan with an offer to be his sidekick in exchange for a 50/50 split of the profits. Ethan has yet to make a firm decision, but is obviously swayed by the offer. This is much to the disapproval of Luke, Tracy and Lucky. They think if Ethan gets caught up in this, he will end up getting hurt or possibly killed. Luke has repeatedly tried to change his mind. Lucky, in an attempt to keep Ethan safe, threatens to arrest him for an expired visa and have him deported back to Australia. Luke stops Lucky from doing this. He and Ethan come up with a plan to get Ethan a green card. Luke involves Tracy in their plan. They decide Ethan needs to get his green card quick. The best way to do that is to get him married. On March 8, 2010, in a twist of events Tracy offers to become Ethan's wife. Ethan and Luke aren't game. When Tracy sees how upset Luke gets about them getting divorced and her marrying his son, she becomes amused. Ethan then becomes amused as well. He agrees with Tracy they should get married. In March 2010, Ethan started dating Bernie Abrahms secretary Jennifer Biles (starting out by helping Johnny), causing Kristina to get jealous. On March 11, 2010 Kristina blows off a date with Kiefer and has Molly hack into Ethan and Jennifer's e-mails to cancel their date. She shows up at the Haunted Star all dressed up trying to get Ethan's attention, He forcefully gets through to her by grabbing and bruising her arm, to leave him alone. He later shows up at the Lake House to apologize. He finds Kristina beaten and bloody on the floor, and rushes her to General Hospital. Lucky and Sonny question her at the hospital about who is responsible. She lies and says it was Ethan. Ethan is arrested on March 16, 2010, but is bailed out by his step-mother Tracy Quartermaine. Sam attacked Ethan on March 18, 2010 but he does not fight back, as he won't hit a woman. On March 22, 2010 he visits Kristina to find out why she pointed out him, only to be caught by Sam. He is arrested again by Lucky. He is then given support by his father Luke. The charges are dropped on March 26. Ethan is released, but nonetheless shunned by most of Port Charles for his alleged attack on Kristina. He is only stopped from leaving town by Luke's insistence he wait for Lucky and Dante to look into Kristina's accusations. On April 2, Lucky and Dante realize Kristina is lying to protect Keifer from Sonny‚Äôs wrath. (She had also figured naming Ethan would not get him killed since his father, Luke, is Sonny's old and dear friend.) On April 6, 2010, Ethan is notified by Lucky he is clear of assault charges. However, he is now a suspect in the hit and run of Kiefer Bauer and thrown in jail. On April 11, 2010, the charges against Ethan are dropped when Alexis Davis confesses to running down Keifer Bauer, giving Ethan an opportunity for a fresh start. Nonetheless, Ethan is understandably frustrated people keep accusing him of things. Ethan forgives Kristina after she apologizes profusely for the events of the recent past. They agree to be friends. Ethan has been working for Johnny, trying to help in his mob dealings. He is more interested in the money than the danger and possible death. He and Johnny have become friends and confidants, as well as business associates. Meanwhile, Kristina has confided in Ethan about her abuse counseling, her therapy sessions, and her life as Sonny's daughter. Whenever they talk, he always listens and provides her with insight and support. Despite the events of the past and the obvious differences between them, Ethan and Kristina do become friends. While trying to assert her independence from her domineering mobster father Sonny, Kristina convinced Johnny they should pretend to date, which he knows isn't a good idea; but does drive her father (and mother) nuts. On June 16, 2010, it proved to make Ethan a bit jealous, although he tried to hide it, and he has tried convincing Kristina it is not a good idea. After a bomb was planted in Johnny's car by Sonny, which could have killed Kristina, it is Ethan who convinces Johnny to lie to the police about who planted the bomb. Ethan reasons Johnny owes it to Kristina not to name her father since Johnny shouldn't have been pretending to date her. Ethan stands at the nurse's hub with Maya Ward when Kristina Davis runs into the lobby yelling. Ethan, Lucky and Maya all run after her, and stop her brother Michael from choking Warren Bauer. He demands Lucky arrest Michael, who is on parole. All present state Michael had merely helped him up, which makes Bauer even angrier. Ethan returns to the hub with Maya, and is soon after shot by Mr. Bauer, along with Mac Scorpio, after Bauer walked into the hospital lobby and open fired. Bauer then attempts to shoot Kristina, whom he blames for his son Keifer's death. Michael protects Kristina by standing between her and Bauer. Mac Scorpio manages to fire off a shot at Bauer. Ethan has been shot in the neck and Steven needs Maya's help to save him, but she freezes and is unable to help at all. Ethan is saved by Steven and Olivia Falconeri. He woke up soon after, with Maya by his side, who blamed herself for him almost dying. Kristina came to visit him, along with Carly and Michael. She feels everything is her fault. He reassures her he does not blame her. She he tells him she's glad he didn't die. She intends to keep him in her life for a very long time. As Kristina stands outside Johnny's hospital room (after he was shot by Sonny), Ethan finds her and reminds her it is not her fault and everyone has their good and bad parts of life. Although he reminds her he is, after all, a con and a thief; she says he's genuinely good, and he is her hero. Later, he sees Kristina outside of Kelly's and they chat while he waits for Maya. In February 2011, Ethan is called to Kelly's by his father Luke Spencer as he is going to Sonny's wedding but has no one to help at the diner. Ethan tries to get out of it, but starts helping. Kristina shows up with Molly, dressed as a bridesmaids and talks with Ethan, and invites him to the wedding. He quickly tells his father he can't help, and leaves to change. He arrives with Luke and Lulu, and compliments Kristina. When Kristina gets to the altar she looks around and smiles at Ethan, which he returns with a grin. His father, Luke, notes this and is not amused. He has continued to remind Ethan, just last year, this is the \\"same little girl that accused him of beating the hell out of her\\". At the reception, Ethan tells Kristina he doesn't remember much about his own wedding to Maya in Las Vegas since they were drunk and married by accident. He later offers her his hand to dance with him. This did not go unnoticed by her father, nor his. While dancing at the reception, Kristina informs Ethan she plans to marry him one day. Ethan thinks this is hilarious and she is just joking. After the wedding, Sam is caught in a car bomb, which was a decoy for the Balkan to capture Brenda. Ethan shielded Kristina, Molly and Morgan from the bomb blast and made the decision to take the children back to Alexis' lake house. He stays with Kristina and Molly at Alexis' house while she deals with Sam, and does his best to comfort the two. While there, it became evident to him Kristina was interested in him romantically once again and he tries to dissuade her. She falls asleep with her head on Ethan's shoulder. At the Quatermaine's, Ethan follows Maya out to the boat-house after she prevents Edward from calling the police on him for theft. He learns she is helping her little cousin, Michael Corinthos, hiding out from the cops. He tells her if she's looking for a 'Bad Boy', he's 'right here. It would be a shame to waste' him. Maya is sent to Luke's by Edward to tell him he and Ethan are not welcome at the Quatermaine mansion in Tracy's absence. While in Luke's office, Ethan attempts to rope Maya into one of his cover stories. She calls him out on it. Luke laughs and tells Ethan he's met his match. Later that day, Ethan and Johnny go to Jake's to celebrate a move on Sonny. Ethan accidentally spills Maya's drink on her. After Brooklyn Aston's karaoke solo, Ethan tells Maya he's kinda in the Mob. She gets upset, then leaves. While in Luke's office, Johnny Zacchara stops by for Ethan. He also reveals Ethan likes Maya. She assures him the feeling isn't mutual. Over a flirty card game, Ethan asks Maya why she's so hostile to him. She has to admit he's a pretty decent guy. He then spends the next couple of months coming up with excuses to run into her. At Jake's one night, he asks her again why she's so determined to hate him. Maya informs him he reminds her of an ex. Ethan then asks if her ex was mean to her. She said he was wonderful to her, but he took too many risks. She was just starting out as a doctor. While doing her usual rotation in the ER, he was admitted with a GSW (gunshot wound). Maya froze when she saw him. Her boyfriend had already lost too much blood to be saved. According to Maya, he never regained consciousness, and died in the hospital. On the July 22 episode. Ethan was shot. Maya was unable to assist him. She had frozen with memories of her ex-boyfriend. She stays by his side. He helps her through her 'crisis of confidence' about being a doctor. Tracy takes Ethan back to the mansion to recuperate. Maya avoids him. Ethan eventually corners Maya at Kelly's and asks for some insight into her mind. She admits she can't stop thinking about him. She's conflicted then runs off. Ethan goes to General Hospital later that day. After months of flirting with one another, Maya and Ethan share their first kiss. The two start dating. Ethan asks Maya for help in getting Tracy and Luke back together. Luke had revealed their marriage is a fraud. Luke fakes a heart attack. Maya fakes his test results. Tracy seems to be falling for their plan but it backfires, when she secretly discovers what's going on. As part of the scam, Ethan reveals the truth to Tracy. Everything is out in the open. Luke then convinces Tracy to go to Vegas with him, with Maya and Ethan as chaperones. Tracy agrees, makes no promises of marriage. She blackmails Maya into coming by threatening to tell about her falsifying medical records. In November 2010, the four wake up with hangovers in a Las Vegas hotel room. Tracy and Luke had gotten too drunk to control. Luke reveals a marriage certificate thinking it's his and Tracy's. It actually belongs to Maya and Ethan, the couple who got married instead. Luke and Tracy search for a mobile attorney to get the marriage annulled. Maya and Ethan hang out at casino. Maya wins big in Black Jack. They retreat to the hotel room and have sex for the first time. The attorney Tracy finds tells them they can still get an annulment even though they had sex repeatedly. The fact they were very drunk when they married one another is grounds enough. They choose to wait on the annulment, and enjoy the perks of marriage for a little while longer. Upon their return to Port Charles, Ethan texts Lulu about his nuptials and asks her to 'break the news to Edward since he has a soft spot for her. At the mansion, he carries Maya over the threshold and says it's a tradition. They smooch. Luke complains that should be him and Tracy. Lulu storms in saying there's no way Ethan and Maya got married. Edward reflects on his affair with Mary Mae. He states they couldn't last for all sorts of reasons, Maya and Ethan don't have any of those obstacles. He gets Ethan and Maya admit they feel something for each other. Edward offers them $1 million tax-free, to stay married for one full year. Maya rejects Edward's million dollar offer. Lulu encourages her brother to do the same. However, Ethan agrees. Maya wants to know what the catch is. Edward says there is none. They can stay together or break up after a year - no strings attached. Edward reminds her they could have annulled their marriage in Vegas, but didn't. Maya eventually agrees when Ethan points out she can use the money to pay off her student loans and help her sister. =2011‚Äì2012, 2013, 2020= In June 2011, Ethan visits Maya in Philadelphia, PA and discovered her in bed with another man. She later told Ethan she had been lying to him for a while. She had no plans to return to Port Charles. Afterwards, Ethan and Maya decided the marriage was over and parted amicably. On June 9, Ethan flew down to the Dominican Republic to obtain a divorce. As Kristina's romantic feelings on Ethan re-emerged, she began to openly pursue him. Ethan's mixed signals towards Kristina for several months only compounded the problem, especially when he made his marriage to Maya seem like it was simply a business arrangement. This became an issue when Kristina boarded a plane to accompany Ethan to the Dominican Republic on June 9 so he could obtain a quickie divorce from Maya, which led to her father contemplating Ethan's murder when he discovered their trip to the Dominican Republic (with Alexis and Sonny assuming they were going to get married). After a few days of fun in the sun and a humorous mix-up in the divorce officiator's office, her parents escorted the two back to Port Charles. Sonny, in particular, seems especially against Ethan having any sort of relationship with his daughter and has threatened Ethan's life numerous times in order to reinforce that belief. Ethan, however, has been adamant about continuing his association with Kristina, with or without Sonny's approval. In a discussion about Ethan and Kristina's relationship, Alexis pointed out to Sonny he had no problem with his son living with a woman ten years his senior, which led to Sonny's retort Michael's situation with Abby was different because Michael was \\"a boy.\\" Their trip to the Dominican Republic only stoked the flames of Kristina's desire to be with Ethan. On June 24, under the guise of planning a trip abroad for a college class, Kristina invites Ethan to the Lake House, where she created a romantic setting and flirted with him and, ultimately, kissing him upon Ethan's invitation to see if she still has feelings for him once they have kissed. After the kiss, Kristina informs Ethan she still has romantic feelings for him, but their conversation is interrupted by Alexis and Molly coming home. Months later, Kristina was accosted by Anthony Zacchara, who threatened her as a means to get to Sonny. Ethan intervened, much to her relief, and turned Anthony away, causing Kristina to become grateful to Ethan. Ethan went to see Michael about Kristina's feelings towards him, but Michael pointed out Ethan did little to dissuade her romantic feelings for him for several months. Afterwards, Ethan, Michael, and Abby formulated a plan that involved Ethan feigning interest in Abby in order to get Kristina to move on from Ethan. Kristina was not fooled by the deception, however. After several months of sending Kristina mixed signals about their relationship, Ethan finally told Kristina on July 7 about her skewed perceptions about the two of them together. Kristina, while taken aback, is nonetheless determined to prove Ethan does, in fact, care about her. In an attempt to protect Ethan, Kristina goes to see Johnny Zacchara, Ethan's employer and friend, with the request he fire Ethan in an attempt to get him out of harm's way. Throughout all of this, Ethan himself has shown on numerous occasions he could also be developing feelings for her, albeit conflicted, through the actions which he has taken in Kristina's honor, i.e. protecting her with an intensity that eventually caused Johnny to urge him to admit he likes her. Johnny, in particular, calls Ethan out on having feelings for Kristina, and fires him. The following year, Helena would reveal to a captive Luke and Ethan that \\"Cassandra\\" was actually Irina Cassadine, her secret daughter she had kept captive on her island in Greece. Helena then ordered Irina to shoot Ethan because he is Luke's son and it was Luke who killed her beloved son, Stavros. Irina would instead turn the gun on her mother, Helena. She would fire the gun, but the gun was empty. Irina, having failed her mother's test of loyalty, would pay with her life. Helena, very cold-heartedly, told her henchmen to \\"kill her.\\" Irina would die on the floor of the Library at Wyndmere with a heartbroken Ethan holding her. Then Helena ordered Ethan be shot with Luke watching his son die. Ethan's mother, Holly, surprisingly appears and reveals to Helena, Luke, and Ethan that Ethan is not even Luke's son and therefore should be spared. Holly says Ethan is actually Robert Scorpio's son and claims the DNA tests proving him to be Luke's son were doctored. Helena then decides to postpone Ethan's execution until she verifies whether or not Holly is telling the truth. Once Helena leaves, Holly confesses to Luke and Ethan she fabricated the fake paternity story to save Ethan's life and he is, without any doubt, Luke's son. Later, Luke finds Robert on the ledge of a bridge about to jump into a canyon and commit suicide. Robert is distraught over the tragic accidental death of his only child, Robin. In an effort to save his best friend and give him a purpose to continue living, Luke lies to Robert by telling him Ethan is Robert's son, not his. Luke also tells him Helena has taken Ethan captive and he needs to be rescued immediately. Shortly after, at Luke's request, Ethan decides to leave town and \\"disappear for a while\\" to keep the lie believable for Robert's sake. Luke would point out to Holly if Ethan leaves town it would also keep him out of Helena's grasp when she discovers he really is Luke's son. Reluctantly, they agree Ethan leaving would be the best solution for all concerned. On March 7, Ethan says goodbye to his parents, Luke and Holly, in the library at Wyndemere and leaves via the library's secret passageway that leads to the tunnels of Spoon Island. Then Robert and Holly quickly leave town in pursuit of \\"their\\" son, Ethan, and his supposed captor, Helena Cassadine. Helena causes Ethan to be found by Luke and Laura on the Haunted Star in the Atlantic Ocean as a distraction for the couple during the search for their daughter Lulu. Ethan is captured by Helena while staying at Lucky's place in Dublin while he is working in Africa. Ethan shows up in Monte Carlo surprising Olivia Quartermaine (Lisa LoCicero) and Robert Scorpio (Tristan Rogers). After talking with Olivia, he punches Robert in the face to get the attention of management so that they could go into the back where they think Holly Sutton- Scorpio (Emma Samms) may be being held captive. As they are tied up, they free themselves only for Winston Rudge (David S. Lee) to walk in on them with a gun revealing that he knows Robert. Reception The character of \\"charismatic drifter/grifter\\" Ethan was initially a recurring role, but Parsons was soon put on contract with the series. In March 2009 Soaps In Depth magazine credited Parsons with \\"taking the show by storm\\" and dubbed Ethan \\"one of daytime's most riveting young characters.\\" Controversy surrounded the actor and the character when it was revealed Ethan was a product of an affair between Luke Spencer and Holly Sutton. \\"I was tremendously disliked for that! [Laughs] I was a dagger in the heart of all the Luke and Laura fans! They didn't want to believe Luke done such a thing during his legendary romance with Laura. And I don't blame them. It wasn't my fault, but I took a lot of heat.\\" ReferencesExternal links *Ethan Lovett profile - ABC.com *Ethan Lovett profile - Soaps.com Category:General Hospital characters Category:Fictional adoptees Category:Fictional bartenders Category:Fictional con artists Category:Fictional mobsters Category:Fictional Australian people Category:Television characters introduced in 1987 ","title":"Ethan Lovett"},{"id":"21784015","text":"Walter Caprile (born July 25, 1973 in Canelones) is a former Uruguayan footballer.

The minimal-energy state in the conduction band and the maximal-energy state in the valence band are each characterized by a certain crystal momentum (k-vector) in the Brillouin zone. If the k-vectors are different, the material has an \\"indirect gap\\". The band gap is called \\"direct\\" if the crystal momentum of electrons and holes is the same in both the conduction band and the valence band; an electron can directly emit a photon. In an \\"indirect\\" gap, a photon cannot be emitted because the electron must pass through an intermediate state and transfer momentum to the crystal lattice. Examples of direct bandgap materials include amorphous silicon and some III-V materials such as InAs, GaAs. Indirect bandgap materials include crystalline silicon and Ge. Some III-V materials are indirect bandgap as well, for example AlSb. Energy vs. crystal momentum for a semiconductor with an indirect band gap, showing that an electron cannot shift from the highest-energy state in the valence band (red) to the lowest-energy state in the conduction band (green) without a change in momentum. Here, almost all of the energy comes from a photon (vertical arrow), while almost all of the momentum comes from a phonon (horizontal arrow). Energy vs. crystal momentum for a semiconductor with a direct band gap, showing that an electron can shift from the highest-energy state in the valence band (red) to the lowest-energy state in the conduction band (green) without a change in crystal momentum. Depicted is a transition in which a photon excites an electron from the valence band to the conduction band. Bulk band structure for Si, Ge, GaAs and InAs generated with tight binding model. Note that Si and Ge are indirect band gap with minima at X and L, while GaAs and InAs are direct band gap materials. Implications for radiative recombination Interactions among electrons, holes, phonons, photons, and other particles are required to satisfy conservation of energy and crystal momentum (i.e., conservation of total k-vector). A photon with an energy near a semiconductor band gap has almost zero momentum. One important process is called radiative recombination, where an electron in the conduction band annihilates a hole in the valence band, releasing the excess energy as a photon. This is possible in a direct band gap semiconductor if the electron has a k-vector near the conduction band minimum (the hole will share the same k-vector), but not possible in an indirect band gap semiconductor, as photons cannot carry crystal momentum, and thus conservation of crystal momentum would be violated. For radiative recombination to occur in an indirect band gap material, the process must also involve the absorption or emission of a phonon, where the phonon momentum equals the difference between the electron and hole momentum. It can also, instead, involve a crystallographic defect, which performs essentially the same role. The involvement of the phonon makes this process much less likely to occur in a given span of time, which is why radiative recombination is far slower in indirect band gap materials than direct band gap ones. This is why light-emitting and laser diodes are almost always made of direct band gap materials, and not indirect band gap ones like silicon. The fact that radiative recombination is slow in indirect band gap materials also means that, under most circumstances, radiative recombinations will be a small proportion of total recombinations, with most recombinations being non- radiative, taking place at point defects or at grain boundaries. However, if the excited electrons are prevented from reaching these recombination places, they have no choice but to eventually fall back into the valence band by radiative recombination. This can be done by creating a dislocation loop in the material. At the edge of the loop, the planes above and beneath the \\"dislocation disk\\" are pulled apart, creating a negative pressure, which raises the energy of the conduction band substantially, with the result that the electrons cannot pass this edge. Provided that the area directly above the dislocation loop is defect-free (no non-radiative recombination possible), the electrons will fall back into the valence shell by radiative recombination, thus emitting light. This is the principle on which \\"DELEDs\\" (Dislocation Engineered LEDs) are based. Implications for light absorption The exact reverse of radiative recombination is light absorption. For the same reason as above, light with a photon energy close to the band gap can penetrate much farther before being absorbed in an indirect band gap material than a direct band gap one (at least insofar as the light absorption is due to exciting electrons across the band gap). This fact is very important for photovoltaics (solar cells). Crystalline silicon is the most common solar-cell substrate material, despite the fact that it is indirect-gap and therefore does not absorb light very well. As such, they are typically hundreds of microns thick; thinner wafers would allow much of the light (particularly in longer wavelengths) to simply pass through. By comparison, thin-film solar cells are made of direct band gap materials (such as amorphous silicon, CdTe, CIGS or CZTS), which absorb the light in a much thinner region, and consequently can be made with a very thin active layer (often less than 1 micron thick). The absorption spectrum of an indirect band gap material usually depends more on temperature than that of a direct material, because at low temperatures there are fewer phonons, and therefore it is less likely that a photon and phonon can be simultaneously absorbed to create an indirect transition. For example, silicon is opaque to visible light at room temperature, but transparent to red light at liquid helium temperatures, because red photons can only be absorbed in an indirect transition. =Formula for absorption= A common and simple method for determining whether a band gap is direct or indirect uses absorption spectroscopy. By plotting certain powers of the absorption coefficient against photon energy, one can normally tell both what value the band gap is, and whether or not it is direct. For a direct band gap, the absorption coefficient \\\\alpha is related to light frequency according to the following formula:Optoelectronics, by E. Rosencher, 2002, equation (7.25).Pankove has the same equation, but with an apparently different prefactor A^*. However, in the Pankove version, the units / dimensional analysis appears not to work out. :\\\\alpha \\\\approx A^*\\\\sqrt{h u - E_{\\\\text{g}}}, with A^*=\\\\frac{q^2 x_{vc}^2 (2m_{\\\\text{r}})^{3/2}}{\\\\lambda_0 \\\\epsilon_0 \\\\hbar^3 n} where: * \\\\alpha is the absorption coefficient, a function of light frequency * u is light frequency *h is Planck's constant (h u is the energy of a photon with frequency u) *\\\\hbar is reduced Planck's constant (\\\\hbar=h/2\\\\pi) *E_{\\\\text{g}} is the band gap energy *A^* is a certain frequency-independent constant, with formula above *m_{\\\\text{r}}=\\\\frac{m_{\\\\text{h}}^* m_{\\\\text{e}}^*}{m_{\\\\text{h}}^* + m_{\\\\text{e}}^*}, where m_{\\\\text{e}}^* and m_{\\\\text{h}}^* are the effective masses of the electron and hole, respectively (m_{\\\\text{r}} is called a \\"reduced mass\\") *q is the elementary charge *n is the (real) index of refraction *\\\\epsilon_0 is the vacuum permittivity *x_{vc} is a \\"matrix element\\", with units of length and typical value the same order of magnitude as the lattice constant. This formula is valid only for light with photon energy larger, but not too much larger, than the band gap (more specifically, this formula assumes the bands are approximately parabolic), and ignores all other sources of absorption other than the band-to-band absorption in question, as well as the electrical attraction between the newly created electron and hole (see exciton). It is also invalid in the case that the direct transition is forbidden, or in the case that many of the valence band states are empty or conduction band states are full.J.I. Pankove, Optical Processes in Semiconductors. Dover, 1971. On the other hand, for an indirect band gap, the formula is: :\\\\alpha \\\\propto \\\\frac{(h u- E_{\\\\text{g}}+E_{\\\\text{p}})^2}{\\\\exp(\\\\frac{E_{\\\\text{p}}}{kT})-1} + \\\\frac{(h u- E_{\\\\text{g}}-E_{\\\\text{p}})^2}{1-\\\\exp(-\\\\frac{E_{\\\\text{p}}}{kT})} where: *E_{\\\\text{p}} is the energy of the phonon that assists in the transition *k is Boltzmann's constant *T is the thermodynamic temperature This formula involves the same approximations mentioned above. Therefore, if a plot of h u versus \\\\alpha^2 forms a straight line, it can normally be inferred that there is a direct band gap, measurable by extrapolating the straight line to the \\\\alpha=0 axis. On the other hand, if a plot of h u versus \\\\alpha^{1/2} forms a straight line, it can normally be inferred that there is an indirect band gap, measurable by extrapolating the straight line to the \\\\alpha=0 axis (assuming E_{\\\\text{p}}\\\\approx 0). Other aspects In some materials with an indirect gap, the value of the gap is negative. The top of the valence band is higher than the bottom of the conduction band in energy. Such materials are known as semimetals. See also * Moss‚ÄìBurstein effect * Tauc plot ReferencesExternal links * B.

The larval mites feed on the skin cells of animals. The six-legged parasitic larvae feed on a large variety of creatures, including humans, rabbits, toads, box turtles, quail, and even some insects. After crawling onto their hosts, they inject digestive enzymes into the skin that break down skin cells. They do not actually \\"bite\\", but instead form a hole in the skin called a stylostome and chew up tiny parts of the inner skin, thus causing severe irritation and swelling. The severe itching is accompanied by red, pimple-like bumps (papules) or hives and skin rash or lesions on a sun-exposed area. For humans, itching usually occurs after the larvae detach from the skin. After feeding on their hosts, the larvae drop to the ground and become nymphs, then mature into adults, which have eight legs and are harmless to humans. In the postlarval stage, they are not parasitic and feed on plant material. The females lay three to eight eggs in a clutch, usually on a leaf or under the roots of a plant, and die by autumn. History Trombiculidae, from Greek (\\"to tremble\\") and Latin ', genitive ' (\\"gnat\\" or \\"midge\\"), was first described as an independent family by Henry Ellsworth Ewing in 1944. Then, when the family was first described, it included two subfamilies, Hemitrombiculinae and Trombiculinae. Womersley added another, Leeuwenhoekiinae, which at the time contained only Leeuwenhoekia. Later, he erected the family Leeuwenhoekiidae for the genus and subfamily, having six genera; they have a pair of submedian setae present on the dorsal plate. References to chiggers, however, go as far back as sixth- century China, and by 1733, the first recognition of trombiculid mites in North America was made. In 1758, Carl Linnaeus described a single species, Acarus batatas (now Trombicula batatas). However, most information about chiggers came from problems that arose during and after World War II.  Distribution  Trombiculid mites are found throughout the world. In Europe and North America, they tend to be more prevalent in the hot and humid regions. In the more temperate regions, they are found only during the summer (in French, harvest mites are called ao√ªtat because they are common in August). In the United States, they are found mostly in the Southeast, the South, and the Midwest. They are not present, or barely found, in far northern areas, high mountains, and deserts. In the British Isles, the species Trombicula autumnalis is called harvest mites, in North America the species Trombicula alfreddugesi, and the species Trombicula (eutrombicula) hirsti, which are found in Australia and are commonly called the scrub-itch mite. Life cycle The lifecycle of a harvest mite The length of the mite's cycle depends on species and environment, but normally lasts two to 12 months. The number of cycles in a year depends on the region. For example, in a temperate region, only three per year may occur, but in tropical regions, the cycle might be continuous all year long. Adult harvest mites winter in protected places such as slightly below the soil surface. Females become active in the spring, and once the ground temperature is regularly above , they lay eggs in vegetation, up to 15 eggs per day. The eggs are round and are dormant for about six days, after which the nonfeeding prelarvae emerge, with only three pairs of legs. After about six days, the prelarvae grow into their larval stage. =Larva= The larvae, commonly called chiggers, are about in diameter, normally light red in color, and covered in hairs; they move quickly relative to size. The larvae congregate in groups on small clods of soil, in matted vegetation, and even on low bushes and plants, where they have more access to prospective hosts. The larval stage is the only parasitic stage of the mite's lifecycle. They are parasites on many animals. About 30 of the many species in this family, in their larval stage, attach to various animals and feed on skin. This often causes intensely itchy, red bumps in humans. right Chiggers attach to the host, pierce the skin, inject enzymes into the bite wound that digest cellular contents, and then suck up the digested tissue through a tube formed by hardened skin cells called a stylostome. They do not burrow into the skin or suck blood, as is commonly assumed. Itching from a chigger bite may not develop until 24‚Äì48 hours after the bite, so the victim may not associate the specific exposure with the bite itself. The red welt/bump on the skin is not where a chigger laid eggs, as is sometimes believed.About.com: Chiggers Pediatric Dermatology Basics The larvae remain attached to suitable hosts for three to five days before dropping off to begin their nymphal stage. They tend to attach where clothing has restrictions, such as belt lines, or behind the knees when wearing jeans. During the wet season, chiggers are usually found in tall grass and other vegetation. During dry seasons, chiggers are mostly found underneath brush and shady areas.University of Florida: IFAS Extension Standing still or lying in tall grass gives them more time to climb onto a person. =Nymph= Once the larva has engorged itself on skin and has fallen off its host, it develops to its nymph stage. The nymph is sexually immature, but more closely resembles the adult. This stage consists of three phases, the protonymph, deutonymph, and tritonymph. The protonymph and tritonymph morphologies are unusual in species of Trombiculidae. The protonymph phase combines larval and protonymph characteristics with deutonymph and tritonymph morphology. The protonymph is an inactive transitional stage. The active deutonymph develops an additional pair of legs (for a total of eight). Lastly, it re-enters inactivity during its transitional tritonymph phase before growing to adulthood. =Adult= As deutonymphs and adults, trombiculid mites are independent predators that feed on small arthropods and their eggs, and are also found to eat plant material. They live in soil, and are often found when digging in yards or gardens or in compost bins. Recently (2018), methods based on autofluorescence microscopy were developed to enable identification of trombiculid mites to the species level on the basis of morphological traits without any special preparation.  Effect on humans  Trombiculosis = Trombiculosis, also called trombiculiasis and trombiculidiasis, is the term coined for the rash or infestation caused by trombiculid mite larvae.An \\"infestation\\" with Trombicula mites (chiggers). http://medical- dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/trombiculiasis = Handling chigger bite = Chigger-caused lesions on human skin showing characteristic welts A Trombiculid mite larva attached to human skin Because chigger wounds are a complex combination of enzymatic and the resulting mechanical damage, plus allergy and immune responses, plus possible secondary bacterial infection subject to local influences, no one remedy works equally well for most people. The chiggers' digestive enzymes in the saliva cause \\"the insanely itchy welts\\".Missouri Department of Conservation The itching can be alleviated through use of over-the-counter topical corticosteroids and antihistamines. According to Mayo Clinic, the chiggers \\"fall off after a few days, leaving behind red, itchy welts\\", which normally heal on their own within one to two weeks.Mayo Clinic, Healthy Lifestyle, Slide show: Poison ivy and other summer skin irritants - Chiggers \\"fall off after a few days, leaving behind red, itchy welts.\\" Hot showers or baths also help reduce itching. In cases of severe dermatitis or secondary infection associated with chigger bites, a doctor should be consulted.2006, Field Guide to Venomous and Medically Important Invertebrates Affecting Military Operations: Identification, Biology, Symptoms, Treatment According to an Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet:William F. Lyon, Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet, Entomology, Chiggers], HYG-2100-98 - Ohioline, --gives other \\"Control Measures\\" for chiggers, including: \\"Keep moving since the worst chigger infestations occur when sitting or laying down in a sunny spot at midday with temperatures above 60¬∞F.\\" > ...

(The sooner the treatment, the better the results.) Home remedies to \\"suffocate\\" the mite, such as applying clear nail polish, rubbing alcohol, or bleach, may have little benefit since the mites do not burrow into the skin. However, since the mite may still be attached for up to 3 days, these treatments could possibly kill the mite, reducing further damage. = Chiggers as disease vectors = Although the harvest mite chigger usually does not carry diseases in North American temperate climates, Leptotrombidium deliense is considered a dangerous pest in East Asia and the South Pacific because it often carries Orientia tsutsugamushi, the tiny bacterium that causes scrub typhus, which is known alternatively as the Japanese river disease, scrub disease, or tsutsugamushi. The mites are infected by the Rickettsia passed down from parent to offspring before eggs are laid in a process called transovarial transmission. Symptoms of scrub typhus in humans include fever, headache, muscle pain, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

Background  Gao Chongwen was born in 746, during the reign of Emperor Xuanzong. His ancestors were originally from Bohai Commandery (Ê∏§Êµ∑ÈÉ°, in modern Cangzhou, Hebei), but after relocating to Tang Dynasty's You Prefecture (ÂπΩÂ∑û, in modern Beijing), did not move for seven generations.New Book of Tang, vol. 170. He himself was born at You Prefecture, and was said to be simple, tolerant, and quiet. In his youth, he served in the army of Pinglu Circuit (Âπ≥Áõß, originally headquartered in modern Chaoyang, Liaoning but later moved to Weifang, Shandong).Old Book of Tang, vol. 151.  During Emperor Dezong's reign  During the Zhenyuan era (785-805) of Emperor Xuanzong's great-grandson Emperor Dezong, Gao Chongwen served under the general Han Quanyi () in defending Changwu Castle (Èï∑Ê≠¶Âüé, in modern Pingliang, Gansu) against Tufan. In summer 789, when a Tufan army, 30,000 in strength, attacked Ning Prefecture (ÂØßÂ∑û, in modern Qingyang, Gansu), Gao led 3,000 men in an effort to relieve Ning Prefecture, and he battled Tufan forces at Futang Plains (‰ΩõÂ†ÇÂéü, probably near Ning Prefecture), defeating them and killing more than half of the Tufan army. For this accomplishment, Gao was created the Prince of Bohai. Later, on an occasion when Han went to Chang'an to pay homage to Emperor Dezong, Gao served as acting military governor. In 798, he was promoted to be the commander of Changwu Castle. It was said that he gathered food and exercised the soldiers, leading to greater fighting capabilities for his men.  During Emperor Xianzong's reign  Campaign against Liu Pi = In spring 806, Liu Pi, who had already been in control of Xichuan Circuit (Ë•øÂ∑ù, headquartered in modern Chengdu, Sichuan), demanded that then-ruling Emperor Xianzong (Emperor Dezong's grandson) give him control over two neighboring circuits ‚Äî Dongchuan (Êù±Â∑ù, headquartered in modern Mianyang, Sichuan) and Shannan West (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi) as well. When Emperor Xianzong refused, Liu rose against imperial authority and attacked Dongchuan, intending to seize it. Many imperial officials were apprehensive about attacking Liu because Xichuan was well-fortified geographically, but the chancellor Du Huangchang advocated a campaign against Liu and recommended Gao Chongwen, stating that he knew that Gao was brave and intelligent. Emperor Xianzong agreed and commissioned Gao as the Jiedushi (usually the military governor of a circuit, but in this case an army commander) of the Left Shence Army (), commanding the forward troops against Liu, assisted by Li Yuanyi () and Yan Li (). It was said that at the time, many senior generals were expecting themselves to be put in charge in the operation against Liu, and that when Gao was announced as the commander, many were surprised. It was also said that he was apprehensive of another general, Liu Yong (), the military governor of Baoyi Circuit (‰øùÁæ©, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), and that Du motivated Gao on the campaign by warning him that if he were not successful, Liu Yong would be commissioned to replace him.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 237. It was said that as soon as Gao received the commission, both he and Li immediately headed toward Zi Prefecture (), the capital prefecture of Dongchuan, which Liu Pi had put under siege. While passing through Xingyuan Municipality (), the capital of Shannan West, there was a soldier who got angry at a restaurant and destroyed the chopsticks he was using; Gao immediately put him to death to maintain discipline. By the time that Gao reached Zi Prefecture, it had fallen, and Liu had taken the military governor of Dongchuan, Li Kang (), captive. With Gao arriving at Zi, Liu's officer Xing Ci (), who had occupied Zi, withdrew. Liu sent Li Kang to Gao and asked for Gao to intercede for him for Emperor Xianzong's forgiveness; however, Gao executed Li Kang, citing Li Kang's failure in battling Liu. At the recommendation of Wei Dan (), whom Emperor Xianzong had named as the new military governor of Dongchuan, Emperor Xianzong made Gao the deputy military governor of Dongchuan and acting military governor, so that his army can be better supplied directly. Meanwhile, Liu constructed eight defensive fences at Lutou Pass (ÈπøÈ†≠Èóú, in modern Deyang, Sichuan) to resist Gao. By summer 806, however, Gao was defeating him in eight straight battles and approaching Lutou Pass. Yan was also defeating Liu's other troops. As Gao was attacking Lutou Pass, the general Adie Guangyan circled around the pass and cut off its supply route, and Lutou Pass fell after Liu's officers Li Wenyue () and Qiu Liangfu () surrendered. Gao captured Liu's son-in-law Su Jiang () and headed straight for Xichuan's capital Chengdu. On November 5,http://www.sinica.edu.tw/ftms- bin/kiwi1/luso.sh?lstype=2&dyna;=%AD%F0&king;=%BE%CB%A9v&reign;=%A4%B8%A9M&yy;=1&ycanzi;=&mm;=9‚ÖÜ=&dcanzi;=%A8%AF%A5%E8 Chengdu fell. Liu and his strategist Lu Wenruo () tried to flee to Tufan, but soldiers that Gao sent after them intercepted them. Liu was captured, while Lu committed suicide. It was said that Gao maintained military discipline, and that the people of Chengdu were not at all disturbed. He executed Xing and another officer of Liu's, Shen Yan (), but spared all of Liu's other subordinates. When it was suggested to him that he offer Liu's two beautiful concubines to Emperor Xianzong, he believed that doing so for imperial favor was improper; instead, he gave them to two of his officers who were not married. = After campaign against Liu Pi = Emperor Xianzong, after reallocating six prefectures from Xichuan to Dongchuan, made Gao Chongwen the military governor of Xichuan, the mayor of Chengdu, and acting Sikong (Âè∏Á©∫, one of the Three Excellencies). He also created Gao the Prince of Nanping and ordered that a commemorative text of Gao's victory be engraved at Lutou. It was said that as Gao was illiterate, he disliked the frequent paperwork that was involved in overseeing the prosperous city of Chengdu, and he often requested to be transferred to a border region. In 807, Emperor Xianzong had the chancellor Wu Yuanheng replace him, and moved him to Binning Circuit (ÈÇ†ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi). Emperor Xianzong also made him the overall commander of the troops west of the capital Chang'an and gave him the honorary chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (). It was said that because of Gao's achievements, he became arrogant and wasteful, and when he left Chengdu, he took much of the wealth of the region with him. Because he was not familiar with the rituals at the imperial court, Emperor Xianzong exempted him from the usual custom of first paying homage to the emperor before heading to a new assignment, ordering instead that he be allowed to head directly to Binning. It was said that during the time that Gao was at Binning, he repaired and strengthened the defenses. He died in 809 and was given posthumous honors. He was later enshrined at the imperial temple with Emperor Xianzong. His son Gao Chengjian () and grandson Gao Pian also later served as major generals.

D. McLeod, USNRF, in command. Assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service, Newburgh departed New York City on 25 January 1919 with a cargo of flour, bacon, and lard consigned to the Northern Food Administration. She called briefly at Falmouth, England, on 15 February 1919, where she received orders to steam to Rotterdam, the Netherlands, to offload her cargo. After bunkering and ballasting at Plymouth, England, Newburgh departed for New York City in ballast on 3 March 1919. In mid-March 1919, during the crossing, she lost two blades from her propeller and was forced to put in at the Azores to await the shipment of a new propeller from New York City. Following repairs, she returned in early April 1919 to New York City, where she loaded a United States Army cargo of hay and oats. She delivered that cargo to Rotterdam in mid-May 1919, then returned to the United States. On the return voyage she again suffered propeller damage, and this time had to put into Bermuda for repairs and refueling, after which she returned to New York City in June 1919. Newburgh was decommissioned at New York City on 19 June 1919.

The overall approach works in jointly input-output space and an initial version was proposed by Neil Gershenfeld. Basic form of model The procedure for cluster-weighted modeling of an input-output problem can be outlined as follows. In order to construct predicted values for an output variable y from an input variable x, the modeling and calibration procedure arrives at a joint probability density function, p(y,x). Here the \\"variables\\" might be uni-variate, multivariate or time-series. For convenience, any model parameters are not indicated in the notation here and several different treatments of these are possible, including setting them to fixed values as a step in the calibration or treating them using a Bayesian analysis. The required predicted values are obtained by constructing the conditional probability density p(yx) from which the prediction using the conditional expected value can be obtained, with the conditional variance providing an indication of uncertainty. The important step of the modeling is that p(yx) is assumed to take the following form, as a mixture model: :p(y,x)=\\\\sum_1^n w_jp_j(y,x), where n is the number of clusters and {wj} are weights that sum to one. The functions pj(y,x) are joint probability density functions that relate to each of the n clusters. These functions are modeled using a decomposition into a conditional and a marginal density: :p_j(y,x)=p_j(yx)p_j(x), where: :*pj(yx) is a model for predicting y given x, and given that the input-output pair should be associated with cluster j on the basis of the value of x. This model might be a regression model in the simplest cases. :*pj(x) is formally a density for values of x, given that the input-output pair should be associated with cluster j. The relative sizes of these functions between the clusters determines whether a particular value of x is associated with any given cluster-center. This density might be a Gaussian function centered at a parameter representing the cluster-center. In the same way as for regression analysis, it will be important to consider preliminary data transformations as part of the overall modeling strategy if the core components of the model are to be simple regression models for the cluster-wise condition densities, and normal distributions for the cluster- weighting densities pj(x). General versions The basic CWM algorithm gives a single output cluster for each input cluster. However, CWM can be extended to multiple clusters which are still associated with the same input cluster. Each cluster in CWM is localized to a Gaussian input region, and this contains its own trainable local model. It is recognized as a versatile inference algorithm which provides simplicity, generality, and flexibility; even when a feedforward layered network might be preferred, it is sometimes used as a \\"second opinion\\" on the nature of the training problem. The original form proposed by Gershenfeld describes two innovations: * Enabling CWM to work with continuous streams of data * Addressing the problem of local minima encountered by the CWM parameter adjustment process CWM can be used to classify media in printer applications, using at least two parameters to generate an output that has a joint dependency on the input parameters.

The majority of the novel follows Van and Ellador's travels throughout the world, and particularly the United States, with Van curating their explorations through the then-modern world, while Ellador offers her commentary and \\"prescriptions\\" from a Herlander's perspective, discussing topics such as the First World War, foot binding, education, politics, economics, race relations, and gender relations. Like Herland, With Her in Ourland was originally published as a serial novel in Gilman's self-published magazine, The Forerunner in monthly installments starting in January of 1916 (the final chapter of Herland was published in December of 1915). Despite the fact that Herland and With Her in Ourland were both published serially and without interruption, With Her in Ourland was not re-published in a stand-alone book form until 1997, eighteen years after the re-publication of Herland. Though the majority of the novel takes place within the contemporary 1915-1916 world, due to its connection to Herland, it is often considered as part of a \\"Utopian Trilogy,\\" along with Moving the Mountain (1911) and Herland, though Gilman herself never indicated a \\"trilogy\\" structure. Publication Following the conclusion of the Herland narrative in the December 1915 issue of The Forerunner, Gilman noted that: \\"A sequel to 'Herland,' called 'With Her in Ourland,' will appear serially in THE FORERUNNER for 1916.\\" [sic] The twelve chapters of With Her in Ourland were published serially in the twelve monthly issues of The Forerunner starting in January of 1916; the novel concluded in the final issue of Gilman's periodical, which ceased publication in December 1916. Both Herland and Ourland lapsed into obscurity during the middle decades of the twentieth century. In 1968, the full run of The Forerunner was reprinted by Greenwood Reprints as part of the Radical Periodicals in the United States, 1890-1960, including the text of the Herland and With Her in Ourland. However, it was not until the re-printing of GIlman's short story, \\"The Yellow Wallpaper\\" in 1973, that interest in Gilman's work increased, leading to the re-publication of Herland as a stand-alone novel in 1979 by Pantheon Books. Despite the increased critical and scholarly work that Gilman's literary works received, With Her in Ourland remained relatively obscure. Ann J. Lane's Introduction to the 1979 Pantheon edition of Herland mentioned the existence of the sequel, and even quoted passages from With Her in Ourland. In her introduction, Lane suggested that Herland and With Her in Ourland constituted the second two books of a \\"Utopian Trilogy,\\" along with Moving the Mountain (1911), which also published serially in The Forerunner several years earlier. Nevertheless, With Her in Ourland was not re-published in stand-alone book form until 1997, with an introduction by Mary Jo Deegan.Charlotte Perkins Gilman, With Her in Ourland: Sequel to Herland, Edited by Mary Jo Deegan and Michael R. Hill, with an Introduction by Mary Jo Deegan, Westport, CT, Praeger/Greenwood Press, 1997. Since then, it has been re-printed several times, usually as a part of \\"Utopian Trilogy\\" anthologies.  Critical reception  Due to the large gap between the re-publication of Herland and With Her in Ourland, critical response to With Her in Ourland has been relatively light compared to that of Herland. In general, the critical reception to With Her in Ourland is that it is a weaker novel than its predecessor. The didactic structure of the narrative is often criticized as being less engaging than that of Herland, while some of the opinions offered by Gilman, usually in the form of Ellador's \\"prescriptions\\" are considered to be problematic by many scholars. As such, With Her in Ourland is often ignored or overlooked in scholarship about Gilman's work. Genre Both Herland and Ourland are frequently included (along with Moving the Mountain) in a \\"Utopian Trilogy\\" of serial novels written by Gilman and published in The Forerunner dealing with similar subject matter, and are generally accepted to belong to the genre of utopian and dystopian fiction, and participated in the major wave of utopian literature that characterized the later nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.Kenneth R. Roemer, The Obsolete Necessity: America in Utopian Writings, 1888-1900, Kent, OH, Kent State University Press, 1976.Jean Pfaelzer, The Utopian Novel in America, 1886-1896: The Politics of Form, Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press, 1984.Matthew Beaumont, Utopia Ltd.: Ideologies of Social Dreaming in England 1870-1900, Leiden, Brill Academic Publishers, 2005.Minna Doscow, ed., Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Utopian Novels, Madison, NJ, Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1999. Though the majority of the narrative in With Her in Ourland takes place in the contemporary world of 1915-16, the novel uses characters and situations from Herland to draw contrasts between Gilman's idealized vision of a feminist society as depicted in Herland and the darker realities of real, outside, male-dominated world. The \\"Herlander\\" perspective is used to generate commentary and critique on \\"Ourland\\". Together, the two works comprise a \\"composite utopia.\\"Polly Wynn Allen, Building Domestic Liberty: Charlotte Perkins Gilman's Architectural Feminism, Amherst, MA, University of Massachusetts Press, 1988; pp. 98-102. Ultimately, the novel ends with the main characters returning to the utopian Herland, having determined that Ourland has not yet progressed enough for the Herlanders to re-join the rest of society, suggesting a challenge to readers to help establish a world in which the Herlanders would feel welcomed. Sociology The 1997 reprint of With Her in Ourland is unusual in its emphasis on the novel's sociological aspects. Editor Mary Jo Deegan, a professor of sociology, notes in her Introduction that while most contemporary attention to Gilman's work comes from literary criticism and feminist studies, Gilman was a sociologist, recognized as such by her contemporaries, and that Ourland benefits from a reading as a work of sociology.With Her in Ourland, 1997; Introduction, pp. 2-7, 9-28 and ff. Synopsis With Her in Ourland begins where its predecessor Herland ends: Vandyck Jennings, his newlywed Herlandian wife Ellador, and the exiled Terry Nicholson proceed by airplane and motor launch away from Herland and back to the outside world. (Ourland is narrated by the Jennings character.) At an unnamed Eastern seaport, the three board a ship for the United States. Their craft is battered by a storm, however; the three travelers take alternative passage on a Swedish ship that is heading to Europe. This detour brings Van and Ellador into contact with World War I, then raging; and Ellador is devastated by the carnage and horrors of the conflict. This new dark knowledge inaugurates Ellador's education in the nature of the male-dominated world beyond Herland. Van praises the quality of her intellect -- though he regularly finds himself discomfitted as Ellador's penetrating mind examines the logical lapses and the moral and ethical failures of human society. Ellador pursues a detailed understanding of the world, interviewing and studying with historians and other experts (while keeping the existence of her own society secret). Van and Ellador take a long journey on their way to Van's home in the United States; they travel through the Mediterranean to Egypt, and then eastward through Persia and India, China and Japan. On the way, Ellador examines the differing customs of the cultures they visit. By the middle of the book, Van and Ellador arrive in San Francisco, and Ellador begins her study of American conditions. Van is forced to confront and recognize many of the inadequacies and contradictions of American culture through Ellador's patient, objective, relentless scrutiny; in the process, Gilman can advocate her own feminist program of social reform. Van has to confront the fact that Ellador's view of America rattles his previously \\"unshaken inner conviction of our superiority.\\"With Her in Ourland, Chapter 5 (p. 106 in the 1997 edition). The novel concludes with the return of Ellador and Van to Herland; they settle there, and in time Ellador gives birth to a son. Race and religion Modern critics have found unsavory elements in Gilman's works: preoccupations with eugenics and euthanasia, plus \\"racism and nativism,\\"Alys Eve Weinbaum, \\"Writing Feminist Genealogy: Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Racial Nationalism, and the Reproduction of Maternalist Feminism,\\" Feminist Studies, Vol. 27 No. 2 (Summer 2001), pp. 271-302; see p. 272. class biases and other prejudices.Susan S.

Some portions of With Her in Ourland, especially the tenth installment, bear upon this subject matter. In the novel's tenth chapter, Ellador confronts a sociologist from the American South, and examines and exposes the illogical racist assumptions of his positions.With Her in Ourland, Chapter 10 (pp. 160-1). The same chapter in Ourland also considers the status of Jews, what was then called the \\"Jewish problem\\". Gilman advocates intermarriage and assimilation of the Jews into the modern societies in which they lived.With Her in Ourland, Chapter 10 (pp. 162-6).

The overall research aim is to obtain fundamental insights into the aging process and thus to pave the way towards healthier aging in humans. An international research team drawn from almost 30 nations is working to uncover underlying molecular, physiological and evolutionary mechanisms. Located on the campus of Cologne University Hospital, this MPI forms a substantial part of a regional Life Science Cluster of closely interlinked research organizations focusing on research into ageing and ageing-associated diseases. Regional partners include the MPI for Metabolism Research and the Cluster of Excellence CECAD (both in Cologne) as well as the DZNE and caesar Research Center (both in Bonn). Together with their regional, national and international partners, such as ERIBA, researchers at the MPI for Biology of Ageing are exploring how cells age throughout the course of their life, which genes are involved and to what extent environmental factors play a role. Underlying processes are being studied in so-called model organisms: The genes of the mouse Mus musculus, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster and the roundworm Caenorhabditis elegans are known and the life expectancy of these organisms is relatively short. This makes them particularly suitable for research into the ageing process. Further model organisms in the form of the African turquoise killifish Nothobranchius furzeri and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae are in use. Since the beginning of the research work in 2008 Adam Antebi (USA), Nils-G√∂ran Larsson (Sweden) and Linda Partridge (UK) are jointly directing the institute. In 2018 Thomas Langer (Germany) was appointed as the fourth director of the institute. The foundation stone for the new research premises was laid in 2010 and the building was inaugurated in 2013. As one of the youngest institutes of the Max Planck Society, the MPI for Biology of Ageing is expanding further and should eventually have a staff of about 350. At least ten research groups are planned as well as a fourth department under the leadership of a further director.

The film was directed by Charles Lamont. Plot Doris Stanley is an adolescent singer (\\"14 going on 15\\") billed as an 11-year-old \\"child prodigy\\" by her money-hungry aunt. When Doris finds that her Aunt Addie has reneged on her promise to give her a break from her singing tour, she runs away, and finds herself in a small town. Doris presents herself as a potential adoptee to a young married couple (Ann and Steve Winters). Unbeknownst to Doris, Ann was on the verge of breaking up with Steve due to his preoccupation with golf and refusal to find a real job. Her arrival gives the couple a reason to stay together. Ann makes both friends and enemies at her new high school, as she vies for the affections of Jimmy, who is stuck on a girl (Elaine) who is toying with him. The school's music teacher, Miss Roberts, takes an interest in Doris when she realizes what a good singing voice she has. A newspaper story appears offering a 5,000 dollar reward for finding the missing Doris. The music teacher makes a trip to the city, ostensibly to claim the reward, but really to find out why Doris ran away. She then claims that the girl she knows is not Doris. The aunt is suspicious and sends a detective to follow her back to the small town. Meanwhile, Steve is determined to stay with Ann and to keep their adoptive daughter Doris, but he will need some income for the expected court battle. He applies for an insurance job, and successfully talks a stingy client into buying a large policy, thus securing a good commission and a job. After initially being written out of a music recital, Doris is allowed to perform, wowing the crowd and catching the eye and ear of the detective. The film's climax occurs in the small town courtroom, in which it is revealed that the aunt never properly adopted Doris, and that she is just old enough to freely choose her adoptive parents. She chooses the Winters couple, with the aunt being granted visitation rights. With Jimmy's prospective Prom date down with the mumps (which she caught from another boy), Jimmy sees Doris with new eyes and escorts her to the Prom. The main cast in this film had also appeared in Gloria Jean's previous film, earlier in 1942, What's Cookin'?.

Spira (born 1961) is a researcher and industry analyst known for his work in the area of collaboration and knowledge sharing and the problem of information overload. Early life Spira was born in New York and grew up in New York City and Vienna, the son of photographic pioneer Fred Spira and his wife Marilyn (n√©e Hacker). He studied Central European History at the University of Pennsylvania where he was a member of the Pi Lambda Phi fraternity 2011 Pi Lambda Phi Membership Guide and conducted his graduate studies at the University of Munich (Ludwig-Maximilians Universit√§t) Career Spira began his career in business and technology while still in high school when he became involved in the management of office systems at Spiratone, a company founded and run by Fred Spira. After completing his studies in 1983, he founded a research and IT advisory firm, Basex (originally called The Basex Group) in 1983, that focused on helping organizations understand how knowledge workers work and what they can do to manage them more effectively. He has been associated with the firm ever since. Research Spira's research focuses on the problems organizations are having as they migrate from the industrial age to the knowledge economy and what managers can do to remain competitive. According to Knowledge Management in the Public Sector,Knowledge Management in the Public Sector the main thrust of Spira's arguments is that software companies should develop new systems that are designed from the beginning for knowledge and information work but collaboration and knowledge sharing are \\"less a question of technology than of systems that facilitate people working together.\\" Spira started researching the problem of information overload in the early 1990s and was interviewed in March 1993 by CNBC on the topic. In 2003, he published research that assigned specific costs to components of the problem of information overload and in 2008 published an estimate New York Times: Read This and Cost Your Company Dough of the cost of information overload to the U.S. economy ($900 billion per annum).

The Dickin Medal is named for her.  Early life  Maria Dickin was born in 1870 in South Hackney, Middlesex, the oldest of eight children born to William George Dickin, a Wesleyan minister, and Ellen Maria Exell Dickin.Brian Harrison, ‚ÄòDickin, Maria Elisabeth (1870‚Äì1951)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2010 accessed 2 Aug 2011  Career  Dickin taught singing as a young woman, and in 1905 compiled and published Suggestive Thoughts from the Temple (1905), a collection of sayings by London minister Reginald John Campbell. She founded the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA) in 1917, in a cellar in Whitechapel. The sign on the door reflected Dickin's intent, to provide humane veterinary care to pets whose owners could not otherwise afford it: \\"Bring your sick animals/Do not let them suffer/All animals treated/All treatment free\\". In 1921, she added a horse- drawn mobile unit, to treat more animals and bring public health education to other neighborhoods; this was the first of a fleet of travelling veterinary clinics. She opened a rest home for horses and donkeys in 1928, and in 1929, she began Busy Bees, a children's club focused on animal welfare. Dickin was awarded an OBE in 1929, and raised to a CBE in 1948. During World War II, she launched the PDSA medal, for animal heroism in the war effort. In 1950, she published a memoir, The Cry of the Animal. Dickin, whose efforts depended more on the work of amateur volunteers than trained veterinarians, was opposed by the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons as \\"dangerous\\". \\"If you are so concerned about the proper treatment of Sick Animals of the Poor,\\" she responded to the professional association's criticisms, \\"Do the same work we are doing. Instead of spending your energy and time in hindering us, spend it in dealing with this mass of misery.\\"Hackney.  Personal life and legacy  Dickin married her first cousin, Arnold Francis Dickin, an accountant, in 1899; they had no children. Dickin died in London in 1951 of influenzal broncho-pneumonia, aged 80 years. The PDSA medal is now known as the Dickin Medal, and is considered the animal equivalent of the Victoria Cross. A commemorative blue plaque was erected by English Heritage at Dickin's birthplace, 41 Cassland Road (formerly 1 Farringdon Terrace) in Hackney in October 2015.

Theatrevolution was started by theatre director Chambers Stevens, community organizer Ty Brown, Brenda Fowinkle, and Donald Capparella (who is still on the board today), as a way to raise awareness of current political issues. After their first production of The Normal Heart by Larry Kramer, which dealt with the AIDS crisis, the company started to work with the State of Tennessee, dramatizing social issues for the judicial system.Hieronymus, Clara (November 30, 1986). The Sunday Tennessean. Anxious to get back to their theatrical roots, in 1988 Theatrevolution decided to produce a free Shakespeare play in Centennial Park in Nashville.Wibking, Angela (August 1‚Äì5, 1988). Nashville Business Journal.Monin, Beth (August 1, 1988). Nashville Banner.The Tennessean. June 25, 1988. Chambers Stevens, Chuck Guy, Ty Brown and Brenda Fowinkle founded and incorporated the Nashville Shakespeare Festival, whose first production was As You Like It by William Shakespeare and opened in the rain on August 5, 1988. Clara Hieronymus, the critic for The Tennessean, gave the production a rave review after watching the entire show holding an umbrella.Hieronymus, Clara (August 6, 1988). The Tennessean. That summer, more than 1,000 audience members attended the six performances. Each summer 10,000 to 15,000 audience members now attend. Since 1988, 200,000 people have attended Shakespeare in the Park. These fully staged, professional productions are presented free of charge to the public. In 1992, The Festival began offering short Shakespeare productions to Nashville public schools. Over 150,000 students have seen these performances. These tours have led to partnerships with the Nashville Institute for the Arts and the Tennessee Performing Arts Center's Humanities Outreach in Tennessee, which assisted the Festival in producing other classics such as The Belle of Amherst, The Little Prince, and Rip Van Winkle to supplement the company's Shakespearean offerings. In 2006, the Festival performed Macbeth for 23,000 people through Shakespeare in the Park, TPAC's HOT program, and in rural Tennessee with the help of a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts. In the 2006-2007 school year, the Festival reached an additional 3,000 students and community members through arts-in-education workshops and in- residence programs, including a professionally directed student production of Julius Caesar, performed by a diverse group of high school students from across Middle Tennessee. The Nashville Shakespeare Festival hosted the 2007 Conference of the Shakespeare Theatre Association, which brought over one hundred professional Shakespeare producers from around the world to Nashville. In 2008, the Bill & Carole Troutt Theater at Belmont University began to house the winter productions; here it offers school matinees and public performances of its annual Winter Shakespeare production. The Festival also offers workshops for businesses and adult groups, including certified CLE workshops for lawyers. With the goal of reading every one of Shakespeare's plays out loud in a public forum, NSF partnered with the Nashville Public Library for the \\"Shakespeare Allowed!\\" program. The readings happen on the first Saturday of each month and the complete canon was initially read by November 2011. In January 2012, NSF started at the beginning and read them all again, one play a month, until February 2015. The program is now in its 4th cycle through the canon. In 2019, after over 30 years in Centennial Park, Summer Shakespeare moved to oneC1TY, a new, multi-use development in Nashville. The Festival planned to return in the summer of 2020 with a production of What You Will (Twelfth Night), directed by Jim Warren, the Founding Artistic Director of the American Shakespeare Center, but this was cancelled due to COVID-19. Denice Hicks is the current Executive Artistic Director. She has been a staple of the organization for over 30 years.

It is located near two larger towns, 12 km south of Butwal and 10 km north of Bhairahawa. Etymology The name Bhalwari derives from the word bhal in Nepali, the Nepalese language, and means \\"force of the water\\". The settlement was named as such because it experienced frequent flooding in the past. Population Most of the population consists of Pahadi people who migrated from nearby villages. The settlement also has a significant number of Madhesi people. Culture and religion The majority of the population of Bhalwari trace their ancestry to nearby hilly regions of Palpa, Arghakhanchi, and Syangja. Because of this, Butwal's culture is significantly influenced by the Pahadi. The population is predominantly Hindu and Buddhist. The majority of the people are Gurung, Tharu, Thakuri, Brahman, Chhetri, and Magar. There are some Muslims, as well, who are of Madhesi origin. The major festivals celebrated are Holi, Teej, Maha Shivratri, Losar, Dashain, Tihar and Bhai Tika. Since the majority of the population are from nearby villages, most of them go to their native villages during the month-long festivities. From Dashain to Tihar, the town becomes nearly deserted. Economy The main economy of the Bhalwari is agriculture and small-scale industries. There is one oil store, Nepal Oil Corporation, which has 4 large tanks. There are many rice mills, including Siddhababa Rice Mill, Siddhartha Rice Mill, Om Shiva Rice Mill, Deurali Rice Mill, Pathak Rice Mill, and PnP general stores. There are other medium-scale industries, such as the JK Soap & Cosmetics and Siddhababa Distillery. There are one commercial bank, two development banks, and several co-operatives. Nabil Bank is one of these commercial banks. Bhrikutee Development Bank and Purnima Development Bank have Class B banking licenses from Nepal Rastra Bank. Transportation As in most of Nepal, buses are the major means of transportation, with many private operators running bus services between popular destinations. Until 2003, most of the bus fleet was made up of large, old buses. Since then, operators have purchased newer, smaller buses, commonly called Micro because of their small size. There is frequent Micro service between Butwal and Bhairahawa. Older vehicles are also used to ferry people to nearby hilly regions. Apart from this, rickshaws are also a popular means of transport and can be found in abundance in Bhalwari. There are also many taxies, making it is easier to go anywhere, day or night. Bicycles, motorbikes, and cars are also common means of personal transportation around town. Education There are several educational institutions in Bhalwari. There are five private primary level schools and one government school. The main educational institution of the town is Lumbini Engineering College. It is the only engineering college in the Lumbini zone. Other Private Schools include Araniko English High School, St. Joseph, Little Paradise, and one Montessori school, Pioneer Kids Montessori.

A resident of Malcolm, Haar occupies a seat in the Nebraska Legislature. He is a member of the Democratic Party. Haar was born in Freeman, South Dakota. He graduated from Lincoln High School in Lincoln, Nebraska, in 1961, then attended the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln, where he obtained a B.S. in education in 1965 and an M.S. in educational administration in 1973. He served on the Lincoln city council from 1989 to 1997. Legislative elections In 2008, Haar ran for the Legislature from the 21st Legislative District, which covers the northwestern corner of Lancaster County, including the northwestern portion of Lincoln; incumbent Carol Hudkins was ineligible to run under Nebraska's term-limits law. In the nonpartisan primary, he placed first of six candidates, receiving 28.3% of the vote; Raymond businessman James Jeffers, a Republican, came in second, with 24.9%. Haar and Jeffers, as the top two vote-getters, moved on to the general election. In the general election, Haar was targeted for defeat by anti-abortion groups, on the grounds that his wife, Chris Funk, was the head of the Planned Parenthood organization in Nebraska and western Iowa, and that Haar had voted for funding for the organization while on the Lincoln council. When the election was held, the margin was narrow enough to require a recount; this determined that Haar had won by a margin of 20 votes, with 7806 votes to Jeffers's 7786. Haar ran for re-election in 2012. In the nonpartisan primary election, he received 51.0% of the vote; Lincoln attorney Mike Hilgers took 46.2%; and Bryan C. Ifland, 2.8%. Hilgers, a Republican described by the Lincoln Journal Star as \\"Catholic and pro-life\\", stated that his chief concern was jobs and the economy, although abortion-related issues were important to him as well. Haar won the general election, with 50.3% of the vote to Hilgers's 49.7%. Legislative tenure During his first term in the Legislature, Haar sat on the Education Committee and the Natural Resources Committee. In 2015, he left those committees and was named to the Appropriations Committee. Haar has been described as a \\"leading environmentalist\\" in the Legislature. In 2011, it appeared that the U.S. State Department would soon render a decision to permit or prohibit the proposed Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry crude oil from Canada to Texas and would run across Nebraska. Haar called for a special session of the Legislature to pass legislation that would give the state authority to alter the pipeline's route; this, he said, would enable Nebraska to reject a pipeline route that crossed the Sandhills, where groundwater lies near the surface. Governor Dave Heineman called the session in November 2011; in the course of it, speaker Mike Flood announced that pipeline operator TransCanada had agreed to a change in route to bypass the Sandhills. Haar described the outcome as \\"a win-win\\". In December 2012, Haar, together with pipeline opponents Bold Nebraska and the Sierra Club, urged the state's Department of Environmental Quality to delay its report on the pipeline route, arguing that further study was necessary. In 2014, when 34 of the 49 Nebraska legislators signed a letter urging the State Department to approve the pipeline, Haar was one of three legislators who signed a letter calling for its rejection. In the 2013 legislative session, Haar introduced, and named as his priority bill, LB583, which called for a report on the effects of climate change on the state. An amendment by Beau McCoy added \\"cyclical\\" before \\"climate change\\"; McCoy, who expressed disbelief in anthropogenic climate change, stated that this would remove politics from the bill. The measure passed by a margin of 32‚Äì12 and was signed by governor Heineman. When the Nebraska Department of Agriculture issued its request for information for the study, it interpreted the amended phrasing as excluding human-caused changes, an interpretation to which Haar took strong exception, appearing on The Rachel Maddow Show to say so. Eventually, the study was cancelled, after the University of Nebraska‚ÄìLincoln announced that it would do its own study of the matter.

Seven works by other trouv√®res (Jehan de Grieviler, Jehan Erart, Jaques le Vinier, Colart le Boutellier, and Mahieu de Gant) are dedicated to Bretel and he was for a time the \\"Prince\\" of the Puy d'Arras. Bretel held the hereditary post of sergeant at the Abbey of Saint Vaast in Arras, in which capacity he oversaw the rights of the abbacy on the river Scarpe. He is referred to as sergens iretavles de la riviere Saint-Vaast in a document of 1256. His father, Jehan, had held this same post from 1241 (at the latest) until his death in 1244. His grandfather, Jacques, was described as sergent h√©r√©ditaire around the turn of the century, when there were eight such officials associated with the abbey. The trouv√®re and his brother were modestly wealthy property owners near Arras, where Jehan died in 1272. Bretel wrote eight known chansons courtoises,Preserved in the Vatican Library (I-Rvat Reg.lat.1490). of which seven survive. Bretel dedicated the chanson Li miens chanters to the countess Beatrice, wife of William III of Dampierre and sister of Henry III, Duke of Brabant. Bretel also participated in eighty-nine jeux partis, nearly half of all recorded jeux partis. Many of these are assigned on the basis of internal evidence (the poets are often named) since they lack rubrics. A few of these are addressed only to a Sire Jehan or just Sire and their ascription to Bretel, though likely, is not certain. About forty different poets from the region around Arras participated in these jeux partis, either as judges or correspondents. Generally these poems are grouped with others by Bretel in the chansonniers, even if he did not initiate them, though those he initiated with the famous trouv√®re Adam de la Halle are usually grouped with Adam's works.

The mushroom is commonly known as the devil's cigar or the Texas star in the United States, while in Japan it is called . This extremely rare mushroom is notable for its unusual appearance and disjunct distribution; it is found only in select locales in Texas and Japan. The fruit body, which grows on the stumps or dead roots of cedar elms (in Texas) or dead oaks (in Japan), somewhat resembles a dark brown or black cigar before it splits open radially into a starlike arrangement of four to seven leathery rays. The interior surface of the fruit body bears the spore- bearing tissue known as the hymenium, and is colored white to brown, depending on its age. The fruit body opening can be accompanied by a distinct hissing sound and the release of a smoky cloud of spores. Fruit bodies were first collected in Austin, Texas, and the species was named Urnula geaster in 1893; later it was found in Kyushu in 1937, but the mushroom was not reported again in Japan until 1973. Although the new genus Chorioactis was proposed to accommodate the unique species a few years after its original discovery, it was not accepted as a valid genus until 1968. Its classification has also been a source of confusion. Historically, Chorioactis was placed in the fungus family Sarcosomataceae, despite inconsistencies in the microscopic structure of the ascus, the saclike structure in which spores are formed. Phylogenetic analyses of the past decade have clarified the fungus's classification: Chorioactis, along with three other genera, make up the family Chorioactidaceae, a grouping of related fungi formally acknowledged in 2008. In 2009, Japanese researchers reported discovering a form of the fungus missing the sexual stage of its lifecycle; this asexual state was named Kumanasamuha geaster. History The fungus was first collected in 1893 by botanist Lucien Marcus Underwood, who sent the specimens to mycologist Charles Horton Peck for identification. Peck described the species as Urnula geaster in that year's Annual Report of the New York State Botanist, although he expressed doubt about its generic placement in Urnula. In 1902, student mycologist Elsie Kupfer questioned the proposed classification of various species in the genera Urnula and Geopyxis, as suggested in an 1896 publication on the Discomycetes by German mycologist Heinrich Rehm. She considered Rehm's transfer of the species to the genus Geopyxis illogical: > \\"Even externally the fungus does not closely answer Rehm's own description > of the genus Geopyxis under which he places it; the texture of the > apothecium is described as fleshy, the stem, as short and sometimes thin; > while in this plant, the leathery character of the cup and the length and > thickness of the stem are its noticeable features.\\" Working with Underwood's guidance, Kupfer compared the microscopic structure of the hymenium (the fertile, spore-bearing tissue) of the Texan species with a number of similar ones‚ÄîGeopyxis carbonaria, Urnula craterium, and Urnula terrestris (now known as Podophacidium xanthomelum). She concluded that the Texan species was so dissimilar as to warrant its own genus, which she named Chorioactis. Although this taxonomical change was opposed in later studies of the fungus by Frederick De Forest Heald and Frederick Adolf Wolf (1910) and Fred Jay Seaver (1928, 1942), Chorioactis was established as a valid genus in 1968 by Finn-Egil Eckblad in his comprehensive monograph about the Discomycetes. Classification and naming Historically, Chorioactis was considered to be in the family Sarcosomataceae. A 1983 monograph on the family included Chorioactis in the tribe Sarcosomateae (along with the genera Desmazierella, Sarcosoma, Korfiella, Plectania, and Urnula), a grouping of fungi characterized by having spores lacking small, wart-like projections (verruculae) capable of absorbing blue dye. A 1994 study of the structural features of the asci and the ascospores concluded that Chorioactis was more closely aligned with the Sarcoscyphaceae, although it conceded that the layering of the cells comprising the walls of the ascus differed considerably from the other members of the family. It was not until 1999 that the results of phylogenetic analysis firmly challenged the traditional classification, showing C. geaster to be part of a distinct lineage, or clade, that includes species in the genera Desmazierella, Neournula, and Wolfina, taxa that were distributed among both families. This analysis was later corroborated when it was shown that the grouping of these four genera (by then called the \\"Chorioactis clade\\") represented a sister clade to the Sarcosomataceae, and a new family, the Chorioactidaceae, was erected to contain them. Although C. geaster shares some characteristics with the other Chorioactidaceae genera, including dark-colored superficial \\"hairs\\" on the outer surface of the fruit bodies, it is distinguished from them by its tan to orange (rather than black) hymenia. alt=A cluster of empty brown roughly circular pods that are split lengthwise into two halves hinged together on the end connected to a branch. The roughly two dozen pods are distributed among about five small twigs on a tree branch, against a background of green leaves. The specific epithet geaster alludes to members of genus Geastrum, which also open to form star- shaped fruit bodies commonly called 'earthstars'. In the United States, Chorioactis geaster is commonly known as the Texas star, or the devil's cigar. Regarding the origin of the latter name American mycologist Fred Jay Seaver commented: \\"Whether the name Devil's Cigar refers to the form of the young specimens which resemble a bloated cigar in form, as well as in color, or to the fact that the fungus appears to 'smoke' at maturity, we cannot say ... At any rate, the name is very appropriate.\\" In 1997, Texan state Senator Chris Harris filed a bill to make C. geaster the official state fungus of Texas. The bill passed the Senate but did not succeed in the House. In Japan the mushroom is called kirinomitake („Ç≠„É™„Éé„Éü„Çø„Ç±), because the immature, unopened fruit body bears a superficial resemblance to the seed pods of kiri, the empress tree (Paulownia tomentosa). Description A closed immature fruiting body, and a specimen cut open to reveal the spore-bearing surface (hymenium) alt=A hand holding a dark brown, roughly cigar-shaped object with a lengthwise split that goes about halfway down its length. The split reveals light colored tissue within; some partially obscured light colored tissue can be seen out on the far edge, suggesting a similar split on that side Young specimens of C. geaster have a hollow, club-shaped, dark-brown fruit body, connected to a stem. The stem, which is usually buried in the ground, is shorter than the hollow fruit body or equals it in length, although the stem length is somewhat variable depending on the depth of the underground root to which it is attached. The flesh of the stem and the wall of the fruit body are white, while the inner surface is yellowish-white, turning light brown with age. The fruit body varies in width from in the thickest portion, and has a length of ; the stem is wide by long. Both stem and fruit body are covered by a dense layer of soft, brown, velvety \\"hairs\\", or tomentum. In maturity, the fruit body splits open into four to seven rays that curve downward, similar to mushrooms of the genus Geastrum. The spores are borne on the inner surface of the rays, which, depending on the maturity of the specimen, may range in color from whitish to saffron to salmon to butterscotch to chestnut. The leathery rays are up to thick. The fruit body remains closed until shortly before spore discharge; dehiscence (fruit body opening) is caused by the pressure exerted by swollen paraphyses‚Äîsterile (i.e., nonreproductive) cells that are interspersed between the ascospores. Dehiscence is accompanied by the release of clouds of spores, resembling smoke. The spore puffing upon rupture is thought to be caused by the sudden change in relative humidity between the interior chamber of the fruit body and the outside environment. Dehiscence is accompanied by a hissing sound, an auditory phenomenon known to occur in about 15 other fungal species. =Microscopic characteristics= alt=Drawing of an oblong object with somewhat pointed ends, and with five internal clear circular areas of varying sizes Spores are oblong to spindle-shaped, and are flattened on one side; they have dimensions of 54‚Äì68 ¬µm by 10‚Äì13 ¬µm. The spores each contain three to five oil drops. Although the spores have been described as smooth in older literature, when viewed with transmission electron microscopy, they are seen to have minute spots or punctures. The spores develop simultaneously (synchronously) within the ascus, a developmental feature shared with the Sarcoscyphaceae genera Cookeina and Microstoma. Like other members of the Pezizales order, the asci of C. geaster have an operculum‚Äîa \\"lid\\"‚Äîthat opens when the spores are discharged. However, the operculum of C. geaster develops a two-layered ring zone upon dehiscence, making it structurally distinct from members of both the Sarcosomataceae and the Sarcoscyphaceae families. Similar to other Discomycetes, the fruit body consists of three distinct layers of tissue: the hymenium, the hypothecium, and the excipulum. The spore-bearing hymenium, the outermost layer of cells, contains asci interspersed with sterile cells called paraphyses. In C. geaster, the club-shaped asci are 700‚Äì800 ¬µm long and 14‚Äì17.25 ¬µm thick; they are abruptly constricted at the base to a narrow pedicel. The paraphyses are initially filamentous or thread-like (filiform) but swell with age to resemble a string of beads (moniliform). The swelling of the paraphyses is believed to cause the expansion of the hymenium and subsequent splitting of the fruit body into rays; this development places the asci into an optimal position for spore release and dispersal. Supporting the cells of the hymenium is a thin layer of tightly interwoven hyphae called the hypothecium, and underneath this is a thick layer of loosely interwoven hyphae known as the excipulum. This tissue layer, analogous to parenchyma found in plants, gives the tissue a fibrous texture. The excipulum layer averages 34 ¬µm in diameter, while the hypothecium is 10‚Äì14 ¬µm. When viewed with electron microscopy, the dark brown \\"hairs\\" on the surface of the fruit body can be seen to be adorned with conical warts or spines. =Anamorph form= Many fungi have an asexual stage in their lifecycle, in which they propagate via asexual spores called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage‚Äîor teleomorph stage‚Äîis later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. In 2004, researchers reported a connection between C. geaster and the appearance of blackish-brown tufted structures on rotting wood. By comparing the internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA from the two organisms, they established a phylogenetic connection between Chorioactis and the fungus they called Conoplea aff. elegantula. However, they were unable to induce the new organism to grow on artificial media, and did not definitively establish a teleomorph-anamorph connection between the fungi. In 2009, Japanese researchers found a similar fungus growing on rotting logs that were normally associated with the growth of C. geaster; they were able to grow the organism in axenic cultures from single-spore isolates of C. geaster. Until the one fungus, one name rule was enacted in 2011, the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permitted the recognition of two (or more) names for one and the same organism, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph(s). So Nagao et al. named the anamorph Kumanasamuha geaster due to its morphological similarity with species in the genus Kumanasamuha. Distribution, ecology, and habitat Chorioactis geaster has a disjunct distribution, and has only been collected from Texas, Oklahoma, and Japan. The first reported collection in Japan was in Kyushu in 1937, and then it was not collected again in that location until 36 years later. In 2006, it was observed in a humid forest near Kawakami, Nara Prefecture. The fungus's natural habitat in Japan is disappearing because of the practice of deforestation and replanting with Japanese cedar (Cryptomeria japonica). This rare mushroom has been put on the list of threatened species in Japan. In Texas, the fungus has been reported in Collin, Hays, Travis, Dallas, Denton, Guadalupe, Tarrant, Hunt, and Bell Counties. Travis, Hays, and Guadalupe Counties are in central Texas, while the remainder are clustered together in the northeastern part of the state. Its habitat may be threatened in Texas by industrialization.The fungus was reported from Choctaw County, Oklahoma, in 2017, the first record in North America outside of Texas. Although the species is considered rare due to its globally restricted distribution, it may be locally abundant. alt=A star-shaped mushroom with four rays growing on the ground, surrounded by dead leaves: The interior surface of the mushroom is butterscotch colored, and the center of the mushroom is cracked to reveal the white tissue layer underneath. The external surface is rough, and a dark brown color. Although it is not known definitively, Chorioactis is believed to be saprobic, deriving nutrients from decomposing organic matter. In Texas, fruit bodies are found growing singly or in groups from roots, stumps, and dead roots of cedar elm trees (Ulmus crassifolia) or Symplocos myrtacea; in Japan, the usual host is dead oak trees. Fruit bodies can be clustered together close to the base of the stump, or from the roots away from the stump; the stem of the fruit body tends to originate from a point below the ground. In Texas, fruit bodies usually appear between October and April, as this period is associated with somewhat cooler weather, and the temperature and moisture conditions during this time seem to be more favorable for growth. Scientists do not know why the fungus mysteriously lives only in Texas and Japan, locations of approximately the same latitude, but separated by . Fred Jay Seaver commented \\"this is only another illustration of the unusual and unpredictable distribution of many species of the fungi. It would be difficult indeed to account for it, and we merely accept the facts as they are.\\" In 2004, a research study compared the DNA sequences of both populations and used a combination of molecular phylogenetics and molecular clock calculations to estimate the extent of genetic divergence. It concluded that the two populations have been separated for at least 19 million years, ruling out the possibility of human introduction of the species from one location to the other. Although no consistent differences in morphology are seen between the two populations, several differences exist in their life histories. The preferred host of Texan populations is typically roots and stumps of Ulmus crassifolia, while the Japanese populations tend to grow on the fallen trunks of Symplocos myrtacea and Quercus gilva. Texan species grow in areas subjected to periodic flooding, unlike their Japanese counterparts. Finally, only Japanese specimens can be grown in culture‚Äîthe spores of Texan material have not been successfully germinated on artificial media. References 37\\\\. Shugg, J (2018).

It is known from a skull and jaws from Lower Jurassic rocks of Yunnan, China. Phyllodontosuchus is unusual because some of its teeth were leaf-shaped, like those of some herbivorous dinosaurs, and it does not appear to have been a strict carnivore like most other crocodylomorphs. History and description Phyllodontosuchus is based on BVP568-L12, a crushed skull and jaws recovered from the Sinemurian-age Dark Red Beds of the Lufeng Formation near Dawa in Yunnan. A Morganucodon skull was also recovered from this locality. BVP568-L12 is only long and imperfectly preserved; it was first thought to represent an early ornithischian dinosaur. Sutures are not visible, so despite the small size, the specimen appears to have come from an adult. Phyllodontosuchus was named in 2000 by Jerald Harris and colleagues. The type species is P. lufengensis, in reference to the Lufeng Formation. There were 17 or 18 teeth per side in the upper jaw, which differed in shape depending on where they were in the jaw (heterodonty). The first five or six were pointed, conical, and curved backward. The following twelve were leaf- or spade-shaped, with fine crenelations on the trailing edge. These are similar to the teeth of some prosauropods and early ornithischians, but differ in important features. For example, the teeth lacked the swellings and ridges seen in the teeth of early ornithischians like Lesothosaurus, and the coarse denticles (smaller points) of leaf-shaped ornithischian and prosauropod teeth in general. Phyllodontosuchus also lacked a predentary as found in all known ornithischians. Instead, it is most similar to sphenosuchians. Heterodonty is known in several sphenosuchians, including Dibothrosuchus, Hesperosuchus, Pedeticosaurus, and Sphenosuchus. These forms had similar divisions of pointed and recurved anterior teeth and less pointed middle and posterior teeth, which could have been the ancestral state for the leaf-shaped teeth of Phyllodontosuchus. Small heterodont crocodylomorphs are known from other lineages as well, including Edentosuchus, Chimaerasuchus, and Malawisuchus. These small, variably-toothed crocodylomorphs are thought to have had diets beyond the typical carnivory/piscivory of modern crocodilians, possibly including some degree of herbivory. If Phyllodontosuchus did eat plants, it probably did not grind them in the jaws, though. Notes The tooth count in the abstract and diagnosis is 6 conical teeth and 12 leaf-shaped teeth, while the body of the paper describes a total of 17 teeth per side, ?5 of which are conical.

Background Major General Quincy A. Gillmore ordered a provisional division assembled under the command of Brigadier General Edward E. Potter. Potter was ordered to destroy the railroads in the area between Florence, Sumter, and Camden. The importance of the mission was pointedly made by Sherman's statement that \\"Those cars and locomotives should be destroyed if to do it costs you 500 men.\\" Potter took command of the provisional division on April 1, 1865, at Georgetown. The division numbered 2,700 men composed of two infantry brigades and auxiliary troops. The First Brigade commanded by Col. Philip P. Brown commander of the 157th N.Y consisted of: :*157th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment augmented by a detachment of the 56th N.Y. Veteran Volunteer Infantry :*25th Ohio Veteran Volunteer Infantry :*107th Ohio Volunteer Infantry The Second Brigade, commanded by Col. Edward Needles Hallowell, commander of the 54th Massachusetts consisted of: :*54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry :*32nd Regiment United States Colored Troops :*102nd Regiment United States Colored Troops In addition small detachments of the 1st New York Engineers, 4th Massachusetts Cavalry and two guns of Battery B 3rd New York Artillery accompanied the two infantry brigades. Battle On Easter Day, April 9, 1865, the Battle of Dingle's Mill was fought south of Sumterville. At approximately three in the morning, General Edward E. Potter's army, called Potter's Raiders, came from the direction of Kingstree. They were joined by Col. Edward Needles Hallowell's troops, who had crossed the Pocotaligo River, throwing Colonel Presley's men across Turkey Creek. This put them north of the pond at Dingle's Mill. Confederate militiamen, under the command of Col. James Fowler Pressley, dug in their heels behind meager breastworks and awaited the arrival of the Union forces. The two working pieces of artillery were commanded by Lt. William Alexander McQueen and a patient of Sumter hospital, Lt Pamerya, an artilleryman from New Orleans. A third piece of artillery was too rusted to work.Trudeau, p. 248. General Potter ordered Col. Hallowell to attack from the left and rear. The 54th was a part of this flanking column. Unable to reach the Rebels' position, the United States Colored Troops countermarched to where Colonel Brown's First Brigade was stationed on the main road. A Confederate volunteer remembered hearing \\"the church bells in town ringing for afternoon service\\"Trudeau, p. 249. as the battle got underway. Hallowell's brigade reached their comrades a little after two in the afternoon. Lt. McQueen was struck in the shoulder, incapacitating him, while Lt. Pamerya was killed by a minie ball in the forehead. The Confederate forces fell back toward Sumterville in the face of overwhelming odds. They made one more stand, but left the field of battle about six in the evening, ending the battle. Aftermath At about this same time, General Robert E. Lee was meeting with General Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Courthouse, away. The Confederate force disbanded and returned to their homes after fighting the battle. :*Southern losses were six killed, seven wounded, two captured. :*Northern losses were four killed, twenty-three wounded. One witness, W. H. Garland of Fernandina, Florida, claimed at least fifteen additional Northern forces were dead where they had crossed the swamp, and were buried in shallow graves which were dug up and robbed by camp followers of General Potter. After the battle, the camp followers also hanged Mr. Bee, an elderly Charleston gentleman who had fled to Sumter County from Charleston during the war. His home was located near what is now called Bee Street, probably east of Manning Avenue. NotesReferences *Trudeau, Noah Andre. Out of the Storm: The End of the Storm, April‚ÄìJune 1865.

It ran from October 3, 1959, to January 9, 1960. Overview Five Fingers itself was based on the book Operation Cicero (1950) by Ludwig Carl Moyzisch, and on the memoirs of Elyesa Bazna (I Was Cicero, 1962). Bazna was something of an antihero in real life, as was his counterpart, Ulysses Diello, in the Hollywood film. The television series transformed the character from a World War II-era mercenary Albanian into a Cold War-era heroic American. Sebastian posed as a Communist to gain information on party activities. His public cover was that of a theatrical booking agent for clubs and cafes throughout Europe. Cast David Hedison starred as Victor Sebastian, an American counterintelligence officer with the code name \\"Five Fingers\\".

History of Preciosa The history of glassmaking in Jablonec region has been written since the 14th century. In 1711 the Fisher brothers brought the secrets of crystal cutting and polishing to North Bohemia. During the 19th century, Jablonec nad Nisou became the world center of jewelry industry. In 1724, the first factory specialized in manufacturing and export of crystal chandeliers was established in Pr√°che≈à near Kamenick√Ω ≈†enov. Bohemian chandeliers were ordered for the Royal Courts‚ÄîVersailles and Fontainebleau palaces of Louis XV, Sultan Osman III of the Ottoman Empire, and Empress Elizabeth of Russia. In 1743 Czech master craftsmen created a marvelous chandelier in honor of the coronation of Empress Maria Theresa which still bears her name. The development of jewelry and glass companies, which were established and prospered in North Bohemia at the turn of the 19th century, was interrupted by World War II. In 1945 the seven main crystal factories and 18 small firms in and around Jablonec nad Nisou merged, forming the Preciosa company. Preciosa was officially established on April 10, 1948.http://www.preciosa.com/en/company/preciosa-group/company-s-history.html During the Communist era (1948‚Äì1989) the history of the Preciosa company became one of close collaboration with the oppressive institutions of the Communist regime. In the period from the 1960s to the 1980s, Preciosa became an integral part of the notorious Minkovice labour camp (Vƒõznice Minkovice) set up by the Communist government in 1958 and now known as one of the most brutal Communist prison camps in Czechoslovakia: it was nicknamed by prisoners ‚ÄúThe Red Hell‚Äù or ‚ÄúMinkau‚Äù (after the Nazi concentration camp in Dachau).http://liberecky.denik.cz/zpravy_region/rikali-jsme-mu-rude- peklo20110609.htmlhttp://www.kriminal-minkovice.wbs.cz/Zprava-o-tajnem- projektu-lagru-KSC.htmlhttp://www.kriminal-minkovice.wbs.cz/Seminar- minkovickych-veznu-862011.html There are credible testimonies, by a number of political prisoners held in the camp in the 1980s, of prisoners being severely physically abused by some of the guards, including the notorious Josef Vondru≈°ka, to the point of torture; with the abuse resulting in permanent damage to the prisoners' health and, at least on one occasion, in the death of a prisoner.https://www.respekt.cz/tydenik/2007/36/vsichni-dobri- bacharihttp://www.kriminal-minkovice.wbs.cz/Seminar-minkovickych- veznu-862011.htmlhttp://www.kriminal-minkovice.wbs.cz/jednotlive-osudy.html According to a number of testimonies, Minkovice prisoners were forced to work in the Preciosa factory under inhuman conditions, suffering from lack of food, lack of breaks, unbearable heat, toxic work environment made worse by the lack of medical care, and they were constantly facing impossible work demands linked to threats of brutal punishment for failing to fulfil them, such as being held in concrete isolation cells for days and sometimes weeks.http://www.kriminal-minkovice.wbs.cz/Zprava-o-tajnem-projektu-lagru- KSC.htmlhttps://www.sinagl.cz/domaci-zpravodajstvi/3366-sest-otazek-a-sest- desivych-odpovedi-na-tema-komunisticky-koncentrak-minkovice-1958-1990.html The profits of the Preciosa company under the Communist regime were thus due largely to the Communist prisoners' slave labour.

At the age of 22, having graduated from the University of Washington, she traveled in a traditional dugout canoe converted to include oars and named in an acronym of her brothers first names (Bill, Jack, Bob, and Jim), Bijaboji. She celebrated her 23rd birthday in Butedale on the east side of Princess Royal Island during her trip. The trip Bijaboji is a traditional Alaska native dugout canoe, carved from red cedar. In 1931 the United States Coast Guard found the canoe floating in the vicinity of the San Juan Islands, Washington. After no owner claimed it, Lowman's father, Ray, acquired it, her brothers painted it red, strengthened it with four oak ribs, fitted it with oarlocks, and Ray gave it to Betty on her 18th birthday. Four years later she departed with a friend on June 15, 1937, from the north beach on Guemes Island, Washington, against her father's wishes, and arrived solo in Ketchikan on August 19, 66 days later. Her friend, Florence Steele, returned home after a week when her smallpox vaccination resulted in a strong reaction. Lowman continued on alone, in a trip which featured several swampings of the canoe, frequent side trips and tows from friendly boaters, and almost daily contact, and bacon and egg breakfasts, with friendly locals. While a lost Amelia Earhart garnered international coverage during the same weeks, the \\"co-ed canoeist\\" generated significant media attention along the British Columbia coast. Later years After the adventure, for several years Lowman toured the US giving lectures of the adventure, during which time she met and later married Neil Carey. They homesteaded on the West Coast of Moresby Island in Puffin Cove, Haida Gwaii. They eventually moved to Sandspit, Haida Gwaii, British Columbia, where the couple resides as of 2010. In 1963, Lowman, aged 49, repeated the trip in the opposite direction, rowing Bijaboji from Ketchikan to Anacortes, Washington. From 1999 to 2007, Bijaboji was displayed at the Sandspit Airport, and now is a permanent exhibit at the Anacortes History Museum, Washington. At age 90, Lowman wrote a memoir of her the trip, published in 2004 as Bijaboji: North to Alaska by Oar ().

In 2010, the Cougars brought back Jeremy Kench to Christchurch and picked up Aidan Daly, but they failed to make the playoffs as they finished seventh with a 9‚Äì9 record. Following the 2010 season, the Cougars ran into financial issues. In January 2011, the team was kicked out of Cowles Stadium due to unpaid debt to the city council. The Gardiners intended to move their team to a new stadium just being finished in Lincoln on the outskirts of the city. However, following the Christchurch earthquake, the Cougars were forced to withdraw from the NBL in March 2011. Last-gasp meetings by Amy and Andrew Gardiner attempted to stitch together a rescue package to save the Cougars, but ultimately the level of financial risk was too great. In April 2013, the Cougars were rumoured to be ready to re-enter the NBL within two years. This did not eventuate, and in November 2013, the Canterbury Rams were granted re- entry into the league thanks to the efforts of Christchurch businessman Andrew Harrison.

Vernon Yard is a small mews off the Portobello Road in Notting Hill. Although Virgin owned a controlling interest in the label, they let Vernon Yard operate as a traditional indie (much like Virgin's relationship with Caroline Records), and therefore very few Vernon Yard releases were distributed by Virgin. In fact, Vernon Yard used many different distributors throughout its run, primarily the aforementioned Caroline, but also competing major label Capitol Records and other willing distributors. The label had a strong relationship with Virgin's British indie, Hut Records, importing Hut bands into the USA, and sending Vernon Yard-signed acts over to the UK for release on Hut. The label was known for its emphasis on modern psychedelic rock and its many subgenres, including shoegaze (The Verve), slowcore (Acetone and Low), and indie Britpop (The Auteurs). Although the Vernon Yard label would still pop up occasionally up to the early 21st century, Virgin took greater control over the label in 1997, leading many key acts to leave the label. Virgin wanted to heavily promote The Verve's 1997 Urban Hymns and, as such, released the album on Virgin and not Vernon Yard. The label's other two most popular acts, Acetone and Low, left for Vapor Records and Kranky Records, respectively, around the same time. These moves effectively left Vernon Yard without its key artists, and only a handful of releases on Vernon Yard have appeared over the years.

Grips between individual skydivers can be on any part of the hand/arm or legs. The jumpsuits worn are specifically designed with handle-like grips to assist.

For a small dropzone operating only a small Cessna aircraft that seats 5 people, anything over 5 may be considered \\"big\\". However, for dropzones with aircraft that take more people, 6 would be considered small. There are courses available for skydivers to train to jump on formations of 100 or greater.

It was the last film of the influential but troubled RKO Radio Pictures studio, which co-produced it with Fuller's own Globe Enterprises. It was filmed at the RKO Forty Acres backlot. Distribution was handled by Columbia Pictures. Verboten! was the first of Samuel Fuller's films to be set during World War II, of which he was a veteran. He had previously drawn on his war experience to make movies about the Korean War and the French Indochina War. Raymond Harvey was the film's technical adviser; he had previously worked with Fuller on his Fixed Bayonets! (1951). Plot Near the end of World War II in Europe, American soldier Sergeant David Brent (James Best) loses two men and is himself wounded while hunting down and killing a sniper in a German city. He falls unconscious in front of a young German woman, Helga Schiller (Susan Cummings). When he awakes, he finds that she has tended his wound rather than killing him. She also protects him from her bitter younger brother, Franz (Harold Daye). When the SS set up an artillery observation post in Helga's building, she hides David to prove she is not a Nazi. Later, the Americans capture the city, and David is sent to a hospital. After Germany surrenders, David returns to the city and marries Helga, despite being warned by his commanding officer. Because American soldiers are verboten (forbidden) to fraternize with German women, he resigns from the Army and goes to work in the Food Office of the Military Government. One day, Helga spots a friend, returning German soldier Bruno Eckhart (Tom Pittman). She breaks the news to him that his parents were killed by Allied bombs and his girlfriend committed suicide because she mistakenly believed the Russians were coming. Bruno congratulates her on landing someone she herself calls her \\"American goldmine\\". She persuades David to vouch for him, which enables Bruno to get one of the scarce good jobs, as a policeman. What neither Helga nor David know is that Bruno is a member of Werwolf, a Nazi organization bent on regaining control of Germany, beginning with sabotage and sneak attacks. Bruno uses his position to infiltrate other Werwolf members into the government and becomes their leader. Franz also joins the organization. When a food shipment is hijacked by Werwolf, the German civilians blame the Americans and demonstrate in front of the building where David works. David is fired after he foolishly attacks their spokesman and is pummeled by the mob. Bruno turns David against Helga, even though she is pregnant, by telling the American that she married him only for the food and shelter he could provide. When David confronts Helga, she admits that it was true to begin with, but that she eventually fell in love with him; he does not believe her and storms out. Meanwhile, Franz's conscience begins troubling him after he witnesses an incident at Bruno's secret Werwolf headquarters in a railroad boxcar. After a Werwolf bitterly protests against the theft of medicine intended for the German people, Bruno stabs him to death. When Franz has a nightmare about the murder, Helga discovers that he is part of Werwolf. Determined to show him the error of his ways, she takes him to the first session of the Nuremberg Trials. Horrified by what he learns, he reveals what he knows, enabling the Americans to smash the Werwolf operation in the area. Upon learning what Helga did, David reconciles with her. Franz goes to the boxcar to retrieve an invaluable list of Werwolf members, but is caught in the act by Bruno. In the ensuing struggle, Franz manages to knock Bruno out, but is trapped inside when the boxcar catches fire. David rushes in and rescues his brother-in-law. Production In January 1950 the Los Angeles Times reported that the film would be made on location in Germany by Solar Productions, a newly formed company consisting of Dane Clark, Sam Fuller and James Wong Howe; Clark would star, Fuller would write and direct and Howe would shoot it (Howe and Fuller had just made Baron of Arizona together). However Fuller went on to make two Korean War movies for 20th Century Fox instead. In August 1951 he announced he wanted to make Verboten in Germany with Gene Evans. However the movie was not made for a number of years. In 1954 the Los Angeles Times reported that Terry Moore wanted to star in the film for Fuller with Howard Hughes to produce. In September 1957 Hedda Hopper announced Fuller would make the film for RKO. One of the cast, Tom Pittman, died in a car crash in November 1958. Critical reception The Los Angeles Times called it \\"rather potent.\\"'Verboten' Presents Study of Nazi Youth Los Angeles Times 28 Aug 1959: 27. The New York Times called it \\"a fast, unpretentious melodrama... that may lack subtlety but coveys a sharp, uncluttered impression of contemporary European attitudes towards Americans.\\" Verboten! is held in fairly high esteem by contemporary critics. In his short review for the Chicago Reader, Dave Kehr referred to the film as \\"sleazy masterwork,\\" describing it as \\"sweaty, claustrophobic, occasionally frenzied, and often brilliant.\\" The Time Out Film Guide summarizes the movie as \\"the great Fuller at his punchy, unsubtle best,\\" adding that \\"Fuller's methods may not be sophisticated, but they are complex; as such, his own inimitably brash brand of didactism makes for riveting and powerful cinema.\\" Home video Warner Archives released Verboten! on DVD in the United States on June 22, 2010.

His views also caused controversy within the ranks of black organizations and the entertainment industry. Robeson was never officially identified as a member of the Communist Party USA (CPUSA), domestically or internationally. Robeson's beliefs in socialism, his ties to the CPUSA and leftist trade unions, and his experiences in the USSR continue to cause controversy among historians and scholars as well as fans and journalists. First visit to the Soviet Union (1934) Robeson journeyed to the Soviet Union in December 1934, via Germany, having been given an official invitation. While there, Robeson was welcomed by playwrights, artists and filmmakers, among them Sergei Eisenstein who became a close friend.Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, pg 189. Robeson also met with African Americans who had migrated to the USSR including his two brothers-in-law.Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, pg 185. Robeson was accompanied by his wife, Eslanda Goode Robeson and his biographer and friend, Marie Seton. He and his wife Eslanda were nearly attacked by Nazi Sturmabteilung at the stopover in Berlin.Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, pg 184 =Soviet constitution and anti-racist climate= Robeson recounted how Russian children and strangers approached him in the streets and offered to shake his hand. Robeson quickly became captivated with the Soviet experiment and its leadership, also declaring that African-American spiritual music resonated to Russian folk traditions. He told the press: > Here, I am not a Negro but a human being for the first time in my life ... I > walk in full human dignity. Robeson also took great interest in Article 123 of the Soviet Constitution which unlike the laws of the US at the time, effectively barred racial discrimination. During this time Robeson also commented about the recent execution after court-martial trial of people described by The Daily Worker as \\"counter-revolutionary terrorists\\": > From what I have already seen of the workings of the Soviet government, I > can only say that anybody who lifts his hand against it ought to be shot! Robeson's early views on the USSR and communism Through his writings and speeches during the mid-to-late 1930s, Robeson would go on to champion the cultural and political revolutions of the Soviet Union especially, as Robeson put it, \\"its national minority policy as it operates among the peoples of Central Asia.\\"Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, pg 187. Robeson also advocated the similarities he found between blacks all over the world and the Russian peoples, urging African Americans to look towards the Soviet Union for inspiration in gaining full citizenship within the United States. Robeson also hoped that African countries would follow the example of the USSR and embrace socialism. Robeson studied Russian language and Russian history intensely during the inter-war period .name= \\"David Levering Lewis, Artist and Citizen: Paul Robeson the USSR, Rutgers University Press, New Jersey, 1999. Paul Robeson's laudatory remarks for the socialist revolutions and decolonization of Africa and Asia were not considered controversial during this pre-Cold War era partially because Robeson himself publicly stated that his interest in the Soviet Union was \\"non-political\\" and because the USSR was not yet considered an enemy of the US. Robeson would eventually have his son educated in Moscow, widely announcing to the press that he did not want his son to face the \\"same discrimination that he had faced growing up in the United States.\\"Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, pg 1207. =Reactions to Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact= When Robeson was given the news of Stalin's 1939 non aggression pact with Hitler, also known as the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact, he saw the agreement as having been forced on the Soviets by the unwillingness of the military forces of Great Britain and France \\"to collaborate with the Soviet Union in a real policy of collective security\\", personally writing in his journal that an Anglo-Russian pact \\"would have stopped Nazi aggression\\" and thus leaving the USSR with no alternative choices in shoring up its borders.Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, pg 232. =Tenney Committee statement= In 1946, Robeson was questioned by the Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities in California, informally known as the Tenney Committee. When he was asked whether he was a member of the Communist Party, Robeson replied that he might as well have been asked whether he was a registered Democrat or Republican‚Äîin the United States the Communist Party was equally legal. But, he added, he was not a Communist.Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, pg 307.Duberman, pp. 307-308 There is no clear evidence that Robeson ever was a member of the Communist Party. According to records released under the Freedom of Information Act, the FBI believed that Robeson might have joined the Party under the name \\"John Thomas\\" but \\"his Communist Party membership book number is not known\\". Robeson's biographer, Martin Duberman, concludes that \\"he was never a member of CPUSA, never a functionary, never a participant in its daily bureaucratic operations\\". Paul Robeson, Jr. has also stated on numerous times that his father was never a member of the CPUSA. =Mundt-Nixon Bill and Smith Act= Robeson opposed anti-communist legislation. In 1948, he opposed a bill calling for registration of Communist Party members and appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Questioned about his affiliation with the Communist Party, he refused to answer, stating \\"Some of the most brilliant and distinguished Americans are about to go to jail for the failure to answer that question, and I am going to join them, if necessary.\\"Bay Area Paul Robeson Centennial Committee, Paul Robeson Chronology (Part 5) . (The bill was ultimately defeated in the Senate.) In 1949, he spoke in favor of the liberty of twelve Communists (including his long-time friend Benjamin Davis, Jr.) convicted under the Smith Act, which criminalized various left- and right-wing activities as seditious.Bay Area Paul Robeson Centennial Committee, Paul Robeson Chronology (Part 6) .  Itzik Feffer meeting and concert in Tchaikovsky Hall (June 1949) In June 1949, during the 150th anniversary celebration of the birth of Alexander Pushkin, Robeson visited the Soviet Union on a major tour including a concert at Tchaikovsky Hall. Concerned about the welfare of Jewish artists, Robeson insisted to Soviet officials that he meet with Itzik Feffer a few days earlier.Stewart, pg. 225. Robeson had first met Feffer on July 8, 1943, at the largest pro-Soviet rally ever held in the United States, an event organized by the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee and chaired by Albert Einstein. Robeson then also got to know Solomon Mikhoels, the popular actor and director of the Moscow State Jewish Theater. Mikhoels also headed the Jewish Anti-Fascist Committee in the Soviet Union with Feffer as his second. After the rally, Robeson and his wife Essie had entertained Feffer and Mikhoels. According to an account by Paul Robeson Jr told to Robeson biographer Martin Duberman,Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, pg 352-354 and notes 690 in the 1980s, Robeson was disturbed as to why he could not find his many Jewish friends when he returned to the U.S.S.R. in June 1949. After several inquires, Feffer was brought to Robeson's hotel room by the State Police. He and Feffer were forced to communicate through hand gestures and notes because the room was bugged. Feffer indicated that Mikhoels had been murdered in 1948 by the secret policeDuberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, pg 352-354. and intimated that he also was going to be killed. Feffer in fact was executed along with 14 other Jewish intellectuals three years later. After the talk with Feffer Robeson would ask his friend Pete Blackman to \\"stick around\\" him during their stay in Moscow, he would also caution Blackman to \\"watch what he said\\" around party officials. =Accounts of the meeting= There were no eyewitnesses who went on record, so the meeting of Paul Robeson and Itzik Feffer in Moscow has been given several varying interpretations. In recent years, Paul Robeson, Jr. has been quoted as saying that his father \\"tried to contact Soviet officials to see if anything could be done to release Feffer and other Jewish intellectuals.\\" This conflicts somewhat with his first account to Martin Duberman, which stated that his father did not act to speak out on Feffer's behalf to Soviet officials. Solomon Mikhoels' daughter published an account that is nearly identical to that of Paul Robeson Jr., with Robeson specifically requesting to see Feffer except that places the meeting in 1951 which would not have been possible, given that Robeson was without his passport.Mikhoels-Vovsi, Natalya. Vremya i mwi, Tel-Aviv 1976, pg 190 A second and more angry account by composer Dimitri Shostakovich denounces Robeson for \\"staying silent\\", claiming the meeting was in a restaurant with Feffer accompanied by police agents.Shostakovich, Dimitri. Testimony, Harper Row 1979 pgs 188-189 In The Long Journey by Slavic anthropologist Esther Markish, the author writes that Feffer, following orders from the Soviet secret police, carefully said nothing to Robeson about the purges.Markish, Esther. The Living Journey, 1978. =Robeson's speaks publicly of Feffer = Robeson spoke during his concert in Tchaikovsky Hall on June 14, about his close friendship with Feffer and the recently deceased actor Solomon Mikhoels prior to singing the Vilna Partisan song \\"Zog Nit Keynmol\\" in both Russian and Yiddish. The concert was being broadcast across the entire Soviet Union.Robeson, Paul Robeson, Jr. 2008, The undiscovered Paul Robeson: quest for freedom, 1939-1976 pg 152, into The Eye of the StormLewis, David Levering 1998, Paul Robeson:Artist and Citizen pg 226, Paul Robeson and The U.S.S.R Historian and Robeson biographer Martin Duberman writes: Robeson's spontaneous translation of the Yiddish text of the song of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising into Russian and his personal tribute to Mikhoels and Feffer were censored from the tapes of the 1949 broadcast. .\\"The Paris Speech and After\\" Duberman, Martin Paul Robeson, 1989, 352-353 Silence on Stalin Upon returning to the United States, he denied any persecution of Jews or other political prisoners, stating: \\"I met Jewish people all over the place... I heard no word about it.\\" According to Joshua Rubenstein's book, Stalin's Secret Pogrom, Robeson also justified his silence on the grounds that any public criticism of the USSR would reinforce the authority of anti-Soviet elements in the United States which, he believed, wanted a preemptive war against the Soviet Union.Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, pgs 354 A large number of Robeson biographers, including Martin Duberman, Philip S Foner, Marie Seton, Paul Robeson Jr., and Lloyd Brown, also concur with Robeson's own words, that he felt that criticism of the Soviet Union by someone of his immense international popularity would only serve to shore up reactionary elements in the U.S., the same elements that had lifted his passport, blocked anti-lynching legislation, and maintained a racial climate in the United States that also allowed Jim Crow, impoverished living conditions for all races and a white supremacist domination of the US government to continue. Robeson is on record many times as stating that he felt the existence of a major socialist power like the USSR was a bulwark against Western European capitalist domination of Africa, Asia and the Caribbean. Jackie Robinson's testimony to HUAC (April 1949) At the World Congress of Partisans for Peace held in Paris on April 20, 1949, Robeson made the widely publicized controversial comments that American blacks would not support the United States in a potential post-World War II war with the Soviet Union. The subsequent controversy caused the House Committee on Un- American Activities (HUAC) to investigate Robeson. HUAC sought the testimony of the African American baseball star Jackie Robinson on the subject. In July 1949, Robinson eventually agreed to testify before HUAC, fearing that declining to do so might negatively and permanently damage his career. His testimony was a major media event, with Robinson's carefully worded statement appearing on the front page of The New York Times the following day. Views on Stalin Robeson is often criticized for continuing to support the Soviet Union after he became aware (according to his son Paul Robeson, Jr.) of state sponsored intimidation and murder of Jews. Robeson would state continually in speeches and essays that having experienced firsthand for himself during the 1930s a climate in Russia that he perceived as free from racial prejudice, he saw no western country or superpower actively attempt any comparable commitment. Robeson thus refused any pressure to publicly censure the Soviet experiment. He also stated that, the existence of the USSR was the guarantee of political balance in the world. During a 1949 address to the National Council of American-Soviet Friendship, he said:Foner,Phillip.Paul Robeson Speaks:The Negro and The Soviet Union, 1978,pgs 237 > Yes, all Africa remembers that it was Litvinov who stood alone beside Haile > Selassie in Geneva, when Mussolini's sons flew with the blessings of the > Pope to drop bombs on Ethiopian women and children. Africa remembers that it > was the Soviet Union which fought the attempts of the Smuts to annex > Southwest Africa to the slave reservation of the Union of South Africa... if > the peoples of the Congo refuse to mine the uranium for the atom bombs made > in Jim Crow factories in the United States; if all these peoples demand an > end to floggings, an end to the farce of 'trusteeship' in the former Italian > colonies.... The Soviet Union is the friend of the African and the West > Indian peoples.\\"Foner,Phillip.Paul Robeson Speaks:The Negro and The Soviet > Union, 1978,pgs 238 =Stalin Peace Prize and Stalin eulogy (1952‚Äì1953)= In 1952, Robeson was awarded the Stalin Peace Prize. In April 1953, shortly after Joseph Stalin's death he wrote a eulogy entitled To You Beloved Comrade,To You Beloved Comrade\\" in the New World Review, in which he praised Stalin's \\"deep humanity,\\" \\"wise understanding,\\" and dedication to peaceful co-existence with all peoples of the world calling him \\"wise and good.\\" He also praised Stalin as a man that the world was fortunate to have for daily guidance: \\"Through his [Stalin's] deep humanity, by his wise understanding, he leaves us a rich and monumental heritage.\\"New World Review, April, 1953 Robeson's comments of praise were made prior to Nikita Khrushchev's 1956 \\"Secret Speech\\" at the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union regarding Stalin's purges. Though Robeson would continue to praise the USSR throughout his life, he would neither publicly denounce nor praise Stalin personally following Khrushchev's 1956 revelations.Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, pgs 301, 318, 440. Many historians, Robeson scholars and advocates feel that his statements about Stalin and the Peace Prize itself are routinely used out of historical context to defame or disparage his legacy by his critics.Martin Duberman Writing Robeson\\" In turn, many critics and historians feel the eulogy and prize are solid proof of his being a \\"hard line Stalinist.\\" Robeson and House Un- American Activities Committee (1956) Robeson's very vocal support of Communist countries and his outspoken political views, became a concern of the US government. Eventually he would have his passport lifted and spend eight years trying to win it back while being unwilling to sign an oath stating he was not a Communist. Robeson viewed signing such a statement and the existence of HUAC as a gross violation of every American's civil liberties. In 1956, Robeson was called before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) after he refused to sign an affidavit affirming that he was not a Communist. In response to questions concerning his alleged Communist Party membership, Robeson reminded the Committee that the Communist Party was a legal party and invited its members to join him in the voting booth before he invoked the Fifth Amendment and refused to respond. Robeson lambasted Committee members on civil rights issues concerning African Americans. When one senator asked him why he hadn't remained in the Soviet Union, he replied: \\"Because my father was a slave, and my people died to build this country, and I am going to stay here, and have a part of it just like you. And no fascist-minded people will drive me from it. Is that clear? I am for peace with the Soviet Union, and I am for peace with China, and I am not for peace or friendship with the Fascist Franco, and I am not for peace with Fascist Nazi Germans. I am for peace with decent people.\\" Shortly thereafter he stated: \\"I am here because I am opposing the neo-fascist cause, which I see arising in these committees.\\" (Audio recording of Paul Robeson's testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee, June 12, 1956) At one point he remarked, \\"you are the nonpatriots, and you are the un-Americans, and you ought to be ashamed of yourselves\\".Duberman, pp. 439-442 In making these statements, he was the only major figure to testify before HUAC who directly attacked the committee and subsequently cited for contempt of congress. The charges were later dismissed. Robeson was also cross-examined over his opinions on Stalin and if he was no longer supporting Stalin's regime or the Soviet Union. In his testimony to HUAC he stated that: \\"I have told you, mister, that I would not discuss anything with the people who have murdered sixty million of my people, and I will not discuss Stalin with you.\\" He later remarked that \\"I will discuss Stalin when I may be among the Russian people some day, singing for them, I will discuss it there. It is their problem.\\" Asked if he had praised Stalin during his previous trip to the Soviet Union, Robeson replied, \\"I do not know.\\" When asked outright if he had changed his mind about Stalin, he implored: > Whatever has happened to Stalin, gentlemen, is a question for the Soviet > Union, and I would not argue with a representative of the people who, in > building America, wasted sixty to a hundred million lives of my people, > black people drawn from Africa on the plantations.

Historian Duberman found inconsistencies with Robinson's dates but posits that it involves an issue of \\"crucial if clouded importance\\" that may shed light on Robeson's subsequent suicide attempt in Moscow, March 1961 as well as his panic attack while passing the Soviet Embassy in London, September 1961 prior to his lengthy hospitalization at the Priory for mental illness.Duberman, Martin 1989, notes for pg 735-736\\" Robinson had long since decided that Robeson was oblivious to the harsh Soviet realities, as he had refused Robinson's multiple appeals for assistance at getting out of the U.S.S.R. Robinson still recorded his astonishment when during the ball bearing factory concert (Robinson gives the date as 1961, but photographic evidence given by Duberman points to 1960), Robeson included \\"a mournful song out of the Jewish tradition, that decried their persecution through the centuries.\\"Robinson, Robert \\"Black on Red: My 44 Years Inside the Soviet Union [Acropolis 1988]pp.318-319 Singing in Yiddish, with such a \\"cry in his voice\\", such a seeming \\"pleas to end the beating, berating and killing of Jews\\", that he concluded that Robeson had made a decisive choice to protest Soviet antisemitism. Robinson also recalls conversing with Robeson's interpreter and learning that he had been singing the Jewish songs at other appearances including major concert venues. Robinson maintained having heard a rumor from five different people, none of whom knew each other and all of whom were \\"officials within the party structure\\". Robeson purportedly asked Khrushchev if stories in the Western press about the purges of Jews and widespread institutionalized antisemitism were true.name=\\"Duberman, Martin 1989, notes for pg 735-736\\" And Khrushchev had purportedly blown up at him, accusing Robeson of trying to meddle in party affairs. Robinson also claimed to \\"have never heard his records again broadcast regularly\\" on radio Moscow and \\"never read another word about him in the press.\\" Robeson would never return to the Soviet Union after his aforementioned five month hospitalization. Later views of communism (1960s) During the early days of his retirement and even after his death, rumors about his health and its connections to his supposed disillusionment with the USSR continued to persist. There were even false claims that he was living in \\"self-imposed exile in the Soviet Union\\" by The New York Times who called him \\"the disillusioned native son\\".Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, Attempted Renewal. At no time during his retirement (or his life) is Paul Robeson on record of mentioning any unhappiness or regrets about his beliefs in socialism or the Soviet Union nor did he ever express any disappointment in its leaders including Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin. Moreover, only a few sources out of hundreds interviewed and researched by two of his biographers Martin Duberman and Lloyd Brown agreed with the claims made in the mainstream media of Robeson's supposed embitterment over the USSR.Duberman, Martin. Paul Robeson, 1989, chapters \\"Broken Health\\" and \\"Attempted Renewal\\". Anna Louise Strong, the radical travel journalist, remarked in 1965 that she had always felt that \\"Paul's trouble had a deep psychosomatic cause in the shock and trauma he suffered from the Sino-Soviet split [...] Paul had a very deep love and devotion to both the USSR and for China's revolution and [...] consequently the split must have been especially hard for him, since his devotions have always been through passionate allegiance rather than through theory\\".Duberman, Martin.

The official opening of the trail took place on 31 May 2012 at the Koroit Railway station building.http://www.portfairytowarrnamboolrailtrail.com.au The trail begins in Port Fairy, running north then east through Koroit where it turns back southeast to Warrnambool. About two thirds is within Moyne Shire and one third within Warrnambool City. The overall construction cost of the project was approximately $2.2 million.http://www.portfairytowarrnamboolrailtrail.com/Port-Fairy-to- Warrnambool-Rail-Trail_about-us.htm The trail from Port Fairy to Illowa follows the path of a former branch line which ran from Port Fairy to Warrnambool and connected with the Melbourne-Ararat line, via Hamilton. This branch line was commissioned in 1884, completed in 1890. It served primarily to connect the ports of Warrnambool and Port Fairy with destinations inland. With declining port usage, the line closed in 1977.http://www.portfairytowarrnamboolrailtrail.com The trail from Illowa to Warrnambool is not on the former rail track alignment, as that section of the rail reservation has been utilized for a realignment of the Princes Highway. Instead, from Lane's Lane to Millers Lane, the trail follows the old alignment of the Princess Highway (now called Illowa Road) for several kilometres on a dedicated bicycle lane beside the roadway. The bicycle lane has been fenced off to provide greater safety. From the end of Millers Lane, the trail continues south off-road across Kelly's Swamp, then east parallel to the coast to Levy's Point. From there, the trail largely follows the cutting of the Merri River virtually all the way to the end of the trail at the Warrnambool Breakwater.http://www.portfairytowarrnamboolrailtrail.com/documents/RailTrailMap_000.pdf center File:Port Fairy Station Stevage.jpgOld station building at Port Fairy.

It was the first motion picture theater in Ohio to show a talking motion picture. The opening night film, and first talky played in Ohio was a pre-release of Paramount‚Äôs \\"Something Always Happens\\" starring Neil Hamilton and Esther Ralston. Today it serves as a community Civic Center, movie theatre, meeting place and entertainment facility.http://fox8.cityvoter.com/lorain-palace-theatre/biz/142163 The crystal chandelier, Wurlitzer pipe organ (one of only four remaining in theaters across Ohio), and two spacious loges are just some of the features which made this building worthy of being preserved.http://www.lhat.org/conference_theatre/2009/tours.asp#5 History The theatre was built as part of an initiative to rebuild downtown Lorain, following a devastating tornado destroyed most of the 44,000 inhabitant town's urban center. It still has its original Wurlitzer theatre organ and was popular well into the 1960s.http://cinematreasures.org/theater/1042/ When it was completed, it was the largest one floor motion picture theatre in Ohio.http://www.visitloraincounty.com/historical-sites Popularity of the theatre diminished following the construction of the nearby mall in the mid-1960s. Several other theatres and shops in the area closed their doors at this time. Renovation Restoration of the theatre began in 1977 and so far the non-profit organization operating the location has raised an excess of $6 million towards the cost of its restoration and renovation. Twenty-five thousand dollars was tendered as a down payment toward the purchase of the $100,000 building. A capital funds campaign was launched and in May 1977 the Palace Theater building was purchased and a grand opening was held. The Palace had been using the same carbon arc projectors since 1935. The light on the screen was created when 80 amps of electricity jumped between two large pencil-sized carbon rods. The carbon arc generated enough illumination to project the movie onto the screen away. Recently the theatre moved those projectors into the lobby and installed a new theatre system including a new platter projector, a digital projector, and a 16-speaker theatre surround sound system. In 2008 a plan was made to connect the Lorain Palace Theatre with the adjacent Eagles Building via a glass arcade. The project would partly be funded by a $200,000 granthttp://archives.legislature.state.oh.us/bills.cfm?ID=123_SB_346 from the city of Lorain, most of which would be required to purchase the Eagles Building while the rest would go to construction costs to the facade and marquee of the theatre. However, an additional $7.5 million would be needed to complete the project, which includes renovating the interior and exterior of the Eagles building, as well as a section of the theater and the construction of the arcade.http://www.chroniclet.com/2008/07/23/grant-a-wish-come-true-for- arts_122/ Lorain Palace today The Palace Theatre in Lorain continues to have funding issues but has thus far managed to hit fund-raising goals to keep its doors open. In October 2008, the theatre held a masquerade ball which helped bring in an additional $6,000. The theatre has also made several budget cuts and for now is managing to keep itself going with the aid of donations and other fund-raising efforts.

Beyond RESTful APIs, these transactions include multiple types of endpoints such as web services, ESBs, databases, mainframes, web UIs, and ERPs. API testing is performed on APIs that the development team produces as well as APIs that the team consumes within their application (including third-party APIs).Onus for third-party APIs is on enterprise developers, by Amy Reichert, SearchSoftwareQuality July 2014 API testing is used to determine whether APIs return the correct response (in the expected format) for a broad range of feasible requests, react properly to edge cases such as failures and unexpected/extreme inputs, deliver responses in an acceptable amount of time, and respond securely to potential security attacks. Service virtualization is used in conjunction with API testing to isolate the services under test as well as expand test environment access by simulating APIs/services that are not accessible for testing.Accelerate Development with Automated Testing, by Nathan Wilson, Gartner December 30, 2013 API testing commonly includes testing REST APIs or SOAP web services with JSON or XML message payloads being sent over HTTP, HTTPS, JMS, and MQ.A Guidance Framework for Designing a Great Web API, by Eric Knipp and Gary Olliffe , Gartner August 20, 2014 It can also include message formats such as SWIFT, FIX, EDI and similar fixed-length formats, CSV, ISO 8583 and Protocol Buffers being sent over transports/protocols such as TCP/IP, ISO 8583, MQTT, FIX, RMI, SMTP, TIBCO Rendezvous, and FIX.The Fight Against Brittle Scripts and Software Defects, by Adrian Bridgwater, Dr. Dobb's Journal October 26, 2011How Do We Learn Composite App Testing-Speak?, by Adrian Bridgwater, Dr. Dobb's Journal February 14, 2012 API testing, GUI testing, and test automation API Testing is recognised as being more suitable for test automation and continuous testing (especially the automation used with Agile software development and DevOps) than GUI testing. Reasons cited include: * System complexity: GUI tests can't sufficiently verify functional paths and back-end APIs/services associated with multitier architectures. APIs are considered the most stable interface to the system under test. * Short release cycles with fast feedback loops: Agile and DevOps teams working with short iterations and fast feedback loops find that GUI tests require considerable rework to keep pace with frequent change. Tests at the API layer are less brittle and easier to maintain. For these reasons, it is recommended that teams increase their level of API testing while decreasing their reliance on GUI testing. API testing is recommended for the vast majority of test automation efforts and as much edge testing as possible. GUI testing is then reserved for validating typical use cases at the system level, mobile testing, and usability testing. Types of API testing API testing typically involves the following practices: * Unit testing - Testing the functionality of individual operations. * Functional testing - Testing the functionality of broader scenarios, often using unit tests as building blocks for end-to-end tests. Includes test case definition, execution, validation, and regression testing. * Load testing - Validating functionality and performance under load, often by reusing functional test cases. * Runtime error detection - Monitoring an application the execution of automated or manual tests to expose problems such as race conditions, exceptions, and resource leaks. * Security testing - Includes penetration testing and fuzz testing as well as validating authentication, encryption, and access control. * Web UI testing - Performed as part of end-to-end integration tests that also cover APIs, enables teams to validate GUI items in the context of the larger transaction. * Interoperability testing - (SOAP only) Checking conformance to Web Services Interoperability profiles. * WS-* compliance testing - (SOAP only) Checking compliance to WS-* standards such as WS-Addressing, WS-Discovery, WS- Federation, WS-Policy, WS-Security, and WS-Trust. * Penetration testing - testing a computer system, network or Web application to find vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. * Fuzz-testing - massive amounts of purely random data, sometimes referred to as \\"noise\\" or \\"fuzz\\", is forcibly input into the system in order to attempt a forced crash, overflow, or other negative behavior.

There are two forms, Œ±-antiarin and Œ≤-antiarin.  Œ≤-Antiarin  Œ≤-Antiarin, a cardiac glycoside steroid, can be isolated from upas tree latex (Antiaris toxicaria). Its use ranges from medical use, such as hypertension treatment, to arrow poison application. It also proves to be more poisonous than curare, sporting a low LD50 of 0.1 mg/kg in most mammals. Antiaris toxicaria in Jardin Botanique de Kandy To date, Œ≤-antiarin has only been isolated from the upas tree by the scientist H. Kiliani in 1896; no synthetic synthesis has yet been achieved.  Symptoms of Œ≤-antiarin poisoning  Upon Œ≤-antiarin poisoning, when observed in animals such as frogs and small mammals, visible symptoms include muscle spasms ‚Äî particularly of the head and neck ‚Äî and excess defecation. Paralysis can also be presented before death. The primary physiological system affected is the cardiac muscle, though gastro-intestinal tissue has also been known to be severely affected by this type of poisoning. Convulsions and spasms are not immediate, especially when the chemical is too diluted in water. In animal tests, time of death resulted anywhere from 5‚Äì30 minutes after administration. When used as an arrow poison, beta-antiarin produces twitches in the target, which then become full convulsions, unconsciousness, and final death through cardiac arrest. =Toxicity of Œ≤-antiarin= During tests performed on frogs and mammals, it was found that the minimum lethal dose for an amphibian was 1/300th mg. For a 300-400 g guinea pig, this lethal dose increased to 0.75 mg. Lethal dose for felines is 0.094 mg/kg, using intravenous injection. Meanwhile, 1 mg will kill a dog.  Physiological systems affected/medical properties  Œ≤-Antiarin is administered to the body through injection. Once inside the body, the chemical will affect muscular and cardiac tissues. A heart attack occurs because beta- antiarin affects Na+K+-ATPase cardiac-muscle membrane activity. Sodium calcium pump However, the very effect that allows Œ≤-antiarin to be a poison also gives it medicinal properties. It limits the sodium ion (Na+) concentration by blocking the Na+ pump, which then promotes calcium ions (Ca2+) to increase in concentration in the extracellular cardiac muscle domain, therein permitting the heart to contract. The mechanism through which sodium and calcium ions are exchanged, known as the sodium-calcium exchanger, allows for the exchange of ions to occur at a rate of 3:1 respectively. The cardiac cell exhibits a positive potential during ventricular systole, becomes depolarized, and permits calcium ions to rush in by the sodium-calcium exchanger. From here, the contraction occurs when the calcium ions leave and the cell re-polarizes. If the dosage of cardiac glycoside (i.e. beta-antiarin) doubles, then the substance becomes a poison.  Cultural references  Four Dayak tribesmen in a warfare ritual The earliest known use of Œ≤-antiarin as an arrow poison was with the Li people in China, circa 581. Other cultures, such as the peoples of the Dayak tribe, Berusu, Punan, and Basap in Borneo, southeast Asia, have also used the sap of the upas tree for poisoned darts. Indigenous people would collect the sap in a bamboo fixture (or upas leaf if amount needed is small), then place over an open flame for a week. Extreme care was taken to make sure the sap does not boil over; to make sure the poison was not lost, small taste tests would be performed as the sap continues to be dehydrated. A sweet taste would indicate that the sugar arrangement (L-rhamnose) in beta-antiarin broke, thus ruining the potency of the poison and freeing the sugar into the sap. Final poisonous sap would be a dark black, metallic colour and have a bitter taste; this is usually achieved at the end of seven days. The sap can then be used to coat the arrow tips, and its potency continues to be effective for years as long as care is taken to make sure the tip is not re-exposed to heat. Even hardened, stored poison could still be lethal when reconstructed with the root sap of Derris elliptica, or strychnos, or snake poison. The arrows could be used for hunting as well as defense; if the tissue surrounding the arrowhead was cut off and the meat cooked, the poison's L-rhamnose sugar would break off, rendering it useless.

He was born in Switzerland and specialized in otorhinolaryngology. His most notable contribution to the field of voice was a textbook that he published with Dr. Gottfried E. Arnold. The textbook was originally published in German, however the second edition, published in 1965, was translated into English under the title: Voice-Speech-Language. Although the text was written over 40 years ago, the topics covered in the text are quite similar to those that would be covered in a contemporary voice textbook, which shows how much further along the study of phoniatry was compared to other subdivisions of Speech Language Pathology at the time. For example, topics covered in this text included: speech acoustics, observational methods, treatment of laryngeal electromyography, physiology of respiration and voice production, genetic factors in voice, development of voice throughout the lifespan, professional voice, voice therapy; pathology of the larynx, nodules, asymmetries, genetic defects of voice and laryngeal web, sulcus glottides, voice related endocrine problems, the effects of peripheral nerve lesions, the sympathetic nervous system; laryngeal myopathy, central lesions of the nervous system, laryngeal trauma, cordectomy, joint disorders, alaryngeal voice, vasomotor effects on vocal fold function, functional dysphonias, contact ulcers, ventricular voice, and psychogenic voice disorders. Luchsinger founded one of the first scholarly journals devoted to the study of voice, called the Folia Phoniatrica. He also founded the Swiss Society for Phoniatrics, Logopedics, and Audiology. Luchsinger published more than 120 research articles, ranging in topic from Cri Du Chat Syndrome to laryngeal surgery. He continued to be an active participant in the Speech Language Pathology community until his death in 1993. References D.Cooper.

It corrects the effect of agreement solely due to chance between clusterings, similar to the way the adjusted rand index corrects the Rand index. It is closely related to variation of information: when a similar adjustment is made to the VI index, it becomes equivalent to the AMI. The adjusted measure however is no longer metrical. Mutual information of two partitions Given a set S of N elements S=\\\\\\\\{s_1, s_2,\\\\ldots s_N\\\\\\\\}, consider two partitions of S, namely U=\\\\\\\\{U_1, U_2,\\\\ldots, U_R\\\\\\\\} with R clusters, and V=\\\\\\\\{V_1, V_2,\\\\ldots, V_C\\\\\\\\} with C clusters. It is presumed here that the partitions are so-called hard clusters; the partitions are pairwise disjoint: :U_i\\\\cap U_j = \\\\varnothing = V_i\\\\cap V_j for all i e j, and complete: :\\\\cup_{i=1}^RU_i=\\\\cup_{j=1}^C V_j=S The mutual information of cluster overlap between U and V can be summarized in the form of an RxC contingency table M=[n_{ij}]^{i=1 \\\\ldots R}_{j=1 \\\\ldots C}, where n_{ij} denotes the number of objects that are common to clusters U_i and V_j. That is, :n_{ij}=\\\\leftU_i\\\\cap V_j\\\\right Suppose an object is picked at random from S; the probability that the object falls into cluster U_i is: :P_U(i)=\\\\frac{U_i}{N} The entropy associated with the partitioning U is: :H(U)=-\\\\sum_{i=1}^R P_U(i)\\\\log P_U(i) H(U) is non-negative and takes the value 0 only when there is no uncertainty determining an object's cluster membership, i.e., when there is only one cluster. Similarly, the entropy of the clustering V can be calculated as: :H(V)=-\\\\sum_{j=1}^C P_V(j)\\\\log P_V(j) where P_V(j)={V_j}/{N}. The mutual information (MI) between two partitions: :MI(U,V)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^R \\\\sum_{j=1}^C P_{UV}(i,j)\\\\log \\\\frac{P_{UV}(i,j)}{P_U(i)P_V(j)} where P_{UV}(i,j) denotes the probability that a point belongs to both the cluster U_i in U and cluster V_j in V: :P_{UV}(i,j)=\\\\frac{U_i \\\\cap V_j}{N} MI is a non-negative quantity upper bounded by the entropies H(U) and H(V). It quantifies the information shared by the two clusterings and thus can be employed as a clustering similarity measure. Adjustment for chance Like the Rand index, the baseline value of mutual information between two random clusterings does not take on a constant value, and tends to be larger when the two partitions have a larger number of clusters (with a fixed number of set elements N). By adopting a hypergeometric model of randomness, it can be shown that the expected mutual information between two random clusterings is: :\\\\begin{align} E\\\\\\\\{MI(U,V)\\\\\\\\} = & \\\\sum_{i=1}^R \\\\sum_{j=1}^C \\\\sum_{n_{ij}=(a_i+b_j-N)^+}^{\\\\min(a_i, b_j)} \\\\frac{n_{ij}}{N} \\\\log \\\\left( \\\\frac{ N\\\\cdot n_{ij}}{a_i b_j}\\\\right) \\\\times  & \\\\frac{a_i!b_j!(N-a_i)!(N-b_j)!} {N!n_{ij}!(a_i-n_{ij})!(b_j-n_{ij})!(N-a_i- b_j+n_{ij})!}  \\\\end{align} where (a_i+b_j-N)^+ denotes \\\\max(1,a_i+b_j-N). The variables a_i and b_j are partial sums of the contingency table; that is, :a_i=\\\\sum_{j=1}^Cn_{ij} and :b_j=\\\\sum_{i=1}^Rn_{ij} The adjusted measure for the mutual information may then be defined to be: : AMI(U,V)= \\\\frac{MI(U,V)-E\\\\\\\\{MI(U,V)\\\\\\\\}} {\\\\max{\\\\\\\\{H(U),H(V)\\\\\\\\}}-E\\\\\\\\{MI(U,V)\\\\\\\\}} . The AMI takes a value of 1 when the two partitions are identical and 0 when the MI between two partitions equals the value expected due to chance alone.
