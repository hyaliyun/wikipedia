In the mixed council of 798, Charlemagne proclaimed a capitulary of eighty-one chapters, largely a repetition of earlier ecclesiastical legislation, that was accepted by the clergy and acquired canonical authority. At the council of 799, after a discussion of six days Felix (bishop of Urgell) in Spain, avowed himself overcome by Alcuin and withdrew his theory of Adoptionism. At the council held in 809, the Frankish Church adopted the filioque addition in the Creed (which contributed to the East‚ÄìWest Schism), although Pope Leo III refused to recognize it as valid (and the Church of Rome did not accept this addition until 1014). In the Synods of Aachen (816‚Äì819), clerical and monastic discipline was the chief issue. The council of 816 established the Rule of Aix which was made obligatory on all establishments of canons and canonesses. The later councils imposed a new revision of the Rule of Saint Benedict on the monks of the Benedictine Order by Benedict of Aniane. A list of monasteries and the services to the crown that they owed following these councils can be found in the Notitia de servitio monasteriorum. The synod of 836 was largely attended and devoted itself to the restoration of ecclesiastical discipline that had been affected by the civil wars between Louis the Pious and his sons. From 860 to 862 three councils were occupied with the question of the divorce of King Lothair II from his wife, Teutberga. In 1166 took place the schismatic council, approved by the Antipope Paschal III, in which was decreed the canonization of Charlemagne, that was solemnly celebrated 29 December of that year.

In 1285, a court slave freed by Mari Djata, the founder of the Mali Empire, who had also served as a general, usurped the throne of the Mali Empire. In the 14th century (possibly also earlier and later) the Tuareg-controlled kingdom of Takedda, west of the A√Ør Massif, played a prominent role in long-distance trade, notably owing to the importance of its copper mines. Takedda was visited by Ibn Battuta on his return trip from the Mali Empire in 1353. Evidence of copperworking have been found at the site dating to the first millennium BC. The French archeologist, Danilo Gr√©b√©nart, has excavated the site and has studied the significance of this prehistoric non-ferrous metal industry.. The reign of Mansa Sakoura (also spelt Sakura) appears to have been beneficial despite the political shake-up. He added the first conquests to Mali since the reign of Ouali including the former Wagadou provinces of Tekrour and Diara. His conquests did not stop at the boundaries of Wagadou however. He campaigned into Senegal and conquered the Wolof province of Dyolof then took the army east to subjugate the copper producing area of Takedda. NotesReferences *. First published in 1986, . *.

History The London and Southampton Railway (L&SR;) was opened in stages. Most of the portion south of was opened on 10 June 1839, to a temporary terminus in Southampton called Northam Road. Not long before the opening, on 4 June 1839, the L&SR; was renamed the London and South Western Railway (LSWR). The temporary station was closed when the line was completed and the permanent was opened on 11 May 1840. The need to open a temporary station at Northam Road arose because of a dispute during construction of the line. There was a disagreement between the L&SR; and the Northam Bridge Company (NBC), owners of the Northam Bridge, concerning how the railway would cross Northam Road, which connected the bridge with the centre of Southampton. The plans for the railway specified that there would be a level crossing, but the NBC requested that the Northam Road be carried over the railway on a bridge. The NBC began legal proceedings on 13 March 1839, and the L&SR; took legal advice which recommended that the road bridge not be built, but even so the L&SR; acceded to the NBC's demands and built the bridge over the railway. During the 1860s, Northam residents campaigned for a local intermediate station, but the LSWR was not in favour because Northam would be only a short distance away from the main terminus, which would become known as Southampton Terminus. Nevertheless, a site was investigated between, what is now, Mount Pleasant level crossing and the current SWR train depot. Eventually the station was built on the south side of Northam Road bridge, not far from where the temporary terminus once stood. The new Northam station opened on 1 December 1872. It was built by a company called Joseph Bull & Sons, which at the time had its own tramway system from its premises at Belvidere Wharf on the River Itchen to areas north of the location. As well as building Northam railway station, the company was associated with much of the early railway construction in Southampton and near-by areas. When Northam opened, only tickets to depart could be bought at the station. Passengers travelling to Northam had to buy tickets to Southampton Terminus, with Northam acting as a ticket platform. The station never needed any goods facilities or sidings due to its close proximity to Southampton Terminus, which handled all the goods traffic in Southampton. Northam station was situated at the base of the triangle formed by the northern and southern junctions leading to the line to Southampton Central. Northam only served trains to and from Southampton Terminus. The station offices on the up line to London were made out of wood and each platform could be accessed only by steps from Northam Road bridge. Northam also had an engine shed, which was 14 tracks wide but short in length, with room for only two locomotives under cover. It opened in October 1840, but closed on 1 January 1903 when Eastleigh Railway depot was opened. With traffic booming for both Northam and Southampton Terminus in the early 1900s, the bridge crossing the line at the station was rebuilt in 1908. Only one entrance was retained, but a new footbridge connecting the platforms was provided, as well as new station buildings. Northam station closed on 5 September 1966. By the 1960s, with most traffic now going to Southampton Central, business at Northam and Southampton Terminus was in decline. Both stations were closed prior to electrification of the main line in 1967. Northam station was demolished in 1969 and no traces remain of it. However the former up line still runs through the site of the station and is used for freight trains going to the docks. The down lines which ran through Northam are now connected to the nearby Siemens Mobility train care depot for South Western Railway. Future Station A few campaigns have been launched to reopen Northam station next door to St Mary's stadium to serve nearby local residents and allow football charter trains to stop outside St Mary's stadium which is home to the local football team Southampton FC. South West Trains showed no interest in reopening either Northam or Southampton Terminus, claiming that the South Western Main Line is already full with both passenger and freight trains and Northam Junction is also extremely busy. A ¬£10 million pound plan was put forward in 1999 to reopen Southampton Terminus and Northam Station, which was to have been controlled by Anglia Railways, their plans included building a new rail-link using the current remaining track by St. Marys Stadium and as far as the Waterfront, which is now safe guarded by Southampton City Council for future rail links. This would have allowed trains to go from Southampton Waterfront to East Anglia without the need to change at London. It was also hoped it would reduce the traffic around Southampton with a local commuter line linking the Waterfront to Romsey, Halterworth and Chandler's Ford, the plan failed to come about for reasons unknown. On the run up to the 2018 local election, the local Conservative Party pledged to fund a report into the feasibility of reopening the station if they win, it was hoped that reopening the link would encourage more use of public transport and reduce air pollution.

Plot While travelling through Utah, Jack Carter picks up a hitchhiker, but kicks him out after a few minutes due to the man hitting on him. Hours later, Jack stops in a secluded area, and begins digging a grave for the woman he had bound and gagged in the back of his pickup truck. Four women (Melinda, Patty, Kristina, and Denise) from Colorado Springs are driving through the area on their way to a nurse's conference in Las Vegas. Spotting Jack hitchhiking, the quartet pick him up, and soon after experience car trouble, forcing them to stop at a roadside motel. The manager tells the group that the nearest service station does not open until the morning, so they elect to stay. During the night, Jack shows interest in Melinda, and has rough sex with Kristina, who has a fianc√©. In the morning, the mechanic arrives, and is shot to death by Jack after the two travel to Jack's abandoned truck. Jack returns to the motel, where he murders the manager and takes the women captive after drugging them. Jack gives a misogynistic speech, and implies he is doing this due to having been \\"betrayed\\" by his girlfriend or wife. While sexually assaulting Denise and Melinda, Jack is knocked out by the latter, who tries to escape with her friends. The vehicles will either not work, or are missing their keys, so the women decide to kill Jack, who awakens while being attacked, and fatally shoots Kristina. The others are recaptured, and while Jack is binding Melinda (who he has developed a fondness for, and regards as \\"special\\") a married couple arrives, looking for a room. After giving the couple a room, Jack kills the husband when he goes to investigate noises coming from the room Melinda and the others are in. Jack places the man's wife, Susan, with the other captives, and shoots Patty in the head after Denise goes on an insult-laden rant against him. As Jack sleeps, Susan uses her cellphone to repeatedly dial 911, prompting a pair of police officers to stop by in the morning. Jack gets into a shootout with the officers, who he kills while Melinda, Denise, and Susan drive off in their patrol car. A chase ensues, during which Susan is shot in the head, and Jack is run over. Weeks later, Denise visits Melinda, and it is revealed that Jack had survived, and is being tried in Wyoming, where he murdered at least two women. That night, Jack, who had escaped from custody and hitchhiked his way to Colorado, breaks into Melinda's home, and ties her husband to a chair. Jack declares his love for Melinda, who responds by rejecting him, shooting him in the stomach, and then in the face.

History Leeds Akademiks were founded in 2003 by students from the three Universities of Leeds to provide a pathway from student rugby league to open age amateur rugby league. They were admitted into the North East Division of the Rugby League Conference in 2003, playing out of West Park Bramhope RUFC. This was to pave the way for a huge influx of truly heartland teams the following season, drastically changing the face of the Conference. Leeds won the North East Division in 2003 and the newly formed Yorkshire Division in 2004. Leeds Akademiks had to change their moniker to Akkies due to a legal challenge from an American clothing brand named Akademik in 2005. The newly renamed Leeds Akkies joined the newly created Central Premier Division which they won. Leeds Akkies were defeated by the Bridgend Blue Bulls in the Grand Final of the Harry Jepson Trophy. In 2007 the club joined the newly renamed RLC National Division and fielded three open age teams during a season at Weetwood, whilst redevelopment work took place at West Park. The club ended the season a tour to Barcelona - becoming the first British side to face local opposition on Spanish soil when they defeated a Catalan Universities XIII in Girona. The Akkies launched its first women's team in 2008 whilst the men's team dropped to the Premier North. The club again fielded men's sides in the RLC Yorkshire Premier and Regional divisions in 2009. The club's women's side came within points difference of claiming the WRLC Yorkshire minor premiership and a place in the national play-offs. Leeds Mongrels RL were formed in 2009 by Leeds Akkies club member Carl Brown as an opportunity to play rugby league at a social level. They became part of the Akkies in 2010. In 2010 the club ended its seven-year association with West Park Leeds RUFC in order to accept an invitation to join the Old Modernians Association in Cookridge, north-west Leeds. Akkies 2016 went unbeaten at home all season and had 2 narrow away losses which crowned them champions with very impressive team coached by dr charanjit Sandhu of Wortley.

Its main aim is to promote Conservative and Unionist principles on campus and to provide a safe-space for Conservative debate. History Its original name was the Peel Club, and was formed after Robert Peel's 1836 election as Rector of Glasgow University. In 1852 it changed its name to Glasgow University Conservative Club, which it remained for 120 years, renaming itself Glasgow University Conservative Association in 1972.Listing of the society's archival holdings on the University of Glasgow Archives Hub A particular aim of the club, as stated in the 1972 Constitution, was to preserve the dignity of the Rectorial Chair of the University by promoting prominent Conservatives to occupy the position.

Three of the four (Samsun, Yarhisar and Basra) were built by C A de la Gironde at Bordeaux, while Tasoz was built by Schneider at Nantes. These ships suffered from mechanical problems due to poor maintenance and played little part in World War I. It was estimated that none could exceed in 1915. The Yarhisar was sunk in 1915 and the three surviving ships were scrapped in 1949. Yarhisar was under the command of Lt. Cdr.

Allegheny County is the second most populous county in Pennsylvania (1.3 million in 1996), following Philadelphia County. The county seat is Pittsburgh. The county forms the nucleus of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area, Pittsburgh DMA, and Pittsburgh Tri-state area. He is the author of the horror novel The Demon of Brownsville Road. Career The son of a retired military officer, Cranmer graduated from Brentwood High School in 1974 and received a bachelor of science degree in secondary education and history from Duquesne University in 1978. After service as a United States Army officer where one of his assignments was as a company commander with the 101st Airborne Division, he returned home and was elected to Brentwood Council in 1991. Bob Cranmer, Commanding Officer, Company B, 311th M.I. Battalion (CEWI), 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), 1982. Brentwood Towne Square In 1991 Cranmer ran for a seat on Brentwood council stating that he would bring a new grocery store to the community. But after his election Cranmer found his campaign promise was easier said than done when grocery chains he contacted disparaged the condition of the current shopping center and the topography of the land where it sat. Understanding that the Brentwood-Whitehall Shopping Center was in an advanced state of deterioration (and had fallen into bankruptcy), he initiated a plan to create an economic development corporation (Brentwood Economic Development Corporation, later expanded and renamed Economic Development South) to work with developers in addressing the commercial needs of Brentwood (specifically) and later expanded to serve other communities in the South Hills of Allegheny County. Working with Allegheny County (Cranmer, later as a county commissioner), Kappa Properties, and Giant Eagle this corporation undertook a development plan to demolish and rebuild this primary business district, eventually creating a $32 million development which became known as \\"Brentwood Towne Square or Center\\". Brentwood vs. TCI Cable He gained the attention of the national media in 1993 when he challenged the operating practices of the media giant TCI Cable. The firm, which had contracted with Brentwood to provide cable television services, added without notice or approval two explicitly adult (pay-per-view) channels, Playboy TV and Spice Networks, and was done to test market the service. When a subscriber television was turned on it would automatically \\"default\\" to one of the adult channels, each being lightly scrambled but still providing full uncensored audio. These \\"mechanical\\" features made contact with the channels unavoidable, making children vulnerable to programming designed explicitly for adult viewers. Cranmer claimed that this was done as a ploy to entice viewers to subscribe while subjecting all viewers to the adult content, including children. He also based his objections on an existing borough ordnance that prohibited the sale of sexually explicit magazines, videos, or performances. In signing a contract with the borough, TCI had agreed to abide by all borough laws and regulations and that they were now violating the ordnance by providing \\"home delivery service\\" of pornographic material. Brentwood borough and TCI eventually came to an out-of-court agreement in which the channels would be further scrambled and blocked entirely upon request of the subscriber. Teresa Heinz ‚Äì Rick Santorum controversy In 1994, he was elected chairman of the Republican Party of Allegheny County. In October of that year Cranmer again gained the national spotlight when Teresa Heinz, the wife of the late Senator John Heinz, a Republican, and later wife of presidential candidate John Kerry, publicly endorsed Democratic incumbent Senator Harris Wofford, who had been appointed to the seat by Governor Bob Casey following her husband's death. She called the Republican candidate, Congressman Rick Santorum, \\"Forrest Gump with an attitude\\" and labeled him much too conservative for Pennsylvania. The same day that her endorsement made the Pennsylvania newspapers Cranmer issued a press release which included a letter from him to Mrs. Heinz (who was, at that time, a registered Republican), asking her to change her voter registration to the Democratic Party; he also included a voter registration form. Cranmer's letter helped him gain notoriety, as it was seen as emblematic of the betrayal felt by State Republicans. Jonny Gammage incident In 1995 during his campaign for county commissioner, two Brentwood Police officers were involved in an incident during which a young black man named Jonny Gammage of Syracuse, New York, was killed during a routine traffic stop. Gammage was the cousin of Ray Seals, a player for the Pittsburgh Steelers football team. The controversy surrounding the death made the national news and racial tension rose to a fever pitch in Pittsburgh. Cranmer, who had been at odds with the Brentwood police as a councilman, denounced the police conduct and when pressured leveled accusations that Brentwood had a history racist incidents. He and his family were castigated by members of the community and contemplated moving but eventually did not. After several trials and mistrials, all of the police officers were eventually acquitted in the case. Many in the community never forgave Cranmer for his statements. Allegheny County Commissioner Cranmer went on to be elected County Commissioner in November 1995 in a landmark election and was thought to be a firebrand conservative. Being a member of the first Republican majority in Allegheny County government since the Great Depression, Cranmer subsequently split with his Republican running mate Larry Dunn over major differences concerning the managing of the county government, and formed a close governing alliance with Democrat commissioner Mike Dawida. He was heralded as a \\"traitor\\" to Republicans by commissioner Dunn, who subsequently (unlike Cranmer), switched parties and became a registered Democrat to run for county controller in 2003. In summary, the Post-Gazette stated \\"that despite the political suicide he brought upon himself, this was the turning point that helped the county recover from earlier mistakes\\". As a commissioner he made significant changes to county government, reducing county taxes by 20 percent, reducing county personnel by 18%, merging twenty-eight county departments into six, creating the position of County Manager, an integrated county 9-1-1 system, and forming a joint city/county economic development organization. The economic development organization is most notable for the coordination and construction of The Waterfront business/commercial/residential development with Continental Real Estate- Development, on the former site of the United States Steel Homestead Works. New County Government and Legacy He led an effort to establish home rule in Allegheny County, which created the position of County Executive and County Council after coming to the conclusion that a new structure of government was needed. This initiative was based upon a study set into motion by former county commissioners Tom Foerster and Pete Flaherty in 1995. They had established a committee chaired by the then Chancellor of Duquesne University, John E. Murray Jr. called \\"ComPAC 21\\", (The Committee to Prepare Allegheny County for the 21st Century). Their report laid the plan for a completely new organizational structure of county government. He also initiated the creation of the Allegheny County Airport Authority to manage the Pittsburgh International Airport in a more effective, professional manner. During their administration Mike Dawida and Bob Cranmer also oversaw the rehabilitation and restoration of the famed Henry Hobson Richardson Allegheny County Jail designed in the late 1800s. The vacant and deteriorating structure was converted to house the new combined home of the juvenile and adult family sections of Allegheny County Common Pleas Court. The $46 million spent on the renovation project was nearly 23 times the original cost of both of the Richardsonian Romanesque masterpieces, the jail and county courthouse. Cranmer and Mike Dawida worked cooperatively to achieve their city-county goals, and as the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette put it: \\"The partnership held strong through decisions that got county government back on track.\\" L-R, Mike Dawida ‚Äì Tom Murphy ‚Äì Bob Cranmer, 1999. The combined leadership of Cranmer, Dawida, and Mayor Tom Murphy (Thomas J. Murphy Jr.) led to a building boom in Pittsburgh dubbed \\"Renaissance III\\" that was a catalyst for how the city would be viewed a decade later when it was selected to host the 2009 G-20 summit, led by President Barack Obama. The Post-Gazette commented in 1998 that Allegheny County Commissioners Bob Cranmer and Mike Dawida understand the importance of a strong urban core and, through their partnership, have helped the mayor find ways to do what lesser leadership would considerable unthinkable. It is a meeting of such focused minds and willing spirits that stands to take Pittsburgh into a new era. Call it Renaissance III or call it just a better place to live, this is the blueprint of a renewable city that more people will be proud to call home.\\" Cranmer's tenure in office had an impact upon the size, structure, and cost of county government. The Post-Gazette would later sum up his time in office with the following when he announced that he would not seek reelection: \\"By thinning the field and working toward the day when Republicans have a single alternative to the policies of ill-conceived tax cuts, reactionary thinking and government-as-usual, Commissioner Cranmer has made the ultimate political sacrifice. If that is the mark of a citizen- lawmaker ‚Äì to be honest, to spurn patronage, to reform the public sector and then get out ‚Äì this commissioner has been one such leader. Allegheny County could use a few more Bob Cranmers.\\" He was followed in office by Jim Roddey, the first Allegheny County Executive. Papers and associated historical records concerning Cranmer's term in office are filed at the Heinz History Center, (archival storage) in Pittsburgh. The following comments were made upon his departure from office: (I) found Cranmer to be \\"very forthright.\\" \\"I was impressed with his integrity. I just saw him develop his knowledge. You always felt that you get an honest answer from him.\\" Moe Coleman, Retired director of the Institute for Politics at the University of Pittsburgh \\"A fascinating political figure who contravened earlier predictions. When he was first elected, people thought he would be a rabble-rousing, right-wing Christian Coalition partisan and he turned out to be anything but. He proved to be a very complicated ‚Äì almost enigmatic ‚Äì political figure. He's clearly someone who listened to his own drummer.\\" Jon Delano, Democrat political analyst Though Cranmer's decision to split from Dunn probably cost him his political future, Green said he should get credit for it. \\"It was a very difficult personal decision but he did it because it was right for the county.\\" Bill Green, Republican political consultant He worked for several firms after leaving office (in government relations) and in July 2009 he established \\"Cranmer Consultants\\", a government and legislative affairs company. In 2000, Cranmer was inducted into the Sons of the American Revolution after he traced his lineage back to Noadiah Cranmer who fought in the American Revolutionary War, and served as president of the Pittsburgh chapter for two years. Plan B The Pittsburgh Steelers and the Pittsburgh Pirates sports teams shared Three Rivers Stadium from 1970 to 2000. After discussions over the Pittsburgh Pirates building a full-time baseball park, a proposal was made to renovate Three Rivers Stadium into a full-time football facility. Though this met with negative reaction from Steelers ownership, the proposal was used as a \\"fallback position\\" that would be used if discussions for a new stadium failed. Steelers ownership stated that failing to build a new stadium would hurt the franchise's chances of signing players who might opt to sign with other teams, such as the other four teams in the Steelers division who had all recently built new football-only stadiums. Originally, a ten-county half percent sales tax increase was proposed by the Allegheny Conference on Community Development to fund three projects: Heinz Field, PNC Park, and a major expansion of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, along with other regional public works infrastructure improvements in all ten counties. After the rejection of this proposal in a referendum, Cranmer, Mike Dawida and Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy developed Plan B which involved no \\"new\\" taxation. The source of the funding would be the Allegheny County Regional Asset District which already collected a one percent sales tax in Allegheny County. The county commissioners were required to be involved if this revenue was to be used for the projects. Thus Cranmer became a central figure to the plan's formulation and success. Similarly controversial, the alternative proposal was labeled Scam B by opponents. The Steelers' pledge toward the new stadium was criticized for being too little, even after it was raised from $50 million to $76.5 million. Other local government members criticized the $281 million of public money allocated for Plan B. The lone Republican, Cranmer's support was seen as key for the plan to succeed. He had initially stated that he would not use tax money to build stadiums but later clarified his position to mean revenue collected from \\"property taxes\\". This was due to his discovery that a portion of the Regional Asset District Tax was specifically designated for the \\"construction and maintenance\\" of sports facilities. However, he was determined to put together the best deal possible and led the final negotiations with the Steelers personally.\\"It was time to make a deal. If it wasn't made then, it probably wouldn't have gotten done. When you make a compromise, there are things you want and things you don't get,\\" Art Rooney (Art Rooney II) of the Steelers said. Governor Tom Ridge then went to work in Harrisburg personally lobbying the legislature to approve the last remaining critical component. The agreement involved one third funding by the state and required an increase in the state's debt ceiling to fund its portion of the deal. After great controversy and raucous debate he succeeded. The plan never would have been completed without the personal efforts and involvement of the governor. The plan met with criticism and opposition from Fred Baker, a member of the Regional Asset District Board. When Baker made clear his opposition to the plan, Cranmer asked for his resignation. After resigning, Baker ran for a seat on the new County Council to continue opposing Cranmer's plans. One member of the Allegheny Regional Asset District board called the use of tax dollars \\"corporate welfare\\". The plan, totaling $809 million, was approved by the Allegheny Regional Asset District board on July 9, 1998, with $233 million allotted for Heinz Field. Shortly after Plan B was approved, the Steelers and the Pirates signed leases to stay in the city until at least 2031. The total cost of Heinz Field was $281 million, with the Pittsburgh Steelers paying for all costs over the original budgeted amount. Due to his support for Plan B his popularity with Republican voters dropped significantly and he announced in early 1999 that he would not run for the newly created position of county executive. He was both praised and reviled for his role in Plan B with much of his other work going unnoticed by the general electorate. Many Republicans also would not forgive him for working cooperatively with the Democrats. In 1999 Cranmer did not agree to a similar deal with the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey team which guaranteed that a funding plan would be in place by 2002 to build a new hockey arena. He maintained that there would be no money to support such a financial plan without a tax increase and was against committing the future government to such a financial responsibility. 2003 arrest On September 14, 2003, police were called to Cranmer's home in Brentwood at 11:30 pm by Cranmer's 14-year-old son Charles, where Cranmer was arrested after a dispute with his 19-year-old son Robert Cranmer Jr. In an affidavit one arresting officer alleged that his son was \\"in a state of semiconsciousness to the degree that he could not reply to my questioning\\", and Cranmer admitted at the time to having punched his son in the face. His son was examined by paramedics and taken to Jefferson Memorial Hospital, and Cranmer was charged with simple assault, arraigned in Night Court by Senior District Justice Leonard Boehm and released on his own recognizance the following morning from the Allegheny County Jail. Cranmer's wife Lesa and son Charles gave statements to police alleging that Cranmer had assaulted his son, following a dispute over the use of Cranmer's bathroom by his son Robert. Cranmer asserted that his actions were in self-defense, and that his son suffered from bipolar disorder which caused him to become violent. In November 2003 Cranmer's court hearing on the assault charges were postponed for thirty days by the District Justice hearing the case, after the court was told that Cranmer and his family were undergoing counselling. The charges were later dropped. Lawsuits In 1998 former investigator in the county public defender's office Geary M. Conley sued Cranmer, his colleague Larry Dunn, the Allegheny County Solicitor and the Acting Public Defender, alleging that he was fired in 1996 for political reasons. The Solicitor and the Acting Public Defender were replaced later (in 1996) as well. In 2009, it was reported that Cranmer was expected to testify in a lawsuit against the county by former county recreation manager Mike Diehl. The lawsuit claimed that Cranmer fired Diehl for political reasons. In February 2009 Cranmer testified at great length that Diehl was dismissed specifically for his mismanagement, in that county employees were living in county-owned homes at reduced rent rates or without paying any rent at all (as officially reported by the office of the Allegheny County Controller). An audit by the county controller found that the county was owed at least $39,000 in rental payments and late-payment penalties. Cranmer ordered that Diehl (a 25-year county employee) and the three employees who were living in the houses be dismissed as a result. Despite Cranmer's testimony that his action was in no way related to Diehl's political affiliation the jury awarded Diehl $144,000 in compensatory damages for emotional distress, embarrassment, harm to his reputation and humiliation. Photographer After leaving office Cranmer set out to record in pictures what he called \\"the amazingly unique scenery and architecture of Allegheny County.\\" He compiled these photos into a book which he titled \\"The World through a Pittsburgh lens\\" in 2009. Author After leaving political office Cranmer wrote numerous op-ed articles and one historical research piece about George Washington in Western Pennsylvania. In 2014 he published a horror novel titled The Demon of Brownsville Road.

Born in Arkwright, Ontario, Woodside attended school at Owen Sound and Prince Arthur's Landing (now part of Thunder Bay). From 1878-1880 he worked for the Canadian Pacific Railway at the beginning of its great westwards expansion. Between 1880 and 1898 Woodside ran a number of businesses in Portage la Prairie, including a newspaper, the Manitoba Liberal. He served in the Canadian militia during the North-West Rebellion of 1885. Photo by Henry Joseph Woodside of crowd assembled at Dawson Post Office, Yukon 1899 In 1898 he relocated to the Yukon at the height of the Klondike Gold Rush and soon after was serving as managing editor of the Yukon Sun. He resigned from the paper in 1901 and was appointed Census Commissioner for the Yukon Territory. His photographs from this period provide a considerable portion of the recorded visual history of the Gold Rush. While there Woodside befriended Robert Henderson and spent considerable effort, through his newspaper and Canadian government contacts, in getting Henderson (a Canadian) recognised as the authentic discoverer of gold in the Klondike. In 1901-1902 Woodside joined the 2nd Regiment, Canadian Mounted Rifles, a six- squadron regiment of 901 officers and men and saw action in South Africa during the Boer War, earning the rank of major. In 1906 he was hired as city manager for the Imperial Guarantee and Accident Company in Ottawa. He served again with the rank of colonel in World War I in the 5th Regiment, Canadian Mounted Rifles, and was wounded in France in May 1916. Woodside's great-nephew Willson Woodside later gained fame within Canada as a war correspondent for the CBC during World War II.

He went on to play for Bristol RFC and was a stalwart of the team during the 1980s where he was also known by the nickname \\"Corky\\". He was particularly known for his extremely long pass which was used to great effect by Bristol. Harding would pass from a scrum straight to the full back which was intended to leave the opposing fullback flat-footed, allowing a two on one with the opposing wing. Whilst at Bristol he was part of the side who won the 1982‚Äì83 John Player Cup Final at Twickenham Harding's first cap for England came on Saturday, 5 January 1985 when England played Romania at Twickenham. The match was won by England 22-15. After that match, the position of scrum-half was contested by Harding, Richard Hill and Nigel Melville. Harding gained two more caps in 1985 against France and Scotland at Twickenham both in the Five Nations. In the France game Harding is remembered for his tackle on Patrick Esteve when he knocked the ball out of his hands over the try line. In 1986 he was not capped but returned to the team in 1987 when he was picked to replace the dropped Richard Hill following disciplinary action against the latter following the 1984 England-Wales match in Cardiff on 7 March. Harding played in the final Five Nations match against Scotland and found himself as first choice for the first Rugby World Cup in 1987.

It was raced from 1989 until 1991 in IMSA's premier sports-car racing category, the GTP (Grand Touring Prototype) division. The design was also sometimes called the Eagle MkII. Background From 1983 until 1988, Dan Gurney's team entered cars in the IMSA GTO and GTU divisions, with Toyota Celicas as the basis for their cars. After claiming the driver's and constructors' championships in the GTO division in 1987 with driver Chris Cord, and a third place in the division the following year, the AAR team switched to the IMSA GTP division for 1989. The team used two types of cars; the other chassis was a TOM'S Toyota 88C car (an FIA Group C-based car). Both were powered by a turbocharged, 2.1-liter inline-4 engine producing approximately 600 horsepower, which was similar to the engines AAR used in their IMSA GTO and GTU cars. The \\"Eagle\\" marque was used by Dan Gurney's AAR team to denote their racing cars, the \\"HF\\" comes from the initials of the designers' surnames, Hopkins and Fujimori, and 89 from the two-digit year of its initial competition. Four chassis were constructed, and two were modified in 1990 and reclassified as HF90. History The car made its debut at the 1989 IMSA Miami GTP race (car #99), but retired from the event with an engine timing belt malfunction. The team concentrated its efforts on the #98 car; AAR would not enter the HF89 until the Lime Rock GTP race. The car then completed its first race with a 5th-place finish at the following event at the Mid-Ohio GTP race. The HF89 did not finish any other races that season. By 1990, the Eagle HF89 replaced the 88C, and chalked up its first win at the 1990 IMSA Topeka GTP event, with Juan Manuel Fangio II driving. The team followed up with three more wins: Sears Point, as well as temporary street course races at San Antonio and Del Mar. While the team experienced some success in 1989 and 1990 with the HF89 and HF90 evolution, the chassis had a very small margin for setup error - in the words of driver Juan Manuel Fangio II, \\"When were in the window, the car was good in every way, but out of the window, the car was not right at all.\\"Martin, J.A. & Fuller, M.J. Inside IMSA's Legendary GTP Race Cars: The Prototype Experience, Motorbooks, 2008. This led the team to prepare a clean-sheet design for 1991 - the Eagle MkIII. In 1991, the HF89 won its final IMSA GTP race with Fangio driving, at the IMSA Camel Continental VIII at Watkins Glen. At the following GTP race at Laguna Seca, the Eagle MkIII made its race debut with AAR, which would eventually replace the Eagle HF89. The final race for the Eagle HF89 was at the IMSA GT race at Portland, where it finished in third place.

HistoryThe old lights= Left to right: Hurst Castle, old Low Lighthouse, old High Lighthouse (1840) The original lighthouse was the Hurst Tower, sited to the south west of the old Hurst Castle and lit for the first time on 29 September 1786.Lighthouses , hurstcastle.co.uk, retrieved 18 April 2012 Richard Jupp was the architect and Joseph Huddart supervised and directed its construction, which was undertaken at the same time as the erection of two other lights nearby: one on St Catherine's Down and the other on the clifftop above The Needles (it being envisaged that the three would be used in conjunction). The red, brick-built Hurst Tower displayed a fixed white light, but the north-west part of the lantern was 'darkened' to prevent it confusing vessels navigating further along the coast to the west. The Hurst Tower light was found to be obscured behind the Needles from certain directions; consequently, in 1812, this tower was supplemented by the High Lighthouse, a new tower at a higher level. The High Lighthouse, which was designed by Daniel Alexander, was a red, brick-built elliptical tower of an unusual and striking conical design. The two towers together functioned as leading lights for vessels approaching through the Needles Channel; both were equipped with three Argand lamps and reflectors (those in the Low Lighthouse were shown from a lower window in the tower, while a separate lamp in the lantern room above was angled in the opposite direction, to guide vessels navigating along The Solent). Each tower had been built with a keeper's cottage attached. =The new lights= In light of the expansion of the Castle between 1865 and 1873, it proved necessary to replace the two lighthouses. In 1865, a new Low Light was built: a white circular granite tower with a red lantern, which was attached to the new curtain wall of the castle; then, in 1867, a new High Light was built to designs by James Douglass: a freestanding 26 metre tower (which, in order to maintain the transit in relation to the channel, was positioned 15 metres to the east of the old High Light). Only the top of the Low Light was visible, but a red screen was positioned outside the walls of the fort as a day-mark, so as to make the tower look 'apparently complete' when the lighthouses were in line. The lights displayed were similar to those of the old towers, but the light directed up the Solent now shone from the High rather than the Low lighthouse. In the 1890s the High Light was provided with a complex new array of fixed first-order Fresnel lenses, together with a Douglass-designed six-wick lamp. According to contemporary plans, displayed in the nearby museum in the castle, the 'new' lenses were in fact old lenses reused from elsewhere: one panel 'taken from the first order dioptric apparatus formerly used at St Catherine's' and one 'taken from the central portion of the old Bishop's Rock apparatus',Photograph of diagrams from the ALK Museum in Hurst Castle both of which had been replaced a few years earlier. (Three sets of upper prisms were also re-used from St Catherine's.) One panel was positioned on the south-west side of the lamp and aligned with the Low Light to provide the transit guiding passage through the Needles Channel; the other was positioned on the east side of the lamp to guide vessels approaching via The Solent, with a red sector in addition marking a hazard, Solent Banks. In the intervening arc (i.e. between the outer Needles Rock and Sconce Point) the faint light of the naked flame of the lamp was left visible (at a later date a much smaller optic was incorporated to cover this arc). Together with the dioptric array, a complex occulting mechanism was installed, which eclipsed the light for two seconds every ten seconds whilst maintaining a fixed light over the arc of the transit with the Low Light. The Low Lights of 1911 (left) and 1865 (right) within the west wing of Hurst Castle. By 1911, shifting sandbanks had left the Low Light out of line with the channel. It was therefore replaced with a red square metal tower, mounted on steel joists alongside the castle wall to enable it to be moved laterally so as to adjust to future changes. It too was fitted with a first-order lens.\\"Lighthouse\\" in Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th edition, volume 15. In 1923 both lights were automated with the installation of an acetylene lamp controlled by a sun valve, fuelled from an adjacent producer plant. (The producer plant, which generated the gas using rainwater and calcium carbide, was decommissioned in 1968; stores of bottled gas were subsequently provided by Trinity House vessels.) Electric power was provided at the lighthouse in 1997. Due to increased use of the shipping lanes, a high-intensity sector light (designed to be seen day and night) was installed in one of the lower seaward-facing windows of the High Lighthouse, adjustable in case of further shifts in the sandbanks and using white, red and green light to mark with precision the narrow passage between the Needles and the Shingles Bank. This removed the need for a leading light, and the Low Light was therefore decommissioned that same year. Present day The High Lighthouse is still working today, having been converted from acetylene to electric power in 1997. In addition to the high-intensity sector light, the old dioptric apparatus, with its different focal lengths and red sector, remains in use in the lantern. Now known simply as Hurst Point Lighthouse, the tower is open for visitors but cannot be reached by car; access is by foot or boat only. The decommissioned acetylene producers have been preserved in situ and the old acetylene burner array is displayed at the base of the tower.

Page and released by J. W. Randolph Publishers of Richmond, Virginia.  Overview  Uncle Robin is one of several examples of the pro-slavery anti- Tom or plantation literature genre that emerged in the Southern United States. They were written in response to the publication of the bestselling abolitionist novel Uncle Tom's Cabin, released in book form in 1852, and were read both in the North and the South. Such novels contributed to the national discussions about slavery and were part of the rising sectional tensions. Much like other novels of the genre, Uncle Robin serves as an antithesis to Uncle Tom's Cabin. It portrays planters as benign and helpful to their slaves, with the villains portrayed as the abolitionists who stir up trouble.Uncle Tom's Cabin, E-notes  Plot  The novel features two black slaves from Virginia ‚Äì Uncle Robin (the loyal slave), and Uncle Tom (the disloyal slave, and a reference to the main character of Uncle Tom's Cabin). Whereas Tom is convinced to run away from his plantation by a group of abolitionists, Robin remains loyal to his master, and remains on the plantation. As the novel progresses, Uncle Robin is shown to have become a well-fed and prosperous slave by remaining loyal and obedient; he is looked after well by his master. Uncle Tom, abused by the abolitionists he fled with, has since died, together with several other slaves who escaped to the North and found more oppression under the abolitionists than on the plantation.  In other works  The scene of death of a Christianized slave was frequently used in anti-Tom novels, a cliche found in Mary Henderson Eastman's bestselling Aunt Phillis's Cabin; or, Southern Life As It Is (1852).M.H. Eastman, Chapter 26 of Aunt Phillis's Cabin (1852) As another example, Chapter VII of Uncle Robin ‚Äì entitled \\"Death in a Cabin\\" ‚Äì strongly resembles a similar chapter in the 1852 anti-Tom novel: Frank Freeman's Barber Shop by Rev. Baynard Rush Hall. He features the death of a slave named Dinah, who is a redeemed Christian, as do Eastman and Page.Stephen Railton, Frank Freeman's Barber Shop: A Tale, \\"Anti Uncle Tom Novels, Uncle Tom's Cabin & American Culture Website, University of Virginia, 1998‚Äì2009, accessed 23 February 2011  Publication history  J.W.

Plot summary Pursuing his passion for money, Feng Shui master CF Wong set up Harmoney Private Limited, a firm acting as middleman to potentially lucrative transactions. His first venture though ended in disaster when a supplier of highlighter failed to provide the product with a suitable ink colour. The buyer refused to complete the deal and withdrew payment, but the seller claims contractually, Harmoney was obliged to purchase the merchandise and demand full payment, with not-so-subtle hints of consequences if payment was not met. Desperate for a venture to produce quick cash, CF Wong reluctantly agreed to a special commission - to help ensure smooth promotional launch of the world's most luxurious office and business conference site on board the world's largest and most expensive aircraft, known as Skyparc. But when he learned members of the British Royal family were among the main investors of the project, his enthusiasm began to grow, overcoming his initial unwillingness to fly on the aircraft from Hong Kong to London. When they arrived in HK, his assistant, Joyce McQuinnie, was looking forward to enjoying the luxurious facilities but suddenly, a murder on the aircraft while it was undergoing finishing touches at the HK airport raised security alarms and another round of background checks on everyone who was supposed to join the promotional launch, and Joyce unexpectedly found herself blacklisted and taken out from the entourage. While CF Wong was tasked to ensure no \\"bad vibes\\" remained in the aircraft after the murder, Joyce decided to catch up with her friends based in HK, former schoolmates when she had been a student there before. To her surprise, she learned that the suspect in the murder case was none other than her former school friend with OCD, who was aloof in person but highly communicative over the internet. Events took a stranger turn when Joyce was approached by a mysterious man named Jackson, who wanted her to clear the suspect and even had high enough authority to enable Joyce to rejoin the junket.

Dician attempts to convince Ship to come with her to the One Sith, but Ship refuses, believing them weak for choosing to hide from the galaxy. Ship eventually arrives on Kesh, where a stranded Lost Tribe of the Sith remain isolated from the rest of the galaxy. Ship takes special interest in Sith Tyro Vestara Khai, and several days later, Vestara is called into the Circle Chambers before the Circle of Lords. Vestara tells the Lords that she and Ship shared their thoughts. The Lords then reveal that they will use Ship to learn more about the Sith, and also use Ship to fly offworld. Vestara is made Sith apprentice to Lady Rhea and will also fly and be trained by Ship. Ship reveals to the Lords that the Sith do not rule the galaxy and are very few in number. This revelation completely shatters the Lost Tribe's long-held belief and greatly shocks those present. Two years later, in 43.5 ABY, Jysella Horn is still attempting to get over the loss of her brother Valin, who has been encased in carbonite after contracting a mysterious illness. While in the New Jedi Temple with Jedi Master Cilghal, Horn is suddenly stricken with the same illness. This mental illness is what in our universe we would call the Capgras delusion. Now believing everyone is an imposter, Jysella flees and is pursued by other Jedi. During her escape, Horn begins to flow-walk (an ability she should not possess) and is able to avoid capture based on what she sees in the future. Horn escapes the Temple and battles Bazel Warv and Yaqeel Saav'etu, two of her closest friends. However, she is caught by GA security. Chief of State Natasi Daala arrives and announces that Horn will be encased in carbonite alongside her brother. Meanwhile, on the Jade Shadow, Luke Skywalker and his son Ben continue their journey to gather information about Jacen Solo's six-year sojourn. Cilghal contacts them and informs them about the recent events. Luke is concerned that each Jedi who has contracted the illness has displayed Force powers they hadn't learned, and furthermore, they were powers that Jacen had possessed. Luke speculates that Jacen may have flow- walked into the past and planted a kind of 'Force bomb' that would trigger the illnesses if he did not succeed in his quest for power. Luke and Ben decide to travel to the Kathol Rift in order to find the Aing-Tii, a xenophobic species with strange time-altering Force powers. Jacen was known to have visited these beings, and the Skywalkers suspect that this is where he learned to flow-walk. Once the Skywalkers reach the Rift, they encounter an Aing-Tii ship. After receiving directions, Luke and Ben arrive at a small moon and find an Aing-Tii craft waiting for them. The lone Aing-Tii presents them with a challenge: to communicate with him via the Force. While using the Force, the Skywalkers are shocked to find that the monk shines in the Force just as brightly as Luke, but the Aing-Tii's presence differs than any others they have felt. The encounter is too much for Ben, and he is forced to give up. Luke, however, maintains contact for quite some time and passes the test. They learn the Aing-Tii's name is Tadar'Ro. Tadar'Ro gives them the coordinates to the Aing- Tii homeworld. Arriving at the coordinates, the Skywalkers find that it is a rocky and mostly barren world. They are greeted by the Aing-Tii with a mixture of aggression, welcome, and neutral disinterest. Tadar'Ro tells them via an Aing-Tii translation device that the monks' peaceful society is being torn in two. Recently, a prophet who made many accurate prophesies, proclaimed that Those Who Dwell Beyond the Veil (god-like figures in the Aing-Tii religion) would return in his lifetime, then he died. This has led to much controversy, which was tearing apart Aing-Tii society. Tadar'Ro agrees to tell the two humans about Jacen's visit, teach Luke the ability to teleport objects using the Force, and teach Ben the ability to flow-walk. In return, the two Skywalkers must collect relics, various sacred artifacts that have a residue of Force power on them and ordained to be collected by Those Who Dwell Beyond the Veil, but the Aing-Tii are also banned from touching them. Back on Coruscant at the Livestock Exchange and Exhibition, the Solo family and Jedi Knights Radd Minker and Natua Wan are all attending. Han and Leia also wish to search for a pet for Allana. After viewing the tamer animals, Allana decides she wants to see the more ferocious and dangerous creatures. As they enter the exhibit holding the dangerous species, Wan suddenly contracts the same mysterious Force illness that has presented itself in the Horn children and Seff Hellin. The Falleen Jedi flees to the command center of the station and locks all the doors of the dangerous animal exhibit. She starts to retract the bridges over the cages leading to the doors and opens the animal pens. One spectator is injured and a child is almost eaten by boar-wolf. He is saved by Leia, who in turn chases Wan, who throws her voice using the Force, another ability of Jacen's. Leia, Jaina, and Radd engage Wan and render her unconscious. Unfortunately for the Jedi, much of what happened was recorded by journalist Javis Tyrr. Tyrr is also able to sneak a device into the lower areas of the Temple and get a record of Seff Hellin's imprisonment there. Tyrr broadcasts both these events on the holonews. Daala immediately demands a meeting with the Jedi, where she both humiliates them and tries to detain Hellin and Wan. The Jedi refuse but grant the GA full access to the two Jedi so a cure can be found. In return each of the Jedi who had been in on this plot, namely those involved in Darkmeld, has to be named and interviewed on the holonews. The exception is Tahiri Veila, who had resigned so Jaina did not give her name in. That night Jaina returns very tired to her quarters and finds Jagged Fel waiting for her. Fel then asks Solo to marry him, and she happily agrees. On the Aing-Tii homeworld, the monks are becoming restless and Tadar'Ro decides that even though the Skywalkers are not ready, they must travel to the Embrace, a series of caverns where the relics are stored. The Aing-Tii hopes that the two humans will be able to discover an item that would solve the problem. After a two-day hike, the trio arrives at a cave. Inside, the Skywalkers find thousands upon thousands of items. On Kesh, Vestara Khai has flown and learned from Ship, as did many others. The Lost Tribe of the Sith have destroyed various ships and then repaired them. They have now acquired the equivalent of a small fleet. Vestara has been put on the Eternal Crusader under her master Lady Rhea. While hauling back two new ships, Rhea feels a great presence in the Force at the same time as Luke touches a relic called the Codex. Inside the Embrace, Luke is temporarily stunned after the Codex enhanced his powers tremendously. He says afterward that he felt a disturbance in the region of space called The Maw and feels that he and Ben must travel there. Upon returning to the surface, the Skywalkers stand in front of the Aing-Tii crowd and tell them that though they learned much, the Aing-Tii must decide on their own whether to believe that the prophet was right; to accept the new beliefs that time was preordained or return to the old ways. Though briefly enraged, the Aing-Tii finally accept the advice and are closer to filling-in the rift in their society. Luke and Ben express gratitude to Tadar'Ro and tell him they are going into The Maw. The monk warns against it and reveals that Jacen also touched the Codex and felt a disturbance. The Skywalkers are also warned of the Mind Drinkers who dwell there. Before the Skywalkers leave, Ben performs the ability to flow-walk, as taught to him by Tadar'Ro, and he sees an innocent Jacen being taught. But Ben comes to realize that nothing he will do will change the past, and leaves with closure regarding Jacen's legacy. The Skywalkers then lift off in the Shadow, not knowing exactly what awaits them in The Maw. On Kesh, the leaders of the Lost Tribe of Sith discuss the matter of Luke Skywalker. Lady Rhea describes her experience and how Grand Lord Darish Vol had felt alone and unprotected. Vestara suddenly cried out, feeling Ship abruptly leave Kesh. The Lords' discussion ends as they decide to track down and recapture Ship. On Coruscant, Allana opens up for the first time after the excitement at the Exhibition. She expresses her wish for a nexu cub that had lost its mother to Leia in the fray. Tahiri Veila is sitting in her apartment, contemplating the events of the past few days, when she hears a knock at her door. She opens it to find armed GA officers who declare that she is under arrest for treason and murdering Grand Admiral Gilad Pellaeon two years earlier.

The museum was established at its current location in 1922, although its parent organization was started in 1839. The museum was named hamburgmuseum in 2006. It is located near the park in the center of Hamburg. The museum is commonly reviewed among the museums of the city of Hamburg. History in 1930 The Society of Hamburg History (Verein f√ºr Hamburgische Geschichte), founded in 1839, started compiling the Collection of Hamburg Antiquities (Sammlung Hamburger Altert√ºmer). First exhibits included architectural fragments of the demolished St. Mary's Cathedral and two monasteries. The main building at Holstenwall was designed by Fritz Schumacher and constructed between 1914 and 1922. The museum was built on the site of the former Bastion Henricus, a part of the baroque fortification which was erected between 1616 and 1625 by the Dutchman Jan van Valckenborgh in order to make the town impregnable. The museum courtyard was damaged in the great fire in 1842 and fully restored in 1995. A glass dome over the inner courtyard was completed in 1989. The glass courtyard was completed by the firm of Von Gerkan, Marg and Partners. This allowed increased museum space without an actual new building, because it allowed increased use of the courtyard. The covered courtyard was actually envisioned, or at least considered, as part of the original design, however the construction of the covering was deferred. The design uses a steel gridshell. The Hamburg Observatory occupied the area at the Museum from 1825 to 1912 before being moved to Bergedorf. The area was part of the old city wall defences built by the Dutchman Jan van Valckenborgh. These walls were part of Bastion Henricus which was a baroque fortification built between 1616 and 1625.The Museum, Hamburg Museum, accessed December 2011 The museum was formerly located at the Johanneum school. The museum became state-owned under the direction of Otto Lauffer in the early 1900s, though this was changed back in 1999. The museum adopted the name hamburgmuseum, and initials hm, in 2006. In 2008 the museum runs a program called (Society of friends of the museum of Hamburg history).Society of Friends of the Museum of Hamburg History, hamburgmuseum, accessed December 2011 The skull in question with its famous nail. In 2010 a pirate skull with a nail in it was stolen from HM. The skull was discovered in 1878, and forensic analysis believe it to be from the 1400s. At that time it was common for pirates to be executed by being beheaded, and then the skull would be put on an iron stake to display the consequences of this activity. A more precise determination was attempted by the museum in 2004 by DNA analysis, but there was no further confirmation. It was thought this might be from a particular execution of 30 during the age of the Hanseatic League. The skull was stolen on January 9, 2010, and it was thought it may be the skull of (in)famous pirate Klaus Stoertebeker. The skull was added to the museum's collection in 1922. In 2016 HM was considered as a candidate for repatriation of a century old German dog-tag. The dog tag belonged to a soldier that had gone MIA in world war one. =Exhibits in 2005= Over time there is a gradual shift with some temporary exhibits also.

He was a co-founder of restaurant chain Waffle House, which as of April 2018 consisted of 2,100 restaurants. Biography Born in Hawkinsville, Georgia on June 14, 1918, Tom Forkner was the fifth of seven children of Ben and Bessie Forkner; his siblings include Louise, Lawrence, Catherine, Ben, John, and William. Forkner graduated Young Harris Junior College before getting a law degree from the Woodrow Wilson College of Law. The son of a real estate agent, he practiced law until called to serve in World War II as an intelligence officer for the Manhattan Project. After his return from the war, he took over his father's real estate firm, working in Avondale Estates, Georgia. Waffle House This Waffle House in Fort Worth, Texas, is near the Texas Motor Speedway In 1949, Forkner sold a home to Joe Rogers, Sr. Inspired by the emergence of fast food chains like McDonald's, Rogers, who was a regional manager of the Toddle House chain of diners in Memphis, Tennessee, proposed that he and Forkner go into business together for a quick-service, sit-down restaurant. Forkner suggested a Toddle House, but Rogers felt the chain wasn't proper for the market. After Forkner secured the property, the pair developed the concept of the Waffle House together; Forkner proposed naming it after the most expensive item on the menu to promote it, while Rogers suggested keeping a 24-hour schedule. The first Waffle House opened in Avondale in 1955. Over the next several years, the pair expanded the chain, beginning to offer franchises after 1960. As of 2005, Forkner and Rogers, though having passed the helm of the company to Joe Rogers, Jr. in 1973, still worked for the company occasionally, including on major holidays. In 2007, Forkner was still visiting his office daily. Golf Forkner started golfing as part of a lifestyle change after health problems put him in the hospital in 1959. He was widely successful as a senior golfer, and on January 6, 2007 was inducted into the Georgia Golf Hall of Fame. Among his achievements, he was on four occasions named the Georgia Senior Champion (1968, 1969, and 1986) and twice International Senior Champion (1974 and 1980). In 2003 and 2004, he was World Super Seniors Champion for ages 80 and Over. Forkner, who competed in the 1980 and 1981 U.S. Senior Opens, once placed second there, which in keeping in mind the competition he described to The Augusta Chronicle in 2007 as \\"probably the single best thing I ever did.\\" Personal life and death In the 1940s, he married wife Martha, with whom he shares three children. As of 2007, he lived in Duluth, Georgia. Forkner died on April 27, 2017 at the age of 98, only one month after the death of Joe Rogers, his business partner.

There is strong evidence that treating water supplies in hospitals with this technique decreases the risk. Effectiveness Ionization can be an effective process to control Legionella in potable water distribution systems found in health facilities, hotels, nursing homes, and large buildings. In 2003, ionization became the first such hospital disinfection process to have fulfilled a proposed four-step modality evaluation; by then it had been adopted by over 100 hospitals. \\"(1) Demonstrated efficacy of Legionella eradication in vitro using laboratory assays, (2) anecdotal experiences in preventing legionnaires‚Äô disease in individual hospitals, (3) controlled studies in individual hospitals, and (4) validation in confirmatory reports from multiple hospitals during a prolonged time.\\" Additional studies indicate ionization is superior to thermal eradication. A 2011 review found copper-silver ionization to be the only Legionella control technology which has been validated through a proposed four-step modality evaluation (need reference or description of \\"modality\\" in this context since it does not apply in all situations). =Guidelines= Copper-silver ionization technology is recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to control Legionella within potable water distribution networks found in hospitals, hotels and other large type facilities. The level of ions generated has been reported to be usually below EPA Safe Water Drinking Act Lead and Copper Rule AL for copper. The AL for copper in potable water is 1.3 ppm (Cu) and the SCL for silver is 0.1 ppm (Ag) (which is the same as 100 ppb). It is important to collect and handle samples correctly in order to get accurate results. Suboptimal timing of specimen shipment for testing at reference laboratories may contribute to silver concentration above recommendations. Industry leaders who manufacture copper-silver ionization technology recommend a copper concentration of 0.4 to 0.8 ppm and a silver concentration of 40 to 60 ppb, which are compliant with EPA drinking water standards. Europe The British Health and Safety Commission regulates U.K. ionization, advising regular system monitoring to ensure ions reach all water circuits. Also, copper in drinking water is limited to 2 ppm (mg/L) by the European Community whereas Legionella control only requires 0.4 to 0.8 ppm in concentration...well below the permissible limits. Headquarters (ECH) in Brussels, Belgium, and silver is not prescribed by the ECH. The EU limits copper to 1.0 ppm‚Äîlower than the USA copper AL of 1.3 ppm. The EU does not have any guidelines for ionic silver concentrations‚Äîthe US SCL is 0.1 ppm (100 ppb). In February 2012, the European Commission issued a non-inclusion decision regarding the use of copper as a biocide in Europe. This decision was based on a failure of industry to supply the commission with required information regarding copper and was not based on health or efficacy concerns. In response to this decision, five member states‚ÄîSpain, the UK, Norway, Poland, and the Netherlands‚Äîhave applied to the Commission to allow for the continued use of copper as a biocide in their respective nations. In addition, the UK authority, the HSE, has issued a statement stating that the derogation application for the UK has been informally granted. Industry has responded by forming a Taskforce to ensure full and long term compliance with the regulatory issues facing copper in the EU. Process Copper-silver ionization disperses positively charged copper and silver ions into the water system. The ions bond electrostatically with negative sites on bacterial cell walls and denature proteins. Over the long term, the presence of copper and silver ions destroy biofilms and slimes that can harbor Legionella, the bacteria responsible for Legionnaires' disease (legionellosis). It can take 30 to 45 days for the copper and silver ions to penetrate a biofilm. Flow cells (part of the ionization unit) should be cleaned periodically to maintain the system. In a hospital that is not defined as a public water system, this task may be delegated to the facility's utility engineers. If a hospital is defined as a public water system, the maintenance personnel may be required to have a State-issued water treatment license. In the US, different states have specific regulations for hospitals and drinking water treatment that should be reviewed before going forward with installation of copper-silver ionization. Forensic scientist Randy Fornshell of the Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Science Center explains that copper-silver ionization is a modern implementation of the ancient Greek practice of reducing bacteria in wine vessels by lining them with silver, and controlling algae and fungi with copper. Fornshell notes that copper-silver ionization has been effective in swimming pools (it is an alternative to chlorine) and is becoming adopted by larger municipalities. Replacing chlorination with copper-silver ionization to keep water safe was one response of Frederick Memorial Hospital, Frederick, Maryland, to new requirements in the 2001 Guidelines for Design and Construction of Hospital and Healthcare Facilities, issued by the American Institute of Architects. Ionization is in many cases installed because more convenient and cost-effective than other approaches. This implies that Maryland does not identify systems that post-treat potable water as public water systems and require them to maintain a residual of chlorine or chloramine in their distribution system, as required for treated surface water in the Safe Drinking Water Act. =Regulations= It is possible to operate copper-silver ionization without exceeding the copper Action Level (AL) and silver secondary maximum contaminant levels (SMCLs) set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in the Safe Water Drinking Act's Lead and Copper Rule (Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, 40 CFR) in Part 141, Subpart I; and 40 CFR Part 143, respectively.

It is found in shallow water in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, its range extending from Norway to France, and also both on the eastern coast of Canada and the United States, and the Pacific coast from the Aleutian Islands to Morro Bay, California. Description Acanthadoris pilosa grows to a length of about , or occasionally as much as . It gives the impression of being fluffy because the body is covered with long, fleshy pointed papillae. At the head end are two rhinophores, much larger than the papillae, which house the sensory organs; these typically are bent towards the rear of the animal. At the posterior end there is a distinctive ring of up to nine gills. This sea slug has a uniform colour which may be anything from whitish to pale purplish-brown to darker brown or charcoal grey. Juveniles are often speckled. Distribution This species was first described from Norway. It has been reported from the North Atlantic Ocean on both the American and European coasts, and from the Pacific Northwest.Picton, B.E. & Morrow, C.C. (2015).

Hosanna discusses her relationship with her mother and shows her anxieties over her knowledge of who she really is. The scholar and activist Viviane Namaste has criticized Hosanna, which ends with its protagonist identifying as a gay man after a series of humiliations, as reinforcing a patriarchal, transphobic ideology in which a \\"reliance on the ideas of illusion, deception, and betrayal presupposes that we as transgendered people do not know who we are.

Since diplomatic relations were established back in 1952, Canada has an embassy in Jakarta, while Indonesia maintains an embassy in Ottawa. Indonesia also has consulates in Toronto and Vancouver. Canada and Indonesia are partners in a number of multilateral organizations, such as Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the G-20, Cairns Group, and the World Trade Organization (WTO). According to a 2013 BBC World Service Poll, 49% of Indonesians view Canada's influence positively, with 16% expressing a negative view.2013 World Service Poll BBC History Indonesian Embassy in Ottawa Indonesia-Canada diplomatic relations formally began when the two countries signed an agreement to open diplomatic missions in their respective capitals on October 9, 1952. However, relations between the two countries started in 1948, when Indonesia was struggling to gain international recognition for its independence from its former colonial power in 1945. Canada, through General Andrew McNaughton as the President of the United Nations' Security Council, managed to break the deadlock in the negotiation on resolving the conflict between Indonesia and the Netherlands that resulted in the adoption of Resolution 67/1949, which endorsed the establishment of a Dutch‚ÄìIndonesian Round Table Conference. Tripartite negotiations lead to the international recognition of Indonesia's sovereignty in December 1949. Relations have been generally cordial. Both countries shared similar views on the Archipelagic state principle during negotiations on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Indonesia and Canada were both members of the International Commission of Control and Supervision in Vietnam. Differences emerged in the 1990s over human rights issues and the East Timor dispute. In the Post-Suharto era these irritants have been removed. Development assistance Canada began to support economic development in Indonesia through the Colombo Plan during the 1950s. For thirty years between 1967 and 2007, Canada provided aid to Indonesia within the international coordination arrangements established under the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia and the Consultative Group on Indonesia. As a development partner, Canada works closely with Indonesia to support sustainable economic growth and reduce vulnerability to poverty. The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) managed Canada's bilateral program for development assistance to Indonesia until it was folded into Global Affairs Canada. CIDA made Indonesia a major \\"country of concentration\\" for Canadian development cooperation, with Indonesia ranked as high as second place among Canadian aid recipients in the 1980s. Canadian support for Indonesian development continues at a lower level. Trade Data from the Indonesian Investment Coordinating Board shows Canadian investment in Indonesia for the period of 2005 up to 2011 consisted of 37 projects worth US$157 million. The major sector both by number of projects and investment value is the mining industry. The largest number of Canadian investment projects are on the island of Java, but the largest dollar value of investment is located in Sulawesi.

It is located in Northern Kenya, on the eastern shore of Lake Turkana, north of Sibiloi National Park and near the Ethiopian border. Numerous hominin fossils have been found near Ileret, including Homo erectus footprints dating back to about 1.5 million years ago, making them the second oldest hominin footprints ever found after those at Laetoli, Tanzania.BBC News, 26 February 2009: Earliest 'human footprints' found  Hominin fossils found near Ileret  Besides the Homo erectus footprints, numerous other fossils have been found near the Ileret site. In 2012‚Äì2013, a team of researchers from Stony Brook University found new hominin fossils near Ileret, in two sites within the Kolom Odiet area. The fossils were representative of three different individuals, composing of two partial skeletons ‚Äì KNM-ER (Kenya National Museum ‚Äì East Rudolf) 64061 and KNM-ER 64062 ‚Äì and an almost entirely completed mandible, KNM-ER 64060. KNM-ER 64060 and KNM-ER 64061 date back to 2.02 to 2.03 Ma, and KNM-ER 64062 goes back 1.82 to 1.86 million years ago. The KNM-ER 64060 mandible is only missing the right central incisor. The KNM- ER 64061 partial skeleton includes most of both humeral shafts, a partial right ulna and right clavicle, and a right shoulder blade. Its longer bones appeared to be slender, yet thick in its cross-sections. The KNM-ER 64062 skeleton possesses parts of a distal right humerus and scaphoid, and parts of a right foot with both primitive and derived features. These three individuals most likely represent members of early Homo, the mandible being from Homo habilis and the partial skeletons being from Homo erectus. Homo erectus footprints at Ileret  Fossilized footprints of Homo erectus were found in Ileret, Kenya. Science reported that there were multiple trails of footprints found at the Ileret site: ‚Äútwo trails of two prints each, one of seven prints and a number of isolated prints.‚Äù Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. These footprints reveal that these early hominins most likely traveled in groups‚Äîevidence which researchers see as a sign of social behavior.Citation error. See inline comment how to fix. Certain social behaviors distinguish humans from other primate species. Researchers attempt to find evidence of similar behaviors in the fossil or footprint records, however, it is difficult because this kind of fossil evidence is lacking. Homo erectus fossils were discovered in 1.5 million-year-old layers of sediment. These fossils supplied information about soft-tissue and foot structure. Unlike the fossils, the footprints provide researchers with information about early foot anatomy. Moreover, other Homo erectus fossils have been found in nearby areas and are the approximately the same age as the footprints found at Ileret.  Homo erectus compared to other hominins  Differences have been found between these footprints and common apes. According to Rutgers University, ‚Äúthe big toe is parallel to the other toes, unlike that of apes where it is separated in a grasping configuration useful in the trees.‚Äù The arch of the footprint is also human-like and the toes are much shorter than those of an ape. Short toes are a sign of ‚Äúupright bipedal stance.‚Äù Additionally, relevant observations point to similarities between H. erectus and modern humans. The footprints reveal comparable body weights, strides and gaits. These early hominins are the first to have such similar body proportions to modern humans (Homo sapiens). Interpretation of a diagramatics o Human footprint in Laetoli (3.7 My) thought to be from A. afarensis; Ileret (1.5 My), from H. erectus, and H. sapiens. The green lines represent the points under the same pressure/weight.  Evidence of bipedalism  Bipedalism is a characteristic of modern humans. Fossil evidence reveals that hominins walked on two feet as early as 6 to 7 million years ago. It can be difficult to reconstruct gait evolution due to the inadequacy and scarcity of the fossil record. Often, fragments of bones are discovered and offer little information about hominins‚Äô walking manners. Additionally, the hominin fossil record does not provide information concerning the social patterns of modern humans and other primates‚Äîpatterns which drove evolution. The Ileret footprints provide significant evidence that Homo erectus was a bipedal hominin. The footprints provide evidence for a ‚Äúmodern human-like weight transfer‚Äù and support earlier discussions of Homo erectus‚Äô arched foot.

It is now known as the CBS Sports Network. Early in his career Pernetti served as a programming executive and deal-maker at ABC Sports overseeing college football, college basketball, the PGA Tour, and other professional sports properties and relationships. In 1995 Pernetti was hired in his first job to help ABC Sports to launch its first-ever online presence on AOL and helped to create two-screen programming on-line during ABC Sports biggest events on Television including the Super Bowl, World Series, College Football, PGA Tour Golf, and much more.

He left ABC Sports in 2003 and joined CSTV as Vice President of Programming & Talent. Pernetti was responsible for all deal-making and rights acquisitions headlined by the acquisition of exclusive regular season rights to Army Football, Navy Football, and his management of the agreement between the Mountain West Conference and CSTV that produced the MountainWest Sports Network (MTN), the first-ever collegiate conference branded network. In 2006, CSTV was acquired by CBS Television Pernetti was promoted to Executive Vice President, Content to oversee the content strategy, programming, rights acquisitions, and relationships for CBS College Sports Network. He was named a recipient of the Sports Business Journal's \\"40 Under 40\\" Award recognizing the most powerful and influential people in the sports business under the age of 40 in 2008 and a recipient of the MultiChannel News 40 Under 40 recognizing the most influential people in cable Television also in 2008. Pernetti was named Chief Executive at Major League Soccer expansion franchise New York City FC in 2013 and built the franchise on the commercial business side in sponsorship, licensing, merchandise and apparel, ticket and premium seating sales, marketing, fan engagement and ran the day-to-day relationship with the franchise co-owners the New York Yankees and Manchester City Football Club and City Football Group. In 2015 Pernetti was recruited from NYCFC by WME who had recently acquired IMG to serve as President of IMG College. Pernetti ran the business at IMG College from March 2015 through April of 2019 and worked as part of the team that oversaw and executed the $2,000,000,000 merger between IMG College and Learfield. The company is now known as Learfield IMG College. Following the successful transition of the IMG College business, Pernetti was named Executive Vice President, Endeavor, the parent company to WME, IMG, the UFC and various other properties and companies. From 2001 to 2009, Pernetti moonlighted as a football color analyst for Rutgers Football and Sports USA Radio network's coverage of the NFL. He also was a regular TV contributor as a college football and college business analyst on SNY in 2006 and 2007, and performed TV game analyst duties on FSN and ESPN Regional Television from 2002 to 2005. Director of Athletics, Rutgers University On April 1, 2009 Pernetti began work as the Director of Intercollegiate Athletics at Rutgers University as part of a five-year contract. In the role he oversaw 24 men's and women's sports, fundraising and development, a staff of more than 200 employees and also oversaw coaching searches and hires in men's and women's sports. Pernetti is credited with transforming the business at Rutgers and for record-breaking fundraising results in four years. During his tenure, Rutgers Athletics generated more than $100M in incremental revenue for the department. Pernetti is also credited, given his broad-based media background, with the creative and powerful amplification of the Rutgers Athletics brand, and creating more media visibility than ever before for Athletics. Pernetti made his mark by strategically and quietly navigating the chaos of conference expansion from 2009-2012 and perfectly positioning Rutgers by negotiating the agreement to bring Rutgers to the Big Ten Conference in 2012 . For his efforts, Pernetti was named one of the five candidates in 2013 for Sports Business Journal National Athletic Director of the Year. =Men's basketball= Pernetti was recognized nationally following Rutgers' announcement of the move to the Big Ten for his vision, leadership and business acumen. He was recognized as one of the top 5 key power players in New Jersey sports and politics and was profiled as a visionary . Rutgers President Robert Barchi called Pernetti \\"remarkable\\" on November 20, 2012 when he credited him solely with bringing the opportunity to fruition. Barchi stated \\"I applaud Tim Pernetti on this extremely positive development for Rutgers. He has been working for a long time to ensure that, in this period of athletic conference realignment, Rutgers would emerge in a stronger, more advantageous position. Joining the Big Ten is the most appropriate match for Rutgers with the very best long-term potential for our athletic program. It is where we belong.\\" Pernetti did however come under fire in April 2013 when a video surfaced showing men's basketball coach Mike Rice mistreating players during practice. The video showed Rice throwing basketballs at players, and calling players names including homophobic slurs. When Pernetti was made aware of Rice's behavior at team practices, he followed Rutgers policy and procedure launching an internal and third-party investigation. Pernetti wanted to fire Rice immediately but the investigation proved results that were unclear in supporting a termination for cause. The Committee for Athletics, and Rutgers attorneys and Pernetti suspended Rice with more severe punishment than had been seen in college basketball in the modern era. Rice was removed from the program, suspended without pay for 3 games, fined $50,000 and required to complete and satisfactorily pass anger management training. The reasons behind the discipline were not made public. After ESPN's Outside the Lines aired the video on April 2, 2013, many expressed their disbelief on blogs and on Twitter that Rice had not been fired and that Rutgers should be held accountable for its leniency toward Rice, whom Pernetti had hired as one of his first major acts as Rutgers AD. Elected officials joined the ensuing outcry, with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie condemning Rice's behavior, and State Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver demanding that Rice be fired.ESPN. Rutgers fires coach Mike Rice When school president Robert Barchi saw the video for the first time on the night of April 2, after refusing to watch it for months despite Pernetti's urging (though Barchi had signed off on the decision to suspend Rice in November and publicly recognized and commended Pernetti for his handling of the situation), he called in Pernetti and told him that Rice had to leave immediately. Rice was fired the next day.http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2013/04/mike_rice_fired_rutgers_univer.html On April 3, Barchi caved to the political and public/social media pressure of the situation and in order to save his own job told Pernetti that he also would likely be fired, and gave him the option of either resigning or being fired. After two days of negotiations, Pernetti resigned on April 5 in what he called \\"the best interest of Rutgers\\" . He later made clear that he wanted to fire Rice in December, but was advised at the time that the results of the investigation, attorney's recommendations and Rutgers policy would not support a firing. Alumni and prominent donors spoke publicly, rescinded their donations and financial commitments, and expressed outrage at Rutgers actions to scapegoat Pernetti for a process and a decision owned and run by many. Former student-athletes such as Shaun O'Hara, Eric LeGrand, Devin and Jason McCourty, Brian Leonard, Mohammed Sanu, Ray Rice and others in addition to numerous other supporters publicly spoke on his high character and poor manner in which the situation was handled. Once Pernetti resigned, alumni, fans, donors and former players invested to permanently commemorate Pernetti's unmatched contributions to Rutgers as both a student-athlete and Director of Athletics by purchasing a brick on the Scarlet Walk where the football team walks on game-day to enter the stadium. Pernetti Brick at the Rutgers Scarlet Walk Personal life Pernetti is involved in many charitable and community organizations. He sits on the board of directors of the REED Academy, a school in Oakland, NJ serving children with autistic spectrum disorder.

It was entered into the 1963 Cannes Film Festival. Plot synopsis The film is a work of ethnofiction. It shows life in a small isolated community, when the influence of the Catholic Church in Quebec was still strong. For centuries the inhabitants of Ile-aux-Coudres, a small island in the St. Lawrence River, trapped beluga whales by sinking a weir of saplings into the offshore mud at low tide. After 1920, the practice was abandoned. In 1962, a team of National Film Board of Canada filmmakers led by director Perrault and cinematographer Brault arrived on the island to make a cin√©ma-v√©rit√© documentary about the people and their isolated life. They encouraged the islanders to revive the practice of beluga fishing. The live animal they caught was then driven on a truck to an aquarium in New York City. The film also shows the daily life of the islanders, and their celebrations, such as the festival at mid-Lent (mi- car√™me). Reception The resulting film was hugely popular in Quebec, and today is recognized as a classic of Canadian cinema. Pour la suite du monde has been consistently ranked by critics as one of the best ever made and it represents a major development in the Direct Cinema movement, moving away from simple observation to a more immediate participation and a great emphasis on the words of the people portrayed. It received a Special Award and was named Film of the Year at the 1964 Canadian Film Awards. In 1984 the Toronto International Film Festival ranked the film eighth in the Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time.\\"Top 10 Canadian Films of All Time,\\" The Canadian Encyclopedia, 2012, URL accessed April 28, 2013.

The fort acted as a fortification system for the islands of Banda where during the period, the only place in the world where nutmeg was produced. History The modest early Fort Belgica on top of a hill, overlooking the Fort Nassau below. Before Fort Belgica, there was a 16th-century Portuguese fort standing on a hill in Banda Neira. On September 4, 1611, Pieter Both, the first Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, instructed the construction of a new fort to fortify the hill which dominated the original Dutch fortress, Fort Nassau. This fort was to be named either Belgica or Nederland, and it became Fort Belgica. Fort Belgica was a modest square fort on top of a hill. In 1662, Jan Pieterszoon Coen ordered the renovation of the original fort, so it was replaced with a more solid redoubt that could accommodate 40 men. Newer design of Fort Belgica features a pentagonal shape. By the mid seventeenth century earthquakes, the tropical monsoonal climate, and poor original construction materials and techniques had resulted in the structure becoming dilapidated. In 1667, Governor Cornelis Speelman instructed Engineer Adriaan de Leeuw to redesign and reconstruct the fort. The result was the present \\"castle\\", the major modification works started in 1672 and being completed by 1673. The new Fort Belgica was built from stone shipped to the island. The new design consisted of a low outer pentagonal structure with five angled corner bastions and a higher inner pentagon with five tall circular towers. It was the only fort of this kind throughout the Banda Islands. Despite over 300,000 Guilders spent on the modifications, an armament of 50 guns and a garrison of 400 men Fort Belgica surrendered to a British fleet in 1796 without a shot fired. Returned to Dutch control in 1803, it was again taken by the British in 1810, when it was stormed by Captain Cole and his men. Partially demolished in 1904, it was incompletely rebuilt in 1919. In 1991, following the order of General Benny Moerdani, at the time the Minister of Defense and Security of Indonesia, the fort was thoroughly restored. Layout Fort Belgica sits on top of a hill on the southwestern part of the island Banda Neira. The fort overlooks the Fort Nassau, lower on the foot of the hill to the south. Pentagonal Structures in Fort Belgica. Fort Belgica is pentagonal in form. It consists of a low outer pentagonal structure and a higher inner pentagonal structure. A stair access on the southernmost wall of the outer pentagon provides the sole point of entry to the fort. The lower pentagonal structure is equipped with five bastions, from the left hand side of the access point: Galge punt, Moorsche punt, Leugenaar punt, Metaale punt, and Klokke punt, each equipped with a bartizan. The higher inner pentagonal structure housed several rooms which was arranged surrounding a pentagonal-shaped inner courtyard. A stairs in one of the room provide an access point to the top level. World Heritage Status In January 2015, Belgica Fort was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List as part of the Historic and Marine Landscape of the Banda Islands.

In 1789, Spain created two settlements in Santa Cruz de Nuca and Fort San Miguel, both located in Nootka Sound. At the extent of the Spanish Empire in the Americas, Spain controlled territories from the farthest tip of South America to present day southern Alberta and Saskatchewan.Library of Congress: Louisiana: European Explorations and the Louisiana Purchase In July 1935, Canada and Spain established diplomatic relations.Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores de Espa√±a: Canad√° (in Spanish) Memorial to the Mackenzie‚ÄìPapineau Battalion in Ottawa From 1936‚Äì1939, Spain was embroiled in a civil war between the Republican faction and Nationalist faction. Canada, was officially neutral during the conflict, however, over 1,700 Canadians volunteered and fought for the Republican faction in Spain. Canada and the Spanish Civil War: An IntroductionCanada and the Spanish Civil War At first, the Canadian volunteers joined the primarily American Lincoln Battalion (also known as the Abraham Lincoln Brigade) and the George Washington Battalion before creating a primarily Canadian brigade known as the Mackenzie‚ÄìPapineau Battalion (Mac- Paps). During that time, the Canadian Parliament passed the \\"Foreign Enlistment Act in 1937\\" outlawing participation by Canadians in foreign wars. During the civil war, approximately 700 Canadians lost their lives fighting. In 1938, the Republican Faction was taking heaving loses and realized that they were losing the war. Several Canadian fighters left Spain and returned to Canada before General Francisco Franco entered Madrid and ended the war in April 1939. Since the end of World War II, Canada and Spain enjoy friendly and close diplomatic relations. In December 1959, both nations eliminated visa requirements for their citizens. In March 1995, relations between both nations reached an all-time low when a Spanish fishing boat called the \\"Estai\\" with a crew of 45 was seized just outside of Canada's Exclusive Economic Zone because the Canadian government accused Spain of overfishing turbots near its waters, triggering the Turbot War (Guerra del flet√°n in Spanish).Canada and Spain Face Off Over Fishing ZoneCanada, Spain, and the European Union in the Turbot War During the crisis, Spain imposed visas on Canadian citizens visiting Spain and threatened to break diplomatic relations with Canada.El Pa√≠s: Espa√±a impone el visado a Canad√° y amenaza con romper relaciones diplom√°ticas (in Spanish) Spain began sending Serviola-class patrol boat to protect their trawlers when Canada began to cut the nets of Spanish trawlers fishing in the area.The Turbot War Support from the European Union was split during the crisis, with the United Kingdom and Ireland supporting Canada while mainland Europe and Iceland supported Spain. During negations between Canada and the European Union to resolve the issue, the crew of Estai posted a $500,000 bail and returned to Spain. The crisis was resolved when Canada and the European Union agreed to a deal on April 5. Under this agreement Spain was forced to leave the disputed zone and Canada's right to eject foreign fishing vessels from the area using military force was accepted. Under the deal Canada's own Greenland turbot quota was reduced, and they refunded the $500,000 fine to the owners of the Estai. Since the crisis, Canadian-Spanish relations improved and in 2007, a Memorandum of Understanding on Fisheries Cooperation was signed between both nations.Fisheries and Oceans Canada: Memoranda of Understanding (Spain) High-level visits Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S√°nchez meeting during the 2018 Brussels summit.

A graduate of Rice University, Sands served with the Naval Ordnance Laboratory and the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II. After the war, Sands studied cosmic rays for his doctorate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) under the supervision of Bruno Rossi. Sands went to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in 1950, and helped build and operate its 1.5 GeV electron synchrotron. He became deputy director for the construction and early operation of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) in 1963. Sands later joined the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) as a professor of physics, and served as its Vice Chancellor for Science from 1969 to 1972. In 1998, The American Physical Society awarded him the Robert R. Wilson Prize \\"for his many contributions to accelerator physics and the development of electron-positron and proton colliders.\\" Early life and education Matthew Linzee Sands was born in Oxford, Massachusetts, on October 20, 1919. His parents were Linzee Sands and Beatrice Goyette, both of whom were bookkeepers. He had a brother, Roger, and a sister, Claire, who was seven years younger. As a 12-year-old Boy Scout, Sands was motivated by his scoutmaster, who was a radio amateur, to build his own shortwave radio receiver. With the aid of information from the Radio Amateur's Handbook, he constructed it out of parts scavenged from old radios. He was encouraged to study mathematics and science by his high school math teacher, John Chafee, a graduate of Brown University. After high school, Sands entered Clark University, where he studied physics and mathematics, and eventually received his Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) in 1940. At Clark, his physics professors were Theodore P. Jorgensen, who became famous for his book \\"The Physics of Golf\\", and Percy M. Roope, who participated in the rocket experiments of Robert H. Goddard. As part of a job subsidized at 35 cents per hour by the National Youth Administration, they assigned him to build physics equipment in the machine shops, where he became familiar with the drill press, lathe, and other metalworking tools. Sand went on to receive his Master of Arts (M.A.) in physics from Rice University. At Rice, Sands took graduate courses in relativity, statistical mechanics, and thermodynamics from Harold A. Wilson, who was the first chair of the Rice physics department. He also completed experimental studies of ferromagnetism. At Rice, Sands met his first wife, Elizabeth, an undergraduate student there. World War II In 1941, Sands went to the Naval Ordnance Laboratory in Washington, D.C., where he learned more about electronics under Joseph F. Keithley. Keithly and Sands developed two influence mines, from which three patents were derived. They performed sea tests of a working prototype, but the program was stopped for unknown reasons. By 1943, Sands had become impatient with the Navy's bureaucracy. After discussing the situation with Wilson, he appeared unannounced in Santa Fe, New Mexico, at the office of Dorothy McKibbin, who had been designated to meet newcomers to Los Alamos Laboratory. After she made a telephone call to the personnel office, which had just received a desperate call for electronics people, Sands was bussed to Los Alamos. To his surprise, he was met by Jorgenson, who had just joined the Manhattan Project after leaving Clark and going to Nebraska. He immediately took Sands to the library to read Robert Serber's Los Alamos Primer, which introduced him to the basic physical principles of nuclear fission as they were known at the time, and their implications for nuclear weapon design. By this time, Sands had extensive experience with electronics and was immediately thrust into the electronics group, which was tasked with making instruments for the whole laboratory, and whose head was Darol Froman. Within this group, his close collaborators were William Elmore, William Higinbotham, and Ernest Titterton. Anybody who had an instrumentation problem would come to the group for help. As a result, Sands worked with Luis Alvarez, Robert Bacher, Hans Bethe, Richard Feynman, Otto Frisch, Bruno Rossi, Emilio Segr√®, Robert Walker and Robert Wilson; many of these famous physicists played important roles in his later career. In particular, he formed a close relationship with Rossi, with whom he later decided to work on his post-war Ph.D. degree. Rossi was most interested in the group's nuclear electronics equipment: pulse counters and amplifiers, discriminators, and scalers. In this area, Sands designed and patented a pulse height analyzer, and with Otto Frisch and Elmore, a pulse amplifier. He also created electronics for more general purposes, such as precise temperature regulation, and control of electroplating operations. In 1945, the Los Alamos Laboratory carried out the Trinity nuclear test at a remote site near Alamogordo, New Mexico. Sands worked with Walker on a piezoelectric pressure measurement of the atmospheric shock wave produced by \\"the gadget\\", a prototype of the Fat Man weapon later dropped on Nagasaki. Their instrumentation worked well during a test explosion of 108 tons of TNT in May 1945, but no information was obtained during the Trinity test on July 16, 1945, because an unexpected rain shower the night before soaked the apparatus. To raise public consciousness of issues raised by Trinity, David Hawkins, William Higinbotham, Philip Morrison, Robert Wilson, Sands, and others formed the Los Alamos Association of Atomic Scientists. As a founding member, Sands put out its weekly newsletter. On November 30, 1945, this organization merged with similar groups within the Manhattan Project and at Oak Ridge to form the Federation of Atomic Scientists, which soon changed its name to the Federation of American Scientists (FAS). In 1946, Sands and Elmore wrote \\"Electronics: Experimental Techniques\\", which was published in 1949 by McGraw-Hill. This book presented many ideas and circuits developed at Los Alamos, and became a standard reference for post-war nuclear instrumentation. Massachusetts Institute of Technology After the success of the Manhattan Project and the Radiation Laboratory, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) moved into a new era of \\"big science\\" funded by the US government. This era was predicted in a 1945 report, Science, The Endless Frontier, written by Vannevar Bush, who was an MIT graduate and influential head of the wartime Office of Scientific Research and Development. MIT's expansion into physics was encouraged by its president Karl Compton and by the head of the physics department, John C. Slater. The expansion of nuclear physics at MIT was spearheaded by Jerrold R. Zacharias, who joined the Los Alamos Laboratory late in the war, and recruited Bruno Rossi and Victor Weisskopf as MIT professors. Within MIT's new Laboratory for Nuclear Science, headed by Zacharias, Rossi was assigned to create a cosmic ray research group. He recruited four young scientists who had been at Los Alamos, including Sands, and two who had been in the Radiation Laboratory, as Ph.D. candidates. All were more mature than typical graduate students, with several years of wartime research experience. They were paid a stipend similar to that of a postdoctoral researcher, which enabled them to support families during their graduate studies. The laboratory was funded by the Office of Naval Research. With Rossi as his academic advisor, and with the aid of a Boeing B-29 Superfortress aircraft borrowed from the United States Air Force, Sands carried out his thesis research on the slow muon component of cosmic rays. He measured the intensity of low energy muons as a function of altitude up to , and derived their spectrum at production and as they propagated through the atmosphere. This information was important because most atmospheric cosmic rays are muons. Sands received his Ph.D. in physics from MIT in 1948, writing his thesis on \\"The meson component of cosmic radiation\\". Sands then joined the faculty as an assistant professor, and continued his cosmic ray research in Rossi's group. Another project of the Laboratory for Nuclear Science was a synchrotron particle accelerator, which was designed to accelerate electrons to an energy of 350 MeV. The accelerator was funded by the Office of Naval Research and built under the supervision of Ivan A. Getting, who was a professor of electrical engineering and had worked at the Radiation Laboratory on the extremely successful SCR‚Äë584 radar. Although its construction began in 1946, the accelerator had not begun to work by 1949. In response, Zacharias asked Sands to assist. This was Sands's introduction to accelerator physics, and with his help the machine became operational early in 1950. In 1948, Sands divorced his first wife, Elizabeth, in Reno, Nevada. She remained in Weston, Massachusetts, with their two children, while Sands married Eunice Hawthorne, a sister-in-law of his high school math teacher, John Chafee, and moved with her into MIT's Westgate housing units for married students. In early 1950, in his words: Later life The Feynman Lectures on Physics including Feynman's Tips on Physics: The Definitive and Extended Edition (2005) Sands went to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), where he helped build and operate a 1.5 GeV electron synchrotron. He was the first to demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, the role of quantum effects in electron particle accelerators. He also studied beam instabilities, wake fields, beam- cavity interactions, and other phenomena. In 1963, Sands became deputy director for the construction and early operation of the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). When Richard Feynman was deciding whether or not to accept the 1965 Nobel Prize‚Äîdue to a disdain for the added notoriety it might bring‚ÄîSands convinced Feynman that not accepting it would bring even more attention. Sands later joined the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) as a professor of physics, and served as its Vice Chancellor for science from 1969 to 1972. After retiring from UCSC in 1985, Sands worked as a consultant for SLAC and also as a consultant for Bay View Elementary School and Santa Cruz High School in Santa Cruz, California, developing computer systems and physics lab activities for students. From 1960 to 1966, Sands served on the Commission on College Physics, which carried out a national program to modernize physics instruction in the colleges and universities of the United States. He helped Feynman and Robert B. Leighton write the 1964 physics textbook Feynman Lectures on Physics, based upon the lectures given by Feynman to undergraduate students at Caltech between 1961 and 1963. He was involved in the creation of Kresge College, where he met Freya Kidner, a student there who subsequently became his third wife. He received a Distinguished Service Award from the American Association of Physics Teachers in 1972, and in 1998 the American Physical Society awarded him the Robert R. Wilson Prize \\"for his many contributions to accelerator physics and the development of electron-positron and proton colliders.\\" Sands died in Santa Cruz on September 13, 2014. He was survived by his wife Freya, his daughter, Michelle, sons Michael and Richard, and brother Roger.

The initial decline lasted from mid-1929 to mid-1931. During this time, most people believed that the decline was merely a bad recession, worse than the recessions that occurred in 1923 and 1927, but not as bad as the Depression of 1920-21. Economic forecasters throughout 1930 optimistically predicted an economic rebound come 1931, and felt vindicated by a stock market rally in the spring of 1930.Piers Brendon, The Dark Valley: A Panorama of the 1930s (2000) comprehensive global history. The stock market crash in the first few weeks had a limited direct effect on the broader economy, as only 16% of the U.S. population was invested in the market in any form. But thousands of investors and banks lost money when 10% of invested wealth was lost almost overnight, with prospect of further losses. The crash created uncertainty in people‚Äôs minds about the future of the economy. This distrust in future income reduced consumption expenditure. As demand for commodities decreased, so did their prices. However, many banks that had engaged in risky investments in the stock market, and/or had lent money to individuals engaged in trading, suffered balance sheet losses that reduced their capital ratios. Mounting losses from further stock market declines and a worsening macro-economy would further strain the banking system. Over $34 million in wealth would be lost from the collapses in leverage investment products in 1929 offered by Goldman Sachs alone. An increasing number of bank failures in late-1930 interrupted the process of credit creation and reduced the money supply, harming consumption. After a second round of banking panics in mid-1931, there was a major change in people‚Äôs expectations about the future of the economy.Temin, Peter. Lessons from The Great Depression, Cambridge:MIT Press, 1989. . This fear of reduced future income coupled with the Fed‚Äôs deflationary monetary policy resulted in a deflationary spiral that cratered consumer spending, business investment, and industrial production. This further depressed the economy until Roosevelt stepped into office in 1933 and ended the gold standard, thereby ending the deflationary policy.Bernanke, Ben S. The Federal Reserve Board. 2 March 2004.\\"Remarks by Governor Ben S. Bernanke.\\" A true understanding of the Great Depression requires not only knowledge of the U.S. monetary system but also the implications of the gold standard on its participatory nations. The gold standard made the involved nations interdependent on each other's policies. Due to a fixed exchange rate, the only way to affect the demand for gold was through interest rates. For example, if interest rates were high in one country, then investors would have no reason to exchange currency for gold and the gold reserves would remain stable. However, if interest rates were low in a different country then its investors would elect to move their funds abroad where interest rates were higher. In order to stop this from happening, each nation within the gold standard union had no choice but to raise its interest rates in correspondence with its fellow nation. This interconnectivity of deflationary policy amongst so many nations resulted in the prolongation of the greatest economic downturn.Charles P. Kindleberger, The World in Depression, 1929‚Äì1939 (3rd ed. 2013) This article focuses on the economic milestones, with some mention of the political and social impact of the depression on nations and classes in a global context. 1929 January - June: the Roaring Twenties continue unabated. The combined net profits of 536 manufacturing and trading companies showed a 36.6% increase over the same period in 1928, with steel production leading the way. Retail sales, construction starts, and railroad revenues set record after record. Stocks continue to make record gains. An enormous surplus of wheat from 1928 drives down wheat prices, straining commodity markets and farmers' incomes. Unemployment hovers around a robust 4%. US nominal GDP is $105 billion (it would not reach this level again until 1941). March 25th: a mini-stock market crash occurs after the Federal Reserve warns of excessive speculation. However, the mini-crash was averted two days later when National City Bank pumped $25 million in credit into the stock market. Summer: Consumer spending and industrial production begin to stagnate. The Federal Reserve continues with its plan to raise interest rates from 4% in mid-1928 to 6% by mid-1929 in an attempt to combat speculative behavior. June 15th: the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1929 is signed into law, providing some $100 million in emergency loans to struggling farmers May-September: The stock market makes almost entirely uninterrupted gains, gaining 20% over this period. August: a minor recession begins, two months before the Stock Market Crash. Steel production and automobile & house sales notably decline, construction stagnates, and consumer debt was reaching dangerous levels on account of easy credit. Over $8.5 billion of margin loans for stocks were outstanding, worth more than all currency circulating in the United States at the time. September 3rd: The Dow Jones Industrial Average peaks at 381.17. The stock market would not regain this peak until November 23rd, 1954. September 20th: The London Stock Exchange crashes after the collapse of Hatry Group on charges of fraud and forgery. ¬£24 million in value is wiped out. The collapse shakes the confidence of American investors in the security of overseas investments. October 24th: Wall Street Crash of 1929 begins. Stocks lose over 11% of their value upon the opening bell. October 25th - 27th: Brief recovery on the market. October 29th: 'Black Tuesday'. The New York Stock Exchange collapses, the Dow Jones closing down over 12%. October 30th: one day recovery November 1st: The Federal Reserve begins lowering the discount rate from its 6% level. November 13th: The stock market bottoms out at 198.60, followed by a bear market that would last until April 1930. Commodity prices, however, continue to decline steeply. 1930 Year: recession deepens. US GDP contracts by 8.5% and nominal GDP falls to $92 billion. Prices decline slightly but wages hold relatively steady. US annual inflation rate is -6.4%. Unemployment reaches 9%. 1,350 banks fail. April 17th: Dow reaches a secondary closing peak (i.e., bear market rally) of 294.07, followed by a long stagnation until a severe decline began in April 1931. This peak matches early-1929 levels, but is 30% below the September 1929 peak. May: Automobile sales fall below 1928 levels. June 17th: Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act passed, placing more stress on the weakening global economy, primarily through the collapse in trade of agricultural products, which strained banks that had lent heavily to farmers. Further decreases in trade of manufactured products led to layoffs and reduced corporate profits, weakening the economy. General consensus among economists is that the Smoot- Hawley Act did not cause the Depression, but did worsen it and stunted recovery efforts after 1933. Exports declined from $5.2 billion in 1929 to just $1.7 billion in 1933. September - December: First major round of U.S. bank failures. Some $550 million in deposits are lost. Over 300 banks failed in December alone. November: Caldwell & Company, a major conglomerate offering banking, insurance, and brokerage services in the Southern United States, collapses and triggered a cascading effect of bank runs on smaller banks in Tennessee and Kentucky. The collapse generates national headlines, contributing to the contagion of fear regarding the banking system. December: The Federal Reserve's federal funds rate reaches 2%, a then-record low. December: Bank of United States (a private bank in New York City) collapses. The bank had over $160 million in deposits and was the fourth largest bank in the United States at the time, and its failure is widely considered to be the moment when the banking collapse in the United States hit a critical mass, sparking a nationwide run on the banking system that was a major contributor to the deflationary spiral of 1931-1933. 1931 Depression-era Chicago, Illinois, the US, 1931.upright=1.15 Year: 2,294 banks went down with nearly $1.7 billion in deposits. 28,285 businesses failed for a daily rate of 133 failures in 1931. Unemployment rises to 16%. US nominal GDP falls to $77 billion, and growth is -8.5%. Annual inflation is -9.3%. May 11th: Creditanstalt, Austria's premier bank with major stakes across a variety of industries, becomes insolvent after being forced to assume liabilities from three other insolvent banks, triggering a cascading effect of bank failures across Central Europe. Creditanstalt represented 16% of Austria's GDP, and could not find another institution to guarantee liquidity. 140 million Austrian schillings were lost. The collapse of Creditanstalt caused the Bank of France, the National Bank of Belgium, the Netherlands Bank, and the Swiss National Bank to begin a run on the U.S. dollar for their gold reserves, and forced the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates from 1.5% to 3.5% to maintain the gold standards, which in turn contributed to the deepening of the Depression and the second round of banking failures in the U.S. during the summer of 1931. May: The Federal Reserve's federal funds rate bottoms out at 1.5%. May‚ÄìJune: Second major round of U.S. bank failures and worsening economic situation contributes to permanent change in people's expectation of the economy. This run was centered on bank in Chicago, which suffered from real estate loan defaults. Of the 193 state-chartered banks in the Chicago area in 1929, only 35 would survive to the end of 1933. Chicago area banks engaged heavily in real estate lending between 1923 and 1929, and banks that had greater exposure to the real estate bust were very likely to fail. The deflationary spiral that began earlier in the year rapidly and severely intensifies June-July: German banking crisis. The Reichsbank loses 840 million marks in less than 3 weeks as investors pull out short-term deposits. Germany's second largest bank, Danatbank, becomes insolvent on July 13th. Two day bank holiday is declared. Industry suffers a catastrophic collapse. The Hoover Moratorium is issued June 20th, suspending reparation payments from Germany to stabilize the country. Although private banks in New York City and the Bank of England begin emergency lending to Germany, the banking crisis spills over into Hungary and Romania, and the collapse of the economy paves the way for Adolf Hitler's rise in the July 1932 and March 1933 German federal elections. The contagion also puts increasing pressure on the United Kingdom. August - Deepening deficits and demands for a balanced budget lead to Ramsay MacDonald's Labour government raising taxes by ¬£24 million and cutting spending by ¬£96 million, most controversial was the 20% cut to unemployment benefits (a sum of ¬£64 million). The U.K.'s public debt at the time was 180% of GDP, mostly left over from the expenses of World War I. Public outrage would lead to the Labour Party being virtually destroyed in the October 1931 election. September 21st: Britain leaves the gold standard, and the pound sterling depreciates by 25%. Despite warning of disaster, the departure proves beneficial to the British economy, as exports become more competitive. Additionally, the Bank of England was now free to engage in money creation, and reduced interest rates from 6.00% to 2.00%. October 27th: the United Kingdom General election, 1931 takes place, destroying the Labour Party and delivering a landslide victory to the Conservative Party. September - October: Substantial amount of dollar assets (primarily Federal Reserve Notes) are converted to gold in the US by European central banks seeking to cover losses from the panic that had been sweeping Europe since the collapse of CreditAnstalt. In response, the Federal Reserve increases the federal funds rate from 1.50% to 3.50% to stabilize the dollar, but this only worsens the Depression as banks are further strained. The New York Federal Reserve Bank had loaned $150 million in gold (some 240 tons) to European central banks, and the wisdom of this was questioned as European countries rapidly abandoned the gold standard. As deflation intensified, real interest rates were magnified and rewarded those who held onto money, thus contributing to the deflationary spiral. 1932 Year: Unemployment rises to 23%, GDP growth is -13%, annual inflation rate is -11%, 1,700 banks fail. US nominal GDP falls to $60 billion. Over 13 million in the U.S. are unemployed and 3.5 million in the U.K. January 22nd - the Reconstruction Finance Corporation is created to lend $2 billion to troubled financial institutions that were not part of the Federal Reserve System that were solvent in the long-run. By 1941, the RFC would lend out some $9.5 billion to banks, railroads, and mortgage associations, as well as state and local governments. April - June: Federal Reserve conducts open market transactions, increasing the money supply by $1 billion. Summer 1932: Majority of foreign trade restrictions take effect, from Smoot-Hawley in the United States and Imperial Preference in the British Empire. June 6th - The Revenue Act of 1932 is signed into law, raising taxes on personal income, corporate income, and sales taxes on various goods. July: U.S. government discontinues open market operations. July 8th: The Dow Jones Industrial Index bottoms out at 41.22, the lowest level recorded in the 20th century and representing an 89% loss from its peak in September 1929. July 31st: The German federal election, July 1932 is held, and the Nazi Party, led by Adolf Hitler, becomes the largest party in the Reichstag (but lacks a majority) November 6th: The German federal election, November 1932, the last free and fair all-German election until 1990, is held. A minor setback for the Nazi Party, a campaign of mass violence and intimidation would begin in the run up to the next election in March 1933. Hitler is later appointed Chancellor of Germany by President Paul von Hindenburg, and would use the Reichstag fire as a pretext to declare a state of emergency in Germany expanding his powers. November 8th: 1932 United States elections: Franklin D. Roosevelt elected 32nd President of the United States in a landslide, the Democratic Party wins massive majorities in both chambers of Congress. 1933 Year: The inflation rate turns positive, at 1% annually. Quarterly GDP growth turns positive by summer, but overall annual rate is -1.3% growth. Unemployment peaks at 25%. 2 million are homeless. Industrial production is half of what it was in 1929. US nominal GDP bottoms out at $57 billion (down from $105 billion in 1929) February 14th: Michigan becomes the first state in the U.S. to declare an indefinite bank holiday, in an attempt to stem the impending collapse of First National Bank of Detroit and the Guardian National Bank of Commerce, the two largest banks in Detroit. First National and Guardian National were threatened with failure if the Ford Motor Company made good on its desire to withdraw all of its deposits in the two banks; Ford needed the cash to cover its $75 million loss in 1932. At this time, over 80% of Detroit's manufacturing capacity laid idle, and over 400,000 people were unemployed. Michigan's bank holiday set off a contagion of fear across the country, and by March 6th an additional 37 states would declare indefinite bank holidays. March 4th: Franklin D. Roosevelt is inaugurated as President. March 5th - The German federal election, March 1933 is held. The Nazi Party would win a narrow majority of seats, though only in coalition with the German National People's Party (DNVP). Though this would be the last free election before World War II, it is not considered to be a fair election, as the Nazi Party's paramilitary organizations waged a campaign of violence, censorship, intimidation, and harassment against all parties that opposed them with state support. Surveillance of voting was conducted on the day of the election itself. March 6th - Executive Order 2009 suspends all banking activity for one week, in response to renewed stress on major New York City banks that threatened another round of bank failures and further deepening of the Depression. By this time, 38 states had declared bank holidays. March 9th- The Emergency Banking Act was enacted, which enabled a restructuring of the banking system. Over 4,000 banks with $3.6 billion in deposits that were deemed irreparably insolvent were closed forever, but by March 15th, banks controlling some 90% of the nation's banking activities were back in business. By the end of March, over $1.1 billion in hoarded cash was deposited into the banking system. These new deposits saved cash-starved banks and helped restart the money creation process after years of credit contraction. The Act also created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which insured deposits up to $2,500 and helped restore confidence in the banking system. March 20th - The controversial Economy Act of 1933 is signed into law, slashing $243 million in government salaries and pensions, and veterans' benefits. Despite the economic crisis, supermajorities of American economists, policymakers, and the general public believed that the federal government needed to balance the budget and avoid deficit spending, to avoid putting further strain on the bond market which would negatively affect government borrowing costs, banks, corporations, and foreign investors. From 1929 to 1933, the total debt owed by the U.S. government rose from $16.9 billion to over $23 billion. This \\"Economy\\" Act was designed to reduce government outlays and assuage fears about government debt and deficits. March 31st - The Civilian Conservation Corps, a public works relief program, is created. It would last until 1942 and is an icon of the New Deal programs. April 5th - Executive Order 6102 of President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued, forbidding hoarding of gold coin, bullion, and certificates, effective from May 1, 1933 May 12th - the Agricultural Adjustment Act is enacted, designed to boost agricultural prices by reducing surpluses. May 27th - the Securities Act of 1933 is enacted, requiring the registration of all sales and purchases of financial securities, as well as the disclosure of critical financial information about the firms involved. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was established the following year, which helped combat insider trading and reducing transaction risk. July - Federal Reserve industrial production index rebounds to 85.5, a 57% increase over the 54.3 recorded in March 1933 November 8th - the Civil Works Administration is created, which would employ over 4 million people and distribute over $400 million in funds for work programs through its end on March 31, 1934, when it would be replaced by the more permanent Works Progress Administration December 5th - Prohibition is repealed at the national level. 18 states continue with state-level prohibition. The end of Prohibition hurts organized crime, allows legal employment in alcoholic drink production, and increases state tax revenues.

Only four of the series‚Äô five seasons on the network included new episodes; the 1953‚Äì54 season consisted entirely of reruns. Synopsis The series stars Stuart Erwin and real-life wife June Collyer. Ann E. Todd and Sheila James portray the couple's fictional daughters (Merry Anders replaced Ann Todd in the final season). One notable aspect of the show was that it featured a black actor Willie Best in a regular supporting role. Predating modern single-camera sitcoms, The Stu Erwin Show originally aired without a laugh track (one was added in its final season), and each episode was around 26 minutes long, without commercials. During its original network run on ABC, it was sponsored by General Mills (1950‚Äì54), Paper Mate (1953-'54) and Liggett & Myers (1954‚Äì55). Production The series was produced by Roland D. Reed and Hal Roach, Jr., and filmed at Hal Roach Studios in Culver City, California. All 52 episodes of season one were first- run, followed by another 26 in season two for a total of 78 straight weeks of all-new shows before reruns began in the spring of 1952. Another 26 episodes were produced for the 1952‚Äì53 season, interspersed with reruns every third week between October 1952 and July 1953. Production then went on a lengthy hiatus while the network continued airing reruns from the summer of 1953 until the fall of 1954. The fourth and final season's 26 episodes aired between October 1954 and April 1955.

Recently the museum bought the old Lodge Hotel and the Brighton Block located at 9670 Jasper Avenue. The goal is to develop in order to create a facility which will house exhibition galleries, an archive and library resource area, collection storage areas, educational, meeting and special programming areas.Our Present The museum's vision states a number of aspects where growth is expected: creating an opportunity for exploring Ukrainian heritage, enriching the collection of the museum with respect of acquisition policies, transferring the collection to a more up-to-date building and expanding not only the permanent, but also the traveling collection of artifacts that the museum possesses. History Ukrainians are one of the Canadian Prairie Provinces' largest ethnic groups. In recognition of this legacy, in 1972, a group of eleven members of the Ukrainian community in Edmonton, led by Hryhory and Stefania Yopyk, decided to establish a facility for the preservation of the history and culture of Canadians of Ukrainian heritage.Our Past The official opening date of the museum is 27 October 1974. In 2003, the museum acquired the Lodge Hotel and the Brighton Block on Jasper Avenue, and obtained C$9.2 million from the city, province and federal government for a C$13 million renovation. This location has always had close ties with the Ukrainian community, as it was a home for many Ukrainian businesses in the area. Construction began in 2012. Since then, renovation costs have increased to C$22 million. To raise money, the museum plans to sell the Brighton Block to pay for development of the museum in the former Hotel. Ken Cantor and Primavera Development Group have agreed to purchase the property, dependent upon the city allowing him to make specific changes to the building, which is a protected municipal historic resource.  Collection of the museum  Mr. Yopyk started working on the collection in the mid 1960s. His initial approach was contacting the local Ukrainian newspaper and publishing an article that encouraged other Ukrainians to donate books, personal belongings and other printed material. The collection started expanding and Mr. Yopyk started traveling around Alberta on the weekends to meet with the people who were willing to donate things for his archives. Hryhory also carried the camera with him, as he enjoyed taking photographs of the churches in rural Alberta. At first, Mr. Yopyk kept the collection at home, but as he was expanding the archives, he initially ran out of space and that is when he developed the idea about creating a whole museum out of something he simply enjoyed doing.

The votes violate Sessoms' promise not to let his duties to the bank conflict with his public obligations, and some may also violate state law.\\" John Holland, writing for the newspaper, said \\"a review of some 3,000 court, land and council records showed a pattern of such votes spanning his nearly six years in office.\\" Subsequently, Virginia Beach councilman John Moss said \\"what the newspaper reported makes a prima facie case against the mayor, and that isn't going to just go away,\\" adding \\"law enforcement officials must investigate whether Mayor Will Sessoms broke the law.\\" On November 11, 2014, on returning from an international trip, Sessoms issued a statement saying \\"I have been made aware of the recent stories and am taking this situation and these allegations seriously.\\" Sessoms was subsequently suspended (with pay) by the bank, pending an investigation. On the following day, the City of Virginia Beach Commonwealth's Attorney asked for a special prosecutor investigation if Sessoms broke laws by casting council votes in favor of bank clients. The mayors of the neighboring cities of Norfolk and Suffolk, Paul D. Fraim and Linda Johnson, resigned their directorships at TowneBank on November 13, to \\"eliminate any perception of a conflict of interest and is not suggestive that any conflict exists.\\" A day later, Sessoms resigned his positions on TowneBank boards. On December 24, 2014, Sessoms resigned from TowneBank, in accordance with a new policy prohibiting senior bank management from holding elective office. On November 4, 2015, Sessoms was charged with five misdemeanor counts of violating the state's Conflict of Interest Act for votes he cast that benefited borrowers of TowneBank. A trial date was tentatively set for December 7, 2015. On December 3, 2015, it was reported that the trial had been delayed to December 28 as none of the General District Court judges in Virginia Beach would hear the case citing the potential for conflict of interest as Sessoms was still mayor. On December 28, 2015, Sessoms pleaded no contest to a single misdemeanor charge of violating the state's Conflict of Interest Act. As part of a plea agreement offered by the special prosecutor, the four other charges he faced were dropped. Personal life Married to his wife Beverly since 1977, the Sessoms have three children, Mollie S. Korte, Kate S. Napolitano, and Anne Douglas Gangwer. His father-in-law is Roy B. Martin Jr., former mayor of Norfolk, Virginia. Sessoms earned a Bachelor of Business Administration from Virginia Commonwealth University. Until September 1988, he was a member of the board of directors of the Princess Anne Country Club, which was at the time an integration target by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Early in his political career his membership in the allegedly discriminatory country club and his children's attendance at the private Norfolk Academy were deemed elitist by his political opponents.

Built in the 9th century, it served as a sanctuary.Davison, J. et al. (2003) History Although the exact origins of the cave are uncertain, it is believed to have been built as place for spiritual meditation. One folklore relates that it was created by the fingernail of the legendary giant Kebo Iwa. However, examining its style, the sanctuary was probably dated from the 11th century Bali Kingdom. The complex contains both Hindu and Buddhist imagery, as the cave contains lingam and yoni, symbol of Shiva, and the image of Ganesha, while by the river there are carved images of stupas and chattra, imagery of Buddhism. The cave was rediscovered by Dutch archaeologists in 1923, but the fountains and bathing pool were not discovered until 1954. Site description The temple is characterised by menacing faces that are carved into the stone ‚Äì whose purpose is assumed to be the warding off of evil spirits. The primary figure was once thought to be an elephant, hence the nickname Elephant Cave. Other sources state that it is named after the stone statue of the Hindu God Ganesh (characterised by having the head of an elephant) located inside of the temple. The site is mentioned in the Javanese poem Desawarnana written in 1365. An extensive bathing place on the site was not excavated until the 1950s.Pringle, R. (2004) p 61 The entrance of the cave is accessed only by walking down a long flight of stairs. The inside of the temple is small and usually has trails of white smoke from the incense burning. Visitors wearing shorts will be issued a sarong to tie around the waist before entering the courtyard. The complex also contains 7 statues of women (out of which 1 has been destroyed due to an earthquake) holding water pitchers that depicts seven holy rivers of India: the Ganga River, Sarasvati River, Yamuna River, Godavari River, Sindhu River, Kaveri River, and Narmada River.

Based in New York City, John is the founder of The Shark Group. Early life John was born February 23, 1969 in Brooklyn, New York City, but grew up in the Queens neighborhood of Hollis. He began working at the age of 10, when his parents divorced; one early job entailed handing out flyers for $2 an hour. In high school, he participated in a program that allowed him to work a full-time job and attend school on an alternating weekly basis, which he credits with instilling an entrepreneurial spirit. After graduating high school, he started a commuter van service and waited tables at Red Lobster. CareerFUBU= John started FUBU in his mother's house in Hollis, Queens. When John first had the idea for a clothing company for young men, his mother taught him how to sew and supported him by allowing her house to be taken over to grow the business. Wool ski hats with their tops tied off with fishing line were popular, and John noticed them being sold for $20, which he considered overpriced.Kaufman, Leslie. Trying to Stay True to the Streets. The New York Times. March 14, 1999. He went home and sewed around 90 hats with his next-door neighbor.Daymond John: Streets Ahead of the Rest. The Independent. July 18, 2002. They sold their homemade hats for $10 each on the corner of Jamaica Avenue and made $800 in a single day in 1992. After the hats, they began selling screen-printed T-shirts. To break into the market, they sold on consignment and at large events around the Northeast. To make ends meet, John held a full-time job at Red Lobster, working on the FUBU business in between shifts.Ferriss, Tim. The Making of Fubu - An Interview with Daymond John The 4-Hour Workweek Blog. April 7, 2011. Sensing potential, John and his mother mortgaged their house for $100,000 to generate start-up capital. In addition to Brown, he recruited longtime friends J. Alexander Martin and Keith Perrin into the business, and began sewing the FUBU logo onto hockey jerseys, sweatshirts, and T-shirts. They loaned about 10 of the hockey jerseys out to rappers for their music videos for 2 years and got product placements in about 30 videos. They were perceived as a large clothing brand, despite being a relatively small company and stores started requesting their brand. In 1993, he convinced LL Cool J, an old neighborhood friend, to wear a FUBU T-shirt for a promotional campaign.Webster, Nancy Colton. FUBU: Daymond John. Advertising Age. June 28, 1999.

They had to take out a second mortgage of his mother's house in order to fulfill the orders. After being turned down by 27 banks for a loan, his mother used the last of their money to take out an advertisement in the NY Times. As a result of the ad, FUBU made a deal with Samsung Textiles, allowing them to complete their orders. FUBU has earned over $6 billion in global sales.

Possibly built by Iskandar Muda, the grounds of the historical park contain a 17th Century palace, garden, and white circular structure whose purpose is unknown, the Gunongan, after which the park has been named.Eliot, J & Jane Bickersteth (2000) p 126 History The Gunungan Historical Park was then known as Taman Ghairah (Acehnese \\"pleasure garden\\"). According to ar-Raniri, a 17th-century Islamic mystic from Gujarat who worked several years for the Sultan, The garden was built by Iskandar Thani in mid 17th-century as part of the court of Aceh Sultanate; not different with Taman Sari to the Sultanate of Yogyakarta. It is possible that the garden has existed way before Iskandar Thani, as it is unlikely that the grand and spacious garden was built in its entirety during the five-year reign of Iskandar Thani. Several parks has existed in the vicinity of the Acehnese palace as mentioned in Hikayat Aceh, e.g. an older 16th-century garden built by the infamous Sultan Zayn al-Abidin. ar-Raniri, a 17th-century Islamic mystic from Gujarat who worked several years for the Sultan, describe the garden in elaborate detail. The garden is a walled royal pleasure garden about 1,000 fathom (1.82 km) wide. On the side leading towards the palace stood a gate known as Pintu Biram Indera Bangsa. Inside the garden were several structures e.g. the Gunongan, a mosque known as 'Isyqi Musyahadah, and a number of pavilions e.g. Balai Cermin Perang, Balai Rekaan Cina, Balai Keemasan, and Balai Kumbang Caya. Through the middle of the garden flowed a creek, named Dar al-'Ishqi, which flows north toward the Aceh River. Another structure in the garden was carved stone structures e.g. the Kembang Seroja Berkerawang and the Petarana Kembang Berukir. The garden was also embelisshed with a fountain in the shape of two dragons. Many kind of fruit trees were planted within the garden. Gunongan The Gunongan, then known as Gegunungan Menara Permata (\\"gunungan of jeweled tower\\") stood in the middle of a marbled square known as Medan Khairani. The Gunongan is basically a gunungan, a typical element of an Indonesian garden found in Java, Bali and Lombok; although there has been an argument that the garden was more similar to the Islamic Persian garden. It is possible that the Gunongan structure was older than the entire extend of the garden. According to Hikayat Malem Dagang and Hikayat Meukuta Alam, the Gunongan was built by Iskandar Muda for his Malay consort, the princess of Pahang. The Hikayat Malem Dagang recounts that two princes of the Malay Peninsula, Raja si Ujut and Raja Rad√©n, brought this lady, Putroe Phang, to Aceh. They sought a judgement from Sultan Iskandar Muda in a quarrel between them. Iskandar found in favor of Raja Rad√©n, and received from him Putroe Phang. For her relaxation he built the Gunongan, because she was homesick for the mountains of her native land.

San Diego State University Library and Information Access. 2009 (retrieved 27 Feb 2009) The tribe's reservation, the Upper Lake Rancheria, is large and located near the town of Upper Lake in northwestern California. History The Habematolel Pomo are indigenous to California's Clear Lake Basin. Artifacts made by early Native Americans in the Clear Lake Basin have been carbon-dated to 8,000 years ago, although tribal occupation probably extends back further in time. By 6,000 years ago the entire lake was used by tribes evenly settled around the lake shore.Clear Lake's First People. (pdf file) Habematolel Pomo of Upper Lake. (retrieved 27 Feb 2009) By 1800, Pomo population in California was an estimated to be 10,000-18,000 people, belonging to 70 different Pomo tribes and speaking seven different Pomo languages. The Habematolel Pomo, were some of the estimated 350 Northern Pomo. The Habematolel Pomo belong to the Northern and Eastern Pomo language groups, both of which are considered today to be extinct. Known for their extensive trade networks, the Habematolel Pomo traded magnesite and obsidian with the Coast Miwoks for a variety of shells. Pomo are known for their woven baskets and elaborate feather headdresses. The Bloody Island Massacre or Bonopoti occurred in 1850, on \\"Old Island\\", at the north end of Clear Lake. The 1st Dragoons US Cavalry slaughtered almost 200 Pomos, mostly women and children of the Clear Lake Pomo and neighboring tribes. In 1856, the Lake County Pomo were rounded up by the US military and forced to relocate onto the Nome Cult Indian Farm in Round Valley in northern Mendocino County. This later became the Round Valley Indian Reservation. Faced with the onslaught on non-Indian settlers in their homelands, four Pomo groups, the Danoxa, Kaiyo-Matuku, Xowalek, and Yobotui, pooled their resources and purchased of land in 1878 at Xabematolel. This community was called Habematolel in Upper Lake. In 1907, the US federal government created the Upper Lake Rancheria for the tribe on adjacent land. The reservation grew to be . As part of its Termination and Relocation Policy in the interest of assimilating Natives into mainstream society, the US government passed the California Rancheria Act of 1953. This law enabled the US to terminate relationships with the Habematolel Pomo and break up the lands of the Upper Lake Rancheria into individual allotments. The tribe responded with a lawsuit, Upper Lake Pomo Association v. James Watt, in 1975 saying that termination was an illegal policy. In 1980 the Bureau of Indian Affairs oversaw an election of a tribal council, who began drafting a new tribal constitution and bylaws. In 1983 the tribe won its federal court case and tribal recognition was restored in 1998, when a new council was elected. The current constitution was ratified in 2004. Today The tribe is federally recognized and has 191 enrolled members. The Habematolel Pomo operate their own housing, environmental, and educational programs, including computer classes and GED preparation. The tribe has been able to purchase land on its traditional territory, near the historical tribe village of Maiyi. The Habematolel Pomo are governed by an elected, seven-member tribal council.

It was first broadcast on 20 September 1976 on BBC 2, in a two-hour special, along with the second episode Family Affairs, and subsequent DVD and VHS releases put the two episodes together. It first aired at 9:00 pm and finished at 9:50, with the next episode straight after, and was later repeated on 25 September at 10:20 pm. Plot The story begins with an old Claudius in his study, just starting to write the 'strange' history of his family. Whilst he is writing he remembers a few years back when he heard the Sibyl's prophecy. She predicted he would get a position everybody but him wanted, that in 1900 years his history will be read and at long last Claudius will speak clearly. The story then returns to the old Claudius, who begins his family history with the rivalry between Marcus Agrippa and Marcellus. The year is 24BC and the Emperor Augustus is having celebrations for the seventh anniversary of the Battle of Actium. Marcellus - Augustus's son in law and nephew - does not think much of the battle and believes that people go on about it too much. Marcus Agrippa - who fought in the battle and is an old friend of Augustus - does not take kindly to his opinion and later leaves in a huff, after Marcellus makes a particularly biting comment. Later on Marcus Agrippa leaves Rome for the East, because he believes he is no longer any use where he is, although he denies his decision has anything to do with Marcellus and his popularity with the people of Rome, especially over him. Whilst Augustus is away on an inspection trip and Julia - Augustus's child from his first marriage and Marcellus's wife - and Octavia - Augustus's sister and Marcellus's mother - are away on holiday, Marcellus falls ill with stomach flu. Livia - Augustus's second wife - takes over as his nurse and starts cooking for him, citing the fact that she had earlier got Augustus better again from a previous, unseen illness. Marcellus, though only falls more ill and he dies, with the official diagnosis being food poisoning. His death results in a great public outcry in Rome and there are demonstrations and riots. Augustus is forced to recall Marcus Agrippa to help him govern. Agrippa agrees, as long as he can marry Julia, so he will be heir to Augustus, which is what he always wanted. This incenses Livia, as she wants her son Tiberius - from her previous marriage - to marry Julia, so he can become the next Emperor after Augustus has died.

The film documents the devastation and ruin brought on by the Second Chechen War, more specifically the toll that the war had taken on the children of Chechnya and Russia. The film received positive reviews from critics and won numerous awards. Content summary The content of The 3 Rooms of Melancholia is divided into three chapters, each chronicling different hardships of the affected children. The film is narrated by Pirkko Saisio but narration and dialogue are sparse and the imagery is left to convey the largest part of the film's message. =Chapter one: Longing= Kronstadt is a Russian town on Kotlin Island near Saint Petersburg. A site of the infamous Kronstadt rebellion, this is where the Armed forces of the Russian Federation run and maintain the Kronstadt Cadet Academy, a boys' military academy. The film documents a part of the months-long intense training program of several hundred children between the ages of nine and fourteen, most of whom are either orphaned or from very poor families. The viewers learn that many of these children are orphans because of the war in Chechnya and that some of the children will be sent to fight this very same war once their training is complete. Some of the children and their backgrounds are presented in-depth and a bleak picture emerges about their past and their possible future lives. The viewer is also led to believe that the future Russian Army will be largely composed of children such as these. The training is intense and devoid of any enjoyment for the children; the war exercises are strenuous and endless; the children don't get to play much but, even when they do, their games are also organized into war exercises; most of the television programming that the children watch is limited to news reports about wars and terrorist attacks. Bleak and somber imagery dominates throughout the first chapter, instilling images of poverty, despair and desolation affecting the children as well as their families. =Chapter two: Breathing= The second chapter is shot in black-and-white and depicts the devastation in the city of Grozny, the Chechen capital, brought on by years of endless fighting. Numerous buildings are destroyed by bombs and the city appears devoid of normal human life. As stray dogs rummage through the rubble, the only human activities within the city seem to be military movements, homeless people and beggars dying on the streets, and humanitarian workers trying to save the children. A woman is shown dying from having drunk water contaminated with oil. Hadizhat Gataeva, a Chechen woman and humanitarian worker who collects the abandoned children and those children of dead and dying parents, is shown caringly taking the woman's three young children from her in order to take them to an orphanage where they may receive the care they need after their mother dies. The children are loaded on a bus and taken on a long trip across a desolate landscape that bears constant reminders that they're still in a war zone‚Äîsuch as multiple military checkpoints‚Äîuntil they reach an Islamic orphanage located in the autonomous region of Ingushetia. =Chapter three: Remembering= The viewers are taken to the orphanage where some of the children are profiled. An 11-year-old boy was gang-raped by Russian soldiers and was brought to the orphanage after being found in a cardboard box. Another boy was brought in after he survived a fall from a ninth-floor apartment; his mother threw him off the balcony after her husband's death in the First Chechen War. A girl, now 19, was 12 years old when she was raped by Russian soldiers. The last few minutes of the film show a mysterious but ancient religious ceremony performed on a Muslim farm; a goat is killed‚Äîfor food as well as for the ceremony‚Äîand the children have its blood smeared on their faces. All of this happens while more reminders of the war present themselves as fighter aircraft fly overhead. ReceptionCritical response= The film received a generally positive response from film critics being awarded favorable reviews as well as winning eleven major film awards while being nominated for four more.

He is best remembered for his paintings, but he also wrote short fiction for Mormon periodicals,Crocker Art Museum Store accessed Feb. 27, 2009 and other works of musings and poetry. Early life Lambourne was born to William and Martha Wernham in Chieveley, Berkshire, England on the River Lambourn. The family emigrated to the United States when Alfred was a child. They first settled in St. Louis, Missouri before moving to Utah Territory.The Alfred Lambourne Pages accessed Feb. 27, 2009 Art and exploration Alfred's artistic talents were encouraged by his parents from an early age. During the trip from St. Louis to Salt Lake City, Utah, Alfred kept a sketchbook of scenery along the way. After arriving in Salt Lake City, Utah at the age of 16, Lambourne took work as a scenic artist for the Salt Lake Theatre. In 1871, he accompanied then-President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and former Governor of the Utah Territory, Brigham Young, to Zion Canyon and made the first sketches of the area. In the same decade, Lambourne traveled the American West with photographer Charles Roscoe Savage, painting as Savage photographed, and explored the Wasatch range with H. L. A. Culmer, painting and naming features, and \\"painted a series of large canvasses representing his journey from the eastern coast of the United States to the Golden Gate\\" with Reuben Kirkham. He also visited Yosemite, Colorado and Arizona. Later in life, Lambourne focused more on writing, sometimes illustrating his work, eventually writing 14 books. In November, 1895, he began a year living in solitude on Great Salt Lake's remote Gunnison Island, where he wrote Our Inland Sea. In March 1896, a group of guano sifters came to the island, and Lambourne included musings about them in the book. In early Winter of 1896, Lambourne left the island, along with the guano sifters.

In November 1992, Durousseau enlisted in the U.S. Army and was stationed in Germany, where he met Natoca, who would later become his wife. The two married in 1995 in Las Vegas. In 1996, they were transferred to Fort Benning, Georgia. On March 13, 1997, Durousseau was arrested for kidnapping and raping a young woman. However, in August of that year he was cleared of those charges. Soon after, he was found in possession of stolen goods. He was court-martialed in January 1999, found guilty and dishonorably discharged from the Army. Durousseau and his wife moved to Jacksonville, Florida, where they had two daughters. It was during that period that he committed most of the murders. He struggled to keep jobs to make ends meet, and the couple would often have fights over the issue of finances. In 1999, the police advised Durousseau's wife on how to file for a restraining order after he allegedly slapped her in the face and grabbed her by the neck. Later, she testified he got violently angry when she talked about getting a divorce. In September and October 2001, Durousseau spent 48 days in jail for domestic battery. Durousseau still managed to hold various legitimate jobs. In 2001, he was hired as a school bus driver and an animal control worker despite being a convicted felon. In 2003, he worked as a taxi driver and it is now accepted that this is how he first came into contact with some of his victims. It was erroneously reported that Gator City Taxi Company failed to run a background check on Durousseau; the City of Jacksonville was responsible for the background check, and issued Durousseau's taxi driver permit. Neighbors and friends described Durousseau as a \\"lewd womanizer\\". He often asked young women when they planned to \\"make flicks\\" with him. A witness recalled Durousseau hitting on a girl that appeared to be around 13 or 14 years old.  Chronology of the murders  Less than one month after the acquittal over the rape charges, the nude body of 26-year-old Tracy Habersham was found on September 7, 1997 in Fort Benning. She had been missing for 48 hours and was last seen leaving a party. She had been raped and strangled to death with a cord. Durousseau was not a suspect in the murder, but DNA would later tie him to the crime. He later confessed to Habersham's killing after his arrest. In 1999, Durousseau raped and killed 24-year-old Tyresa Mack in her apartment. Witnesses saw him leave her place carrying a television. In 2001, he was arrested for raping a young woman in Jacksonville. He spent 30 days in jail and received two years' probation. On December 19, 2002, 18-year-old Nicole L. Williams' body was found wrapped in a blue blanket at the bottom of a ditch in Jacksonville. She had been reported missing two days earlier. On January 1, 2003, family members of 19-year-old Nikia Kilpatrick went to check on her. They had not had any news from her for several days. They found her body in the bedroom of her apartment. She had been raped then killed by strangulation with a cord two days before. Her two sons, an eleven-month-old and a two-year- old, were alive but malnourished. Kilpatrick was approximately six months pregnant at the time of her death. Eight days later, 20-year-old nurse assistant Shawanda Denise McCalister, who was also pregnant at the time of her death, was raped and strangled in her Jacksonville apartment. The murder scene was almost identical to that of Kilpatrick. She was killed on Durousseau's first day of driving a cab for Gator City Taxi. Her body was found the following day. The next two victims were 17-year-old Jovanna Jefferson, and 19-year-old Surita Cohen. Their bodies were found close to each other in a ditch next to a construction site on New Kings Road in Jacksonville on February 5. Police estimated that Jefferson was murdered around January 20 and Cohen was killed 10 days later. Witnesses recount having seen the two last victims with a taxi driver fitting Paul Durousseau's description on the night they disappeared. Durousseau was arrested and charged with five counts of murder on June 17, 2003. On December 13, 2007 he was sentenced to death by lethal injection for the murder of Tyresa Mack. As of August 18, 2013, he was still a resident on Florida's death row at Union Correctional Institution. In January 2017, Durousseau's death sentence was overturned by the Florida Supreme Court. The jury that sentenced Dorousseau was split 10-2 and the high court declared a split decision unconstitutional in capital sentencing See also * List of death row inmates in the United States * List of serial killers in the United States References Category:1970 births Category:Living people Category:African-American people Category:American rapists Category:American serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American prisoners sentenced to death Category:Military personnel from Texas Category:Prisoners sentenced to death by Florida Category:People from Beaumont, Texas Category:People from Jacksonville, Florida Category:People convicted of murder by Florida Category:United States Army soldiers Category:1997 murders in the United States Category:20th-century American criminals Category:21st-century American criminals Category:1991 crimes in the United States Category:Criminals from Texas Category:American taxicab drivers Category:Bus drivers ","title":"Paul Durousseau"},{"id":"21735857","text":"Otto Stoll 1849-1922) Otto Stoll (29 December 1849 in Frauenfeld - 18 August 1922 in Z√ºrich) was a Swiss linguist and ethnologist.

Shrub swamps ‚Äî also called scrub swamps or buttonbush swamps ‚Äî are a type of freshwater wetland ecosystem occurring in areas too wet to become swamps (‚Äútrue‚Äù or freshwater swamp forest), but too dry or too shallow to become marshes. They are often considered transitional (‚Äúmid-successional‚Äù) between wet meadows or fens and conifer or hardwood swamps. By some classifications, shrub swamps must have at least 50% shrub cover and less than 20% tree cover. Other definitions specify large shrubs with small trees less than in height. Creation of shrub swamps often follows a catastrophic event in a forested swamp (flood, cutting, fire, or windstorm). Another route of development is via drained meadows and fens which progress to shrub swamps as a transitional state to forested swamps. Development As a wet meadow matures it begins to fill in with vegetation and as this decomposes the soil thickens creating high spots (hummocks) above the water. Shrubs and small trees begin to grow on these. Shrub swamp water comes from run-off, streams and rivers and the water moves in and out of the swamp throughout the year. Consequently, they tend to be drier than wet meadows or forested swamps and permit water intolerant plant species to grow on the hummocks. Shrub swamps typically occur on organic soils, such as muck and shallow peat soils. Common plants found in the shrub swamps of North America include alders, willows, elderberry and highbush blueberry.

He was the head coach of FC Midtjylland from 2009 to 2011. He is also a former assistant coach and caretaker head coach of Aalborg BK, and was the assistant of head coach Erik Hamr√©n in the 2008 Superliga-winning season, as well as assistant of Kent Nielsen in the 2014 Superliga-winning season. In his active career, Kuhn was known as a hard-working attacking midfielder. He played a total 204 games for Lyngby Boldklub, winning the 1990 Danish Cup trophy and the 1992 Superliga championship with the club. He also played for Danish clubs Boldklubben 1903 and Hvidovre IF, and won the 2000 Swedish Cup with √ñrgryte IS. He represented the Denmark national under-19 football team five times. Playing career Born on Bornholm, Kuhn started his playing career with local team R√∏nne IK. While at R√∏nne IK, he made his international debut as a forward when he played five games and scored two goals for the Denmark national under-19 football team in 1985. He got his senior debut for R√∏nne IK in 1987, and was soon off to Copenhagen club Lyngby Boldklub in the Danish 1st Division. He also played for 1st Division rivals Boldklubben 1903, before getting his national breakthrough when he moved back to Lyngby BK in 1990, playing alongside his older brother Hasse Kuhn. =Lyngby Boldklub= During his second stint with Lyngby, he helped the team win the 1990 Danish Cup against AGF.POKAL 1989/1990 ‚Äì FINALE at Haslund.info He did not score in the 6‚Äì1 final win, but was hailed as one of the best players of the game, alongside later Danish international midfielders Morten Wieghorst and Peter Nielsen.Vagn Erlandsen, \\"Lyngby triumferede i sand opvisningsstil\\", Berlingske Tidende, 1 June 1990, p.6 In a September 1990 game against Vejle Boldklub, Allan was sent off when he pushed a Vejle player who had elbowed and knocked out several of Hasse Kuhn's teeth without any reprimand from the referee.\\"Nej til video ved strafudm√•ling\\", Berlingske Tidende, 24 September 1990, p.5 Allan underwent surgery in the summer 1991 to mend a right knee injury,Vagn Erlandsen, \\"H√¶ngepartier i klubberne\\", Berlingske Tidende, 22 July 1991, p.6 and only played six of 32 games as Lyngby won the 1991‚Äì92 Superliga championship under manager Kent Karlsson.

In the fall of 2008, Allan Kuhn was appointed caretaker head coach for AaB, after new head coach Bruce Rioch was sacked on 23 October 2008. In this period, Kuhn guided the team to a third-place finish in the 2008‚Äì09 UEFA Champions League group E, ahead of Celtic, through a series of successful matches including a win over Celtic and a tie with Manchester United on Old Trafford. He also led AaB from 11th to 6th place in the league, as he was undefeated in his seven Superliga games as head coach. Kuhn expressed the desire to continue as AaB head coach, but AaB sports director Lynge Jakobsen saw a risk in the transition in role from assistant to head coach, as the players were too used to see Kuhn in the assistant role. From January 2009, he returned to his old position as assistant coach, now with Magnus Pehrsson as new AaB head coach. It was later revealed, that Kuhn engaged in advanced talks to replace Ove Christensen as head coach at Superliga rivals Vejle Boldklub, but eventually declined the offer. =FC Midtjylland= In August 2009, Kuhn was named new head coach at Superliga rivals FC Midtjylland (FCM). He replaced Thomas Thomasberg as head coach, who was fired following four points in the first four games of the 2009-10 Danish Superliga season. FCM lost the first four games of Kuhn's reign, but rallied to eventually finish the season in fifth place. In the 2010-11 Danish Superliga, FCM was second placed following the first half of the season. In the 2010 winter break, FCM sports director Jens √òrgaard decided that all FCM teams should play the same offensive possession-based game, from youth teams to the Superliga team, in order to ease the integration of youth players into the first team squad. In March and April 2011, FCM went five games without winning. Kuhn announced his decision to leave the club prematurely on 15 April 2011, as he found the work load of a head coach was incompatible with his family life. On 26 April 2011, he was contracted as an assistant coach of Superliga rivals Randers FC for the remainder of the 2010-11 season, working under new head coach Peter Elstrup. =Back to Aalborg BK= From 2011 to 2016 he was once again the assistant coach of AaB, and was part of the 2014 Double Winning AaB-team which won both the Danish Superliga and the Danish Cup. =Malm√∂ FF= On 8 January 2016, Kuhn was announced as the head coach for Swedish Malm√∂ FF. He replaced √Öge Hareide, who took Malm√∂ FF to two straight UEFA Champions League group stages before leaving to be manager of Denmark national football team.

The Institute promotes ethical reflection and engagement through its research, education and practice in five core areas: Human Rights, Global Migration, Rethinking Regulation, Moral Attitudes and Decision-Making, and Religions and Public Life. A small sampling of current projects includes an intensive semester-long undergraduate program on forced migration, a new laboratory on moral decision-making, a practitioner-in-residence program, a partnership with a U.N. working group on business and human rights, and a new initiative exploring how faith, citizenship, and the law intersect with processes of globalization. History The Kenan Institute for Ethics at Duke University began as the Kenan Ethics Program in the fall of 1995 with a five-year grant from the William R. Kenan, Jr. Fund for Ethics. It was established in response to philanthropist Frank Hawkins Kenan‚Äôs concern about what he perceived to be an increasing lack of ethical standards in public affairs and in business life. Mr. Kenan, then a trustee of the William R. Kenan, Jr. Charitable Trust and trustee of the Duke Endowment, and then-Duke President Nannerl Keohane sought to establish a university-based ethics program that would permeate the life of the university and extend into the life of the community and nation. In July 1999, the William R. Kenan, Jr. Charitable Trust established a $10 million endowment managed by the William R. Kenan, Jr. Fund for Ethics, thus committing itself to long-term support. The Kenan Ethics Program then became the Kenan Institute for Ethics, and over time, the trustees of the William R. Kenan, Jr. Charitable Trust built the endowment to $20 million. The Institute celebrated its new status in January 2001. Elizabeth Kiss was Director from 1996 to 2006, leaving Duke to become President of Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, in August 2006. After a national search, Provost Peter Lange appointed Noah Pickus as the Institute‚Äôs new Director in July 2007. Professor Pickus was reappointed to another five-year term in July 2012. Professor Suzanne Shanahan, who was appointed Associate Director in 2007, was also reappointed to another five-year term in 2012. In 2017, Shanahan was named director when Pickus accepted a position as dean of curriculum and faculty development at Duke Kunshan University. Since its founding, the Institute has grown into one of the most active and respected ethics centers in the country. At Duke, the Institute has played a leadership role in the university‚Äôs engagement with ethics, contributing to a focus on academic integrity (including an honor code and code signing ceremony); the establishment of a two-course Ethical Inquiry requirement for undergraduates; the implementation of a research ethics requirement for all Ph.D. students (a national first); the launch of a research service-learning initiative that is now institutionalized as DukeEngage; the creation of ethics training for all students in the DukeEngage program; and the launch of an undergraduate certificate program in ethics. The Institute also established a graduate fellows program; started a regular DukeImmerse trip; ran the third Winter Forum; launched a FOCUS cluster; and hired three faculty jointly with Trinity College.http://kenan.ethics.duke.edu/about/the-institute/ Duke Immerse: Uprooted/Rerouted Duke Immerse is a program unique to Duke University that allows an individual Duke department to receive funding for an intensive semester of study of their area of expertise with a select group of students. Funding allows the opportunity for international travel for students to gain a deeper understanding of the subject matter. In the spring semester of 2012, the Kenan Institute for Ethics launched their version of DukeImmerse entitled Uprooted/Rerouted. The program selected twelve students and was taught by five professors. Duke Immerse: Uprooted/Rerouted focused entirely on the issue of forced migration, particularly on the clandestine experience of UNHCR registered refugees navigating the complex world of international aid. The group met every day and the program timeline was divided into three components. Students first studied the refugee experience through multiple lenses of ethics, political science, cultural anthropology, global health and public policy. After learning an appropriate amount of background knowledge, students were divided into two group of six. One group was sent to Damak, Nepal to study Bhutanese refugees in a traditional camp setting. The other group was sent to Cairo, Egypt in 2012 and 2013 as well as Amman, Jordan in 2014 to study Iraqi and Syrian refugees in an urban refugee camp setting. While in country, students performed life story interviews, studied the target language and assessed aid organizations that were operating to help specific refugee populations in-country. Upon returning to Duke University, the final phase of the DukeImmerse program had students convert life story interviews into monologues that were performed at Duke University's Nasher Museum of Art, highlighting specific struggles in the everyday refugee's experience. Student also wrote articles on specific areas of study such as religion, gender and identity that were later compiled into magazines published by the Kenan Institute for Ethics. The group also continually engaged the Durham Iraqi and Bhutanese refugee communities throughout the semester, creating programs like refugee women's groups and social events to build stronger safety nets for newly arrived refugees in the Durham area.

In 1992 Foy had sex reassignment surgery, and began a 20-year battle to have her birth certificate reflect her gender identity. In 2007 the Irish High Court ruled that the relevant portions of the law of the Republic of Ireland were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights, but by February 2013 the law had not been changed and she began new legal proceedings to enforce the 2007 decision. As of 15 July 2015, Ireland has passed the Gender Recognition Bill 2014. Early life and marriage Foy is a retired dentist from Athy, County Kildare. Born in a private nursing home in the Irish Midlands, Foy had five brothers and one sister. From early childhood Foy was conscious of a feeling of ‚Äòfemininity‚Äô. This continued throughout boarding school at Clongowes Wood College from 1960 to 1965. Having obtained the Leaving Certificate, Foy started pre-med studies at University College Dublin, but changed to dentistry a year later. Foy graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Dental Surgery in 1971, and began to practice as a dentist. In 1975, when living in Athlone, Foy met Anne Naughton through a music society. Naughton was a secretary from Clara, County Offaly, who was eight years younger. They got engaged, and married at the Church of Saints Peter and Paul in Horseleap on 28 September 1977. They had two children, one born in 1978, and the other in 1980. Gender confirmation In the 1980s Foy began to suffer physical and psychological problems, which worsened in August and September 1989, when she suffered a total collapse. She had psychiatric counselling, was diagnosed a transsexual and was prescribed a course of hormone treatment. Foy attended two further psychiatrists in England who diagnosed her as suffering from gender dysphoria. Foy then began a process of transitioning from male to female, with electrolysis, breast augmentation surgery, operations on the nose and Adams apple and voice surgery. On 25 July 1992, Foy underwent full, irreversible gender confirmation surgery in Brighton, England. This involved the removal of some external and internal genital tissues and surgical reconstruction of a vulva. The Irish Eastern Health Board paid ¬£3,000 towards the cost of the procedure. Subsequently, Foy lived entirely as a female. She had left the family home in 1990, and a judicial separation was granted on 13 December 1991. While Foy was at first granted conditional access to the children, who lived in custody of their mother, in May 1994 the Circuit Court prohibited all access. While Foy, who legally changed her first names in November 1993, was able to obtain passport, driving license, medical card, and polling card in the new name, her request to amend the sex on her birth certificate was refused. First court case Foy began legal proceedings in April 1997, to challenge the refusal of the Registrar General to issue her with a new birth certificate. Unemployed, Foy was represented in the action by Free Legal Advice Centres. The basis of her action was a contention that the Births and Deaths Registration (Ireland) Act 1863 did not justify the practice of using solely biological indicators existing at the time of birth to determine sex for the purposes of registration. According to Foy, she had been born a \\"congenitally disabled woman\\" and the error recording her sex on her birth certificate was not only embarrassing to her but also could interfere with her constitutional rights, as she would be unable to ever choose to marry a man. The case reached the High Court in October 2000. Foy's former wife and their daughters contested her plea, claiming that it could have \\"an adverse effect on their succession and other rights.\\" Judgment was reserved for nearly two years until 9 July 2002 when Mr Justice Liam McKechnie rejected Lydia Foy's challenge, stating that Foy had been born male based on medical and scientific evidence and that accordingly the registration could not be changed. He did express concern about the position of transsexuals in Ireland, however, and called on the government to urgently review the matter. Second court case Just two days after the decision against Foy, the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg heard a similar case (Goodwin & I v United Kingdom). Christine Goodwin, a British transsexual, had claimed that the United Kingdom's refusal to allow her to amend her birth certificate and to marry as a female violated the European Convention on Human Rights. The Court declared that the UK Government had violated Article 8 and Article 12 of the convention. In response, Britain passed the Gender Recognition Act 2004, providing for legal recognition of transgender persons in their new or acquired gender, and for the issuing of new birth certificates reflecting that gender. In 2005, the Foy case was sent back before the High Court by the Irish Supreme Court for further consideration. In the interim Ireland had passed the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 to give greater effect to the European Convention on Human Rights in Irish law. Relying on this, Foy made another application for a new birth certificate in November 2005 and when this was rejected, she issued new legal proceedings in the High Court in January 2006, referring to the Goodwin decision by the European Court of Human Rights. These proceedings were consolidated with the earlier case and the matter was heard again by Mr Justice McKechnie.\\"Foy v. An t-Ard Chlaraitheoir & Others [2007] IEHC 470\\" (http://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IEHC/2007/H470.html). 19 October 2007 On 19 October 2007, the court found Ireland in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, and decided to issue the first declaration of incompatibility between Irish and European law. According to Justice Liam McKechnie, provisions of Article 8 of the Convention protecting Foy's right to respect for private life had been violated when the State failed \\"to provide for 'meaningful recognition' of her female identity\\". He also expressed frustration at the Irish government's failure to take any steps to improve the position of transsexuals following his previous judgment in 2002.\\"Foy v. An t-Ard Chlaraitheoir & Others\\" 2002 IEHC 116\\" (http://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IEHC/2002/116.html). 9 July 2002. \\"Foy v. An t-Ard Chlaraitheoir & Others [2007] IEHC 470\\" (http://www.bailii.org/ie/cases/IEHC/2007/H470.html). Effect on law Although the issues have been raised in parliamentary debate, no ruling has been made. The declaration of incompatibility cannot override domestic law, but does place an onus on the government to reconcile Irish and European legislation. On 5 January 2009, Thomas Hammarberg, the Human Rights Commissioner of the Council of Europe, stated with respect to the transgender community and specifically Foy that \\"There is no excuse for not immediately granting this community their full and unconditional human rights.\\" Government challenge Initially challenging the 2007 ruling, on 21 June 2010 the Irish Government withdrew its appeal and set up an inter-departmental committee on the legal recognition of transsexuals. The report of this Gender Recognition Advisory Group was published in July 2011 and recommended legislation to recognise transsexuals. Launching the report, the then Minister for Social Protection Joan Burton said the government would introduce gender recognition legislation as soon as possible, but by February 2013 no legislation had been introduced. Third court case On 27 February 2013 Free Legal Advice Centres, representing Lydia Foy, announced that she had issued new proceedings in the Irish High Court seeking orders requiring the government to act on the judgment of Mr Justice McKechnie in 2007 and enable her to obtain a new birth certificate recognising her female gender.\\"Transgender woman to sue over birth certificate delay\\" (http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2013/0227/1224330566731.html).

During much of its run, it was the largest newspaper source in Richmond, competing with the morning Richmond Times-Dispatch. By the late 1960s, afternoon papers had been steadily losing their audiences to television, and The News Leader was no exception. Its circulation at one time exceeded 200,000, but at the time of its closing, it had fallen below 80,000. Notable alumni of the newspaper included historian and biographer Douglas Southall Freeman, future television journalist Roger Mudd, conservative commentator James Kilpatrick, and editorial cartoonist Jeff MacNelly.Richmond News Leader, R I P, National Review, 22 June 1992 During its run, it garnered a reputation as being one of the most politically conservative newspapers in the United States. History The News Leader began in nearby Manchester, Virginia, where it was founded as The Leader by J. F. Bradley and Ben P. Owen, Jr. in 1888. It was purchased in 1896 by Richmond newspaper publisher Joseph Bryan, who re-launched the paper on November 30 as The Evening Leader. On January 26, 1903, The Evening Leader merged with The Richmond News, which Harvey L. Wilson had founded in 1899 and John L. Williams had bought in 1900, to form The Richmond News Leader, owned by Williams. On the same day, Bryan's The Times and Williams' The Richmond Dispatch merged to become the Richmond Times-Dispatch, owned by Bryan. Bryan died in 1908, shortly after buying the News Leader from Williams, and left both papers to his son John Stewart Bryan. Both newspapers, the two primary sources of news in Richmond and the main competitors of each other, were owned and published by Stewart Bryan until 1914, when he sold the Times-Dispatch to three families, including that of Norfolk newspaperman Samuel L. Slover, publisher of The Virginian-Pilot and the Norfolk Ledger-Dispatch. In 1940, Stewart Bryan repurchased the Times-Dispatch, forming the corporation Richmond Newspapers Inc., which became a subsidiary of the newly formed Media General in 1969. Stewart Bryan died in 1944, leaving Richmond Newspapers Inc. to his son, David Tennant Bryan, who served as publisher of both papers until 1978, when his son John Stewart Bryan III took over. Tennant Bryan remained as chairman, president and CEO of Media General until his son succeeded him in 1990. Tennant Bryan died in 1998. Support for segregation During the Civil Rights Movement, the News Leader editorial page, like that of the Times- Dispatch, took a strong segregationist stance. Years after his tenure at the paper, Kilpatrick wrote that he had been an \\"ardent segregationist\\", reflecting his views in his News Leader editorials, but had since renounced segregation. In his memoirs, Mudd recalled that News Leader reporters were often told to identify local white ministers with the formal prefix \\"The Reverend\\", but local black ministers were simply to be called \\"Reverend.\\"Mudd, Roger. The Place to Be: Washington, CBS, and the Glory Days of Television News (2008). Page 7. Dr. Maurice Duke, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, claimed that the News Leader remained \\"pro-Confederacy\\" into the 1970s, while Raymond H. Boone, publisher of the black-oriented Richmond Free Press, blamed the News Leader for racial divisions in the city.After 104 Years, Richmond Newspaper Closes, The New York Times, 31 May 1992 Closure Beginning in the 1980s, the News Leader began experiencing a steady decline in circulation; the decline, like those of other afternoon newspapers at the time, was due primarily to the growth of television news outlets. By the end of the 1980s, it was obvious Richmond was no longer big enough to support separate morning and evening papers. In 1991, Media General announced that it would merge the News Leader and the Times-Dispatch into a single morning paper under the Times-Dispatch banner, effective June 1, 1992. News Leader publisher J. Stewart Bryan III, in referencing the company's dual-ownership of both newspapers, said, \\"[The News Leader is] a grand old name, but we could no longer afford the luxury of competing with ourselves.\\" The final edition of the News Leader was printed on May 30, with the single headline, \\"Nevermore.\\" On the same day, the paper also printed a special commemorative magazine showing past front pages from the News Leader reporting on historic events from the 1890s to the 1990s, including the Hindenburg disaster, the attack on Pearl Harbor, the John F. Kennedy assassination, the Challenger disaster, and the First Persian Gulf War. The magazine also featured letters to the editor by local readers, many of whom had read the News Leader for decades, who wrote about numerous personal experiences tied with the paper. Staff members were transferred to the Times-Dispatch after the merger took place. The end of the News Leader attracted national attention. Stories about the newspaper and its history appeared in The Washington Post and The New York Times. National Review, a conservative periodical, hailed the News Leader as \\"one of nation's great newspapers\\" and added, \\"[T]his distinctive journalistic voice will be missed. Its disappearance represents yet another advance of homogenization and yet another erosion of the sense of place in American journalism.

According to a tradition in Bengal, Ballala Sena's kingdom consisted of five provinces, viz., Banga, Barendra, Rar, Bagri (possibly a portion of lower Bengal), Mithila and Delhi.Ballal Sen was descended from the royal family of Bengal, who proceeded to Delhi, and was proclaimed emperor of Hindoostan.

On the other hand, these refer to his scholastic activities and social reforms. Ballala Sena is associated with the revival of orthodox Hindu practices in Bengal, in particular with the establishment of the reactionary tradition of Kulinism among Brahmins and Kayasthas. The Brahmins were classified into Kulin, ≈örotriya, Vamsaja and Saptasati; the Kayasthas were classified into Kulin and Maulik, but there is no historical authenticity. His marriage to Ramadevi, the Chalukya princess also indicates that the Sens maintained the kingdom inherited from his father, which included the present day Bangladesh, the whole of West Bengal and Mithila, i.e., portions of North Bihar. According to a cryptic passage in Adbhuta Sagara, Ballala Sena, along with his queen, retired in his old age to the confluence of the Ganges and the Yamuna leaving his son, Lakshmana Sena, with the task of both maintaining his kingdom and completing his literary work. According to a Sena epigraph, Ballala was an author. He wrote Danasagara in 1168.[https://www.jstor.org/stable/23496866?seq=21#metadata_info_tab_contents PHYLLIS GRANOFF, MY RITUALS AND MY GODS: RITUAL EXCLUSIVENESS IN MEDIEVAL INDIA, Journal of Indian Philosophy, Vol. 29, No. 1/2, Special issue: Ingalls Festschrift (April 2001), pp. 109-134] And in 1169, he started but did not finish writing Adbhutasagara. In Adbhutasagara, it was mentioned that Ballala Sena conquered Mithila while Vijaya Sena was still alive. Besides he introduced the practice of Kulinism.

He ascended the throne with the title of Al-Sultan Al-Azam Shams Al-Duniya wa Al-Din Abu Al-Muzaffar Firuz Shah Al-Sultan and invoked the name of the Abbaside Caliph Mustasim Billah in his coins. Origin Controversies persist among scholars regarding his origin and identity. According to Ibn Battuta, he was the son of Bughra Khan and the grandson of Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban. 13th century scholar, Amir Khusrow, mentioned the names of two sons of Bughra Khan - Kaiqabad and Rukunuddin Kaikaus but he did not mention the name of Shamsuddin Firuz. Moreover, Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban, following the Iranian tradition, named his grandsons as Kaikobad, Kaikaus, Kaikhusrau, Kaimurs etc. But the name Firuz does not agree with the Iranian tradition. Furthermore, Kaikobad was only 19 at the time of his accession to the throne of Delhi in 1288 AD. Kaikaus was a younger brother of Kaikobad and hence, if Firuz was a younger brother of Kaikaus, he would be in his mid-thirties at the time of his accession to the throne of Lakhnauti in 1301 AD. Two of his grown-up sons are found helping their father in affairs of state. But at such an age it is unlikely for a person to have two or more grown-up sons. On these grounds and on a close examination of his coins modern scholars hold that he did not belong to the House of Balban. Shamsuddin Firuz nowhere claims himself to be the son of a sultan, but all his sons and successors call themselves Sultan bin Sultan (Sultan, the son of Sultan). It is assumed that Shamsuddin Firuz was one of the two Firuzes left by Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban to assist his son Bughra Khan, who was appointed to the governorship of Lakhnauti. Of these two officers, Firuz Iitigin, the ruler of Bihar, was more competent. Probably Firuz Iitigin, one of the two Firuzes, after the death of Rukunuddin Kaikaus or displacing him forcibly, came to the throne of Lakhnauti in 1301 CE with the title of Sultan Shamsuddin Firuz Shah. On his accession to the throne, Sultan Shamsuddin Firuz Shah entrusted the governorship of Bihar to Tajuddin Hatim Khan, one of his sons. Expansion of kingdom Having consolidated his position, Firuz Shah turned his attention towards the expansion of his kingdom. The Muslim principality of Lakhnauti was limited to Bihar, north and northwest Bengal and up to Lakhnur in southwest Bengal. Rukunuddin Kaikaus had already started the conquest of the eastern part of Bengal, and the task was completed during the time of Firuz Shah. It is said that Kaikaus issued coins for the first time from the Kharaj of Bang. But during the time of Firuz Shah the Sonargaon area (southeast Bengal) was included in the Muslim Kingdom. He built a mint at Sonargaon from where a large number of coins were issued. Similarly, the conquest of Satgaon, begun during the time of Kaikaus under his general Zafar Khan, was completed during the time of Firuz Shah. From an inscription of Firuz, it is learnt that one Zafar Khan built a madrasa called Dar-ul-Khairat in 1313 CE. Very little is known about his conquest of Mymensingh. It is only known that his son Ghiyasuddin Bahadur issued coins from Ghiyaspur mint, identified with a village having the same name, about 24 km from Mymensingh. During the reign of Firuz Shah, his nephew Sikandar Khan Ghazi led a fruitful expedition against Matuk, a Hindu Raja of the Sundarban area. A coin of Sultan Firuz has been discovered in a village in the extreme south of Satkhira District. The most important event of the reign of Firuz Shah was the Conquest of Sylhet. According to an inscription Firuz Shah conquered Sylhet in 1303 CE. The names of the Sufi-saint Shah Jalal and the commander Syed Nasiruddin are associated in connection with the conquest of Sylhet. Firuz Shah held Bihar firmly against the Khaljis. Two inscriptions of his reign, discovered in Bihar, prove this. Thus during his time, Lakhnauti extended from at least the rivers Son and Ghogra in the west to Sylhet in the east and from Dinajpur-Rangpur in the north to Hughli and the Sundarbans in the south. Sharing power Firuz had six grown-up sons - Shihabuddin Bughda, Jalaluddin Mahmud, Ghiyasuddin Bahadur, Nasiruddin Ibrahim, Hatim Khan and Kutlu Khan. Of these six, Tajuddin Hatim Khan was the governor of Bihar. It is evident from numismatic evidence that during the lifetime of Firuz Shah, his sons Jalaluddin Mahmud, Shihabuddin Bughda and Ghiyasuddin Bahadur issued coins in their own names from the Lakhnauti mint. Ghiyasuddin Bahadur also issued coins from the mints of Sonargaon and Ghiyaspur. A group of scholars, on the basis of these coins, have argued that the sons of Firuz Shah rose in rebellion against their father and alternately ruled Lakhnauti. But the minting of coins by the sons of Firuz Shah was not the result of their rebellion, rather it was the result of their sharing of power with their father. In fact, Firuz Shah ascended the throne of Lakhnauti at quite an advanced age when he was the father of six grown-up sons who helped him in the affairs of the kingdom. Being satisfied with the co-operation of his sons, Firuz Shah allowed his sons to run the administration of some portions of his kingdom independently and to exercise royal authority as in the minting of coins. Had the sons revolted against their father, chaos and confusion would have prevailed and expansion of the kingdom would not have been possible. Death Firuz Shah died in 1322 CE.

HistoryGovernor of Bengal= Bughra Khan assisted his father, Sultan Ghiyasuddin Balban, to crush the rebellion of the governor of Lakhnauti, Tughral Tughan Khan. Then Bughra was appointed the governor of Bengal. After the death of his eldest brother, Prince Muhammad, he was asked to take the throne of Delhi by Sultan Ghiyasuddin.

Nijamuddin, the Prime Minister, appointed Nasiruddin Bughra Khan's son, Qaiqabad, as the Sultan of Delhi. But inefficient ruling of Qaiqabad spread anarchy in Delhi. Qaiqabad became a mere puppet in the hand of wazir Nijamuddin. Bughra Khan decided to bring an end to the anarchy in Delhi and advanced with a huge army towards Delhi. At the same time, Nijamuddin forced Qaiqabad to advance with a massive army to confront his father. The two armies met in the banks of Saryu river. But the father and the son reached an understanding instead of facing a bloody battle. Qaiqabad acknowledged Bughra Khan's independence from Delhi and also removed Najimuddin as his wazir. Bughra Khan returned to Lakhnauti. =Renouncing power= The death of Qaiqabad in 1289 shocked Bughra Khan.

Although written some years after the other two novels, the setting once again features a mix of fantasy and steampunk elements but unlike the others, the protagonist in The Stone Giant is the roguish Theophile Escargot. Few of the characters from the previous novels appear but the antagonist is once again the evil sorcerer Selznak (although referred to as \\"Uncle Abner\\" in the story). The book was first published as an Ace paperback by Berkley Books. The story, a parody of the heroic quest, is set in a world where human beings live alongside elves, goblins, witches, wizards, and other fantastic beings. There Theophile Escargot, a Rip Van Winkle-like malcontent, has series of comic misadventures while attempting both to impress a pretty barmaid and to revenge himself on an evil dwarf who cheated him out of a bag of marbles. Plot summary In a fit of pique Escargot eats a pie that his wife had been withholding to bribe him into attending a revival meeting. Unfortunately Stover, the revivalist, is also the local judge and has designs on Escargot's wealthy wife; Escargot winds up homeless and indigent. He becomes infatuated with Leta, Stover's barmaid, and is introduced to a dwarf he believes to be her uncle. Escargot had purchased a bag of odd marbles from a (a kind of gypsy/hobo); the dwarf first swindles them from the hapless divorc√©, then humiliates and terrifies him for laughs. After obtaining a settlement from his ex-wife, Escargot leaves for the coastal town of Seaside where he hopes to find Leta at the annual Harvest Festival. A series of misadventures leads him to the submarine of a piratical elf; winding up in sole possession of the vessel Escargot travels through an undersea passage into the land of Balumnia, a sort of siamese-twin world. Escargot's fortunes do not seem to improve as he is rapidly cheated out of money and goods, but he has a surprise encounter with the dwarf and resolves to pursue him. The dwarf attempts to eliminate Escargot but through a combination of persistence and improvisation Escargot survives and learns the dwarf's evil plan: sacrifice Leta and use the marbles to revive the stone giants, ancient enemies of the elves. With the assistance of an eccentric crew of sky-faring elves, Escargot seeks an opportunity to rescue Leta and redeem his many foibles.James Blaylock, The Stone Giant, Ballantine, 1989.

It was presented by veteran broadcaster Chris Evans, who moved to Drivetime from his Saturday afternoon show after Johnnie Walker left the slot after seven years in 2006. On 7 September 2009 the BBC announced that Evans would take over the breakfast show from the retiring Terry Wogan, from January 2010, and on 15 September it was confirmed that Simon Mayo would replace Evans on Drivetime. Mayo had been a stand in presenter for Evans on a few occasions.  Ethos  Chris thanked Steve Wright or his stand in for their show, and then declared \\"now it's our go, and that includes you\\". Throughout the show, Chris played a mixture of music both old and new, spoke to people that were making the more bizarre headlines, and read listeners' texts and emails. Unlike most live radio programmes, each show was given a title, usually of a quirky nature, and was dedicated to a person or group. Usually this group was all people who had done something that particular day, such as \\"resisted a craving\\".  The team  Chris was joined throughout the programme by three colleagues. Rebecca Pike, n√©e Fox, brought listeners the business news. Jonny Saunders read the sports headlines. Sally Boazman presented the travel updates. = Rebecca Pike = Rebecca Pike, formerly Fox, and known commonly as Foxy, read the business headlines including the FTSE market data and exchange rates, at 17:20 and 18:20 each day. Listeners also sent in their business-related questions, which Foxy then answered in the second slot. This feature was known as Fox the Fox and was accompanied by Danny Kaye's Outfox the Fox, which acted as the theme tune. Fox the Fox did not appear on Fridays, when the 18:20 round-up was marked with an innovation slot. = Jonny Saunders = Jonny Saunders rounded up the sports headlines at several points during the show, and spoke to a sports personality every day at 18:50, who was said to be \\"in the locker\\". Chris tended to introduce the locker slot by asking Jonny: \\"Who's in the locker-cocker?\\" Jonny's Friday slot included a talk about a \\"mad sport\\". Jonny also provided the voice for top tenuous, jukebox jury and gobsmackers. See below. = Sally Boazman = As well as her traffic duties, Sally was involved with various other aspects of the show's line-up. See below.  Features, Monday ‚Äì Thursday  As well as business, sport and traffic; the line-up on most weekdays included various features. = The Kids = Chris and Sally spoke to a child each day, who had done something for the first time ever. Their achievements were awarded with a fanfare. = Woman's Minute = In a gentle parody of BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour, Chris spoke to four women in quick succession. They were asked who they were, where they were and what they were driving, and for their answer to that week's question. In early 2009, Chris asked the question: \\"What do you do that's a bit nutty but effective?\\" and it was deemed so effective that it remained active until April. = Theme Time Radio Minute = A parody of Bob Dylan's Theme Time Radio Hour, Chris played a listener- requested TV theme tune. = Top Tenuous = Jonny decided the famous person whose listener associations were showcased. This was usually somebody who had been in the news on that day. The aim was for these associations to be as weak as possible, with the top 10 most tenuous being the ones selected. = Drivetime Jukebox Jury = Jonny also presided over the Jukebox Jury. A new track was played, and listeners were invited to text either \\"hit\\" or \\"miss\\", plus their comments, to the programme. Jonny read The Good, The Bad and The Ugly of these comments (over said theme tune) before Chris announced whether the track was overall a hit or a miss. Sir Tom Jones was present at the judgement of his single \\"Give a Little Love\\", but Chris claimed that there were no negative texts received. = Gobsmackers = Immediately following the drivetime jukebox jury, two connected tracks were played, which were selected by a listener. = Monday Mince = In 2009, a cheesy song was played after the 18:00 news each Monday, dedicated to burly truckers everywhere. = Thirsty Thursday = Thursday's programme was known as Thirsty Thursday, and included food with Nigel Barden. The daily clips of how to contact the show were also played simultaneously, as something of a special treat.  All Request Friday  On Fridays, each song was selected by a listener, and all features apart from sport, business and travel were suspended. The first track was selected on the blog, and thereafter listeners phoned in their requests. All-request Friday was introduced by a hearty rendition of the song \\"Bring Chris Evans On\\". When the Friday show was cancelled, such as in Holy Week, Thursday was used as the request day. = The H Spot and The C Spot = Selected annually, the only songs not requested by listeners were played at 17:20 and 18:20. In 2009, the 17:20 tune was the theme to Happy Days, known as the H Spot. The 18:20 spot, which marked the beginning of the weekend, was Sammy Davis, Jr.'s \\"The Candy Man\\", having previously been occupied by the E Spot; Elvis Presley's \\"The Wonder of You\\"; and, in 2008, the \\"D Spot\\"; Tom Jones' \\"Delilah\\", marked the beginning of the weekend. The E Spot was chosen because a listener on the blog chose \\"The Wonder of You\\" as the first song of the show, on the week Lesley Douglas resigned. Chris announced that if he ever decided to end the D Spot he would replace it with the E Spot. Chris and Sally sang along, and listeners were encouraged to inform the show of where they sang along.  Mascot  Also selected annually was the drivetime mascot. The Rex Factor saw listeners' dogs battle it out to become the official mascot. The mascot until the end of the show's run was Biscuit, a bearded collie/terrier X.

The National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library (NCSML) is a museum and library of Czech and Slovak history and culture located in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in the United States. Established in 1974, the museum and library moved to its present site in 1983. The museum and library was severely affected by the Iowa flood of 2008. In 2012, rebuilding and expansion efforts were completed and the NCSML reopened. History until the 2008 flood In 1974, several second and third-generation Czech Americans in the Cedar Rapids area founded the Czech Fine Arts Foundation to preserve their Czech heritage and culture. In 1978, the group's growing collection of artifacts and documents caused them to open a Czech Museum in a three-room house, where the museum attracted additional materials and volunteers. In 1981, the collections were moved to a new building on the museum's current site with the goal of permanent public display. In 1983, the group acquired a 19th-century immigrant home and moved it to its property, where it was restored and furnished in the style of the 1880s and 1890s. From 1983 onwards, the museum began to employ staff, and during the 1980s gained additional artifacts and financial contributions from Czech and Slovak Americans. The museum adopted its current name during this period. By the 1990s, the museum and library were outgrowing its space, and plans for a new facility began, with an architect creating plans for a new building. Fundraising for the new facility began during this time. On October 28, 1993, groundbreaking took place for the new building. On October 21, 1995, the building was dedicated, with U.S. President Bill Clinton, Czech President V√°clav Havel, and Slovakian President Michal Kov√°ƒç presiding over the ceremony.National Czech and Slovak Museum and Library.

Spectator.sme.sk. Retrieved on 2013-09-05. On May 24, 1997, the NCSML opened an international exhibit, \\"A Thousand Years of Czech Culture: Riches from the National Museum in Prague,\\" which centered on artifacts on loan from the National Museum in Prague. The museum stated that the exhibit attracted more than 30,000 visitors from around the U.S. and 22 countries. In 1998, a permanent exhibit, \\"Homelands: The Story of the Czech and Slovak People,\\" opened. In 1999, the museum hosted its history and culture conference for the first time. In 2000, the museum underwent significant renovations and remodeling, including the addition of secure and climate-controlled storage facilities and a new venue for temporary exhibits, created by dividing the social/rental hall. In the same year, the library's collection doubled with the acquisition of the Slavic language collection from Benedictine University, and the museum and library began publishing Slovo, a history and culture academic journal. In subsequent years, the museum continued to grow its collections, membership, and events schedule. In 2001, the museum began planning to acquire additional property for a research and performing arts center, and began a fundraising campaign to build its endowment to $5 million by 2005. The NCSML stated that its membership in 2002 was above 1,900 people. In 2002, the museum and library opened \\"Kroje‚ÄîDress for the Dance of Life!,\\" an exhibit on Kroje which ran until January 19, 2003. The museum also hosted the annual meetings of the Czech Glass Collectors Guild and the Czech-Slovak Genealogical Society International during this time..

The damage was variously valued at $8 million or $9 million. The flood occurred just days before the museum was scheduled to reveal its choice among four proposals for a tripling in the size of the facility.US National Czech and Slovak Museum wrecked - The Slovak Spectator. Spectator.sme.sk. Retrieved on 2013-09-05. Museum staff were able to remove two trucks full of museum and library material before the flood. Fine art and folklore artifacts were prioritized for removal. Two exhibits were destroyed in the flood, including one about the Prague Spring in 1968 and the subsequent invasion of Czechoslovakia. In the immediate aftermath of the flood, artifacts were removed from the building's upper levels, which were not reached by floodwaters, and flood-damaged items were removed for restoration efforts, with some library books sent to Chicago to be freeze-dried and restored. The Chicago Conservation Center assisted by providing expert help in efforts to save textiles and linens. At the time of the 2008 flood the museum was visited by about 35,000 people each year, with an annual economic impact of $1 million. The library held an estimated 30,000 Slovak and Slovak-related items in its library, two-thirds of which are stored off-site and were not affected by flood damage. Around 40 percent of the museum's artifacts are Slovak. The museum holds the largest collection of kroje outside Slovakia and the Czech Republic, with the oldest pieces dating to the 16th century. During the flood the NCSML's entire collection of 5,000 phonograph records, documenting 80 years of recorded Czech and Slovak music, were damaged. The University of Iowa Libraries Preservation Department were able to repair and restore most of the records. After the flood, a temporary facility was opened at Lindale Mall. The museum's temporary home was moved in April 2010 to the Kosek Building at 87 Sixteenth Avenue SW in Cedar Rapids, built in 1910. The interim space, including a gallery and museum gift shop, was opened. An exhibition, \\"Rising Above: The Story of the People and the Flood\\" also opened at that time. The exhibit focuses on the 2008 flood, comparing it to the previous floods of 1929 and 1993, and includes materials from the NCSML's Flood Oral History Project, an oral history project of the personal accounts of flood victims. The exhibit tells the story of the flood in conjunction with the history of Cedar Rapids, the Czech Village, and New Bohemia. The Kosek Building continues to be a part of the Museum and Library after the main building was rebuilt. The Iowa General Assembly set aside $10 million to help the museum and library rebuild. In October 2008 the Czech ambassador presented a $405,000 donation from the Czech Republic for reconstruction efforts. The flood damage caused the museum property to have difficulty obtaining insurance and exhibitions with materials on loan from other museums because of a fear of another flood. The museum decided to move and expand the museum to higher ground, rather than demolishing the original building, because the cost to move the 15-year-old building was $713,000, compared to an estimated $2 million to demolish and rebuild the structure. Despite the flood damage, the building remained structurally sound. The museum also stated that it wanted to preserve the original building for its historic value and avoid creating unnecessary landfill waste. The New National Czech & Slovak Museum & LibraryThe museum was moved from the original site and was placed on an elevated foundation. A groundbreaking ceremony was held on December 15, 2010. On June 8‚Äì9, 2011, the Museum and Library, weighing around 1,500 tons (1,400 metric tons) and constructed of a wood frame with brick veneer, was moved to the new site. The building new site is higher than the previous site and above the 2008 flood level. The museum dubbed the event \\"A Monumental Move\\" and set up a webcam for viewers to watch the move; the City of Cedar Rapids also shut down 16th Avenue SW, including the Bridge of Lions, so local residents could watch. The museum's contractor for the job, Jeremy Patterson Structural Moving, stated that \\"it's apparently the largest museum ever relocated for flood hazard mitigation, and probably the only museum ever elevated.\\"National Czech & Slovak Museum & Library. Ncsml.org. Retrieved on 2013-09-05. In addition to moving the first building to a new location, the rebuilt facility is significantly expanded, to a total of including \\"larger permanent and temporary exhibition galleries, an expanded research library, educational programming space, a new museum store, collection storage, and work space.\\" The new facility will be LEED-certified and will include a new library and archives, 51-seat theater, three galleries, public and educational programming space for up to 400 people, underground parking for 65 vehicles, a terrace with a view of the Cedar River and Cedar Rapids skyline, and an outdoor amphitheater. The rebuilding and recovery costs are estimated to be $25 million. The NCSML was accredited by the American Alliance of Museums in November 2008. In 2010, the museum launched a capital campaign with a goal of raising $25 million to establish the Kosek Building as part of the NCSML's permanent collection, renovate The Immigrant Home and the Babi Buresh Center historic homes for tour, design and install a new permanent exhibition, recovery money spent by the museum and library on disaster cleanup; and grow the endowment to pay for operating expenses. The NCSML stated that following the museum's reopening, an estimated 54,000 visitors will visit annually and the economic impact on the Cedar Rapids area will be over $1.1 million.

A Big Bud 440 with an air drill follows on the next pass. The Big Bud 747 or 16V-747 Big Bud is a large, custom-made farm tractor built in Havre, Montana in 1977. It has 1100 horsepower. It is billed by the owners and exhibitors as the \\"World's Largest Farm Tractor\\". It is about twice the size of many of the largest production tractors in the world, depending on parameter. History The first two Big Bud tractors out of the Havre, Montana plant were the 250-series and were purchased by Leonard M. Semenza of Semenza Farms in 1968 located between Fort Benton, Montana, and Chester, Montana on his 35,000 acre farm. The 747 tractor was originally and built by Ron Harmon and the employees of his Northern Manufacturing Company, at a cost of $300,000. It was made for the Rossi Brothers, cotton farmers of Bakersfield or Old River, California,. It was used there for 11 years, then it was purchased by Willowbrook Farms of Indialantic, Florida. Both farms used it for deep ripping. After a period of disuse, it was purchased by Robert and Randy Williams, of Big Sandy, Montana, within of where it was built, in 1997. It was used on the Williams Brothers' farm in Chouteau County to pull an cultivator, covering per minute at a speed up to . The United Tire Company of Canada, which made the tractor's custom tires, went bankrupt in 2000, partially contributing to the decision to stop using the tractor for regular work in July 2009, and to move the Big Bud 747 to museums. After its work on the farm, it was displayed at the Heartland Acres Agribition Center in Independence, Iowa. In 2014, the Big Bud 747 was moved to the Heartland Museum in Clarion, Iowa, on indefinite loan from the Williams Brothers; the museum constructed a separate shed for the tractor in 2013. On July 14, 2020, the Big Bud's original 8 foot tall construction tires were replaced with Goodyear LSW1400/30r46 tires (which are slightly under 7 feet tall),https://www.titan- intl.com/tires/OPTITRAC?product=G0PDS6https://www.facebook.com/combinesharvestersthreshers/videos/1037003870097074/?__so__=permalink&__rv__=related_videos with new rims provided by the Williams Brothers to fit them. The new tires brought the width of the Big Bud to just over 25 feet. The Big Bud 747 returned to the Williams Brothers farm near Big Sandy, Montana in September of 2020, where it worked farm ground once again with an 80 foot wide FRIGGSTAD chisel plow.

It featured a four-cylinder, SOHC, air-cooled, wet sump engine, with two valves per cylinder. The CB650 was a development of the CB550, itself derived from the even earlier CB500. The CB650 was the last of Honda's successful series of air-cooled SOHC fours that began in 1969 with the Honda CB750.  Model development  For cost-saving purposes, the CB650 was designed to be produced on the same production line as its CB550 predecessor, using the existing tooling. The CB650's cylinder block was a new design, but it shared the stud holes of the earlier bike, which may explain why the bike could not be a full 650cc machine. Likewise, the frame was almost identical to that of the CB550. Handlebar levers and instruments (speedometer and tachometer) were also carried over from the earlier model. The CB650 produced a claimed @ 9,000 rpm.[Cycle Guide Vol.13, No.12 December 1979]. In 1980, the CB650 was re- styled but there were no significant mechanical changes. After 1981, the CB650 had a modified cylinder head and new CV vacuum carburettors, and the bike was now available in either Standard or custom configurations. The latter had \\"cruiser\\" styling with a teardrop tank, chromed air-box, and smaller side covers. The 1980‚Äì1982 Standard model featured 4-into-2 exhaust pipes, a black plastic headlight nacelle, and wire-spoked wheels. The custom model featured 4-into-4 exhaust, Comstar wheels, a chrome headlight nacelle, and in 1981, dual disc front brakes and air-assisted forks. A second generation model was produced from 1982 to 1985. In 1982, replacing the Custom, the new Nighthawk featured a re-designed tank and side covers, while the 1982 Standard model remained largely unchanged. In 1983, the SOHC engine was replaced by a new rubber-mounted DOHC engine featuring hydraulic valve-lash adjusters; and final drive was changed from chain to shaft-drive.

S√§chs. Sts. E. B.). Between 1860 and 1867 Hartmann had supplied 24 locomotives to the Western State Railway and in 1865 Borsig delivered a further nine; all of which were transferred to the Royal Saxon State Railways in 1869. In 1870 another eight locomotives by Hartmann went straight to the state railway. As 2-4-0 \\"fast-stopping train\\" (Eilzug) locomotives they were classified as B VI and H VI according to their manufacturer. In 1874 Schwartzkopff had delivered 14 2-4-0 express engines to the Berlin-Dresden Railway. After the company had been nationalised in 1887 by Prussia, the line and its running and rolling stock were divided in 1888 between Prussia and Saxony. Six of these express locomotives were given to the K. S√§chs. Sts. E. B. as Class Schw VI, the other eight went into the Prussian state railways. The Leipzig‚ÄìDresden Railway Company had also procured 6 express train locomotives in 1875 and another 6 in 1876 from Henschel, which after nationalisation in 1876 were classified as Hsch VI or even Hl VI. The first examples still had a boiler with a rectangular dome by Stephenson and a forked frame. Later models (Schwartzkopff, Henschel) were built with a Crampton boiler and full plate frame. Because some of their technical details differed markedly from those of the Borsig and Hartmann batches (smaller driving wheels, higher boiler pressure) they are given at several places in the table in brackets. All examples had horizontal, outside cylinders. Two engines from the 1870 Hartmann batch were given a Nowotny carrying axle in 1885, changing the axle arrangement from 1B to 1'B and the classification to H VIb. The older Class VI models (in 1896 manufacturer's code letter(s) were dropped from the classification) were taken out of service about the start of the 20th century (by 1905); those from Schwartzkopff- and Henschel followed from 1910 onwards. Even though these machines had already become rarities in the 1920s, three examples were still included in the preliminary Deutsche Reichsbahn renumbering plan as 34 8001‚Äì8003; but the class was no longer represented by the time the final numbering scheme came out in 1925.

It is organized by the Federal Association of Motorcycle Riders in Germany. Since 1989 it has taken place in the Bavarian forest, near the Czech border, where snow is guaranteed. Each year between 5,000 and 10,000 riders from all over Europe participate, some bringing modified motorcycles and special designs. History Z√ºndapp KS601 The meeting was created in 1956 by Ernst Leverkus, who had organized it as meeting for winter-resilient drivers of the well-known Z√ºndapp KS 601 motorcycle- sidecar combination. The KS 601 (the \\"Green elephant\\") gave its name to the meeting. Initially from 1956 the meeting took place at the Solitude Racetrack near Stuttgart. After changing places the organizer, BVDM, took over 1961 and placed the meeting at the N√ºrburgring. After serious problems and organizational changes in 1978 a transfer took place to the Salzburgring -- in the first year still as an emergency meeting with 400 participants, but, starting in 1979, it became a regular meeting. Attendance is now around 5,000. In 1988 the rally was canceled, as BVDM no longer wished to bear the liability and risk for it. At the Salzburgring only a privately organized emergency meeting took place. Since 1989 the meeting has taken place in the same area as the Stock Car club. The most important change is the complete prohibition of all vehicles except motorcycles for several kilometers around the periphery of the meeting area. New regulations called Zur√ºck f√ºr die Zukunft, or \\"Backwards for the Future\\" in English, were established for the 2015 rally to enforce a return to the event's spartan roots. The rules are meant to ensure that participants do not stage elaborate tents with furnaces or trailer their vehicles to the event. They are now required not to stop to unload trailers or lorries in surrounding towns and roads, to only bring street-legal motorcycles or sidecars on the campsite, and to carry all their camping gear on motorcycles. Old Elephant Rally After the rally was canceled in 1988, some private individuals organized a parallel alternative meeting, which has taken place since then each year. Since 1990 it is held at the N√ºrburgring under the name Altes Elefantentreffen (Old Elephant Rally). It takes place as a rule two weeks after the Elephant Rally.

What changes from shop to shop is the number of stages, the number and size of teams, and the structure of the team interdependencies. Recommended practices Multi-stage continuous integration is an expansion upon continuous integration, it presumes that you are already following those recommended practices. The larger and/or more complex the project, the higher the chance that the project becomes unstable. Alerts and broken builds increase as the project grows. Progress decreases and the mainline gets increasingly unstable. The risk of build failure increases exponentially as the number and locations of developers grow.http://damonpoole.blogspot.com/2008/01/advanced-multi- stage-continous.html Advanced Multi-Stage Integration, accessdate 2009-03-19, Poole, Damon, 2009-01-17 Agile Development Thoughts =Recommended practice #1= Each developer works on their own task. As they make changes, continuous integration is done against that team's branch. If it does not succeed, then that developer (possibly with help from her teammates) fixes the branch. When there is a problem, only that team is affected, not the whole development effort. This is similar to how stopping the line works in a modern lean manufacturing facility. If someone on the line pulls the \\"stop the line\\" cord, it only affects a segment of the line, not the whole line. It is note-worthy that in recent years the \\"topic\\" or \\"feature\\" branch model has gained in popularity over the team based branch model. See for example the popular Git- Flow branching model http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ On a frequent basis, the team will decide to go to the second phase: integration with the mainline. In this phase, the team does the same thing that an individual would do in the case of mainline development. The team's branch must have all changes from the mainline merged in (the equivalent of a workspace update), there must be a successful build and all tests must pass. Integrating with the mainline will be easier than usual because only pre- integrated features will be in it, not features in-process. Then, the team's changes are merged into the mainline which will trigger a build and test cycle on the mainline. If that passes, then the team goes back to the first phase where individual developers work on their own tasks. Otherwise, the team works on getting the mainline working again, just as though they were an individual working on mainline. Changes propagate as rapidly as possible, stopping only when there is a problem. Ideally, changes make it to the main integration area just as frequently as when doing mainline development. The difference is that fewer problems make it all the way to the main integration area. Multi-stage continuous integration allows for a high degree of integration to occur in parallel while vastly reducing the scope of integration problems.http://www.cmcrossroads.com/content/view/12685/135/ Large Scale Continuous Integration, Poole, Damon, 2009-01-19 CMCrossroads Published by CMC Media =Recommended practice #2= For multi-stage continuous integration, each team must have its own branch. Advantages Multi-stage continuous integration has many advantages: * When unit tests fail, or a bug is discovered, developers might revert the codebase back to a bug-free state, without wasting time debugging; * Integration problems are detected and fixed continuously - no last minute hiatus before release dates; * Early warning of broken/incompatible code; * Early warning of conflicting changes; * Immediate unit testing of all changes; * Constant availability of a \\"current\\" build for testing, demo, or release purposes; * The immediate impact of checking in incomplete or broken code acts as an incentive to developers to learn to work more incrementally with shorter feedback cycles.

Early and family life Battle was born in Charlottesville, Virginia. He was the son of John S. Battle, former Governor of Virginia (1950‚Äì54). While attending the University of Virginia, Battle played on the varsity golf team, until his graduation in 1941. Battle served in the U.S. Navy during World War II and was awarded the Silver Star. He was in the same squadron in the South Pacific as John F. Kennedy and participated in Kennedy's rescue from the island on which he and his crew were marooned. After the war, he returned to the University of Virginia, earned a law degree in 1947, and was admitted to the Virginia bar. Career Battle worked in his father's law firm, as well as helped his father win election as Governor of Virginia in 1950. During the Massive Resistance crisis, both Battles represented the Albemarle County Public Schools, who were being sued by the NAACP on behalf of parents who wanted their children to attend integrated schools. After joint decisions of the Virginia Supreme Court and three-judge federal panel on January 19, 1959, undercut the Massive Resistance laws, known as the Stanley Plan (which, among other provisions, proposed closing any public school acceding to a court desegregation order), Battle ultimately negotiated a settlement with the NAACP, and Charlottesville public schools reopened. The younger Battle later worked on Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign and was appointed Ambassador to Australia, serving from 1962 to 1964. In 1969, in an election that became known for the crumbling of the Massive Resistance and the Byrd Organization, Battle, the Democrats' gubernatorial candidate, lost to Linwood Holton. Holton who put his children in Richmond's mostly African-American public schools, became the first Republican governor of the Commonwealth since the end of the Reconstruction Era. While Senator Harry F. Byrd had died several years previously, Virginia's other long-term Senator A. Willis Robertson also lost in this election, and when Senator Harry F. Byrd Jr. ran for re-election the following year, he did so as an \\"independent\\". Battle later became president and CEO of Fieldcrest Mills, a textile manufacturer, where he served as president from 1971 to 1981. In 1978, Battle was elected to the executive committee of the United States Golf Association where he served until 1989. He served as USGA President from 1988 to 1989. He was also president of the Mid- Atlantic Golf Association in 1953. Family Battle died in Charlottesville, Virginia after suffering a stroke. He was survived by his wife Barry (n√©e Webb) Battle, three children, Cullen Battle, Robert Battle and Janie Battle Richards, and six grandchildren.

The battle The memorial commemorates an encounter that took place during the Arras offensive in which the British First and Third Armies attacked eastward from Arras on a 22-kilometre front. The 88th Brigade, the brigade in which the Royal Newfoundland Regiment was serving, was to execute a two-battalion attack against an objective known as Infantry Hill. The Royal Newfoundland Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant- Colonel James Forbes-Robertson, was on the right and the 1st Essex Battalion on the left. At 5:30 a.m. on 14 April, the barrage opened and the two battalions began their advance. As the Royal Newfoundland Regiment advanced towards the high ground of Infantry Hill they were subjected to a strong German counterattack which surrounded both the Royal Newfoundland Regiment and the 1st Essex Battalion. By 9:00am the surviving groups of men were forced to surrender. Although all communication by telephone had been cut by artillery fire, a wounded man from the 1st Essex Battalion managed to make it to battalion headquarters to report that all men in the 1st Essex Battalion and Royal Newfoundland Regiment had either been killed or captured. The Germans pressed their counterattack, and soon advanced to the edge of Monchy-le-Preux capturing the trenches from which the 1st Essex Battalion and Royal Newfoundland Regiment had launched their attack. Lieutenant-Colonel James Forbes-Robertson quickly collected all available men of his headquarters staff, as well as weapons and ammunition from dead and wounded soldiers, and led twenty men through the shattered streets of Monchy-le-Preux under heavy artillery fire to a small berm on the outskirts of village. Establishing themselves in this shallow ditch the nine remaining men opened fire on the approaching Germans and kept the Germans ignorant of their pitifully weak numbers. A tenth man who was knocked unconscious joined the other 9 an hour and a half later. These ten men held their position for 11 hours until they were finally relieved after dark. After 4 hours they were able to send one of the men several kilometres to the rear to apprise the British of the situation which allowed them to get artillery support. A Platoon of Hampshires were sent up and provided infantry support amongst the ruins of Monchy. The British bombardment not only helped keep the Germans at bay but also led to a lot of the Newfoundland Regiment soldiers still lying wounded out in the field to be killed. Total casualties for the Royal Newfoundland Regiment numbered 460. 166 were killed or died of wounds, 141 were wounded and 153 became prisoners. The 1st Essex Battalion fared no better and suffered 602 casualties of which 400 were taken prisoner. The heroic action of these ten men, who never thought they would survive 15 minutes, let alone 11 hours stopped the British planners from major embarrassment. The planning of this action was so inept that had they been successful they would have occupied an extreme salient covering a lot of ground. Far too much territory for the number of men sent out. As well the planners forgot to occupy the village in case of a counter attack. The village had been a hard won victory of the 37th Division only 3 days before. If those 10 men failed the Germans would have literally walked into Monchy and taken over. And considering Monchy's importance to the overall success of the Battle of Arras, this makes the mistake all the more incredible. Memorial The Monchy-le-Preux Memorial is one of five erected in Europe by the Newfoundland government following the First World War. It is one of four in France, with the others at Beaumont-Hamel, Gueudecourt and Masni√®res. The fifth stands at Courtrai/Kortrijk in Belgium. A sixth Caribou was a gift from Major Howe-Green, OBE, who served with the Newfoundlanders during the war and stands at Bowring Park in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada. The memorials are all bronze caribou, the emblem of the Royal Newfoundland Regiment designed by British sculptor Basil Gotto. While the other four Newfoundland battlefield memorials in Europe stand atop cairns of Newfoundland granite and are surrounded by native Newfoundland plants, the Monchy-le-Preux Memorial differs in that it is perched upon the ruins of what was a German bunker. It faces in the direction from which the Battalion withstood the German attack, a point known at the time as Infantry Hill. It is found in the centre of the village, on the north side of Rue de la Chaussy about 30 metres/yards from the D33.

It was invented by William Bridges Adams and patented in 1865. The invention uses axle boxes that slide on an arc in shaped horn blocks, so allowing the axle to slide out to either side. This is similar to the movement of a Bissell truck, but with the notional centre point of the curve being where the pivot of the truck would be. This design, using slide bearings, is more expensive than one employing a shaft, but takes up less space. Trials In 1865 the Society of Engineers, London, made direct comparison between the radial axle, invented by William Bridges Adams, and a bogie design with an india-rubber central bearing invented by William Adams: during trials on the North London Railway the laterally sprung bogie was thought superior to the radial axle, but when William Adams moved from the NLR to the London and South Western Railway he adopted the design of his rival William Bridges Adams; the locomotives now known as Adams Radials are named after the LSWR Locomotive Superintendent, but are famous for the axle invented by William Bridges Adams. Notwithstanding the 1865 comparative trials of the two inventors' products, there is some confusion over the inventor of the axle. Lexicon der Eisenbahn cites William Adams (1823-1904) as the inventor.

Gordon, Yosef Aharonovich, Yosef Sprinzak and followed a non-Marxist, Zionist, socialist agenda. Hapoel Hatzair was a pacifist, anti-militarist group that sought to establish a Jewish foothold in Palestine through manual labor and agricultural settlement. History Hapoel Hatzair was formed in 1905 by ten members of the second wave of Jewish immigrants to Palestine, who came between 1904 and 1914.Charles D. Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, Bedford/St. Martin's, Boston, 2007. , p. 38.Rafael Medoff, Chaim I. Waxman, Historical Dictionary of Zionism, Routledge, 5 Sep 2013 The new immigrants sought to build a Jewish socialist homeland in Palestine and formed two groups in order to accomplish this: Poale Zion (Workers of Zion) and Hapoel Hatzair.Charles D. Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, Bedford/St. Martin's, Boston, 2007. , p. 40. By 1906, Hapoel Hatzair had grown to 90 members.Walter Laqueur, The History of Zionism, Knopf Publishing Group, 2003, , p.282.Rafael Medoff, Chaim I. Waxman, Historical Dictionary of Zionism, Routledge, 5 Sep 2013 In 1907, it founded a newspaper of the same name.Rafael Medoff, Chaim I. Waxman, Historical Dictionary of Zionism, Routledge, 5 Sep 2013 By 1910, the group had grown, although not to huge numbers. There were only 500 members of Hapoel Hatzair and Poale Zion combined. Hapoel Hatzair's commitment to practical Zionism and the conquest of labour created a group that was dedicated to the creation of new Jewish agricultural communities. Hapoel Hatzair settled land bought from Arab effendis (landowners) by the Jewish National Fund in accordance with socialist principles.6\\\\. Charles D. Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, Bedford/St. Martin's, Boston, 2007. , p.40. Competition with Ahdut Ha'Avoda When Ahdut HaAvoda was formed in 1919, Hapoel Hatzair decided not to join, although some members did leave to join Ahdut HaAvoda.Charles D. Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, Bedford/St. Martin's, Boston, 2007. , p.121. Leaders of Hapoel Hatzair felt that the Labor Union, which had strong political ambitions, would dominate any united group and they did not want this to cause them to compromise Hapoel Hatzair's role as the conscience of the labor movement.Walter Laqueur, The History of Zionism, Knopf Publishing Group, 2003, , p.304-305. By not joining Ahdut HaAvoda, Hapoel Hatzair was forced to enter into the urban worker movement. While powerful among agricultural workers, Hapoel Hatzair did not have a large following in the towns; however, they did have a significant following among writers, teachers, and other intellectuals, which although not helpful in the political arena, did bring more prestige to the group.Walter Laqueur, The History of Zionism, Knopf Publishing Group, 2003, , p.305. Over time, members of Hapoel Hatzair and Ahdut HaAvoda realized that they were duplicating work. As both groups existed as a labor group as well as a political party, they had separate employment exchanges, mutual aid organisations, cultural and social clubs, and sickness funds. In 1920, it was suggested that unite. This led to the formation of the Histadrut, which was a single workers organization to control labor. While these parties had united their labor organizations into the Histadrut, they continued to fight for dominance of this group. In the first election in 1924, Hapoel Hatzair won 27 seats, which was second only to Ahdut HaAvoda, which held 38.Amos Perlmutter, \\"Berl Katznelson and the Theory and Practice of Revolutionary Constructivism\\" in Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 13, No. 1 (Jan., 1977). pp. 71-89. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4282621 , accessed Feb 26, 2009. While Ahdut HaAvoda was larger, Hapoel Hatzair was more powerful; In 1921 Yosef Sprinzak of Hapoel Hatzair was the first member of the labor movement to be elected to the Zionist Executive. Mapai Party By the end of the 1920s, Ahdut HaAvoda, with the help of David Ben-Gurion, had won control of the Histadrut. Economic troubles at the end of the 1920s caused the Histadrut to apply intense pressure to Jewish companies which employed Arabs. Many Jews viewed this as a threat to their livelihood. The Histadrut thus faced opposition and Ben-Gurion saw that a united Histadrut would be more powerful against opposition. He thus united Ahdut HaAvoda and Hapoel Hatzair in December 1930 to create the Mapai party, bringing an end to Hapoel Hatzair.Charles D. Smith, Palestine and the Arab-Israeli Conflict, Bedford/St. Martin's, Boston, 2007. , p.122. One of the Hapoel Hatzair leaders who joined the senior levels of Mapai was Haim Arlosoroff. Women's movement Leading female members of Hapoel Hatzair were among some of the leaders of the Jewish feminist movement. While the only female delegates of the first Histadrut were members of Ahdut HaAvoda, members of Hapoel Hatzair, Ada Fishman-Maimon and Yael Gordon, were invited to attend as guests.Dafna N. Izraeli, \\"The Zionist Women's Movement in Palestine, 1911-1927: A Sociological Analysis\\" in Signs, Vol. 7, No. 1 (Autumn, 1981). pp. 87-114. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3173511 , accessed Feb 26, 2009. While there, Ada Maimon, who was a leader in the struggle for women's suffrage in Jewish institutions, objected to the fact that no delegates to the Histadrut had been chosen by female workers and that they therefore did not represent these women. After gaining support of the leading parties, including her own Hapoel Hatzair, she was granted a position at the Histadrut and two seats were then reserved for delegates who had been elected by women workers themselves. Internationally In March 1920, at a congress in Prague, the World Union of Hapoel Hatzair and Zeirei Zion formed Hitahdut Olamit (known as Hitahdut). In 1926, at its Berlin third congress, its name was changed to the World Zionist Labour Party Hitahdut. Its youth movement was named Gordonia, after A. D. Gordon. In 1932, it merged with Poale Zion to create Ihud Olami, the World Union of Zionists-Socialists.Rafael Medoff, Chaim I.

The club was founded on 29 December 1900 for the purpose of playing association football. Its team was one of the early pioneers of the sport in Brazil and was considered the nationally leading side around 1920. To date, Paulistano remains the only club that won the S√£o Paulo state championship four consecutive times. In the course of the professionalisation of the sport in Brazil, the club abandoned the game after 1929. Since then, basketball has developed into the leading sport practised by Paulistano. Further to that, the club these days maintains departments for artistic gymnastics, badminton, basque pelota, boxing, chess, fencing, football, golf, martial arts, rowing, squash, swimming, tennis, track and field, volleyball and waterpolo, among other activities. History Sao Paulo AC in the final of 1905 Campeonato Paulista. The team that won the first Campeonato Paulista for the club in 1905. Under the leadership of the Englishman Charles William Miller representing the S√£o Paulo Athletic Club (SPAC), Paulistano, together with SC Internacional, AA Mackenzie College and SC Germ√¢nia founded in 1901 the Liga Paulista de Foot-Ball (LPF), the first football league in Brazil. In 1902 the first championship of S√£o Paulo was held and the S√£o Paulo Athletic club secured the first three titles, with Paulistano being runner up on each occasion. 1905 was the year when Paulistano won its first championship after all. 1907 Paulistano made the Briton John Hamilton coach of the team, which is believed to be the first appointment of a professional trainer by a Brazilian team.Tony Mason: Passion of the people?: football in South America, Verso, London & New York, 1995 ; p. 24. Further championships followed in 1908 and 1913. In 1914 there was a schism in the football of S√£o Paulo as the LPF was adverse to accepting new members and thus the broadening of the base of the game. Paulistano joined the competing, generally accessible league under the auspices of the Associa√ß√£o Paulista de Esportes Atl√©ticos (APEA). In 1917 the LPF should dissolve and integrate into the APEA, which proved far more attractive. From 1916 to 1919 Paulistano won four consecutive championships, a feat hitherto unrivalled. A major contributor to this success was Arthur Friedenreich, these days counted among the all-time greats of football, who became six times top-scorer of the S√£o Paulo championship during his time with the club. In this era Paulistano also won the Ta√ßa Ioduran of 1918, a cup for the winner of a match between the champions of S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, and in 1920 the Copa dos Campe√µes Estaduais, the Cup of State Champions, which also included the champion of Rio Grande do Sul. In both cases Paulistano defeated Fluminense FC from Rio in the decisive match. St√°de Fran√ßais in 1925. In March and April 1925 Paulistano as first Brazilian side toured continental Europe, a trip that to date forms a major part of the club's folklore. Paulistano, re-inforced with Araken Patusca from Santos FC and three far less prominent players from Rio's CR Flamengo, won nine out of ten matches in France, Switzerland and Portugal, encountering and defeating also the national selections of their first two countries. On the occasion of the match against France in Paris, defeating the hosts 7‚Äì1, Brazilian football was seen as revelation, and Arthur Friedenreich was pronounced by the local press le roi du football, the \\"king of football\\". Arak√©n was described as \\"Le Danger\\". Another one of Paulistano's stars on this tour was Anfilogino \\"Fil√≥\\" Guarisi, who later should play in Italy and win the World Cup of 1934. On their return to S√£o Paulo there was another break up in the state football. Most clubs opted for official professionalisation. Few clubs resisted, among them Paulistano. Under the leadership of Paulistano, the amateur league Liga dos Amadores de Futebol was founded. The fellow footballing pioneers of SC G√™rmania and AA das Palmeiras joined the club from the APEA and played with five other clubs from 1926 in this break-away league. Paulistano won three of the tournaments until 1929, and the SC Internacional, which joined in 1927, won in 1928 its second state title after 1907. However, amateur football proved not viable and with the formal dissolution of the league in early January 1930 Paulistano shut down its football operations, too. By the end of the month some members, sympathisers and players like Friedenreich from Paulistano and AA das Palmeiras joined together to form the S√£o Paulo FC, then known as S√£o Paulo da Floresta, a club which in later years should progress to dominate the world. Stadium Paulistano initially played their home games at Vel√≥dromo, located in S√£o Paulo. The stadium had a maximum capacity of 10,000 people. It was inaugurated on 18 October 1901 for the practice of football, and was demolished in 1916. On 29 December 1917, the club inaugurated a new stadium, named Est√°dio Jardim Am√©rica. It had a maximum capacity of 15,000 people, and was demolished in 1950. Basketball Club Athletico Paulistano has an active men's basketball team. As one of their sponsors is Unimed, the club is named Paulistano/Unimed. The team is one of the basketball teams of Novo Basquete Brasil, the Brazilian basketball league.http://www.lnb.com.br HonoursFootball= * Ta√ßa Ioduran: ** Winners (1): 1918 * Copa dos Campe√µes Estaduais: ** Winners (1): 1920 * Campeonato Paulista: ** Winners (11): 1905, 1908, 1913, 1916, 1917, 1918, 1919, 1921, 1926, 1927, 1929 =Basketball= * Torneio In√≠cio: ** Winners (1): 2004 * Campeonato Paulista: ** Runners-up (1): 2005 Further reading * Nilo Dias: C.A.

Overview The central claim of the paper is that some modern ethical theories fail to account for motive in their theories, producing a sort of schizophrenia because the agent is unable to use his reasons or motives as a basis for his actions. According to Stocker, motive is important to ethics and should be considered as well, rather than only \\"duty, rightness and obligation\\" which he believes are the main focuses of current theories. Stocker believes that this focus is not compatible with the motives required for goods such as love and friendship. Stocker uses the example of a friend visiting you in the hospital. It is nice at first, however he reveals that he chose to spend time with you not out of concern for you in particular, but because he felt it was his moral duty. In this case, we feel that there is something missing in this action‚Äîwe would much prefer to be visited by someone who cares about us directly, not just his duty.

Both families add a shape parameter to the normal distribution. To distinguish the two families, they are referred to below as \\"version 1\\" and \\"version 2\\". However this is not a standard nomenclature. Version 1 Known also as the exponential power distribution, or the generalized error distribution, this is a parametric family of symmetric distributions. It includes all normal and Laplace distributions, and as limiting cases it includes all continuous uniform distributions on bounded intervals of the real line. This family includes the normal distribution when \\\\textstyle\\\\beta=2 (with mean \\\\textstyle\\\\mu and variance \\\\textstyle \\\\frac{\\\\alpha^2}{2}) and it includes the Laplace distribution when \\\\textstyle\\\\beta=1. As \\\\textstyle\\\\beta\\\\rightarrow\\\\infty, the density converges pointwise to a uniform density on \\\\textstyle (\\\\mu-\\\\alpha,\\\\mu+\\\\alpha). This family allows for tails that are either heavier than normal (when \\\\beta<2) or lighter than normal (when \\\\beta>2). It is a useful way to parametrize a continuum of symmetric, platykurtic densities spanning from the normal (\\\\textstyle\\\\beta=2) to the uniform density (\\\\textstyle\\\\beta=\\\\infty), and a continuum of symmetric, leptokurtic densities spanning from the Laplace (\\\\textstyle\\\\beta=1) to the normal density (\\\\textstyle\\\\beta=2). =Parameter estimation= Parameter estimation via maximum likelihood and the method of moments has been studied. The estimates do not have a closed form and must be obtained numerically. Estimators that do not require numerical calculation have also been proposed. The generalized normal log-likelihood function has infinitely many continuous derivates (i.e. it belongs to the class C‚àû of smooth functions) only if \\\\textstyle\\\\beta is a positive, even integer. Otherwise, the function has \\\\textstyle\\\\lfloor \\\\beta \\\\rfloor continuous derivatives. As a result, the standard results for consistency and asymptotic normality of maximum likelihood estimates of \\\\beta only apply when \\\\textstyle\\\\beta\\\\ge 2.  Maximum likelihood estimator  It is possible to fit the generalized normal distribution adopting an approximate maximum likelihood method. With \\\\mu initially set to the sample first moment m_1, \\\\textstyle\\\\beta is estimated by using a Newton‚ÄìRaphson iterative procedure, starting from an initial guess of \\\\textstyle\\\\beta=\\\\textstyle\\\\beta_0, :\\\\beta _0 = \\\\frac{m_1}{\\\\sqrt{m_2}}, where :m_1={1 \\\\over N} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i, is the first statistical moment of the absolute values and m_2 is the second statistical moment. The iteration is :\\\\beta _{i+1} = \\\\beta _{i} - \\\\frac{g(\\\\beta _{i})}{g'(\\\\beta _{i})} , where :g(\\\\beta)= 1 + \\\\frac{\\\\psi(1/\\\\beta)}{\\\\beta} - \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i-\\\\mu^\\\\beta \\\\logx_i-\\\\mu }{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i-\\\\mu^\\\\beta} + \\\\frac{\\\\log( \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{N} \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i-\\\\mu^\\\\beta)}{\\\\beta} , and : \\\\begin{align} g'(\\\\beta) = {} & -\\\\frac{\\\\psi(1/\\\\beta)}{\\\\beta^2} - \\\\frac{\\\\psi'(1/\\\\beta)}{\\\\beta^3} + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta^2} - \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i-\\\\mu^\\\\beta (\\\\logx_i-\\\\mu)^2}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i-\\\\mu^\\\\beta} \\\\[6pt] & {} + \\\\frac{\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i-\\\\mu^\\\\beta \\\\logx_i-\\\\mu\\\\right)^2}{\\\\left(\\\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i-\\\\mu^\\\\beta \\\\right)^2} + \\\\frac{\\\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i-\\\\mu^\\\\beta \\\\logx_i-\\\\mu}{\\\\beta \\\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i-\\\\mu^\\\\beta} \\\\[6pt] & {} - \\\\frac{\\\\log\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{N} \\\\sum_{i=1}^N x_i-\\\\mu^\\\\beta \\\\right)}{\\\\beta^2}, \\\\end{align} and where \\\\psi and \\\\psi' are the digamma function and trigamma function. Given a value for \\\\textstyle\\\\beta, it is possible to estimate \\\\mu by finding the minimum of: : \\\\min_\\\\mu = \\\\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i-\\\\mu^\\\\beta Finally \\\\textstyle\\\\alpha is evaluated as :\\\\alpha = \\\\left( \\\\frac{\\\\beta}{N} \\\\sum_{i=1}^Nx_i-\\\\mu^\\\\beta\\\\right)^{1/\\\\beta} . For \\\\beta \\\\leq 1, median is a more appropriate estimator of \\\\mu . Once \\\\mu is estimated, \\\\beta and \\\\alpha can be estimated as described above. =Applications= This version of the generalized normal distribution has been used in modeling when the concentration of values around the mean and the tail behavior are of particular interest. Other families of distributions can be used if the focus is on other deviations from normality. If the symmetry of the distribution is the main interest, the skew normal family or version 2 of the generalized normal family discussed below can be used. If the tail behavior is the main interest, the student t family can be used, which approximates the normal distribution as the degrees of freedom grows to infinity. The t distribution, unlike this generalized normal distribution, obtains heavier than normal tails without acquiring a cusp at the origin. =Properties= Moments  Let X_\\\\beta be zero mean generalized Gaussian distribution of shape \\\\beta and scaling parameter \\\\alpha . The moments of X_\\\\beta exist and are finite for any k greater than ‚àí1. For any non-negative integer k, the plain central moments are Saralees Nadarajah (2005) A generalized normal distribution, Journal of Applied Statistics, 32:7, 685-694, DOI: 10.1080/02664760500079464 : \\\\operatorname{E}\\\\left[X^k_\\\\beta\\\\right] = \\\\begin{cases} 0 & \\\\text{if }k\\\\text{ is odd,}  \\\\alpha^{k} \\\\Gamma \\\\left( \\\\frac{k+1}{\\\\beta} \\\\right) \\\\Big/ \\\\, \\\\Gamma \\\\left( \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta} \\\\right) & \\\\text{if }k\\\\text{ is even.} \\\\end{cases} Connection to Positive-Definite Functions  The probability density function of this version of the generalized normal distribution is a positive-definite function for \\\\beta \\\\in (0,2].

(1997) Regional frequency analysis: an approach based on L-moments, Cambridge University Press. . Section A.8Documentation for the lmomco R package When the shape parameter is zero, the normal distribution results. Positive values of the shape parameter yield left-skewed distributions bounded to the right, and negative values of the shape parameter yield right-skewed distributions bounded to the left. Only when the shape parameter is zero is the density function for this distribution positive over the whole real line: in this case the distribution is a normal distribution, otherwise the distributions are shifted and possibly reversed log-normal distributions. =Parameter estimation= Parameters can be estimated via maximum likelihood estimation or the method of moments. The parameter estimates do not have a closed form, so numerical calculations must be used to compute the estimates. Since the sample space (the set of real numbers where the density is non-zero) depends on the true value of the parameter, some standard results about the performance of parameter estimates will not automatically apply when working with this family. =Applications= This family of distributions can be used to model values that may be normally distributed, or that may be either right-skewed or left-skewed relative to the normal distribution. The skew normal distribution is another distribution that is useful for modeling deviations from normality due to skew. Other distributions used to model skewed data include the gamma, lognormal, and Weibull distributions, but these do not include the normal distributions as special cases. Other distributions related to the normal The two generalized normal families described here, like the skew normal family, are parametric families that extends the normal distribution by adding a shape parameter. Due to the central role of the normal distribution in probability and statistics, many distributions can be characterized in terms of their relationship to the normal distribution. For example, the log-normal, folded normal, and inverse normal distributions are defined as transformations of a normally-distributed value, but unlike the generalized normal and skew-normal families, these do not include the normal distributions as special cases. Actually all distributions with finite variance are in the limit highly related to the normal distribution. The Student-t distribution, the Irwin‚ÄìHall distribution and the Bates distribution also extend the normal distribution, and include in the limit the normal distribution. So there is no strong reason to prefer the \\"generalized\\" normal distribution of type 1, e.g. over a combination of Student-t and a normalized extended Irwin‚ÄìHall ‚Äì this would include e.g. the triangular distribution (which cannot be modeled by the generalized Gaussian type 1). A symmetric distribution which can model both tail (long and short) and center behavior (like flat, triangular or Gaussian) completely independently could be derived e.g. by using X = IH/chi.

It stars Martin Sheen, Sam Waterston and Harvey Keitel. It was directed by Anthony Harvey, with a story by Michael Syson and a screenplay by John Briley. It won the British Society of Cinematographers Best Cinematography Award for 1979. Plot The story has three plot strands that run concurrently through the film: a stagecoach carrying a rich widow home to her family's hacienda, a war party of Indians returning to their village, and two fur traders waiting to meet a different group of Indians with whom they trade. The war party attacks the other Indians and kills their leader, who owns a magnificent white stallion. White Bull (Waterston) attempts to capture the horse, but it is too quick and makes off carrying the dead chief. Pike (Sheen) and Henry (Keitel) wait in vain for the traders and are then attacked themselves by the war party. Henry is killed, the Indians take the trader's horses, and Pike is left alone with only a mule. Travelling alone, he comes across the funeral of the dead chief. He saves the white stallion from ritual slaughter, abandons his mule, and continues his travels. The Medicine Man conducting the ritual is accidentally killed while Pike is taking the horse. The war party finds the stage coach, attacks it, kills the driver, guard, and one of the passengers, and then leaves White Bull to ransack the coach and passengers of all valuables. White Bull gathers a hoard of jewels and other valuable items, takes a white girl for himself, and leaves the other survivors standing in the desert. One of the survivors, a priest, takes a coach horse and rides off to alert the hacienda. The story then becomes a four-way chase. After gaining the white stallion from Pike, White Bull, the girl, the treasure and the stallion continue towards the native's village; Pike goes after the stallion; a posse from the hacienda sets out to recover the coach passengers and the girl, and members of the Medicine Man's tribe seek to avenge his death. After a series of to-and-fro adventures, the film ends as White Bull rides off alone with the stallion while Pike, utterly defeated, stands and watches him go; the girl is still behind Pike, waiting to be rescued.

Director Anthony Harvey said Syson \\"wrote it as kind of a short story, a series of ideas with a very strong story line but not really a script.\\" The film attracted Harvey \\"as a chance to break away from the subjects I have done before, really to have complete freedom. It was a film with a very thin script in a way but it had a very strong story. It didn't have much detail and no dialogue at all, except for the first ten minutes between Harvey Keitel and Sam Waterston. It was very much a director's subject.\\" Harvey said \\"The moment I read Eagle's Wing I knew very clearly the kind of things I wanted visually, and talked to Billy Williams for days about it.\\" Harvey says he and John Briley sat down and wrote a script \\"for about a month before we went on location, just to make sense of it.\\" The film was shot in nine weeks in and around Durango, Mexico in early 1978, finishing by April. Harvey says this was \\"short but we had the luxury of a small unit.\\" Harvey said they would go \\"three or four hours out of\\" Durango. \\"We were looking for desolate landscapes. The movie is about loneliness and people who don't communicate... We didn't want any romantic David Lean sunsets but rather black and threatening skies.\\" He looked for unusual landscapes that appeared \\"like the surface of the moon\\". Harvey says after filming was complete and he was on another project, Players, \\"the money people came in and... made a number of cuts and put back some things I had cut out.\\" Reception The film was released in England in 1979. Harvey said \\"the reviews couldn't have been better if I'd written them myself.\\" The Observer called it \\"dazzling\\" and The Guardian saying it was \\"well worth seeing\\". However the film was not a commercial success and it was a number of years before it was released in the US to varied reviews. It was one of the last movies financed by the Rank Organisation.

The term is widely used in the realm of exploitation of hydrocarbon-based resources. The play cycle normally exhibits the following steps: # initial observations of a possible oil reserve # testing and adjustments to initial estimates of extraction # high success in locating and extracting oil from a reserve # lower success as the reserve is depleted # continued decrease in further exploration of the region A particular stratigraphic or structural geologic setting is also often known as a play. For example, in a relatively unexplored area (such as the Falkland Islands) one might speak of the \\"Paleozoic play\\" to refer to the potential oil reserves that might be found within Paleozoic strata. In a well-explored basin such as the Gulf of Mexico, explorers refer to the \\"Wilcox play\\" or the \\"Norphlet play\\" to collectively designate the production and possible production from those particular geological formations, of Paleocene and Jurassic age respectivelyhttps://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2017/1111/ofr20171111.pdf. A play may also be a broad category of possible reservoirs or rock types, as in the turbidite play of offshore Angola or the carbonate play in the East Java Sea, or to the structural geology of the setting, as in the sub-upthrust play of Wyoming. Sometimes the word play is applied to a geographic area with hydrocarbon potential, as the South Texas play or the Niger Delta play, but usually \\"play\\" is used with the sense of restricting discussion to exploring a particular geologic setting. Thus one might have both the Wilcox play and the Norphlet play (among others) in partially overlapping areas of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico; the Gulf of Mexico deep-water play might or might not include elements or particular locations appropriate to either the Wilcox or the Norphlet, or both. The term is one of convenience for discussion, and may refer to geologic time intervals, rock types, structures, or some combination of them.

(initialized as CAQH) is a non-profit organization incorporated in California as a mutual benefit corporation. It was first incorporated under the name Coalition for Affordable, Quality Healthcare, Inc., and then was renamed the Council for Affordable Quality Healthcare, Inc. on July 22, 1998. It is based in Washington, D.C.. Previously a 501(c)6 tax-exempt organization, CAQH changed its tax status in 2016, although it remains a non-profit. Its mission is to accelerate the transformation of business processes in healthcare through collaboration, innovation and a commitment to ensuring value across stakeholders, including healthcare providers, trade associations, and health plans. Initiatives CAQH has created a number of initiatives to streamline the business of healthcare: CAQH CORE, CAQH Solutions, and CAQH Explorations. CAQH Solutions include CAQH ProView, DirectAssure, CAQH VeriFide, SanctionsTrack, EnrollHub, and COB Smart. CAQH Explorations, the research arm of CAQH, includes the CAQH Index. =CAQH CORE= Established in 2005, CAQH CORE (the Committee on Operating Rules for Information Exchange) is a multi- stakeholder collaboration of more than 140 organizations ‚Äì providers, health plans, vendors, government agencies and standard-setting bodies ‚Äì committed to the development and adoption of national operating rules for administrative transactions within the healthcare industry. CAQH CORE participating organizations include health plans representing more than 75% of commercially insured lives, plus Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) mandated better standardization of the electronic HIPAA administrative and financial transactions between providers and insurers. In 2012, CAQH CORE was designated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) as an author for ACA-mandated operating rules. Operating rules support a range of existing standards to make electronic data transactions more predictable and consistent, regardless of technology used. The CAQH CORE process centers on an integrated model consisting of rule development, testing and certification, outreach and tracking measures. In 2012‚Äì2013, the organization released operating rules for four transactions now federally mandated for all HIPAA-covered entities: eligibility, claim status, electronic funds transfer and remittance advice (EFT/ERA). In 2015, it announced additional voluntary operating rules for healthcare claims, prior authorization, employee premium payment and employee enrollment and disenrollment. To drive and track market adoption, CAQH CORE offers a voluntary certification program so organizations can demonstrate that they have adopted and are adhering to the operating rules. Organizations that create, use or transmit administrative healthcare data (such as health plans, healthcare providers and vendors) can earn CORE Certification. In a January 2014 proposed rule, HHS recommended CAQH CORE as the administrator for HHS- required certification of health plans.\\"Administrative Simplification: Certification of Compliance for Health Plans.‚Äù Department of Health and Human Services. January 2014. =CAQH ProView= Launched in 2002 and formerly known as the Universal Provider Datasource¬Æ, CAQH ProView is used by more than 1.4 million healthcare providers to self-report professional and demographic information. Health plans, hospitals and provider groups may utilize this information for provider credentialing, network directories and claims payments. Use of CAQH ProView reduces time and resources needed for these processes; it can also minimize manual error and reduce duplicative paperwork and administrative costs. =DirectAssure= DirectAssure works in concert with CAQH ProView to enable providers to self-report and regularly attest to their professional and practice information. =VeriFide= The provider credential verification solution integrates with CAQH ProView to standardize the credentialing process by which health plans and healthcare organizations verify provider data. =SanctionsTrack= SanctionsTrack, an add-on feature to CAQH ProView, is an automated, continuous sanctions monitoring solution that reviews multi-state information on provider licensure disciplinary actions. SanctionsTrack helps organizations eliminate redundant data gathering and follow-up research for sanction notices. =EnrollHub= Increasing adoption of electronic funds transfer (EFT) and electronic remittance advice (ERA) enrollment continues to challenge healthcare organizations. To simplify this process, CAQH launched EnrollHub in 2013 to offer providers a single enrollment process for EFT and ERA with multiple payers. Providers complete the standardized, electronic enrollment form and select the health plans with which they do business. CAQH notifies the health plans of the enrollment, and the health plan then accesses the provider's banking information. Enroll hub has been unavailable since 1/9/2019 =COB Smart= Used by health plans and clearinghouses, COB Smart helps identify instances of patients with overlapping insurance coverage. This CAQH Solution determines which individuals have benefits that should be coordinated, as well as which health plans are primary and secondary insurers, so that corresponding claims can be processed correctly the first time. COB Smart launched in 2014. =CAQH Explorations= CAQH Explorations is the research arm of the CAQH. It includes the CAQH Index, which tracks and reports progress by the healthcare industry in its ongoing transition from manual to electronic administrative transactions. The findings of the CAQH Index are based on an analysis of an extensive dataset of administrative transactions between providers and health plans. The 2014 CAQH Index reported that providers and health plans could potentially save $9.4 billion if they fully adopted electronic transactions. Membership Members include Aetna, Anthem, America's Health Insurance Plans, AultCare, the BlueCross BlueShield Association, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, BlueCross BlueShield of North Carolina, BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield, Centene Corporation, Cigna, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, Kaiser Permanente, Priority Health in Michigan, Indiana & Ohio (primarily), and UnitedHealth Group.

Williams (October 21, 1917 - September 4, 2009) was born at Pecos, Texas and earned a B.B.A. at the University of Texas at Austin in 1938. In June 1941 Williams was commissioned an ensign in the United States Navy Reserve but would transfer to the regular active duty Navy in 1943. He was present on Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, during the Japanese attack. For the duration of World War II, Williams served in the Pacific theater at Pearl Harbor and Tarawa. In the immediate postwar period, Williams was a faculty member at the Naval War College and later served as assistant to the Chief of Naval Operations and the United States Secretary of the Navy. From 1958 to 1961, Williams was a member of Dwight D. Eisenhower's White House staff as assistant to Eisenhower's Naval aid Captain Evan P. Aurand. It was during this period that Williams (also working as a speechwriter) and Malcolm Moos coined the term \\"military-industrial complex\\" that Eisenhower used in his farewell address.Griffin, Charles \\"New Light on Eisenhower's Farewell Address,\\" in Presidential Studies Quarterly 22 (Summer 1992): 469-479James C.

Osborne, 557 U.S. 52 (2009),. was a case in which the United States Supreme Court decided that the Constitution's due process clause does not require states to turn over DNA evidence to a party seeking a civil suit under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983.. Background The case concerned the conviction of William G. Osborne on charges related to the rape and beating of a prostitute. The prostitute had been beaten with an axe handle, shot in the head, and left in an Alaskan snowbank. On a combination of eyewitness testimony and DNA evidence from a condom found at the scene, Osborne was convicted of kidnapping and sexual assault. He was sentenced to 26 years in prison for these offenses. The testing method used on the condom, DQ Alpha, was a relatively inexact form of DNA testing that generally cannot narrow the perpetrator down to less than 5% of the population. After his conviction, Osborne sought for the state's evidence to be put to Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (RFLP) testing according to his rights under Alaska Statute ¬ß12.72.010(4) (2008) for postconviction relief, and according to his State and Federal Constitution rights. The Alaska Court of Appeals ruled Osborne had neither Federal constitutional right to postconviction testing, due to lack of precedent, nor a State constitutional right, on the basis that the other evidence of his guilt was too strong and RFLP testing was not likely to be conclusive. Alaska prosecutors do not dispute that advanced DNA testing could potentially prove Osborne's innocence beyond any doubt, but refused to allow him additional testing despite a decade-old request. Following the refusal, Osborne filed suit, claiming the state violated his right to due process.See 42 U.S.C. ¬ß1983 In this suit, Osborne challenged the state's \\"deprivation of any rights . . . secured by the Constitution\\" and requested the DNA evidence against him be tested at his personal expense by Short Tandem Repeat (STR) analysis, a method more discriminating than both RFLP and DQ Alpha, and unavailable at the time of his trial. The State instead insisted that Osborne's claim must be brought under 28 U.S.C. ¬ß2254, which allows a prisoner to seek \\"a writ of habeas corpus . . . on the ground that he is in custody in violation of the Constitution.\\" Osborne argued against this approach, as access to evidence, or even vindication through said access, would not automatically invalidate his conviction. The case was ultimately brought before the Supreme Court, which overturned a Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals judgement in Osborne's favor and ruled that \\"assuming Osborne‚Äôs claims can be pursued using ¬ß1983, he has no constitutional right to obtain postconviction access to the State‚Äôs evidence for DNA testing.\\" Opinion of the Court Chief Justice Roberts delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Justices Scalia, Kennedy, Thomas, and Alito joined. Justice Alito filed a concurring opinion, in which Justice Kennedy joined, and in which Justice Thomas joined as to Part II. In the majority opinion, the Supreme Court found that Alaska provided for discovery in postconviction proceedings, and has through judicial decision, specified that such discovery is available to those seeking access to evidence for DNA testing. The Court decided these procedures are similar to those provided by federal law and the laws of other States, and they satisfy due process. Osbourne brought this case under section 1983 without ever using procedures in filing a state or federal habeas claim relying on actual innocence. The Court found he had not tried to use the process provided to him by the State or attempted to vindicate the liberty interest that was disputed in this case. As such, the Court found no substantive due process rights infringed. Justice Stevens filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justices Ginsburg and Breyer joined, and in which Justice Souter joined as to Part I. Justice Stevens found Osborne made full use of available state procedures in his efforts to secure access to evidence for DNA testing so that he might avail himself of the postconviction relief afforded by the State of Alaska, but that he was repeatedly rebuffed in a manner which left doubt about the adequacy of the procedural protections afforded to litigants under Alaska Stat. ¬ß12.72.010(4), and which proved contrary to the majority assertion that Osborne could gain access to the evidence were he simply to seek it through the State's discovery procedures. Justice Souter filed a separate dissenting opinion on procedural grounds, arguing that while Alaska had facially reasonable conditions guaranteeing access to DNA evidence, the way it went about applying those conditions added up to procedural unfairness that violated the Due Process Clause. Analysis and commentary Some consider the decision to be a rebuke of the Innocence Project, which offered to fund Osborne's DNA testing and exonerated 240 prisoners as of the date of the decision. Additionally, former FBI Director William S. Sessions was among those who sought to have the evidence revealed, arguing the Justice Department should intervene and demand testing since the department's very name implies \\"justice\\". He wrote \\"Why should our criminal justice system be afraid?\\"  See also *List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 557 *List of United States Supreme Court cases ReferencesExternal links * * District Attorney's Office for the Third Judicial District, et al. v.

It originated with the martyrdom of the Martyrs of Abitinae, who were murdered in AD 304 when Roman Emperor Diocletian prohibited Christians under penalty of death to possess the Sacred Scriptures, convene on Sunday to celebrate the Holy Eucharist, and erect premises for their assemblies. The phrase was not intended to express incapacity but, on the contrary, absolute moral determination to obey the Catholic Faith. The full sentence of the phrase is \\"sine dominico non possumus\\" (\\"we cannot [live] without Sunday\\"). It expresses the necessity of Sunday and the Holy Eucharist for Christianity.Pope to Proclaim Cry of Abitene Martyrs Another ecclesiastic use of the phrase has been attributed to Pope Leo the Great, who wrote in AD 448 that \\"quibus viventibus non communicavimus mortuis communicare non possumus\\" (\\"we cannot hold communion in death with those who in life were not in communion with us\\"). Recourse to this principle has been had to justify various ecclesiastical practices, including refusal of funeral liturgies and refusal of abrogating the ex-communication of decedents. Some have used it to object to ecumenism and general relations with non-Christians.Diocese of Brooklyn Denies Funeral Mass for Gotti In the 19th and 20th centuries, \\"non possumus\\" denominated the diplomacy of Popes Pius IX, Leo XIII, St. Pius X, Benedict XV, Pius XI, and Pius XII, especially after the capture of Rome when the Supreme Pontiff became the prisoner in the Vatican and chose to limit his contact with the outside world.Pius IX revisited It is generally thought that the Second Vatican Council reversed this attitude. This Latin phrase is also connected with the history of Poland. On 8 May 1953 Polish bishops sent a formal letter to the party leaders of the communist People's Republic of Poland to declare their decisive refusal to subordinate the Church to the communist state. In retaliation, the government imprisoned their Primate, Cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski.

Hayes, 555 U.S. 415 (2009), is a United States Supreme Court case interpreting Section 921(a)(33)(A) of the federal Gun Control Act of 1968, as amended in 1996. The Court held that a domestic relationship is not necessarily a defining element of the predicate offense to support a conviction for possession of a firearm by a person previously convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence. Background The Gun Control Act had long prohibited convicted felons from owning firearms. In 1996 the Act was amendedSection 922(g), defining the categories of persons to whom the ban extended, was expanded to add a new category under Section 922(g)(9), which included \\"a person convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic violence\\" within the firearms possession prohibition. In addition, a definition of \\"crime of domestic violence\\" was added as a new Section 933(a)(33)(A). to extend this prohibition to persons convicted of a \\"misdemeanor crime of domestic violence.\\" The question before the Court was the statutory meaning of this prohibition, and how far it extended: did it require a state to have a specific statute that prohibited misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence, under which a person charged with an Act violation was convicted ? Or did it only require that a person was convicted of a misdemeanor which in fact constituted \\"domestic violence,\\" without regard to whether the misdemeanor statute specifically proscribed crimes of \\"domestic violence\\"? Facts and Issues The facts of the Hayes case illustrate the distinction. In 1994 Hayes had been convicted in West Virginia of the misdemeanor of simple battery. The offense was committed against his wife in a domestic dispute. In 2004, the police found him in possession of firearms. Had he violated the Act? The prosecution claimed the 1994 conviction for simple battery was sufficient to place him under the federal firearms ban. He had been convicted of a violent misdemeanor (battery) under state law. And the battery was, in fact, against his wife. This was enough, the prosecution alleged, to make that a conviction of a predicate crime of \\"domestic violence\\" which would, accordingly, bring him within the scope of the federal prohibition. Hayes claimed that more was required before he was subject to the federal firearms possession ban of the Gun Control Act. He argued that the state must have a statute that specifically defined and prohibited \\"domestic violence\\" as an independent crime; a person convicted of that crime would then be subject to the federal prohibition under Act, but a person only convicted of another crime - such as simple battery - would not be so subjected. Hayes agreed the person he battered was, in fact, his wife; but in 1994 the state of West Virginia did not have a statute that prohibited \\"domestic violence\\" as a specific crime. Therefore, Hayes argued, it was in effect legally impossible for him to be banned from firearm possession under the \\"domestic violence\\" extension for acts committed within West Virginia. Hayes moved to dismiss the federal indictment but the trial court denied his motion. He entered a guilty plea, subject to his right to appeal the motion's denial, and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed with Hayes on appeal. It decided that the state misdemeanor law must contain, as an element of the crime, a \\"domestic relationship between the offender and the victim,\\" 482 F.3d 749, 751 (2007), and that the indictment was indeed faulty. The Supreme Court then accepted the case to resolve a split among the circuits. Supreme Court decision The Supreme Court agreed with the Government that the indictment was sufficient and that the Fourth Circuit's interpretation of the Gun Control amendments was erroneous.

The potential could be the electrostatic potential among N point charges i.e. molecular dynamics, the gravitational potential among N gas particles in e.g. smoothed particle hydrodynamics, or any other useful function. It is based on the particle mesh method, where particles are interpolated onto a grid, and the potential is solved for this grid (e.g. by solving the discrete Poisson equation). This interpolation introduces errors in the force calculation, particularly for particles that are close together. Essentially, the particles are forced to have a lower spatial resolution during the force calculation. The P3M algorithm attempts to remedy this by calculating the potential through a direct sum for particles that are close, and through the particle mesh method for particles that are separated by some distance.

The parish of Walsoken in the 2001 census, has a population of 1,484 rising slightly to 1,489 at the 2011 Census. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of King's Lynn and West Norfolk. History The name Walsoken is thought to originate from the Old English meaning the district under particular jurisdiction by the wallA Popular Guide to Norfolk Place-names: by James Rye: Published by Larks press, Dereham, Norfolk, 2000 ; which refers to the villages proximity to a Roman sea wall or defence. =Roman settlement= Archaeological evidence has found that much of the land of Walsoken of pre-Roman occupation was completely submerged beneath the Iron Age silts. As such, very little early prehistoric archaeology has been recorded. It is thought that some dry land existed within the parish in the Bronze Age as several artefacts from that time period were uncovered in the 19th century. There has been a lot more archaeological evidence found to attest to Roman occupation in the parish, including a dispersed hoard of 300 to 400 Roman coins, mostly of Postumus, but including examples minted by Gallienus and Hostilian which were found via metal detecting in the 1980s. =Medieval period= Ailwin (or Aethelwine), earl of East Anglia, gave 5 hides at Walsoken to Ramsey Abbey. The principal manor of Walsoken was Popenhoe and originally belonged to Ramsey Abbey. The settlement's population, land ownership and productive resources were detailed in its entry in the Domesday Book of 1085.The Domesday Book, Englands Heritage, Then and Now, Editor: Thomas Hinde, Norfolk page 196, Walsoken, In the great book Walsoken is recorded by the name 'Walsocam', which was held by the Benedictine Order based at Ramsey Abbey before and after 1066. The survey also records the presence of a fishery. In 1286 Desiderata grand-daughter of Sir Stephen de Maresco, Lord of Newton, Walsoken and Tidd St Giles married Sir Roger de Colvile. There was Guild of the Assumption of our Lady, a Guild of St Thomas the Martyr, a Guild of the Nativity of our Lady, a Guild of St John and a Guild of the Trinity according to the will of Thomas Honiter (1513). =Amalgamation with Wisbech= The county boundary between Norfolk and the Isle of Ely based on the old course of the Welle Stream through the built-up area, dividing up roads and streets haphazardly. Wisbech and Walsoken were amalgamated in April 1934 ‚Äì a boundary marker stone in Wisbech Park records the event and bears the names - Joseph Smith, Mayor of Wisbech and Thomas Burling, Warden of Walsoken. Part of the ecclesiastical parish was transferred to the Isle of Ely from Norfolk. As a result the church remains in Norfolk and the village hall, cemetery, schools and most shops are now in the New Walsoken part of Wisbech. Geography The village and parish of Walsoken is situated in the west of Norfolk on the border with Cambridgeshire ‚Äì most of the original village now lies in Cambridgeshire but All Saints Church lies in Norfolk. Entrance to Norfolk at Walsoken, Wisbech on the Cambridgeshire and Norfolk County boundary. The village is a suburb of the fenland town of Wisbech and its ancient character and historic core have been surrounded by modern housing. The parish is south of West Walton, north of Emneth and west of Marshland St James. Walsoken is approximately west-north-west of Norwich, west-south-west of King's Lynn and north of London. The suburb and parish is east-north-east of the centre of Wisbech. Walsoken is to the east of the B198 which was the old A47 renumbered in 1984 with the opening of the Wisbech bypass.County A to Z Atlas, Street & Road maps Norfolk, page 230 The nearest railway station is at Downham Market for the Fen Line which runs between King's Lynn and Cambridge. The nearest airport is Norwich International Airport. LandmarksAll Saints Parish Church= All Saints' Church in Walsoken is a Grade I listed building and consists of a nave with south and north aisles, chancel with south and north chapels, south porch The nave and chancel are both late Norman and date from c.1146.Norfolk 2: Norfolk: North- west and South, By Nikolaus Pevsner and Bill Wilson, Walsoken entry. 0-300-09657-7 Above the chancel arch is a 15th-century carving of King David with harp. This church is crowned by a prominent west tower with four turrets and a spire which dates from the medieval period.The King's England series, NORFOLK, by Arthur Mee, Pub: Hodder and Stoughton, 1972, page 323/324, Walsoken, To the base of the tower is the rounded Norman west doorway. The interior of the church has massive Norman arcades which are rich with zigzag moulding decoration. An arch in the chancel is supported on carved banded shafts. On one side is the 15th-century doorway to the old rood loft. The nave roof has painted angels and other figures in delicately canopied niches. There are 15th-century screens in both aisles, one with most intricate tracery, stalls with carved heads, battered figures on old benches, and over the tower arch two paintings of the judgement of Solomon with a statue of a king enthroned between them. The Seven Sacrament font is 400 years plus old. This pre-Reformation font is decorated with sculptures of the crucifixion and seven sacraments (these are; Baptism, Confession, Confirmation, Last Rites, Mass, Matrimony and Ordination), eight saints under rich canopies (these are; Catherine, Paul, John, Magdala, Steven, Margaret, Peter and Dorothea), and round the base this inscription to those friends of the church who gave it: \\"Remember the souls of S. Honyter and Margaret his wife, and John Benforth, Chaplain 1544\\". One child baptised at this font grew up to be archbishop of Canterbury. He was the Rector's boy, Thomas Herring, who became archbishop in 1747, and a little while before he died put a tablet in the chancel here \\"in grateful memory of his excellent parents\\". He was a man of immense enthusiasm and full of generosity. There are several later window insertions throughout. The church's bell tower has six bells made by Thomas Osborn in Downham Market in 1795. Originally the bells were hung in a frame adjacent to the louvres in the tower. The bells were restored and re-hung in 1901 by the children of Richard Young, M.P. for Cambridgeshire, and further work was undertaken in 1956 when the bells were re-hung in a lower position in the tower in an eight bell metal frame. This was to allow for the future provision of two additional bells, which has not to date been achieved. =Church gallery= File:All Saints Walsoken 20080721-03.jpgThe arch chancel supported on carved banded shafts File:All Saints Walsoken 20080721-18.jpgThe 400-year-old Seven Sacrament font File:All Saints Walsoken 20080721-13.jpgThe nave roof with painted angels and other figures Notable People Names are in birth order.

Sport A short lived greyhound racing track called the Wheatley Bank Sports Stadium existed between 1939 and 1948. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks. The track on Lynn Road could only accommodate 500 spectators and is reported to have reopened on 10 July 1948 meaning it had closed at some stage after 1939.

Recorded at Chapel Studios in South Thoresby, Chez Bez and Tackle Out Studios in London, and the El Relaxo villa in Mijas, Spain, it was produced by the band's lead guitarist Luke Morley. The album was released in the UK by STC Recordings on 30 October 2006, in Europe by Frontiers Records on 10 November, and in Japan by Victor Entertainment on 26 February 2007. Thunder began working on material for the follow-up to The Magnificent Seventh! in November 2005, during the promotional touring cycle for the album. After the final run of shows on the tour ended in February 2006, the band continued work on the album at a rented villa in Mijas, M√°laga using a portable Pro Tools recording station purchased a few years previous. The group's second guitarist and keyboardist Ben Matthews engineered and mixed the entire record. Robert Johnson's Tombstone debuted at number 56 on the UK Albums Chart and number 6 on the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart. \\"The Devil Made Me Do It\\" was released as the only single from the album on 4 December 2006, reaching number 40 on the UK Singles Chart and number 2 on the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart. The album was promoted on a concert tour between November 2006 and September 2007, featuring shows in the UK, Europe and Japan. Recording and production Thunder started the \\"first stage of recording\\" for their eighth studio album on 29 November 2005, shortly before embarking on the second European leg of the tour for their seventh studio album, The Magnificent Seventh!, on 6 December. Production took place at Chapel Studios in South Thoresby, Lincolnshire, Chez Bez and Tackle Out Studios in London, and a rented villa in Mijas, M√°laga, Spain called \\"El Relaxo\\". The Mijas sessions took place in early 2006 and saw the group using a portable recording setup they had purchased a couple of years prior. Speaking about the system, the band's vocalist Danny Bowes recalled that \\"We spent a lot of money on a portable Pro Tools system so that we could plug everything in and record ... I knew how useful it would be to have the ability to record and mix our own records anywhere we wanted.\\" Recalling how he conceived the concept for Robert Johnson's Tombstone, the band's lead guitarist, producer and primary songwriter Luke Morley explained that it \\"came about when I was helping Andy Taylor's son ... with some demos and advice, down in Exeter. I was driving home and listening to one of those late-night Radio 2 programmes about the blues. The guy was talking about the blues musician Robert Johnson and the stories of a bottle of poison, a bottle of whisky and a prostitute being involved in his death, and I thought, \\"This is so rock 'n' roll!\\" So I got home and started researching Johnson, and it went from there.\\" The album's opening title track features lyrics written in reference to Johnson's mysterious death ‚Äì Morley recalls that \\"all the ingredients in his story, true or false, make it a great one to tell and embellish\\". Prior to its release, Bowes dubbed the album \\"a natural continuation of the last record\\", describing its sound as \\"rootsy and blues based, sexy and dirty, and sad and melancholy in places too\\". Promotion and release Robert Johnson's Tombstone was released in the UK by the band's own label STC Recordings on 30 October 2006. It debuted at number 56 on the UK Albums Chart, number 6 on the UK Rock & Metal Albums Chart, and number 61 on the Scottish Albums Chart. The album was released in Europe by Frontiers Records on 10 November, and in Japan by Victor Entertainment on 26 February 2007, with four additional bonus tracks. Outside of the UK, it reached number 105 on the Oricon Albums Chart in Japan ‚Äì the first Thunder studio album to chart in the region. \\"The Devil Made Me Do It\\" was released as the only single from Robert Johnson's Tombstone on 4 December 2006. It was the band's 18th and to date latest release to reach the top 40 of the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 40. It also reached number 2 on the UK Rock & Metal Singles Chart, behind Muse's \\"Knights of Cydonia\\". The album was promoted on a concert tour beginning in the UK in November 2006, including dates in Europe and Japan. Critical reception Reviewing the album for AllMusic, Stewart Mason claimed that on Robert Johnson's Tombstone, \\"Thunder return to what made them, if not famous, then at least reasonably well known in certain circles: punchy three-chord hard rock delivered with maximum swagger and minimum fuss\\". Highlighting tracks such as \\"Andy Warhol Said\\" and \\"Last Man Standing\\", the writer concluded that \\"While [the album] won't win Thunder any new acolytes, fans will be entirely pleased\\".

They had a 3.5-inch diameter and a non- explosive warhead, since they were used as an aircraft-launched ASW (Anti- Submarine Warfare) rocket and worked by puncturing the hull. It was accurate enough for use against surface ships and land targets, but these missions required an explosive warhead.Parsch 2004 A 5-inch anti-aircraft shell was attached to the 3.5-inch rocket motor, creating the 5-Inch FFAR, which entered service in December 1943. Performance was limited because of the increased weight, limiting speed to 780 km/h (485 mph).Parsch 2006 The High Velocity Aircraft Rocket, or HVAR, was developed to fix this flaw.

A third approach, content or theme-based language instruction (CBI) has also been confused with LSP. These several uses of the label of LSP have caused some confusion internationally. Education and training LSP is a widely applied approach to second or foreign language teaching and training that addresses immediate and very specific needs of learners who need that language as a tool in their education, training or job. Needs analysis is the underlying \\"driver\\" for the development of LSP programs.Hutchinson & Waters 1987, Robinson 1980, Swales, 185, 1992, Hyland 2002 For example, English native speaking nurses who work in hospitals with a high percentage patient whose native language is Spanish might have to study Spanish for the very specific purpose of communication between nurses and patients. Students are encouraged to take active roles in their own learning and question what they have been taught. This is likened to negotiated syllabus about which Hyland (2009)Hyland, K. (2009). Specific purpose programs. In M. H. Long & C. J. Doughty (eds.), The handbook of language teaching (pp. 201-217). Singapore:Wiley-Blackwell. writes, \\"A negotiated syllabus means that the content of a particular course is a matter of discussion between teacher and students, according to the wishes and needs of the learners in conjunction with the expertise, judgement, and advice of the teacher\\" (p. 208). Research \\"Language for specific purposes\\" has also been used to refer to a branch of applied linguistics which deals with a variety of language used by members of a particular subject field, concentrating on its genres, stylistic features and technical lexis. This research is relevant for such problem-based areas as language education, translation and the design of specialised dictionaries. Some in the training area consider such research on Professional Communications as LSP-related research when it is paired with or applied directly to an LSP training program. Relationship to content-based instruction Content-based language instruction (CBI) is also sometimes confused with ESP. At the post-secondary level it is frequently used to motivate groups of learners who may be interested in the same professional field, providing meaningful communication opportunities. However, as in their regular studies they are usually not studying through a foreign/second language (except for sheltered courses), they do not need English as a tool in their immediate studies. \\"Content-based instruction (CBI) is the integration of selected content with language teaching aims\\".Brinton, D. M., Snow, M. A., & Wesche, M. B. (1989). Content- based second language instruction. New York: Newbury House.

It is the largest Catholic school in Manitoba with an enrollment of nearly seven hundred students from Kindergarten to Grade 12. History St. Maurice was founded in 1958 by Maurice Cournoyer and the Sisters of Sion, and was officially opened on September 28, 1958. However, due to declining student population, the school was closed in June 1970. St. Maurice School was reopened and incorporated on September 4, 1979 with the support of St. Vital Roman Catholic Church. In September 1980, two additional classrooms were added and in the spring of that year a gymnasium and a parish hall were completed. Grades seven and eight were added in September 1983 and two additional rooms were needed. Archbishop Adam Exner blessed the two new classrooms on December 11, 1983. On June 24, 1984 St. Maurice School paid tribute to its first Grade 8 graduating class. The High School wing was added on in 1987 and St. Maurice School opened its doors as the only Kindergarten to Grade 12 Catholic School in the Province of Manitoba. A new Parish Administration Centre and Rectory was built in 1990. This facility physically and philosophically provided a connection between St. Maurice School and St. Vital Parish Church, which now existed physically ‚Äúunder one roof‚Äù. Due to an ever-increasing enrollment at the school, a new wing of six classrooms was built in 1999 and now houses the Grade 4 to 6 classes. The St. Maurice Daycare and the Before and After School Program opened in May 2002. Many new facilities were constructed during 2004‚Äì2005 school year. The three kindergarten classrooms were relocated to the second floor of 1619 Pembina Highway, just across Manahan Avenue - from the main school and parish building. The library was moved to a central location in the elementary area of the school. The lower level below the gym was re- developed into a full service cafeteria and music/band room. The official opening and blessing by Father Morand took place on April 28 th, 2005. After 30 years of service as the Director of St. Maurice School, Monsignor Patrick Morand retired in 2009. Father Barry Schoonbaert became Pastor of St. Vital Parish and Director of St. Maurice School on July 1, 2009. He was replaced by Fr. Mark Tarrant at the end of the 2016‚Äì2017 school year. Today, with an enrollment of nearly seven hundred students, St. Maurice School is the largest Catholic School in Manitoba. The latest renovation was done to the old library area.

This obvious evolutionary success can probably be attributed to several factors.

Rainer Fetting was one of the co-founders and main protagonists of the Galerie am Moritzplatz in Berlin, founded in the late 1970s by a group of young artists (mainly painters) from the class of Karl Horst H√∂dicke at the former Berliner Hochschule f√ºr Bildende K√ºnste (Berlin Art Academy, today known as Universit√§t der K√ºnste). This group of artists, known as the ‚ÄúMoritzboys‚Äù and including, among others, Salom√©, Bernd Zimmer, and Helmut Middendorf, subsequently achieved international acclaim as the ‚ÄúJunge Wilde‚Äù or ‚ÄúNeue Wilde‚Äù in the early 1980s. Fetting is now one of the internationally best known contemporary German artists, having created a large oeuvre of expressive figurative paintings covering many different kinds of subject-matter, as well as many bronze sculptures.  Biography Rainer Fetting Artist, born 1949 in Wilhelmshaven. * 1972 ‚Äì 1978 Studies painting at the Hochschule der K√ºnste (Academy of Fine Arts), Berlin, with Prof. Hans Jaenisch * 1977 Co-founder of the Galerie am Moritzplatz with Helmut Middendorf, Bernd Zimmer, Salom√©, Anne Jud and Berthold Schepers. * 1978 DAAD Scholarship for residence in New York * 1983 ‚Äì 1994 lives in New York and Berlin * 1996 Willy Brandt sculpture for Willy Brandt House, Berlin * 2005 Portrait sculpture of Henri Nannen for the Henri Nannen Press Award * 2006 7 sculptures of Helmut Schmidt * Fetting lives and works in Berlin and on the island of Sylt, both Germany.  Artistic development  After having been trained as a carpenter and a stage designer at the Landesb√ºhne Niedersachsen in Wilhelmshaven, Germany, Fetting moved to Berlin and enrolled at the Berliner Hochschule f√ºr Bildende K√ºnste, studying painting with Hans Jaenisch from 1972 through 1978. In his final year at the academy he, together with Anne Jud, Helmut Middendorf, Stefan Roloff, Berthold Schepers, Salom√© and Bernd Zimmer founded the Galerie am Moritzplatz as a self-help project, in order to be able to exhibit their colorful figurative paintings in an art scene still dominated by minimalism, conceptual art, as well as Berlin Realism. The artists exhibiting at the gallery basically formed the core of the art movement that came to be known and rapidly achieved international acclaim as the ‚ÄûNeue Wilde‚Äú (or ‚ÄûJunge Wilde‚Äú). Fetting at the time focused on Berlin cityscapes, portraits and figurative work (e.g.\\"Van Gogh At The Wall\\"), painted in strong colors, and including many depictions of the Berlin Wall. In 1980 he participated in the exhibition Heftige Malerei‚Äú in the Haus am Waldsee, Berlin, in 1981 he was part of the exhibition New Spirit in Painting organized by Christos M. Joachimides and Norman Rosenthal at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, and in 1982 he participated in the exhibition ‚ÄúZeitgeist‚Äù in the Martin-Gropius-Bau, Berlin. After that he had many solo exhibitions in reputable galleries both in Europe and in the United States, such as Bruno Bischofberger, Mary Boone, Yvon Lambert, Daniel Templon, the Marlborough Gallery, New York, or Anthony d'Offay. In early 1983, the Mus√©e d'Art Contemporain de Bordeaux presented an exhibition of collaborative works by Luciano Castelli, Fetting, and Salom√©. The three artists also performed the concert ¬ªOp√©ra par hasard¬´ in Bordeaux and Paris (Fetting on drums). ).FETTING (Dumont Verlag 2009), p.172 In 1984 he participated in the exhibitions Von hier aus ‚Äì Zwei Monate neue deutsche Kunst in D√ºsseldorf and An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture at the MoMA, New York, in 1988 he was part of the exhibition Refigured Painting ‚Äì The German Image 1960‚Äì1988 at the Guggenheim Museum, New York. Between 1983 and 1994, Fetting spent part of his time in New York City, where he had already spent a year in 1978 on a grant from the DAAD. In his paintings, Fetting continued to explore the topic of the cityscape. Starting in 1984, while in New York, he experimented with assemblages of drift wood mounted on canvas and painted over. Paintings by Fetting were used as the works of Willem Dafoe's character in the 1985 film To Live and Die in L.A., in which Fetting had a cameo as a priest. In 1986, he also started doing bronze sculptures. His best known work is the 3,40-meters- high sculpture of former West German chancellor Willy Brandt, placed in the foyer of the SPD party headquarters in Berlin, Germany. In 2003/04 he was included in the exhibition Obsessive Malerei - Ein R√ºckblick auf die Neuen Wilden. Recent highlights were the solo shows ‚ÄúReturn of the Giants. Rainer Fetting Sculptures‚Äù (2008) and \\"Mancapes\\" (2010) at Gerhard-Marcks-Haus in Bremen and at Kunsthalle T√ºbingen. In 2011 the museum Berlinische Galerie honored the artist Rainer Fetting with an extensive solo exhibition.

Etymology The subspecific name, bauri, is in honor of herpetologist Georg Baur. Geographic range Of the four subspecies of the common box turtle, the Florida box turtle has the southernmost range. It is endemic to the U.S. state of Florida and the extreme southeastern portion of Georgia. Its distribution is widespread throughout Florida's mainland and has also been observed in the Florida Keys and the barrier islands in the Gulf of Mexico off of Florida's western coast. Habitat The Florida box turtle can be found in damp environments such as wetlands, marshlands, and near swamps but usually does not enter water deep enough to swim. It is often found in the flatwoods, upland, and mesophytic hammock but is generally absent in the high pine. Within these habitats, juveniles prefer areas that contain dense cover, high amounts of leaf litter, and moist soil. Adults are more flexible in their habitat requirements and have been observed in more open areas. =Temperature= *Daytime air temperature: 70 - 90 ¬∞F (21 - 32 ¬∞C) *Basking temperature: 85 - 95 ¬∞F (29 - 35 ¬∞C) *Humidity: 70 - 90% Description Florida box turtle (Terrapene carolina bauri) Like other box turtles, the Florida box turtle has a narrow and highly domed shell with a hinged plastron that allows it to close its shell tightly. However, the Florida box turtle is different in appearance from the other subspecies of Terrapene carolina. Its carapace has a distinct pattern of yellow stripes that make it easily identifiable. The coloring of the plastron can vary anywhere from solid yellow to solid black, with any number of variations in between. This turtle has very sharp claws as well as a sharp beak used for catching small insects and eating fruits, vegetables, and fungi. The Florida box turtle exhibits significant sexual dimorphism. On average, males are larger (length and width) than females. The carapace length of females ranges from 12.1 - 15.8 cm while the average male carapace can be anywhere from 12.8 - 17.3 cm long. However, female carapaces tend to be taller than those of males. This is most likely to allow more space to accommodate eggs inside the body cavity. __ Behavior  Box turtle in southeast Georgia Like many other box turtle species, the Florida box turtle spends an extreme majority of its life (80-90%) buried in the underbrush or underground, and their activity varies significantly at different times of the year. During the dry, cool parts of the year (November - February) they enter a dormant stage and are inactive and difficult to find. They exhibit higher levels of activity during the warm, wet months (April - October). However, unlike other species of box turtle, the Florida box turtle does not actually enter a complete state of hibernation during this time of year. This is most likely due to the warm and stable temperatures throughout its Florida range. As a result, it exhibits longer annual activity than other box turtle species. It is less tolerant to colder conditions than other common box turtle subspecies. = Feeding = The Florida box turtle is a generalist omnivore and has a diet very similar to other box turtle subspecies. Its most common food sources include gastropod species and fleshy, low-hanging fruits. They also consume leafy vegetation (shrubs, herb, grasses, etc.), insects, crustaceans, and fungi. They have even been observed feeding on carrion and garbage. = Seed dispersal = The Florida box turtle contributes to the seed dispersal of various plants throughout its range. The vast majority of these plants contain fruit (Annona glabra, Brysonima lucida, Coccoloba uvifera, Cocothrinax argentata, Ficus sp., Morinda royoc, Manilkara zapoda, Psidium longipes, Serenoa repens, Smilax havenensis, Thrinax morrissii) while others may not (Paspalum spp., Fabaceae).  Reproduction and life cycle  T. c. bauri hatchling The Florida box turtle reaches sexual maturity around 12‚Äì13 years of age. While some species are only able to produce one clutch in a breeding season, the Florida box turtle has been observed laying as many as four separate clutches in a single year. The egg laying season occurs in the Spring and generally lasts from April to very early June. On average, each clutch will contain anywhere from 1 - 9 eggs that range in size from 35 x 19 mm to 38.5 x 21 mm. Its eggs tend to be slightly larger than those of other T. carolina subspecies. Researchers have observed a positive relationship between female carapace length and clutch size, with larger females possessing the ability to produce more eggs. Incubation of the eggs lasts an average of 60 days but can last anywhere from 45 ‚Äì 120 days. Different environmental factors may influence the reproductive success of the Florida box turtle. Years with higher levels of precipitation may positively influence reproductive success, resulting in a higher number of hatchlings when compared with drier years. Research also points toward a positive correlation between latitude and clutch size in box turtles, with larger clutch sizes being found in higher latitudes. The incubation temperature of a clutch has been observed to influence the sex ratio of the hatchlings. Warm incubation temperatures tend to produce more females, while cooler temperatures result in more males. Its growth patterns are similar to other species of box turtles. Juvenile turtles have shorter and wider scutes and carapaces when compared to adults, but these lengthen as the individual grows. Growth rates are rapid in juveniles, slow down significantly following sexual maturity, and eventually level off completely a few years later (around 16 and 17 years in females and males respectively). Despite having higher activity levels, the Florida box turtle has a slower annual growth rate than other box turtle species.  Threats and conservation  Like other subspecies of T. carolina, the Florida box turtles is listed on the IUCN red list as a vulnerable species. Wild populations are at risk due to predation of eggs and juveniles (raccoons, possums, foxes, birds), habitat loss and modification, car strikes, pesticides, pollution, and collection for the pet trade and turtle racing. = Wildfires = Seasonal fire regimes in Florida represent a significant source of mortality for box turtles, with burns having the potential to kill off nearly half of a population. However, the mortality rate of turtles is lower during dry season burns as opposed to wet season burns. This is potentially due to its inactivity and its tendency to spend more time underground during the dry season. As pets Florida box turtles can be kept as pets. They are omnivores and feed on a huge variety of food in the wild. In captivity, they are especially fond of live food such as earthworms, crickets, locusts, snails, wax worms (as a treat because of their high fat content), superworms (Zophobas morio), and baby mice. In addition to this large variety of live foods, you can offer chopped fruits and vegetables. Finely grated dark green veggies such as lettuces and kale, and fruits such as melons, berries and cantaloupe are also accepted (though not eagerly) once or twice a week. By law, in their home state, no person may possess more than two of these turtles. People may be prosecuted by fine and removal of the animals if they own three or more without a reptile permit.http://www.calusaherp.org/business/laws.htm Legality of Box Turtles in Florida This subspecies can only be found in Florida, and is also protected in many other areas. Many pet stores offer hatchlings as pets, which are usually healthier than the box turtles from the wild. ReferencesExternal links * Further reading *Powell R, Conant R, Collins JT (2016).

The fortress exemplifies Abbasid architecture in Iraq by demonstrating the \\"despotic and the pleasure-loving character of the dynasty\\" in its grand size but cramped living quarters.Hillenbrand (1999). Marcel-Auguste Dieulafoy and Louis Massignon believed that the fortress used to be a pre-Islamic winter palace, built by an Iranian architect for the prince of Al-Hira. Therefore, it could be the renowned Qasr al-Sadir.

In 1996, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery, with the following citation: \\"One of the pioneers of parallel algorithms research, Dr. Vishkin's seminal contributions played a leading role in forming and shaping what thinking in parallel has come to mean in the fundamental theory of Computer Science.\\"ACM: Fellows Award / Uzi Vishkin. Biography Uzi Vishkin was born in Tel Aviv, Israel. He completed his B.Sc. (1974) and M.Sc. in Mathematics at the Hebrew University, before earning his D.Sc. in Computer Science at the Technion (1981). He then spent a year working at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. From 1982 to 1984, he worked at the department of computer science at New York University and remained affiliated with it till 1988. From 1984 until 1997 he worked in the computer science department of Tel Aviv University, serving as its chair from 1987 to 1988. Since 1988 he is with the University of Maryland, College Park. PRAM-on-chip A notable rudimentary abstraction‚Äîthat any single instruction available for execution in a serial program executes immediately‚Äîmade serial computing simple. A consequence of this abstraction is a step-by-step (inductive) explication of the instruction available next for execution. The rudimentary parallel abstraction behind the PRAM-on-chip concept, dubbed Immediate Concurrent Execution (ICE) in , is that indefinitely many instructions available for concurrent execution execute immediately. A consequence of ICE is a step-by-step (inductive) explication (also known as lock-step) of the instructions available next for concurrent execution. Moving beyond the serial von Neumann computer (the only successful general purpose platform to date), the aspiration of the PRAM-on-chip concept is that computer science will again be able to augment mathematical induction with a simple one-line computing abstraction. A chronological overview of the evolution of the PRAM-on-chip concept and its hardware and software prototyping follow. In the 1980s and 1990s, Uzi Vishkin co-authored several articles that helped building a theory of parallel algorithms in a mathematical model called parallel random access machine (PRAM), which is a generalization for parallel computing of the standard serial computing model random-access machine (RAM). The parallel machines needed for implementing the PRAM model have not yet been built at the time, and quite a few challenged the ability to ever build such machines. Concluding in 1997Vishkin, Uzi.

See also . that the transistor count on chip as implied by Moore's Law will allow building a powerful parallel computer on a single silicon chip within a decade, he developed a PRAM-On-Chip vision that called for building a parallel computer on a single chip that allows programmers to develop their algorithms for the PRAM model. He went on to invent the explicit multi-threaded (XMT) computer architecture that enables implementation of this PRAM theory, and led his research team to completing in January 2007 a 64-processor computerUniversity of Maryland, press release, June 26, 2007: \\"Maryland Professor Creates Desktop Supercomputer\\". named Paraleap,University of Maryland, A. James Clark School of Engineering, press release, November 28, 2007: \\"Next Big \\"Leap\\" in Computing Technology Gets a Name\\". that demonstrates the overall concept. The XMT concept was presented in , , the XMT 64-processor computer in , in and most recently in , where it was shown that lock-step parallel programming (using ICE) can achieve the same performance as the fastest hand-tuned multi-threaded code on XMT systems. Such inductive lock- step approach stands in contrast to multi-threaded programming approaches of other many core systems that are known for challenging programmers. The demonstration of XMT comprised several hardware and software components, as well as teaching PRAM algorithms in order to program the XMT Paraleap, using a language called XMTC. Since making parallel programming easy is one of the biggest challenges facing computer science today, the demonstration also sought to include teaching the basics of PRAM algorithms and XMTC programming to students ranging from high-school to graduate school. Parallel algorithms In the field of parallel algorithms, Uzi Vishkin co-authored the paper that contributed the work-time (WT) (sometimes called work-depth) framework for conceptualizing and describing parallel algorithms. The WT framework was adopted as the basic presentation framework in the parallel algorithms books and , as well as in the class notes . In the WT framework, a parallel algorithm is first described in terms of parallel rounds. For each round, the operations to be performed are characterized, but several issues can be suppressed. For example, the number of operations at each round need not be clear, processors need not be mentioned and any information that may help with the assignment of processors to jobs need not be accounted for. Second, the suppressed information is provided. The inclusion of the suppressed information is, in fact, guided by the proof of a scheduling theorem due to . The WT framework is useful since while it can greatly simplify the initial description of a parallel algorithm, inserting the details suppressed by that initial description is often not very difficult. Similarly, first casting an algorithm in the WT framework can be very helpful for programming it in XMTC. explains the simple connection between the WT framework and the more rudimentary ICE abstraction noted above. In the field of parallel and distributed algorithms, one of the seminal papers co-authored by Uzi Vishkin is . This work introduced an efficient parallel technique for graph coloring. The Cole‚ÄìVishkin algorithm finds a vertex colouring in an n-cycle in O(log* n) synchronous communication rounds. This algorithm is nowadays presented in many textbooks, including Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al.,1st ed., Section 30.5. and it forms the basis of many other distributed algorithms for graph colouring.See, e.g., . Other contributions by Uzi Vishkin and various co-authors include parallel algorithms for list ranking, lowest common ancestor, spanning trees, and biconnected components.

The metropolitan area comprises approximately one third of the area of Lower Saxony, with almost half the inhabitants of the state. It has about 3.9 million people in 20 districts and counties with a total of 431 municipalities and is defined by the German Ministerkonferenz f√ºr Raumordnung (MKRO) as a medium urban area in Germany. History The application for recognition as a European metropolitan region with the German Ministerkonferenz f√ºr Raumordnung responsible for regional planning (MKRO) was made early. The recognition should help the region internationally and improve coordination and development of cities. Although the importance of the region and the developments relating to the citynetwork Expo 2000 she was still the smallest of the metropolitan regions. In 2005 a loose co-operation was initiated with the nearby city regions of Braunschweig and Salzgitter and up in the area of G√∂ttingen. Area description Between the cities of the region there are large predominantly agricultural areas. The urban infrastructure network consist of the highways A2, A7 and A39 and fast rail links, in particular some high speed rail (like the Hanover‚ÄìW√ºrzburg high-speed railway). The region is mainly based on the service sector and manufacturing. The largest group is the Volkswagen AG headquarters in Wolfsburg. The science and research landscape of the region includes seven universities (including the University of G√∂ttingen, Leibniz University Hannover and the Braunschweig University of Technology), nine colleges, an art college, a music and theater school, and approximately 60 other research institutions (including a large number of Max Planck Society Institutes, two locations of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) in Braunschweig and G√∂ttingen, the Herzog August Bibliothek in Wolfenb√ºttel and various federal agencies such as BBA, BGR, FAL, PTB).

History SHOUTAmerica was founded in 2008, with the support of R. Clayton McWhorter, a well-known, veteran healthcare executive and former chairman of Hospital Corporation of America. McWhorter's longtime role as a leader in the healthcare industry has fostered his ability to foresee a system destined for change. The idea that would eventually become SHOUTAmerica grew from McWhorter's deep concern for the impact of healthcare's rising cost on future generations, as well as his belief in the necessity of empowering young Americans in the issues that shape this nation both today and especially tomorrow. Thus, in continuing his long legacy of giving back, McWhorter lent his vision, resources and a blank whiteboard to a handful of young individuals, tasked with creating an organization that would educate and energize the future of America on the need for healthcare reform. The organization formally launched in October 2008, with the SHOUTAmerica Healthcare Leadership Conference. The conference brought together student government leaders from colleges and universities around the nation to Nashville, Tennessee to discuss healthcare and its impact on the nation. Student leaders interacted with a host of healthcare leaders including Senator Bob Corker, a co-sponsor of \\"The Healthy Americans Act\\"; U.S. Representative Jim Cooper, a Rhodes Scholar and Congressman from Tennessee; Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a special advisor to the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget for health policy and a former member of President Clinton's Health Care Task Force and author of Healthcare Guaranteed; and Stephanie Kennan, a healthcare policy expert and author of \\"The Healthy Americans Act.\\" Participants also helped develop implementation plans to take the SHOUTAmerica cause back to their respective campuses. Highlighting the call to action was a viewing of the original Declaration of Independence, followed by the signing of SHOUTAmerica's \\"Declaration of Commitment\\" to the pursuit of healthcare reform., Focus Area SHOUTAmerica contends that there is a healthcare crisis in the United States emerging largely from healthcare's rapidly rising cost, which at current stands to bankrupt the federal government, weaken the American economy and leave an increasing number of Americans uninsured. * As a country and as individuals we pay the most for our healthcare in the world, but our system ranks 37th in quality according to the World Health Organization and leaves 1 out of every 6 Americans uninsured. * In 2007, the average cost for family insurance coverage was $12,106 per year. * General Motors now spends more on healthcare than on steel, while Starbucks spends more on healthcare than on coffee beans. * Our government has current unfunded, financial obligations of approximately $34.1 trillion from Medicare. Activities SHOUTAmerica primarily directs its efforts at spreading awareness and generating dialogue amongst Americans about how the future is being threatened by a broken and unsustainable healthcare system and what they can do to help. The organization offers education materials on its website regarding the healthcare crisis as well as tools and resources aimed at helping individuals develop and share their thoughts about healthcare reform in America with the online community and healthcare experts. SHOUTAmerica is actively seeking partners to help educate and to provide resources for its community. In October 2008, SHOUTAmerica partnered with change:healthcare, a company focused on driving transparency throughout the healthcare industry. As a leader in consumerism and technology, change:healthcare's interactive platform provides an online tool to track, share and compare healthcare costs and experiences. This partnership led to the development of the SHOUTAmerica healthcare cost manager, a customized way for the SHOUTAmerica community to evaluate and compare their own healthcare expenditures.

The first war began in 1603 and ended with a Safavid victory in 1612, when Persia regained and reestablished its suzerainty over the Caucasus and Western Iran, which had been lost at the Treaty of Constantinople in 1590. The second war began in 1615 and ended in 1618 with minor territorial adjustments.  Course  Safavid attack and early successes (1603‚Äì1604) = capture of Tabriz and the parading before Shah Abbas I of the severed heads of Ottoman soldiers. Drawn by a European traveller, 1603. As a result of the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid War (1578‚Äì1590) the Ottomans had gained swaths of the Safavid territories in the northwest and west, including Shirvan, Dagestan, most of Azerbaijan, Kartli, Kakheti, Luristan and Khuzestan. Abbas I had recently undertaken a major reform of the Safavid army through the English gentleman of fortune Robert Shirley and the shah's favorite ghulam and chancellor Allahverdi Khan. When Abbas I decided to attack on Ottomans to recover the large territories lost in the previous war, the Ottomans were engaged heavily in the European front due to the Long Turkish War started in 1593. Furthermore, the Ottomans were troubled in Eastern Anatolia because of the Jelali revolts, the Karayazƒ±cƒ± rebellion (1598‚Äì1602) being the most destructive one.Griswold, William J. The Great Anatolian Rebellion, 1000‚Äì1020/1591‚Äì1611 (Islamkundliche Untersuchungen), 1983. K. Schwarz Verlag. Constantinople, the capital of the Ottoman Empire was also in turmoil in the beginning of 1603 as the tension between the Janissaries and the Sipahis were only to be eased temporarily with the intervention of the Palace. Thus, the Safavid attack on 26 September 1603 caught the Ottomans unprepared and forced them to fight in two distant fronts. Abbas I first recaptured Nahavand and destroyed the fortress in the city, which the Ottomans had planned to use as an advance base for attacks on Iran. The Safavid army was able to capture Tabriz on 21 October 1603. For the first time, the Iranians made great use of their artillery and the town ‚Äì which had been ruined by Ottoman occupation ‚Äì soon fell. Local citizens welcomed the Safavid army as liberators and took harsh reprisals against the defeated Ottoman Turks who had been occupying their city. Many unfortunate Turks fell into the hands of Tabriz‚Äôs citizens and were decapitated. The Safavids entered Nakhchivan at the same month soon after the city was evacuated by the Ottomans. The Safavid army then laid siege to Yerevan on 15 November 1603. Safavid armies captured Tbilisi and both Kartli and Kakheti became Safavid dependencies once again. French traveller Jean Chardin, 17th century = Unsuccessful Ottoman counter-attack (1604‚Äì1605) = Thomas Herbert in 1627. While facing disasters at the Eastern front, Mehmed III died on 20 December 1603 at the age of 37. The new sultan Ahmed I who was 13 years old appointed Cigalazade Yusuf Sinan Pasha as the commander of the eastern army who marched from Istanbul 15 June 1604, a very late time for the campaigning season. Until he reached the front on 8 November 1604, the Safavid army had already captured Yerevan in June and advanced towards Kars before being stopped in Akhaltsikhe. Seeing the late season as an excuse, he did not counter-attack Abbas I and decided to stay in Van until the end of the winter. However, the Safavid advance forced him to march towards Erzurum. The inactivity created unrest among the Turkish ranks. His campaign of 1605 was unsuccessful, the forces he led towards Tabriz suffering defeat near the shore of Lake Urmia on 9 September 1605. This was the first Safavid pitched victory against the Ottomans in their history. In this battle Abbas I utilized his predominantly cavalry force to great advantage, decisively defeating the Ottomans, who suffered some 20,000 dead. Kose Sefer Pasha, Beylerbey of Erzurum, acted independently and was captured by Safavid forces. Caƒüaloƒülu had to withdraw to the fortress of Van and thence in the direction of Diyarbakƒ±r. He ordered the execution of Canbulatoƒülu H√ºseyin Pasha claiming he was late to reinforce the Ottoman army which caused a larger unrest. Sinan died in the course of this retreat in December 1605 and Abbas I was able to liberate Ganja, Baku, Shirvan and Shamakhi in Azerbaijan in June 1606. = The Ottomans focus on western and internal fronts (1605‚Äì1609) = The Ottomans focused on the western front and the successful campaign of 1605 against the Holy Roman Empire under the command of Grand Vizier Sokolluzade Lala Mehmed Pasha ameliorated the situation in Hungary, which paved the way to the Peace of Zsitvatorok in 1606. Ahmed I appointed Lala Mehmed Pasha as the commander of the eastern front who died suddenly on 25 June 1606. The absence of an effective Ottoman army created a power vacuum in the Empire\`s eastern fronts. Thus, Jelali revolts reached its zenith as Tavil Ahmed captured Harput and his son Mehmed overthrew the Ottoman authority in Baghdad and defeated the Ottoman force under Nasuh Pasha who was sent to restore the order in Iraq. Baghdad was cleared of rebels only in 1607 while Fakhr-al-Din II extended his authority in Lebanon and western Syria with the alliance of another rebel Canbulatoƒülu Ali Pasha who challenged Sultan\`s authority in Adana. With the advantage of peace in western front the Ottoman Empire gave its priority to the eastern front. The army under the command of Grand Vizier Kuyucu Murad Pasha decided to crush the rebellions first to secure the back of the army against the Safavids. Tens of thousands of Anatolians were killed during Murad Pasha's office in his campaigns (1607‚Äì1609) against separate large rebel groups. = The renewed Ottoman counter-attack and peace (1610‚Äì1612) = When the order was restored, Murad Pasha marched against Abbas I who was in Tabriz in 1610. Although the two armies met in Acƒ±√ßay, north of Tabriz, no engagement or action took place. Due to the problems in the logistics, supply chain and the approaching winter Murad Pasha withdrew his forces to Diyarbakƒ±r. While being engaged in diplomatic correspondence with Abbas I for peace and preparing his army for another campaign at the same time he died on 5 August 1611 when he was older than 90. Nasuh Pasha was appointed as the new grand vizier and the commander of the eastern armies. He sued for peace, too, and accepted the proposal of the Safevid side in 1611. The Treaty of Nasuh Pasha was signed on 20 November 1612. The agreement secured the 1555 borders envisaged by the Peace of Amasya. Shah Abbas however, committed himself to send 200 bales of raw silk annually. = The vulnerable peace (1612‚Äì1615) = In practice the Treaty of Nasuh Pasha was little more than a truce, as the Ottomans remained determined to reverse the Safavid conquests, and it was not long before war broke out again. Between 1612 and 1615 Abbas I refused to send the silks he promised and this created another pretext for the renewal of hostilities. The Safavid army was able to restore the suzerainty on the eastern Georgian princedoms. = War breaks out again (1615‚Äì1618) = The interior of the Yerevan Castle The Ottomans decided to go on war again in 1615. Grand Vizier √ñk√ºz Mehmed Pasha was appointed as the commander who postponed the envisaged campaign to 1616. This inaction gave the Safavids sufficient time to reinforce the border strongholds. The Safavid emissary to Istanbul returned to Iran with empty hands. In April 1616, √ñk√ºz Mehmed Pasha marched from Aleppo towards Kars, reinforced the castle and sent two forces to Yerevan and Nihavand which was taken by the Safavids in 1603 soon after the fall of Tabriz. Soon afterwards, he led his armies to Yerevan, defeated a small Safavid force and laid siege to the city. The Ottomans lacked adequate siege weapons and the defenders fought well. The Ottomans suffered major casualties from both the cold and the Safavid forces. √ñk√ºz Mehmed Pasha lifted the unsuccessful siege and withdrew to Erzurum. Due to his failure, he was dismissed and was replaced by Damat Halil Pasha on 17 November 1616 who was sent to lead the armies in the eastern front. When Damat Halil Pasha proceeded to the front the Crimean forces looted Ganja, Nakhchivan and Julfa. However, the year 1617 passed without any significant engagement. Back in Istanbul, the Ottoman throne saw consequent changes. Ahmed I died on 22 November 1617 when he was 27 years old. Ahmed I\`s early death created a dilemma never before experienced by the Ottoman Empire. Multiple princes were now eligible for the Sultanate, and all of them lived in Topkapƒ± Palace. A court faction headed by the ≈ûeyh√ºlislam Esad Efendi and Sofu Mehmed Pasha (who represented the Grand Vizier when he was away from Istanbul) decided to enthrone Mustafa instead of Ahmed's son Osman. It was the first time an Ottoman Sultan was succeeded by his brother instead of his son. It was hoped that regular social contact would improve Mustafa's mental health, but his behavior remained eccentric. In 1618, after a short rule, another palace faction deposed him in favour of his young nephew Osman II. A 16th-century map of Tabriz, sketched by Matrak√ßƒ± Nasuh (Ottoman polymath). Osman II designated √ñk√ºz Mehmed Pasha once again for the eastern front. Abbas learnt the Ottoman plan was to invade via Azerbaijan, take Tabriz then move on to Ardabil and Qazvin, which they could use as bargaining chips to exchange for other territories. The shah decided to lay a trap. He would allow the Ottomans to enter the country, then destroy them. He had Tabriz evacuated of its inhabitants while he waited at Ardabil with his army. In 1618, an Ottoman army of 100,000 led by the grand vizier, invaded and easily seized Tabriz. The vizier sent an ambassador to the shah demanding he make peace and return the lands taken since 1603. Abbas refused and pretended he was ready to set fire to Ardabil and retreat further inland rather than face the Ottoman army. When the vizier heard the news, he decided to march on Ardabil right away. This was just what Abbas wanted. His army of 40,000 commanded by Qarachaqay Khan was hiding at a crossroads on the way and they ambushed the Ottoman army in the battle of Sufiyan on 10 September 1618, which ended in complete victory for the Iranians. The beylerbeys of Rumelia, Diyarbakƒ±r and Van were among thousands who lost their lives. The new Grand Vizier Damat Halil Pasha took command, continued the invasion. When the Ottoman army started to threaten Ardabil the Safavids sued for peace. The terms of the treaty was similar to those of treaty of Nasuh Pasha with several minor rectifications of the border line. Also, the annual tribute of the Persian side was reduced from 200 loads to 100 loads of silk.

It is one of the most important Czech Gothic buildings built in the time of the very last P≈ôemyslids and also a very important and one of the oldest examples of the Baroque Gothic style (connected with the Czech Baroque architect Jan Bla≈æej Santini-Aichel).  History  The church was built first in the Gothic style around 1300 as one of the first High Gothic buildings in the Kingdom of Bohemia and as the first church in the kingdom resembling French Gothic cathedrals. It was built on the place of an older church and was a part of the Cistercians Sedlec Abbey, which was the oldest Cistercian abbey in the Czech lands founded in 1142. The abbey was burnt down by the Hussites in 1421 and the church became a ruin for the next two centuries. In 1700 the abbot of the Sedlec Abbey Jind≈ôich Snopek decided to rebuild the old church. The reconstruction was conducted by the architect Pavel Ign√°c Bayer. After three years Bayer was replaced by Jan Bla≈æej Santini-Aichel who had worked for the Cistercians already in Zbraslav. He completed the reconstruction of the church in his original style called Baroque Gothic. This reconstruction was celebrated for its impressive vaulting and facade as well as for its antechamber, which had been decorated by the statues made by Matƒõj V√°clav J√§ckel. The church was consecrated in 1708. Although the church was rebuilt in the early 18th century his eastern part with side chapels, choir and transept should have preserved its original appearance (from outside). The latest restoration of the church took place in 2001.  Gallery  File:Kutna Hora-Sedlec cathedral 012.jpgSedlec Cathedral File:Kutna Hora Cathedral of Our Lady nave 2.jpgInterior of the church.

States Twelve out of Nigeria's thirty-six states have Islam as the dominant religion. In 1999, those states chose to have Sharia courts as well as Customary courts. As of 2012, the following 12 states have instituted Sharia: * Zamfara State (27 January 2000) * Kano State (21 June 2000) * Sokoto State * Katsina State * Bauchi State (June 2001) * Borno State * Jigawa State * Kebbi State * Yobe State * Kaduna State * Niger State (4 May 2000) * Gombe State Blasphemy  Blasphemy is a criminal offence in both the Nigerian civil law and shari'a law  Execution(s)  In 2002, the first execution of a man convicted under Sharia laws took place in Katsina State. The man was hanged after pleading guilty to murdering a woman and her two children Nigeria: First Execution under Sharia Condemned, Human Rights Watch, 8 January 2002  Homosexuality  Homosexuality is a criminal offence in both the civil and shari'a law. The two most common religions Islam and Christianity as well as the traditions of the people forbade homosexuality. In 2014, homosexual men were targeted by Hisbah, the religious police. In Nigeria, federal law criminalizes homosexual behaviour, but states with Sharia law impose stiffer punishments.  Sharia Court of Appeals  Recognized as a federal court of appeals under the government of Nigeria, the Sharia Court of Appeals is the most controversial of the judicial system. It exists within the Federal Capital Territory of Nigeria and is a part of the Unified Courts System. The Sharia Court of Appeals reviews cases involving Sharia law, particularly in the North and Northeast regions of the country. This has caused controversy because while the Sharia Court of Appeals interprets and reviews cases relating to Islamic law, they must also interpret the common and customary laws of the other regions of Nigeria. Controversy Some argue that as implemented in the north, Sharia violates the Constitution of Nigeria.In Nigeria, Many Girls Are Married And Divorced Before Adulthood.

Lawal's conviction provoked outrage both in southern Nigeria and the West, with many national and international NGOs lobbying the federal government to overturn her conviction.

The trail, opened in 2000, travels along the former route of the Weymouth and Portland Railway and is part of the South West Coast Path. The route follows part of the Jurassic Coast, and Sites of Special Scientific Interest. It is named after a neighbourhood of Weymouth which it passes through. The trail is estimated to be used by thousands of people, often as a means of avoiding traffic congestion in Weymouth. The trail is popular with pedestrians, cyclists and dog walkers. Maintenance of the trail is carried out by the Friends of Rodwell Trail group, who carry out litter picks and clear overgrowth on the route. Their work has been promoted by local publications such as the Dorset Echo. Route Rodwell Tunnel leading to Rodwell Halt World War II gun emplacement, now a viewing platform. The trail starts on Abbotsbury Road in Westham, Weymouth and ends at Ferrybridge in Wyke Regis. The latter part of the trail is along the northern side of Portland Harbour, passing the Tudor Sandsfoot Castle. The Rodwell Trail follows travels along the former route of the Weymouth and Portland Railway, which was constructed in 1865 to carry passengers and Portland Stone between the two settlements. In 1891 it would be extended to serve Whitehead's Torpedo Factory at Wyke Regis (within close proximity of where the trail ends). In 1870 the first intermediate station at Rodwell was opened and later improved in 1908, with a new passing loop, platform and signal box. The line's use was improved further in 1909 when new halts were added at Westham and Wyke Regis, and again in 1932 with a stop at Sandsfoot Castle Halt. The railway closed on 9 April 1965.https://www.dorsetforyou.com/media.jsp?mediaid=191812&filetype;=pdf Along the route, the remains of the station platforms, and other relics, including tunnels can be seen as a reminder of the railway. The signboards of each station halt are not original, but label each original stop. Within the Westham area of the trail, a World War II light anti-aircraft gun emplacement built into the railway embankment was refurbished in recent years to provide a viewing platform across Weymouth and to act as a reminder of Weymouth's defence during the war largely on account of the naval base at Portland. The stone structured emplacement would have given low-level defence to Weymouth and Portland harbours. The mounting gun ring still remains, and this would have held a 40 mm Bofors Gun. The dividing partitions surrounding the ring, still survive, which would have been ready-use ammunition lockers and general equipment storage cupboards, as does the rooms below that are reached by a set of steps on the southern side of the emplacement. An extension of the trail further along the old railway line was proposed as a means of access to the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy during the 2012 Olympic Games. Following a ¬£900,000 investment, ¬£350,000 of which was contributed by the Big Lottery funded Sustrans \\"Connect2\\" initiative in 2012, a missing link in the trail was reconnected and installed. The Rodwell Trail featured on the BBC factual programme Railway Walks, broadcast on BBC Four in October 2008, and repeated on BBC Two in April 2009. Portland's Merchant's Railway was also featured on the programme. Wildlife The trail is a haven for various wildlife, and forms a green lung linking Ferry Bridge with the RSPB Radipole Lake wildlife reserve. The route often features many species of birds, including Kingfishers, Redwings and Great Crested Grebes. A range of insects, rodents, mammals such as foxes and badgers, as well as lizards and frogs can also be seen. Plantlife includes Foxgloves, Bluebells and Meadow Buttercups. Abbotsbury Road often has Hedge Sparrows and Blackbirds in the hedges, along with Garden Spiders and Great Green Bush Crickets. Serotine Bats and Pipistrelle Bats have also been seen around this area. To the south of Wyke Tunnel, the damp environment has spawned Pendulous Sedge and Heart's Tongue ferns. Common frogs and Blackcaps are found within this area, as well as foxes and badgers. The Buxton Road Bridge region often has many species of a butterfly during the summer, including Red Admiral, Comma, and Holly Blue. Mice may also be spotted within the area. Between Sandsfoot and Wyke Halts, various wildlife from Common Lizards to the Common Blue butterfly are often found. Amongst the reeds are Wasp Spiders and the rare Bithyinian Vetch and Little Robin plants. At the Sandsfoot Gardens, the vantage spot over Portland Harbour is popular for seeing overwintering birds such as the Great Northern Diver, Slavonian Grebes, and Mergansers.

The extinct Iberian language is sometimes putatively included. The concept of the Vasconic languages is often linked to the Vasconic substratum hypothesis of Theo Vennemann, who speculated that the ancestors of the Basque spread across Europe at the end of the last glacial period when the Cro-Magnons entered Europe and left traces in the modern languages of Europe. Along with other hypotheses that seek to relate Basque to other languages of the world, this is widely rejected by historical linguists. Proponents of a Vasconic language family argue that Basque and the extinct Aquitanian language are close relatives, or that the modern varieties of Basque are distinct languages rather than dialects. However, these notions contradict conventional views on these languages, in two areas: #Theories regarding the relationship between Aquitanian and Basque, which suggest that either: #* Aquitanian is the ancestor of Basque, and as Larry Trask puts it: \\"Aquitanian is so closely related to Basque that we can, for practical purposes, regard it as being the more-or-less direct ancestor of Basque\\", #* or that a hypothetical Proto- Basque is the parent language of Aquitanian, #The view that varieties of Basque are dialects with varying degrees of mutual intelligibility.Pagola, RM Euskalkiz Euskalki Basque Government 1984 This view is held by scholars such as Trask, Koldo Zuazo, and Koldo Mitxelena. Trask states: \\"Nonetheless, the diversification should not be exaggerated, as has often been done in the literature: the dialects are overwhelmingly congruent in their fundamentals and differ chiefly in vocabulary and in a few low-level phonological rules.\\"Trask, L. The History of Basque, Routledge: 1997, Various attempts have been made to tie other languages, modern or extinct, such as Iberian, the language of the Nuraghe, and the language of the Cantabri and various others to Vasconic. None of these theories have been able to provide convincing data, and they are rejected by most mainstream Basque linguists. A reconstruction of a Proto-Vasconic language is almost impossible with currently available information. More data and research are needed to reconstruct the basics of a proto-language, as well as more information surrounding the neighboring extinct languages such as Iberian and the relationship it has with Vasconic. Reconstruction of a hypothesized Vasconic Proto-language could only be done using the comparative method, although the accuracy of the reconstructed proto-language would still be uncertain.

Slany is also thought of as one of the icons of design Who's Who in German Design in Germany. He founded TEAMS Design GmbH, was a Professor of Industrial Design (ID) for more than 20 years and helped found the Verband Deutscher Industrie Designer e. V.Verband Deutscher Industrie Designe e.V. in 1959 (VDID - Germany‚Äôs version of the Industrial Designers Society of America (IDSA)). He then helped the VDID with their entry into the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design (ICSID).ICSID Early years Slany was born in 1926 in B√∂hmisch Wiesenthal, Czechoslovakia. He served in the Wehrmacht and was POW in World War II. After the war, he graduated in 1948 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering from Hochschule Esslingen,Hochschule Esslingen, University of Applied Sciences University of Applied Sciences. Out of school he obtained a position as a product developer and assistant technical manager at Firma Ritter Aluminum GmbHFirma Ritter Aluminum GmbH Esslingen am Neckar. He then went on to the styling department at Daimler AG SindelfingenDaimler- Benz AG Sindelfingen in the Mercedes-Benz studio where he worked for 2 years. While at Daimler, he worked on the distinctive gull wing Mercedes-Benz 300SL. He also collaborated with Heinrich Loffelhardt on the Ikonette Compact Camera for Zeiss-Ikon. Slany Design In 1956 Hans Erich Slany founded his own design consultancy called SLANY Design. Soon after the founding, he approached Robert Bosch GmbH with his ideas for power tools housed in plastics. He was convinced that plastic housings would make the tools lighter, making the workers using them less prone to repetitive use injury. Also, it would reduce problems with electrical shocks. Robert Bosch GmbH even went on to publish a book called ‚ÄúThe Influence of Ergonomics on the Design of Power Tools‚Äù based on Slany‚Äôs recommendations to share with all their engineers and to follow up a traveling exhibition (Europe only) they sponsored called, ‚ÄúMaking work easier: Ergonomics for power tools‚Äù. He believed that the designer should be the advocate of the user of the equipment they are called upon to design. Slany was awarded an honorary doctorate by the Berlin University of the ArtsBerlin University of the Arts in 1985. He also founded the industrial design program at the State Academy of Fine Arts StuttgartStuttgart State Academy of Art and Design which was the first intensive ID program in Germany. Slany desired to infuse the company with a strong team based mentality. He said, \\"Fr√ºher arbeiteten Gestalter oft isoliert und mit k√ºnsterlischen Gestaltungskriterien, beeinflu√üt durch unterschiedliche kulturelle Anschauungsterndenzen.

The six other designers are Professor Arno Votteler, Hans-Theo Baumann,Han-Theo Baumann Biography on Ketterer KunstBaumann Biography on Art Director Design Herbert Hirche, (de)G√ºnter Kupetz, Rainer Sch√ºtze, and (de)Peter Raacke. They believed that designers needed an association to promote professional advocacy, support them in both legal and educational issues, and to represent the profession to the public. Around that same time they joined the ICSID as a full member. VDID also works closely with the German Fashion and Textile Design Association (VDMD)VDMD Site under the umbrella of the German Designer Association (DDV).DDV Site Later years ‚Äì TEAMS Design As Slany Design grew, Slany realized that the firm would have to evolve. He sold part of his shares in the company to two of his managers, Reinhard Renner and Klaus Schoen and changed the firm's name to Slany Design TEAMS. Finally when he retired in 1996, he was awarded the highest honor in Germany for lifetime service, the Bundesverdienstkreuz by then Federal President Roman Herzog. In accordance to Slany's ten-year plan, Renner and Schoen then removed Slany's name from the company name leaving simply TEAMS Design GmbH. A lot of Slany's founding philosophies are at the heart of the firm today, now expanding across 4 countries (Germany, Serbia, United States and China) with 5 offices in Esslingen, Hamburg, Belgrade, Chicago, and Shanghai. TEAMS Design continues to win awards and lead in the field of design while maintaining some of Slany‚Äôs original clients like Robert Bosch GmbH, Karcher GmbH, Silit,Silit Corporate Site and Leifheit.Leifheit Corporate Site Awards and distinctions 1973-78 Awarded ‚ÄúGute Form‚Äù awards also known as the German Design Award 1985 Honorary doctorate by the Berlin University of the Arts 1986 Became the Academic Director and a professor at the newly founded industrial design program for the Stuttgart State Academy of Art and Design.

Fear of God refers to fear or a specific sense of respect, awe, and submission to a deity. People subscribing to popular monotheistic religions might fear divine judgment, hell or God's omnipotence. Christianity In the New Testament, this fear is described using the Greek word œÜœåŒ≤ŒøœÇ (phobos, \\"fear/horror\\"), except in , where Paul describes Œ≥œÖŒΩŒ±ŒπŒæ·Ω∂ŒΩ ·ºêœÄŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒªŒøŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒ±ŒπœÇ Œ∏ŒµŒøœÉŒ≠Œ≤ŒµŒπŒ±ŒΩ (gynaixin epangellomenais theosebeian), \\"women professing the fear of God\\", using the word Œ∏ŒµŒøœÉŒ≠Œ≤ŒµŒπŒ± (theosebeia). The term can mean fear of God's judgment. However, from a theological perspective \\"fear of the Lord\\" encompasses more than simple fear. Robert B. Strimple says, \\"There is the convergence of awe, reverence, adoration, honor, worship, confidence, thankfulness, love, and, yes, fear.\\" In the Magnificat () Mary declaims, \\"His mercy is from age to age to those who fear him.\\" The Parable of the Unjust Judge () finds Jesus describing the judge as one who \\"...neither feared God nor cared for man.\\" Some translations of the Bible, such as the New International Version, sometimes replace the word \\"fear\\" with \\"reverence\\". According to Pope Francis, ‚ÄúThe fear of the Lord, the gift of the Holy Spirit, doesn‚Äôt mean being afraid of God, since we know that God is our Father that always loves and forgives us,...[It] is no servile fear, but rather a joyful awareness of God‚Äôs grandeur and a grateful realization that only in him do our hearts find true peace.‚ÄùHarris, Elise. \\"Pope: Fear of the Lord an alarm reminding us of what's right\\", Catholic News Agency, June 11, 2014 Roman Catholicism counts this fear as one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. In , the fear of the Lord is described as the \\"discipline\\" or \\"instruction\\" of wisdom.The New Revised Standard Version translates the Hebrew as instruction. Writing in the Catholic Encyclopedia, Jacques Forget explains that this gift \\"fills us with a sovereign respect for God, and makes us dread, above all things, to offend Him.\\"Forget, Jacques. \\"Holy Ghost.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 3 September 2016 In an April 2006 article published in Inside the Vatican magazine, contributing editor John Mallon writes that the \\"fear\\" in \\"fear of the Lord\\" is often misinterpreted as \\"servile fear\\" (the fear of getting in trouble) when it should be understood as \\"filial fear\\" (the fear of offending someone whom one loves). Lutheran theologian Rudolf Otto coined the term numinous to express the type of fear one has for God. Anglican lay theologian C. S. Lewis references the term in many of his writings, but specifically describes it in his book The Problem of Pain and states that fear of the numinous is not a fear that one feels for a tiger, or even a ghost. Rather, the fear of the numinous, as C. S. Lewis describes it, is one filled with awe, in which you \\"feel wonder and a certain shrinking\\" or \\"a sense of inadequacy to cope with such a visitant and our prostration before it\\". It is a fear that comes forth out of love for the Lord. Islam Taqwa is an Islamic term for being conscious and cognizant of God, of truth, of the rational reality, \\"piety, fear of God\\".\\"Ta·∏≥wƒÅ\\",Encyclopaedia of Islam (2012).Nanji, Azim. \\"Islamic Ethics,\\" in A Companion to Ethics, Peter Singer. Oxford: Blackwells, n(1991), pp. 106-118. It is often found in the Quran. Al-Muttaqin ( ') refers to those who practice taqwa, or in the words of Ibn Abbas -- \\"believers who avoid Shirk with Allah and who work in His obedience.\\" Judaism The first mention of the fear of God in the Hebrew Bible is in , where Abraham is commended for putting his trust in God. In , the prophet describes the shoot that shall sprout from the stump of Jesse, \\"The spirit of the Lord shall rest upon him: a spirit of wisdom and of understanding, A spirit of counsel and of strength, a spirit of knowledge and of fear of the Lord, and his delight shall be the fear of the Lord.\\" says that \\"fear of the Lord\\" is \\"the beginning of wisdom\\".The New Jewish Publication Society of America Version translates the Hebrew as discipline. The Hebrew words ◊ô÷¥◊®÷∞◊ê÷∑÷£◊™ (yir‚Äôa·πØ) and ◊§◊ó◊ì (pÃÑa·∏•a·∏è) are most commonly used to describe fear of God/El/Yahweh. Bahya ibn Paquda characterized two types of fear as a lower \\"fear of punishment\\" and a higher \\"fear of [divine awe] glory.\\" Abraham ibn Daud differentiated between \\"fear of harm\\" (analogous to fear of a snake bite or a king's punishment) and \\"fear of greatness,\\" analogous to respect for an exalted person, who would do us no harm. Maimonides categorized the fear of God as a positive commandment, as the feeling of human insignificance deriving from contemplation of God's \\"great and wonderful actions and creations.\\" Office of the Chief Rabbi Bah√°'√≠ In the Bah√°'√≠ Faith, \\"The heart must be sanctified from every form of selfishness and lust, for the weapons of the unitarians and the saints were and are the fear of God.\\"\\"Fear of God\\", Bah√°'√≠ Library Online Alternate views Author Boyd C.

Background Prior to Allenby's appointment as commander of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, the German and Ottoman air services had enjoyed air superiority in the Levant. This was because of the superior quantity and quality of German Rumpler and Fokker aircraft in comparison to the British aircraft. Allenby was an air power enthusiast and he requested that the British War Office increase the number and quality of Flying Corps aircraft at his disposal. Formation and composition With an increased number of British aircraft in the Middle East, the Palestine Brigade was formed on 5 October 1917. It consisted of all Royal Flying Corps operational units based in the Middle East which were east of Suez. Forming part of Royal Flying Corps Middle East and it was initially commanded by Brigadier-General W G H Salmond who retained command of RFC Middle East. In December 1917, command of the Palestine Brigade ceased to be held by the commander of RFC Middle East. Brigadier-General A E Borton was appointed Brigade Commander and Salmond, who had been promoted to Major-General, was GOC RFC Middle East. Although Borton answered directly to Allenby for operational matters, Salmond maintained a keen interest in the activities of the Palestine Brigade. The Palestine Brigade consisted of the following two wings: *5th (Corps) Wing - tasked with aerial cooperation and direct support to Allenby's ground formations. *40th (Army) Wing - formed at the same time as the Palestine Brigade and tasked with counter-air missions and attacking the Ottoman and German support infrastructure. In addition, by the summer of 1918 the Brigade also had a balloon company, an aircraft park, an aircraft depot and an engine repair depot. In August, the Brigade was strengthened by the addition of a single Handley Page 0/400 biplane bomber which had been flown from England. Actions The Palestine Brigade saw action throughout the Palestine Campaign, most notably at the Battle of Megiddo when the retreating Ottoman Seventh Army was destroyed on Nablus-Beisan road by aerial attack.

Causes The cause of BFRBs is unknown. Emotional variables may have a differential impact on the expression of BFRBs. Research has suggested that the urge to repetitive self-injury is similar to a body-focused repetitive behavior but others have argued that for some the condition is more akin to a substance abuse disorder. Researchers are investigating a possible genetic component.ABC News 20/20 Hair Pulling, 2006 =Onset= BFRBs most often begin in late childhood or in the early teens. DiagnosisTypes= The main BFRB disorders are:Trichotillomania (TTM) & Related Body-Focused Repetitive Behaviors (BFRBs) , The Center for Emotional Health of Greater Philadelphia * Skin ** Dermatillomania (excoriation disorder), skin picking ** Dermatophagia, skin nibbling * Mouth ** Morsicatio buccarum, cheek biting ** Morsicatio labiorum, inner lip biting ** Morsicatio linguarum, tongue biting * Hands ** Onychophagia, nail biting ** Onychotillomania, nail picking * Nose ** Rhinotillexomania, compulsive nose picking * Hair ** Trichophagia, hair nibbling ** Trichotemnomania, hair cutting ** Trichotillomania, hair pulling * Eyes ** Mucus fishing syndrome - compulsion to remove or \\"fish\\" strands of mucus from the eye TreatmentPsychotherapy= Treatment can include behavior modification therapy, medication, and family therapy. The evidence base criteria for BFRBs is strict and methodical. Individual behavioral therapy has been shown as a \\"probably effective\\" evidence-based therapy to help with thumb sucking, and possibly nail biting. Cognitive behavioral therapy was cited as experimental evidence based therapy to treat trichotillomania and nail biting. Another form of treatment that focuses on mindfulness, stimuli and rewards has proven effective in some people. However, no treatment was deemed well-established to treat any form of BFRBs. =Pharmacotherapy= Excoriation disorder, and trichotillomania have been treated with inositol and N-acetylcysteine. Prevalence BFRBs are among the most poorly understood, misdiagnosed, and undertreated groups of disorders.Families & Health , American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy BFRBs may affect at least 1 out of 20 people. These collections of symptoms have been known for a number of years, but only recently have appeared in widespread medical literature.

She is a member of the Australian Labor Party.  Political career  Local Politics = Natalie was first elected to political office as a councillor at the City of Brimbank in 2000. She was re- elected in 2003 and 2005, and was mayor on three occasions. = State Politics = In 2008, Natalie unsuccessfully contested Labor preselection for the seat of Kororoit. In 2014 Natalie was preselected by the Labor Party to contest the seat of St Albans. St Albans was at the time a new safe seat for the Labor Party in Melbourne's western suburbs, having arisen through an electoral redistribution. Natalie was elected with 56.4% of the primary vote, and a two party preferred result of 67.5% the Liberal Party's candidate Moira Deeming. In 2018 Natalie was reelected to St Albans, with a 59.7% of the primary vote, and a two party preferred result of 71.5% against the Liberal Party. = Federal politics = In 2018, a plan emerged to preselect Natalie for the newly created safe federal seat of Fraser. This plan faced internal backlash within the Labor Party, with Crikey reporting that the suggestion had \\"sent the party into conniptions\\" because of Suleyman's association with the \\"chaotic\\" Brimbank City Council. Reportedly, \\"many in the party were aghast at the idea of parachuting Ms Suleyman (into the seat)\\". In response, an plan to preselect Daniel Mulino for the seat was put forward. Mulino eventually gained preselection of the seat after support from his associated union within the party. The party's manuevering to achieve this outcome caused a reshuffle in the Labor Party at both state and federal levels. Misconduct findings In June 2008, Natalie contested ALP preselection for the state seat of Kororoit. The Victorian Ombudsman found that in order to ensure her preselection, she organised a deal with former Keilor state Member George Seitz whereby she would arrange for the funding of certain soccer-ground works, in return for his support at preselection. This gambit failed when Seitz unexpectedly withdrew his support, and the preselection was instead won by Marlene Kairouz. The Ombudsman found that Suleyman then attempted to cancel funding for the project associated with Seitz, a move that would have cost the council more than $300,000. These events led to Seitz invoking Parliamentary privilege to criticise Suleyman on the floor of the Victorian Parliament. Seitz's comments, widely reported, included an accusation that Suleyman was the \\"Robert Mugabe of Brimbank\\", and had improperly interfered with local sporting clubs associated with Seitz; in response to her lost preselection. Resultant reporting prompted an investigation by the Victorian Ombudsman into alleged misconduct at Brimbank Council. Regarding the allegations made by Seitz in parliament, the Ombudsman found that Natalie had indeed directed the council CEO to withdraw funding from development works at the Keilor Lodge Reserve, which 'had the CEO complied with the direction, (would have put the council) in breach of contract and at significant financial risk'. Natalie's explanation to the ombudsman that she was not involved in the issuing of the direction was found by the ombudsman to have been 'an attempt to mislead', with a finding made that 'the direction was issued in retalation for Suleyman's pre-selection loss'. This led to a further finding that Suleyman had breached s76B(3) of the Local Government Act, having made improper use of her position. The ombudsman recommended that the breach be investigated by the Victorian department responsible for local government. The other significant finding within the report, was that Suleyman had made an improper and informal demand that $680,000 be allocated to a project at Cairnlea Park, at a facility in which clubs to which Suleyman's family were linked. The ombudsman found that after the budget had been finalised at a council workshop, Suleyman had approached council staff and threatened to prevent the budget from being adopted unless her projects were funded. The council executive were found to have altered in scope several council items to ensure the demand could be accommodated. The ombudsman found that: > \\"The alleged actions of Cr Suleyman appeared to breach the councillor oath > of office, which requires that councillors act in the best interests of the > community. It is also clearly a misuse of Cr Suleyman‚Äôs position as a > councillor. In addition, I was concerned that the Brimbank officers acceded > to Cr Suleyman‚Äôs ‚Äòdemand‚Äô without referring the matter to the whole > council.\\" Other findings regarding Suleyman's conduct included: Alt URL * A misuse of council processes to further harass Seitz. * Findings of abuse and aggression toward Council officers. * An improper insistence that council spend $572 on library membership cards bearing her signature. * Inappropriate disposal of confidential council documents. * Enabling the rent-free access of her father to a council building with an ordinary annual lease value of over $15,000 (since 1999); and improperly accessing council files relating to that building. In 2006, following public scrutiny of this arrangement in a local newspaper, the property's $1,700 per year peppercorn lease (drawn up by the council in 2002) was then complied with. The ombudsman also found that Natalie had been involved in procuring $11,000 worth of building works for the benefit of her father at the property, writing 'It is apparent that Mr Suleyman received favourable treatment due to his daughter's influence'. Natalie denied these findings. * An Engagement of 'subterfuge' against the Ombudsman, by having manipulated another councillor to sign a complaint letter to the Ombudsman in their name, when the letter had in fact been written by Natalie and another councillor. The Local Government Inspectorate took no action against Natalie in the wake of the report. In a letter seen by the local newspaper Brimbank Weekly the inspectorate claimed to have found 'insufficient evidence to support a prosecution'. The Ombudsman's report led to the passage of new laws banning councillors from working as staffers to members of Parliament. It also played a role in the eventual sacking of Brimbank Council in 2009.

Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species on 2012-06-17 Taxonomic history The use of the genus name Glossodoris has been a subject of debate amongst taxonomists for over 150 years. Because it is the oldest name in the Chromodorididae it has been used differently by different taxonomists, sometimes including many species of Hypselodoris and Chromodoris and the other smaller genera recognised today. Its modern status is based on the analysis of DNA sequences.Johnson, R.F. & Gosliner, T.M. (2012).

He was the son of Mohammed Ayub and Khair ul Nissah. He received his early education from Mand High School in his hometown and later graduated from SM College, Karachi, in 1984. Ghulam Mohammed Baloch was married twice. He has a daughter and two sons from his first wife, Najma, and a son and a daughter from his second wife, Salma.  Politics  Ghulam Mohammed Baloch first entered politics during his school years under the patronage of his mentor Fida Ahmad Baloch, a legendary leader of the Baloch Students Organization who happened to be a teacher at Mand High School. Ghulam Mohammed Baloch joined the Baloch Students Organization in 1974. In 1990, he was elected as its chairman. In 1992, he joined the Balochistan National Movement. In 2004, he founded the Baloch National Movement saying that he did not see a future for the Baloch within the framework of Pakistan. Although he advocated for an independent Balochistan throughout his political career, he was regarded as the face of the renewed movement for a separate Baloch homeland which started after 2002. For this, he was imprisoned by the Pakistani security forces on a number of occasions. He was first arrested by the Pakistan army on December 3, 2006, from Karachi during a public gathering. He was held incommunicado for around a year before being shifted to a jail in Turbat in 2007. He was later released. He was subjected to severe mental and physical torture during his enforced disappearance which impaired his eyesight and listening faculties.  Death  On April 3, 2009, Ghulam Mohammed Baloch along with two other Baloch politicians were kidnapped by gunmen who were allegedly communicating in Persian from baloch's lawyer chamber in Turbat, Balochistan. Their bullet-riddled bodies were found on April 9, 2009, in Murgaap, Turbat. Baloch Liberation Army, a terrorist organisation, alleged that Pakistani security forces are behind the murder of the three politicians. However, international experts have deemed it odd that the Pakistani forces would be careless enough to allow the bodies to be found so easily and light Balochistan on fire if they were truly responsible. His assassination sparked widespread protests and riots throughout Balochistan and Karachi. Protesters burnt government properties and paralyzed life in Balochistan for over three days.

It was designed by renowned theatre architect John Eberson with funding from a group of local investors and opened on September 4, 1922. Architecture The theater it was one of three early theatres designed with elements of what would become known as the atmospheric style. Wichita's Orpheum design was that of a Spanish garden and courtyard.Eberson, John. ‚ÄúNew Theatres for Old.‚Äù Motion Picture News, December 30, 1927. The 42ft (13m) high by 40ft (12m) wide proscenium arch is the main feature of the auditorium. The sidewalls of the auditorium were accented by niches with mock tile roofs, grills, and wood lattice arches across the ceiling to create a courtyard effect.Eberson, John. ‚ÄúNew Theatres for Old.‚Äù Motion Picture News, December 30, 1927. While the theatre was originally designed with 1,700 seats, it now seats 1,286. Theatre interior History Originally built as a vaudeville venue, the theatre underwent conversion into a movie house in 1929 and for decades it presented both movies and live entertainment. Throughout the 1920s, the Chicago based Orpheum circuit brought famous names like: Al Jolson, Fannie Brice, Jack Benny, George Burns, Louis Armstrong, Ella Fitzgerald, Gracie Allen, Gypsy Rose Lee, Bing Crosby, Mickey Rooney, and Harry Houdini to Wichita's Orpheum Theatre. Admission to these shows would generally cost between $0.40 and $0.75. In addition to these live acts, the Orpheum was one of the first theatres to show D.W. Griffith's Birth of a Nation and hosted the Kansas premier of Gone with the Wind in 1940. With the economic boom brought on by 1930s and 1940s defense spending, the Orpheum was kept open 24 hours a day to accommodate the many shifts of workers building airplanes for the war effort.Wondra, Keith. From the Lands of Andalusia to the Wheat Fields of Kansas: A History of Wichita's Historic Orpheum Theatre. Wichita State University, 2010. Closing and Rebirth In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the advent of multiplex movie theatres caused attendance at the Orpheum to drop significantly. Orpheum management tried to keep the venue open with martial arts films and even a brief foray into adult films. These efforts failed and the theatre closed its doors in November of 1976. The final film shown was a martial arts film titled The Bodyguard. After stripping the building of its material value, including the seats, the theatre was abandoned and left to rot. In order to keep the city of Wichita from demolishing the historic theatre, two local businesswomen, Meredith \\"Milly\\" Hill and Marge Setter, created a group called \\"Save the Orpheum\\". Their efforts, along with local attorney Stan Wisdom, saved the building from the wrecking ball, virtually at the last minute. Advocacy from other concerned citizens continued and the City of Wichita designated the Orpheum Theatre as an historic landmark in 1978. In 1980, the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places. A nonprofit 501(c)(3) organization called the Orpheum Performing Arts Centre LTD was then formed to take ownership of the theatre. Various legal entanglements complicated ownership of the office complex adjacent to the theatre, until a US District Judge signed an order dismissing the nonprofit group from the lawsuits. In 1992 clear title and ownership of the theatre was formally handed to the nonprofit. However, much work needed to be done in order to restore it to an operational condition.Wondra, Keith. From the Lands of Andalusia to the Wheat Fields of Kansas: A History of Wichita's Historic Orpheum Theatre. Wichita State University, 2010. Restoration Before restoration could begin, the building had to be completely cleaned, as it was made uninhabitable by teeming refuse left over from years of abandonment. The roof leaked and needed to be repaired, several walls needed to be re- stabilized, much of the interior paint had peeled, plaster had fallen out of the roof and walls, and much of the exterior brick needed to be replaced. Because the seating had been removed and sold during the closing, the Orpheum board installed used seating taken from various sources throughout Wichita, including a former theatre at Towne East Mall and an auditorium at City Hall. After these basic renovations had taken place, attention was turned to upgrading the theatre's interior functions. An updated heating and air conditioning system was installed in 2001, a new marquee and updated restrooms were added in 2002, the lobby concession area was restored in 2005, the lobby vestibule restored in 2007, exterior brick and roof repair completed in 2010, new LED lights acquired and installed in 2010, exit corridors and doors were repaired and a new handicap ramp was installed in 2012, the projection booth was restored in 2013, and most recently, the auditorium foyer and east stair tower were restored in 2015. Areas still to be addressed are new auditorium flooring, seating, decorative plaster work, and significant stage upgrades. The Orpheum Today Wichita's Orpheum theatre is still owned by the nonprofit Orpheum Performing Arts Centre LTD, and is managed by international venue management firm, SMG. The venue is host to over 100 shows each year from all genres of entertainment. Nationally renowned performers regularly grace the historic Orpheum theatre stage, recent performers include: Dave Chapelle , \\"Weird Al\\" Yankovic, Elvis Costello, Keb' Mo', William Shatner, Lewis Black, Steven Stills, Judy Collins, Paula Poundstone, Black Violin, Halestorm, David Blaine, Diana Krall, and David Sedaris, and most recently the cult classic hit tour of Mystery Science Theater 3000 Live! Additionally, the theatre is a primary venue for the annual Tallgrass Film Festival and curates its own annual film series. thumb See also *Movie palaces list ReferencesExternal links *Wichita Orpheum website Category:Theatres in Kansas Category:Theatres completed in 1922 Category:Buildings and structures in Wichita, Kansas Category:John Eberson buildings Category:Culture of Wichita, Kansas Category:Theatres on the National Register of Historic Places in Kansas Category:Atmospheric theatres Category:National Register of Historic Places in Wichita, Kansas Category:1922 establishments in Kansas ","title":"Orpheum Theatre (Wichita, Kansas)"},{"id":"21738626","text":"Racine Unified School District (RUSD) is a school district serving the eastern portion of Racine County, Wisconsin.

History Several species of Chrysopsis previously unknown to science have been discovered in recent decades. Among these, is Chrysopsis delaneyi, \\"DeLaney's goldenaster\\", which was discovered in the mid-1980s by Kris DeLaney, a central Florida botanist. Habitat Chrysopsis delaneyi is endemic to Florida, where it is highly endangered and has a very restricted range. By the mid 20th century most of its original longleaf pine / turkey oak sandhill ecosystem and habitat were removed by corporate citrus farming. Most of the Chrysopsis species are endemic to Florida, being limited to relatively small regions of Florida's well-drained, sandy ridges. The plants occur in dry, nutrient-poor, xeric upland ecosystems, including sand pine scrub, longleaf pine / turkey oak sandhills. They are weakly perennial in habit, bright green, tall and leafy, produce large, \\"lettuce-like\\" rosettes, and are covered with viscid (resin-producing) hairs (glandular-stipitate trichomes). The flowers are borne at the tops of leafy stems that are up to 1.5 m tall, and are bright yellow and range from about 2.4 cm to 5.0 cm in diameter. Description Chrysopsis delaneyi is morphologically and genetically variable. It is represented by a complex of ecotypes and/or varieties associated and adapted to Florida's major ridges and discrete upland systems. The plant is restricted primarily to four major metapopulations: Lake Wales Ridge (LWR), Orange County Ridge (OCR), southern Atlantic Coastal Ridge (ACR), and a system of geologically younger, lower ridges between the LWR and ACR. [the ridges are generally as per described and mapped by William White (1970); Geomorphology of Florida, USGS]. Chrysopsis delaneyi was formally described in 2003,DeLaney, K. R., R. P. Wunderlin, and J. C. Semple. (2003) Chrysopsis delaneyi (Asteraceae, Astereae), another new species from peninsular Florida . The Botanical Explorer. and named in honor of its discoverer. Although locally abundant at some small sites, the species is highly endangered due to a near complete loss of its original habitat. Morphological and genetic analysis suggests that the metapopulations of C. delaneyi may actually represent distinct taxa which may have arisen from genetic bottle-necking and subsequent long-term, island-like biogeographic isolation. Kris DeLaney (1951-*) has discovered many other new species of plants in central Florida, including a second golden aster, C. highlandsensis (Highlands County goldenaster).

Macwhinnie founded the Hong Kong Society of Accountants, serving as its president from 1973 to 1974, which earned him the unofficial title ‚Äúfather of modern accountancy in Hong Kong‚Äù. He was chairman of several companies, a member of government committees and the driving force behind the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. Early years Gordon Menzies Macwhinnie (sometimes incorrectly spelled as MacWhinnie) was born in Tramore, Ireland, his father having relocated from Scotland. His father started work as a stockbroker in London and the family moved again, this time to Chipstead, Surrey. He was educated at the Westminster School. WWII During World War II Macwhinnie served as a captain with Number 1 Commando with 3 Commando Brigade in Burma and the Far East. In January 1945, during the third Arakan campaign, the whole brigade was landed at Kangaw, opposite the point of the Myebon peninsula. The Japanese were ready and the commandos' fighting skills and determination were stretched to the maximum in order to hold Hill 170 until the arrival of the leading brigade of the 25th Indian Division. There was bitter hand-to-hand fighting. At the end of the war Macwhinnie was posted to Hong Kong and put in charge of Stanley prison, which had actually housed Japanese officers. Career After he was demobbed he undertook articles with Peat Marwick Mitchell. He had been impressed by Hong Kong during his brief army service there and was delighted when he was sent by Peat Marwick back to the territory in 1950 to join its branch there. He became a senior partner in 1968 and retired from the company, now called KPMG, in 1978. During those ten years he served on a number of government committees, mostly concerning business practice and ethics. In 1973, he began founding the Hong Kong Society of Accountants (HKSA) to counter the severe shortage of accountants. He introduced the territory's own system of certification so that local people could become chartered accountants. Prior to this only chartered accountants from the United Kingdom and Australia worked in accountancy in Hong Kong. He was the first president of the HKSA, which started with a membership of 566, and is now known as the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (or HKICPA), boasting more than 25,000 members. The HKICPA later lost the authority to investigate malpractice, with the setting up of the Financial Reporting Council by the Hong Kong government. Macwhinnie publicly criticised the change, saying: ‚ÄúIt is a crazy idea to let someone outside the profession discuss accountancy cases. Accountants are all well trained and the profession worked well with the self-regulatory model.‚Äù After his retirement in 1978, Macwhinnie, who had been a member of the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club since he arrived in the territory and was elected a steward in 1974, became chairman, serving from 1989 to 1991. Death Gordon Macwhinnie died in 2007, aged 84, from undisclosed causes. He is survived by his wife, Marjorie, whom he married in 1948, their two sons Ian and Anthony, his four granddaughters and one great grandson Remy Macwhinnie. Honours Gordon Macwhinnie was appointed OBE in 1977 and advanced to CBE in 1984. He was knighted in 1992.

The clash occurred at the small village of Bornh√∂ft in what is now Schleswig-Holstein in north Germany. The engagement occurred during the War of the Sixth Coalition, part of the Napoleonic Wars, and was the last time Swedish and Danish forces met on the battlefield.  Battle  Crown prince Charles John led a division of the northern armies, including the M√∂rners husarregemente (later the Kronprinsens husarregemente), under the command of the commander of the Swedish cavalry Anders Fredrik Skj√∂ldebrand, to pursue the retreating Danish army. The idea was for the Swedish cavalry to advance in parallel to the Danes until general Wallmoden could cut off their retreat and force the outmanoeuvred Danes to surrender. Charles John had been very economical with Swedish forces throughout the war and deliberately held back to allow the allies to take huge losses whilst he held onto the Swedish forces for future use. The Swedish cavalry thus felt left out of all the war's previous major battles this in addition to their regiment not seeing combat in the 1808-9 war that lost Finland made them disobey their orders and ride straight against the Danish forces. It then clashed with the Danish rearguard (made up of Polish ulans, an elite force sent out by Napoleon to cover the Danish retreat) throughout the day until in the evening the Swedes met the main Danish force gathered at Bornh√∂ved. This 2,500 strong Danish force was made up of infantry, cavalry and artillery and would not normally have considered the advance guard of the Swedish cavalry as a major threat (since in such difficult terrain and so close to nightfall a frontal cavalry assault on the massed infantry with artillery support would be pure folly), but since their rearguard was still embroiled in fighting with Swedish patrols the Danes formed up in ranks and waited. First came the Danish rearguard, still harried by some Swedish squadrons under major Fritz von der Lancken and finally dispersed by the Swedish assault. The attackers then turned on the main Danish force and the Danes staked all their forces at once, with a Swedish reconnaissance beaten off and von der Lancken in retreat. In the meantime the main Swedish force began to form up. With seven squadrons totalling 471 men, commanded by Colonel Bror Cederstr√∂m, the Swedish cavalry immediately moved to the attack, broke up the Danish formations and drove them into retreat. The Swedish victory at Bornh√∂ved came to be an important step towards Sweden's goal of taking Norway from Denmark, ultimately achieved in the Treaty of Kiel.

She was born in Mexico, raised and educated in the U.S., and returned to Mexico in the 1920s following the Mexican Revolution. She coined the term 'Mexican Renaissance',Anita Brenner, \\"A Mexican Renascence.\\" Arts 12 (September 1925): 127-50 \\"to describe the cultural florescence [that] emerged from the revolution.\\"L√≥pez, \\"Anita Brenner\\", p. 123. As a child of immigrants, Brenner's heritage caused her to experience both antisemitism and acceptance. Fleeing discrimination in Texas, she found mentors and colleagues among the European Jewish diaspora living in both Mexico and New York, but Mexico, not the US or Europe, held her loyalty and enduring interest. She was part of the post-Revolutionary art movement known for its indigenista ideology. Brenner earned a PhD in anthropology at Columbia University and her first book, Idols Behind Altars was the first book to document the artworks, styles and artists of Mexico from Prehistory through the 1920s. It was widely considered her most important work and was filled with photographs by renowned photographers and interviews with the most influential and prolific artists of the period. Her fourth published book was The Wind That Swept Mexico; The History of the Mexican Revolution, 1910-1942, having in between printed a guidebook and a children's story. The first book to give a complete account in either English or Spanish on the Mexican Revolution, it was the first to retell the events from a Mexican perspective. Early life Anita Brenner was born 13 August 1905 in Aguascalientes, Mexico to Isador and Paula Brenner. Her birth name was registered as Hanna. Her parents were Jewish emigrants to Mexico from Latvia, and her father moved his family back and forth from Mexico to Texas during the Mexican Revolution. In 1916 when Brenner was 11, the family settled in San Antonio, Texas, but Brenner's nanny influenced her enduring passion for Mexico. She briefly attended Our Lady of the Lake University and then took an English course with J. Frank Dobie at the University of Texas at Austin. After two semesters she was able to persuade her father to let her return to Mexico, since she felt excluded by her university peers because of their antisemitism. After her father had secured promises from Joseph Weinberger, of B'nai B'rith, a Jewish service organization, and his wife Frances Toor that they would look after her, Isador agreed to let Anita go. She moved to Mexico around the age of 18 and settled in Mexico City. Frances Toor introduced Brenner to the community of international artists, refugees, and intellectuals then residing in the capital. Brenner became an important member of this cosmopolitan circle and was an important link among them. She was also an important voice for bringing the Mexican artistic florescence to the attention of readers in the U.S., effectively representing it north of the Mexican border.Helen Delpar, The Enormous Vogue of Things Mexican: Cultural Relations between the United States and Mexico, 1920-1935. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press 1992, p. 40.Gilbert M. Joseph, \\"Revolutionary Encounters of the Transnational Kind: Cross-Border Collaborations, Border Thinking, and the Politics of Mexican State Formation\\" in Open Borders to a Revolution, Jaime Marroqu√≠n et al. eds., p. 244. For the first time in her life, Brenner felt accepted and began to explore her Jewish roots. She worked for a brief period at B'nai B'rith, meeting recent Jewish immigrants at the port of Veracruz and helping them with their paperwork and resettlement. Brenner quickly became part of the leftist bohemian group and as a journalist was a key voice in the indigenismo movement. Carleton Beals and Ernest Gruening were influential U.S. journalists who Brenner met in this early period of her career. Beals helped her launch her publishing career. She was Gruening's research assistant for his book, Mexico and Its Heritage, which he spent five years developing in Mexico before it was published in 1928. In 1924, her first published article was \\"The Jew in Mexico,\\" published by The Nation, which Gruening had edited from 1920-1923. President Plutarco El√≠as Calles (1924‚Äì28) heard about her and offered her a scholarship to participate in the cultural preservation program. At that time in Mexico, the Secretariat of Education (SEP) had established a cultural missions program, which began in 1923, where young people traveled the country and helped preserve indigenous culture. Concha Michel, a friend of Anita's, participated in a similar program and gathered indigenous folk songs. In 1926, Brenner commissioned her friends Tina Modotti and Edward Weston to travel with her and take photographs for her upcoming book on Mexican decorative arts. The National Autonomous University of Mexico was providing funding for a two- volume series in which Brenner planned to document artworks in Guanajuato, Jalisco, Michoacan, Oaxaca, Puebla and Quer√©taro. Modotti and Weston also took personal photographs of Brenner. The differences between them point to the different aesthetics of the photographers. Weston was known for the abstract qualities of his highly focused and \\"precisely composed black-and-white images of semi-abstract nudes, landscapes, and organic forms\\". His photographs of Brenner's back are devoid of human interest and a study of form. In Modotti's images she attempted to capture scenes and personality, and social context over form were emphasized. Her photographs of Brenner show her dressed in a man's suit and fedora. Though feminists of later decades saw these photographs as uninhibited gender expression, Brenner was discreet about her sexuality and like most of the female artists of the period was not a feminist. Their works questioned their personal restrictions, but not as a feminist statement for society. New York years In 1927, Brenner left Mexico for New York to attend Columbia University. She had served as translator and editor for Manuel Gamio, a leading Mexican anthropologist and was encouraged to pursue a doctorate by Franz Boas, the \\"founding father of American anthropology\\". In 1929, she was finally able to publish her book on Mexican artwork, but instead of the two volumes originally planned, she published one volume entitled Idols Behind Altars, with the New York trade publisher, Harcourt, Brace. The main premise of the book was that behind the Spanish \\"altars\\", visible Hispanic, Catholic culture, lay the \\"idols\\", invisible authentic culture of the real Mexico, which the \\"Mexican Renaissance\\" was rediscovering. It was well received and is considered her most important work. It was the first attempt to permanently record art throughout the country, as well as analyze the works, styles and artists of Mexico. According to Katherine Anne Porter's review, it reads like a \\"who's who\\" of the Mexican art scene of the 1920s, including Abraham √Ångel, Adolfo Best-Maugard, Jean Charlot, Xavier Guerrero, Carlos M√©rida, Gerardo Murillo Cornado (aka Dr. Atl), Jos√© Clemente Orozco, Diego Rivera, and David Alfaro Siqueiros and explains the intricate interlacing of their community of foreigners, second generation emigrants, and native born artists who have restored the \\"Indian\\" imagery of Mexico. Although she never finished a bachelor's or master's degree, nor done field work at the site in 1930, Brenner submitted her PhD dissertation in anthropology on the ancient site of Colhuacan. After her successful defense of her thesis, she completed her degree and was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1930 to study the geographical extent of Aztec art in Mexico and at various museums in Europe.Delpar, The Enormous Vogue of Things Mexican, p. 76 In her travels throughout Europe she wrote articles for The New York Times and served as a war correspondent during the Spanish Civil War. Brenner's travels through Mexico with the fellowship resulted in a travel book entitled Your Mexican Holiday which was published in 1932. The next decade of her life was spent in the publication of hundreds of articles which appeared in \\"The Nation (seventeen articles) and the New York Times Sunday Magazine (twenty articles), ... Mademoiselle, and ... the Brooklyn Daily Eagle (fifty articles), as well as stories of Mexican art, culture, refugees and politics which were chronicled in the Jewish press ‚Äì the Menorah Journal, the Jewish Morning Journal, The Jewish Daily Forward, and the Jewish Telegraphic Agency. During this period, Brenner helped many of Mexico's artists navigate the U.S. audiences. She introduced Jos√© Clemente Orozco to Alma Reed who helped plan his first New York showing and guided his career. She and Orozco later had a falling out.Delpar, Enormous Vogue, p. 84. She wrote reviews and helped with the translation of Mariano Azuela's The Underdogs, which sold 3,000 copies, she promoted Diego Rivera, though they at times had a contentious relationship, as well as Carlos M√©ridaDelpar (1992) p 179, p 85, pp 123-128, p 142 and David Alfaro Siqueiros. Politics Many of the Mexican artists of the post-Revolutionary decades accepted that the government endorsement of using art to educate the largely uneducated public was a tacit approval to produce art heavily reflecting communist ideology. Revolutionary themes and communism combined in many works of the period. But the 1930s were turbulent times, Mexican communists were sometimes embraced and sometimes not embraced by their US and Soviet counterparts. Brenner was a sympathizer, like others of Mexican avant‚Äìgarde, who were sometimes Communist Party members and sometimes not. In 1926 when the journal New Masses was launched, Brenner was classed as a fellow traveler, but not a party member. As an independent reporter in Spain, Brenner evaluated the Russian role in the Spanish Civil War. She found evidence that the Gosudarstvennoye Politicheskoye Upravlenie (GPU), the Russian secret police, intimidated anarchists and socialists in an effort to silence critics of the Comintern and she criticized Stalin's move away from helping workers and into Marxist factionalism. In the view she supported, Stalin would be the only one who would benefit from the adoption of Communism by the Spanish Government. In 1934 Anita and 24 others signed an open letter on their anti-Stalin stance and received negative reviews from New Masses, which had become the leading Communist journal, branding her a Trotskyist. She responded in an individual letter stating that the role of the intellectual was to question and criticize. By stifling criticism the Communist Party was refusing to allow intellectuals to do their jobs. Brenner occasionally wrote under a pseudonym \\"Jean Mendez\\" for Troskyist newspapers. In 1936, it was Brenner who sent a telegram from New York to Diego Rivera asking him to use his influence to find Leon Trotsky a safe haven in Mexico. Trotsky had been in exile for nine years, and Norway was in the process of expelling him. Brenner, on behalf of the Trotskyite Fourth International, asked Rivera to assist in the crisis and secure asylum. Rivera immediately contacted President L√°zaro C√°rdenas and secured the necessary agreement. Return to Mexico Brenner, her husband and two children emigrated to Mexico in 1940, to the farm in Aguascalientes her family had left when they moved to Texas. She re- established it for specialty agricultural produce and grew asparagus and garlic. Brenner continued to publish in the U.S. and renewed her lifelong friendship with Jean Charlot to collaborate on several children's books. In 1943 she published her fourth book, The Wind That Swept Mexico, for which she wrote the text, with George R. Leighton, publishing the vivid photos. which was the first complete account in either the English‚Äìlanguage or Spanish recounting the events that occurred during the Mexican Revolution. It was also the first telling in English that gave a Mexican perspective of the conflict. Many versions of the events of the war had been printed in the US, but mainly those were journalism pieces which negatively reported on events in Mexico. In particular, pieces by William Randolph Hearst's papers were designed to arouse anti-Mexican feeling to protect his own land holdings in Mexico. Brenner defended Mexico's right to determine its own path without foreign intervention. The book was widely acclaimed at the time, and was received well when it was reprinted in the 1970s. In 1955, Brenner established a monthly publication, Mexico/This Month. Her familiarity with both sides of the border gave her the expertise to make Mexico known to an English-speaking public. When the Mexican government awarded her the Order of the Aztec Eagle, the highest honor Mexico can award a non-national, she refused it, on the grounds that she was Mexican by birth. She did accept a citation as a distinguished tourism pioneer awarded by former president Miguel Alem√°n Vald√©s in 1967. Personal life In July, 1930 Brenner married David Glusker, from whom she separated in 1951 ten years prior to his death in 1961. She was survived by two children, her daughter, Susannah Joel Glusker, who teaches at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City, and her son, Dr. Peter Glusker, a physician with a medical practice in Fort Bragg, California. Two posthumous volumes were released after Brenner's death, by Susannah Joel Glusker, Brenner's daughter. Avant-Garde Art & Artists in Mexico, 2-Volume Set: Anita Brenner's Journals of the Roaring Twenties was prepared using diaries and notes Brenner had made and span the period from 1925 until her marriage in 1930 and photographs from Brenner's files.

Susannah Glusker wrote a biography of her mother entitled Anita Brenner: A Mind of Her Own Susannah Joel Glusker, Anita Brenner: A Mind of her Own. Austin:University of Texas Press: 1998; ) She died in Ojuelos de Jalisco, 83 km east of Aguascalientes, in an automobile accident on 1 December 1974, aged 69. Legacy Brenner remains an important figure in post-Revolutionary art and history in Mexico, an enthusiast for Mexican art and culture and an active advocate for its importance to a U.S. audience. A prolific scholar and journalist herself, she has been the subject of studies by Mexicanist scholars.

It is named for Saint Charles Borromeo and it is the seminary of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia. The seminary is accredited by both the Middle States Commission on Higher Education and the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada. It consists of four divisions: College Seminary, Theological Seminary, the School of Theological Studies and the School of Diaconal Formation. Potential candidates for the priesthood pursue a program which consists of a five-year liberal arts curriculum (which includes a Spiritual Year) followed by a four-year curriculum within the Theological Seminary. The seminary offers the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Master of Arts in Philosophical Studies (M.A.P.S.), Master of Divinity, and Master of Arts in Theology. History The Eakins Room at the seminary contains six portraits by Thomas Eakins. St. Charles Borromeo Seminary was founded in 1832 by Bishop Francis Kenrick, the third Bishop of Philadelphia and is the oldest Catholic institution of higher learning in the Philadelphia region. The seminary was initially located at the home of Bishop Kenrick on Fifth Street in Philadelphia. In 1838, it was chartered to grant academic degrees. Circumstances required the subsequent relocation of the seminary to the northwest corner of Fifth and Prune Streets, then to Saint Mary's Rectory on Fourth Street, and eventually to the southeast corner of Eighteenth and Race Streets in Philadelphia before moving, in 1871, to its present home in Overbrook. In 1863 Bishop James F. Wood made the first of three purchases of the property that today comprises the campus of Overbrook. In September, 1871, the preparatory college and theology divisions were reunited on the present campus. In December, 1875, the Chapel of the Immaculate Conception was formally dedicated by Archbishop Wood (who reached that rank when Philadelphia became an archdiocese in 1875). Subsequent Archbishops of Philadelphia have initiated improvements on the Seminary campus. Archbishop Patrick J. Ryan began the building of the library. Archbishop Edmond Prendergast oversaw the building of a student residence hall. Dennis Cardinal Dougherty sponsored the construction of the college building. John Cardinal O'Hara added an indoor swimming pool to the physical assets of the Seminary. In 1971, under the leadership of John Cardinal Krol, a residence hall and multi-purpose building dedicated to Saint John Vianney was constructed. In 2005, the Anthony Cardinal Bevilacqua Research Center was established at the Ryan Memorial Library. The building was completely renovated in the process. The buildings that make up the current Theology Division along with the Ryan Memorial Library stand at the western end of campus. The College Seminary is located at the eastern end. For an eleven-year period the preparatory division of the seminary was located at Glen Riddle in Delaware County. The preparatory program consisted at that time of what is equivalent to today's last two years of high school and four years of college. The high school program was discontinued in 1968. In 1999, an alumnus praised St. Charles for its liturgical conservatism compared to some other US seminaries. After his successor, Cardinal Justin Francis Rigali, was named in 2003, Cardinal Anthony Joseph Bevilacqua, the former Archbishop of Philadelphia, lived here in his retirement. Pope Francis stayed at Saint Charles Borromeo Seminary during his visit to Philadelphia in 2015. Pope John Paul II (now a saint) visited the seminary in 1979. The seminary also hosted Cardinal Ratzinger (now Pope Benedict XVI) several times before he was made Pope. In 2019, the seminary sold the Wynnewood property to Main Line Health and will be moving. The proceeds from the purchase will go toward building a new campus. Dioceses and congregations At the start of the 2020-2021 academic year, the seminary welcomed 27 new men to campus. The total enrollment of 156 seminarians are studying for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, 12 partner dioceses, and six religious orders. Saint Charles Borromeo Seminary's partner dioceses include: Diocese of Allentown; Diocese of Arlington; Diocese of Greensburg; Diocese of Harrisburg; Diocese of Lincoln; Diocese of Raleigh; Diocese of Trenton; Diocese of Mymensingh, Bangladesh, Diocese of Steubenville; Ukrainian Archeparchy of Philadelphia; Archdiocese for the Military Services, USA; and Archdiocese of Colombo, Sri Lanka. The partner religious congregations and orders include: Mercedarian Friars, Vincentians, Norbertines, Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, Congregation of the Oratory and Pallottines.

Ltd., a shipyard in Glasgow, Scotland. The 120 metre, four-decked vessel travelled mostly between the Persian Gulf and the Indian subcontinent, carrying expatriate passengers who were employed in the Gulf. Dara sank in the Persian Gulf on 8 April 1961, as a result of a powerful explosion that caused the deaths of 238 of the 819 persons on board at the time of the voyage, including 19 officers and 113 crew. Another 565 persons were rescued during an operation by a British Army tank landing craft, a number of ships of the Royal Navy, and several British and foreign merchant ships.\\"165 MISSING FROM THE DARA\\", The Glasgow Herald, April 10, 1961, p1 Sinking The vessel had sailed from Bombay on 23 May, on a round trip to Basra, calling at intermediate ports. She arrived at Dubai on 7 April and was unloading cargo, embarking and disembarking passengers when the wind picked up, quickly reaching force seven winds and preventing further work. The Dara had been hit by another boat which had dragged its anchor in the bad weather and Captain Elson decided to take the ship out of harbour to ride the storm. Due to the conditions there had been no time to disembark those persons on board who did not intend to travel, including relatives and friends seeing off passengers, cargo handlers and various shipping and immigration officials. At approximately 04.30 on 8 April 1961, a large explosion struck the port side of the engine casing between decks, passing through the engine bulkhead and two upper decks, including the main lounge. The explosion had occurred as Dara was returning to the harbour and it started a series of large fires. The explosion having affected all electrical, fire-water and steering systems, the fire spread rapidly, aided by the wind, and the captain ordered the evacuation of the ship. The launching of the lifeboats was chaotic in the rough seas, with one witness describing an overcrowded lifeboat overturning due to the height of the waves. A second lifeboat had been damaged earlier during the storm, this ailing lifeboat would later be intercepted by the lifeboat of a Norwegian tanker. At the time there were several ships nearby and aid was given by British, German and Japanese vessels in the vicinity, as well as boats travelling out from Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman and Umm Al Qawain. A nearly completed hotel building in Dubai was taken over as a reception centre for the wounded, with many suffering from burns, exposure and wounds from flying metal shards. The tide of wounded overwhelmed Al Maktoum Hospital and field stations were opened at Sheikh Rashid's Customs House office block. In the days following, three British frigates and a US destroyer sent parties on board the Dara to extinguish the fires and the vessel was then taken in tow by the Glasgow salvage vessel Ocean Salvor, but she sank at 09.20 on 10 April 1961. The explosion is believed to have been caused by a deliberately placed explosive device, planted by an Omani rebel group or individual insurgents. A British Admiralty court concluded, more than a year after the disaster, that an anti-tank mine, \\"deliberately placed by a person or persons unknown\\", had \\"almost certainly\\" caused the explosion.\\"Court Finds Bomb Sank Liner With 238 In Persian Gulf\\", Toledo Blade, April 19, 1962, p. 22 British Solicitor General Sir John Hobson, testifying before the court, said that fighters in the Dhofar Rebellion were likely responsible, having previously sabotaged British assets.

In particular, the catu·π£ko·π≠i is a \\"four-cornered\\" system of argumentation that involves the systematic examination of each of the 4 possibilities of a proposition, P: # P; that is being. # not P; that is not being. # P and not P; that is being and that is not being. # not (P or not P); that is neither being nor that is not being. These four statements hold the following properties: (1) each alternative is mutually exclusive (that is, one of, but no more than one of, the four statements is true) and (2) that all the alternatives are together exhaustive (that is, at least one of them must necessarily be true). This system of logic not only provides a novel method of classifying propositions into logical alternatives, but also because it does so in such a manner that the alternatives are not dependent on the number of truth-values assumed in the system of logic. HistoryVedas= Antecedents of the Catu·π£ko·π≠i have been charted to grammatical structures in the Vedas. The Nasadiya Sukta of the Rigveda (RV 10.129) contains ontological speculation in terms of various logical divisions that were later recast formally as the four circles of catuskoti: \\"A\\", \\"not A\\", \\"A and not A\\", and \\"not A and not not A\\".S.

These eight arrays may be plotted as coordinates on a multidimensional field which may be rendered as a sphere, a mandala, a multidimensional shunya or zero where shunyata denotes zero-ness. The eight arrays are in a concordant relationship where they each constitute a chord to the sphere. The coordinates are equidistant from the epicentre of shunya where the array of the positive configuration (or hemisphere) and the array of the negative configuration (or hemisphere) constitute two polar radii or diametrical complements, a diameter in sum.

Robinson (1957: p. 294) qualifies the import of Nagarjuna's work (which includes Nagarjuna's application of the Catuskoti) due to the embedded noise in the scholarly lineage: \\"Certainly some of Nagarjuna's ancient opponents were just as confused as his modern interpreters...\\". This noise may also have co-arisen with Nagarjuna, following the work of Jayatilleke (1967). Modern interpretations Robinson (1957: p. 294)Robinson, Richard H. (1957).

Leningrad: Publishing Office of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR. opened a productive period in Madhyamaka studies. Schayer (1933) made a departure into the rules of inference employed by early Buddhist dialecticians and examines the Catuskoti (Tetralemma) as an attribute of propositional logic and critiques Stcherbatsky. Robinson (1957: p. 294) states that \\"Schayers criticisms of Stcherbatsky are incisive and just.\\" Murti (1955)Murti, T. R. V., 1955. The Central Philosophy of Buddhism. George Allen and Unwin, London. 2nd edition: 1960. makes no mention of the logical contribution of Schayer. According to Robinson (1957: p. 294), Murti furthered the work of Stcherbatsky amongst others, and brought what Robinson terms \\"the metaphysical phase of investigation\\" to its apogee though qualifies this with: \\"Murti has a lot to say about 'dialectic,' but practically nothing to say about formal logic.\\" Robinson (1957: p. 294) opines that Nakamura (1954),Nakamura, Hajime (1954). \\"Kukao no kigo-ronrigaku-teki ketsumei, (English: 'Some Clarifications of the Concept of Voidness from the Standpoint of Symbolic Logic')\\" Indogaku-bukkyogaku Kenkyu, No. 5, Sept., 1954, pp. 219-231. developed Schayer's methodology and defended and progressed its application. Robinson (1957: p. 293) opines that the 'metaphysical approach' evident foremost in Murti (1955) was not founded in a firm understanding of the 'logical structure of the system', i.e. catuskoti, for example: > Several fundamental limitations of the metaphysical approach are now > apparent.

Wayman (1977) holds that the Catu·π£ko·π≠i may be applied in suite, that is all are applicable to a given topic forming a paradoxical matrix; or they may be applied like trains running on tracks (or employing another metaphor, four mercury switches where only certain functions or switches are employed at particular times). This difference in particular establishes a distinction with the Greek tradition of the Tetralemma. Also, predicate logic has been applied to the Dharmic Tradition, and though this in some quarters has established interesting correlates and extension of the logico-mathematical traditions of the Greeks, it has also obscured the logico- grammatical traditions of the Dharmic Traditions of Catu·π£ko·π≠i within modern English discourse.

(1988, 2005: pp. 43‚Äì44), in the initially groundbreaking work on Zen which is now for the most part dated due to progress in scholarship (though still useful as the premier English work of comprehensive overview), model a particular formulation of the Catu·π£ko·π≠i that approaches the Caturanta engaging the Buddhist technical term 'dharmas' and attribute the model to Nagarjuna: > If we focus on the doctrinal agreement that exists between the Wisdom > S≈´tras'Wisdom S≈´tras' is a gloss of Praj√±ƒÅpƒÅramitƒÅ S≈´tras. and the tracts of > the MƒÅdhyamika we note that both schools characteristically practice a > didactic negation. By setting up a series of self-contradictory oppositions, > NƒÅgƒÅrjuna disproves all conceivable statements, which can be reduced to > these four: :All things (dharmas) exist: affirmation of being, negation of > nonbeing :All things (dharmas) do not exist: affirmation of nonbeing, > negation of being :All things (dharmas) both exist and do not exist: both > affirmation and negation :All things (dharmas) neither exist nor do not > exist: neither affirmation nor negation With the aid of these four > alternatives (catu·π£ko·π≠ika: affirmation, negation, double affirmation, double > negation), NƒÅgƒÅrjuna rejects all firm standpoints and traces a middle path > between being and nonbeing. Most likely the eight negations, arranged in > couplets in Chinese, can be traced back to NƒÅgƒÅrjuna: neither destruction > nor production, neither annihilation nor permanence, neither unity nor > difference, neither coming nor going.Dumoulin, Heinrich (author); Heisig, > James W.

Bloomington, Indiana, USA: World Wisdom, Inc. , pp.43-44 =Alternate Four Limits/Four Extremes= A Mantrayana enumeration of the Four Limits or the Four Extremes within the Buddhadharma is also common. These four 'limits' are evident in the earliest sutras of the Theravadin of the First Turning, through the Second Turning philosophy of Nagarjuna and his disciples and commentators and also evident in the Third Turning as evidenced in the presentation of Padmasambhava. Padmasambhava in his 'Secret Instruction in a Garland of Vision' lists them as follows with the English rendering following Dowman (2003)Dowman, Keith (2003, revised). The Flight of the Garuda: the Dzogchen Tradition of Tibetan Buddhism. Somerville, MA, USA: Wisdom Publications. , p.146 and Wylie following Norbu et al. (2001):Norbu, Namkhai (2001). The Precious Vase: Instructions on the Base of Santi Maha Sangha. Shang Shung Edizioni. Second revised edition. p. 103. (Translated from the Tibetan, edited and annotated by Adriano Clemente with the help of the author. Translated from Italian into English by Andy Lukianowicz.). This is a restricted text. *the 'Hedonist' or 'Chalpas' : does not perceive, ascribe to the view or realize that all events, dharmas, etc. have a cause and an effect; *the 'Atheist' or 'Gyangphenpas' : unable to see or perceive past and future lives, the atheist toils for wealth and power in this lifetime alone. They engage in intrigue; *the 'Nihilist' or 'Murthugpas' : holds that there is no causality or causal relationship between events and dharmas. They are of the view that everything is adventitiously arisen due to chance and events and that dharmas dissipate and vanish into the void. Death is the ultimate cessation and there is no continuity between lives; and *the 'Eternalist' or 'Mutegpas' : holds to the view of an eternal, unchanging 'atman', where atman is often rendered as 'soul' in English. There is considerable diversity of the mechanics of causality with proponents of this view. Some perceive the atman as having a cause but not effect, an effect but no cause, or indeed a complex causality or causal relationship. Each one of these extreme views, limits and binds the open, unbounded spaciousness of the natural mind. =Lexicon: technical language and terminology= Within English Buddhist logico- epistemological discourse, there is and has been historically, much obstruction to an understanding of the Caturanta (as the Catu·π£ko·π≠i) due to inherent negligence in terminology not being clearly defined from the outset. That said, acquisition of terminology must be engaged and actualized though the sadhana of the 'm≈´la praj√±ƒÅ', as definitions are slippery and challenging to pinpoint that hold for all contexts. Language usage in Buddhist logic is not intuitive but technical and must be learnt, acquired through the perfection and power of 'diligence' (Sanskrit: vƒ´rya). The following quotations are cited to provide insight (in lieu of technical definitions) into the understanding of the technical Buddhist terms 'existence', 'nature', 'being', 'entity' and 'svabhava' which are all mutually qualifying. Robinson (1957: p. 297) renders M≈´lamadhyamakakƒÅrikƒÅ 21.14, thus: > \\"He who posits an entity becomes entangled in eternalism and annihilism, > since that entity has to be either permanent or impermanent.\\"Robinson, > Richard H. (1957). 'Some Logical Aspects of Nagarjuna's System'. Philosophy > East & West. Volume 6, no. 4 (October 1957). University of Hawaii Press. > Source: (accessed: Saturday March 21, 2009), p.297 Robinson (1957: p. 300) in discussing the Buddhist logic of Nagarjuna, frames a view of 'svabhava': > Svabhava is by defini[t]ion the subject of contradictory ascriptions. If it > exists, it must belong to an existent entity, which means that it must be > conditioned, dependent on other entities, and possessed of causes. But a > svabhava is by definition unconditioned, not dependent on other entities, > and not caused. Thus the existence of a svabhava is impossible.

Y Karunadasa (1999, 2000: p. 1) holds that Early Buddhism and early Buddhist discourse \\"often refer to the mutual opposition between two views\\": *'permanence' or 'eternalism' (Pali: sassatavada) also sometimes referred to as 'the belief in being' (Pali: bhava-ditti); and *'annihilation' or 'nihilism' (Pali: ucchadevada) also sometimes referred to as 'the belief in non-being' (Pali: vibhava-ditti).Y Karunadasa (1999, 2000). \\"The Buddhist Critique of Sassatavada and Ucchedavada: The Key to a proper Understanding of the Origin and the Doctrines of early Buddhism.\\" from: Y Karunadasa (1999, 2000).

This detachment was discontinued on 7 July 2015. It provided telemetry and radar tracking data to support space launches out of the Eastern Range. When not supporting space launches, it provided radar tracking data for locating and cataloging space objects in support of U.S. Space Command's Space Surveillance Network. Operated as part of the space tracking mission for approximately 50 years, and required over per year operational cost in it later years. * Detachment 2, Ascension Auxiliary Air Field. This detachment provides telemetry and radar tracking data to support space launches out of the Eastern Range. When not supporting its primary mission, the unit has the secondary mission of providing radar tracking data for locating and cataloging space objects in support of the United States Space Command Space Surveillance Network. * Detachment 3, Patrick Air Force Base. This detachment, also known as the Guardian Angels,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhrkdHshb3E coordinates DOD contingency support for United States human space flight programs. Its roots go back to the 1959 charter by the Secretary of Defense as the DOD Mercury Support Office. Later renamed DOD Manned Space Flight Support Office. Since its inception the office has continued to be the principle facilitator for all DOD contingency support to Projects Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo; the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project; the Space Shuttle Program, the International Space Station/Soyuz Program; the Orion Program; and the presidential commercial space initiative. HistoryWorld War II= The group was organized at Army Air Base, Savannah, Georgia in January 1941 as the 45th Bombardment Group and equipped with Douglas A-20 Havocs (along with a few DB-7s, an export version of the A-20).The United States impounded 356 DB-7s ordered for France or Great Britain Its original assigned squadrons were the 78th, 79th and 80th Bombardment Squadrons. The 17th Reconnaissance Squadron was attached to the group. In June the group moved to Army Air Base, Manchester, New Hampshire, where the 17th Reconnaissance Squadron was assigned to the group as the 92d Bombardment Squadron.Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 781‚Äì782Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 776Maurer, Combat Squadrons, p. 775Maurer, Combat Squadrons, pp. 789‚Äì790 Douglas B-18B equipped for antisubmarine warfare Following the attack on Pearl Harbor the squadron began flying antisubmarine patrols off the Atlantic coast. In 1942, it converted to various medium bombers, primarily the Douglas B-18 Bolo, which was equipped with radar for the antisubmarine mission. The group moved to Dover Army Air Field, Delaware in May 1942 and to Miami Army Air Field, Florida in August. Its squadrons were dispersed to various bases along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts In October 1942, the Army Air Forces organized its antisubmarine forces into the single Army Air Forces Antisubmarine Command, which established the 26th Antisubmarine Wing the following month to control its forces operating over the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea.Maurer, Combat Units, p. 437Maurer, Combat Units, p. 389 The command's bombardment group headquarters, including the 45th, were inactivated and the squadrons, now designated the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th Antisubmarine Squadrons, were assigned directly to the 26th Wing. =Space operations= : See 45th Space Wing and 45th Launch Group for related lineage and history information Reactivated as the 45th Operations Group in November 1991 under Air Force Space Command. Operated \\"Down-Range\\" facilities at Antigua, Ascension Island, and Cape Canaveral, Florida; launched DOD payloads into orbit; and collected flight data for evaluation of ballistic missile systems launched from Eastern Launch sites for DOD, NASA, and commercial customers. Provided support for DOD, NASA, and commercial manned and unmanned space programs. There were several organizational changes in the wing in 1997 and 1998. Detachments 1 and 2 of the 45th Operations Group were inactivated on Antigua and Ascension on 1 June 1997, but they were replaced by Detachments 1 and 2 of the 45th Logistics Group on the same day. The 5th Space Launch Squadron was inactivated at Cape Canaveral Air Station on 29 June 1998, and its resources were absorbed by the 3rd Space Launch Squadron. Launch operations were reassigned to the 45th Launch Group on 1 December 2003.

One version of the poem tells how one day at day break as Yeo Ok's husband, Gwak Rijago (ÂõçÈáåÂ≠êÈ´ò), was rowing across a river, he saw an old mad man jump into river and try to swim across it. His wife had tried and failed to prevent him from entering the water. He was swept away and drowned. The old lady stricken with grief followed her husband into the water singing and playing her lyre and met the same sad fate as her husband. Gwak Rijago told his wife Yeo Ok about the sad event and this moved her to set the old lady's words to music. Yeo Ok's poem was then written to be sung accompanied by a lyre (called a gong-in). The first record of this poem is in Hanja but authorities are uncertain as to whether it was originally written in Hanja characters or first composed in Korean and then later translated. The \\"Gonghuin\\" was widely sung by Koreans at the time. Furthermore, it was introduced to Chinese Jin dynasty and later China's most famous poet, Li Po, composed a poem with \\"Gonghuin\\" as the subject. It has been claimed that the popularity of the poem is due to its portrayal of the dignity and love amongst the poor and the pain and loneliness of the woman who had lost love. All those involved are from the suffering, low or slave, classes whose lives then were so hard in society where only the privileged could live well.

It was founded by two Yale classmates (class of 1933), Malcolm P. Taylor (1911-2000) and Charles M. D. Reed (1911-2008), who had worked together on the campus humor magazine The Yale Record.Yale Banner & Pot Pourri. New Haven: Yale University Press. 1932. p. 182. Initially headquartered near Taylor's home in Mamaroneck, New York, the company soon moved operations a few miles away to Crescent Street in Glenbrook, Connecticut, a light-industrial and residential section of Stamford in Fairfield County, Connecticut. Taylor-Reed specialized in a handful of consumer snack products, notably Cocoa Marsh which they called a \\"milk amplifier\\" or \\"milk booster\\" and E-Z Pop popcorn. It also manufactured Q-T Instant cake frosting and a variety of bulk institutional foods.Obituaries for Taylor and Reed  Cocoa Marsh  During its early years, Taylor-Reed's main line of business was packaging sugar and chocolate rations for the War Department. In the postwar years, the company's best-known product was Cocoa Marsh chocolate syrup, which advertised heavily on children's programming in the New York City television market during the 1950s and 1960s.Much more background information in this online discussion board For many years the Taylor-Reed plant, with its Cocoa Marsh billboard (\\"Be strong as a lion!\\") was a familiar landmark by the Glenbrook station on the New Haven Railroad. The company would on occasion issue jars of Cocoa Marsh with a toy surprise hidden in a double top. The regular metal jar cover had an additional white top cover approx. 3/4\\" tall attached with a white plastic strip. The toy surprise was located in this top cover. Other jars came with the pump cover - which could be re-used on a \\"refill\\" jar or the jar with the toy, also a re-fill jar. After partners Taylor and Reed retired from day-to-day business (about 1970) the company gradually ceased operations as a food manufacturer and began to rent out and finally sell its premises. The factory's main driveway off Crescent Street is now officially designated Taylor Reed Place.  E-Z Pop Patent Infringement Case  E-Z Pop commercial from the 1950s In 1963 E-Z Pop figured in a landmark patent-infringement case, with Taylor-Reed as the plaintiff and Mennen Food Products, manufacturer of Jiffy Pop, as the defendant. Taylor-Reed had acquired the patent rights to E-Z Pop popcorn in 1954.Popped Culture: A Social History of Popcorn in America by Andrew F. Smith, 1999. Also see Better Than Homemade, by Carolyn Wyman, 2004. The U.S. Court of Appeals, Seventh Circuit, struck down a lower-court ruling that Jiffy Pop's packaging, in particular its expanding-foil pouch, was equivalent to E-Z Pop's. The Appellate Court found that Jiffy Pop's aluminum foil was compressed in a spiral arrangement and this was a significant improvement on E-Z Pop's \\"button\\" compression.Docket number No. 14143, The TAYLOR-REED CORPORATION, Plaintiff-Appellee, v.

With one non-movable sectionBar= A bar (also known as a slab, block, candybar) phone takes the shape of a cuboid, usually with rounded corners and/or edges. The name is derived from the rough resemblance to a chocolate bar in size and shape. This form factor is widely used by a variety of manufacturers, such as Nokia and Sony Ericsson. Bar-type smartphones commonly have the screen and keypad on a single face. Sony had a well-known 'Mars Bar' phone model CM-H333 in 1993. Keyboard bars These are variants of bars that have a full QWERTY keyboard on the front. While they are technically the same as a regular bar phone, the keyboard and all the buttons make them look significantly different. Devices like these were popular in the mid- to late-2000s, but lost popularity afterwards. The BlackBerry line from Research In Motion (RIM) was particularly popular and influential in this category. =Brick= \\"Brick\\" is a slang term used to refer to large, outdated rectangular phones, typically early devices with large batteries and electronics. These early phones, such as the Motorola DynaTAC, have been displaced by newer smaller models which offer greater portability thanks to smaller antennas and slimmer battery packs. However, \\"brick\\" has more recently been applied to older phone models in general, including non-bar form factors (flip, slider, swivel, etc.), and even early touchscreen phones as well, due to their size and relative lack of functionality compared to current models on the market. The term \\"brick\\" has also expanded beyond smartphones to include most non-working consumer electronics, including a game console, router, or other device, that, due to a serious misconfiguration, corrupted firmware, or a hardware problem, can no longer function, hence, is as technologically useful as a brick. The term derives from the vaguely cuboid shape of many electronic devices (and their detachable power supplies) and the suggestion that the device can function only as a lifeless, square object, paperweight or doorstop. This term is commonly used as a verb. For example, \\"I bricked my MP3 player when I tried to modify its firmware.\\" It can also be used as a noun, for example, \\"If it's corrupted and you apply using fastboot, your device is a brick.\\" In the common usage of the term, \\"bricking\\" suggests that the damage is so serious as to have rendered the device permanently unusable. =Slate= A slate is a smartphone form with few to no physical buttons, instead relying upon a touchscreen and an onscreen virtual keyboard for input.The slate/touchscreen design does not having any fragile moving parts and is generally more compact than a slider form factor.PC Magazine: \\"Tablet Computer\\" definition The first commercially available touchscreen phone was a brick phone, the IBM Simon Personal Communicator, released in 1994. The iPhone, which was released by Apple in 2007, is largely responsible for the influence and achievement of this design as it is currently conceived. Some unusual \\"slate\\" designs include that of LG New Chocolate (BL40), or the Samsung Galaxy Round, which is curved. Phablet The phablet or smartlet is a subset of the slate/touchscreen. A portmanteau of the words phone and tablet, phablets are a class of mobile device designed to combine or straddle the size of a slate smartphone together with a tablet. Phablets typically have screens that measure (diagonally) greater than 5.3 inches, and are considerably larger than most high-end slate smartphones of the time (i.e. the Samsung Galaxy Note II smartlet versus the Samsung Galaxy SIII smartphone), which have to be 5.2 inches or less to be known as a smartphone, though significantly smaller than tablets (which must be 7 inches or above to be considered as such). Multi-screen The multi-screen is of basically the slate form factor, but with two touchscreens. Some have a small separate screen above the main screens, the LG V10 and LG V20. Other multi-screen form factors has screens on both sides of the phone. In the case of Yotaphone and Siam 7X, they have normal touchscreens on the front, but on the backside is an e-ink screen, which enables using the cases in a fashion similar to reading a book. The presence of the front camera for taking selfies has been an essential feature in smartphones, however, it is a difficulty to achieve a bezelless screen as is the trend in the later 2010s. The Nubia X, Nubia Z20 and Vivo NEX Dual Display have solved this combining the use of the main camera and a smaller second rear screen, eliminating the front camera.  Wrapped-around display  Xiaomi revealed Mi MIX Alpha, a smartphone with a display that surrounds almost entirely its body, only interrupted in the back part by a column that contains the cameras. Back part of display can be used as viewfinder for selfies and videocalls. =Taco= The taco form factor was popularized by the Nokia N-Gage, released in 2003. It was widely known as the plastic taco for its taco-shape and the placement of microphones on the side of the device, which, when one talks into the microphone, gives the appearance of eating a taco. Other models include Nokia 3300 and Nokia 5510. =Wearables=Smartwatch A smartphone in the form of a wristwatch is typically referred to as a smartwatch or watch phone. With movable sectionsFlip= A flip or clamshell phone consists of two or more sections that are connected by hinges, allowing the phone to flip open then fold closed in order to become more compact. When flipped open, the phone's screen and keyboard are available. When flipped shut, the phone becomes much smaller and more portable than when it is opened for use. Motorola was once owner of a trademark for the term flip phone,US trademark #2157939, cancelled 2005-02-26 but the term flip phone has become genericized and used more frequently than clamshell in colloquial speech. Motorola was the manufacturer of the famed StarTAC flip phone in the 1990s, as well as the RAZR in the mid-2000s. There were also flip \\"down\\" phones, like the Motorola MicroTAC series and was also widely used by Ericsson. In 2010, Motorola introduced a different kind of flip phone with its Backflip smartphone. When closed, one side is the screen and the other is a physical QWERTY keyboard. The hinge is on a long edge of the phone instead of a short edge, and when flipped out the screen is above the keyboard. Another unusual flip form was seen on the luxury Serene, a partnership between Samsung and Bang & Olufsen. Clamshell came to be used as generic for this form factor. Flip phone referred to phones that opened on the vertical axis. As clamshells disappeared from the market, the terms again became disambiguated. By the mid-2000s, \\"flip\\" designs reached the peak of their availability and declined afterwards, being replaced by sliders which in turn were completely replaced by slate smartphones. Dual-touchscreen In April 2011, Kyocera International released the Kyocera Echo smartphone with two 3.5\\" screens. The phone's primary display could lay on top of the second display, reducing its size.Kyocera Echo review. Engadget.com. Retrieved on 2013-12-09. In November 2017, ZTE announced the Axon M. The screens could fold to either have two forward facing screens, or one forward and one rear facing screen. The combined display size is 6.75-inch when unfolded. The second screen allows the Axon M's single camera to be both rear and forward facing, as well as acting as a kickstand or tripod. Foldable screen Due to advances in display technology, as of 2010s, OLED screens can be manufactured on a flexible, plastic substrate. Glass is no longer needed, allowing the displays to be rolled, bent and folded. This makes new form factors possible in mobile phones. In January 2017, rumours emerged of a Samsung foldable phone. In November 2018, it is revealed that the new phone‚ÄîSamsung Galaxy Fold'shttps://www.digitaltrends.com/mobile/samsung- galaxy-f-news/ combined display size is 7.4-inch. Other manufacturers, such as Huawei and Xiaomi have also announced phones with foldable displays. In November 2019, Motorola officially unveiled its horizontal-folding Motorola Razr.  Flip-up camera  Video demonstrating the retracting action of Asus ZenFone 6's flip camera The Oppo N1 made use of a manual flip camera. Asus, in the Zenfone 6 smartphone, includes an all-screen front, eliminating the dedicated front-facing selfie camera notch; instead, the main cameras are housed in a motorized flip-up module that rotates 180 degrees to focus forward. The Samsung Galaxy A80 also has a similar flip-slide camera mechanism. =Slider= A slider is composed of usually two, but sometimes more, sections that slide past each other on rails. Most slider phones have a display segment which houses the device's screen, while another segment contains the keypad or keyboard and slides out for use. The goal of a sliding form factor is to allow the operator to take advantage of full physical keyboards or keypads, without sacrificing portability, by retracting them into the phone when they are not in use. Many different companies have developed smartphones that slide: Samsung has the Corby and BlackBerry has the Torch. The Siemens SL10 was one of the first slider smartphones in 1999. Some phones have an automatic slider built in that deploys the keypad. Many phones pop out their keypad segments as soon as the user begins to slide the phone apart. Unique models are the 2-way slider where sliding up or down provides distinct functions: the Nokia N85 or Nokia N95 are examples of this. A version of the slider form factor, the side slider or QWERTY slider, uses vertical access of the keyboard on the bottom segment. The side slider form factor is primarily used to facilitate faster access to the keyboard with both thumbs. The Motorola Photon Q, Danger Hiptop, Sony Mylo, and HTC Touch Pro are four primary examples. Some unusual sliders have also been made, such as the Nokia 7280 modelled like a lipstick, Samsung SGH-F520 from 2007 which slides three ways with a QWERTY keyboard - in last mode qwerty keyboard is not visible but a keyboard for gaming or the Samsung Anycall SCH-B550 which is a gaming phone.https://www.fantv.nl/digitaal/gadgets/13526-samsung-anycall- sch-b550-gametelefoon Sliders supplanted the flip form, since they allowed manufacturers to pack more keypad buttons and features (especially the side slider or QWERTY slider) into the same form factor, while touchscreen interfaces were still in their infancy. By the late-2000s, \\"slider\\" designs reached the peak of their popularity and declined afterwards, being completely replaced by slate form factors with well-developed touch interfaces. In 2015, BlackBerry Limited (previously RIM) released the BlackBerry Priv, the first mainstream slider phone in several years (based on Android, not the Blackberry operating system they sold so far). Nokia E7, released in 2011 and F(x)tec Pro 1, released in 2019 are notable examples of smartphone sliders as they bring out the keyboard from the side and tilt the display so they reminisce a laptop.https://thenextweb.com/plugged/2019/09/05/the-fxtec-pro-1-proves- theres-room-for-keyboard-slider-phones-in-2019/ As 2018, manufacturers are trying to develop bezelless smartphones, being the greatest difficulty the presence of front cameras and face recognition sensors, while most brands expand display real state conserving a notch, some departs from that approach returning to the slider form factor, in models like Xiaomi Mi Mix 3, Huawei Honor Magic 2 and Lenovo Z5 Pro. Variation was kick-slider, slider with extra hinge to conform to face like on Motorola Rizr Z8.  Pop up camera  Phones like Oppo Find X and Vivo Nex hide front cameras within the body of the devices in motorized pop-up modules to create a bezelless front face fully occupied by screens without any cutout while keeping a front-facing camera that can up when required. Vivo V15 Pro and Centric S1 also come with pop up camera mechanism for selfie camera. =Swivel= A swivel phone is composed of multiple, usually two, segments, which swivel past each other about a sagital axis (most of the time). Use of the swiveling form factor has similar goals to that of the slider, but this form factor is less widely used. Samples are, LG U900 + 960 + V9000, Motorola Flipout + V70 + V80, Nokia 7370, Siemens SK65, Samsung Juke + Samsung SGH-X830, and Sony Ericsson S700i + W600. Some implementations, that do not use the sagital axis, are presenting in phones like Nokia 3250 and Oppo N1, with twistable componentes: a keyboard, and main camera (doubling as a selfie one), respectively. =Mixed= Some mobile phones use more than one form, such as the Nokia N90, Nokia 6260, Philips 968, Sharp SX862, Samsung SGH-P910, Samsung FlipShot SCH-U900, Amoi 2560, Samsung Alias series or Panasonic FOMA P900iV, which use both a swivel and a flip axis. Other examples include the Sierra Wireless Voq which combines a candybar with a keyboard \\"side-flip\\"; the Nokia Communicator series which utilise both a candybar and a clamshell with a QWERTY keyboard; or the Siemens SK65 which is a swivel candybar with a QWERTY keyboard. Bezelless Samsung A80 only has rear cameras that are housed in a motorized module, using a combination of slider and swivel they achieve the rotation to the front to be used for selfies.

It follows a Soviet football (soccer) team in a Western city where they come into contact with many politically incorrect bad characters such as the Diva, the Fascist, the Agent Provocateur, the Negro and others. The team falls victim to match rigging, police harassment, and unjust imprisonment by the evil bourgeoisie. The team is freed from jail when the local workers overthrow their capitalist overlords. The ballet ends with a dance of solidarity between the workers and the football team. Shostakovich himself was a very keen football follower, and is said to have coined the expression \\"Football is the ballet of the masses\\". Instrumentation Woodwinds: 2 flutes (2nd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes (2nd doubling cor anglais), 3 clarinets (2nd doubling Eb clarinet, 3rd doubling bass clarinet), 2 saxophones doubling on soprano and tenor, 2 bassoons (2nd doubling double bassoon). Brass: 4 French horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, euphonium, tuba. Percussion: timpani, triangle, woodblock, tambourine, flexatone, ratchet, snare drums, cymbals, bass drum, tam-tam, xylophone, bayan, harmonium. Strings: violins, violas, cellos, double basses, banjo. Suite Shostakovich extracted a suite from the ballet, Op. 22a, in four movements: #Introduction (Allegro non troppo) #Adagio #Polka (Allegretto) #Danse The Polka was reused as the second of his Two Pieces for String Quartet in 1931. He also arranged the Polka for solo piano (Op. 22b) and piano four hands (Op. 22c), in 1935 and 1962 respectively. Revivals In 1982, Yury Grigorovich and Isaak Glikman revived the ballet with a new libretto. Grigorovich also chose to integrate other works of Shostakovich into the score.Marina Ilichova, \\"Shostakovich's ballets\\" in The Cambridge Companion to Shostakovich, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008, p. 205. In 1983, he created The Golden Age for Irek Mukhamedov, who defined the role of Boris, the young workers' leader, for successive generations of Bolshoi dancers. They moved the action to the USSR in the 1920s to a restaurant called \\"The Golden Age\\". Conflict unfolded between the Soviet Komsomol and the gang. The premiere took place on 4 November 1982 in Moscow's Bolshoi Theatre. In 2006, the playwright Konstantin Uchitel wrote a new libretto for the same music. The action was set in our time. Old man and old woman meet and remember their youth. The premiere took place on 28 June 2006 at the Mariinsky Theatre.

It was the 2005 CBCA Book of the Year for Older Readers, and also won the Courier Mail 2005 People's Choice Award for Younger Readers.The Running Man at the Australian Literacy Educators' Association  Plot summary  Joseph Davidson was a quiet, self-conscious fourteen-year-old boy and a talented artist. His world changes, however, when he is asked to draw a portrait of his mysterious neighbour Tom Leyton who was a Vietnam veteran who for thirty years has lived alone with his sister Caroline, raising his silkworms and hiding from prying eyes. Because of this he is the subject of ugly gossip and rumour, much of it led by neighbour Mrs. Mossop, who views Leyton‚Äôs brief teaching career with suspicion. When Joseph finally meets his reclusive neighbour he discovers a cold, brooding man lost deep within his own cocoon of silence. He soon realises that in order to truly draw Tom Leyton, he must find the courage to unlock the man‚Äôs dark and perhaps dangerous secrets. But Joseph has his own secrets, including the pain of his damaged relationship with his absent father and his childhood fear of the Running Man ‚Äì a local character whose wild appearance and strange manner of moving everywhere at a frantic pace terrified him when he was a small boy. These dreams suddenly return when Joseph is forced to face his fears and doubts regarding Tom Leyton. As Joseph moves deeper and deeper into his neighbour‚Äôs world he confronts not only Tom Leyton‚Äôs private hell, but also his own relationship with his father, and ultimately the dishevelled, lurching figure of the Running Man.

Biography Krafft was born in Stockholm, Sweden. He was the son of portraitist Per Krafft the Elder (1724‚Äì1793) and Maria Vilhelmina Ekebom (1749-1820) as well as the brother of portrait miniaturist Wilhelmina Krafft (1778‚Äì1828). While still only a child of six, he began his studies at the Royal Swedish Academy of Fine Arts (1783-1796). He received his first medal in 1787. He studied there until 1796; notably with Lorens Pasch the Younger (1733‚Äì1805). At age 18, he was honored with a commission for a portrait of the powerful French politician, Francois-Emmanuel Guignard de Saint-Priest. Shortly after, under the influence of Louis Masreliez (1748‚Äì1810), he went to Paris, where he became a student of Neoclassical painter Jacques-Louis David (1748‚Äì1825). In 1801, for a major Academy exhibition in Stockholm, Krafft sent home three works: Belisarius, a smiling Cupid, and Paris as a shepherd; all composed in neoclassical style. In 1802 he traveled to Italy, where he drew cityscapes, studied the Old Masters and made copies of Raphael. In May 1803 he returned from Florence to Paris, where he became a highly sought-after portrait painter. In 1805, he returned to Stockholm, where he had received an appointment as a court painter. In 1808, he was chosen as a Deputy Professor at the Academy and, following the death of Carl Frederik von Breda in 1818, was promoted to a full Professor of Drawing; a position he held until 1856 During his career, Krafft painted over 400 portraits, including 60 drawings, and hundreds of other works. In addition, Krafft has painted about 100 paintings with biblical, historical and other motifs. Personal life He married Brita Sofia Robsahm (1784‚Äì1854). He died during 1863 in Stockholm.

He was the father of the artists Per Krafft the Younger and Wilhelmina Krafft. Early life Per Krafft studied in Uppsala, where he in 1736 became interested in the arts. From 1739 he was for several years a student of portrait painter Johan Henrik Scheffel in Stockholm . His self- portrait from 1745 and a portrait of his sister Anna Lisa (married Askblom ) shows clear influences from Scheffel. In 1745 Krafft went to Copenhagen, where he came under Carl Gustaf Pilo's influence, as seen in the 1748 autographed portraits of Anna Bohr and a Miss Leijonhufvud as a shepherdess. In 1749, Per Krafft went to Sk√•ne and painted Governor Wilhelm Lindenstedts portrait in baroque style. Krafft had a patron in Denmark then Finance Minister Otto Thott, to whom he copied several hundred family portraits at various Danish castle, which was collected in Gavn√∏. In 1752 Krafft painted the Count and Countess Thotts and their daughter's portrait, later kept on in Gavn√∏ and Frederiksborg Castle. Portrait of Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski by Per Krafft the Elder, National Museum, Warsaw, 1767 Travel In 1755 he traveled to Paris, where he became a student of Chardin. He later became a student of Alexander Roslin, a professor at Bayreuth and court painter to Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski of Poland. Krafft painted in Paris included Count Nils Nilsson Bonde and some genre portraits, for example a Young Girl who Plays Lira (1758). In such images, he followed Jean-Baptiste Greuze's style, which was in vogue at the time. In 1762 Krafft was appointed as professor at the Margrave of Bayreuth's Academy of Art. Here he performed a brilliant portrait of the Duchess of W√ºrttemberg Margravine Elisabeth Fredericka Sophie of Brandenburg-Bayreuth, and a portrait of the Margravine's friend, the ambassador, Count Fr. Ellrodt. Margrave Frederick's death dissolved the academy and the artists dispersed. Krafft then went to Italy, where he visited Bologna and Florence. After a new subsistence in Bayreuth, where Krafft again portrayed the Duchess of Wurttemberg, he went to Dresden, where he portrayed the minister, Baron von Fritsch. For the Polish king, Stanis≈Çaw August Poniatowski, Krafft was called to Warsaw, where he painted in 1767‚Äì68 a pictor regius with a variety of portraits for the Polish court. Return to Sweden Portrait of Gustave III of Sweden, 1786 In 1768 Krafft returned to Stockholm after 21 years abroad. Pastel were now out of style, and oil paintings again in vogue. Before the portrait orders increased, Krafft undertook other assignments. In 1770, he painted an altarpiece for Musk√∂ chapel. In competition with Lorens Pasch the Younger who painted the court and nobility, Krafft mostly painted the local bourgeois and scholars. He did portraits of Carl Christoffer Gj√∂rwell Sr., Niclas Sahlgren, Emanuel Swedenborg, Sven Lagerbring, Carl Michael Bellman, Carl Linnaeus, Jonas Alstr√∂mer and peasantry President Anders Mattsson. At Uppsala University Krafft performed a couple of chancellor portraits, including King Adolf Frederick and King Gustavus III as Crown Prince. Later, he received more orders of King Gustaf III and his queen, and received the title of Professor in 1773 and was elected to the painting academy. At the Academy Krafft painted his self-portrait around 1775. Per Krafft painted also Gustaf IV Adolf as a child and at 15 years of age, and portrayed Gustaf Philip Creutz and Elis Schr√∂derheim and Anna Charlotta von Stapelmohr. Sk√•ne castle hosts several portraits done by Krafft. Among his main works from later years include a full-length portrait of Georg Potocki, and several portraits for the family of his wife and children. His children have been painted by Krafft several times, sometimes both together. He was the father of the painters Per Krafft the Younger and Wilhelmina Krafft.

He was the father of the \\"uncrowned\\" Emperor Iyasu V. He changed his name to Mikael upon converting to Christianity.  Life  Imam Mohammed Ali, was a ruler of Wollo and was a member of the Mammadoch ruling dynasty of Wollo. His father was Ras Ali , and his mother was Woizero Getie. In the infamous Council of Boru Meda, Emperor Yohannes (formerly Kassa Mercha, a ruler from Tigray) forced Mohammed Ali and Muslims holding office in Wollo to convert to Christianity within three months or renounce their positions. \\"Having concluded that Wollo was worth a mass,\\" Marcus claims, \\"Mohammad Ali led his people to Christianity.\\" Nevertheless, while some of the leaders of Wollo converted to Christianity, the vast majority of the Muslim populace of Wollo refused to convert. As a consequence, Atse Yohanne massacarred thousands of Wollo Muslims at Boru Media for refusing to convert to Christianity. Mohammed Ali was baptized with the name \\"Mikael\\" and became a Ras (equivalent to \\"Duke\\"). Many Muslims from Wollo left for sanctuary in Metemma, Jimma, and Harar.Marcus, Menelik II, p. 58 Emperor Yohannes IV stood as his godfather at his baptism. Ras Mikael of Wollo, as he was now known, eventually would marry Shoaregga Menelik, Menelik's natural daughter, becoming the third of his four wives. Mikael founded Dessie, the first town in Wollo and its new capital. It is claimed that Ras Mikael became a deeply devout Orthodox Christian, and a dedicated builder of churches. In 1896, during the First Italo-Ethiopian War, Ras Mikael fought with Menelik and led the feared cavalry against the invading Italians at the Battle of Adwa. An Italian brigade began a fighting retreat towards the main Italian positions. However, the brigade inadvertently marched into a narrow valley where Mikael's cavalry slaughtered them while shouting \\"Reap! Reap!\\" . The remains of the brigade's commander were never found.George Fitz- Hardinge Berkeley, Campaign of Adowa (1902), quoted in Lewis, Fashoda, p. 118. Following Menelik's death in 1913, Mikael's son and Emperor Menelik's grandson, Lij Iyasu, ascended as Iyasu V. Per Menelik's wishes, Ras Tessema Nadew became the Regent for Menelik's 18-year-old grandson. However, that same year, Tessema Nadew died. While Iyasu was now on his own, he was never fully accepted. More importantly, he was never formally crowned Emperor. However, on the instructions of Iyasu, his father Mikael was anointed Negus or king or Wollo and Tigray. Negus Mikael then became the power behind the throne.Mockler, Haile Sellassie's War (New York: Olive Branch Press, 2002), p. 385 During World War I, concerns arose over Iyasu's ties to the Central Powers, over his possible support for Mohammed Abdullah Hassan, and over his potential conversion to Islam. In response to these concerns, on 27 September 1916, Iyasu was deposed by a council of nobles and high clergy, and Mikael's sister-in-law, Woizero Zewditu, was pronounced Negiste Negest (\\"Queen of Kings\\") Zewditu I. Zewditu was another of Menelik's daughters, and at the same time that she was made Empress, the council also proclaimed as Regent and Heir to the Throne, young Ras Tafari Makonnen, the future Emperor Haile Selassie I. The new Regent and Heir Ras Tafari was married to Woizero (later Empress) Menen Asfaw, a granddaughter of Negus Mikael by his daughter Woizero Sehin Mikael. Negus Mikael's response to Iyasu being deposed was swift. On 7 October, Mikael set out from Wollo at the head of an army of 80,000 men to invade Shewa and to reinstate his son; Iyasu would join him there with an army of his own. On 27 October, Negus Mikael confronted the main body of the forces supporting Zewditu in the Battle of Segale. Mikael attacked first, but ammunition for his machine guns ran out early and his artillery was silenced quickly. His infantry and cavalry assaults ran directly into the murderous fire of an enemy ready for his attacks.Gebre-Igziabiher Elyas, Prowess, Piety, and Politics: The Chronicle of Abeto Iyasu and Empress Zewditu of Ethiopia (1909-1930), translated by Edward Molvaer (K√∂ln: R√ºdiger K√∂ppe, 1994), pp. 372-375 Iyasu was detoured on his way to the battlefield and arrived too late to help. He was only able to see that his father was defeated, and fled the battlefield and went into hiding.Harold G.

After two and a half years, Mikael successfully petitioned to Empress Zewditu to be moved from the island, and he was put under house arrest at Holeta Genet at a former country home of the late Emperor Menelik II, where he died six months later.Gebre-Igzabiher Elyas, Chronicle, pp. 400f As the grandfather of the wife of the Crown Prince, the court went into full mourning for Negus Mikael.

In the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) station database (CDBS), broadcast STA applications have a prefix of BSTA (general), BLSTA (legal), BESTA (engineering), or BLESTA (both). STAs can also be issued for other telecommunication services under FCC regulation. Often an STA is necessary due to an unforeseen event. A station operator must exhibit why the STA is necessary and serves the public good. A common reason to apply for STA is an equipment failure. In case a station cannot use its licensed antenna or transmission system, it can immediately continue operations using any available antenna or operating parts of existing system, as long as an STA is filed for within 24 hours. An AM station may use a random wire antenna if necessary. AM stations operating directionally are limited to 25 percent of their licensed power if their directional array fails and they must operate non-directionally under STA. If a station is evicted from its transmitter site or must move for another reason, it may also continue operating from a temporary site under the same rules, as long as it does not change or increase its coverage area or plan to permanently broadcast from that site. These rules allow stations to resume broadcasting quickly in case of a state of disaster. A station may go silent entirely for up to ten days without notifying the FCC at all, and up to thirty days with only a letter of notification. A station that is or will be silent for longer than thirty days must apply for a \\"silent STA\\", which can be granted for up to six months. The FCC typically required that silence be for reasons beyond the operator's control, such as total equipment failure or loss of programming, and asked for plans to return the station to air. The commission has since started to grant silent STAs for financial reasons. Stations that are silent can also apply for an operational STA to resume broadcasting from a temporary facility, to avoid losing its license after one continuous year of silence. The one-year limit was written into the Telecommunications Act of 1996 and cannot be overridden by the FCC due to extenuating circumstances. This silent/operational STA process presents a loophole in that it can be used to work around the Telecommunications Act indefinitely, and such STAs are normally granted with little oversight. In January 2018, the FCC initiated a crackdown on stations that exploit the loophole. The first high-profile case was co-owned stations WBVA in Bayside, Virginia and WVAB in Virginia Beach, Virginia, whose 2017 license renewals were designated for a hearing. The stations have operated under a cycle of silent and operational STAs since 2008; they applied yearly to broadcast with 30 and 6 watts, respectively, from a temporary site for several weeks before going silent for the rest of the year. Station owner Birach Broadcasting Corporation has claimed it is stuck with the temporary facilities as it has been unable to get zoning approval for a new transmitter site. An STA can also be used for special events as a Restricted Service Licence is in the U.K., however this is rare. A market has developed around proprietary devices that provide live audio or video to attendees of a conference or sporting event; these devices receive a signal from a low-powered television station operating under a temporary STA in VHF Band I, which is largely no longer used for broadcasting.

The Pacific Crest Trail traverses the area between Carson Pass and Echo Summit. =Hawley Grade= This trail began as an immigrant wagon road, the first road built across the central Sierra mountains. Asa Hawley, in the spring of 1854, established a trading post in Lake Valley near the Upper Truckee River's canyon wall that became known as Hawley's Hill. Construction began for a wagon road as the grade was gentle enough to safely travel, unlike the existing Carson Grade, where block and tackle had to be used to get the wagons over into Lake Valley. The new route was completed in 1857 and further improvements were done by El Dorado and Sacramento counties. Hawley's Grade was, for a short time, the route to take. Built to convey miners and the like to the Mother Lode country, the Hawley Grade was a reverse route as well when the 1859 discovery of silver happened in Nevada territory. As the Hawley Grade's purpose was to bypass the steeper road, so the Hawley Grade was itself bypassed in favor of an even shorter path, the wagon-and-stage toll road down Meyers Grade (today's highway 50), completed in 1860.Schaffer, Jeffrey p> p 317 A portion of the old road, now a hiking trail, can be hiked all the way to State highway 50, one and one-half miles, with an elevation gain of less than .

It is named after England, the common name in Scandinavia of the United Kingdom, which declared war on Denmark-Norway due to disagreements over the neutrality of Danish trade and to prevent the Danish fleet falling into the hands of the First French Empire. It began with the first battle of Copenhagen in 1801 and its latter stage from 1807 onwards was followed by the Gunboat War, the Dano- Swedish War of 1808‚Äì09 and the Swedish invasion of Holstein in 1814. Prelude After the death of Denmark-Norway's foreign minister Andreas Peter Bernstorff in 1800, crown prince Frederick began exerting his will in all areas. This meant that the finance minister Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann ignored protests from the foreign minister Christian Bernstoff to finally grant the Dutch-born merchant Fr√©d√©ric de Coninck's repeated requests for a naval convoy to accompany 40 merchantmen. This convoy transported mainly French and Dutch products from the Dutch East Indies to Copenhagen. This led to an 'armed neutrality' and though it gave mixed signals to the rest of the world as to that neutrality Denmark-Norway continued to insist on the inviolability of ships sailing under neutral flags. Several other such convoys set out the following day and these were given orders to resist if foreign naval ships attempted to examine the papers or cargoes in ships under the Danish flag, whatever the size of the force the convoy was faced with. This was a high-risk strategy since many non-Danish ships were sailing under the Danish flag to gain their neutrality benefits, and though the policy proved profitable in its first year it also drew diplomatic protests from the United Kingdom. In December 1799 an English sailor attempting to check a Danish- flagged ship at Gibraltar was killed. When in 1800 it appeared that Russia would head a new League of Armed Neutrality Great Britain reacted, in summer that year having a squadron of 130 guns try to board a Danish convoy escorted by the 40-gun frigate Freya at Ostend. In accordance with his orders the captain of the Freya refused and gave battle, but was forced to strike its flag after an hour. This led to Denmark-Norway asking Russia to join the Armed Neutrality, though in August a British fleet arrived off Copenhagen. Under threat of a British bombardment Christian Bernstorff promised to stop convoys temporarily while Denmark and the United Kingdom set up common rules on how and when convoys were to be used. The following month a Russian ambassador arrived in Denmark with a formal invitation for the country to join the League of Armed Neutrality together with Sweden, Russia and Prussia (headed by tsar Paul I of Russia) which it did in December 1800. However, in 1801 the Tsar signed an alliance with France, and Russia and France then forced through the closure of all European ports to British trade, leading the United Kingdom to demand that Denmark-Norway immediately leave the League. However, such a departure would make Denmark-Norway appear to ally itself with the United Kingdom and thus almost certainly lead to its being invaded by one of France or Russia's allies (Sweden had an eye to gaining Norway from Denmark and, if Prussia could conquer Jutland at the same time, British access to the Baltic Sea could be completely cut off). Denmark-Norway thus chose the lesser of two evils and refused all British proposals for negotiations. The United Kingdom thus sent a fleet against Denmark on 12 March 1801 to remove Denmark-Norway from the League by force. CourseCopenhagen (1801)= The Danish ships of the line, Kronborg and Dannebrog, in battle. The Danes had begun to prepare for a possible attack from the British, but much of the fleet was, in late March, not ready after the winter and would take up to six weeks to make it ready. So the Danish defense plan was that the ships available should protect the entrance to Copenhagen by lying anchored in the curved line from Trekroner Fort to Amager. Command was given to Olfert Fischer, who placed himself in the middle of the formation, with his ship Dannebrog. Crew was lacking on various ships so additional crew was acquired by offering 15 \\"riksdaler\\" in wages, followed by a quick training in how to use a cannon and message to fight bravely for the king and country. The British fleet passed Kronborg unimpeded on 30 March and continued towards Copenhagen along the Swedish coast. Crown Prince Frederick had, out of fear that the Swedes would be exempted from the Sound Dues, said no to help from them in the battle. The Swedish fleet was still, at the initiative of Gustav IV Adolf, on their way to help the Danes, but was impeded bad weather.Lindqvist, pp. 190-191 By midday the British fleet had anchored at Taarb√¶k reef. Admiral Sir Hyde Parker's plan was that half of his fleet would attack the Danish fleet from the south, while the rest would attack the Danish blockade in Kronl√∏bet. The attack was then to be terminated by an attack on the island of Trekroner. In the following days the British prepared to attack, and they sailed further south, past Copenhagen, to avoid the Danish land batteries Sixtus, Quintus and Trekroner.Feldb√¶k, pp. 98-133 Lord Horatio Nelson had been given command of twelve of the British liners, and had the task of getting them through the tight defense that surrounded Copenhagen's reef, which was already extremely difficult to navigate through. He nevertheless took the initiative to attack, and four of his largest ships (Elephant, Defiance, Russel and Bellona) quickly grounded. The battle lasted long and after four hours of intense fighting it was not yet decided who would win. Parker, who was with the rest of the fleet, 200 meters from the Danish line of defense, was fired upon from the cannons at Trekrone Fort, and signaled to Nelson that he should withdraw the fleet. Nelson, however, was determined to win the battle and ignored the order.Pocock, p. 237 Nelson had noticed that many of the Danish ships that had hoisted white flag of surrender, were still firing. Because of this, Nelson sent a curiae with a letter to Crown Prince Frederick in which he argued that he could not account for the remaining crew on board Danish ships if they continued the fight after they had surrendered. Crown Prince Frederick could from his position at the port see that the battle no longer had any purpose and agreed to a truce without consulting the Danish-Norwegian commanders, Olfert Fischer and Steen Bille.Feldb√¶k, pp. 150-157Feldb√¶k, pp. 212-225 Battle of Copenhagen (1801) Aftermath While the British fleet were heading to Denmark the political situation changed drastically. On 21 March the British had entered into peace negotiations with France, and on 24 March, they had sent diplomats to Russia in order to clear the way for a political understanding. The British did not know that shortly afterwards the tsar was to be assassinated, and his son Alexander would take over the throne.Benito & Jensen, p. 203 Tsar Alexander would also prove to be much more interested in improving diplomatic relations with the English than his father had been. Due to the death of Tsar Paul, the League of Armed Neutrality was to be dissolved. The Swedish King, Gustav IV Adolf, chose to look at Denmark-Norway's truce with Britain as treason against the League of Armed Neutrality, and exploited this by playing on Denmark-Norway's weak position in St. Petersburg. The reason for this was because Sweden in fact had great expectations about acquiring Norway from Denmark. The plans still had to be abandoned because of the lack of support from any of the major nations. Prussia, who Denmark-Norway had contributed to push into the League of Armed Neutrality, had withdrawn from the league as soon as the news of the throne changed in Russia reached Berlin. At the same time Prussia now demanded that Denmark-Norway should cede Hamburg, while Prussia kept both Hanover and Laurenburg. Denmark-Norway who had been forced to accept several bitter diplomatic defeats due to their neutrality policy, now turned to Britain through direct negotiations with Lord Hawkesbury. Christian Bernstorff had in late May traveled to London in order to negotiate the return of the parts of the Danish-Norwegian fleet that had been captured by the British during the battle of Copenhagen. At the same time, Bernstorff also negotiated regarding a possible British withdrawal from the Danish- Norwegian colonies they had occupied during the short war. But the negotiations between Denmark-Norway and the United Kingdom would prove to be useless since Denmark had neither anything to offer nor anything to threaten the United kingdom with. =Interval= Although Denmark-Norway had to give up parts of its neutral policy after the defeat in 1801, the country could continue its trade with both Britain and France until the war broke out again between the two countries in May 1803. The war led to further hostilities between France and the Austrian Empire, and after Napoleon's victory over Austrian and Russian troops at Austerlitz on 2 December 1805, the French ruled over most of Central Europe. During the summer of 1806 war also broke out between France and Prussia, and French forces began to advance rapidly towards Denmark's borders after the decisive victory over Prussia at Jena, on 14 October 1806. Denmark was now forced to react and Crown Prince Frederick stationed the majority of his army in Holstein, both as a proof that he did not want to participate in the hostilities in northern Germany and as protection in case of a French invasion. But it would gradually get worse for Denmark-Norway to maintain its neutrality, and especially after Napoleon's final defeat of Prussia in the autumn of 1806, when the French emperor on 21 November that year declared the founding of the Continental System against the United Kingdom. This blockade that would close the entire European continent from trading with Britain, led the United Kingdom, as a reaction, to declare prohibition of neutral ships to trade with France and its allies. After the Treaties of Tilsit on 7 July 1807 Russia also joined the Continental System, as well as France, and Russia agreed to force the other neutral European countries to join the blockade. When this became known, the United Kingdom decided to make Denmark-Norway an ultimatum: Denmark should either join the British alliance, and place its fleet under British command, or disclose the fleet as collateral for its continued neutrality. The reason for this ultimatum was some suspicion that Denmark would incorporate its fleet with the French, or the fear that the French would secure the Danish fleet through military means. For Crown Prince Frederick, the British demands were unrealistic, because if Denmark allied itself with Britain the country would be attacked by France, and the possibilities for Swedish and British forces to be able to help Denmark in defending the country was minimal.Benito & Jensen, pp. 204-205 =Copenhagen (1807)= Copenhagen on fire Since Denmark-Norway refused to accept the British ultimatum the British chose to land a major force in Zealand at Vedb√¶k on 16 August 1807 without any formal declaration of war, and since King Christian VII and Crown Prince Frederick were in Holstein with the majority of the Danish army, the newly appointed commander Ernst Peymann had to face the British invaders with an inferior number of untrained militia.Lindeberg, pp. 94-95 The British quickly initiated the siege of Copenhagen and minor skirmishes occurred south of the capital. On 29 August, a large force of the Danish Militia were also defeated at K√∏ge by British forces under the command of Sir Arthur Wellesley.Lindeberg, pp. 110-111 Since any attempt to defeat the British land forces failed and since the Danish fleet were not ready for battle, the Danes prepared for a British assault on the capital. But the attack never came, because instead of attacking Copenhagen the British began to bombard the city. The bombardment lasted from 2‚Äì6 September and struck to the greatest extent the civilian population, with 195 civilian dead and 678 wounded. After the bombardment on 6 September Peymann gave up and surrendered the city unconditionally to the British, this decision resulted in that he was sentenced to death, but later pardoned. The British now captured all the Danish ships that they could prepare, while they destroyed the rest, and took everything of value on the Danish naval base at Holmen. An offer of a British-Danish alliance was also given to Crown Prince Frederik after the attack on Copenhagen, but this was rejected when France had already set an ultimatum to either join the Continental System, or prepare for war. In December, the British Navy also seized the Danish West Indies and occupied them for nearly eight years. =Alliance with France= The British attack on Copenhagen resulted in Denmark-Norway deciding to form an alliance with France, and on 31 October, the French-Danish alliance was signed at Fontainebleau. Denmark-Norway was now officially at war with Britain, which led to the British occupation of all the Danish colonies.Benito & Jensen, p. 206 At the same time, the British also initiated a blockade of shipping between Denmark and Norway, which led to starvation in Norway since the grain that was grown in Norway and that which was imported from Northern Russia was not enough. Since Sweden had been an ally of Britain in the war against France since 1805, and since Russia after the peace treaty with France at Tilsit had formed an alliance with Napoleon, Tsar Alexander saw this as an opportunity to attack and take Finland from Sweden. So in February 1808 the Russians initiated the Finnish War by marching with 24,000 men into Finland and occupying H√§meenlinna.Sundberg, p. 368 After the Russian attack on Sweden, Crown Prince Frederick also saw an opportunity to take advantage of Sweden's weak position and to take back the areas that Denmark-Norway had lost to Sweden after the Treaty of Br√∂msebro and the Treaty of Roskilde. Denmark had also through the agreement at Fontainebleau promised to help the French and the Russians in a possible attack against Sweden, so on 14 March 1808, one day after the death of King Christian VII, Denmark-Norway also declared war on Sweden. As a result of this declaration of war, Napoleon had chosen to send an auxiliary corps, consisting of troops from France, Spain and the Netherlands, to Denmark. The troops were led by the French Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte, and should along with the Danish-Norwegian troops have launched an invasion of Sk√•ne. But Bernadotte's troops never got further than Zealand since the ice began to break up in the straits between Kattegat and the Baltic Sea as early as in mid-March, and the appearance of the British fleet made it difficult to cross over to Sweden. Bernadotte's troops then had to be accommodated in Kolding, where they also started the fire at Koldinghus. With Bernadotte's troops stranded on the Danish peninsula, the war was instead directed towards the Swedish-Norwegian border, where the Swedish troops in mid-April invaded Norway. The invasion was, however, halted and there were during the spring and summer only local skirmishes between the Norwegian and Swedish forces, before the Swedish troops in the late summer retreated back across the border. A Danish gunboat captures the British brig on 9 June 1808 In August, the news about the Madrid Uprising reached the Spanish troops stationed in Denmark. This led to a mutiny among the Spaniards, and the subsequent evacuation of the La Romana Division, where the British evacuated the majority of the Spanish troops in Denmark. =State bankruptcy= From 1807 to 1813 the war was characterised by high inflation, with wages increasing several hundred percent and grain prices even more. It was not cheap for Denmark to keep an army operating in Holstein and although in 1810 the Danish government introduced a progressive income tax to cover the deficit, it did not have the administrative machinery needed to get this new system to work but instead tried to make up the deficit by printing more and more banknotes. From 1806 to 1813 the currency's total face value increased sixfold but the notes' real value significantly decreased. Thus the state itself went bankrupt, trying to remedy the situation by rushing through a regulation on 5 January 1813 for a change in the monetary system. The regulation determined that a new foreign bank would replace the old banks and start minting new coins with values fixed against foreign banknotes. This made minor savers, people with their money tied up in government bonds, or people holding higher-value banknotes relatively poor.

Even though the good (tortoise) may win in the end, is it worth the wait? It is based on S.G. Sathye's Marathi play Sasa Aani Kasav (Hare and Tortoise). The tortoise -- Rajaram P. Joshi (Naseeruddin Shah) -- is a middle-class clerk living in a chawl (middle-class apartment complex) in Bombay. He is secretly in love with his neighbor, Sandhya Sabnis (Deepti Naval), but is unable to disclose his love for her, mainly due to his timidity. Rajaram is a very good natured and hardworking man. Most of his neighbors and colleagues take advantage of his goodness. One day Rajaram's fast-talking friend Vasudev alias Bashu (Farooq Shaikh) -- the hare -- comes for a visit and makes himself at home. Bashu generally impresses people by his false success stories and his over-the-top attitude. Bashu starts wooing Sandhya, and she falls in love with him. He then joins Rajaram's company, Footprint Shoes, by impressing the owner, Mr. Dhindhoria, with false stories about his work experience and love of golf. He also starts flirting with Dhindhoria's beautiful wife Anuradha (Mallika Sarabhai) and daughter Jojo (Winnie Paranjape) at the same time. In the chawl, the Sabnis family decides to get Sandhya married to Bashu, much to the shock of Rajaram. But on the day of the engagement, Bashu disappears after being caught red-handed, romancing Anuradha, by Jojo. The engagement is called off. Rajaram then offers to marry the devastated Sandhya, but she tells him that she has been very intimate with Bashu and is perhaps pregnant. Rajaram shows his greatness by accepting her in spite of all this and expressing his long hidden love towards her.

History In the late 1930s, the city council decided to build a promenade for separation between bathing areas and hiking or promenading paths. It extended from Bograshov Beach to where Jerusalem (formerly Geula) Beach is located now. The introduction of the promenade was a turning point in common perception of the city's coastline. At the same time, World War II started in September 1939, and the British Mandate Regime prohibited bathing in the beach. As a result of that, the city's beaches were abandoned and neglected. In addition, the developing new city was pouring its sewage to the sea and the beaches were banned for bathing for sanitary reasons. Seaside hotels and caf√©s were turning into questionable bars, gambling joints and brothels. The public abstained from the area, and the city's recreational centers were transferred to the city center, to areas such as Dizengoff Street. In 1942, London Square was founded in the northern part of the promenade. In 1953, Gan-haAtsmaut (Independence Garden) was founded on the gravel hill above Hilton Beach. In 1965, at the time of the opening of the port of Ashdod, the ports of Tel Aviv and Jaffa were closed. In the 1980s Shafdan, the Dan District sewage treatment facility, was founded, and the sewage was transferred to the plant and not to the sea. That enabled the cleansing of the beaches and preparations to be made in order to open them again to the public for bathing. During that period, tombolo breakwaters were placed, causing significant expansion of the beaches allowing a greater number of people to enter. In the scope of the project, beach facilities were restored and reopened. in 2011 the municipality of tel aviv has restored and renovated the promenade and today it runs from the port of tel aviv to the port of jaffa. Sections Tel Aviv Promenade, Metzizim winter flooding *Tel Baruch Promenade - Tel Baruch Promenade runs between Tel Baruch Beach in the north and the Yarkon River in the south. It opened in 2009 in an area previously belonging to Reading Power Station and Sde Dov Airfield. The construction of the promenade required a long pedestrian bridge over the power station's docks. It is paved with concrete, with separate trails for pedestrians and bicyclists. The eastern side, adjacent to Sde Dov, is lined with shore vegetation, while the western side allows access to the undeclared beach along it. This section of the promenade is mostly secluded from the city, although there are plans for significant construction along it, should the airfield be relocated. *Port Promenade - The Port Promenade runs along the restored Tel Aviv Port, between the mouth of the Yarkon River and Metzizim Beach. It opened in 2005, and it is made up of a wooden deck built along the Port's old sea wall. It is mostly commercial in nature, with many coffee houses, restaurants and shops, but without any bathing beaches. *Metzizim/Hilton Promenade - This promenade runs between Metzizim Beach in the north and Gordon Beach in the south. This promenade has two distinct sections: an older one between Metzizim and Hilton Beaches and a newer one between Hilton and Gordon. It is somewhat narrower than Lahat Promenade because of its location between the kurkar (bluffs and the beach. *Lahat Promenade (Herbert Samuel St.) - The main promenade in Tel Aviv, leading from Gordon beach to Aviv beach. The promenade was built in 1939 as a narrow promenade, elevated above sea level. In the 1980s it was demolished in preparation for reconstruction. In 1982, the first section was opened for public. The new promenade is broad and paved with pebbles. It is separated from the beach by a narrow strip of shore vegetation. On the promenade are several artistic sculptures and memorial plaques. In 1998, the promenade was renamed in honor of former mayor Shlomo Lahat, who was in office during the construction years and promoted the process. *Sha'ar Le'Yafo Promenade (Gate to Jaffa promenade) - The section that links Charles Clore Park and Jaffa. *Khomot ha'Yam Promenade (Sea barriers promenade) The section that links Sha'ar Le'Yafo Promenade and the Jaffa Port.

Little is known of his life. He was probably a native Englishman,Lapidge \\"Dominic of Evesham\\" Analecta Bollandiana pp. 67‚Äì68 and was probably born sometime before 1077, and was probably raised around the abbey. He may have entered Evesham before 1077, but certainly by 1104, he was a monk at Evesham, as his name appears in a document as a member of the abbey. Sometime before 1125 he became prior of Evesham, as he was named prior in an account of the consecration of Samson as Bishop of Worcester that year. He was still prior after 1130, when he witnessed two charters of Reginald Foliot, then the abbot. By 1145 he had been succeeded by Richard as prior, and no further records mention Dominic.Jennings \\"Writings\\" English Historical Review p. 298 Dominic certainly wrote four works: Vita Sancti Egwini, Vita Sancti Odulfi, Acta Proborum Virorum, and a collection of Miracles of the Virgin. The Vita Sancti Egwini, or Life of Saint Egwin, was a history of Evesham's founder, St Egwin, and consists of two books.Lapidge \\"Dominic of Evesham\\" Analecta Bollandiana p. 70 This work became the standard source for Egwin's life in the later Middle Ages, replacing an earlier Life written by Byrhtferth which had been Dominic's source for his first book.Lapidge \\"Dominic of Evesham\\" Analecta Bollandiana pp. 71‚Äì74 The Vita Sancti Odulfi gave a hagiography of St Odulf, a missionary to Brabant whose relics were enshrined at Evesham. The Acta Proborum Virorum was a miscellaneous compilation of tales and legends relating to Evesham Abbey. The work on the Virgin's miracles is one of the earliest such works.

History and overview The museum owes its existence to a proposal made by Bernardino Rivadavia before the First Triumvirate of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata in 1812. The ongoing struggle for Independence from the Spanish colonial period stalled Rivadavia's project, however, until 1823, when he promoted construction of a building for the museum as a member of Governor Mart√≠n Rodr√≠guez's cabinet. The original museum opened in 1826 and was housed downtown in a loft inside the Santo Domingo Convent, which had been made available to host Rivadavia after his expulsion of the Dominican order from Buenos Aires. Rivadavia closely oversaw the construction of the institution, the first of its kind in South America, and appointed Italian Argentine botanist Carlos Ferraris as its first director. Receiving a large gift of materials and equipment from Presbyterian Minister Bartolom√© Mu√±oz in 1813, the museum started with a collection of 800 animal and 1500 mineral specimens, among others. Rivadavia also appointed a noted Italian astronomer, Ottaviano Fabrizio Mossotti, who installed the nation's first observatory, meteorological station and experimental physics laboratory during his tenure at the facility from 1828 to 1835. Among those who consulted the museum's growing staff of researchers was Alexander von Humboldt, who requisitioned numerous meteorological studies for the Institut de France. Detail of the Cenozoic paleontology hallExterior of the National Natural Sciences Institute, facing Parque Centenario The rise of the paramount Governor of Buenos Aires, Juan Manuel de Rosas, turned to be the renowned institution's undoing. Devoutly religious, Governor Rosas returned the convent to the Dominican order in October 1835, forcing the museum to relocate to smaller, nearby buildings. Much of its equipment and research was lost during the forced relocation, and Ferrari and Mossotti returned to Italy. Rosas' overthrow in 1852 helped lead to the creation of the Society of Friends of Natural History, who had the museum relocated in 1854 to the \\"Illuminated block,\\" the former Temple of St. Ignatius and its prestigious academy maintained by the Jesuits before their suppression in 1773. The recovering of the museum motivated the German naturalist Hermann Burmeister to stay in Buenos Aires. A visit to the museum followed in 1857. Recommended by Humboldt, Herman was appointed as its director in 1862. Burmeister founded the Argentine Paleontological Society in concert with the University of Buenos Aires and the Academy of Natural Sciences in C√≥rdoba in 1870, extending the interest for the field to the nation's hinterland. Burmeister also founded the museum's first periodical in 1874, opening the museum and its research to active peer review. Notable among the European researchers who took notice was Dutch zoologist Hendrik Weyenbergh, who arrived in C√≥rdoba, where he founded the Argentine National Academy of Sciences. The museum published numerous works under Burmeister's direction, who also donated a sizable part of its growing collection for the sake of the new La Plata Museum in 1884. An accident at the museum cost its noted German Argentine director his life in 1892. The museum was later directed by zoologist Florentino Ameghino, its first Argentinian director. Ameghino incorporated adjoining buildings to the museum, which remained inadequate for its vast collection and facilities. Addressing this, Director Mart√≠n Doello-Jurado secured Congress' authorization for new museum facilities in 1925. Built on the western end of Parque Centenario. The first wing of the new museum was given in 1929 and the institution was inaugurated in 1937. Part of the museum's collection was transferred to the University of Buenos Aires Ethnographic Museum during the administration of President Juan Per√≥n, who dismissed Doello-Jurado in 1946 as part of a wider intervention in national academics. Per√≥n, however, also ordered the construction in 1948 of the museum's annex, which housed the National Natural Sciences Institute. The museum was transferred to the National Research Council (CONICET) in 1996 and, continuing to thrive, an internet data bank was created for the museum in 2002. Besides the Natural Sciences Institute, the museum houses thirteen permanent exhibition halls, including an aquarium, a display with specimens collected from Argentina's numerous research stations in Antarctica, a geological collection centered on meteorites found in Argentina, a paleontology section notable for its Carnotaurus, Eoraptor, Herrerasaurus and Patagosaurus fossils, among others, and a Cenozoic paleontology display featuring Glyptodon, Macrauchenia, Megatherium and Smilodon fossils. Academics and the general public can also avail themselves of a science auditorium, an art gallery, library and a caf√©.

Personal life He was born at Gottorp as a son of Landgrave Charles of Hesse-Kassel and Princess Louise of Denmark, who was herself the daughter of Frederick V of Denmark. Prince Frederik married German noblewoman Klara von Brockdorff (Baroness Clarelia Dorothea von Liliencron, n√©e von Brockdorff) (born in Rohlstorf, 16 January 1778, died in Rendsburg 24 August 1836) in Norway on 21 May 1813. Because the marriage was a morganatic one, she was not awarded the title of Princess. Career Frederick was a close relative of the Dano-Norwegian royal family, and had a military career from a very young age. He became Colonel already in 1778, Major General in 1783 and Lieutenant General in 1789. He headed the King's Regiment from 1795 to 1800, and from 1800 to 1808 Prince Frederick was governor in Rendsborg and Inspector-General for the footmen in the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. In 1808 he was made General in the infantry. The following year, he was appointed to lead a Danish army from Zealand to Scania, as a part of the Dano-Swedish War. The campaign was dropped by the Danish government. In July 1809 the prince was sent to serve in Norway. The reason was that the Governor-General, Christian August of Augustenborg was suspected to drop his loyalty to King Frederick VI in order to be adopted as the Swedish throne heir. Frederick was the commanding general in the southern part of the country. Christian August left Norway for Sweden on 7 January 1810, and Frederick became Vice Governor- General on 9 January. Frederick was an active Governor-General. During his period in Norway, he also served as praeses of the Royal Norwegian Society for Development. However, King Frederick VI eventually felt the need to replace him with his heir, Crown Prince Christian Frederick, who assumed office on 23 May 1813. Around this time, Frederick also parted ways with his longtime aide- de-camp, Hans Henrik Rode. In 1813‚Äì1814, the prince led the Danish Auxiliary Corps in Holstein. This was during the War of the Sixth Coalition, in which Denmark-Norway fought on the French side. The main task for his corps was to assist the forces of Louis-Nicolas Davout. When France suffered a loss at the Battle of Leipzig, Frederick's corps had to retreat, and in December 1813 he led his troops from Rostock to Rendsborg, saving the army from annihilation. He even led his troops to a victory in the Battle of Sehested on 10 December 1813. He then planned an attack on the Russian and Swedish occupational forces in Holstein. This attack was abandoned after the peace settlement between Sweden and Denmark-Norway, the Treaty of Kiel of 14 January 1814. From 1815 to 1818, the prince led the Danish occupational forces in France. After returning home, he was once again made commanding general in Schleswig and Holstein, and governor of Rendsborg. From 1836 to 1842 he served as Governor-General over Schleswig and Holstein, succeeding his late father Charles. Frederick was also promoted to field marshal. He had been decorated with the Order of the Elephant in 1801 and became a Grand Commander of the Order of the Dannebrog after his success in 1813. Prince Frederick spent his last years at the family estate Panker by the Baltic Sea. He died here in February 1845.

It contained 16 articles by non-Communist and anti-Communist dissidents in the Socialist Republic of Slovenia, discussing the possibilities and conditions for the democratization of Slovenia and the achievement of full sovereignty. It was issued as a reaction to the Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts and to the rising centralist aspirations within the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. The authors of the Contributions analyzed the different aspects of political and social conditions in Slovenia, especially in its relations to Yugoslavia. Most of the contributors called for the establishment of a sovereign, democratic and pluralist Slovene state, although direct demands for independence were not uttered. The publication provoked a scandal throughout former Yugoslavia. The editors of Nova revija were called to defend themselves in a state-sponsored public discussion, organized by the Socialist Alliance of the Working People. The editorial board was forced to step down, but no public prosecution was conducted again any of the authors, and the journal could continue issuing without restrictions. The publications is usually considered as the direct prelude of the so-called Slovene Spring, a mass political movement for democratization that started the following year by protests against the Ljubljana trial against four journalists arrested by the Yugoslav military police. In the following years, many of the authors of the Contributions became active in the political parties of the DEMOS coalition, especially the Slovene Democratic Union.

However, he was preceded by Michael Shen Fu-Tsung, Arcadio Huang, and Rabban Bar Sauma, all of whom died abroad instead of returning to China.  Life  Fan was born in Pingyao, Shanxi, in 1682. Little is known of his early life and family, but at some point he appears to have met the Piedmontese Jesuit missionary, Antonio Francesco Giuseppe Provana, who converted him to Roman Catholicism and baptised him as \\"Luigi\\" or \\"Louis\\". At the time, the different Catholic orders in China were engaged in a controversy over the legitimacy of Confucian or ancestral veneration. In January 1707, the papal legate Charles-Thomas Maillard De Tournon presented decree ' to the Kangxi Emperor, forbidding Catholic converts from participating in such rituals. The emperor ordered the Jesuits to assemble a second mission to attempt to change the pope's mind on the subject. Fan accompanied three Jesuits: Provana, Jos√© Ram√≥n Arx√≥, and Fran√ßois No√´l, the last of whom had participated in the first unsuccessful embassy. They left Macao aboard the Portuguese ship ' on 14 January 1708.. The journey allowed Fan to observe Batavia in the Dutch East Indies (now Jakarta, Indonesia) and Bahia in Brazil, probably making him the first Chinese person to return and write about the Americas.. They arrived in Lisbon in September 1708, and Fan met King Jo√£o V of Portugal soon afterwards.. No√´l may have travelled ahead, but Provana and Fan remained in Portugal for months, only reaching Rome in February of the next year. Unable to change Clement's mind on the issue of the Chinese rituals, Fan toured Italy, studied Latin and theology, and was able to make many first-hand observations of aspects of 18th-century Europe, which very few Asians had had the opportunity to do before him.. In 1717, he was ordained as a priest. In 1718, Pope Clement XI decided to send Provana back to China, so on May 19, 1719, Provana and Fan boarded the Francisco Xavier in Lisbon and set sail once again.. Provana died during the voyage, and Fan returned to Macao alone. From Macao, he travelled north to Beijing for an audience with the Kangxi Emperor that was held on October 11, 1720. No account of his meeting with the emperor has survived, but Fan wrote a short report of his experiences in Europe, the Shen Jian Lu (Ë∫´Ë¶ãÈåÑ), which may have been created to complement the information he gave the emperor in person.

The N85 runs on Symbian OS v9.3 with S60 3rd Edition platform with Feature Pack 2. It was released in October, retailing for 450 euros before taxes. The major feature N85 introduced was an AMOLED display, giving brighter and sharper colours. The N85 has a dual-slider like the Nokia N95 to access either media playback buttons or a numeric keypad, and is about 25% slimmer in size. The upper sliding keys illuminate between four multimedia keys in music or video playback, and two gaming keys during the playing of N-Gage 2.0 games. It also has a Navi wheel like the Nokia N81 which it replaced and bases its design from, as well as a GPS receiver, 5-megapixel camera with dual LED flash, and an FM transmitter. The N85 was well received as a decent upgrade to the N95, as well as better than the actual flagship, Nokia N96, which costed 100 euros more with few additions and was somewhat critically negative. Compared to the N96, the N85 is thinner and lighter, has a camera lens cover, has a larger battery capacity, USB charging (via the microUSB port), and an AMOLED screen; although without large internal memory or a DVB-H receiver.

It is widely considered Cui's most famous and most important work, and one of the most influential songs in the history of the People's Republic of China, both as a seminal point in the development of Chinese rock music and as a political sensation. The song was an unofficial anthem for Chinese youth and activists during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. Both in its lyrics and instruments, the song mixes traditional Chinese styles with modern rock elements. In the lyrics, the speaker addresses a girl who is scorning him because he has nothing. However, the song has also been interpreted as being about the dispossessed youth of the time, because it evokes a sense of disillusionment and lack of individual freedom that was common among the young generation during the 1980s. Historical context By the late 1970s, Western rock music was gaining popularity in mainland China. After the Cultural Revolution ended in the mid-1970s and the government began a period of economic reform called gaige kaifang, many students and businessmen went abroad and brought back Western music. Chinese singers began performing covers of popular Western rock songs. At the same time, Chinese society and the Chinese government were quickly abandoning Maoism, and promoting economic policies that had a more capitalist orientation. Many Chinese teens and students were becoming disillusioned with their government, which they felt had abandoned its ideals. Because of the rapid economic changes, many of them felt that they had no opportunities and no individual freedom. These developments formed the background against which \\"Nothing to My Name\\" appeared in 1986. Music and lyricsMusical style= Cui Jian was heavily influenced by Western artists such as Bob Dylan, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, and Talking Heads; in the late 1980s he even performed with a hair style modeled on that of John Lennon. In \\"Nothing to My Name\\" and other songs, he intentionally altered the sounds of traditional Chinese musical instruments by mixing them with elements of rock music, such as electric guitar. He also purposely divorced his musical style from that of the revolutionary songs and proletarian operas that were common under Chairman Mao Zedong during the Cultural Revolution--for example, he performed his music very loud, as high as 150 decibels, just because Mao had considered loud music disruptive to the social order. In genre, the song is often called the first work of Xibeifeng, a 1980s music style originating from Northwest China. Cui himself, however, considers the song \\"pure\\" rock and roll. =Lyrics and meaning= Interpretations of the song's meaning vary from one listener to the next; some people view it as a song about love and desire, while others understand it as a political metaphor, the lyrics being addressed as much to the Chinese nation as to a girlfriend. Ethnomusicologist Timothy Brace has described this common analysis of the song lyrics as \\"recast[ing] the setting of this piece from that of a boy talking to his girlfriend to that of a youthful generation talking to the nation as a whole.\\" The ambiguity is heightened by the structure of the phrase yƒ´ w√∫ su≈è y≈èu, an idiomatic chengyu. It literally means \\"to have nothing\\" and has no grammatical subject. Therefore, it can be interpreted as meaning \\"I have nothing\\" (implying that it is a song about two people), or \\"we have nothing\\" (understanding it as social commentary). The narrator of the song worries that the girl he is addressing will ignore him because he has nothing to give her; likewise, the song's audience in the 1980s--young students and workers--were also suffering from not having resources to marry, to be with their girlfriends and boyfriends, or to attract members of the opposite sex. The lyrics also express Western concepts of individualism, and were some of the first popular song lyrics in China to promote self-expression and self-empowerment. This put the song in stark contrast with older music, which had emphasized conformity and obedience. As the narrator, later on in the song, confidently proclaims to the girl that he will \\"grab her hands\\" (\\"\\") and then she will go with him (\\"\\"), he suggests in the end that she can love the fact that he has nothing (\\"\\"). On one level, this suggests that the song is about \\"love conquering all\\", but the line has also been interpreted as threatening, and suggestive of an unorthodox and \\"Dionysian\\" mix of love and aggression. Understood as social commentary, the substitution of \\"we\\" along with the replacement of every \\"you\\" with the Communist Party, means the song becomes an ironic response to the Chinese lyrics of \\"The Internationale\\". alt=Close-up of a man onstage with a guitar wearing jeans and a baggy shirt. His head is lowered and his face is obscured by a white hat with a red star on it. In the background is musical equipment. Release and impact Cui wrote \\"Nothing to My Name\\" himself and first performed it on a televised music competition in May 1986, with his band ADO. The song was an instant success, creating a \\"sensation\\" and turning Cui into a cult figure among urban youth. It was one of the first examples of Chinese, as opposed to imported, rock and roll music to gain popularity in China. The government-controlled People's Daily gave the song a positive review, despite its politically sensitive message. The song was included on Cui's 1989 album Rock 'n' Roll on the New Long March, released by the China Tourism Sound and Video Publishing Company. (The version of the album released overseas was called Nothing to My Name.) By 1989, it had become a \\"battle song\\" or \\"anthem\\" among the youth movement. Cui performed the song live at the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. The performances by Cui and other rock artists during the protests have been described as \\"a revolutionary few days that rocked a nation,\\" and many protesters sang \\"Nothing to My Name\\" to give voice to their rebellion against the government, and their desire for personal freedom and self-expression. Brace describes how, during Cui's Tiananmen performance, students \\"jumped to their feet and began to sing,\\" a practice that had rarely happened at music performances in China before then. Not long after Tiananmen, Cui was restricted to playing in small venues; he did not play before a large audience in Beijing again until 2005. Cui has become known as the \\"Father of Chinese Rock\\", and \\"Nothing to My Name\\" has become his most famous song. It has been described as \\"the biggest hit in Chinese history\\" and the beginning of Chinese rock.. \\"China's rock music history began in 1986, when Cui Jian's now-famous song \\"Nothing to My Name\\" (Yi Wu Suo You) appeared in public for the first time.\\" See also *1989 Tiananmen Square protests NotesReferences   * * Category:1986 singles Category:Chinese songs Category:Cui Jian songs Category:Mandarin-language songs Category:Protest songs Category:1989 Tiananmen Square protests ","title":"Nothing to My Name"},{"id":"21740006","text":"Charles EP, or simply named Skids, is the first disc and EP of punk rock band Skids, recorded in October 1977 and released on 24 February 1978 on the Scottish punk label No Bad.

The company was among the first agencies to envision a system of branding that unified the entire shopping experience. Watt and other key players in the Watt Group over the years are credited with introducing premium private label brand design to the North American Market. Some of the more recognized brand designs include Home Depot's orange logohttps://nationalpost.com/arts/colours/story.html?id=610667 and store concept, Sam's Choice, No Name and President's Choice. Watt was the first designer to use photosymbolism on packaging, for Nestle Instant Coffee. BiographyEarly life= Don Watt was born in Regina, Saskatchewan. His father worked in the military and his mother would often paint pictures while his father was on duty, this inspired Don early on to pursue a career as an animator. He graduated from the Ontario College of Art for industrial design. =Career= Watt's first job after graduation was for A.V. Roe, working on the design for the Avro Arrow and the \\"flying saucer\\"‚Äîa special project for the U.S. Army. He went on to work for Warner Brothers in California, doing animation for Bugs Bunny, but then soon moved onto package design. After working as a creative director for Hathaway-Templeton, where he worked on finalizing the design of the Canadian Flag, Watt founded Don Watt and Associates in 1966. Soon after, the firm landed the account to redesign the Nestle brand in Canada. During the early inception of the firm Watt also worked on the design of the Canadian Pavilion at Expo 67. In 1973, Watt was hired by Galen Weston, to help resuscitate the Loblaws brand. Watt designed the brand, stores, packaging for \\"no name\\" generic products, \\"President's Choice\\" premium products, \\"Too Good to be True\\" nutritious healthy products and \\"Green\\" for environmentally friendly products. Soon after the product launches, Watt suggested that then-current spokesperson William Shatner be replaced by Loblaws president Dave Nichol, after Shatner's availability became limited by his involvement in a new television series. The enhanced store flyer featuring Nichol's product picks, The Insider Report, soon followed. In 1987, The Watt Group was recognized by the Harvard Business School for developing solutions to classic profit-improvement problems, using strategic design to effect change in consumer response. However, in 1992 Watt sold the somewhat ailing Watt Group to billion dollar company beverage maker Cott Corporation, to market branding to retailers across North America, Europe and Australia. From 1992 to 1999 The Watt Group flourished with the association with Cott. Cott CEO and major shareholder, Jerry Pencer attracted Gary Oakley as creative head; David Boyd, production guru, Richard Garvin, retail store designer, Patrick Rodmell, business development expert, and Ted Zittell, retail strategist. To lead this team, he engaged Ira Teich as CEO and Managing Director of the Watt Group. The Watt Group grew rapidly and profitably under this format until the death of Cott's founder and chief shareholder, Jerry Pencer in 1999. Watt International With the help of Envoy Communications, Watt bought back the Watt Group in 1999, renamed as Watt International, and merged it with the International Design Group (IDG) to expand the business's offering and better deliver his vision of holistic retail experiences. Watt's namesake agency continues on this path, and today operates as a truly integrated retail agency. Beyond branding, store and packaging design, Watt International offers a broad range of strategically led creative services, addressing all of the channels and touchpoints that impact retail experience, be they physical or virtual, rational or emotional.

He is most noted for having commanded the Zulus at the Battle of Rorke's Drift. He was a half-brother of the Zulu king Cetshwayo kaMpande. After the defeat of the Zulus, and the deposition of Cetshwayo, Dabulamanzi campaigned for the return of his brother to power. When Cetshwayo was restored in 1883 Dabulamanzi fought on his behalf to maintain the unity of the Zulu kingdom. Life His father was Mpande, the previous Zulu King, which made him a half-nephew of the famous and legendary Shaka. His mother was Sanguza, one of Mpande's many wives. =Anglo-Zulu war= He took part in the Battle of Isandlwana, where he led the Undi Corps. He then led the Zulu force at the Battle of Rorke's Drift. Dabulamanzi had been specifically instructed by his brother not to attack the British outside Zulu territory, but ignored him.Ian Knight, The Zulu War 1879, Osprey, 2003, , p. 33. Dabulamanzi's tactics were ineffective, allowing the small British force at Rorke's Drift to repel the Zulus. Dabulamanzi subsequently organised the Siege of Eshowe, a blockade at Fort Eshowe which isolated British troops for two months. When Lord Chelmsford arrived with a relief force, Dabulamanzi led the right wing of the Zulu army. At the Battle of Gingindlovu, the Zulus were defeated.John Laband, Historical Dictionary of the Zulu Wars, Scarecrow Press, 2009, p.59. =Later career= Dabulamanzi became the focal figure of anti-British sentiment in the aftermath of the war, and was a vocal opponent of Theophilus Shepstone and John Robert Dunn, Cetshwayo's former adviser who sided with the British and acquired large landholdings after the British victory.Frederick Hale, Norwegian Missionaries in Natal and Zululand: Selected Correspondence 1844-1900, Van Riebeeck Society, The, 1996, p.114. Dabulamanzi was keen to ensure his brother's return to power in Zululand. Conflicts between rival factions prompted the British to re-establish Cetshwayo as king in an attempt to restore order, but the conflicts continued. Dabulamanzi led the fight against Cetshwayo's principal enemy Zibhebhu kaMaphitha, who was supported by Boer mercenaries. Dabulamanzi was defeated by Zibhebhu in battle at Msebe and oNdini. After Cetshwayo's death he supported the king's son Dinuzulu, negotiating an alliance with Boer mercenaries in 1884. The exorbitant demands for land by the mercenaries led to further conflicts. In 1886, he was shot dead during a scuffle with a group of Boers.

The species may be the most common trematode endemic to the United States. The life cycle of the N. salmincola requires three hosts. The first intermediate host is an Juga plicifera stream snail. The second intermediate host is a salmonid fish, though some non-salmonid fishes also play a role. Lastly, the definitive host is most commonly a canid, though many other mammals are also definitive hosts, including humans. Transmission of N. salmincola to the definitive host occurs upon ingestion of parasite-infected fish. The parasite is most known for its association with ‚Äúsalmon poisoning disease\\", which, left untreated, is fatal to dogs and other canids. However, canids are affected by the Neorickettsia helminthoeca bacteria, for which N. salmincola acts as a vector, and not by the parasite itself. Very few known cases of naturally acquired human infection with N. salmincola are found in the literature, though it is likely that many cases are unreported, since most people are asymptomatic, or symptomatic with non-specific symptoms like gastrointestinal discomfort. Disease caused by N. salmincola, or nanophyetiasis, is easily preventable by thoroughly cooking fish before consumption. There are no known cases of human infection by the Rickettsia bacteria carried by N. salmincola. A subspecific parasite, Nanophyetus schikhobalowi, is endemic to Siberia, where human cases of nanophyetiasis have been reported in scientific literature since 1931.Skrjabin, K. J., and Podjapolskaja, W. P., (1931).Nanophyetus schikhobalowi, n. sp., em neuer Trematode aus Darm des Menschen. Zlb. Ba/ct. I. Orig., 119: 294‚Äì297. Discovery The first record of salmon poisoning disease (SPD) was reported in northwestern Oregon in 1814 when a writer for Henry‚Äôs Astoria Journal noted the death of dogs after consumption of raw salmon.Min, Elijah. Nanophyetiasis. 2003. Stanford University. 12 Feb. 2009. At first, investigators believed that SPD was caused by poisonous blood in the ingested fish.Thornton, J.Q. (1849). ‚ÄúOregon and California in 1848‚Äù. Vol.1, Harper & Bros. In 1911, small white cysts were observed in the kidneys of disease-causing salmon and trout, but the cysts were mistakenly identified as amebae. Small trematodes in the intestines of dogs that died after eating infected salmon were finally found in 1925 and the cysts present in the salmon were correctly identified as intermediate stages of the trematode.Donham, C.R. (1925a). Science 61:341. In an experimental follow-up study, researchers showed that the small intestinal parasite did in fact cause SPD in dogs, and that the cysts did develop into the adult worm found in the intestine.Donham, C.R., Simms, B.T. and Miller, F.W. (1926). J. Am. Vet. Med. Ass. 68:701‚Äì715 The trematode was first named by Chapin as Nanophyes salmincola in 1926, as a member of the family Heterophyidae.Chapin, E. A. (1926). N. Am. Vet. 7:36‚Äì37. Upon further examination of the morphology, Chapin reassigned the trematode to the family Troglotrematidae and renamed the parasite Nanophyetus salmincola, since Nanophyes was already taken.Chapin, E. A. (1928) J. Parasitol. 14: 60. Discussions regarding the correctness of classification of the parasite continued as the trematode received further scientific attention and its morphology and behavior was further scrutinized. Ultimately, Nanophyetus salmincola was agreed upon, though Troglotrema salmincola remains a synonym. In 1931, Skrjabin and Podjapolskaja describe a similar parasite, Nanophyetus schikhobalowi, which was endemic to East Siberia. Argument regarding whether or not N. schikhobalowi and N. salmincola were the same or different species recurred until 1966 when the two were granted subspecific status in order to reflect their biological and geographic differences, but little significant morphological differences.Filimonova, L.V.

Since its discovery, N. schikhobalowi has been known to naturally infect humans and research reveals surveys indicating rates of infection in endemic Siberian villages of up to 98%. In contrast, N. salmincola was not recognized to be a source of an infection until a researcher purposefully infected himself in a scientific experiment in 1958.Philip, C. B. (1958). Proc. 10th Int. Congr. Ent., Montreal, 1956, 3:651‚Äì653. Besides Philip experimentally infecting himself with the North American N. salmincola, the first naturally acquired human intestinal infection cases were observed between September 1974 and October 1985. The study revealed 10 patients who presented with positive N. salmincola stool samples and either gastrointestinal complaints or otherwise unexplainable peripheral blood eosinophilia. 7 patients recalled ingestion of undercooked or raw fish. Of those who were not given effective treatment, symptoms and/or eggs in stools persisted for 2 or more months before spontaneously resolving. It was hypothesized that the movement, attachment, and irritation of the adult worms in the small intestine mucosa was the likely cause of gastrointestinal symptoms and peripheral eosinophilia. Two years after the first 10 cases of human infection with N. salmincola were reported in 1987, Fritsche et al. reported ten additional cases of human nanophyetiasis.Fritsche TR, Eastburn RL, Wiggins LH, Terhune CA Jr. (1989) Praziquantel for treatment of human Nanophyetus salmincola (Troglotrema salmincola) infection. 160(5):896-9. Five presented with gastrointestinal complaints and the other five had unexplained peripheral eosinophilia. Nine out of ten recalled eating inadequately cooked fish. This time, praziquantel was the effective treatment of choice. In 1990, the first case of human infection with N. salmincola without ingestion of raw or undercooked contaminated fish was reported. A man was infected through hand contamination while handling highly infected, fresh-killed, coho salmon. A diagnosis of nanophyetiasis was made based on gastrointestinal discomfort, peripheral blood esoinophilia and a positive stool sample. Treatment with praziquantel was effective. None of the human cases of infection with either the North American or Siberian subspecies reveal infection by the Neorickettsia helminthoeca carried within the trematode, which was discovered in 1950. Infection by rickettsia helps to explain the more fatal outcome afflicting canids. Clinical presentation in humans Upon infection with N. salmincola, humans are normally asymptomatic. If symptoms are present, they are usually non- specific and mistaken for indication of other gastrointestinal problems. Symptoms include ‚Äúdiarrhea, unexplained peripheral blood eosinophilia, abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting, weight loss, and fatigue.‚Äù Eggs of N. salmincola appear in stools approximately one week after ingestion of infected fish. Pathology in dogs Nanophysiasis in dogs is much more serious than in humans. Scientists noticed almost 200 years ago that dogs that consumed raw fish sometimes died rather quickly. This ‚Äúsalmon poisoning‚Äù, while associated with the trematode Nanophyetus salmincola is not caused by the worm. The sickness is caused by Neorickettsia helminthoeca, a rickettsial bacteria that uses the N. salmincola as a host. Although only canines are susceptible to the disease raccoons show a raised temperature and lymphatic infection after being infected by the rickettsia, but both soon subside.RE Milleman and SE Knapp, ‚ÄúBiology of Nanopheyus Salmincola and ‚ÄúSalmon Poisoning‚Äù Disease‚Äù Advanced Parasitology, 8 (1970): 33 The incubation period in dogs is 5‚Äì7 days, although it may take as long as 33 days. After onset, there is a sharp fever coupled with anorexia, vomiting and dysentery. The rickettsia attacks the canine‚Äôs lymph system causing enlarging and eventually hemorrhaging many of the lymphnodes. The disease can spread to other tissues such as leukocytes. Death occurs 10‚Äì14 days after signs first appear. Transmission Nanophyetus salmincola is transmitted most commonly by the ingestion of raw, undercooked, or smoked salmon or steelhead trout. Usually this is meant to be ingestion of the muscle of the fish but there have been cases reported in which the suspected agent of transmission was Steelhead roe. Researchers hypothesize, in fish with especially high worm burdens, that the N. salmincola may migrate to many of the fishes tissues, not just the muscle tissue. In a case in 1990 Nanophyetiasis was diagnosed in an individual that is thought to have acquired the disease by simple handling of fresh-killed salmon. The infected individual, ironically, was a researcher studying N.salmincola in juvenile Coho salmon, had inadvertently initiated the infection by hand-to-mouth contact during the 3-month-long study.Lee W. Harrell and Thomas Deardorff ‚Äú Human Nanophyetiasis: Transmission by Handling Naturally Infected Coho Salmon‚Äù The Journal of Infectious Diseases, 161-1 (1990): 146 Reservoir The reservoirs for N. salmincola are raccoons, mink, and skunks. Reservoirs are organisms that harbor parasites within themselves without suffering any signs of pathology, and spreading the parasites through their natural behavior. For example, raccoons naturally spread N. salmincola because they frequently eat fish and defecate parasitic eggs in or near the water, where subsequent larval stages can continue their life cycle. Vector Vectors are organisms that transmit parasites from one host to another. Juga plicifera stream snails are biological vectors for a larval stage of N. salmincola. Salmonid and some non-salmonid fish are vectors of the metacercariae of N. salmincola. Both fresh and ocean water fish can be parasitic vectors. Fish that act as second intermediate hosts are different species of the families Salmonidae, Cottidae, and Cyprinidae. Among the thirty-four natural and experimental secondary hosts found in scientific literature are the coastal cutthroat trout, rainbow trout, coho salmon, chum salmon, and kokanee salmon. More infection occurs in salmonid fish, rather than non-salmonid fish. In particular, salmonid fish of the genera Salmo, Oncorhynchus, and Salvelinus play a significant role in the N. salmincola life cycle.Witenburg, G. (1932) On the anatomy and systematic position of the causative agent of so-called salmon poisoning. J. Parasitol. 18:258‚Äì263. The parasite itself is also a vector for Neorickettsia helminthoeca. Definitive Hosts Definitive hosts include fish-eating birds and mammals. The most common definitive hosts are the domestic dog, cat, and red fox. Humans are also definitive hosts for N. salmincola. A long list of experimental definitive hosts include the hamster and wood rat. An experimental study failed to infect two white rats and two white mice. Trematodes exist along the whole length of the small intestine in smaller animals like hamsters, while they exist only in the upper end of the small intestine in larger animals like dogs. Incubation period After ingestion of fish infected with N. salmincola, it takes about 1 week for symptoms to occur, namely for eggs to be detected in the stool. Morphology Eggs of N. salmincola are light brown, ovoid, and operculate at one end, with a small blunt projection at the other end. They measure 0.087 mm to 0.097 mm by 0.038 mm to 0.055 mm. There are normally 5 to 16 eggs in the uterus, and their heaviness allows them to sink rapidly in water. N. salmincola is a digenic trematode, which means that it is an unsegmented worm that is flattened dorsoventrally. Adult worms alternate shape from ‚Äúa sphere to a long blunt rod.‚Äù The worms are 0.8 to 1.1mm long and 0.3 to 0.5 mm wide and are hermaphroditic, having both male and female reproductive organs in the same organism. The two large oval testes are 0.2 to 0.3 mm long and the round ovary is 0.07 to 0.11 mm in diameter. N. salmincola has a prominent cirrus pouch, or hollow organ surrounding the male copulatory organ, but no seminal vesicle. True to its character as a trematode, it has an oral sucker 0.15 to 0.18 mm in diameter, and a ventral sucker 0.12 to 0.13 mm in diameter. The oral and ventral suckers are used to grasp and crawl actively about the intestinal tissue of its host, though the worm leaves no extensive mechanical damage. Life cycle The adult lays eggs within the vertebrate host. The vertebrate passes out the eggs in its feces. The first larval stage, the miracidia, develop within the eggs, hatch, and swim away. The miracidia then penetrate the first intermediate host, the Juga plicifera stream snail. After further development in the stream snail, N. salmincola larva develop into rediae, which give rise to cercariae. The cercariae emerge from the snail and penetrate the second intermediate host, the salmonid (some non-salmonid) fish. The parasites develop into metacercaria and encyst within the kidneys, muscles, and fins of the salmonid fish. The parasites enter its final host, including canids and humans, upon ingestion of the infected fish, and develop into adult worms that produce eggs to be passed in the host‚Äôs feces.John, David T., and William A. Petri, Jr. Markell and Voge‚Äôs Medical Parasitology. St. Louis: Elsevier Inc., 2006. Detailed information regarding the life cycle stages Eggs and miracidia: The eggs passed in the feces are unembryonated. Experimental studies demonstrate that eggs collected in room water temperature require 75 days to 200 days to hatch., The hatching rate of miracidia from eggs increases with decreasing temperatures, and egg mortality increases with increasing temperatures. Fully developed miracidia within the eggs contract and elongate repeatedly, and newly emerged miracidia swim in ‚Äúcharacteristic, long graceful curves.‚Äù The miracidia seem to have no attraction to host snails, bumping into the snails without attempting to penetrate and infect them. Rediae: The rediae are the second larval stage of the trematode life cycle, that develops from the miracidum and contains germ cells that develop into cercariae. The rediae are found in the second intermediate host, the snail. Rediae can range from 0.45 mm to 3 mm, and the larger rediae can contain up to 76 cercariae. Rediae and cercariae are found in all tissues of the host snail, but primarily in the gonads and the digestive gland., Rediae destroy the gonads, invade the hepatopancreas, damage it by 1) increased pressure from rapid growth, 2) active ingestion by the parasites, and 3) the disposition of parasitic wastes. Furthermore, parasites take up glycogen and lipids from the hepatopancreas. Cercariae: The cercariae measure 0.31 mm to 0.47 mm by 0.03 mm to 0.15 mm and live up to 48 hours in water. They have a tendency to infect snails that are at least 2.5 cm in length, though smaller snails have also been observed to shed cercariae. Cercariae shed intermittently by the thousands, entering the mantle cavity of the snail, and drifting out with the ‚Äúexhalent water current on the right side of the snail‚Äôs head.‚Äù, Cercariae from snails in brackish water of a low salinity were found to survive longer than snails in freshwater. Once cercariae are shed from the snail, it contracts repeatedly until it contacts a fish and penetrates under its skin within 30 seconds to 2 minutes. The cercariae penetrate further into the renal portal blood system, into the kidney and deeper tissues into the base of the tail. Penetrations sights are easily visible, as the skin, fins, and tails of the fish appear to be heavily eroded and damaged. Cercariae can also indirectly infect the fish, if the fish eat the cercariae orally. Metacercariae: The cercariae lose their tails in the act of penetration and encyst as metacercariae in almost any tissue of the salmonid fish. The new cyst wall is thin, transparent, and easily ruptured. If the cyst wall breaks, the metacercariae crawl out and re-encyst a few hours later in a tougher, larger cyst wall. While cysts can be found in all tissues of the fish, most encystment occurs in the kidneys and body muscles of the salmonid fish, and in the gills and fins of the non-salmonid fish. Cercariae penetrate less deeply in non-salmonid fish than in salmonid fish. Infected fish experience a decrease in their swimming activity and loss of equilibrium, and it is not uncommon for fish to have as many as 1000 to 2000 metacercariae in its tissues.,Baldwin, N.L., Millemann, R.E. and Knapp, S.E. (1967). J. Parasitol. 53:556‚Äì564. Importantly, metacercariae can be destroyed either by cooking or freezing infected fish. Snail: The Juga plicifera host snail is prevalent in coast streams and prefers large rocks, bridges, old planks, and debris on stream bed bottoms. It rarely migrates into shallow water. The infection of snails is high in comparison to the number of cercariae it sheds, since larval development continues slowly over a long period of time. Evidence of mixed infection varied between studies, but snails with large numbers of N. salmincola were not parasitized by other trematodes.Gebhardt, G.A., Milleman, R.E., Knapp, S.E., and Nyberg, P.A. (1966). J. Parasitol. 52:54‚Äì59. It was also found that monthly incidences of infection in snails ranged from 9‚Äì52% after examining over 3000 snails every month for 10 months, and that mature cercariae infected snails in a seasonal manner. Mature cercariae were more likely to infect snails in late April to November. Neorickettsia helmintheoca Neorickettsia helmintheoca is the etiological agent for salmon poisoning disease, found to be present in all stages of the trematode. It is 0.3 micrometers in size and a purple Giemsa stain indicates that it is Gram negative. Thus far, only canids are susceptible to disease by rickettsia and it is still uncertain how the rickettsia leave the trematode vector and reaches the host tissues. Experiments do show that the bacteria lead to necrosis of lymph follicles, ulceration, and severe hemorrhage in its host. Diagnostic tests # History of eating raw fish # Examination of feces for eggs of N. salmincola :Because only a few eggs are contained within each adult worm, patients with light infections are likely to have negative stool tests. Using trichrome stained preparations rather than formalin-ethyl acetate concentrates was more sensitive to identify cases. Management and therapy Praziquantel, 20 mg/kg body weight, three times a day. Praziquantel causes immobilized contraction of the worm, such that it can no longer grasp the intestinal walls, and can be eliminated from the body. Three 2-g doses of niclosamide or two 50 mg/kg doses of bithionol have also been effective when praziquantel was either not available or treatment was refused. However, a single 2-g dose of niclosamine was ineffective, as was 100 mg orally of mebendazole twice a day for three days. If diarrhea recurs, general supplements may also be needed in order to maintain electrolyte balance and meet nutritional requirements. Epidemiology Nanophyetus salmincola is limited to the geographic range of its intermediate hosts, primarily the US Pacific Northwest. Stream snails are found west of the Cascade Mountains in Oregon, north to the Olympic Peninsula in Washington, and in part of northern California. It is ‚Äúthe most common systemic trematode in the United States.‚ÄùGIDEON. www.gideononline.com Public health and prevention strategies *Cook fish thoroughly *Freeze fish for at least 24 hours *Fish away from known snail endemic places (otherwise make especially sure to cook fish thoroughly) *Take precautions when handling fish (prevent hand-to-mouth transmission of the metacercariae and be wary of hand contamination from heavily infected fish) *Check fish periodically for signs of infection, such as cysts or sites of irritation from penetration of the cercarariae (pertinent to fishing companies, fish markets, and restaurants) *Report sources of infected fish (bodies of water, fish companies, restaurants) *Eat raw fish only from trusted sources, such as reputable restaurants *Use molluscicides if can be practically used in smaller bodies of water *Keep dogs away from streams, making sure they defecate away from snail habitats References Category:Digenea Category:Parasitic helminths of fish ","title":"Nanophyetus salmincola"},{"id":"21740132","text":"right A cosmic-ray observatory is a scientific installation built to detect high-energy-particles coming from space called cosmic rays. This typically includes photons (high-energy light), electrons, protons, and some heavier nuclei, as well as antimatter particles. About 90% of cosmic rays are protons, 9% are alpha particles, and the remaining ~1% are other particles. It is not yet possible to build image forming optics for cosmic rays, like a Wolter telescope for lower energy X-rays, although some cosmic-ray observatories also look for high energy gamma rays and x-rays. Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHEC) pose further detection problems. One way of learning about cosmic rays is using different detectors to observe aspects of a cosmic ray air shower. Methods of detection for gamma-rays:GSFC Gamma-Ray Telescopes & Detectors * Scintillation detectors * Solid state detectors * Compton scattering * Pair telescopes * Air Cherenkov detectors For example, while a visible light photon may have an energy of a few eV, a cosmic gamma ray may exceed a TeV (1,000,000,000,000 eV). Sometimes cosmic gamma rays (photons) are not grouped with nuclei cosmic rays. History Cherenkov radiation (light) glowing in the core of a nuclear reactor. In comparison to this, the camera has captured a blue light from this effect in the water from the radiation given off by reactor, the cosmic-ray observatories look for this radiation coming from cosmic-rays in Earth's atmosphere \\"In 1952, a simple and audacious experiment allowed the first observation of Cherenkov light produced by cosmic rays passing through the atmosphere, giving birth to a new field of astronomy\\". This work, involving minimal instrument expense (a dustbin, a war-surplus parabolic mirror, and a 5 cm diameter photomultiplier tube), and based on a suggestion by Patrick Blackett, led ultimately to the current international multibillion-dollar investment in gamma ray astronomy. The Explorer 1 satellite launched in 1958 subsequently measured cosmic rays. Anton 314 omnidirectional Geiger-M√ºller tube, designed by George H. Ludwig of the State University of Iowa Cosmic Ray Laboratory, detected cosmic rays. It could detect protons with energy over 30 MeV and electrons with energy over 3 MeV. Most of the time the instrument was saturated; Sometimes the instrumentation would report the expected cosmic ray count (approximately thirty counts per second) but sometimes it would show a peculiar zero counts per second. The University of Iowa (under Van Allen) noted that all of the zero counts per second reports were from an altitude of 2,000+ km (1,250+ miles) over South America, while passes at would show the expected level of cosmic rays. This is called the South Atlantic Anomaly. Later, after Explorer 3, it was concluded that the original Geiger counter had been overwhelmed (\\"saturated\\") by strong radiation coming from a belt of charged particles trapped in space by the Earth's magnetic field. This belt of charged particles is now known as the Van Allen radiation belt. Cosmic rays were studied aboard the space station Mir in the late 20th century, such as with the SilEye experiment. This studied the relationship between flashes seen by astronauts in space and cosmic rays, the cosmic ray visual phenomena. In December 1993, the Akeno Giant Air Shower Array in Japan (abbreviated AGASA) recorded one of the highest energy cosmic ray events ever observed. In October 2003, the Pierre Augur Observatory in Argentina completed construction on its 100th surface detector and became the largest cosmic-ray array in the world. It detects cosmic rays through the use of two different methods: watching Cherenkov radiation made when particles interact with water, and observing ultraviolet light emitted in the earth's atmosphere. In 2018, the installation of an upgrade called AugerPrime has started adding scintillation and radio detectors to the Observatory. In 2010, an expanded version of AMANDA named IceCube was completed. IceCube measures Cherenkov light in a cubic kilometer of transparent ice. It is estimated to detect 275 million cosmic rays every day. Space shuttle Endeavor transported the Alphamagnetic Spectrometer (AMS) to the International Space Station on May 16, 2011. In just over one year of operating, the AMS collected data on 17 billion cosmic-ray events. Observatories and experiments There are a number of cosmic ray research initiatives.

History Located at 92 Frood Road in Downtown Sudbury, on the northwest corner of the intersection with College Street, the building was originally built in 1947 as a Royal Canadian Legion hall.Steelworkers Hall, Ontario Abandoned Places. Following several years of labour unrest in the city resulting from factional wars between Inco and Falconbridge mining employees over representation by the United Steelworkers of America or the Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, most workers eventually reconciled under the leadership of the Steelworkers. With the need to acquire a new home for the expanded union organization, representatives Don McNabb and Gib Gilchrist selected the hall, which the Legion had put up for sale due to declining membership. The union purchased the building, and moved into it on November 25, 1965.\\"Loss of Sudbury Union Hall A Great Tragedy, Historical Records Lost\\". USW Canada, September 19, 2008. The building was also considered a local institution by the wider community, often being rented out as a banquet and reception hall and as a meeting venue for community groups, political party nomination contests, fundraising events and other community functions. The building also housed some of Laurentian University's classes prior to the construction of the university's current campus in 1964. =Fire= Shortly after 2 a.m. on September 19, 2008, a fire broke out in the building's banquet room.\\"Steelworkers Hall goes up in flames\\" . Northern Life, September 19, 2008. Fire alarms first went off at 2:12 a.m. The Greater Sudbury Fire Service responded to the alarms, and the fire appeared to be under control by 6 a.m. However, an isolated pocket of the fire later erupted again, and by 9:30 a.m. the revived fire had reached the building's second floor offices. By 11:15 a.m., police ordered the evacuation of the nearby Sudbury Secondary School and Lansdowne Public School. Lansdowne students were bussed to Lo-Ellen Park Secondary School in the city's south end, while Sudbury Secondary students were moved to Lockerby Composite School. At the end of the school day, students who would ordinarily walk home from Lansdowne and Sudbury Secondary were bussed to St. David's Catholic Elementary School for vehicle pickup by their parents. With the fire remaining out of control, late that afternoon the decision was made to begin pulling down the building's walls in an attempt to contain the fire's spread. Excavators began creating a platform at around 6 p.m., and around 7:15 p.m. the excavators began to pull down the walls. The fire was not fully extinguished until approximately 4 a.m. on September 20, 26 hours after it began. Firefighters used more than one million gallons of water to douse the flames. United Steelworkers regional director Wayne Fraser issued a statement calling the fire a tragedy both for the union and the city as a whole: Ontario New Democratic Party leader Howard Hampton also issued a statement, speaking about the building's special place in the hearts of party members in the Sudbury area: Many of the union's records, including active files and archives comprising a major part of the city's documented labour history, were destroyed in the fire.\\"From historic landmark to ruins: ‚Äòsuspicious‚Äô fire destroys union hall; significant records lost in blaze\\".

The Greater Sudbury Police Service issued a request for information, offering a $1,000 reward for tips given to the city's CrimeStoppers line. The Steelworkers locals in Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie, as well as the head office of United Steelworkers International, later made additional donations which resulted in the reward being increased to $15,000 on September 29.

Known in the theater world, she had her first opportunity replacing her friend, the Mexican actress Isabela Corona when the actress gave birth to a child. Career She closed the shop and remained with the theater company and traveled to the United States, where she stayed until the early 1930s, helped by a young and struggling Cecil Kellaway, having small roles in the films of her cousins Dolores del R√≠o and Ram√≥n Novarro and as hat and make-up consultant for Marlene Dietrich, when the German actress arrived in Hollywood.Agras√°nchez Jr. (2001), p. 46 When she was called from Mexico and offered the role of Rosario in the film La Mujer del Puerto, it was Dietrich's style that inspired her in creating her character. Palma & Linda Christian in the film Tarzan and the Mermaids (1948). La Mujer del puerto (1934) became an instant success and Palma became a superstar, practically overnight. In the succeeding years, she was much in demand: her next movie was completely opposite to Rosario, playing the famous 17th century poet, playwright and nun Sor Juana In√©s de la Cruz; she returned to Hollywood to make two \\"Latin films\\", took a four-year break doing theater and in 1943 she was directed by her brother Julio Bracho in the classic melodrama Distinto amanecer (1943). She played Julieta, a frustrated wife during the day and a prostitute during the night. She appeared in other movies like El Rosario (1943), Los buitres sobre el tejado (1945) and La casa de la zorra (1945). In 1948, Palma participated in a Tarzan vehicle, Tarzan and the Mermaids (1948) starring Johnny Weissmuller. She travelled to Spain to perform in a play and during rehearsals she met actor Enrique D√≠az, whom she married. When she returned to Mexico, she was no longer considered a young leading lady and became specialized in character roles. In the 1950s she was in two classic Rumberas film productions and huge commercial successes starring Cuban superstar Nin√≥n Sevilla and directed by Alberto Gout, playing a mean brothel owner in Aventurera (1950) and a suffering wife in Sensualidad (1951). She filmed other movies like Mujeres sin ma√±ana (1950), with Carmen Montejo and Leticia Palma, and Eugenia Grandet (1952) with Marga L√≥pez. In 1955 she worked with Luis Bu√±uel in Ensayo de un crimen (1955). In the late 1950s, she appears next to Libertad Lamarque in La mujer que no tuvo infancia (1956); Mar√≠a F√©lix in Miercoles de ceniza, and Dolores del R√≠o in Where Are Our Children Going? (1958), among others. Although she worked in the Mexican film industry until the 1970s, Andrea Palma concentrated in television and theater since the late 1950s, including her weekly appearance as hostess of the popular series La novela semanal, based on literature classics, until her retirement in 1979 due to an illness. Her last role was with her niece and goddaughter Diana Bracho in the series √Ångel Guerra (1979).

The genus contains two species I. ritchiei, named after Dr. Alex Ritchie, a palaeoichthyologist and senior fellow of the Australian Museum, and I. sarahae, named after Sarah Long, daughter of its discoverer and describer, Dr. John A. Long. The genus is important in the study of early vertebrates as well-preserved fossilised embryos have been found in female specimens and ossified pelvic claspers found in males. This shows that viviparity and internal fertilisation was common amongst these primitive jawed vertebrates, which are outside the crown group Gnathostomata. In a study of fossil remains, comparison of the ontogeny of fourteen dermal plates from Compagopiscis croucheri and the more derived species Incisoscutum ritchiei suggested that lengthwise growth occurs earlier in the ontogeny than growth in width, and that dissociated allometric heterochrony has been an important mechanism in the evolution of the arthrodires, which include placoderms. These same fossil specimens also show that Incisoscutum was a predator, as muscle fibres from the tails of other placoderms have been found in the stomach regions. Fossils Three- dimensional uncrushed Incisioscutum fossils with remarkable soft tissue preservation were discovered within the Western Australian Gogo Formation, a warm, shallow-sea reef facies of Frasnian age. PalaeobiologyEmbryos= When Incisoscutum ritchiei was first described, bony plates of smaller arthrodires were discovered within the body cavity of two specimens. Due to their disorganised arrangement, posterior position behind the trunk shield, apparent gastric etching and the fact that one of the small arthodires was posterior facing relative to the adult, these bony plates were thought to represent the stomach contents of the adult Incisoscutum. However spurred by the discovery of preserved embryos inside the ptyctodonts Materpiscis attenboroughi and Australoptyctodus gardineri, the ‚Äòlast meals‚Äô of the Incisoscutum have now been reinterpreted as embryos, 5 cm in length, within pregnant adult females. The apparent gastric etching is now thought to be an early stage of ossification. The disarrangement is thought to be due to scattering as a result of the body cavity opening postmortem, worm casts throughout the body and surrounding matrix reveal that the fish carcass remained in an open environment after death. Furthermore, the lack of any taxa associated with the completely preserved delicate plates means that the arthrodires can now be excluded as stomach contents and interpreted as embryos. The discovery of embryos within Incisoscutum is of evolutionary importance as these fossils reveal that arthrodires had advanced reproductive biology and were able to give birth to live young. The Incisoscutum fossils show the oldest record of viviparity in any vertebrate, therefore internal fertilization and viviparity must have evolved in the vertebrates at least 380 million years ago and outside the gnathostomata. Viviparity in Incisoscutum and the ptyctodontids show that these placoderms were the first K-strategists in relation to breeding. They invested in rearing a smaller amount of eggs, rather than a huge spawn as their ancestors must have done. It is therefore likely that the warm reef environment of the Devonian Gogo Formation was stable and predictable, having a degree of ecological balance (for example hiding places for pregnant placoderms). This would have allowed the placoderms to invest more time and energy in producing and nurturing fewer, but more developed, offspring. =Pelvic claspers= Sexually dimorphic pelvic claspers have been found in male and female Incisoscutum fossil specimens. In males (WAM 03.3.28) the completely ossified clasper is a slender rod attached to a square basal plate that articulates directly with the pelvic girdle. This contrasts to modern sharks where the clasper articulates with a basipterygial cartilage element. The tip of the distal end has a small cap of dermal bone with small pits and denticles for clinging on to the female. The proximal part of the clasper expands into a plate with four foramina, two larger above two smaller. It is thought that this anatomy corresponds to the core of an erectile element as in extant sharks. Female Incisoscutum specimens differ from these male claspers and instead fossils have been found with a broad based pelvic plate that articulates with a posteriorly directed basipterygium, similar to modern sharks. The distal end has an articulation for an additional cartilaginous segment or series. Therefore, the difference in pelvic claspers between genders suggests that sexual dimorphism was already present in the arthrodires in the Devonian. Pelvic claspers have also been discovered in pyctodontid fossils suggesting homology. It is therefore suggested that pelvic claspers may characterise all of the pytodontids and arthrodires. As male and females have never been found in the same locality it is possible that Incisoscutum males and females inhabited different areas throughout most their life cycles, only coming together to mate, a behavior comparable to some extant sharks.

McPhee was reported to have built his \\"underworld empire\\" on drugs and robbery. He was jailed in 1978 for five years for robbery and served another five in 1986 for an armed raid. In 1990, he was cleared of involvement in a ¬£42,000 armed raid but was sentenced to eight years for his involvement in a ¬£200,000 drug deal in 1992. In 1997, McPhee was prosecuted for the killing of William \\"Worm\\" Toye, who was found stabbed to death in Perth Prison, where McPhee was serving time. A jury found the case not proven. In 1998, three months after his release from prison, McPhee was accused of the murder by strangulation of Chris McGrory, but the case was again found not proven. It was reported that a ¬£5,000 'contract' had been put out on his life. Police were said to be investigating one theory that McPhee had tried to muscle in on the drug trade controlled by former Irish terrorists. He had been responsible for negotiating between dealers in the North and the rest of England. Police also probed his links with a \\"plot to make Scotland the dogfighting capital of Europe\\"; and probed claims that he had been killed by one of two Glasgow gangster families. In May 2000, he was killed by a single shot to the head from a .22 rifle with telescopic sight outside his home in Guthrie Street, Maryhill, Glasgow, 500 yards from Maryhill Police Station, while his son watched.

It is then suggested that these organizations were \\"infiltrated by the CIA\\", eventually leading to the division of the then more unified African-American community, and again leading to the establishment of new violent street gangs. After this interviews with several current and former members, and relatives, of the Los Angeles street gangs the Crips and Bloods are shown, with changing contexts. Questions range from why the interviewees are involved in gang activity, to the problems and trouble with the gangs, to if and how the problems can be solved. A part of the film follows a number of mothers whose sons had been murdered by gang violence, with the mothers talking about their experiences and views.

It is located west of Hyde Park Road and south of Oxford Street inside the city limits of London, Southern Ontario, Canada. It is a Class 2 provincially significant wetland. Prior to 1967 the wetland was called \\"Byron Bog\\", having been at that time within the boundaries of the village of Byron, but it was renamed following the donation of the land by the \\"Sifton Construction Company\\". However, it had undergone a series of name changes before this time also, being variously named Foster's Bog and Redmond's Bog in the 1880s, after the occupants of the land at that time, and Spruce Bog in the 1890s. The name Byron Bog was used by the 1920s, but no record exists of its Native American name. The Sifton Bog is one of the most southerly acidic bogs in Canada. It contains a number of rare species including four types of carnivorous plants. Among the latter are the sundews Drosera intermedia and Drosera rotundifolia and the purple pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea. The central bog vegetation is dominated by Sphagnum and Chamaedaphne calyculata (leatherleaf), with a few short larches (Larix laricina) and black spruce (Picea mariana). Redmond's Pond in Sifton Bog The depression that houses the bog was created like many local geologic features, by the effects of glaciation. A depression in the Ingersoll Glacial Moraine was left by retreating glaciers. The result was a pocket with no drainage which developed into the Sifton Bog. The 0.2 hectare pond at the centre of the bog, Redmond's Pond, is the remnant of what would have originally been a larger 23 hectare water body, which has gradually filled with peat over the last 10000 years. The peat layer at the centre of the bog has been measured at 18 m (60 ft). Redmond's Pond is named after the Redmond family, who owned part of the land on which the bog is situated, between 1854 and 1900. The pond is less than 1.5 m (5 ft) deep, and has a pH of around 5. On the margins are surface growths of the carnivorous bladderwort Utricularia vulgaris and water lily Nuphar advena, with sparse growths of duckweed (Lemna minor) and water flax-seed (Spirodela polyrhiza). The bog was previously used as a commercial source of sphagnum moss, an alternative to cotton gauze. It was mined during the First World War to support the war effort and the needs of local hospitals. The Alder Buckthorn, a plant native to the bog, was harvested and used during the Second World War to produce gunpowder.

The plaques can be slightly warty (psoriaform) or scaly (eczema-like). ILVEN is caused by somatic mutations that result in genetic mosaicism. There is no cure, but different medical treatments can alleviate the symptoms. Classification ILVEN is a condition that normally only affects one side of the body (unilateral). Usually the left side of patients is affected. The condition is persistent and forms along characteristic lines. It usually appears on an extremity in infancy or childhood. Altman and Mehregan described six characteristic features of ILVEN: (1) early age of onset, (2) predominance in females (4:1 female-male ratio), (3) frequent involvement of the left leg, (4) pruritus, or \\"itchiness\\" (5) marked refractoriness to therapy, and (6) a distinctive psoriasiform and inflammatory histologic appearance. Genetics Most cases are sporadic, but a familial case, with the condition occurring in a mother and her daughter, has been described. It also has been proposed that activation of an autosomal dominant lethal mutation that survives by mosaicism may be the cause of the lesions. The mutated cells may survive in the due to proximity of normal cells. Another theory is that retrotransposable elements may be the cause of all skin conditions along the Lines of Blashko. Some dogs have a coat variation based upon a similar mechanism. The classification of the disease has much to do with the appearance and location of the lesions (phenotype characteristics). As this is a rare condition, it is possible that more than one genotype could cause a similar phenotype. Different genes have been implicated, but the number of patients studied in each case is very low. There is some evidence that interleukins 1 and 6, tumor necrosis factor Œ±, and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 are upregulated in ILVEN, similar to psoriasis. Histopathology -The plaques are characterized histologically by hyperkeratosis which is a thickening of the outer layer of skin. Hyperkeratosis is often associated with an abnormal amount of keratin production. Also characteristic is moderate acanthosis a thickening of the stratum spinosum with elongation of rete ridges. \\\\- Characteristic histologic feature is regular alternation of slightly raised parakeratotic areas without a granular layer (hypogranulosis) and slightly depressed orthokeratotic areas with prominent granular layer (hypergranulosis). Orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis is characterised by hyperkeratosis with non-nucleated cells. Parakeratotic hyperkeratosis is characterised by hyperkeratosis with nucleated cells. \\\\- The orthokeratotic area shows a basket-weave-pattern. \\\\- The dermis shows scattering of chronic inflammatory infiltrate (Munro's microabscess) sometimes giving a spongiform appearance. This is very similar to linear psoriasis, but it has been noted that the diseases are distinct entities by immunohistochemical analyses. Immunohistochemistry Patients with ILVEN with and without associated psoriasis, the number of Ki-67 positive nuclei, tended to be lower than is typically found in psoriasis. Additionally, the number of keratin-10 positive cells and HLA-DR expression was higher as compared to psoriasis. In ILVEN without associated psoriasis all T-cell subsets and cells expressing NK receptors were reduced as compared to psoriasis, except for CD45RA+ cells. In particular the density of CD8+, CD45RO+ and CD2+, CD94 and CD161 showed a marked difference between ILVEN without psoriasis and psoriasis itself. T cells relevant in the pathogenesis of psoriasis are markedly reduced in ILVEN without psoriasis as compared to psoriasis. Treatment Reported treatments include topical agents, dermabrasion, cryotherapy, laser therapy, and surgical excision. These therapies have a high failure rate because of incomplete relief of symptoms, scarring, or recurrence . Though similar in appearance, ILVEN will not respond to therapies known to affect psoriasis. ILVEN can be very difficult to live with but can be treated. The most effective method is full-thickness excision of the lesion. CO2 Laser Surgery can resurface the skin to give a flat, smoother and more normal appearance, but does not remove the lesion. History The condition later known as ILVEN was first described by Paul Gerson Unna in 1896. ILVEN appears very similar to psoriasis. However, it was not until 1971 that the disorder was described and clearly defined as a distinct entity by Altman and Mehregan in a case study of 25 patients. The Dupre and Christol described histopathological criteria in 1977. Epidemiology ILVEN usually appears in infancy or early childhood. The condition is very rarely begun in adulthood. ILVEN occurs predominantly in females (female-male ratio, 4:1) with no racial predominance.

Night of the Bandits of the Night is a 2005 musical comedy horror satire film written and directed by Travis Irvine with a budget of $5000. The independent film is the first feature film (commercial release) from Ohio University communications undergraduate students. It premiered at film festivals and select cinemas before being released on DVD, and is considered on its way to becoming a cult classic by at least one reviewer. Plot \\"Everyone knows someone who's had a run-in with an angry racoon. Some people even believe that racoons are smarter than people.\\" Outside the small rural town of Independence, college buddies Ty Smallwood (Lehr Beidelschies) and Zach (Colin Scianamblo) join a small group of college students visiting the Raccoon Creek Campground to have what they hope will be the best summer break of their lives. Their hopes are dashed when they have run-ins with frat guys, rednecks, hippies, bible students, and an inept set of camp counselors. Things go from bad to worse when they discover that maniacal raccoons have targeted the camp with an intention to wreak havoc on all humanity. When one camper is murdered, the rest seek revenge and retaliation.

Inspired during a 2004 Florida camping trip when he discovered several raccoons seeming to work in a coordinated effort scavenging his campsite, Irvine began to research \\"Man vs Nature\\" movies and raccoons in particular, learning that rabid raccoons would act in non-typical ways to attack other animals and children, and that they have stomach bacteria that could infect the brains of humans who eat them. While studying abroad in London, he developed the script that became the film. With the micro-budget of $5000, the film was shot in August 2005 in the Athens and Columbus areas of Ohio. Most cast and crew members have Ohio connections and producer Colin Scianamblo grew up with Irvine in Bexley. Tom Lyons, who played the role of The Mayor and who works at the OhioHealth media center spoke of Irvine and Scianmblo, \\"They‚Äôre both Bexley High School kids who interned for me about five or six years ago. The film also included members of the Ohio University comedy troupe \\"the Wrong Man group\\", and due to budget constraints, most cast were forced to play multiple roles. The commercial release of the film marked it as the first feature film to ever be successfully completed by Ohio University communications undergraduate students. The film has been remarked upon as being the first known feature in cinema history to star an assortment of real, dead, frozen animals, rather than live, trained, stuffed, animitronic, or puppet raccoons. The most important \\"effect\\" for the film was going to be the raccoons themselves, and Irvine consulted with experts at Ohio State University as he had initially planned on having raccoons prepared by a taxidemist. He was disappointed when he learned that it could cost hundreds of dollars just to have a single animal prepared, but the expert advised him of the usefulness of using frozen animals that could then be thawed, positioned, frozen, and thawed and then frozen for repeated repositionings, so production used seven legally donated frozen raccoons in this manner to create the killer coons. Release The film first premiered December 30, 2005 and had its festival debut at the annual Tromadance Film Festival on January 28, 2006, in Salt Lake City, Utah, which coincided with its first theatrical screening at the Drexal Gateway Theater in Columbus, Ohio, which was sponsored by the Drexel Theaters Group and the annual Columbus International Film and Video Festival. A subsequent festival was the 2007 Fright Night Film Festival in Louisville, Kentucky. Distribution rights to the film were acquired by Troma Entertainment in 2006 and they released it on DVD on August 26, 2008. Reception Jason Buchanan, reviewer for All Movie Guide wrote, \\"The laughs flow like rabies-infected blood in this gruesome horror comedy about a group of college campers besieged by a pack of killer raccoons\\". Peter Syslo of Infernal Dreams wrote, \\"Coons! turned out to be a very pleasant surprise. I have to admit that I was skeptical at first, due to the title and the subject matter, but I really think that these guys turned out a truly funny horror comedy\\", while Jamie Lisk of Cranked on Cinema wrote, \\"While lacking the polish of a Lloyd Kaufman opus, the mindset to offend is the same\\", \\"(Coons) will not appeal to everybody, that‚Äôs definitely for sure. I‚Äôm guessing that this film will end up with more detractors than admirers, but if you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôll enjoy the film‚Äôs get-up-and-go, especially if your personal get-up-and-go already got up and went two, four or six beers ago. Irvine should be commended for crafting a fast-paced, Benny- Hill-on-crack kind of crazy, slice of sophomore cinema, one that doesn‚Äôt shy away from offering its young male target demographic what it wants ‚Äì lots of blood, guts and silly, inane hilarity\\", and \\"Typical of indie films, some of the main actors have dual or triple roles here, and terrible fake moustaches are employed to help the audience separate them from each other. Dear god!\\" Reviewer Adam Jackson of The Lantern wrote, \\"The movie was overzealous in its use of human feces as a source of comedy\\", \\"Even the most sophomoric of frat guys could get tired of the movie's use of fart and pooping sounds as a supply of comedy\\", and \\"The film's special effects are, surprisingly, one the film's strongest assets\\". Ohio University's The Outlook reported that, \\"COONS! has already taken major steps to solidifying itself as a cult sensation\\", while The Lantern reports that the Drexel Theater showings were held over for an additional 3 weeks due to public demand for the film, and that they plan to launch midnight weekend movies starting March 3. When the film screened at the 2007 Fright Night Film Festival in Louisville, Kentucky, reviewer Troy H.

The stores sell groceries, home electronics, school supplies, and home supplies. Most also have a small indoor strip mall, usually featuring fast food. History L√≠der store signage until November 2011. L√≠der's origins lie in the 1893 establishment of Distribuci√≥n y Servicio (D y S) as an important distribution company. That company opened the Tres Montes general store in 1921. In 1957, the company opened Latin America's first supermarket in Santiago, Chile followed by the opening Ekono a discount supermarket in 1984. In 1995, the L√≠der hypermarket was born and was followed by the L√≠der Vecino neighborhood markets and L√≠der Express concepts in 2000 and 2003 respectively. The company added a membership warehouse store in 2007.Wal-Mart's Entry Into Chile Market Threatens Cuban Rum, by Pascale Bonnefoy, January 22, 2007, Global Post/The Huffington Post, access date 27-02-2009 The company was acquired by Walmart in 2009. Walmart purchased a 58.3% share in the D y S company with the remainder in the hands of the Ib√°√±ez Scott brothers.Wal-Mart makes follow-on offer for D&S;, Associated Press, 23-02-2009, access date 27-02-2009 In addition to this Walmart has followed up with an offer to purchase the remaining stock from the brothers. The company divested from any Cuban products like rum due to the embargo on Cuban products between the United States and any American company or subsidiary causing a consumer outcry and legal hurdle for Walmart since this violates Chilean free market and competition laws. L√≠der stores began selling Cuban products in addition to products from countries banned in the United States at half price to eliminate them from stock before the merger was complete. This caused a buying frenzy of Cuban rum that made headlines. This also caused an uproar from the public that was accustomed to certain products from certain countries. The largest retailing in the country no longer importing certain goods will certainly raise the price. Competitor Jumbo was inspired to begin a publicity campaign that they did not discriminate in their product selection by nationality. In fact, several members of the National Congress of Chile wrote a bill that would make it illegal to discriminate merchandise by country of origin. The Chilean authorities have stated that individual companies have wide latitude in determining what products they do and do not sell and why, however some in congress have insisted this move violates fair competition laws. All L√≠der stores are unionized and offer full benefits. The takeover by Walmart has made union leaders anxious due to Walmart's reputation for union busting. L√≠der stores also employ child labor, bagging groceries; they must however be in school, according to the Labor Code. The company competes with Cencosud's Jumbo and Santa Isabel supermarkets, SMU's Unimarc, as well as the smaller Tottus.Living In Chile, Retail Planet ReferencesExternal links *Official website Category:Hypermarkets Category:Walmart Category:Retail companies established in 1995 Category:Retail companies of Chile Category:Supermarkets of Chile Category:1995 establishments in Chile Category:2009 mergers and acquisitions ","title":"L√≠der"},{"id":"21740791","text":"Waxy keratosis of childhood (also known as \\"Kerinokeratosis papulosa\\") is a keratotic, flesh-colored papule that is either sporadic or familial, and may be generalized or segmental.

The company had notable brands under its umbrella, such as Bushmaster, DPMS, Remington and Marlin. History Robert Nardelli became CEO of Freedom Group in September 2010 as the North Carolina-based gun maker searched for a permanent CEO. In March 2012, Nardelli stepped down as CEO of Freedom Group and head of the operations and advisory business of Cerberus Capital Management and became adviser to Stephen Feinberg, the head and founder of Cerberus. In December 2012, citing the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting as \\"a watershed event that has raised the national debate on gun control to an unprecedented level,\\" Cerberus announced it would sell all of its investments in Freedom Group. The firm said it would retain a financial adviser to sell its interests in Freedom, and would return the proceeds to investors. The decision was made after a California pension board, a Cerberus stakeholder, announced it would dispose of all stakes it held in firearms manufacturers that make weapons banned by state law. As of February 2018, Cerberus still owned the company. On August 15, 2017, James Marcotuli announced his resignation as CEO, citing personal reasons. On October 25, the company announced that Anthony Acitelli would succeed Marcotuli. The families of nine victims and a teacher who was shot and survived in the Sandy Hook shooting, in which 20 children and six adult staff were fatally shot with a Bushmaster brand AR-15 style rifle, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Remington, a firearms wholesaler, and a firearms dealer, seeking a jury trial to recover unspecified damages. In 2016 the suit was dismissed by the Connecticut Superior Court citing the immunity provided to firearms manufacturers by the federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act of 2005. The suit was delayed by Remington's 2018 bankruptcy. On March 14, 2019 the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that the suit's wrongful marketing claim could proceed under Connecticut's Unfair Trade Practices Law. The Connecticut Supreme Court decision was \\"a significant development in the long-running battle between gun control advocates and the gun lobby\\" according to The New York Times and \\"groundbreaking\\" according to The Washington Post. Remington filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in March 2018, having accumulated over $950 million in debt. Remington exited bankruptcy in May, less than two months after filing for protection under Ch. 11 laws. Remington's quick exit from bankruptcy was due to a pre-approved restructuring plan that was supported by 97% of its creditors. On 28 July 2020, it filed again for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

As sheriff of Logan County, Chafin was a fierce opponent of unionization and received hundreds of thousands of dollars from coal mine operators in return for his violent suppression of the United Mine Workers union. Chafin's most notable anti-union measures came during the 1921 Battle of Blair Mountain, when he organized an effort to prevent armed miners from crossing through Logan County. He assembled a force of thousands of local townspeople, sheriff's deputies, and national guardsmen. His forces successfully prevented the advance of the miners until federal troops intervened and forced the latter to disperse. As a result of his actions, Chafin became a hero of the mine operators and an enemy of the miners. In 1924, Chafin was arrested in connection with moonshining and sentenced to two years in prison. After his release, he became an important figure in the Democratic Party of West Virginia, and a lobbyist for the coal industry. In 1936, he moved to Huntington, West Virginia, where he was a wealthy and well-known figure until his death in 1954.http://www.wvculture.org/history/thisdayinwvhistory/0809.html Early life Chafin was born on June 26, 1887, near the town of Kermit in present- day Mingo County, West Virginia, the sixth of eleven children. His father, Francis Marion Chafin, was the sheriff of Logan County, and Chafin grew up in the town of Logan. (He was related to the Hatfield family of West Virginia-- his great aunt Levisa \\"Levicy\\" Chafin was the wife of Anderson Hatfield). For two years he studied in the preparatory department of Marshall College ‚Äì without taking college courses ‚Äì but did not graduate.Lee, p. 88 He also attended the Mountain State Business College, before teaching at the Dingress School in Mingo County. In 1905, Chafin married Mary Mounts, with whom he eventually had 10 children, eight of whom survived to adulthood. Three years later, in 1908, Chafin was appointed the tax assessor of Logan County. In 1912, Chafin was elected sheriff of Logan County for the first time, and in 1920 he was elected county clerk as well. As sheriff After becoming sheriff of Logan County, Chafin became known as \\"the boss\\" of Logan County or \\"the czar\\", and its \\"best known citizen\\". His authority extended so far into every aspect of public life that he reportedly controlled every judge and jury in the county. According to Howard B. Lee, the former Attorney General of West Virginia, Chafin was so powerful that \\"no schoolteacher was employed without his approval.\\"Lee, p. 89 Chafin's vast power attracted the attention of mine operators, who paid him to keep the unions out of Logan County. The operators bribed Chafin with large payments, and paid many of the expenses of the sheriff's department. While the exact payments to Chafin are unknown, a special commission ordered by Governor John Cornwell found that he received a payment of at least $32,700 per year in return for keeping the union out of Logan County.Gleason, p. 97 Other estimates of the bribes paid to Chafin range as high as $61,571 in 1921,Lee, p. 92 and other evidence suggests the possibility of even higher figures. The historian Robert Shogan reports that although Chafin's annual salary was only $3,500 per year, his net worth by 1921 was in excess of $350,000, suggesting that he received bribes of at least $50,000 annually.Shogan, p. 171-172 The operators also directly paid the salary of at least forty of Chafin's deputies, ensuring control over the department and favorable treatment.Savage, p. 82 The bribes from the mine owners did indeed result in favors from Chafin; Chafin stationed one of his deputies at every railway station in Logan County to \\"guard against union organizers\\". Upon suspicion that someone entering the county was a union organizer, Chafin's deputies would either force him to leave, arrest him, or beat him.Lee, p. 90 In one case, Chafin mistook J. L. Heiser, the Chief Clerk of the West Virginia Department of Mines, for a union organizer, then threatened him with a gun, hit him over the head with a blackjack, and forced him to leave the county.Gleason, pp. 99-100 After the incident, realizing his mistake, Chafin paid Heiser $1,000 in compensation, but never faced any other consequences for his actions.Lee, p. 91 =Shooting= Chafin's anti-union activities did successfully keep the United Mine Workers out of Logan County, but they also aroused the anger of UMW officials. Chafin also established a record of violent and unpleasant confrontations with union officials outside of Logan County. In one such incident in September 1919, Chafin entered the office of the UMW in Charleston, West Virginia while he was \\"drunk, armed and very belligerent.\\"Lee, pp. 92-93 William Petry, the vice-president of the local union, asked Chafin to leave, but Chafin responded by brandishing a revolver. Petry then shot Chafin in the chest with a 22-caliber pistol. Petry was later cleared of criminal wrongdoing on the grounds that his action was self-defense,Shogan, p. 173 but he expressed no remorse about the shooting and later remarked \\"That's what happens when a man carries a toy pistol. That goddamned son of a bitch is liable to get well. I should have had my old 'forty-four.'\\"Lee, p. 93 In a second shooting incident, a miner walked into Chafin's sheriff office in Logan and, without a word, shot him in the chest. Chafin walked the two blocks to Logan General Hospital with a bullet lodged in his chest two inches from his heart. In a third incident, a disgruntled constituent walked into his office, with a gun drawn and reportedly said \\"Don Chafin, I'm gonna' shoot you dead.\\" Chafin reached into his desk drawer and pulled out a pistol of his own, and said, \\"Go ahead. We'll hop into Hell together.\\" The man left without firing a shot. Battle of Blair Mountain Chafin's conflict with the unions became most pronounced during the Battle of Blair Mountain in August and September 1921. A strike, with its beginning in 1920, had led to increasing violence throughout southern West Virginia, including the Battle of Matewan. The growing violence led to a declaration of martial law in 1921, and a Congressional investigation into the circumstances in the area began, but it accomplished little.Savage, pp. 58-63 Then Sid Hatfield, the miners' hero from the Battle of Matewan, was killed on August 1 by Baldwin-Felts agents on the steps of the McDowell County Courthouse in Welch. After his murder and funeral, tensions erupted in southern West Virginia.Lee, pp. 70-71 =The miners assemble= Shortly after Hatfield's death, a large group of miners began to assemble south of Charleston along Lens Creek, and prepared to march south to Mingo County, and free their fellow miners who had been imprisoned under the martial law decree for violent acts. The path of the march would take the miners directly across Logan County, causing fear for Chafin and his backers. Chafin declared \\"No armed mob will cross Logan County\\", and prepared to stop the miners as they crossed Blair Mountain.Savage, p. 77 Chafin's pronouncements and preparations were regarded with contempt by the miners, who took up the cry, \\"We'll hang Don Chafin to a sour apple tree.\\"Savage, pp. 76-77 One of the leaders of the miners, Ed Reynolds, later testified that a central aim of the march was \\"to kill Sheriff Don Chafin\\". Faced with the oncoming miner army, Chafin put into place plans he had been forming since early summer. Chafin had formed a small army of several hundred volunteers, composed of his deputies, mine guards, and members of the Logan County middle class, and had begun to train them in June. He established large weapons caches, including a stockpile of machine guns, and erected breastworks on the slopes of Blair Mountain. At around 2 a.m. on August 25, Chafin turned on the fire siren in the town of Logan, calling together his army. By morning, 700 members of his volunteer army were assembled on the slopes of Blair Mountain.Savage, p.. 81-83 In addition to his land forces, Chafin established a small air force, composed of three biplanes that he rented from private owners for use in reconnaissance.Shogan, p. 198 After initial skirmishes on August 25 and August 26 between Chafin's forces and the miners, UMW officials managed to defuse the tensions in the area, and convinced the miners to go home. Chafin recalled his troops and told them \\"You have been in defense of our rights. Logan County will never forget it.\\"Savage, p. 90 Before the miners dispersed, however, the West Virginia State Police attempted to arrest a group of their leaders, and the attempt escalated into a shootout in which several miners died.Savage, p. 102 Suddenly the rebellion reignited, and it became clear that a major battle was coming. =The battle= Members of the UMW display a bomb dropped by Chafin's biplanes Chafin reorganized and enlarged his forces, and volunteers from around the state arrived to join his army. The Governor of West Virginia, Ephraim Morgan, also helped Chafin recruit men to join his forces, and sent an unofficial national guard unit to join him. Governor Morgan then named William Eubanks as a colonel of the National Guard, and ordered him to take command of the forces from Chafin. Chafin officially passed command to Eubanks, but \\"the army remained Chafin's in popular perception.\\"Savage, pp. 116-117 As it became clear that battle was imminent, and Chafin printed leaflets for his biplanes to drop on the miners, ordering them one last time to disperse. The effort produced no results, and both sides prepared for the conflict.Savage, p. 120 Not long after the leaflets were dropped, the battle \\"erupted in hot warfare.\\" Chafin served as Eubanks's second in command, and helped organize forces. The next day, September 1, as the fighting intensified, Chafin left the front lines to establish a second line of defense around the town of Logan in case the miners broke through the first line.Savage, p. 125 That same day, Chafin also equipped his biplanes with pipe bombs and tear gas, which they dropped on the miners, though they inflicted no serious casualties. =Aftermath= The next day, September 2, the battle ended when federal troops under General Harry Hill Bandholtz arrived. Chafin and his army went home, and Chafin became \\"a hero in the eyes of the coal operators\\" for his role in stopping the march.Savage, p. 164 While the operators regarded Chafin as a hero, the miners placed the blame for the bloodshed on Chafin.Lee, p. 103 Regardless of his role in the events, Chafin remained sheriff after the battle and began to round up and arrest a number of the leaders of the miners. While some of the top leaders arranged to be arrested in other jurisdictions to stay out of Chafin's hand, others including Frank Keeney, a top UMW official, and Bill Blizzard, the so-called general of the miners, surrendered to Chafin and were put in jail in Logan County.Lee, pp. 105-106 The trials eventually were transferred to other jurisdictions, and the prisoners passed out of Chafin's hands without incident. Politics and arrest After the battle, Chafin went back to his normal work as sheriff of Logan County and \\"became more arrogant\\", believing his position to be unassailable. He became involved in a number of illegal ventures, including a moonshining operation.Lee, pp. 116-117 He also became increasingly important within the West Virginia Democratic party, due to his celebrity status after the battle. He was frequently present in the state capitol, and attended the 1924 Democratic National Convention as a member of the West Virginia delegation. A few months later, Chafin's illegal activities led to his arrest. One of his deputies, Tennis Hatfield, was arrested for violation of the Volstead Act, and he implicated Chafin at his trial.Lee, p. 117 Chafin was tried and convicted of violation of the Volstead Act at the federal courthouse in Huntington, West Virginia on October 14, 1924. He was given the maximum sentence of two years in prison, and ordered to pay a fine of $10,000. The judge in the case also took special precautions to protect the witnesses against Chafin, due to his potentially violent nature. Chafin appealed the verdict, but it was upheld in April 1925, and he was sent to the federal penitentiary in Atlanta. He served part of his term before being paroled back to Logan County. While Chafin was in prison, he lost much of his influence in Logan County, and his political opponents took power.Lee, p. 119 After his release from prison, Chafin moved to Charleston and retained some of his influence in the Democratic Party of West Virginia while lobbying for the coal industry.Lee, p. 118 Later life In 1936, Chafin moved to Huntington, where he purchased a number of properties including the Guaranty Bank, on top of which he built a penthouse as his home. He lived in semi- retirement there for the rest of his life.Lee, p. 121 In his later days, Chafin trained coon dogs, and was known as \\"one of Huntington's wealthiest men\\" and a \\"familiar figure\\" in the city. He suffered several heart attacks in his later life, and eventually died on August 9, 1954 in a Huntington hospital after a surgical procedure. Legacy His house at Logan, known as the Chafin House, served as the Logan Public Library for many years and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994.

SCC has been ranked 4th in the list of America's best community colleges. It is one of the three high schools in the Macon area, including Franklin High School and Union Academy. This program was designed to enhance and enrich a student's educational career by providing the opportunity to earn both a high school diploma and associate degree. Opening The school opened without a dedicated building and found its home at the former Cartoogechaye Elementary School in 2005. In 2007 MEC's staff and students were relocated in 2007 to the new SCC Macon Campus. Since then, a new building was dedicated for the school's students and staff to separate the Early College from the Community College attendees. This new building was located directly across the street from the SCC campus and closer to the Macon County Public Library. The school has received much praise since its introduction to the area, primarily in regard to the accelerated educational tract including college credit, small class sizes, and enriching environment. Student learning devices While previous years included sole use of laptops, current administration of the schools allow for use of iPads as well as laptops for classes that are incompatible with the more mobile solution. In 2019 no charge has been given to students, however, students in earlier years have been charged $25 per student due to computer repair expenses and new equipment for the computers. These laptops were supplied by the 1:1 Laptop Pilot charity program. iPads were supplied by the Macon County School system in order to match other high schools in the area.

Biography Cheesman was born in Brigham City, Utah and was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). His parents died while he was still young and he oversaw his own education. He received a degree in education from San Diego State University. In California, he was also a public school teacher, and he later worked as a seminary teacher for the LDS Church. During the Korean War, he served as a chaplain in the United States military. In 1944, he married Millie Foster, with whom he had six children.BYU library electronic catalog entry for \\"Paul R. Cheesman [electronic resource]\\" (2004) Later, as president of the Foster Corporation, Cheesman was heavily involved in Central America, where he developed a collection and strong interest in pre-Columbian archaeology. Cheesman taught in BYU's Department of Religious Education from 1963 to 1986. He received his master's degree in 1965 and doctorate in 1967, both in Religious Education at BYU. For a time, he served as director of scripture studies and director of Book of Mormon studies in BYU's Religious Studies Center. Cheesman was known for research of correlations between the Book of Mormon and pre-Columbian American discoveries. His stated desire was to promote Latter-day Saint faith: > Archaeological evidences which support The Book of Mormon do not convert, > but we would hope that these thought-provoking discoveries might inspire and > excite the reader to the point where they would want to study The Book of > Mormon with real intent and gain a testimony of its truth. After retiring, Cheesman and his wife moved to St. George, Utah. Cheesman served in various callings in the LDS Church. He served as a Bishop, District president, twice as Stake president, and as president of the Louisiana Baton Rouge Mission from 1980 to 1983. After retiring from BYU, he was director of the church's New York Visitors Center. In New York, Cheesman suffered a massive heart attack and returned to Utah for surgery, when he died in 1991. Criticism Cheesman's book Ancient American Indians: Their Origins, Civilizations and Old World Connections has been criticized as a poor work of scholarship, most especially by such men as Martin H. Raish and John L. Sorenson who also believe that the Book of Mormon is an ancient work and thus feel that such shoddy scholarship hurts more than it helps a true understanding of the book. William J. Hamblin has said of a 1985 work by Cheesman on ancient writing on gold plates that it should be \\"used with caution\\".\\"Sacred Writing on Metal Plates in the Ancient Mediterranean\\". In FARMS Review, Vol. 19, Issue 1, note 10 Publications Cheesman's most recognized publications are about ancient America's relationship to the Book of Mormon. His master's thesis was notable for bringing to light the previously unknown 1832 account of the First Vision, Joseph Smith's first recorded account that dates to 1832.       * * =Illustrated books=   Notes External links  * * The Paul R.

Early life Reuben Booth was born in Newtown, Connecticut. When he was quite young, his family moved to Kent, Connecticut. His father was a man of considerable attainments in science, but in moderate circumstances. He needed the assistance of his son in his business of wool-carding to support the family. Reuben Booth was thus employed in this business until he was about seventeen years old, when, with his father's consent, he commenced preparatory studies of a collegiate course. In 1813, he entered the sophomore class in Yale College. Shortly afterwards, he received notice of his father's death, which came by drowning. He hastened home and expected to abandon his studies, but friends in Kent loaned him the money required for him to complete his studies. He graduated in 1816. Immediately after graduation, he commenced the study of law. A year into his law studies, he was also employed as an instructor in the academy in Danbury. He was admitted to the Bar in 1818 and opened an office to practice law in Danbury. Political career In 1822, Booth was elected a representative of Danbury to the General Assembly of Connecticut. In the same year, he was appointed judge of probate for the district of Danbury, an office he remained in until 1835. In 1830, he was elected state senator. In 1844 he was elected Lieutenant Governor of Connecticut, serving for two one-year terms while Roger Sherman Baldwin was governor, from May 1, 1844 to May 6, 1846. His policy was always conservative. Booth died at Danbury August 14, 1848 of the dysentery, after an illness of little more than two days. On Friday, August 11, he was engaged in a trial of a case before the court, which he argued with his usual ability, and his death occurred on the following Monday. He was a member of the Episcopalian Church during the latter part of his life, and was buried in the burying-ground of the Episcopalians in Danbury.

It was planned for the track to open the album, but \\"No Line on the Horizon\\" was chosen instead. The song had several different titles during the recording sessions, including \\"Chromium Chords\\" and \\"Tripoli\\", and was the result of a fusion of two different songs during the recording sessions. Writing and recording \\"Fez ‚Äì Being Born\\" was first developed in the No Line on the Horizon recording sessions with producer Rick Rubin in 2006. The symphonic guitar sound from the experimental \\"Fez\\" piece, the opening minute of the song, was created by guitarist the Edge during the recording of \\"The Saints Are Coming\\" with Green Day. When the band decided to work with producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois, most of the material from the Rick Rubin sessions was shelved. Lanois found the part and edited it into a tempo, adding in one of the beats developed by Eno before playing it for the band. After hearing the piece, Bono noted that \\"it was almost something coming to life. Like a flower opening or coming into the world.\\" Another song, \\"Being Born\\", was being worked on concurrently. The guitar in this was developed through a Death by Audio distortion box; the idea to use it was suggested to the Edge by Ben Curtis of the Secret Machines. Lanois suspected that the slow-tempo \\"Fez\\" would work well alongside the more energetic \\"Being Born\\". He edited \\"Being Born\\" so that it would be in the same key as \\"Fez\\" and placed the two together, creating the one song. At this time it was provisionally titled \\"Chromium Chords\\", and it was later renamed \\"Tripoli\\" before the band changed the name again to \\"Fez ‚Äì Being Born\\". Note: Subscription required to access the video. The \\"let me in the sound\\" chant from the song \\"Get on Your Boots\\" was edited into the \\"Fez\\" section at a low volume, serving as the song's opening lyric. By June 2008, the song was almost finished. \\"Fez ‚Äì Being Born\\" was originally planned to open the album, but the band eventually decided that the higher-energy \\"No Line on the Horizon\\" was a better selection. Composition The sounds of a Moroccan marketplace were layered into the \\"Fez\\" section of the song. The New York Times described it as being composed of \\"ricocheting patterns\\". The Irish Independent called the song No Line on the Horizon's \\"most jarringly experimental moment\\". Live performances \\"Fez ‚Äì Being Born\\" appeared in some 2011 dates of the U2 360¬∞ Tour, as an interlude between the performances of \\"Miss Sarajevo\\" and \\"City of Blinding Lights\\". Appearances in other media \\"Fez ‚Äì Being Born\\" is the sixth track in the Anton Corbijn film Linear, based on a story by Corbijn and Bono where a Parisian traffic cop travels across France and the Mediterranean Sea to visit his girlfriend in Tripoli. During the sequence, the officer (Sa√Ød Taghmaoui) is partway through his journey when he reaches a town. He stops for lunch and enters a small caf√© which, with the exception of the waitress (Lizzie Brocher√©), is devoid of people. He has meal and turns his attention to the room's television, where the next track, \\"Magnificent\\", begins. Reception Rolling Stone called it the \\"least linear song on the album\\", describing it as \\"a highway ride in flashback images dotted with Bono's wordless yelps and the descending ring of the Edge's guitar.\\" Reviewer David Fricke felt that the closing verse was a metaphor for the band's songwriting process. Q thought that its location in the final third of the track list alongside \\"Breathe\\" helped to give the album \\"its twist in the tail.\\" Blender enjoyed the song, stating it \\"rolls along on the melodic pointillism of minimalist composer Steve Reich.\\" Allmusic was disappointed with the song, believing that the band had overworked the track to the point where \\"the ideas collapse like a pyramid of cards.\\" NME disliked the song, stating it \\"isn't nearly as daring as it thinks it is, merely a meandering slice of ambient doodling before kicking into gear as yet another mid-paced rocker.\\" Spin felt that Bono's presence on the track was \\"mostly phonetic\\", noting that it seemed like he was \\"unsure of how to express himself in a musical context.\\" Uncut felt that some of the song's elements were overwhelmed by the band's playing.
