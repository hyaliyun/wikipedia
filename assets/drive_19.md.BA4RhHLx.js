Together with Place du Canada, the area is just over or of manicured and protected urban parkland bordered by Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard to the south, Peel Street to the west, Metcalfe Street to the east and Dorchester Square Street to the north. The square is open to the public 24 hours a day and forms a focal point for pedestrian traffic in the city. Until the creation of Place du Canada in 1967, the name \\"Dominion Square\\" had been applied to the entire area. Land acquisition to build the square began in 1872 and the site was inaugurated in 1878, though it was not thoroughly completed until 1892. The square has four statues that were originally arranged in the form of a Union Jack. In 2010, $14-million was spent on a redesign, with the removal of a flower stand on the southwest corner, all monuments refurbished, new street furniture added and a lighting scheme which has greatly improved the look of the square after dark. As a nod to the fact that it was once a cemetery, small crosses have been embedded in the walkways. In addition, some lights are pointed to shine on the foliage of the many trees, allowing for an interesting nocturnal green glow in the summer. A planned renovation of Place du Canada has begun with renovations to the John A. Macdonald monument and the Cenotaph. A further renovation of Dorchester Square Street (including the bus/taxi parking area, subterranean garage entrance and exit and the kiosk) is planned, and it is possible that the square may be expanded with Dorchester Square Street converted for pedestrian use. Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral from interior of Dorchester Square History Dominion Square, ca. 1900 Dominion Square in 1927 and City Plan 1907 Up until 1854, the square was little more than a public green and an informal meeting place. Much of it was used for the Catholic Sainte-Antoine Cemetery, a hastily arranged cemetery for the victims of the 1851 Cholera Epidemic. In that year, the bodies were exhumed and moved to Notre-Dame-des- Neiges Cemetery on the northwestern side of Mount Royal. In 1869, St. George's Anglican Church was erected at the corner of Peel and De la Gaucheti√®re. It spawned the construction of several other Protestant churches and cathedrals in and around Dominion Square, which was beginning to take form as a dividing line between the estates and suburbs of the northwest and the retail and commercial areas to the east and southeast. The 1870s provided several massive projects which made the green a central meeting point and prestige address that formalized the use of the square. Land acquisition began in 1872 and the park took its present form in 1878. Simultaneously, the Catholic Archdiocese began construction of Mary, Queen of the World Cathedral across from the southeast corner of the square. On the western side of the square, the Windsor Hotel was completed by 1878. With such prestigious construction and massive human traffic, the square became a vital component of the urban environment and a focal point for transit between the office and commercial sectors and the retail and suburban sectors. In 1889, the Canadian Pacific Railway constructed Windsor Station on the south side of De la Gaucheti√®re Street, opposite St. George's Cathedral. This further increased the importance of the square as a major focal point. Later construction would involve the demolition of the original YMCA Building (1851) on the east side of the square in order to allow the construction of the first portion of the Sun Life Building at the corner of Metcalfe Street and Dorchester Boulevard, which would grow to take up the entire eastern side of the square by 1931. In 1929, the northern side of the square was graced with the Dominion Square Building, designed as an integrated shopping arcade and office tower. The arcade was specifically designed to draw pedestrian traffic between the square and St. Catherine St. Additional construction after the Second World War saw the development of the Laurentian Hotel across from the southwest corner of the square. In 1960, the original southern section of the Windsor Hotel was demolished in order to build the CIBC Tower. The 1960s also saw major developments as Dominion Square became the central orienting point for the new downtown of modernist skyscrapers. As such, a skywalk was erected on the south side of the square, across De la Gaucheti√®re to Place du Canada and the Chateau Champlain hotel. In 1967, Dominion Square was divided into two parts, the southern portion being renamed Place du Canada while the northern portion retained the name Dominion Square. After the death of Ren√© L√©vesque in 1987, Dorchester Boulevard was renamed in his honour and Dominion Square was renamed \\"Dorchester Square\\", after Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester, who supported the rights of French speakers in British North America. Monuments and their significance There are four principal monuments in Dorchester Square, originally arranged to form an equilateral cross with the 'Camellienne' (a multi-purpose kiosk that currently houses a snack bar) at the northern point. However, the cross form was altered first when the Lion of Belfort fountain was disconnected and moved further south along Metcalfe Street. Later, a florist was established at the southwestern corner, further altering the original layout of the square. Under the current renovation plan, the Robert Burns statue will be moved further north along Peel Street and the florist kiosk removed entirely. The square, in name and content, is a testament to the entrepreneurial and industrial spirit of Montreal's Victorian Era anglophone business community. = Tribute to Sir Wilfrid Laurier = Tribute to Sir Wilfrid Laurier, 1953, Joseph-√âmile Brunet Beginning from the southern side of the square, the first monument is the tribute to Sir Wilfrid Laurier, constructed in 1953 by Joseph-√âmile Brunet. Laurier faces south across Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard towards the United States. Laurier was a proponent of an early free-trade agreement with the United States and wanted to develop a more continental economic orientation. Also, as Canada's first French-Canadian prime minister, he faces off against the tribute to Sir John A. Macdonald, across the street in what is now Place du Canada. Macdonald is enshrined in a stone baldachin emblazoned with copper reliefs of the various agricultural and industrial trades. Laurier stands with the shelter of the massive trees which characterize the square, a granite relief of the provinces created and united under his administrations opposite a bas-relief of man and woman sharing the harvest. Laurier also stands with his back facing the back of the Boer War Memorial‚ÄîLaurier had been against the war. = Boer War Memorial = Close-up of the only equestrian statue in the City of Montreal The Boer War Memorial faces north, towards the cross atop Mount Royal, which would have been visible from the square up until 1929. It is the only equestrian statue in Montreal, and atypically, is not mounted, but restrained. The Boer War was widely unpopular in Quebec society, viewed as an imperial war. Prime Minister Laurier opposed the war, but ultimately compromised with the proposal for militia and volunteers en lieu of conscription. The war was disastrous for most of its first half, and the losses significant enough to anticipate the losses of middle and upper-class men during the First World War. Around the base of the statue, there are copper reliefs and the names of each battle. The memorial is in the centre of the square and forms the central point in the cross arrangement of the monuments. = Lion of Belfort  Robert Burns statue = Close-up of the Robert Burns statue, dedicated to the Scottish poet The Robert Burns Statue forms the western point in the cross and is placed at the western entrance to the square. Facing west, Burns is a tribute to the industrialists and financiers of Montreal's Scottish community. Burns represents the socially conscious and refined romantic ideal of the community during the High Victorian Era. Additionally, Burns looks out towards the infinite expanse of Western Canada, opened up by the rail and finance managed by the elites of the community. Function within the urban environment Intersection of Peel Street and Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard from the southern side of the square, looking at sunset through the Peel cluster of skyscrapers. Most prominent here is the former Lavalin Building Dorchester Square and Place du Canada share a variety of functions within the urban environment of downtown Montreal. In fact, the variety of functions performed and their inter- relations is what necessitates careful consideration of the square and which prohibits reckless redevelopment and strict regulation regarding new development. = Traffic diffusion and intermodal transit = Functionally speaking, Dorchester Square and Place du Canada are traffic diffusers, diffusing not only traffic within a mode, but creating an 'environmental lobby' from which traffic may change modes in addition to orientation. With this in mind, consider that the area is accessed by the city's two principal train stations, (Windsor Station and Central Station), as well as by four metro stations and is accessed by the three densest portions of Underground City, Montreal. In addition, the area is adjacent to both the Ville-Marie Expressway and the Bonaventure Expressway, which allows a diffusion of automobile traffic in multiple routes towards the square and plaza. Finally, within the next few years, a direct rail link to Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport will be established, delivering airport traffic directly into this hub. The second element of this traffic-diffusion component is the ability to easily and effectively transfer between transit nodes. The high concentration of automobile parking spaces in the downtown core is focused on the square (which has a parking garage under it, accessed by Peel, Metcalfe and Dominion Square streets) and provides immediate access‚Äîvia the square and plaza‚Äîto the variety of public transit modes arranged around the area. To the east is the Place Ville Marie corridor of the Underground City, which carries pedestrian traffic from the Roddick Gates at McGill University on Sherbrooke Street all the way south to Place Bonaventure. At Place Bonaventure, pedestrian traffic is diverted both further east, to Square Victoria, the Quartier international de Montr√©al, Tour de la Bourse, Old Montreal, Place d'Armes and the Palais des congr√®s de Montr√©al. Traffic diffused through this corridor to the west can be connected to the Terminus Centre-Ville (AMT) at 1000 de la Gaucheti√®re or further along to the Chateau Champlain, the Place du Canada Building, Windsor Station, 1250 Ren√©-L√©vesque, Bell Centre and Lucien-L'Allier (Montreal Metro). = Interconnection with the Underground City = Pedestrian traffic diffused from this corridor to the north and northwest can bring pedestrian as far as Drummond and Sherbrooke at rush- hours, but mostly serves the interconnected malls and department stores near McGill College Avenue, such as the Centre Eaton, Place Montreal Trust, 1501 McGill College, Les Cours Mont-Royal, Place de la Cath√©drale, Complexe Les Ailes (Montreal), and several other connected shopping malls. As such, via the north of the square, both Peel and McGill metro stations are accessible to the square. The function of the square and plaza as environmental and inter-modal lobby is enhanced by what is not connected to the Underground City and the various modes of transit which circle the square. The Sun Life Building's principal vault lies below street level at the very centre of the building's foundation, therefore requiring underground traffic pass around the square or come outside to cross it. The same situation is repeated by the cluster of skyscrapers and prominent buildings near the intersection of Peel and Ren√© L√©vesque Boulevard. The Peel Cluster includes several prominent buildings, including the Tour CIBC, Place Laurentienne, the Windsor Hotel and the Centre Sheraton. In addition, the Dominion Square Building is best accessed via the square and is similarly unconnected. = Social traffic = The idea of the square being a type of traffic shortcut (best understood by seasoned Montrealers) in addition to the presence of vital, yet unconnected buildings directly on the square induces social traffic through the square and plaza. Particularly in good weather, the area is a massive generator of social inter- traffic. Its presence and position allows for exceptional use by every social and cultural group within the city. Moreover, as both the square and plaza are legally defined as being open to the public at all times, even in adverse weather conditions, the area is always being used in its intended function. The social inter-traffic component is best witnessed in summer months, when all sorts of Montrealers combine with the tourist element. The central Quebec Tourism bureau for Montreal is located at the Dominion Square Building, and the square is specifically designed to handle specialty vehicles such as limousines, sightseeing buses and motor coaches. Throughout the day, tourists and office workers mingle with students and artists. The kiosk located at the northern end of the square, locally referred to as a Camillienne‚Äîin reference to Montreal mayor Camillien Houde, who ordered their construction as Depression Era make-work projects‚Äîis a snack bar and caf√© open primarily in the summer. Additionally, the northwestern portion of the square, on Peel north of Cypress, is dominated by a variety of restaurants, bars, clubs, bistros and taverns. It should not be surprising that the square and plaza are filled by thousands of people around noontime, enjoying their lunch break in an area where sunshine and shade balance each other quite well. Those sunning themselves on the lawn are usually mere feet away from a patch of cool and humid temperate broadleaf and mixed forest. The meeting of excellent transit access and the social centrality of the area make it an ideal location for protests to orient. It is large enough to hold an impressive mass of people; the area plays host to nearly all visitors; and it has become the protected courtyard of the city's collection of showcase architecture and prestige addresses. It is the most visible section of the urban environment and is encouraged to be used for this purpose by the municipal government's permit department. As far as protest marching or political rallies are concerned, Montreal has seen a wide variety since the beginning of the Quiet Revolution, and many of the better known have had an interaction with the square and plaza. Dorchester Square is a preferred site, since the area's prominence provides a degree of placation for the crowd‚Äîit quickly becomes obvious that you are highly visible and the message is loud and clear, as office-workers gather by the many windows looking down into it. Moreover, police can observe from a fair distance and generally remain unobtrusive. Generally protests, rallies and demonstrations in Montreal are non-violent, small and calm. In the last few years a weekly protest of little more than a dozen people has convened at the southwest corner of Dorchester Square every Friday during the summer months. The noontime demonstration is against a variety of offences committed by the Government of Israel, whose Consulate General is located across the street in the Tour CIBC. Unity Rally Perhaps the most famous demonstration to take place in this area was the Unity Rally of October 27, 1995. Three days before the 1995 Quebec referendum, Canadians from outside Montreal descended into Dorchester Square and Place du Canada and joined a massive demonstration in support of the federalist campaign against Quebec sovereignty. Crowd estimates varied widely, from 35,000 to 150,000. The event was a massive project which involved Prime Minister Jean Chr√©tien, Progressive Conservative leader (and future Quebec premier) Jean Charest, Quebec Premier Daniel Johnson Jr. and a host of provincial premiers and federal cabinet ministers. Quebec sovereigntist elements were present in comparatively microscopic numbers and had managed to post a few signs, including a banner pulled by a small airplane reading \\"Welcome to Our New Economic Partners!\\" Despite this, the event passed without major incident, as Montreal Police were quick to enforce the rules and parameters of the protest and remove agitators from both sides quickly and quietly. As such, clashes of ideas remained at the level of passionate debate. Current renovation plan Montreal landscape architect Claude Cormier has been chosen to lead a renovation of $3.5 million over four years (2009‚Äì2012) to breathe some new life into the square and plaza. The area will not see any dramatic alterations to its character or composition, but rather will receive a landscaping \\"facelift\\" and a $750,000 lighting system to illuminate the many statues and monuments present.Hustak, Alan. \\"City will revamp Place d'Armes, downtown squares\\", Montreal Gazette, Saturday March 1, 2009 Image gallery Image:Spring Thaw Interior Square.JPGInterior of the square, with two monuments visible, Tribute to Laurier in foreground and Boer War Memorial behind with Dominion Square Building in background Image:Burns and Boer Horse.JPGView from western side of the Square.

The Gregorian mission was a group of Italian monks and priests sent by Pope Gregory the Great to Britain in the late 6th and early 7th centuries to convert and Christianize the Anglo-Saxons from their native Anglo-Saxon paganism.Brooks \\"Gregorian mission (act. 596‚Äì601)\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography The first group consisted of about 40 monks and priests, some of whom had been monks in Gregory's own monastery in Rome. After a long trip, during which they almost gave up and returned to Rome, they arrived in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Kent in 597.Yorke Conversion of Britain pp. 122‚Äì123 Gregory sent a second group of missionaries in 601 as reinforcements, along with books and relics for the newly founded churches.Mayr-Harting Coming of Christianity p. 62 From Kent, the missionaries spread to the East Anglian kingdom and to the north of Britain,Mayr-Harting Coming of Christianity pp. 65‚Äì66 but after King √Üthelberht of Kent's death, the mission was mostly confined to Kent. Another mission was sent to the kingdom of Northumbria when √Üthelberht's daughter married King Edwin of Northumbria around 625. After Edwin's death in 633, a pagan backlash against Christianization occurred, and the mission was again confined to Kent; most of the missionaries fled Northumbria because they feared the pagans who returned to power after Edwin's death.Mayr-Harting Coming of Christianity p. 68 The main source for information on the missionaries is the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum of the medieval writer Bede, written around 731. Bede details several of the members of the mission. Another important source of information is the papal registers which list copies of Gregory's letters sent to the missionaries. Neither source gives a complete listing of the missionaries in either group, so a listing of members must be gathered from scattered references in Bede and Gregory's letters. Although it is known that about 40 people were included in the first group, how many arrived in the second group is unknown. The vagaries of the evidence allow only some of the missionaries to be named. Many of the known members became bishops or archbishops, while most of the remainder became abbots. The lone exception is James the Deacon, who never held a higher office than deacon in the church. Among the archbishops were the first five Archbishops of Canterbury: Augustine, Laurence, Mellitus, Justus, and Honorius; all of them were later canonized as saints.Walsh Dictionary of Saints pp. 73, 268, 348, 357, and 420 Two other missionaries, Paulinus and Romanus, also became bishops. The last group of missionaries became the abbots of the monastery founded by Augustine at Canterbury, later known as St Augustine's Abbey after Augustine. The abbots included Gratiosus, John, Peter, Petronius, and Rufinianus. As well as the five archbishops, three other members of the mission are regarded as saints: Peter, James the Deacon, and Paulinus.

His grandfather, Don Cenobio, was the founder of the Sauza Tequila distillery.  Marriage and Children  In 1927 Francisco Javier married Do√±a Maria Elena ‚ÄúNina‚Äù Gutierrez Salcedo, a cousin of the Cuervo family; they met while attending college in Chicago, Illinois.Nancy Cleeland (1987). A Bottle Full of Fire, San Diego Reader. They had two children: * Sylvia Sauza (born 1932) * Eladio Sauza (born 1937)  Growing Sauza Tequila  When Javier Sauza took over Tequila Sauza, shortly before his father‚Äôs death in 1946, he began plans at once to change the image of tequila from a drink of the campesinos to a refined spirit of the upper classes. His competitors scoffed when he redesigned the bottles and labels for a more tasteful look and began to age some of the tequila in wooden barrels for a smoother taste and color. He took his product to fairs and expositions throughout Mexico, the United States, and Europe and promoted it as ‚Äúthe drink of romance.‚Äù He modernized production and transportation systems and built a bottling plant in Guadalajara. In 1950, Francisco Javier added the Sauza Hornitos brand to the Sauza family of tequila. In 1963, he created Sauza Conmemorativo, a tequila that commemorated the 90th anniversary of the La Perseverancia distillery. In 1973, to celebrate 100 years since the founding of the La Perseverancia distillery, Sauza created a specially aged tequila that he presented in a limited edition, green ceramic bottle. He called his creation Tres Generaciones in honor of the three generations that had produced Sauza Tequila: Don Cenobio, Don Eladio and Don Francisco Javier.Al Lucero, John Harrisson (2004). \\"The Great Margarita Book\\". Ten Speed Press. Traveling throughout Europe and Asia, Sauza became concerned about the number of ‚Äúpseudo-tequilas‚Äù being produced. Working with other tequila producers from Jalisco Francisco lobbied President Jose Lopez Portillo saying, ‚ÄúTequila is only the one made in the State of Jalisco, Mexico.‚Äù On December 9, 1974 the Label of Integrity decree stated that true tequila only came from the State of Jalisco.  Other Enterprises  Francisco Javier extended the entertaining work his father had done by founding a series of shows called ‚ÄúNoches Tapatias‚Äù which frequently featured folk singer Pedro Vargas.  The Final Years  Francisco Javier had continued his father and grandfather‚Äôs legacy, but in 1988, for personal reasons, he decided to sell the Sauza Tequila business to Mexican brandy producer Pedro Domecq. The tequilas Sauza innovated ‚Äì Sauza, Hornitos, Tres Generaciones ‚Äì are still in production. Today Sauza owns about 300 agave plantations and is the second largest tequila manufacturer in the world.Anthony Dias Blue (2004). \\"The Complete Book of Spirits\\". HarperCollins.

In 1945, it had a population of 550. It was occupied by Israeli forces in the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War and became depopulated. History Nearby Khirbet Bayt Jiz has been claimed as the site of the Biblical Gizo and has been linked to the Crusader settlement of Gith, although the latter association was dubbed as doubtful by some historians. Since 1136, the village belonged to the canons of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 41, No 165; cited in Pringle, 1993, p. 101 By 1171, Gith was one of five villages within the Lydda diocese, in which the canons were permitted by the village bishop to have or build a church and control half the village's tithes.R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 129, No 490; cited in Pringle, 1993, p. 101 Bayt Jiz is not recorded in early Arabic sources.Sharon, 1999, p. 145. According to local legend, the maqam (\\"sacred Muslim tomb\\") was built in 1334 to house the sarcophagus of Shaykh Zayd, a local sage. A stone with Arabic inscriptions was found near the maqam, attributing the building of the structure to a Mamluk commander named Sayf ad- Din Aqul. It is the only evidence of early Islamic activity in the village thus far.Sharon, 1999, p. 146 =Ottoman era= In 1838, it was noted as a place \\"in ruins or deserted.\\"Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, Appendix 2, p. 120 In 1883, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described the place, called Khurbet Beit Jiz, as having \\"traces of ruins and a sacred Mukam. To the south are caves. There are foundations and cisterns among the ruins. On the south- west, in Wady el Kharjeh, are a number of pits containing a perennial supply of good water.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 108 The modern village of Bayt Jiz was founded in the early 20th century. =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the British Mandate authorities, Bait Jiz had a population of 203 inhabitants, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub-district of Ramleh, p. 21 increasing in the 1931 census to 371, still all Muslims, in a total of 67 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 18. It had a rectangular plan, narrow streets, and houses constructed of adobe and stone. The village center included a mosque, some shops, and a school built in 1947, shared with nearby Bayt Susin. Bayt Jiz's economy was based on agriculture, with the main crops being grains, figs, vegetables, almonds, and olives. A part of the surrounding land was grassland, enabling the villagers to raise sheep and goats.Khalidi, 1992, p. 364 In the 1945 statistics the population was 550, all Muslims, while the total land area was 8,357 dunams, according to an official land and population survey. Of this, a total of 6,529 dunums of village land was used for cereals, 36 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards,Village Statistics, Government of Palestine. 1945.

Nevertheless, Palestinian historian Aref al-Aref points out that the village had not been evacuated for the first assault of the Battle of Latrun that took place on May 22. He points out that the Israeli attack partly failed because the Israeli forces had received mistaken reports that the village had been evacuated. Consequently, they were surprised to encounter fierce resistance from the local militia as well as from Jordanian regulars in the Latrun sector who sent troops to the village.Abu Nawar, 2002, p.138. Bayt Jiz was occupied by the 7th Armored Brigade of the Haganah in the interval between the first and second assaults on Latrun in late May 1948.Benny Morris, 1948: A History of the First Arab-Israeli War, Yale University Press, 2008. A correspondent for The New York Times reported that the unsuccessful Israeli assault on Latrun spread to Bayt Jiz on May 25.

The reason for studying these kinds of domains is that logarithmically convex Reinhardt domains are the domains of convergence of power series in several complex variables. In one complex variable, a logarithmically convex Reinhardt domain is simply a disc. The intersection of logarithmically convex Reinhardt domains is still a logarithmically convex Reinhardt domain, so for every Reinhardt domain, there is a smallest logarithmically convex Reinhardt domain which contains it. A simple example of logarithmically convex Reinhardt domains is a polydisc, that is, a product of disks. Thullen's classical result says that a 2-dimensional bounded Reinhard domain containing the origin is biholomorphic to one of the following domains provided that the orbit of the origin by the automorphism group has positive dimension: (1) \\\\\\\\{(z,w)\\\\in \\\\mathbf{C}^2;~z<1,~w<1\\\\\\\\} (polydisc); (2) \\\\\\\\{(z,w)\\\\in \\\\mathbf{C}^2;~z^2+w^2<1\\\\\\\\} (unit ball); (3) \\\\\\\\{(z,w)\\\\in \\\\mathbf{C}^2;~z^2+w^{2/p}<1\\\\\\\\} (p>0, eq 1) (Thullen domain).

Specimens growing in the wild, however, are generally larger, averaging five meters in height. Although native to the mountains, mixed forests, and open places in western China, it is commonly cultivated in temperate climates worldwide. Cultivars have been bred in a variety of forms, as ornamental groundcovers or shrubs.  Description  The bark of the willow-leaved cotoneaster is gray-brown, its stems are thin, and its root system is sparse. The leaves are alternate, simple, long, lanceolate, dark green and resemble those of willow trees (thus the common name), and have fine gray hairs on their undersides. The scientific name 'salicifolius', described by the botanist Franchet, means 'with leaves like willows' (see: Genus Salix). During the colder months, they turn maroonish in color. In June it bears many flowered, compound corymbs of white, 5‚Äì6 mm flowers. The fruit grow as small, showy, apple-like, red pomes, ripening in September to October, and enduring into the winter.

The seemingly historical details in the New Testament were built by the early Christian community around narratives of the pre-Christian Jesus.Schweitzer (2000) 378. Smith also argued against the historical value of non-Christian writers regarding Jesus, particularly Josephus and Tacitus.Van Voorst (2000) 12. Infamously, Smith was also a white supremacy advocate whose book The Color Line: A Brief on Behalf of the Unborn (1905) argued for the racial inferiority of Negroes. He unsuccessfully challenged the studies of races by American anthropologist Franz Boas.Baker (2004). Translator Upon his death in 1934, Smith left a partial translation of Homer's Iliad. This work was completed by his old Tulane colleague Walter Miller and when published in 1944 was the first English translation in the original dactylic hexameter.

Role as Chicago Outfit leader  In 1997, the Chicago Sun-Times identified Centracchio as heading up the Chicago Outfit's operations in DuPage County, Illinois. And in July 1997, the Sun-Times identified Centracchio as heading up the Outfit's operations in Chicago's western suburbs and on Chicago's West Side. In 1999, the Chicago Tribune identified Centracchio as being one of only three area bosses reporting to Chicago's two top mob bosses.  Chicago Outfit career  In 1962, Centracchio was convicted of stealing two trucks containing $75,000 worth of TVs and radios. Centracchio wound up serving about 18 months in federal prison. Centracchio also was once described as a lieutenant of longtime Chicago Outfit boss Joseph Lombardo. For much of his career, Centracchio operated legitimate businesses, including an abortion clinic on Chicago's West Side that had been incorporated in 1990. Centracchio also owned part of a carpet company and a jewelry shop. In January 1996, Chicago newspapers reported that Centracchio was the subject of a federal probe that involved him allegedly paying the former chief of police of Northlake, Illinois and the former chief of detectives of Stone Park, Illinois to protect illegal poker machines, entertainment and vice in the two suburbs. Investigators were alleged to have installed a hidden camera in Centracchio's office, as well as bugging the phones of the two officers. The former Northlake police chief, Seymour Sapoznik, pleaded guilty in February 1997, admitting he accepted payoffs from the mob from 1990 until 1994. Sapoznik later was sentenced to seven years and four months in federal prison. On May 3, 1999, Centracchio was charged by federal officials with bribing the mayor of Stone Park, Illinois and a former Franklin Park, Illinois police officer with monthly payments dating back to 1978 to protect illegal video gambling operations in the two suburbs. Centracchio also was charged with extortion in connection with collecting \\"street taxes\\" from several adult bookstores and theaters in Illinois and Wisconsin. In addition, Centracchio was charged with possessing a firearm as a felon. The indictment also alleged that Centracchio had been involved in illegal gambling operations since 1978 and had been the boss since mob boss Louis Eboli died in 1987. Finally, Centracchio was charged with paying protection money to police and village officials in Northlake, Illinois, and Melrose Park, Illinois. Centracchio was released on bond awaiting trial. Centracchio pleaded not guilty to the charges, with a trial scheduled for 2001. In February 2001, federal prosecutors released transcripts of conversations between Centracchio and a strip club owner explaining the monthly protection payoffs that he paid to police officials in various suburbs. Centracchio died in August 2001  Death  Centracchio died of cancer at his home in Oak Brook, Illinois, which is an upscale Chicago suburb.

Informally, it states that the support of the singularities of such functions cannot be compact, therefore the singular set of a function of several complex variables must (loosely speaking) 'go off to infinity' in some direction. More precisely, it shows that an isolated singularity is always a removable singularity for any analytic function of complex variables. A first version of this theorem was proved by Friedrich Hartogs,See the original paper of and its description in various historical surveys by , and . In particular, in this last reference on p. 132, the Author explicitly writes :-\\"As it is pointed out in the title of , and as the reader shall soon see, the key tool in the proof is the Cauchy integral formula\\". and as such it is known also as Hartogs's lemma and Hartogs's principle: in earlier Soviet literature,See for example , which refers the reader to the book of for a proof (however, in the former reference it is incorrectly stated that the proof is on page 324). it is also called Osgood‚ÄìBrown theorem, acknowledging later work by Arthur Barton Brown and William Fogg Osgood.See and . This property of holomorphic functions of several variables is also called Hartogs's phenomenon: however, the locution \\"Hartogs's phenomenon\\" is also used to identify the property of solutions of systems of partial differential or convolution equations satisfying Hartogs type theorems.See and . Historical note The original proof was given by Friedrich Hartogs in 1906, using Cauchy's integral formula for functions of several complex variables. Today, usual proofs rely on either the Bochner‚ÄìMartinelli‚ÄìKoppelman formula or the solution of the inhomogeneous Cauchy‚ÄìRiemann equations with compact support. The latter approach is due to Leon Ehrenpreis who initiated it in the paper . Yet another very simple proof of this result was given by Gaetano Fichera in the paper , by using his solution of the Dirichlet problem for holomorphic functions of several variables and the related concept of CR-function:Fichera's prof as well as his epoch making paper seem to have been overlooked by many specialists of the theory of functions of several complex variables: see for the correct attribution of many important theorems in this field. later he extended the theorem to a certain class of partial differential operators in the paper , and his ideas were later further explored by Giuliano Bratti.See . Also the Japanese school of the theory of partial differential operators worked much on this topic, with notable contributions by Akira Kaneko.See his paper and the references therein. Their approach is to use Ehrenpreis's fundamental principle. Hartogs's phenomenon A phenomenon that holds in several variables but does not hold in one variable is called Hartogs's phenomenon, which lead to the notion of this Hartogs's extension theorem and the domain of holomorphy, hence the theory of several complex variables. For example, in two variables, consider the interior domain :H_\\\\varepsilon = \\\\\\\\{z=(z_1,z_2)\\\\in\\\\Delta^2:z_1<\\\\varepsilon\\\\ \\\\ \\\\text{or}\\\\ \\\\ 1-\\\\varepsilon< z_2\\\\\\\\} in the two-dimensional polydisk \\\\Delta^2=\\\\\\\\{z\\\\in\\\\mathbb{C}^2;z_1<1,z_2<1\\\\\\\\} where 0 <\\\\varepsilon < 1 . Theorem : any holomorphic functions f on H_\\\\varepsilon are analytically continued to \\\\Delta^2 . Namely, there is a holomorphic function F on \\\\Delta^2 such that F=f on H_\\\\varepsilon . In fact, using the Cauchy integral formula we obtain the extended function F . All holomorphic functions are analytically continued to the polydisk, which is strictly larger than the domain on which the original holomorphic function is defined. Such phenomena never happen in the case of one variable. Formal statement :Let be a holomorphic function on a set , where is an open subset of () and is a compact subset of . If the complement is connected, then can be extended to a unique holomorphic function on . Counterexamples in dimension one The theorem does not hold when . To see this, it suffices to consider the function , which is clearly holomorphic in but cannot be continued as a holomorphic function on the whole . Therefore, the Hartogs's phenomenon is an elementary phenomenon that highlights the difference between the theory of functions of one and several complex variables.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. The complex was the first large court building designed for a rural town in Queensland. It was the forerunner for several other buildings in regional areas. The building is rectangular in form with corner towers and connecting verandahs, and was constructed in rendered brick, with timber work forming the verandahs. The building stands as part of the historic Wharf Street precinct in central Maryborough. The courthouse has been in continuous use by the supreme, district and magistrates courts of Queensland since it was completed in 1878, making it the longest serving and oldest courthouse in use in Queensland.  History  The Maryborough Courthouse was constructed in 1877 to the design of the then Queensland Colonial Architect, FDG Stanley for use as both a courthouse and as offices for Queensland Government departments. The building is the second Maryborough Courthouse replacing an earlier 1860s building constructed on another site. The original township of Maryborough was situated, not in its current place, but on the north of the Mary River, after wharves were established in 1847-1848, to provide transport for wool from sheep stations on the Burnett River. In 1852 the growing town was gradually transferred further south where ships were better able to navigate the river. Development followed and by March 1861, Maryborough was declared a municipality (the Borough of Maryborough) and Henry Palmer was appointed as the first Mayor. During the late 1860s and 1870s Maryborough developed rapidly as the port of the nearby Gympie goldfields. The first circuit court hearings were held in local hotels from the late 1850s. In about 1856 a permanent courthouse and lockup for Maryborough were designed by Alexander Dawson, Colonial Architect of New South Wales. By 1857 the New South Wales Government voted that the sum of be spent on the erection of a courthouse and lockup, but it seems this was not completed until after the Separation of Queensland in the early 1860s and seems to be unattributable to Alexander Dawson. These brick buildings, supposedly the first brick structures in Maryborough, were built on the corner of Kent and Adelaide Streets, on the site of the present City Hall, which had been reserved for courthouse use in early Maryborough surveys. Repairs and additions were made to these buildings in 1871 but, soon after, plans were being prepared for a new courthouse. This was to be constructed on another site several blocks to the east of the first site, which had become available in 1874 following the relocation of the emigration barracks and the consequent extension of the adjacent Queen's Park. FDG Stanley, the Colonial Architect of Queensland was responsible for the design of the new building. Stanley arrived in Queensland in 1861 from Scotland where he trained. He was appointed to the Office of the Colonial Architect in 1863 as a clerk of works and in 1872 succeeded Charles Tiffin as the Colonial Architect. Prior to being asked to design the Maryborough Courthouse, Stanley was already experienced in the design of large public buildings, although this was early in his prolific career in Queensland. Stanley conceived the Maryborough Courthouse as a double-storeyed arcaded pavilion with towers at each corner, sited between Queens Park and the adjacent street. The footprint of the building was set well back from Wharf Street providing space for a garden forecourt with Jacaranda trees enhancing the principal entrance. Stanley write a memo about his proposal for the Courthouse in September 1875: > the design has been arranged so as to place offices of the Department of > Roads, Public Lands and Survey on the ground floor as being more readily > accessible from the street, and the courts and offices associated therewith > on the upper floor as being removed from noise and as being in a better > position as regards ventilation. The material to be employed is brick on > stone foundations faced in cement when not covered by verandahs; the roof to > be slated and the internal finishings of a plain substantial character. The necessity of segregating the top and bottom floors caused Stanley to provide two separate stair halls at each end of the pavilion within the two corner towers nearest the park, at the rear of the building, to which access was provided from the north eastern verandah. The northern stair gave access for judges and barristers and the eastern stair was provided for prisoners escorted by police and the public. Courthouse, circa 1890 The Maryborough Courthouse was constructed for about after Stanley's initial estimation of about . Tenders were called on 20 October 1875 and on 19 November 1876 the lowest tender of local contractor, John Thomas Annear was accepted who undertook to complete the building within twelve months. The building was occupied, at least partially, by August 1877. Stanley remained in the position of Colonial Architect for effectively ten years, from 1871 until 1881, during which time and with the help of his staff he produced many fine public buildings throughout Queensland, including several Maryborough buildings. The former courthouse was retained at its original site and became used as a quarters for police and was demolished to make way for the construction of the new Town Hall in 1908. Many alterations have occurred since construction within the Courthouse precinct affecting both the setting and the building fabric. Firstly, stables were added by 1878. Very soon after construction another stair was built in the part of the south-east verandah and for dedicated public use, where previously they were sharing the prisoner's stair. During the late nineteenth century and early twentieth century window shades were added, repair and repainting work was done and additional closets were built. The ground floor of the courthouse provided offices for Queensland Government departments. However, more floor space was needed for the government departments and therefore a decision was made to erect a new building. This was in line with government policy for encouraging capital works in the 1930s to overcome the effect of the Great Depression. The Government Offices Building was designed by the Department of Public Works and two staff members seem to have been involved on the project. Two drawings of the proposed building were prepared. The first set was drawn by Gilbert Robert Beveridge and included elevations, ceiling and roof plans and general layouts of the site and the other, by Raymond Clare Nowland is a detailed floor plan. The addition of the Government Offices Building in 1939 between Wharf Street and the courthouse replaced the established garden and dramatically altered the context of the courthouse. The Government Offices Building is separately heritage-listed. Because the construction of the new offices solved problems of space in the courthouse, the courthouse was remodelled internally at the same time. This remodelling occurred in 1942 at a cost of and involved limiting access to Richmond Street, removing internal partitions on the ground floor level and removing six fireplaces. Also new stairs were constructed in three of the four corners of the building and a stables was demolished to make way for an air raid shelter.  Description  Architectural plans, circa 1888 The Maryborough Courthouse is a two storeyed rendered brick building, situated on the edge of Queen's Park, facing Richmond Street and the principal facade of Customs House across Richmond Street. The building has a rectangular-shaped floor plan and a corrugated iron gabled roof. Lining the facades of the building are double-storeyed verandahs, or loggias, which are recessed between rusticated corner pavilion towers. The verandahs are semi-enclosed on the ground floor by a light timber framed arcade supported on timber columns. Circular timber motifs appear in the open spandrels of the arches. The upper level of the verandah comprises a number of regularly spaced timber posts with cross-braced timber balustrading. The timber posts support a skillion awning which has a wide facia board where decorative timber brackets are aligned with the posts below. Above the verandah on the two short sides of the building are three semi-circular openings above which is the gabled end of the roof. Centrally located on the edge of the verandah of the ground floor of the long elevations of the building, facing the park and the Government Offices, are masonry pavilion entrances with round arched entrances. The square planned corner pavilion towers between which the verandahs are placed, are rusticated at ground floor level with a round arched opening on each face, and smooth rendered on the first floor with a group of three round arched openings. Above these openings is a substantial cornice supported on closely spaced timber brackets. Above this moulding is a simple corniced parapet concealing the roofs of the pavilions. The parapet has a central moulded panel of interlocking circles. The building was designed to accommodate offices on the ground floor and a courtroom and associated office space on the upper floor. The ground floor is presently essentially open plan with offices at the rear of the floor. The ground floor has a plaster ceiling with darkly stained timber grid framing. Regularly throughout the open section of the floor are substantial square planed stop-chamfered rendered masonry columns. The rear offices are formed with plaster rendered walls and feature similar coffered ceiling framing. The upper floor is accessed via a concrete stair in the southern tower, dating from the early 1940s. An open balcony on the first floor acts as an entrance vestibule to the courtroom which is entered via a double timber door. The courtroom is a large open plan room fitted with nineteenth century furniture. The original ceiling has been concealed with a suspended grid ceiling, housing lighting and other services. The room is naturally lit with a number of large windows and french lights opening onto the adjacent verandahs. Above these openings are high level semi-circular windows which sit on a string course lining the room. The walls are painted and bagged brickwork with a plaster skirting board.  Heritage listing  Maryborough Courthouse was listed in the Register of the National Estate on 21 March 1978. It was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Maryborough Courthouse, constructed in 1877, demonstrates the growth of Maryborough in the 1860s and 1870s as a result of the discovery of gold in Gympie, for which Maryborough became the principal port. The building demonstrates the early civic history of Maryborough and has special social value for the community for its long and continued use as a public building. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Courthouse is a good example of a Queensland courthouse of the nineteenth century, with classical architectural influences, adapted to the sub-tropical Maryborough climate. The layout and form of the building are characteristic of a late nineteenth century courthouse. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The building has aesthetic significance as a well composed Maryborough landmark with inherent formal qualities, symmetrical massing and repetitive rhythmic detailing which combine to produce a strong composition in its Queens Park setting which contributes to its aesthetic value. The building forms an integral component of a civic precinct with the adjacent State Government Offices, which although later are clearly designed to harmonise with the Courthouse. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The Courthouse has special associations with its designer, FDG Stanley who was Queensland's most prolific Colonial Architect.

They were a far more successful team than the Tars had been, winning the league championship in 1956 and making four other playoff appearances under manager Ben Geraghty. One of the first integrated professional baseball teams in the league and in Florida, the Braves fielded standout players such as Hank Aaron and F√©lix Mantilla. In 1961 an ownership deal changed the team's major league affiliation, and the Braves were replaced by the Jacksonville Jets for the 1961 season. History Two teams named the Jacksonville Tars had played in Jacksonville since 1926, with the last incarnation playing in the Sally League from 1936. The Class A affiliate of the New York Giants, the Tars were described as an unprofessional outfit, and played mostly losing baseball during their run.Foley, Bill (October 22, 1997). \\"Braves ousted again: It's the Jacksonville jinx\\". The Florida Times-Union. Retrieved June 29, 2011. In 1953 Jacksonville businessman Samuel W. Wolfson bought the Tars franchise, and signed an affiliation agreement with the Boston Braves (who became the Milwaukee Braves very shortly after). The team was reorganized and renamed the Jacksonville Braves. Wolfson retained manager Ben Geraghty, but little else of the Tars survived the transition. Among the major changes included integration. Wolfson brought in black players from the Braves' farm system, including Hank Aaron, F√©lix Mantilla, and Horace Garner, making Jacksonville one of the first two integrated teams to play in the South Atlantic League. As such, they were also one of the first teams in Florida to field black players.McCarthy, Kevin (1996). Baseball in Florida, pp. 97‚Äì100. Pineapple Press. Retrieved June 29, 2011.

The Braves drew strong crowds and performed well on the field, proving more successful than the Tars had ever been. They went to the South Atlantic League playoffs five times in eight years, advancing to the finals in 1953, 1954, and 1958, and winning the championship in 1956. They were the impetus for the construction of a new stadium, which opened in 1955 and replaced the aging Durkee Field. The new park was later named Wolfson Park after Samuel W. Wolfson.Frenrette, Gene (August 25, 2002). \\"Wolfson Park nears its final innings\\". The Florida Times- Union. Retrieved June 29, 2011. In 1957 Wolfson, suffering from ill health, sold the team to a group of businessmen including Bill Terry, who in turn sold it to Texas millionaire Craig F. Cullinan, Jr. When Cullinan won a Major League Baseball expansion franchise in 1960, league rules required the Milwaukee Braves to pull their affiliation with Jacksonville. The Jacksonville Braves came to an end, and were replaced with the short-lived Jacksonville Jets, affiliates of Cullinan's new team, the Houston Colt .45s (now the Houston Astros). The Jets were not nearly as successful as the Braves had been.

History The project was active from 1962 to 1972, and produced the Project Physics series of texts, which were used in physics classrooms in the 1970s and 1980s. The project was centered at Harvard University, but drew from schools and educators from across the country. The directors of this project were: F. James Rutherford, project coordinator (and after completion of the project, professor of science education at New York University); Gerald Holton, professor of physics and of the history of science at Harvard University; and Fletcher G. Watson, professor of science education at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. Course materials Project Physics course work was broken into six main subject areas, organized into separate books each called a \\"Project Physics Text and Handbook\\" or \\"Student Guide\\":Project Physics Collection at Archive.org #Concepts of Motion #Motion in the Heavens #The Triumph of Mechanics #Light and Electromagnetism #Models of the Atom #The Nucleus The books presented the material from a historical perspective, with aspects of human interest wrapped into the text. The intent was to build a sophisticated conceptual understanding of physics, while not over-simplifying the curriculum. Frequent references to historical works where concepts were first discovered and debated highlighted the drive to make physics a fundamental search for understanding of the universe. The course materials also included readers, tests, and other teaching aids. The course readers allowed students to further explore a topic, and lab exercises enabled students to verify that their understanding was confirmed by experimental outcomes. Special lab equipment, brief film loops, films, and a teacher's guide were also developed. The texts and all other aids are now available for free on the Project Physics Collection web site.

The algorithms are openly documented and may be used free of software patent restrictions. Development of the format was maintained by the Xiph.Org Foundation (as part of the Ogg codec family) and later coordinated by the Opus working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). CELT was meant to bridge the gap between Vorbis and Speex for applications where both high quality audio and low delay are desired. It is suitable for both speech and music. It borrows ideas from the CELP algorithm, but avoids some of its limitations by operating in the frequency domain exclusively. The original stand-alone CELT has been merged into Opus. Therefore, CELT as stand-alone format is now abandoned and obsolete. Development is going on only for its hybridised form as a layer of Opus, integrated with SILK. This article covers the historic, stand-alone format; for the integrated form and its evolution since the integration into Opus see the article on Opus.  Properties  CELT's central feature is low algorithmic delay. It allows for latencies of typically 3 to 9 ms but is configurable to below 2 ms at the price of more bitrate to reach a similar audio quality. CELT supports mono and stereo audio and is applicable to both speech and music. It can use a sampling rate from 32 kHz to 48 kHz and above and an adaptive bitrate from 24 kbit/s to 128 kbit/s per channel and above. There are no known intellectual property issues pertaining to the CELT algorithm, and its reference implementation is published under a permissive open-source license (the 2-clause BSD). Like Vorbis, CELT is a fullband (entire human hearing range) general-purpose codec, i.e. not specialized for special types of audio signals and therefore different from its sibling project Speex. The format enables for transparent results at high bitrates, as well as very decent quality at lower bitrates. All in all, the compression capabilities are said to be significantly superior to those of MP3, and as another useful feature for realtime applications like telephony, CELT's audio quality at lower bitrates are even on par with HE-AACv1, thanks to the band folding. In comparative double-blind listening tests it proved to be noticeably superior to HE-AACv1 at ~64 kBit/s. It has a comparably low computational complexity that resembles that of the low-delay variant of AAC (AAC-LD) and stays significantly below the complexity of Vorbis. It enables for constant and variable bitrate. If the signal disappears into the noise floor in speech pauses and similar cases, the transmission can be limited to signal the output of comfort noise to the decoder. Most settings of the naturally streaming-enabled format can be changed on the fly without interrupting transmission. The format is robust to transmission errors. Loss of whole packets as well as bit errors can be masked with a steady degradation of audio quality (packet loss concealment, PLC).  Technology  block diagram of the codec CELT is a transform codec based on the modified discrete cosine transform (MDCT) and concepts from CELP (with a code book for excitation, but in the frequency domain). The initial PCM-coded signal is handled in relatively small, overlapping blocks for the MDCT (window function) and transformed to frequency coefficients. Choosing an especially short block size on the one hand enables for a low latency, but also leads to poor frequency resolution that has to be compensated. For a further reduction of the algorithmic delay to the expense of a minor sacrifice in audio quality, the by nature 50% of overlap between the blocks is practically cut down to half by silencing the signal during one eight at both ends of a block, respectively. The coefficients are grouped to resemble the critical bands of the human auditory system. The entire amount of energy of each group is analysed and the values quantised for data reduction and compressed through prediction by only transmitting the difference to the predicted values (delta encoding). The (unquantised) band energy values are removed from the raw DCT coefficients (normalisation). The coefficients of the resulting residual signal (so-called ‚Äúband shape‚Äù) are coded by Pyramid Vector Quantisation (PVQ, a spherical vector quantisation). This encoding leads to code words of fixed (predictable) length, which in turn enables for robustness against bit errors and leaves no need for entropy encoding. Finally, all output of the encoder are coded to one bitstream by a range encoder. In connection with the PVQ, CELT uses a technique known as band folding, which delivers a similar effect to spectral band replication (SBR) by reusing coefficients of lower bands for higher ones, but has much less impact on the algorithmic delay and computational complexity than the SBR. This works against ‚Äúbirdie‚Äù artifacts by preserving more richness in the appropriate frequency bands. The decoder unpacks the individual components from the range coded bitstream, multiplies the band energy to the band shape coefficients and transforms them back (via iMDCT) to PCM data. The individual blocks are rejoined using weighted overlap- add (WOLA). Many parameters are not explicitly coded, but instead reconstructed by using the same functions as the encoder. For the channel coupling CELT may use M/S stereo or intensity stereo. Blocks can be described independent from adjacent frames (Intra-frame); for example to enable a decoder to jump into a running stream. With transform codecs so-called pre- echo artifacts can get audible, because the quantisation error of sharp, energy-heavy sounds (transients) can spread over the entire DCT block and the transient doesn't mask them backward in time as well as forward. With CELT each block can be further divided to thwart such artifacts.  History  First work on plans and drafts for a Vorbis successor was done in 2005 at Xiph.org as part of the Ghost project (initially talked about as ‚ÄúVorbis II‚Äù). This discussion together with Vorbis creator Christopher Montgomery led to Jean-Marc Valin‚Ä≤s interest in a particularly low-latency codec. Valin has worked on CELT since 2007. In December 2007, the first draft version of libcelt was published as version 0.0.1, initially named ‚ÄúCode-Excited Lapped Transform‚Äù. CELT was established as an IETF technology in July 2009 under the \\"ietfcodec\\" working group. In May 2009, a draft of RTP payload format for the CELT Codec was published. In version 0.9, the pitch prediction operating in the frequency domain used until then was replaced by a less complex solution with a pre- and postfilter pair in time domain, which was contributed by Raymond Chen of Broadcom. With CELT 0.11 from February 4, 2011 the format was tentatively frozen (‚Äúsoft freeze‚Äù) ‚Äì reserving the possibility of unexpectedly necessary last changes. Shortly after the advent of the CELT/SILK hybrid codec Opus (formerly known as Harmony), the development of CELT as a separate project was halted, instead living on the basis of Opus, which aims to treat the lower part of the spectral range in the time domain with linear prediction (SILK) and the higher part in the frequency domain with the MDCT. The draft for Opus has been registered at the IETF since September 2010.  Software  The software library libcelt serves as the reference implementation for CELT, written in C and published as free software under Xiph's own 3-clause BSD-ish license. Despite the format not being finally frozen, it was being used in many VoIP applications such as Ekiga and FreeSWITCH, which switched to CELT upon entering soft-freeze in January 2009, as well as Mumble, TeamSpeak and other software. In April 2011, support for CELT was included in FFmpeg.

Reichenwallner - neighbor * Matthias Paul - Gestapo officer Synopsis The film is set in Nazi Germany in 1942. An Aryan family, the Mei√üners, and a Jewish family, the Silbersteins, are neighbors and friends. The respective sons in each family, Heinrich Mei√üner and David Silberstein, discreetly take piano lessons together. The deportation of the Silbersteins to a concentration camp is imminent, and when Heinrich asks why they may have to go soon, Frau Mei√üner does not tell Heinrich the truth. She instead invents a story that the Silbersteins will go to a new place called \\"Toyland\\". Heinrich says that when the Silbersteins go, he wants to go with them, so that he can still be with his friend David, which terrifies Frau Mei√üner. The morning the Silbersteins are taken away for deportation, Heinrich is found missing from his room. His mother, Marianne Mei√üner begins to search for Heinrich. She encounters ridicule from Gestapo officers after she explains her situation, because they think that she is Jewish. However, after she shows her papers that prove that she is Aryan, they accept her story about Heinrich and assist in searching for him. The search continues until the last moment before the train with the Silbersteins on it must leave. When the train doors are opened, Marianne calls out to Heinrich. The crowd moves aside and Marianne sees a boy she thinks is Heinrich hugging the Silbersteins, but instead it is David. A flashback shows that when the Silbersteins were taken away, Heinrich was not allowed to join them. Marianne realizes that Heinrich is not with them, but - to save his life - calls out to David as though he is Heinrich. The Silbersteins let go of him and all continue the ruse that David is Heinrich. David returns to the Mei√üners home where he is raised with Heinrich as their own son. Production According to Freydank, it took two years to secure financing for the production, whose costs totaled ‚Ç¨30,000. The actors and production crew initially received no salary. Starting on 22 January 2007, the film was shot in 5 days in and around the Berlin area. Exactly one year later, on 22 January 2008, the film received its German premiere at the Saarbr√ºcken \\"Film Festival Max Oph√ºls Preis\\".

He specialized in portraying members of Lima's nobility and the political elite of the Viceroyalty of Peru. Aguilar was a criollo born in Lima. He began his artistic career as a portraitist of nuns, monks, and professors. In 1756, for example, he painted the portrait of the nun Mar√≠a del Esp√≠ritu Santo Matoso. He had previously created the popular posthumous image of Barnuevo Pedro de Peralta. Appreciation for his work increased significantly, to the point that he was called before Manuel de Amat y Juniet. Aguilar painted Amat several times; his most famous image, painted in 1771, depicts Amat as the protector of the monastery of the Nazarene.

The only known specimen was found in rocks of the Middle Jurassic Entrada Sandstone of Entrada Ranch, Grand County, Utah. Middle Jurassic terrestrial tetrapods are very rare, and Entradasuchus was the first unequivocal North American Middle Jurassic nonmarine tetrapod known from body fossils when it was described (1995). Description Entradasuchus is based on CU-MWC 183-11, a skeleton including at least the upper surfaces of the skull, articulated armor scutes from the neck to the tail, and some limb bones, all preserved in top (dorsal) view. The exact composition of the specimen was unknown at the time of its description, because it is preserved in sandstone that is harder than the calcite that has replaced the bones, which makes preparation difficult. Additionally, much of the visible part of the skeleton is represented by mold impressions of eroded bones. The block containing the specimen weathered from canyon walls and probably came from the middle Moab Member of the Entrada Sandstone, dated to the very late middle Callovian of the Middle Jurassic. The Moab Member of the Entrada Sandstone represents an inland dune (eolian) setting. The skull of CU-MWC 183-11 is distinguished by the width of the posterior portion. Approximately 42 pairs of scutes ran down the midline of the back. The first pair behind the skull were square, but those on the back and tail were rectangular and had short spiny projections on their posterior outside corners. These spines inspired the name of the type species: E. spinosus. CU-MWC 183-11 was not a large animal, with a skull only a few centimeters or inches long. This small size and the form of the skull could indicate it was a juvenile, but the fusion of the parietals in the skull and the generally small size of animals found in settings like the upper Entrada Sandstone suggest it was an adult. Adrian Hunt and Martin Lockley, who described Entradasuchus in 1995, classified it as Crocodyliformes incertae sedis. The type specimen is curated at the Museum of Western Colorado in Fruita, Colorado.

Pergrin (26 July 1917 ‚Äì 7 April 2012) was commanding officer of the 291st Engineer Combat Battalion of the United States Army during World War II. Before the war he earned an engineering degree at Pennsylvania State University, graduating in 1940. While at Penn State he participated in the ROTC program. In addition, Pergrin played on the university's football team, was elected to the Tau Beta Pi and Chi Epsilon engineering honor societies, and was senior class president. Before graduation he was voted Outstanding Non-Fraternity senior. In his role as senior class president, he presented the university with the Class of 1940 gift ‚Äì the Nittany Lion Shrine, a 14-ton limestone monument symbolizing the Penn State tradition. However, the monument was not officially dedicated until 1942.Pergrin and Hammel. First Across the Rhine. 1989.  Military service  Pergrin was called to active duty in April 1941, with the rank of 2nd Lieutenant. After helping train numerous engineering platoons and companies, he was transferred to the new 291st Engineer Combat Battalion in April, 1943 to assist in its training. In August, he was given command of the battalion when it completed its states-side training. During training in the United States and Britain, then Major, later Lt. Colonel, Pergrin emphasized individual leadership which he credited as the main reason for the unit's success in completing its missions, especially while under enemy fire. = Battle of the Bulge = The battalion served in France, Belgium and Germany. It was particularly effective as the engineer unit that primarily caused the delay of the advance elements of the Sixth Panzer Army, especially the Kampfgruppe under command of Joachim Peiper, during the Battle of the Bulge. Individual squads and platoons blew bridges, planted mines, and defended roadblocks in the face of oncoming tank columns, causing further confusion in German plans. Upon seeing another bridge blown up just as his tanks reached it, Peiper is said to have uttered the words, \\"Diese verdammten Pioniere!, Diese verdammten Pioniere!\\" (\\"Those damned engineers! Those damned engineers!\\"). Kampfgruppe Peiper was eventually contained and the Waffen-SS tankers had to abandon their vehicles. Elements of the 291st were the first American soldiers to contact and rescue wounded survivors of the Malmedy massacre, and it was Pergrin who initially reported the massacre to higher headquarters. Later, toward the end of the Battle of the Bulge, the 291st was assigned responsibility to uncover the bodies of soldiers massacred at Malmedy for Graves Registration Service troops and documenting officers. = Battle of Remagen = Due to its stellar reputation for working under enemy fire, the battalion was selected to build a treadway bridge down the Rhine river from the Ludendorff Bridge captured during the Battle of Remagen. The 291st began constructing the treadway bridge at 8:30 AM on 9 March about down river. The crews and the treadway bridge were struck by artillery and tank rounds and suffered several direct hits, slowing work on the bridge. They completed the first tactical bridge across the river in 32 hours at 5:10 PM on 10 March. At it was the longest tactical bridge ever built under fire. A German forward artillery observer with a radio was captured in Remagen, and artillery fire gradually let up. = Recognition = The 291st was the most decorated combat engineering unit of World War II. The unit built more than 70 bridges‚Äî19 while under enemy fire‚Äî, cleared land mines, and demolished bridges during the Battle of the Bulge. It received the Presidential Unit Citation and other awards for its performance during the Battle of the Bulge. Pergrin was recognized with the Purple Heart, Silver Star, Bronze Star, Presidential Unit Citation, Croix de guerre from France and Belgium, and the silver order of the De Fleurry Medal. In 1998, he was awarded the Freedom Foundation's George Washington Medal of Honor.Esteemed WWII colonel passes away at age 94  Post war  In 1988, Pergin received Penn State University's Outstanding Engineer Award.

The classification system exists independently of other ecoregion systems, one created by the World Wildlife Fund and the other in use by Environment Canada, which is based on one created by the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) and also in use by the American Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The system of biogeoclimatic zones was partly created for the purpose of managing forestry resources, but is also in use by the British Columbia Ministry of Environment and other provincial agencies. A biogeoclimatic zone is defined as \\"a geographic area having similar patterns of energy flow, vegetation and soils as a result of a broadly homogenous macroclimate.\\"Mongabay.com Biogeoclimatic zone page, quoting BC MoFGlossary of Forestry Terms in British Columbia, Ministry of Forests and Range, Government of British Columbia All zones are officially abbreviated in capital letters (AT for Alpine Tundra, BWBS for Boreal White and Black Spruce, and so on). Subzones have their connotative codes in lower case with the first letter denoting relative moistness and the second relative temperature; thus the northeastern BWBS with its warm thundery summers has been mapped as BWBSmw for \\"moist warm\\" while the Alsek Ranges subzone in the northwestern panhandle, stormy in all seasons with winds blowing from glaciers, is BWBSvk for \\"very wet cool.\\" Subzones may be divided into variants, each of which is denoted by a number. For example, the numerous variants of the Interior Cedar-Hemlock moist warm subzone are designated as ICHmw1, ICHmw2, etc. A variant may be divided into phases, such as ICHmc1a, the amabilis fir phase of the Interior Cedar-Hemlock moist cold subzone. The biogeoclimatic zones of British Columbia are: Alpine Tundra (AT) Alpine Tundra in the Coast Range, near Whistler Mountain The Alpine Tundra zone is the harshest and least-populated biozone in the Province. It occupies the high elevations of mountainous areas, and is especially common in the Coast Range. The elevation range of this zone varies by area: in the southwest it starts at , in the southeast, , in the north from , and in the northwest it can start as low as . Most life is found in the lower ranges of the zone. The terrain in this zone is dominated by ice, snow, rock, and glaciers. Glacier-related features like cirques, talus, alpine lakes and moraine are common. Climate is a major barrier to life; the growing season is extremely short. Mean average temperature usually ranges from to , and even in summer the average temperature does not exceed . The zone sees heavy precipitation, usually in the form of snow. Tree species are rarely found in this zone, and when they do grow, they take the low, sprawling Krummholz form. Shrubs are common, especially dwarf evergreen species like partridgefoot, kinnikinnick, crowberry, lingonberry, and alpine-azalea. Grasses, heath, and sedges are also present. Wetter areas see a larger variety of plant species. Higher elevations are exclusively the realm of the lichens. Due to its harsh winters, few animals live in the zone year-round. However, in the spring, summer, and fall, many species are found. Mountain goats, big-horned sheep, stone sheep, Roosevelt elk, blacktailed deer, mule deer, elk, and caribou all take advantage of summer growth in the zone. Grey wolves follow the ungulates. Bears, such as black and grizzly, enjoy the many berries of the alpine meadows in the zone. Smaller mammals like the wolverine, hoary marmot, the endangered Vancouver Island marmot, Arctic ground squirrel, and the Siberian lemming are present. Birds of prey include the golden eagle and gyrfalcon. Ground birds such as the ptarmigan nest in the alpine zone, while other bird species like the snow bunting and rosy finch venture upwards from the treeline. Spruce‚ÄîWillow‚ÄîBirch (SWB) Found only in the north of the province, this zone occurs in the sub-alpine of the Interior Mountains. White spruce is the most abundant conifer in the Spruce-Willow-Birch (SWB) zone, except at the upper (parkland) elevations, where subalpine fir dominates. Engelmann spruce and hybrid white √ó Engelmann spruce is a primary feature distinguishing the SWB from the more southerly ESSF zone. Subalpine fir is the most common associate of white spruce in the SWB zone. Black spruce (Picea mariana), lodgepole pine and trembling aspen (Populus tremuloides) are relatively minor associates. Many spruce stands are quite open, with a well-developed shrub layer dominated by a variety of willows (Salix glauca, S. planifolia, S. scouleriana, S. bebbiana) and scrub birch (Betula glandulosa). Other common shrubs include Potentilla fruticosa, Shepherdia canadensis, Empetrum nigrum, Vaccinium vitis-idaea, V. caespitosum and Ledum groenlandicum. Common herbs are Linnaea borealis, Festuca altaica, Epilobium angustifolium, Lupinus arcticu and Mertensia paniculata. In addition to the feather mosses Pleurozium schreberi and Hylocomium splendens, the forest floor contains a diversity of lichens (Coates et al. 1994).Coates, K.D.; Haeussler, S.; Lindeburgh, S.; Pojar, R.; Stock, A.J. 1994. Ecology and silviculture of interior spruce in British Columbia. Canada/British Columbia Partnership Agreement For. Resour. Devel., Victoria BC, FRDA Rep. 220. 182 p. Boreal White and Black Spruce (BWBS) White spruce is the predominant tree species in the Boreal White and Black Spruce (BWBS), except in the Fort Nelson area where the poorly drained lowlands are dominated by black spruce. Engelmann spruce is absent, though some white √ó Engelmann hybrids may occur at southern margins of the zone bordering the SBS zone. Mixed stands of white spruce and trembling aspen (often with a minor component of balsam poplar [Populus balsamifera], birch (Betula papyrifera, B. neoalaskana) or lodgepole pine) are the most common components of forest cover on warm mesic sites in the BWBS. On colder sites, e.g., on north-facing slopes, pure white spruce or mixtures of white and black spruces dominate. Lodgepole pine is the typical associate of white spruce on coarse-textured parent materials, while balsam poplar‚Äìspruce mixtures are frequent on floodplains. Subalpine fir is common in western parts of the zone, but is rare east of the Rockies. Wetland black spruce stands often have a minor component of slow-growing white spruce. Typical vegetation in boreal white spruce stands includes the common shrubs Rosa acicularis, Viburnum edule, Shepherdia canadensis, Salix bebbiana, and Alnus viridis, with Ribes triste and Lonicera involucrata on wet sites, and Ledum groenlandicum and Vaccinium vitis-idaea on cold sites. Characteristic herbs are Linnaea borealis, Rubus pubescens, Mertensia paniculata, Petasites palmatus, Pyrola asarifolia, Cornus canadensis and Calamagrostis canadensis, with Equisetum spp. on wet sites. The thick carpet of moss is of Hylocomium splendens, Pleurozium schreberi and Ptilium crista-castrensis, and the lichen Peltigera aphthosa (Coates et al. 1994). Sub-Boreal Pine‚ÄîSpruce (SBPS) White spruce is a distant second in importance to lodgepole pine in the Sub-Boreal Pine- Spruce zone (SBPS). It occurs most commonly in the understorey to pine, but scattered stands dominated by white spruce can be found on moist sites. Pure Engelmann is absent, and any hybrids appear to have mainly white spruce characteristics. Lodgepole pine is the most common associate of white spruce in the SBPS. White spruce also occurs with trembling aspen in seral stands, and mixtures of black and white spruces occupy cold low-lying sites. Floodplain stands of black cottonwood (Populus balsamifera ssp. trichocarpa) and white spruce occur uncommonly. Typical understorey vegetation of moist spruce ecosystems includes the shrubs Lonicera involucrata, Rosa acicularis, Shepherdia canadensis, Juniperus communis, Salix glauca, Betula glandulosa, Ribes lacustre, R. hudsonianum and Viburnum edule, and the herbs Cornus canadensis, Linnaea borealis, Epilobium angustifolium, Petasites palmatus, Fragaria virginiana, Equisetum arvense, Calamagrostis canadensis and Mitella nuda. In addition to the usual feather mosses (Pleurozium schreberi, Hylocomium splendens and Ptilium crista-castrensis) the moss layer characteristically includes Aulacomnium palustre and Peltigera, Cladina and Cladonia lichens (Coates et al. 1994). Sub-Boreal Spruce (SBS) Interior spruce (mostly hybrid white √ó Engelmann, with some pure white spruce) is dominant throughout the many subzones of the Sub-Boreal Spruce (SBS) zone . Lodgepole pine is the most common associate of interior spruce in the SBS. Subalpine fir is abundant in cooler, moister subzones. Trembling aspen and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) are often found with spruce on warmer, drier, more southerly subzones. Black cottonwood is the main associate of interior spruce on active floodplain sites, and mixtures of white and black spruces are common on wetlands. Understorey vegetation in mesic spruce stands typically includes a moderately well-developed shrub layer dominated by Vaccinium membranaceum, Rubus parviflorus, Viburnum edule , Rosa acicularis, Alnus viridis, a variety of herbs (Cornus canadensis, Clintonia uniflora, Rubus pubescens, Rubus pedatus, Arnica cordifolia, Maianthemum racemosa, Orthilia secunda, Aralia nudicaulis) and a well-developed carpet of feathermosses (Pleurozium schreberi, Ptilium crista-castrensis, Hylocomiium splendens, Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus). Wetter spruce sites have Lonicera involucrata, Cornus sericea, Gymnocarpium dryopteris, Tiarella trifoliata, Equisetum arvense and Mnium mosses. Characteristic species of spruce bog, fen, or swamp ecosystems are Salix spp., Betula glandulosa, Ledum groenlandicum, Carex spp. and Sphagnum moss (Coates et al. 1994). Mountain Hemlock (MH) In coastal areas the MH is transitional between productive low-elevation forests and treeless alpine tundra (AT). Unlike the interior high-elevation transition zones (SWB, ESSF), spruce is usually scarce or absent and mountain hemlock is abundant. Yellow cedar is also common, especially in the more maritime areas. The most common fir is Pacific silver fir and subalpine fir may also be plentiful. Fir is absent on Haida Gwaii. Some western hemlock may be present, especially at lower elevations where its proportion of hemlock cover may reach 50%. If western hemlock cover exceeds 50% of total hemlock cover, the site is considered to be within the CWH.R. Green and K. Klinka (1994). A Field Guide for Site Identification and Interpretation for the Vancouver Forest Region Land Management Handbook Number 28, page 68 The westernmost subzone, wet hypermaritime (MHwh) on Haida Gwaii, is atypical for its absence of fir and relative abundance of spruce. In this case the spruce is Sitka spruce, which forms a site series with mountain hemlock and reedgrass on fresh rich sites. Mainland sites formerly mapped as MHwh are being reevaluated.Allen Banner et al (2014). A Field Guide to Ecosystem Classification and Identification for Haida Gwaii. Land Management Handbook Number 68, page 80 Windward moist maritime (MHmm1) is dominated by mountain hemlock and Pacific silver fir. Yellow cedar places third in abundance and western hemlock becomes increasingly significant with decreasing elevation. Leeward moist maritime (MHmm2) has all of the windward tree species, plus subalpine fir. Engelmann Spruce‚ÄîSubalpine Fir (ESSF) Over most of southern British Columbia, spruce dominates the canopy of mature stands in the Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir (ESSF) zone, while subalpine fir is most abundant in the understorey. At higher elevations, particularly in the north and in wet, heavy snowfall areas, subalpine fir dominates and spruce is a minor component. In southern British Columbia, the spruce is pure Engelmann, but white spruce characteristics become increasingly evident northward, first only at lower elevations, then at all elevations. At the northern limits of the ESSF, Engelmann spruce characteristics are rare. Subalpine fir is ubiquitous in the ESSF and is the most common associate of spruce throughout. Lodgepole pine is the most common seral species. Deciduous species, such as trembling aspen, paper birch, and black cottonwood, are present but uncommon. Whitebark pine and, in southeastern British Columbia only, limber pine and alpine larch occur in association with spruce, especially in the driest ecosystems, usually at high elevations, where spruce is not abundant. At low elevations in the ESSF, associates of spruce are Douglas-fir, western redcedar (Thuja plicata), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) and western white pine. Mountain hemlock and amabilis fir (Abies amabilis) are also found with spruce in the ESSF, principally adjacent to the Mountain Hemlock Zone. The dominant plant community in the ESSF has an understorey of ericaceous shrubs, mainly Rhododendron albiflorum, Vaccinium membranaceum, and Menziesia ferruginea, with Vaccinium ovalifolium in high-precipitation areas and V. scoparium in dry areas. Ribes lacustre, Oplopanax horridus and Lonicera involucrata are common shrubs on moist to wet sites. Herbs characteristic of the ESSF forest include Valeriana sitchensis, Gymnocarpium dryopteris, Rubus pedatus, Streptopus roseus, Veratrum viride, Athyrium filix-femina, Cornus canadensis, Lycopodium annotinum, Tiarella spp. and Arnica cordifolia. Dominant bryophytes are Pleurozium schreberi, Dicranum spp., and Barbilophozia spp. Lichens are abundant on the forest floor and include Peltigera spp., Nephroma arcticum, and Cladonia spp. At the upper parkland elevations of the ESSF, closed forest and tree islands of spruce and subalpine fir are interspersed with moist herb meadows and drier ericaceous heath. The meadows typically include the herbs: Valeriana sitchensis, Veratrum viride, Senecio triangularis, Lupinus arcticus, Thalictrum occidentale, Epilobium angustifolium, Pedicularis bracteosum, Castelleja miniata, Erigeron peregrinus, Carex spp. and Luzula spp. Subalpine heath includes Empetrum nigrum, Cassiope mertensiana, C. tetragona, Phyllodoce empetriformis, P. glandulifera, and Vaccinium caespitosum (Coates et al. 1994). Montane Spruce (MS) Browne Lake on a Calm Rainy Morning in late Autumn The MS occurs at mid elevations in the south and central interior in the lee of the coast mountains. Its climate is characterized by cold winters and short warm summers, and is warmer in all seasons than in the Engelmann spruce-Subalpine fir zone. Hybrid spruce and subalpine fir dominate climax forests.http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/thompson/esd/hab/montane_spruce.html Younger (seral) stands are thick with lodgepole pine to such a degree that the species is one of the zone's most important natural resources. Douglas-fir is present, especially in warmer microclimates. Western larch is present in some southeastern areas, and western red cedar may be seen in moist sections. This zone provides important summer and fall habitat for deer and moose and important winter habitat for mountain caribou. Bunchgrass (BG) The Bunchgrass zone is the warmer of the two biogeoclimatic zones in British Columbia which lack trees. It is most commonly found in deeply incised valleys east of the Coast Mountains and within their rain shadow. Drought, not cold as in the Alpine Tundra (AT), minimizes forest or woodland development. Winters are moderately cold throughout the BG, with frequent though usually light precipitation. Incidence and quantity of precipitation decrease after January, and spring months see little rain. A second rain peak occurs in June, but the quantity rarely matches evaporation; therefore, winter is the primary moisture recharge season. Summers are warm in northern parts of the BG, and hot in low- elevation southern areas such as the Thompson River valley between Kamloops and Lytton. The bunchgrass plants tend to be widely spaced. Between them a cryptogam crust is present, and shrub cover under climax conditions may reach 15%. Weeds and cacti often replace bunchgrass on overgrazed land. Although this zone is officially non-forest, trees may be seen here and there. Groves of trembling aspen are occasional at higher elevations, and riparian areas can be lush with aspen, black cottonwood, mountain alder, willows, and many associated understorey plants. Scattered individuals and groves of ponderosa pine form a parkland in some areas, and Douglas-fir can also be present in a similar way. Despite the limited extent of the BG, wildlife density and diversity are very high. This is credited to the juxtaposition of different habitat types‚Äîgrassland, shrub-steppe, riparian, and forest. The BG represents \\"fingers into Canada\\" of the intermontane steppe which is extensive in the Great Basin of the western United States, and as such it is frequented by animal species at their northern limits. These include pallid bat, burrowing owl and short-horned lizard. Their ranges overlap Canadian species near their southern limits, most prominently snowy owl and gyrfalcon.https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/docs/srs/Srs06/chap8.pdf Ponderosa Pine (PP) White spruce or white √ó Engelmann hybrids are found only rarely within the Ponderosa Pine (PP) zone, and occur in cool, moist, sheltered situations, e.g., steep, north-facing canyon headwalls (Coates et al. 1994). Douglas-fir is more common, and can be dominant on moist sites, but mesic or xeric terrain hosts Ponderosa pine as the most abundant species. Two subzones are recognized: the very dry hot (PPxh) around Lytton, Lillooet, Kamloops and the Okanagan Valley south of Vernon, and the dry hot (PPdh) found in or near Midway, Grand Forks, and parts of the Rocky Mountain Trench from just north of Cranbrook south to the Koocanusa Reservoir.https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/docs/srs/srs06/chap9.pdf Interior Douglas-Fir (IDF) aerial view of the Interior Douglas-fir forests of Lake Country Hybrid Engelmann √ó white spruce is secondary to Douglas- fir, and occurs mainly in wetter subzones and at higher elevations transitional to the Montane Spruce, Sub-Boreal Spruce, and Engelmann Spruce‚ÄìSubalpine Fir Zones. The most common associate of spruce is Douglas- fir, which dominates the zone. Lodgepole pine is abundant in the Interior Douglas-fir (IDF) zone but tends to be present only in small amounts on the wetter spruce sites. Western redcedar, western larch, and grand fir (Abies grandis) occur together with spruce, particularly in the southeastern part of the zone. Trembling aspen, paper birch, and black cottonwood are common seral species, and bigleaf maple is present in some parts of the southwestern coastal transition area (wet warm subzone or IDFww). Mixed shrub or horsetail- dominated plant communities are typical of moist, rich ecosystems that include spruce. Common shrub associates include: Ribes lacustre, Lonicera involucrata, Cornus sericea, Rosa acicularis, Symphoricarpos albus and Acer glabrum. The well-developed herb layer contains Linnaea borealis, Cornus canadensis, Aralia nudicaulis, Actaea rubra, and Osmorhiza chilensis, together with Equisetum and Carex spp. on wetter sites. Bog forests with Sphagnum spp., Ledum groenlandicum, and Gaultheria hispidula are infrequent but usually have a tree canopy of pure spruce (Coates et al. 1994). Coastal Douglas-Fir (CDF) Coastal Douglas-fir is often predominant in southern coastal British Columbia, particularly on eastern Vancouver Island, The Gulf Islands, and the Sechelt Peninsula. The climate is \\"Csb\\" Cool Mediterranean, and the droughty summers inhibit development of a climax Western Red Cedar-Grand Fir association. Arbutus or Shore Pine accompany Douglas-Fir on dry, nutrient-poor to medium sites; Garry Oak occupies some dry rich sites, especially around Victoria. Other prominent deciduous trees include Bigleaf Maple and Western Flowering Dogwood. The only official subzone is moist maritime (CDFmm). Interior Cedar‚ÄîHemlock (ICH) Interior spruce is a common secondary component of Interior Cedar-Hemlock (ICH) forests. It is most abundant in the northern and eastern parts of the zone, close to the Sub-Boreal Spruce Zone, or at high elevations bordering the Engelmann Spruce‚ÄìSubalpine Fir Zone. It is least abundant in drier parts of the ICH. White spruce, Engelmann spruce, and their hybrids are all present, Engelmann spruce dominating in southeastern British Columbia, particularly at high elevations, and white spruce dominating in the north. In the coast‚Äìinterior transition of northwestern British Columbia, interior spruce hybridizes with Sitka spruce and their cross is called Roche spruce. The ICH has a greater diversity of tree species than any other interior zone. Western hemlock and western redcedar are climax species in most variants, and interior spruce often accompanies them as a secondary component. Subalpine fir is a major associate to the north. Black cottonwood, lodgepole pine, trembling aspen, and paper birch are found with spruce in seral communities throughout most of the zone. In the central and southern ICH, spruce may also occur in association with Douglas-fir, western larch, western white pine, and grand fir. A typical spruce or redcedar‚Äìspruce stand on a seepage ecosystem has a diverse shrub layer dominated by Oplopanax horridus, Ribes lacustre, Cornus sericea, Acer glabrum, Rubus parviflorus, Viburnum edule, and Lonicera involucrata. Characteristic herbs include Gymnocarpium dryopteris, Athyrium filix-femina, Tiarella unifoliata, Viola glabella, Circaea alpina, Streptopus spp., Osmorhiza chilensis, Dryopteris assimilis, and Actaea rubra. On swampier sites, Lysichiton americanum, Equisetum spp., and Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus and Hylocomium splendens are found. Seral communities on mesic sites in the north of the ICH have a mixed overstorey of spruce, subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, paper birch, and trembling aspen. Typical shrubs are: Rubus parviflorus, Viburnum edule, Rosa acicularis, Paxistima myrsinites, Amelanchier alnifolia, Shepherdia canadensis, Alnus viridis, and Vaccinium membranaceum. Major herbs include: Cornus canadensis, Clintonia uniflora, Aralia nudicaulis, Lathyrus nevadensis, Rubus pubescens, Smilacina spp., Orthilia secunda, Osmorhiza chilensis, and Petasites palmatus. The moss carpet is dominated by Rhytidiadelphus triquetrus, Ptilium crista- castrensis, Pleurozium schreberi, and Hylocomium splendens (Coates et al. 1994). In some subzones either the cedar or the hemlock can be scarce to the point of absence. The ICHdk (dry cool) around Canim Lake and the ICHmk (moist cool) in the Rocky Mountains lack hemlock, while in the northwest the ICHvc (very wet cold) along parts of the Bell-Irving, Iskut and Stikine rivers is beyond the range of cedar.https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/pubs/docs/srs/srs06/chap11.pdf Cedar is also absent, and hemlock locally scarce, in the area mapped as ICHwc (wet cold) around Bob Quinn Lake; forests tend to strongly resemble those of the Sub-Boreal Spruce zone and a Bob Quinn Lake phase (ICHwc(a)) has been proposed.https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfp/silviculture/tss/bec_zones/ichwc.htmlhttps://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hre/becweb/downloads/downloads_subzonereports/ICHwc.pdf Hemlock is easily seen along the Stewart-Cassiar Highway at Thomas Creek, but drops out within a kilometre northward as the hitherto-scarce lodgepole pine becomes abundant; this marks an abrupt change to the BWBS zone. Coastal Western Hemlock (CWH) A very productive rain-fed forest occurs along the British Columbia coast from Haida Gwaii and Stewart south to Metchosin on Vancouver Island.ftp://ftp.for.gov.bc.ca/HRE/external/!publish/becmaps/PaperMaps/field/DSI_SouthIslandResourceDistrict_SouthCoastRegion__field.pdf It also extends inland along river valleys from coastal parts of Alaska, crossing into British Columbia as far north as the Chilkat River.ftp://ftp.for.gov.bc.ca/HRE/external/!publish/becmaps/PaperMaps/field/DCA_CassiarSubunit_SkeenaStikineResourceDistrict_SkeenaRegion_1of4__field.pdf Western hemlock is a dominant climax species throughout. Western red cedar is present from the Craig Headwaters Protected Area south.https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/farming-natural-resources-and- industry/forestry/silviculture/stocking- standards/species/westernredcedarrangelarge.png Douglas-fir is often present and sometimes dominant in warmer, drier sections as far north as Kemano, while Sitka spruce is important in wet areas near tidewater. Other wet-climate trees include yellow-cedar and Pacific silver fir. Red alder is the most abundant deciduous tree, and black cottonwood also thrives in most places. In southern parts, bigleaf maple and western flowering dogwood are locally prominent. The Coastal Western Hemlock zone is divided into subzones along gradients of continentality: * hypermaritime subzones comprise the outer coasts, from Haida Gwaii and Prince Rupert south to Port Renfrew. Hypermaritime forests are characterized by deer fern, yellow-cedar, fern-leaved goldthread, step moss, and lanky moss. * maritime subzones lie farther from the most direct marine influence, including heavily populated southern areas such as (Campbell River, Comox, Courtenay, Port Alberni, Vancouver). Maritime forests are characterized by species including amabilis fir and thinleaf huckleberry. * submaritime subzones are restricted to the leeward side of the Coast Mountains, and are transitional to interior zones. Submaritime forests are characterized by the scarcity of typically coastal species such as salal and yellow-cedar, and the presence of typically interior or continental species like red-stemmed feathermoss and queen‚Äôs cup.

His collection of American Indian art, which was featured between August 2008 and August 2009 in a special exhibition at the Houston Museum of Natural Science entitled Quest for High Bear: A Boy‚Äôs Odyssey Through Indian Country 1925-1939, and has been display at the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History since November 2009, was acquired by the Houston Museum of Natural Science in 2009. Gordon W. Smith was also a publisher, and was an officer in the US Navy during World War II. He died on March 4, 2010, in Fort Worth, Texas.  Life  Born in Fort Worth as the grandson of a pioneer family that had moved to North Texas in the 1870s, Gordon Smith grew up hearing tales of Indians from his grandparents. In 1925, at the age of five, while on a family vacation in Glacier National Park, Montana, Smith met Two-Guns-White-Calf, a Blackfoot chief who gave him a small black rawhide rattle. Meeting Two-Guns-White-Calf began a boyhood odyssey through the American West that would lead to an enduring love for the indigenous cultures of North America. The small rattle was the first object of a collection that grew to over 1000 pieces, almost all of which were collected between 1925 and the beginning of World War II from Indians themselves and from Indian traders. In World War II, he served in the US Navy as captain of two ships in the Pacific. He was made captain of his first ship, LCT 68, in 1943 at age 22, and was spot-promoted to full lieutenant at age 23 upon taking command of his second ship, LSM 37 . As captain of these two ships, he participated in thirteen landings on Japanese-held islands. After the war, he obtained an MA in English literature at Columbia University (‚Äò50), where he also studied studio art with noted Italian sculptor Oronzio Maldarelli. He also had a BA in English literature from Southern Methodist University. In 1950, he founded Smiths, Inc., a publishing house based in Fort Worth, and in 1962, he co- founded Smith Studios with his brother James Hulbert, an architectural arts firm of which he was principal and chief designer. Smith Studios completed over 800 commissioned works in 14 states before it closed upon his retirement in 2003 at the age of 82, to devote himself more fully to cataloging his collection of American Indian materials, painting on American Indian themes, and writing a book on his experiences with Indians. Work  Collection of American Indian Art and Ethnographic Materials = Smith has been noted for his early involvement with America Indians. ‚ÄúMr. Smith had a unique relationship with several American Indian tribes, as is evidenced by the number of gifts he exchanged with them,‚Äù said Dirk Van Tuerenhout, Ph.D., curator of anthropology at the Houston Museum of Natural Science. ‚ÄúHe was their friend during a time when being an American Indian had an extremely negative connotation in the United States.‚Äù Smith‚Äôs parents wholeheartedly supported his interest in American Indians and enabled his amassing of a large collection of Indian art and ethnographic objects in the 1920s and 1930s. From age 5 onward, at least once a year, Smith‚Äôs father, W. D. Smith ‚Äì an attorney and one of the early partners of the Fort Worth law firm Cantey Hangar ‚Äì and his mother Mary Anna took him on trips to visit Indians that often lasted one or two months. In this way, he learned from the Indians themselves about their histories, beliefs, and lifeways, and he collected examples of their material culture ‚Äì objects in many cases given to him by the Indians he knew.Fort Worth Star-Telegram (TX) - April 23, 2006 - G1 Sunday Life HIGH BEAR'S TREASURES, One small gift started Gordon Smith's lifelong interest in American Indians and their art and artifacts. Smith visited every Indian ‚Äúculture area‚Äù of North America. He met Indians, and he learned from them as he collected objects that he knew they valued themselves. During the 1930s he made many friends among Plains Indians, especially among the Lakota Sioux, including still-living elders who had fought the invading white man in the 19th century, but had by then been moved to reservations. As he grew older, he spent longer periods of time with Indians, particularly at Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota. He was inducted in 1934 into the Lakota Sioux tribe at a ceremony in Kansas City, where he was given the Indian name High Bear (Mato Wankantu). Image:Gordon_Smith_with_Indian_elders_ca._1935.JPGGordon W. Smith with Indian elders at Pine Ridge Reservation, ca. 1935 His boyhood sojourns in Indian Country ended with the coming of World War II. Nevertheless, this was only an interlude in his lifelong study of American Indians and their cultures. In the last decade of his life, he completed a book about his experiences, and also painted several works on Indian themes. The first major exhibition drawn from the Gordon W. Smith American Indian collection, entitled Quest for High Bear: A Boy‚Äôs Odyssey Through Indian Country 1925-1939, opened in August, 2008, at the Houston Museum of Natural Science. Objects from the Gordon Smith collection have in the past been on display in the Amon Carter Museum in Fort Worth, the Dallas Museum of Art, and previously at the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History. In September, 2009, the Houston Museum of Natural Science announced that it had acquired the Smith Collection. As steward of the collection, the Houston Museum of Natural Science also announced that it has entered into a cooperative sharing program with the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History. The Fort Worth Museum of Science and History opened the exhibition \\"Quest for High Bear\\" as part of the opening exhibits at its new building in November, 2009, and a program of ongoing loans and exhibits from the Gordon W. Smith American Indian Collection is planned between the Houston Museum of Natural Science and the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History. = Works of Art and Smith Studios = Primarily known for his works of architectural art in the media of stained glass, mosaic, and sculpture, for 41 years Gordon Smith was the principal and chief designer of Smith Studios (previously Smith Stained Glass Studios), an architectural arts firm he founded based in Fort Worth, Texas. Between 1962 and 2003, he designed and created more than 800 commissioned works, including stained glass windows, sculptures, and mosaics in churches, office buildings, and private homes in 14 states. These include a large ‚Äúwall of glass‚Äù installation depicting \\"Creation\\" in the chapel of New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell, NM, and one of the largest mosaic installations ever created in the US, depicting a ‚ÄúCosmic Christ‚Äù on the front of the First Baptist Church of Huntsville, Alabama. That work took 7 years to complete (1966 to 1973), and is approximately one-third the size of a football field. Approximately 1.4 million pieces of Italian tile - none larger than a man's thumbnail - comprise the mosaic, each piece having been set in place by the artist (in some cases with tweezers). Smith‚Äôs final installed work produced at Smith Studios was a stained glass window depicting the story of Noah‚Äôs ark commissioned by Cook Children‚Äôs Health Care System in Fort Worth, and dedicated in 2003. Smith Studios also worked in the area of historical restoration, and completed a number of notable projects including the restoration of the Texas & Pacific Terminal in Fort Worth. In 2002, Smith was awarded the Artisans Award by the Texas Society of Architects for Smith Studios‚Äô work in historical restoration.Fort Worth Star-Telegram (TX) - December 5, 2001 - 1 LIFE & ARTS A touch of glass A retrospective exhibition of Smith‚Äôs work in stained glass and sculpture, as well as works on canvas and on paper, was held in 2004 at the University Gallery at Texas Christian University in Fort Worth.Fort Worth Star-Telegram (TX) - October 23, 2004 - 3F Life & Arts Artistry shines through a glass beautifully, He worked as an artist until his death, and his last works on canvas emphasized American Indian themes. = Work in Publishing = As principal of Smiths, Inc., Gordon Smith published several books in the 1950s, including The Devil Rides Outside, the first novel by Texas author John Howard Griffin, , later noted for his groundbreaking book Black Like Me.

The Zapatista uprising started in January 1994, and lasted less than two weeks before a ceasefire was agreed upon. The principal belligerents of subsection of the conflict were the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (Spanish: Ej√©rcito Zapatista de Liberaci√≥n Nacional; EZLN) and the government of Mexico. Negotiations between the government and Zapatistas led to agreements being signed, but were often not complied with in the following years as the peace process stagnated. This resulted in an increasing division between communities with ties to the government and communities that sympathized with the Zapatistas. Social tensions, armed conflict and para-military incidents increased, culminating in the killing of 45 people in the village of Acteal in 1997 by an anti-Zapatista militia. Though at a low level, rebel activity continues and violence occasionally erupts between Zapatista supporters and anti-Zapatista militias along with the government. The last related incident occurred in 2014, when a Zapatista-affiliated teacher was killed and 15 more wounded in Chiapas.  History and socio-political background  Post-colonial Mexico = After the Mexican War of Independence, Mexico kept many features of its Spanish colonizers, including limpieza de sangre (\\"purity of blood\\"), a legal code that distinguished those of Spanish ancestry from those of indigenous ancestry. This was the starting point for many land rights and social rights struggles in Mexico, some of which can be attributed to the strict structure of Mexican social classes with the Criollo people at the top, who were Mexicans of direct Spanish descent. = Revolutionary Mexico = The same issue appeared amongst the non-Criollo population in later years, especially among the Mestizo population during the 19th century. In the Mexican Revolution of 1910, poor farmers and other marginalized groups, led in part by Emiliano Zapata, rebelled against the government and large land tenants due to failures of the authoritarian regime of Porfirio D√≠az. It is from Zapata that the Zapatistas got their name. = Democratic Mexico = The years after the revolution saw several agrarian reforms, and through Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution the encomienda system was abolished and the right to communal land and other resources for the people of Mexico was granted in accordance with the principles set forth by Zapata. This part of the Constitution more specifically gave the traditionally communal indigenous groups within the country the \\"legal capacity to enjoy common possession of the lands, forests, and waters belonging to them or which have been or may be restored to them.\\"Mexican Const. Art. 27 Thus, the ejido system was created, which organized lands that were able to be worked by various members of rural and indigenous communities, but were often sold off to multinational corporations. The compromise recognized the right of individuals to own private property and of associations, whether Indian or other, to similarly own property, thereby allowing for security, safety, and property of the mostly Spanish upper class whilst elevating Indian and Meztizo groups to equality before the law while simultaneously allowing them to retain their traditional pre-colonial and colonial customs and rights. However, since the issues of material and political equality were more complex than simple Marxist land class problems, rather than instantly bringing about an increase in material wealth and standard of living, the living conditions of most of the country remained as before. This was especially true in the Yucat√°n peninsula where stubborn resistance of the Mayan population along with complex historical development features, kept the geographical area divided between an almost wholly European property owning and wage earning population living along the coasts and certain inland areas and the interior which in essence remained a Mayan country of collective ownership. Consequently, removed from the overall Mexican economic system, the native Mayan Indian nation remained as a free but marginalized underclass much the same as before the revolution. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari = 1980s‚Äì1990s Mexico = Since the 1980s and 1990s, Mexico's economic policy concentrated more on industrial development and attracting foreign capital. However, this policy soon changed to try to brand Mexico as more of an agricultural power, which culminated in the administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari initiating a process of privatization of land through several amendments in 1992, which put the process of determining communal land under federal jurisdiction.Jorge A. Vargas, Mexico's Legal Revolution: An Appraisal of Its Recent Constitutional Changes, 1988-1995, 25 Ga. J. Int‚Äôl & Comp. L. 497 (1996). The EZLN claims that it has existed since 1983, although it only began to gain traction by the early 1990s. Timeline Subcomandante Marcos = Founding = In 1982, General Absalon Castellanos Dominguez, then Governor of Chiapas, increased acts of violent oppression against indigenous people. Members of the National Liberation Forces (FLN), including Rafael Vicente, eventually known as Subcomandante Marcos ‚Äî the eventual spokesman of the EZLN ‚Äî moved into the area later that year, and by late 1983 the EZLN was formed by 3 indigenous people and 3 mestizos. As the group grew, it became more like the state of Chiapas, consisting primarily of indigenous or partly indigenous people. = First Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle (1993) = In December 1993, The Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) issued the First Declaration of the Lacandon Jungle, which declared that the government of Mexico and President Gortari were illegitimate. This declaration was heavily rooted in Emiliano Zapata's Plan of Ayala (1911), which denounced President Francisco Madero and proposed several measures to reform the government. =1994 Zapatista uprising= On 1 January 1994, the EZLN began their military insurrection in the southernmost province of Mexico, Chiapas, in the name of the rights of oppressed indigenous peoples and democracy; this was the same date on which the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect. The EZLN based their operations out of the Lacandon Jungle, and used this as their launching point for capturing the towns of Ocosingo, Las Margaritas, Altamirano, and San Crist√≥bal de las Casas. By 2 January, the rebels had already captured former Governor Castellanos Dominguez, and proceeded hold him hostage due to their own tribunal finding him guilty of anti-indigenous crimes and corruption, and sentenced him to forced labor. By 3 January, the EZLN had lost over 50 of its soldiers, and over 100 civilians had been killed, but had withdrawn from San Crist√≥bal de las Casas, as they could not maintain their grip on it; they had also liberated a government prison with about 180 inmates. During the period of 1‚Äì12 January 1994, there was a large discrepancy between the information released and spread by the two respective sides. The government insisted that there were only a few hundred rebels, while the EZLN reported that they numbered in the thousands.  Initial peace negotiations  The federal government reached a ceasefire agreement with the EZLN on 12 January, and on 17 February the peace negotiators of each party met for the first time, resulting in the freeing of Castellanos Dominguez. Manuel Camacho Solis was the government's chief peace negotiator, Subcomandante Marcos was the EZLN's, and Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia mediated between the two parties. As peace talks continued, there were several high and low points in apparent progress in drafting an agreement, but eventually there was a shift in strategy on the part of the rebels to keep up the talks until the upcoming Mexican Election, to increase the pressure on the government after years of having little to no way to influence government policy or actions. On 11 June, the EZLN rejected the agreement proposed by the Mexican government, but reinforced its commitment to the ceasefire unless the government broke it first. By mid-October, tensions began escalating when the rebels threatened action if the Governor-Elect Eduardo Robledo Rincon of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) were to take office. Subcomandante Marcos also heightened the rhetoric in this situation: \\"If they want lead, we'll give them lead... We are an army, not a labor union or some neighborhood club.\\" =1995 Zapatista crisis and aftermath=Media attention These developments attracted a lot of international attention and criticism. While human rights organizations emphasized the marginalization of the indigenous population, Riordan Roett (adviser to the Emerging Markets Group of the Chase Manhattan Bank) stated in January 1995: > \\"While Chiapas, in our opinion, does not pose a fundamental threat to > Mexican political stability, it is perceived to be so by many in the > investment community. The government will need to eliminate the Zapatistas > to demonstrate their effective control of the national territory and of > security policy.\\" Just 2 days later the Mexican army came into action to bring the Zapatista occupied areas back under their control, but they did not succeed in arresting subcomandante Marcos or other leaders of the EZLN. Peace negotiations In February 1995, the new President, Ernesto Zedillo, attacked the EZLN, which proved to be politically unpopular, resulting in new peace negotiations that culminated in the San Andr√©s Accords of 1996. This treaty indicated an agreement on the importance of indigenous autonomy and land reform. In 1996, the Comisi√≥n de Concordia y Pacificaci√≥n (COCOPA) presented a proposal of constitutional reform (the Cocopa law) based on the San Andr√©s Accords to the EZLN and the federal government. As a gesture of political will to solve the conflict peacefully the Zedillo government signed this proposal, thereby recognizing the indigenous culture and its right to land and autonomy (in concordance with International Labour Organization convention 169, signed by Mexico in 1990). On 21 March 1999, several referendums on the rights of indigenous people were held with support of the EZLN, and the people voted in support of the San Andr√©s Accords, although turnout was low compared to general elections in that time period. =Acteal massacre (1997)= In the months leading up to the Acteal massacre, growing violence resulted in over 6,000 people being displaced, and 25 had been killed in the area. In December, 1997, this culminated in the largest incident of violence of the Chiapas Conflict since the initial rebellion took place in the village of Acteal, in which 45 indigenous people, 15 of whom were children, were murdered by people with machetes and AK-47 assault rifles inside a church. Following the killing, the investigation was led by Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Cu√©llar, and the witnesses/survivors of the Acteal Massacre have said that the attackers were loyalists to the governing PRI. By the end of the month, several people had been charged with the killings, including the de facto mayor of Acteal, Jacinto Arias Cruz, a member of the PRI, resulting in the national party denying any connection to the killings and to the mayor. =PRI power downfall (2000‚Äì2001)= On 2 July 2000, the first non-PRI president was elected, Vicente Fox, ending the PRI's 71 year grip on the office. His campaign focused on increasing economic growth and ending government corruption.  March on the capital (March 2001)  Subcomandante Marcos at the March of the Color of the Earth. In March 2001, about 100,000 supporters of the Zapatistas and the rights of indigenous people mobilized in Mexico City to express their demands of the government; many of the rebels, led by Subcomandante Marcos, traveled for two weeks to reach the site of the political rally. This march was known as the \\"March of the Color of the Earth\\" (Spanish: La Marcha del Color de la Tierra) after a quote by Marcos.Chihu Ampar√°n, A. (2002). La marcha del color de la Tierra. Araucaria. Revista Iberoamericana de Filosof√≠a, Pol√≠tica y Humanidades, 4 (8), 63-79. The Zapatistas expressed support for a Bill of Rights for the nation's minority Indian population and, in his speech to the crowds, Marcos demanded that President Fox \\"listen to us,\\" despite Fox's vocal support for, and initial proposal of, the Zapatista-backed legislation. By the end of April 2001, the Bill was passed by Congress by a wide margin, with Fox's support, but underwent several amendments before it was passed that was criticized by a number of indigenous leaders. The Zapatistas referred to the final version of the law as a \\"betrayal\\" because of its failure to affirm the communal rights indigenous people had to land, other natural resources, and to have autonomous states within Mexico, contrary to the San Andr√©s Accords. =EZLN dialogue suspended (2003)= In response to the passage of the law with its new amendments, the EZLN suspended dialogue with the government and created a new system of leadership, which was necessary to govern autonomously as the San Andr√©s Accords allowed, in principle, and created \\"Good Government Committees (JBG)\\" to do so. =Later developments= The peace process has been in a gridlock ever since, the government officially ignores the EZLN, seeing it just as a political rival, but armed attacks involving pro-government para-military groups frequently make civilian casualties (see the list below). The last violent incident occurred in 2014, with a Zapatista-related teacher killed and 15 more wounded in Chiapas ambush by alleged anti-Zapatista militia; however, there appears to be some dispute as to whether the casualties occurred due to a \\"confrontation\\" or an \\"ambush of unarmed\\" civilians. Social development policies Although and because the Chiapas conflict is intricately linked with low intensity conflict and fourth generation warfare, it is important to stress that the conflict is not only about military or para-military action against armed rebels. Addressing the problems in the region with social development programs are often interpreted by the target group as \\"counter-insurgency light\\"; as a means to divide and rule. Since the creation of the Lacandon Community (1971) and the growing tensions in the region, and even more so since the Zapatista uprising (1994), the government has been faced by three challenges: # preservation of the rainforest in the Lacandon region # combatting poverty & stimulating citizenship among the communities in the Lacandon region # control over the socio-political situation in the Lacandon region These goals have been included in several social development programs. Examples are Programa Solidaridad, Plan Ca√±adas, PIDSS, and Prodesis. =Plan Ca√±adas= Plan Ca√±adas (1994‚Äì2001) (ca√±ada = glen or valley) was conceived after they found guerrilla training camps in the Lacandon Jungle in 1993 (just before the Zapatista uprising). This programme was aimed at suppressing the expected uprising by social means, by giving support to people who were more favourably disposed to the government, and thus ensuring their loyalty to the state. Over time Plan Ca√±adas was criticised for being a counter-insurgency project (\\"counter-insurgency-by-other-means\\", or \\"counter-insurgency light\\") designed in the framework of the low intensity conflict: > \\"It was in the aftermath of the rebellion that the Mexican government began > to devote resources to the region for development, establishing the Ca√±adas > Programme. However, a few years after the initiative was introduced it > became highly criticised because of its counter-insurgent character (it > offered resources in exchange for the abandonment of the Zapatista cause) > and because of its failure in promoting development.\\"Oriol Mirosa-Canal: > Evaluation of the Integral Programme for the Sustainable Development of the > Lacandon Jungle (PIDSS), Mexico 2002; Internship report for the DRC on > Citizenship, Participation and Accountability =PIDSS= Plan Ca√±ada's successor was the Integral Programme for the Sustainable Development of the Jungle: PIDSS (Programa Integral para el Desarrollo Sustentable de la Selva). This project, that started in 2001, was introduced as \\"a joint effort to foster development in a participatory way\\". Goals were to change the relationship between government and society, foster social reconciliation, exclude paternalism, promote participation, and endorse real development projects. The implementation of the programme was achieved through the creation of 34 micro-regions (similar to those under which the Ca√±adas Programme worked). However, PIDSS received much of the same criticism as Plan Ca√±adas: =Prodesis= The follow-up of PIDSS was Prodesis (2004‚Äì2008), an EU-Chiapas cooperation project targeted at 16 of the 34 micro- regions identified by PIDSS. The difficulties this new project encountered were exactly the same as the PIDSS-project stumbled upon: > * It was argued that \\"Prodesis sought participation of the population in a > very limited way\\". * Also there were accounts of \\"counter-insurgency > behaviour of the technicians\\". * Moreover, the fact that Zapatista > Autonomous Municipalities do not desire any relationship with the Mexican > government prevents full participation of the whole target group, leading to > \\"further conflict between and within communities\\". * Finally, it was argued, > Prodesis interpreted the problems in the region along demographic lines, > \\"ignoring the cultural and socio-political history of the region\\" (i.e., the > fact that a large part of the population defends a notion of development > that is opposed to that of the government, and stresses the importance of > land and maintaining their way of life). List of violent incidents (1994‚Äìpresent) Total casualties during the conflict: 105 killed. *January 1‚Äì12, 1994: the initial Zapatista uprising and declaration of war against the Mexican government; 54 killed by Zapatista forces in and around Ocosingo *Throughout 1995 & 1996: Violence in the Northern Zone (assassinations, displacements, ambushes, roadblocks, etc.) in the area of Chil√≥n-Bachaj√≥n, pepetrated by both sides. *14 March 1997: In San Pedro Nixtalucum (Municipality of El Bosque), the state police assault civilians sympathetic to the EZLN, resulting in 4 deaths, 29 wounded, 27 detained and 300 displaced. *4 November 1997: Attack by anti-Zapatista paramilitaries on the bishops of the Diocese of San Crist√≥bal de las Casas near Tila, Northern zone of Chiapas. *End of November 1997: More than 4,500 Indigenous (from \\"Las Abejas\\" and Zapatista sympathizers) fled the violence in the municipality of Chenalh√≥. *22 December 1997: Massacre by right-wing paramilitaries of 45 people, the majority of whom are children and women belonging to the civil group \\"Las Abejas,\\" refugees in Acteal, municipality of Chenalh√≥. *11 April 1998: The autonomous municipality Ricardo Flores Mag√≥n is dismantled in a police and military operation in the community of Taniperlas, municipality of Ocosingo.

The police detain more than 100 community members. *10 June 1998: In a military and police operation to dismantle the autonomous municipality of San Juan de la Libertad, located in El Bosque, 8 civilians and 2 police are killed. *3 August 1998: The Fray Bartolom√© de las Casas Center for Human Rights releases a report that says that in the last 6 months in Chiapas there were registered 57 summary executions, 6 political assassinations and more than 185 expulsions of foreigners. It denounces that in these times there were in the state a number of cases of grave torture, dozens of attempts on the lives of Human Rights Defenders; and against civil organizations and social leaders; and hundreds of military and police actions in the conflict zone. *First two weeks of June 1999: Significant increase in military and police incursions in Zapatista communities; arbitrary detentions of presumed Zapatistas; harassment by military personnel at the military bases; and concentration of troops. Each of the incursions involves the participation of between 100 and 1000 military and police personnel. *26 August 1999: Confrontation between the army and Zapatista support bases in the community of San Jos√© la Esperanza, municipality of Las Margaritas.

NGOs accused the SRA of having divided the population so as to force residents to leave the reserve. *10 April 2004: Zapatista supporters from the municipality of Zinacant√°n were ambushed by members of the PRD, leaving dozens wounded and displacing 125 Zapatista families. *23 April 2004: Noel P√°vel Gonz√°lez, student at the National Autonomous University of Mexico and the National School of Anthropology and History, was found murdered in Mexico City. Elements of the investigation point towards the involvement of the ultra-right group \\"El Yunque.\\" *4 July 2004: Families from the community of San Francisco El Caracol in the Montes Azules Reserve were moved by the government to a \\"new population center\\" called Santa Martha in the municipality of Marqu√©s de Comillas. *23 January 2005: In the municipality of Palenque, 160 Tzeltal families were displaced from the biosphere reserve of Montes Azules to the community of Nuevo Montes Azules. *15 August 2005: The Fray Bartolom√© de Las Casas Human Rights Center once again denounced the forced displacement of several families in the community of Andr√©s Quintana Roo, in the municipality of Sabanilla, due to aggression and threats made by people linked to \\"Development, Peace, and Justice\\" (Spanish: Desarollo, Paz y Justicia) *6 September 2005: A confrontation between Zapatista support bases and the rest of the population in the community of Belisario Dom√≠nguez in the municipality of Salto de Agua. *Mid October 2005: Members of the Organization for Indigenous and Campesino Defense (OPDDIC) were planning to dismantle the autonomous municipality of Olga Isabel, and detain the local authorities. *2 November 2005: In El Limar, in the municipality of Tila in the Northern Zone of Chiapas, over 200 people from eleven communities met to commemorate the more than 120 murdered or disappeared individuals from the region between 1994 and 2000. *5 August 2006: A violent police operation was carried out to expel 30 Zapatista families in the community of the Ch'oles, autonomous municipality El Trabajo (Tumbal√°), in the Northern Zone. *13 November 2006: Violent confrontation in the natural reserve of Montes Azules, Chiapas. Hundreds of armed peasants from the Lacandona Community attack 17 families living in Viejo Velasco Su√°rez. As it happened in a very isolated area, this aggression brought great confusion about the number of victims and their possible belonging to EZLN. Finally the outcome was: 4 people dead (including a pregnant woman) and 4 people disappeared, probably executed. *18 August 2007: A joint police and military operation to evict 39 families (members of the communities of Buen Samaritano and San Manuel, in the municipality of Ocosingo) was conducted in the Biospheric Reserve of Montes Azules. *27 April 2008: At least 500 police violently entered the community of Cruzt√≥n, in the municipality of Venustiano Carranza, Chiapas. *4 June 2008: A military and police incursion in the vicinity of the Zapatista Caracol (local administrative center) La Garrucha, as well as in the support base communities of the EZLN, Hermenegildo Galeana and San Alejandro. *23 July 2008: The Human Rights Center Fray Bartolom√© de Las Casas denounced that state police assaulted campesinos as well as observers from the Other Campaign in the community of Cruzt√≥n, in the municipality of Venustiano Carranza. *3 October 2008: A violent operation carried out by federal and state police left a toll of six dead (4 of whom were executed according to the testimony of community members), 17 wounded, and 36 people detained, almost all of whom were members of the ejido Miguel Hidalgo, located in the municipality La Trinitaria, Chiapas. *2 February 2011: 1 soldier killed, 117 \\"Zapatista sympathizers\\" arrested. *2 May 2014: 1 killed, 15 wounded. *15 to 17 July 2020: Twenty-eight paramilitary attacks against Aldama Municipality. *14 to 17 August 2020: Paramilitary groups from Santa Martha, Chenalh√≥, carry out 26 attacks against villagers in Aldama Municipality, Chiapas. Media influence While the Zapatistas have little physical effect outside of Chiapas, their domination of the \\"information space\\" has strengthened their image and allies from foreign activists and journalists. Because the members of EZLN are residents of Chiapas, living in the jungle, original material for the organization started out as written communiques for media outlets, which were then uploaded to the Internet. Many forums and websites dedicated to the discussion of the Chiapas conflict are sponsored by advocacy groups centered on Latin America and indigenous protection, mostly situated in North America and Western Europe.libcom.org, The Zapatista Effect: The Internet and the rise of an alternative political fabric. Soon after the uprising, fax campaigns and public caravans were popular methods of gaining media attention and organizing supporters.

The work, commenced in 1890 and completed in 1892, was Eakins's first full-length portrait of a woman.The Concert Singer: 1890-1892\\\\. Philadelphia Museum of Art. Retrieved February 22, 2009 It is now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The Concert Singer was one of a series of portraits Eakins painted of Philadelphia natives who were prominent in science and culture, with the intent of producing major showpieces for exhibition. The painting exemplifies Eakins's desire to truthfully record visual appearances with \\"historical value.\\"Of his many full-length portraits, The Concert Singer is one of only two that Eakins painted of women. Sewell et al. 2001, p. 311 Eakins drew, painted, or sculpted at least twenty-two works that dealt with the visual aspects of music; at one point, this included \\"eleven straight portraits of musicians and musicologists\\", of which The Concert Singer has been called \\"the finest\\".Goodrich 1982, vol. II, pp. 83‚Äì84 Composition The work depicts Weda Cook, a \\"respected Camden vocalist... recognized for her 'powerful contralto voice, unassuming manner, and thorough training.'\\"Bohan 2006, p. 128 She stands center stage, wearing pink slippers and a low-necked sleeveless pink dress, a luminous and central element in the picture, fringed with lace and pearl beads. Eakins's realism is notable in the painting of skin tones, with Cook's bare neck, chest, arms, and shoulders visibly paler than her head and hands.Goodrich 1982, vol. II, pp. 84‚Äì85 The figure is solidly and subtly modeled, its warm light pinks set against a cooler and darker yellow- green background.Goodrich 1982, vol. II, p. 86 Narrative details are minimal. In the lower-left foreground, a conductor's hand and baton are visible, although the rest of the figure is not pictured. Initially, as can be seen in the preliminary sketch, the hand grasped the baton as if it were a paint brush. For verisimilitude Eakins had Charles M. Schmitz, the conductor of the Germania Orchestra and Cook's teacher, pose holding the baton.Goodrich 1982, vol. II, page 84.Johns 1983, p. 138 A bouquet at the lower right suggests that the singer is performing an encore;Bohan 2006, p. 138 apparently a fresh supply of roses was provided at each sitting by the sculptor William Rudolf O'Donovan, who had fallen in love with Cook.Wilmerding 1993, p. 118 The floor on which Cook stands recedes into an ambiguous background, and despite several anecdotal elements, the painting is \\"remarkably barren\\",Wilmerding 1993, p. 117 though with enough information to suggest a public performance. Inconsistencies in perspective add to the ambiguity. The lower part of the dress, shoes, and flowers are depicted as if seen from above, yet the visibility of the soles of the shoes and underside of the dress suggest a lower vantage point. The austerity of the composition marks a new and more abstract tendency in Eakins's work, presaging the increasing sense of isolation that would be characteristic of his later portraits.Wilmerding 1993, p. 29 In its design, cropping of details at the lower edges, and low angle of vision, John Wilmerding has likened the painting to the music and dance interiors of Eakins's contemporary, Edgar Degas.Wilmerding 1993, p. 29 Despite formal similarities between The Concert Singer and works by Eakins's French contemporaries, there is a difference in mood: Degas' singers work in cafes, their glamor undercut by garish lighting, and Daumier's essays of the theme are more cynical still.Johns 1983, pp. 130‚Äì131 In contrast, the Eakins painting reflects an American appreciation for singing as a manifestation of high culture.Johns 1983, p. 131 Unidealized, Weda Cook's figure is depicted as substantial and sensuous. It is revealed by a light that creates form, depth, and produces \\"the painting's profoundly poetic mood\\". Compositional history Sketch for The Concert Singer, c. 1890. Oil on canvas, 35.6 cm √ó 27 cm (13 in √ó 10 in). Philadelphia Museum of Art. It is possible that Eakins first saw Cook perform at the Art Students League of Philadelphia on February 22, 1889,Sewell 1982, p. 98 and was inspired to paint The Concert Singer after seeing a photograph of Jules Massenet at an organ, with his wife open-mouthed, singing.Eakins Revealed: The Secret Life of an American Artist by Henry Adams, Thomas Eakins. Illustrated edition. Oxford University Press US, 2005. . Page 351 Though anonymous female (and angel) singers were often shown with their mouths open in medieval and Renaissance art‚Äîas well as in later works such as Degas's Singer with a Glove, 1878‚Äînamed singing artists were nearly always painted and photographed with their mouths closed at this period.Johns 1983, p. 139 So, like many Eakins portraits, The Concert Singer had an element of daring in its composition, although the mouth is not shown fully open.This was not, however, the first time Eakins had painted an open-mouthed singer; The Pathetic Song (1881) featured a young woman singing, accompanied by a cellist and pianist. Homer 1992, p. 117 Prior to painting The Concert Singer, Eakins made a small oil sketch, now also in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Although the sketch lacks the palm and roses, essential compositional modes are already in place, with emphasis on Cook's neck, the color of the dress, direction of light, and general design.Wilmerding 1993, p. 118 It took Eakins nearly two years to paint The Concert Singer. Cook posed for him numerous times, three or four times a week for the first year.Goodrich 1982, vol. II, p. 79 Each time she did, Eakins asked her to sing \\"O rest in the Lord\\" from Felix Mendelssohn's Elijah so he could observe her throat movements; the portrait's specificity is such that some scholars have interpreted Cook as being shown in the act of \\"forming the e sound in the word rest.\\" Sewell et al. 2001, p. 261 The opening bars of the aria are carved in the wooden frame of the painting.Kirkpatrick 2006, p. 384 Eakins later wrote: \\"I once painted a concert singer and on the chestnut frame I carved the opening bars of Mendelssohn's 'Rest in the Lord.' It was ornamental unobtrusive and to musicians I think it emphasized the expression of the face and pose of the figure.\\" This was a practice Eakins also implemented in his Portrait of Professor Henry A. Rowland, in which the painting of the physicist was shown in a frame made by the artist, with carvings of symbols and formulas related to Rowland's work.Sewell 1982, p. 105 Edgar Degas, Singer with a Glove, 1878. \\"With its flattened design....one thinks of the parallel constructions of Edgar Degas's dance and orchestra subjects of the same period.\\"Wilmerding 1993, p. 29 The Concert Singer has been interpreted as a tribute to the poet Walt Whitman, who was warmly admired by both Eakins and Cook, and who was in his final illness at the time the painting was made. Eakins had met the poet in 1887, and completed a portrait of him the following year.Wilmerding 1993, p.109 Weda Cook had set some of Whitman's poems to music, and often performed for him.Bohan 2006, p 129 \\"O rest in the Lord\\" was a particular favorite of the poet, who asked Cook to sing it for him every time they met. Whitman was never far from the thoughts of artist and model as the work progressed; Cook later recalled that Eakins quoted verses from Whitman while she posed.Bohan 2006, p 132 Eakins' portrait of Weda Cook following their reconciliation. The painting was still unfinished when a rift developed between Eakins and Cook; one reason cited was his repeated request for her to pose nude, which Cook refused. Cook later described Eakins's \\"gentleness combined with the persistence of a devil\\", by which he persuaded her to disrobe \\"down to my underclothes\\" (possibly a reference to the \\"classical costume\\" seen in several photographs of Cook and her cousins made ca. 1892 in Eakins's studio).Sewell et al. 2001, pp. 261, 273; Adams 2005, p. 352 However, Cook later wrote that she had broken with Eakins over rumors that he had driven his niece, Ella Crowell, to insanity.At first Crowell's brother informed Cook of Eakins's alleged culpability, but a year later rescinded the accusation. Goodrich 1982, vol. II, p. 136 Eakins finished the painting from Cook's shoes and dress, a circumstance that has been cited to account for a perceived awkwardness in the singer's stance and the placement of her right foot.Wilmerding 1993, p. 117 Eakins and Cook had reconciled by 1895, when she, her husband, and her cousin Maud sat for individual portraits. Provenance The Concert Singer remained in Eakins's possession until his death. It was exhibited several times during his lifetime, but he was unable to sell it. Eakins thought well of the picture, and priced it accordingly: in 1893 and 1895 he asked $1,000 for it, raising the price to $5,000 in 1914.Wilmerding 1993, p. 118 In 1914 Weda Cook asked to purchase the painting, but Eakins replied that he could not part with it because \\"it must be largely exhibited yet\\", and because of its sentimental value to him: \\"I have many memories of it, some happy, some sad\\".Wilmerding 1993, p. 117; Bohan 2006, p. 139 After his death the painting was appraised for only $150.Wilmerding 1993, p. 118 The painting was given to the Philadelphia Museum of Art in 1929 by Eakins's widow Susan Macdowell Eakins (1851‚Äì1938), and Miss Mary Adeline Williams, the latter a close friend who lived with Eakins and his wife for long periods.

Plot The film chronicles the experience of a gay Swedish couple, Sven (Torkel Petersson) and G√∂ran Skoogh (Gustaf Skarsg√•rd) as they move into a new suburban neighborhood and adopt a child, beginning with their welcoming party. After meeting their new neighbors and settling into their jobs, they decide to adopt a child. Although they are married, no country is willing to let a gay couple adopt any of its children. After initially being turned down by the adoption agency, a Swedish orphan becomes available, whom they readily agree to adopt. However, a typographical error on the papers changed the child's age from \\"15\\" to \\"1.5\\". When their new son Patrik (Tom Ljungman) arrives, they are shocked to find him a troubled teenager with a criminal background. Hurrying to the adoption agency to rectify the error, they arrive to find there is nothing that can be done until the next week. Over the next few days, Sven is appalled by Patrik's insulting behavior, even though G√∂ran sees the good in him. Patrik is initially fearful of both men, believing stereotypes that gays are pedophiles. Once the agency reopens, all three are told by the officials that Patrik's only options are living with them or returning to the foster center where he came from. After living up to his troublemaking habits, Patrik causes Sven to leave in disgust over G√∂ran's unwillingness to kick Patrik out. G√∂ran agrees to look after Patrik until the agency can find a suitable home for him. Over the next few days, Patrik reveals his talent for gardening, and G√∂ran grows to accept him. After several weeks, the agency notifies G√∂ran that a family has been found for Patrik, who by this time has gotten past his initial fear and contempt for his surrogate parents. Sven returns as he and G√∂ran both realize their issues were not worth ending their relationship. Patrik's new father arrives to pick him up, and he leaves with him. After a short time, Patrik returns, and the three then live together permanently. Cast * Gustaf Skarsg√•rd as G√∂ran Skoogh * Torkel Petersson as Sven Skoogh * Tom Ljungman as Patrik * Anders L√∂nnbro as Urban Adler Release The film was shown at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival and the 2009 London Lesbian and Gay Film Festival. It was screened to a sold-out cinema at the Seattle International Film Festival for the festival's annual \\"Gay-la\\" event. It is the opening night film at the 2009 Inside Out Film and Video Festival, and was a centerpiece film for Frameline in San Francisco in June 2009. It was the closing film at the Dublin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival (GAZE) in August 2009 and at the Glasgay! Film Festival in October 2009. Also screened at the Hong Kong Lesbian and Gay Film Festival and the Rehoboth Beach Film Festival (where it placed 3rd for Best Feature) in November 2009, and at the 25th Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in Ljubljana, Slovenia, in early December 2009, where a discussion was held with director Ella Lemhagen after the sold-out (closing) screening at the Slovenian Cinematheque. Production Patrik, Age 1.5 is technically based on a stage production; however, director Ella Lemhagen didn't like the script of the play all that much, and decided to just use the film's pitch and to build up a new story from scratch. While doing so, she interviewed the first Swedish gay couple given permission to adopt, in 2003, and who by 2010 were still waiting to actually adopt. Reception The film received generally positive reviews from critics. Based on 17 reviews, it holds a 71% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Jeanette Causulis from The New York Times said in her review that \\"Deftly combining low-key romance and gentle humor, the director, Ella Lemhagen (working from Michael Druker's 2008 play), stares down prejudice with a nudge and a wink rather than a soapbox.\\"Movie Review - 'Patrik, Age 1.5' Kevin Thomas from the Los Angeles Times wrote \\"This most observant and involving film has three strengths: It shows that a strongly family-oriented, middle-class suburbia is initially hardly idyllic for gays; the arrival of Patrik reveals fissures in Sven and Goran‚Äôs relationship; and that Lemhagen, who plays against predictability at every turn, maintains suspense right up to the final minutes as to how everything may turn out for the three.\\" Chuck Wilson from The Village Voice wrote ‚ÄúOne is never bored, thanks to the innate charms of Gustaf Skarsg√•rd and young Ljungman.‚Äù Sources * Review by Brent Hartinger in AfterElton: \\"If You See Only One Gay Indie Movie This Year, Make It Patrik, Age 1.5\\" ReferencesExternal links   \\"It's a Wonderful Life‚Ä¶Isn't It?\\" a Bluefat review Category:2008 films Category:2000s comedy-drama films Category:Swedish films Category:Swedish comedy-drama films Category:Swedish-language films Category:Swedish LGBT-related films Category:Swedish independent films Category:Here TV original programming Category:LGBT-related comedy-drama films Category:2008 LGBT-related films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:Films directed by Ella Lemhagen Category:Films about adoption Category:2008 independent films Category:2008 comedy films Category:2008 drama films ","title":"Patrik, Age 1.5"},{"id":"21664331","text":"The Nikkor 13mm 5.6 is an ultra-wide angle rectilinear lens which was manufactured by Nikon for use on Nikon 135 film format SLR cameras until 1998, at which time it was discontinued. It has been dubbed 'The Holy Grail', for its low-distortion ultra-wide capabilities. The lens was produced by Nikon only upon receipt of an order, thus making it one of the Nikon lenses with the least number manufactured.  Introduction  As a highly perfected rectilinear lens, straight lines are rendered perfectly straight (while a similar focal length Fish-Eye lens will distort such lines). This photograph was taken at the Getty Villa in Pacific Palisades, CA with the 13mm Nikkor. The lens was prototyped in 1973 and released on an 'order only' basis from March 1976. It was designed by Mr Ikuo Mori, First Optical Section, Optical Designing Department (now retired) and built in Japan.  Features  * Very little distortion (less than typical 50 mm normal lenses) and lateral chromatic aberration. * Close Range Optical Correction (CRC) system: floating lens elements are used to reduce aberrations at close focusing distances.  Construction  * 16 lens elements in 12 groups * Extreme retrofocus optical design with backfocus of more than three times the focal length. * Triplet/Tessar type master lens group behind the aperture. * Wide-angle lens group in front of the aperture to reduce the image size.  Versions  * Nikkor F 13mm 5.6 - March 1976 (non-AI). Serial numbers began with: 175021. * AI Nikkor 13mm 5.6 - June 1977. Serial numbers began with: 175055. * AIS Nikkor 13mm 5.6 - March 1982.

The company replaced this lens in 2016 with a version offering the same focal length range but a constant maximum aperture of f/4. * The Sigma 8‚Äì16mm, introduced in 2010, a rectilinear ultra-wide zoom designed for DSLRs with APS-C sensors, providing essentially the same 35mm equivalent field of view as the company's 12‚Äì24mm offering on full-frame. * The Canon EF 11‚Äì24mm, introduced in 2015, a rectilinear ultra-wide zoom designed for the company's full-frame DSLRs.

Bandemer, 478 U.S. 109 (1986), is a case in which the United States Supreme Court held that claims of partisan gerrymandering were justiciable, but failed to agree on a clear standard for the judicial review of the class of claims of a political nature to which such cases belong. The decision was later limited with respect to many of the elements directly involving issues of redistricting and political gerrymandering, but was somewhat broadened with respect to less significant ancillary procedural issues. Democrats had won 51.9% of the votes, but only 43/100 seats. Democrats sued on basis of one man, one vote, however, California Democrats supported the Indiana GOP's plan.

DAVIS, et al., Appellants, v. Irwin C. BANDEMER, et al., Appellees., 1985 (U.S.). Background Democrats in the state of Indiana challenged the state's 1981 state apportionment scheme for Indiana General Assembly districts because of political gerrymandering. The Democrats argued that \\"the apportionment unconstitutionally diluted their votes in important districts, violating their rights.\\" Indiana Democrats used the elections of November 1982 as proof that the new plan violated the 14th amendment due to voter dilution. In both the House and the Senate Democrats won the majority of votes, but failed to have a majority of candidates win. The District Court ruled in favor of the Democrats, throwing out the old plan and calling for the creation of a new one.  Decision  The Supreme Court ruled on two separate issues, first whether gerrymandering claims are justiciable and secondly, if the 1981 Indiana Reapportionment Plan was an infraction on citizen's rights to equal representation which was protected by the 14th Amendment.. The Court ruled 6-3 that federal courts can determine cases of partisan gerrymandering as worthy of intervention, but they also ruled 7-2 that Indiana's plan was constitutional under the Equal Protection Clause.

Early TNA DVDs had no major distributor and were produced and distributed by TNA through their official website. History Prior to TNA officially forming TNA Home Video, TNA did not have a distribution partner and therefore released six DVDs exclusively on their website. In 2003 TNA released their first three DVDs and in early 2004 TNA released three more DVDs. TNA originally held weekly pay- per-views from 2002‚Äì2004. In 2004 however, TNA changed their format to a weekly free television show known as Impact! as well as monthly three-hour PPVs.

Biography Baca-Flor was born in the port of Islay, Arequipa, in the south of Peru. After his first birthday, his family moved to Santiago, Chile. In Santiago, Baca-Flor did his first studies, showing a talent for art which was encouraged by his parents. When Baca-Flor was 13 years old, his father died; he was placed under the care of his cultured and generous mother Julia. Every Friday, she invited 12 poor children to their house and personally looked after them. Their life was hard, and they spent days without eating for lack of money. To earn a living, his mother taught piano to children in wealthy Santiago. In Chile, Baca-Flor was extremely close to his friends and teachers. When he was in the Academia de Artes de Santiago he was just a teenager, impetuous and full of ideas. Students in years above him called him \\"the critical\\" (el cr√≠tico) because he found the defects in their work. Always excelling, he won the gold medal in painting, sculpture, and drawing every year. At the end of his studies, he received the Rome Prize, a special award for having won the last three contests in a row. On the podium the day of the awards, the rector of the Academia de Artes offered to naturalize him, since being Chilean was a requirement for the award. Baca-Flor declined the offer, saying he could not betray his homeland, and left the ceremony immediately. He arrived in Paris in 1890 with the help of the Peruvian government. There he met the Spanish master Francisco Pradilla, who directed the Academia Espa√±ola de Bellas Artes of Roma, and he was a close friend of the Catalan young painter Hermen Anglada Camarasa. In 1907, he won first place in the annual salon of French artists; sixty critics unanimously declared him the winner. His work was exhibited in the \\"Salon of Honor\\". The next year, he met John Pierpont Morgan, the American banking magnate. That year, Morgan had been visiting the clothes designer for his family, the famed Mr. Worth. Entering the tailor's workshop, he saw on the back wall a painted portrait of Worth, and exclaimed, \\"Incredible... I should meet him; I never thought I would find a painter who could paint my portrait\\" (Incre√≠ble... Debo conocerlo, jam√°s pens√© encontrar a un pintor que pudiera retratarme). Morgan visited Baca-Flor accompanied by Count Le√≥n Molk, a friend of Baca-Flor and relative of Morgan. Morgan introduced himself to Baca-Flor and requested that Baca-Flor paint his portrait. For nearly two years, Baca- Flor traveled to the United States to paint Morgan; over time, they became friends. Baca-Flor's life ended with fame and professional success. He died in France in summer 1941. A good collection of his works is conserved at the Museu de Terrassa, an old town near Barcelona.

Donovan, 53, Dies, nytimes.com, access date 5 June 2015 was an American lawyer and United States Navy officer in the Office of Scientific Research and Development and the Office of Strategic Services (OSS, predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency), ultimately becoming general counsel of the OSS, and an international diplomatic negotiator. Donovan is widely known for negotiating the 1960‚Äì1962 exchange of captured American U-2 pilot Francis Gary Powers for Soviet spy Rudolf Abel, and for negotiating the 1962 release and return of 9,703 prisoners held by Cuba after the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion. Donovan was portrayed by Tom Hanks in the 2015 feature film Bridge of Spies. Early life and early career James Britt Donovan was born into an Irish American family on February 29, 1916, in the Bronx. He was the son of Harriet (n√©e O'Connor), a piano teacher, and John J. Donovan, a surgeon. His brother was New York state senator John J. Donovan Jr. Both sides of the family were of Irish descent. He attended the Catholic All Hallows Institute. In 1933, he began his studies at Fordham University, where he completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1937. He wanted to become a journalist but his father convinced him to study law at Harvard Law School, beginning in autumn of 1937, where he completed his Bachelor of Laws degree in 1940. After graduating from law school, Donovan started work at a private lawyer's office. He was a commander in the Navy during World War II. In 1942, he became associate general counsel at the Office of Scientific Research and Development. From 1943 to 1945, he was general counsel at the Office of Strategic Services.

In 1950, Donovan became a partner in the New York-based law office of Watters and Donovan, specializing in insurance law. Release of Gary Powers In 1957, Donovan defended the Soviet spy Rudolf Abel in what was known as the Hollow Nickel Case after many other lawyers refused.The Man Who 'Sprung' Powers in: The Milwaukee Journal, 16 February 1962, page 8 He later brought in Thomas M. Debevoise to assist him. Abel was convicted at trial, but Donovan was successful in persuading the court not to impose a death sentence. He appealed Abel's case to the Supreme Court, which in Abel v. United States rejected by a 5‚Äì4 vote Donovan's argument that evidence used against his client had been seized by the FBI in violation of the Fourth Amendment. Chief Justice of the United States Earl Warren praised him and publicly expressed the \\"gratitude of the entire court\\" for his taking the case. In 1962, Donovan, who was lead negotiator, and CIA lawyer Milan C. MiskovskyThe People of the CIA ‚Ä¶ Milan Miskovsky: Fighting for Justice, cia.gov, access date 5 June 2015 negotiated with Soviet mediators to free captured American pilot Francis Gary Powers.

On December 21, 1962, Castro and Donovan signed an agreement to exchange all 1,113 prisoners for $53 million in food and medicine, sourced from private donations and from companies expecting tax concessions. Donovan had the idea to exchange the prisoners for medicine after he had found out that the Cuban medicine didn't help him with his own bursitis.James Britt Donovan in: Der Spiegel 23/1963, pahe 82 By the end of the negotiations, July 3, 1963, Donovan had secured the release of 9,703 men, women and children from Cuban detention.

In popular culture  The story of the Abel trial and defense, followed by the negotiation and prisoner exchange, was the basis for the book Strangers on a Bridge: The Case of Colonel Abel and Francis Gary Powers, written by Donovan and ghost writer Bard Lindeman, which was published in 1964. Several similar works would come later, but Strangers was the definitive work and was widely critically acclaimed. The book was re-released by Simon & Schuster in August 2015.

It is the fourth episode of the Commander Keen series. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, in an adventure in his dreams as he journeys through a vegetable kingdom to defeat the evil potato king Boobus Tuber and free enslaved children from the Dream machine. The game features Keen running and jumping through various levels while opposed by various vegetable enemies; unlike the prior three episodes, Keen does not use a pogo stick to jump higher, and throws flower power pellets to temporarily turn enemies into flowers rather than shooting a raygun to kill them. After the success of Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, the developers of the game, including programmers John Carmack and John Romero, designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack, left their jobs at Softdisk to found id Software. As part of a settlement for using company resources to make their own game, the group agreed to make several games for Softdisk's Gamer's Edge subscription service. As a part of fulfilling this obligation, id made Keen Dreams as a prototype to develop ideas for their next major Keen game, Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy. These ideas included gameplay changes, graphical enhancements like parallax scrolling, and artistic improvements. Keen Dreams was not as widely played or noted as the other Keen games, and as it was owned by Softdisk was included in only one of the several compilation releases of the series by id or regular publisher Apogee Software; as a result, it became known as the \\"lost episode\\" of the series. In 2013 a port was developed by Super Fighter Team for Android devices. A 2014 Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign led to the original source code being published and a release by Hard Disk Publishing through Steam for Microsoft Windows and Linux in 2015, and OS X in 2016. A Nintendo Switch version by Lone Wolf Technology was released in 2019. Gameplay Gameplay image from the game, showing Commander Keen and a potato \\"Tater Trooper\\" enemy. To the left of Keen are two flower power pellets, while the box in the upper left shows the player's score, lives, and flower power ammo. Commander Keen in Keen Dreams is a side- scrolling platform video game: the majority of the game features the player- controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two- dimensional plane. The player character can move left and right and can jump; unlike the prior trilogy of episodes in the series, known collectively as Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, Keen cannot jump higher using a pogo stick. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from slightly above so as to give a pseudo-3D effect, and some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below, while others feature fireman's poles that Keen can climb up or down. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, though unlike in Vorticons the player can save their game at any point. In between levels the player travels on a two- dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance or save their progress in the game. Some levels are optional to enter and may be bypassed. Levels include a variety of anthropomorphic vegetable enemies, such as potatoes and squash, each with different movement patterns and attacks. Levels can also include hazards, such as water or spikes; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. Unlike the previous game, Keen can not shoot enemies with a raygun; instead he collects small pellets throughout the levels called flower power to throw at enemies. If an enemy is hit, they transform into a passive, intangible flower for a limited time, while pellets that do not hit an enemy can be retrieved by the player. The player can also find food items in the form of sweets throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded if the player earns enough points, as well as figures of Keen that grant an extra life. Placed throughout the levels are collectible bombs, which the player must use at least twelve of in order to defeat the final boss of the game. Plot Having defeated the Grand Intellect in Invasion of the Vorticons and saved the Earth, eight-year-old child genius Billy Blaze is still forced by his parents to eat his vegetables at dinner. After being sent to bed, he falls asleep and wakes up in his pajamas in bed on top of a hill. Giant helmet-wearing potato men tell him that their king Boobus Tuber has brought him to their land with his Dream Machine, and Keen is now his slave. Keen puts on his Commander Keen helmet and defeats the vegetables, but finds that his raygun is now out of charge. Another child in chains runs up to him and asks Keen to defeat Boobus Tuber and save them all from the Dream Machine, and Commander Keen agrees to do so. After journeying through several outposts and cities of Tuberia, defeating various types of vegetable creatures, and collecting Boobus Bombs along the way to attack Boobus Tuber with, he reaches the castle on top of Mount Tuberest. Upon defeating Boobus Tuber and turning off the Dream Machine, Keen wakes up in bed at home, where his mother informs him it is national \\"I Hate Broccoli\\" day. Development In October‚ÄîDecember 1990, a team of employees from programming studio Softdisk, calling themselves Ideas from the Deep, developed the three-part video game Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons. The group, who worked at Softdisk in Shreveport, Louisiana developing games for the Gamer's Edge video game subscription service and disk magazine, was composed of programmers John Romero and John Carmack, designer Tom Hall, artist Adrian Carmack, and manager Jay Wilbur. After the release of the game in December, and the arrival of the first US$10,500 royalty check from shareware publisher Apogee Software, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss and owner of Softdisk Al Vekovius confronted them on their plans, as well as their use of company resources to develop the game‚Äîthe team had created the game on their work computers, both in the office after hours and by taking the computers to John Carmack's house on the weekends‚Äîthe team made no secret of their intentions. Vekovius initially proposed a joint venture between the team and Softdisk, which fell apart when the other employees of the firm threatened to quit in response, and after a few weeks of negotiation the team agreed to produce a series of games for Gamer's Edge, one every two months. Ideas from the Deep, now founded as id Software, used some of these games to prototype ideas for their own releases, such as Catacomb 3-D. In late spring of 1991 they worked on a new Keen game in order to develop new systems for their next major release in the Commander Keen series. They did not initially want to do a Keen game for Softdisk, but eventually decided that doing so would let them fulfill their obligations while also helping improve the next full set of games for Apogee. For Invasion of the Vorticons, John Carmack and Romero focused exclusively on the programming, while Adrian Carmack joined late in development and had a personal art style that did not match with the game. As a result, the game was largely shaped by designer Tom Hall's personal experiences and interests. Keen's red sneakers and Green Bay Packers football helmet were items Hall wore as a child, dead enemies left behind corpses due to his belief that child players should be taught that death had permanent consequences, and enemies were based loosely on his reading of Sigmund Freud's psychological theories, such as that of the id. For Keen Dreams, the team reprised their roles, and used the game as a prototype for what they wanted to change for the next Keen games for Apogee: an increase in graphical quality with parallax scrolling to make the background move at a different speed than the foreground, a pseudo-3D view rather than a side-on view, ramps rather than solely flat surfaces, support for sound cards, and changes to the design based on player feedback. The game's plot, as a result, was designed to be a standalone game outside of the continuity of the main series, and not a true sequel. John Carmack in 2006 For Vorticons, Carmack had created adaptive tile refresh to produce a scrolling effect on computers not powerful enough to redraw the entire screen when the player moved. For Keen Dreams, he wanted to scroll the background at a different rate than the foreground, but again computers of the time were not powerful enough to do so smoothly. To implement parallax scrolling without having to manage all of the elements moving past each other, he came up with a plan to instead save combinations of overlapping foreground and background elements in memory and display the appropriate combination for where Keen was on the screen, so that the game only needed to pick the correct image rather than recalculate what that image would be. Hall, meanwhile, had received feedback from parents who did not like that the enemies in Vorticons left behind corpses instead of disappearing like in other games; he did not want the violence to have no effects, and so in Dreams replaced the raygun with pellets that temporarily stunned enemies. He was not satisfied with this change, and for the next games added in a stun gun instead. He also removed the pogo stick from the game, both to symbolize that Keen was in a nightmare and therefore felt less empowered, and also to make designing the levels easier as vertical motion did not need to be as accounted for. Once the parallax scrolling and design changes were completed, Keen Dreams was completed in less than a month even as the team simultaneously worked on another game. The level maps were designed by Tom Hall and John Romero, using a custom-made program called Tile Editor v5.0 (TED5), which they used for the entire Keen series as well as several other games. Bobby Prince had planned out an introductory cinematic with an accompanying song titled \\"Eat Your Vegetables\\", but it was rejected as it would have made the game too large to fit on a single floppy disk. The story introduction was instead done in plain text, and \\"Eat Your Vegetables\\" was repurposed as stage music for Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy. Legacy As one of a series of minor PC releases from the small publisher Softdisk, Keen Dreams did not receive much attention from contemporary reviewers or players, despite its connection to the Commander Keen series. Accordingly, it has since been marketed as the \\"lost episode\\" of the series. As it fell between the 1990 episodes 1‚Äì3 of the Vorticon trilogy, and the 1991 episodes 4‚Äì5 of Commander Keen in Goodbye, Galaxy, Keen Dreams has also been informally referred to as \\"Episode 3.5\\" of the series. Keen Dreams was also marketed by Softdisk as part of \\"The Lost Game Collection of ID Software\\". Keen Dreams was included with the other series games in the 1996 id Anthology compilation release, but as the game had not been published through Apogee, Keen Dreams was not included in the 1998 Apogee Commander Keen compilation release or the 2014 3D Realms Anthology release. In June 2013, however, developer Super Fighter Team licensed the game from Flat Rock Software, the then-owners of Softdisk, and released a version for Android devices. The following September, an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign was started to attempt to buy the rights from Flat Rock for US$1500 in order to release the source code to the game and start publishing it on multiple platforms; while the campaign did not reach the goal, the creator Javier Chavez made up the difference, and the source code was released soon after. The game was then published on Steam through the Steam Greenlight program by Hard Disk Publishing for Microsoft Windows, OS X, and Linux, with Steam achievements and multiple graphical options. According to Steam Spy, approximately 80,000 copies have been sold through Steam as of June 2016. In February 2019, Lone Wolf Technology released a version on the Nintendo Switch console.

Palmer Productions and published by Activision in May 2001 for the Game Boy Color. Part of the Commander Keen series, it was released ten years after the first seven episodes in 1990‚Äì91. The game follows the titular Commander Keen, an eight-year-old child genius, as he journeys through three alien worlds to collect three plasma crystals to prevent the weapon they power, built by several enemies from previous games, from destroying the universe. The game features Keen running, jumping, and shooting through various levels while opposed by aliens, robots, and other hazards. The original games of the Commander Keen series were developed by id Software, but after the success of their 3D first-person shooters such as Wolfenstein 3D (1992) and Doom (1993), they canceled the planned future episodes in the series. In 1999, founder John Carmack remarked that he was considering making a Game Boy Color game for the series, and sometime afterwards id approached Activision with the idea. Activision recommended David A. Palmer Productions to develop the game, as they had been proposing to make Game Boy Color versions of id's other games, and Palmer proceeded to make the game with oversight from id. The game was announced in April 2001 and released soon after. It received mixed reviews from critics, who gave varied opinions on the quality of the game's graphics and the suitability of the ten-year-old computer-based gameplay on a modern handheld game console, and generally found the game best suited for fans of the original series or younger players. Gameplay Keen standing in a level on Fribbulus Xax; a Bloog enemy is approaching from the left, while two point items are in the upper right. Unlike prior games, no display is given during a level to show the player's current points or lives Commander Keen is a side- scrolling platform video game: the majority of the game features the player- controlled Commander Keen viewed from the side while moving on a two- dimensional plane. The player can move left and right and can jump, and can use a pogo stick to bounce continuously and jump higher than they can normally with the correct timing. The levels are composed of platforms on which Keen can stand, viewed from the side as in the original Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons trilogy, and some platforms allow Keen to jump up through them from below. The game also includes moving platforms and teleporters that Keen can respectively jump on and interact with. In between levels, the player travels on a two-dimensional map, viewed from above; from the map, the player can enter levels by approaching the entrance. Once entered, the only way to exit a level is to reach the end, or by resetting the game. When a level is completed, the player is given a password that records their progress, lives, and points; this password is entered when starting the game in order to resume where the player left off. The game is divided into three worlds, connected by a central hub area where the game begins and where Keen starts whenever a password is entered. The levels contain a variety of enemies, which the player must stun, destroy, or avoid; these are primarily different alien creatures. Levels can also include hazards, such as spikes or fire; touching a hazard or most enemies causes Keen to lose a life, and the game is ended if all of Keen's lives are lost. The game features three difficulty settings, which change the number and types of enemies present. While the raygun in Vorticons killed enemies, and the stun gun in Goodbye, Galaxy and Aliens Ate My Babysitter permanently stunned them, Keen's Neural Ray Blaster in this game only temporarily stuns enemies, who must then be jumped on with the pogo stick to be killed or destroyed. Stunned enemies can be bypassed until they wake up again, and unlike prior games the blaster does not require collectible ammo, though only one shot can be fired at a time. The player can also find food items throughout the levels which grant points, with an extra life awarded with enough points. There are also items which award an extra life once enough have been collected, colored keycard gems which grant access to locked parts of levels, and items which instantly grant an extra life. Plot In the prologue to the game, as detailed in the game's manual, eight-year-old child genius Billy Blaze is preparing to eat his cereal and watch television when the set displays nothing but static. A sub-space anomaly has mysteriously appeared in the Earth's core, and is disrupting life all over the planet. Donning his helmet as Commander Keen, Billy rushes off to discover what is affecting the Earth. He flies to the source, only to discover that the Shikadi from Goodbye, Galaxy, the Bloogs from Aliens Ate My Babysitter, and his \\"old enemies\\" the Droidicus‚Äînot present in a previous game‚Äîhave joined forces and are working with his arch-rival Mortimer McMire. Together they created the Omegamatic Warp Drive, powered by three plasma crystals, to destroy the universe. Keen immediately sets off to find the crystals on the three planets linked to the Omegamatic: Droidicus Prime, Shikadi, and Fribbulus Xax. Upon retrieving all three plasma crystals and destroying the Omegamatic Warp Drive, Keen is confronted by McMire, who tells him that he will not be so lucky the next time before teleporting away; Keen responds that he still defeated McMire, and will make it home in time for dinner. The game then congratulates the player on winning, and warns that with McMire still at large, Keen never knows when he will be called on again to defend the Earth. Development The Commander Keen series originated in 1990 when John Carmack, then a game programmer at Softdisk, devised a method called adaptive tile refresh to produce smoothly scrolling graphics for a 2D platform video game engine on IBM PC compatible general-purpose computers. Using this engine, they created a PC demo clone of Super Mario Bros. 3, but were unable to interest Nintendo in it. Carmack and a group of his coworkers from Softdisk‚Äîincluding programmer John Romero, designer Tom Hall, and artist Adrian Carmack‚Äîused their tile scrolling technique to make an original trilogy of shareware episodes for publisher Apogee Software. The game, Commander Keen in Invasion of the Vorticons, was a large success for the market, and led the group to quit their jobs and found id Software. The game was followed by four more episodes during 1991: Keen Dreams, a pair titled Goodbye, Galaxy, and Aliens Ate My Babysitter. Further plans were made for another trilogy to be produced in 1992 under the name The Universe is Toast, but before any work began it was canceled due to the success of id's Wolfenstein 3D and development focus on Doom. Id did not return to the series afterwards, instead continuing to focus on 3D first- person shooters. In October 1999 during an online question and answer session, John Carmack, while discussing that the original founders of id Software were unlikely to ever work together on a game again, mentioned that he was considering the idea of making a Commander Keen game for the Game Boy Color handheld game console. IGN, when reporting the statement, mentioned that the idea was not unfeasible, especially given that another 1991 side-scroller, Apogee's Duke Nukem, had just been ported to the same platform. No further mention was made of such a game until April 2001, when id CEO Todd Hollenshead said that such a game had been created, and had been submitted to Nintendo for approval. Activision formally announced at the start of May that a new Commander Keen game had been developed by David A. Palmer Productions, and would be released at the end of the month. An interview the following week with founder David A. Palmer explained that the original idea for the game came from id, who approached Activision to produce it; Activision in turn recommended Palmer as the developer for the project. Palmer greatly admired id's games, and had been attempting to get an agreement with id and Activision for several years for his studio to make a Game Boy Color version of several of their games, such as the 1993 Doom or 1996 Quake. While Palmer was the developer for the game‚Äîwith Palmer himself serving as the producer, Jim Meston as lead artist, and Mark Cooksey as composer‚Äîid collaborated with the studio, with id having approval over game design elements and artist Adrian Carmack making some tile artwork for the game. Though the game was initially reported as a \\"remake\\" of the originals, Activision announced it as \\"based on\\" the original series. This was further elaborated on in the David A. Palmer interview, who clarified that the game incorporated elements from multiple games in the series, with care taken to keep them as similar as possible to the original games; he noted that it did not include elements from some games, like Keen Dreams, where id did not hold the rights. Reception Commander Keen received mixed reviews from critics. The graphics were both praised and criticized; Jason White of AllGame praised the art style and the \\"bright and colorful\\" graphics, and Peter Sellers of IGN similarly praised the graphical upgrade over the original computer games and the colorful style, but Sellers also criticized the \\"busy\\" backgrounds and lackluster animations as making the game feel \\"choppy\\". Frank Provo of GameSpot more harshly criticized the graphics, adding a complaint that the graphical updates did not reflect the ten years since the last releases to the criticisms of the backgrounds and animations. He gave similar criticisms of the music and sound effects' lack of upgrade from the quality of the ten-year-old original games. The gameplay similarly received mixed opinions; John \\"Gestalt\\" Bye of Eurogamer praised the difficult, \\"old school\\" gameplay as a successful adaptation of the originals, though with minor dislikes of the boss battles and shortness of gameplay, while Sellers of IGN noted the \\"aging\\" gameplay that, while sound, did not compare as well to more recent games. Pocket Games claimed that the gameplay was both faithful to the original games while also being \\"boring and repetitive\\". GameSpot's Provo termed the difficult gameplay an \\"acquired taste\\", and one which was better suited to a system where players could save anywhere, while AllGame's White criticized the size of the levels, which he felt were ill-suited to the small screen of the Game Boy Color and which led to tedious hunting for where to go next. White, Provo, and Eurogamer all concluded that the game was best suited for fans of the original series or younger players.

History Kenzo Kase, a Japanese-American chiropractor, developed the product from the 1970s. The company founded by him markets variants under the brand name \\"Kinesio\\" and takes legal action to prevent the word being used as a genericised trademark. A surge in popularity resulted after the product was donated to Olympic athletes in the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics and 2012 London Summer Olympics. The tapes' prominence and mass introduction to the general public have been attributed to Kerri Walsh who wore the tape on her shoulder, and who along with Misty May-Treanor dominated the 2008 beach volleyball event. In 2012, science journalist Brian Dunning speculated on why he had not seen \\"a single athlete, pro beach volleyball players included, wear Kinesio Tape outside of the Olympics\\". He believes that \\"sponsorship dollars may be entirely responsible for the popularity of Kinesio Tape during televised events.\\" Properties The product is a type of thin, elastic cotton tape that can stretch up to 140% of its original length. As a result, if the tape is applied stretched greater than its normal length, it will \\"recoil\\" after being applied and therefore create a pulling force on the skin. This elastic property allows much greater range of motion compared to traditional white athletic tape and can also be left on for long periods of time before reapplication. Designed to mimic human skin, with roughly the same thickness and elastic properties, the tape can be stretched 30‚Äì40% in the longitudinal direction. It is a latex-free material with acrylic adhesive, which is heat activated. The cotton fibers allow for evaporation and quicker drying leading to longer wear time, up to 4 days. How the tape is claimed to affect the body is dependent on the location on the body, and how it is applied; the stretch direction, the shape, and the location all supposedly play a role in the tape's hypothetical function. Effectiveness There are several theoretical benefits claimed for the tape. One of those is correcting the alignment of weak muscles as well as facilitating joint motion as a result of the tape's recoiling qualities. Additionally, the tape is claimed to lift the skin, increasing the space below it, and increasing blood flow and circulation of lymphatic fluids (swelling). This increase in the interstitial space is said to lead to less pressure on the body's nociceptors, which detect pain, and to stimulate mechanoreceptors, to improve overall joint proprioception. In the article, Kinesio Tape for Athletes: A Big Help, or Hype?, Web MD reports that \\"There has not been conclusive scientific or medical evidence to confirm the effectiveness of the tape.\\"} In the 2012 report, Olympics - Scientists sceptical as athletes get all taped up, Reuters reported that \\"In a review of all the scientific research so far, published in the Sports Medicine journal in February, researchers found 'little quality evidence to support the use of Kinesio tape over other types of elastic taping in the management or prevention of sports injuries\\". Some researchers claim that what athletes are experiencing is just a placebo effect. In July 2012, Steven Novella writing in Science-Based Medicine in the article Olympic Pseudoscience, examined the use of KT in the larger context of \\"sports-related pseudoscience\\". Novella says \\"The world of sports competition is rife with pseudoscience, false claims, dubious products, superstitions, and magical charms.\\" Novella concluded that \\"Consumers should be very skeptical of claims made for products marketed as athletic performance enhancing.\\" In August 2012, science journalist Brian Dunning reports in Kinesio Tape: The Evidence that positive studies of the tape are the result of people being deceived by a \\"stage magician's trick\\" (which he describes in detail) that is used to fool subjects into thinking strength or flexibility is being affected, when they are not. He reports that KT is claimed to be good for a plethora of issues including \\"pain management, injury treatment, injury prevention, enhanced performance, increased range of motion, and just about anything else an athlete might want.\\" He concludes: \\"It sounds like a miracle ‚Äî one simple product that does everything you can imagine. In short, a textbook snake oil product.\\" A 2012 journal article from the Journal of Hand Therapy reported on a double blind study, where elastic therapeutic tape may be of some assistance to clinicians in improving pain-free active range of motion immediately after tape application for patients with shoulder pain. Utilization of the tape for decreasing pain intensity or disability for young patients with suspected shoulder tendonitis/impingement is not supported. After this short period there was no difference in improvement versus using sham tape. Based on two different studies, kinesio tape showed quicker drainage than manually and better patient compliance. A 2012 meta analysis found that the efficacy of elastic therapeutic tape in pain relief was trivial, because no reviewed study found clinically important results. The tape \\"may have a small beneficial role in improving strength, range of motion in certain injured cohorts, and force sense error compared with other elastic tapes, but further studies are needed to confirm these findings\\". The same article concluded: \\"KT had some substantial effects on muscle activity, but it was unclear whether these changes were beneficial or harmful. In conclusion, there was little quality evidence to support the use of KT over other types of elastic taping in the management or prevention of sports injuries\\" A 2013 journal article examined the use of Kinesio Tape and Stretching on shoulder joint range of motion (ROM). Participants with no history of shoulder injuries were assigned to three treatment groups. One using Kinesio Tape only, one stretching only, and one using both Kinesio Tape and stretching. It was found that the usage of Kinesio Tape can increase shoulder ROM, and that stretching had no effect on shoulder ROM if being used alone or when coupled with the Kinesio Tape. A 2014 meta analysis looked at methodological quality of studies, along with overall population effect, and suggested that studies of lower methodological quality are more likely to report beneficial effects of elastic therapeutic taping, thus indicating the perceived effect of using KT is not real. It also suggested that applying elastic therapeutic tape, \\"to facilitate muscular contraction has no, or only negligible, effects on muscle strength\\". A 2015 meta analysis found that the taping provided more pain relief than no treatment at all, but was not better than other treatment approaches in patients with chronic musculoskeletal pain. The same meta analysis did not find any significant changes in disability as a result of taping. A 2016 journal article in the Journal of Exercise Therapy and Rehabilitation conducted a study to test if the colors of Kinesio Tape had any effect on patient perception in patients with tight trapezius muscles. The study had fifty female subjects with tight trapezius muscle. Five different colored tapes were used, red, blue, black, white, and beige. It was found that the color of the tape might affect the feelings of the participants, but no difference to the trapezius muscle was noted. In June 2016, an article published by The Physician and Sportsmedicine found that treatment for Pes anserinus bursitis using Kinesio Tape significantly decreased pain and swelling when compared to Naproxen (an anti inflammatory medicine) + Physical Therapy. Both forms of treatment were effective but the Kinesio Taping was far more effective on reduction of pain, based on a visual analog scale (VAS) and swelling based on the swelling scores. Swelling score was determined by the use of soft tissue sonography. In March 2018, Science-Based Medicine again examined KT in response to its public use at the 2018 Winter Olympics in the article A Miscellany of Medical Malarkey Episode 3: The Revengening. The article reports that: In November 2018, Science-Based Medicine describes a new study published the same month in the online journal BMC Sports Science, Medicine and Rehabilitation which examines the effectiveness of different colors of kinesiology tape, as well as reexamining general effectiveness of kinesiology tape against a placebo.

It was emplaced during a period of kimberlite volcanism in the Late Cretaceous epoch. Although they were originally described as kimberlite or kimberlitic, the Mountain Lake (ML) rocks were later reclassified as alkaline ultramafic volcanics, hybrid alkaline ultramafic rocks, basanite or alkali olivine basalt. Due to extensive clay alteration that obliterated much of their original mineralogy, the question of their proper classification remains unsettled.Skupinski, A. and Langenberg, C.W. 2002. Petrography of the Mountain Lake pipe, Grande Prairie area, Alberta, Canada. Alberta Geological Survey, Special Report 15, 39 p. Location and Geological Setting The ML pipes form part of the Northern Alberta kimberlite province, along with the nearby Birch Mountains kimberlite field and the Buffalo Head Hills kimberlite field. They were discovered in 1989-90 just north of Mountain Lake, which lies about northeast of Grande Prairie, Alberta.

Roger Clement Volume, Elsevier Science, 2004, p. 437 - 440 (accessed via Google books) The ML pipes are hosted within the nonmarine sedimentary rocks of the Wapiti Formation and were erupted onto an inland alluvial plain. The uppermost strata of the Wapiti have been removed by erosion in the area, and most of the bedrock is covered by glacial and post-glacial sediments of Quaternary age. The ML volcaniclastic rocks are more resistant to erosion than the surrounding Wapiti Formation rocks, so the ML cluster forms a small hill.Leckie, D.A., Kjarsgaard, B. et al. 1997.

Fission track dating of apatite gives ages of 72 to 78 Ma. Magnetostratigraphic polarity determinations, coupled with the palynostratigraphic results and radiometric dates, indicate that the ML rocks are not older than 79.1 Ma.Kravchinsky, V.A., Eccles, D.R., Zhang, R. and Cannon, M. 2009.

Lithology and Mineralogy The ML cluster consists of volcaniclastic rocks that are interpreted as representing volcanic crater or diatreme deposits. They include euhedral to broken and pellet-shaped grains of olivine that are supported in a fine-grained groundmass, along with xenoliths derived from sedimentary rocks, crystalline Precambrian rocks, and a variety of types of volcanic rocks. In many examples both the olivine and the groundmass have been totally altered to smectite clay, and in some specimens the clay has been further altered to zeolite minerals and quartz. Although they include diamond indicator mineralsAlberta Geological Survey: Kimberlite, Indicator Minerals and Diamonds such as chromite and several types of garnet (G5, G9, G11 and spessartine), the ML rocks are not considered to have a high potential for diamonds.

It is an International Baccalaureate World School located in the northwestern neighborhoods of Sacramento. History Inderkum High School opened in 2004 with Ron Zimbalist as the principal and Darrin Slojkowski as the assistant principal. A few teachers from the first year remain. Its name comes from Frank Inderkum, a dairy farmer who owned the land the school is on. The mascot is a Tiger. School colors are blue and gold. When it was first opened, many students switched from their (now) rival school, Natomas High School, into Inderkum. As the first years went by, Inderkum‚Äôs non-charter feeder middle schools are Natomas Middle (partner MYP school) and Heron K‚Äì8. Students from Westlake Charter, Natomas Charter, Leroy Greene Academy, and Natomas Pacific Pathways Prep also feed into Inderkum. A new non-charter school, Paso Verde K-8 will send its first group of students to Inderkum for the 2021‚Äì22 school year. The first principal of Inderkum High School was Ron Zimbalist, former Natomas Middle School principal who was principal from 2004 to 2005. From 2005‚Äì2007, Ben Flores was the principal. From 2007-2010 the principal was Leslie Sargent. From 2010‚Äì2013, George Tapanes, former principal at Fortuna Union High School served as principal. From 2013‚Äì2015, Heather Garcia was the assistant superintendent in charge of Inderkum. Since 2015, Dan Motherspaw, who has been at the school since 2005 has served as principal. Academics Inderkum houses the culminating International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme (DP) since 2012. The first class graduated in 2016. It is one of several high schools in the Sacramento area to offer this rigorous academic program. Students can either complete the full diploma by taking a certain battery of classes or pick and choose certain classes to take. The Middle Years Programme (MYP) is something that all freshman and sophomores participate in at Inderkum in addition to participating in their middle school years at Natomas Middle School. Students who attend H. Allen Hight and Paso Verde will also participate in the primary years program during their elementary years. Natomas has the first TK‚Äì12 IB continuum in the entire Sacramento area. The California Early College Academy started in the 2013/2014 school year. It is an opportunity for Inderkum students to take classes in 9th grade and 10th grade that prepare them to take classes at American River College in certain academic subjects during 11th and 12th grade. During the first five years, cohort sizes were 70 students per year. Beginning with the 2018‚Äì19 school year, cohort sizes are now 140 students. Campus In the July 30, 2013 issue of Best Education Degrees, there was an article entitled \\"The 30 Most Amazing High School Campuses In The World.‚Äù Inderkum was placed #1 because of its buildings being highly energy efficient and uses electricity- generating photovoltaic panels, a geothermal ground loop system, low-velocity cooling displacement and radiant slab heating. In 2008, the football stadium and track, officially known as Dave Tooker Stadium opened. Mr. Tooker was the superintendent of Natomas Unified when Inderkum opened. It is colloquially referred to the Home of the Tigers. During the summer of 2019, the stadium received a new all-weather field and an all new weather track. On January 9, 2010, the 23,000 square feet library right next to campus. It is a joint partnership between the Natomas Unified School District, the Los Rios Community College District, and the Sacramento County Public Library system. It is available for use during open library hours plus reserved at times with the school librarian. The roof of the library is shaped like an open book. Athletics During the second semester of 2008, Inderkum began the construction of a new $2.4 million turf football field and all-weather track for multiple uses, such as football, track, cross country, etc. The construction has since been completed, and is for private use. Inderkum participates in the Capital Valley Conference (Division 2) of the Sac Joaquin section. The sports at Inderkum include: Basketball, Football(Most D1 signings in section since school opening in 2005), Cheerleading, Golf, Tennis, Track and field, Volleyball, Baseball, Cross Country, Soccer, Swimming, Wrestling, Water Polo and Softball. Many athletes have been signed from Inderkum into athletic scholarships. Since 2007, Inderkum has been the undefeated league champions in football every year except for 2012. They were the league champions in 2012, simply not undefeated in league. In 2006, Inderkum made the football playoffs for the first time and lost to Del Campo in the Semifinal round. Every year since then, they have made it into at least the 2nd round of the playoffs and have been in the third round or later of the playoffs every season since 2012. Furthermore, they have made it to the section championships 4 times and lost by 6 or fewer points each time to Casa Roble High School in overtime (2008), Del Campo High School (2009), and Oakdale High School (2014). They lost to defending state champions Del Oro High School in the 2016 section championship and lost to Del Oro again in 2017 at the quarter final level.

His observations and insights concerning \\"a special form of human hate\\" and related social and psychological phenomenon furnished a descriptive basis for his philosophical concept of \\"Ressentiment\\". As a widely recognized convention, the French spelling of this term has been retained in philosophical circles so as to preserve a broad sense of discursive meaning and application. Scheler died unexpectedly of a heart attack in 1928 leaving a vast body of unfinished works. Extrapolations from his thoughts have always since piqued interest and discussion on a variety of topics. His works were on the Nazi book burn list. As a concept belonging to the study of ethics, Ressentiment represents the antithetical process of Scheler's emotively informed non-formal ethics of values. But Ressentiment can also be said to be, at once, Scheler's darkest as well as his most psychological and sociological of topics, foreshadowing many later findings in those particular social sciences. Folk wisdom comes closest to Scheler's meaning by recognizing Ressentiment as a self-defeating turn of mind which is non-productive and ultimately a waste of time and energy. Maturity informs most of us that sustained hatred hurts the hater far more than the object of our hate. Sustained hatred enslaves by preventing emotional growth from progressing beyond the sense of pain having been precipitated, in some way, by whom or what is hated (i.e., another person, group or class of persons). Background It is difficult to imagine the intellectual concern of late 19th and early 20th Century over the collective drift in Western Civilization away from old-guard monarchial and hierarchical societal structures (i.e., one's station in life being determined primarily by birth), toward the relative uncertainty and instability embodied in such Enlightenment Era ideals such as democracy, nationhood, class struggle (Karl Marx), human equality, humanism, egalitarianism, utilitarianism and the like. As such, Ressentiment, as a phenomenon, was first viewed as a pseudo-ethically based political force enabling the lower classes of society to rise in their situation in life at the (perceived) expense of the higher, or more inherently \\"noble\\" classes. Hence, Ressentiment first emerged as, what some might view, a reactionary and elitist concept by today's democratic standards; while others of a more conservative mind-set might view Ressentiment as liberalism disguised as a socialist attempt at usurping the role of individual responsibility and self- determination. In any event Scheler's contributions regarding this topic can not be fully appreciated without some cursory reference to the thought of Friedrich Nietzsche (1844‚Äì1900). Friedrich Nietzsche used the Kierkegaardian term Ressentiment as the source of this emerging degenerative morality issuing from an underlying existential distinction between what he saw as the two basic character options available to the individual: the Strong (\\"Over Man,\\" \\"Superman\\" or \\"Master\\") or the Weak (the \\"Slave\\"). The Master-type fully accepts the burdens of freedom and decides a path of self-determination. The Slave, rather than deciding to be the authentic author of his own destiny, chooses a repressed unsatisfying mode of life, blaming (by projection) his submissiveness, loss of self-esteem and pitiful lot in life upon the dominant Master figure (and his entire social class) who by contrast seems to flourish at every moment. A true enough assessment, given that economic exploitation always seems to lie at the heart of any intrinsic Master / Slave social arrangement, along with the Master class \\"washing their hands\\" (so to speak) of the burdens of social responsibility. This underlying Ressentiment forms the underlying rationale for a code of conduct (e.g., passive acceptance of abuse, fear of reprisal for asserting personal rights due to implied intimidation, or inability to enjoy life) belonging to the Slave-type or class (\\"Slave Morality\\"). Nietzsche was an atheist and harbored a particular disdain for Christianity, which he viewed as playing a key role in supporting Slave Morality. In supporting the Weak and disadvantaged of humanity, Christianity undermined the authority, social position and cultural progress of the Strong. Nietzsche viewed the progress of such Slave Morality as a sort of violation of the natural order and a thwarting of the authentic advancements of civilization available only through the Strong. This view of a \\"natural order\\", so typical of 19th Century Europe (e.g., Darwin's Theory of Evolution) is expressed in Nietzsche's metaphysical principal ‚Äì Will to Power. Scheler, by comparison, ultimately viewed the universal salvic nature of Christian love as contradicting Nietzsche's assessments, and in later life developed an alternate metaphysical dualism of Vital Urge and Spirit: Vital Urge as closely allied to Will to Power, and Spirit as dependent yet truly distinct in character. Contrary to Nietzsche's ultimate intent, much of his legacy ultimately led to an implosion of objectivity in which (i) truth became relative to individual perspective, (ii) \\"might ultimately made right\\" (\\"Social Darwinism\\"), and (iii) ethics would become subjective and solipsistic. By contrast, Scheler, who also was skeptical over the historically emerging unchecked power of mass culture and the prevalence and leveling power of mediocrity upon ethical standards and upon the individual human person (as a unique sacred value), was nonetheless a theistic ethical objectivist.. For Scheler, the phenomenon of Ressentiment principally involved Spirit (as opposed to Will to Power, Drives or Vital Urge), which entailed deeper personal issues involving distortion of the objective realm of values, the self-poisoning of moral character, and personality disorder. Basic features of Ressentiment Scheler's described Ressentiment in his 1913 book by the same title as follows: > \\"‚Ä¶Ressentiment is a self-poisoning of the mind which has quite definite > causes and consequences. It is a lasting mental attitude, caused by the > systematic repression of certain emotions and affects which, as such are > normal components of human nature. Their repression leads to the constant > tendency to indulge in certain kinds of value delusions and corresponding > value judgments. The emotions and affects primarily concerned are revenge, > hatred, malice, envy, the impulse to detract, and spite.\\" Although scholars do not agree on a fixed number or attributes materially defining Ressentiment, they have nonetheless collectively articulated about ten authoritative and insightful points (many times combining them) which stake-out the boundaries of this concept: 1) Ressentiment must first and foremost be understood in relation to, what Scheler termed the apriori hierarchy of value modalities. While the direction of personal transcendence and ethical action is one toward positive and higher values, the direction of Ressentiment and unethical action is one toward negative and lower values. Scheler viewed values as emotively experienced with reference to a universal, objective, constant and unchanging apriori hierarchy of value modalities. From lowest to highest these modalities (with their respective positive and corresponding negative dis-value forms) are as follows: sensual values of the agreeable and the disagreeable; vital values of the noble and vulgar; mental (psychic) values of the beautiful and ugly, right and wrong and truth and falsehood; and finally values of the Holy and Unholy of the Divine and Idols. Ressentiment represents the dark underside, or inversion, of Scheler's vision of a personal and transformational non-formal ethics of values. File:Ethical directions within an a priori hierarchy of value modalities.jpg File:Ressentiment directions within an a priori hierarchy of value modalities.jpg 2) Ressentiment, as a personal disposition, has its genesis in negative psychic feelings and feeling states which most people experience as normal reactive responses to the demands of social life: i.e., envy, jealousy, anger, hatred, spite, malice, joy over another's misfortune, mean spirited competition, etc. The objective sources of such feeling states responses might be occasioned by almost anything: e.g., personal criticism, ridicule, mockery, rejection, abandonment, etc. For the individual person, the ethical and psychological issue becomes how the energy from these feeling states will be channeled so as to better benefit the individual person and society. 3) Ressentiment is highly situational in character in that it always involves \\"mental comparisons\\" (value-judgments) with other people who allegedly have no such Ressentiment feelings, and who likewise exhibit genuinely positive values. Hence, although Ressentiment might begin with something like admiration and respect, but surely ends in a sort of coveting of those personal qualities and goods of another: i.e., advantages afforded by their beauty, intelligence, charm, wit, personality, education, talent, skills, possessions, wealth, work achievement, family affiliation and the like. This early stage of Ressentiment resembles what we might refer to today as an inferiority complex. However, one can easily extend this notion of \\"comparing\\" to externally acquired qualifiers having the potential for negative valuations which also tend to a support consumer based economics: i.e., status symbol possessions (a lavish house, or car), expensive fashion accessories, special privileges, club memberships, plastic surgery and the like. This principal is expressed in our common colloquialism of \\"Keeping-up with the Jones'\\". The subliminal result of all of these \\"comparisons\\" tend to lend credence the idea that one's self-concept, self-image, self-esteem, worth or social desirability is linked to our social inclusion or exclusion in a favored superior class having the means to insulate themselves from the rest of society. 4) Ressentiment, as situational, also typically extends to inherent social roles. Many social roles involve relationships frequently occasioning some level of inter-personal value-judgment with accompanying negative psychic feelings and feeling states which suggest dominant and submissive roles, not unlike Nietzsche's Master-Slave dichotomy. For example: *The subordinate and/or submissive gender roles assigned to woman in terms of sexuality, child rearing and nurturing tasks. *Generational Divides (\\"Generation Gaps\\"): The rejection of a younger generation by members of an older generation, due to the latter's inability to accept their own changes and to move beyond the value pursuits proper to those preceding stages of life. Also, the reverse is true. The rejection of an older generation by members of a younger generation due to latter's inability to accept the fact that the older generation understands and sympathizes with the challenges they face. *Progressive forms of inter- family and blended-family relations: i.e., younger siblings toward the elder sense of entitlement; the hyper-critical mother-in-law toward the daughter-in- law;, or even the more contemporarily abandonment of an ex-spouse in favor of \\"trophy wife\\" or \\"trophy husband\\" as a status symbol signaling a raise in social status; the relational neglect toward children from a previous marriage over ones of the current; the reactions of peer friends and family to a romantic relationship involving partners of vastly different ages; the pathetic efforts of a mediocre ne‚Äôer-do-well child to live up to the standards of a successful high achieving parent, etc. *The classic employee / employer adversarial relationships. 5) Ressentiment triggers a tendency in people which Scheler termed \\"Man's Inherent Fundamental Moral Weakness\\": a sense of hopelessness which pre-disposes a person to regress and seek surrogates of lower value as a source of solace. When personal progress becomes stagnant or frustrated in moving from a negative to a more positive plateau given a relatively high vital or psychic level of value attainment, there is an inherent tendency toward regression in terms of indulgence in traditional vices and a host of other physical and psychological addictions and self- destructive modes of behavior (e.g., the use of narcotics). This tendency to seek surrogates to compensate for a frustration with higher value attainment inserts itself into the scenario of consumerist materialism as an insatiable self-defeating need \\"to have more\\" in order to fill the void of our own philosophical bankruptcy and spiritual poverty.  Essential structures of Ressentiment proper: \\"Pathological Ressentiment\\"  Further refining Ressentiment, Scheler wrote: > \\"Through its very origin, ressentiment is therefore chiefly confined to > those who serve and are dominated at the moment, who fruitlessly resent the > sting of authority. When it occurs elsewhere, it is either due to > psychological contagion‚Äîand the spiritual venom of ressentiment is extremely > contagious ‚Äì or to the violent suppression of an impulse which subsequently > revolts by \\"embittering\\" and \\"poisoning\\" the personality.\\" Hence, certain advanced characteristics of Ressentiment link this phenomenon to what we might refer to today as personality disorders. As such, Ressentiment Proper (\\"Pathological Ressentiment‚Äô) is not materially linked exclusively to issues of socio-economic status, but rather cuts across all socio-economic strata of society to include even the most powerful. 6) In Pathological Ressentiment a Sense of Impotency develops on the part of those experiencing ressentiment-feelings, especially if situational and social factors weigh so heavily so as render a person unable to release or resolve negative psychic feelings and feeling states in a positive and constructive manner: what we refer to today in psychological terms as repression. Originally understood, Ressentiment is defused whenever one has the power and ability to physically retaliate, or act out, against an oppressor. For example, an ancient Roman citizen, as Master, could be expected to take revenge straight away upon his Slave while the reverse would be unthinkable. \\"When [negative psychic feelings and feeling states] can be acted out, no ressentiment results. But when a person is unable to release these feelings against the persons or groups evoking them, thus developing a sense of impotence, and when these feelings are continuously re-experienced over time, then ressentiment arises.\\" But for Scheler, the essence of Impotency as characteristic of Pathological Ressentiment has less to do with the actual presence of an external oppressor, and more to do with a self-inflicted personal sense of inadequacy over limitations in the face of positive value attainment itself. Hence, Resesentiment-feelings tend to be continuously re- experienced over time in a self-perpetuating manner primarily fueled by a sense of inadequacy felt within the self which the \\"other\\" really only occasions. For example, one can have every advantage in life given them, yet prove to lack the talent for achieving the goals set for him or her self. These re-experienced feelings of impotency become rationalized on a subconscious level as knee-jerk attitudinal projections: i.e., prejudices, bias, racism, bigotry, cynicism, and closed mindedness. Noteworthy is the \\"abstract\\" focus of Ressentiment: the fact that specific individuals (i.e., the \\"Master figure\\" or their counterpart \\"Slave figure\\") are no longer even required for Ressentiment feelings and their rationalized forms of expression to continue and drive forward. One only needs a representative member of the class of one's focus of resentment to be represented in some way. \\"Members of a group can become random targets of hate, borne out of impotence that seeks to level the group.\\" Such a random formal treatment of \\"otherness\\" offers a plausible explanation for hate crimes, serial killings (in part), genocide, the general framing of an enemy in faceless non-human terms, as well as any top-down or bottom-up form of class warfare agenda, etc. Hence, there must be a psychic distancing of de-personalization between Master and Slave perceptions of \\"the other\\" in order for Ressentiment to operate effectively. 7) Pathological Ressentiment entails \\"Value-Delusion\\". Value Delusion is \\"a tendency to belittle, degrade, dismiss or to ‚Äòreduce‚Äô genuine values as well as their bearers.\\" However, this is done in a distinctively non-productive manner because \\"ressentiment does not lead to affirmation of counter-values since ressentiment-imbued persons secretly crave the values they publicly denounce.\\" This aspect of Value Delusions represents a horizontal shift of value judgment concerning things and the world from a positive to a more negative orientation. What was once loved or thought of as good becomes devalued as \\"sour grapes\\" . or \\"damaged goods\\" in the mind of the Ressentiment-imbued person, and what was previously lacking in value is now elevated to the status of acceptable. In spite of this decidedly negative direction, \\"the ressentiment-subject is continuously 'plagued' by those distractions of unattainable values in that he emotionally replaces them with disvalues issuing forth from his impotence. In the background of such an illusory and self-deceiving over-turning of positive values with illusory negative valuations there still remains transparency of the true objective order of values and their ranks.\\" Hence, the demands of Value-Delusion manifest in what we commonly refer to as a superiority complex, i.e., arrogance, hubris, hypocrisy, employment of double standards, denial, revenge, and self-projection of one's own negative qualities onto the opposition. Correspondingly, negative feeling states suggest the absence, repudiation or flight from positive values. But nonetheless, negative values do not stand on their own intrinsic merit: they always refer back in some way to correspondingly positive values. Emotionally, Value Delusion turns happiness to sadness, compassion to hate, hope to despair, self-respect to shame, love and acceptance to rejection (or worse, competition), resolve to dread, and so on down throughout the human emotional strata. Delusion is essential for the Ressentiment-imbued person in order to maintain any semblance of mental homeostasis. 8) Pathological Ressentiment ultimately manifests as \\"Metaphysical Confusion\\". Metaphysical Confusion is a form of Value Delusion in which the value shift is more vertical in character, in relation to the apriori hierarchy of value modalities. In this dimension, Value Delusion occurs a sort of twisting, or false inversion, of the value hierarchy wherein higher value-contents and bearers are viewed as lower, and lower as higher. Today we commonly refer to this phenomenon as \\"Having One's Priorities Out of Order.\\" Scheler illustrated such an inversion in his analysis of Western civilizations humanistic, materialistic and capitalistic propensities to elevate utility values above those of vital values.. Carried to the logical extreme, \\"Ressentiment brings its most important achievement when it determines a whole \\"morality,\\" preventing the rules of preference until what was \\"evil\\" appears \\"good\\". File:Ethical directions within an a priori hierarchy of value modalities.jpgClick on to enlarge Image:Slide_3.JPGClick on to enlarge 9) Pathological Ressentiment ultimately results in a deadening (psychological numbing) of normal sympathetic feeling states, as well as all higher forms of psychic and spiritual feelings and feeling states. As opposed to a pure well ordered emotive life (Ordo Amoris) appropriate to the ethical person as created in God's image through love (ens amans), Pathological Ressentiment emotively results in a disordered heart (de‚Äôordre du coeurs), or what we might commonly refer to as a \\"hardened heart.\\" For Scheler, morality finds expression in response to \\"the call of the hour\\", or exercise of personal conscience, which is based the heart's proper order of love (Ordo Amoris) in relation to positive and higher values. By contrast, Ressentiment with its corresponding Value-Delusions willfully favors varying degrees of a disordered heart (de‚Äôordre du coeurs) and twisted emotions consistent with personality disorders. For example, it is precisely the failure to feel for and identify with their victims (even to the extent of deriving sadistic pleasure) which characterizes the sociopath, the psychopath, the serial killer, the dictator, the rapist, the bully, the corrupt CEO and the ruthless drug dealer‚Äîall share this same common denominator. Common Law would refer to this quality as \\"cold blooded\\". Author Erick Larson in his book Devil in the White City renders with great precision a literary description of this deadening of higher feeling states in reference to America's first serial killer, Herman Webster Mudgett, alias Dr. H.H. Holmes > \\"‚Ä¶Holmes was charming and gracious, but something about him made Belkamp > [the antagonist] uneasy. He could not have defined it. Indeed for the next > several decades alienists [early psychologists] and their successors would > find themselves hard-pressed with any precision what it was about men like > Holmes that caused them to seem warm and integrating but also telegraph the > vague sense that some important element of humanness was missing. At first > alienists described this condition as \\"moral insanity\\" and those who > exhibited the disorder as \\"moral imbeciles.\\" They later adopted the term > \\"psychopath\\"‚Ä¶as a \\"new malady\\" and stated, \\"Besides his own person and his > own interests, nothing is sacred to the psychopath.\\" The Ressentiment-Imbued person exercises such a pronounced psychic distance from his victims so as to never fully achieve the desired lasting satisfaction produced though his own unethical actions. \\"Retaliation\\" of this sort no longer yields any good, and \\"expression\\" of this sort lacks all possibility of positive results. \\"In true ressentiment there is no emotive satisfaction but only a life-long anger and anguish in feelings that are compared with others.\\" Unfortunately in general, our particular era suffers from a pronounced inability to feel higher levels of vital psychic (intellectual and sympathetic) and spiritual feeling states. For example, the process of our legal system tends to convert the absolute character of moral sentiments to a \\"blameless\\" game of negotiation of cost vs. benefits. Can we even imagine the moral education furnished by such archaic practices as the stockade or tar and feathering so as to invoke real public humiliation for crimes? In addition, we as a culture have become so desensitized to feelings of outrage over public persons of power and stature lacking in all feelings of shame over their wrongdoings that our greatest moral problem becomes one of complacency. Ressentiment and wider societal impact 10) Finally, Pathological Ressentiment bears a particular relation to the Socio-Political Realm by virtue of, what Scheler describes as, man's lowest form of social togetherness, \\"Psychic Contagion\\". Psychic Contagion is the phenomenon of uncritically \\"following the crowd\\", or mob mentality, liken to lemmings charging over a cliff. Positive examples, are good natured crowds in a pub or at sporting events; a negative example, violent rioting. As a concept, Psychic Contagion bears an affinity to Nietzsche's assessment of Slave-type mentality. To the extent that the politically powerful (i.e., the \\"Master\\" faction or \\"Slave\\" faction of society, as the case might be) are able to rally collective cultural animosities through the use of Psychic Contagion, they increase their ability to achieve their underlying socio-political objectives. Such methods usually take the forms of incendiary rhetoric, scapegoat tactics (e.g., anti- Semitism, homophobia, hatred toward welfare recipients and the disadvantaged, etc.), class warfare, partisan politics, propaganda, excessive secrecy / non- transparency, closed minded political ideology, jingoism, misguided nationalism, violence, and waging unjust war. The use of such methods of negative Psychic Contagion can be viewed as having propelled such historical figures or movements as Nero (burning of Rome), the French Revolution (Ressentiment in the original concept), Hitler (genocide of the Jews, the Aryan Master Race agenda and the Lebensborn project), the 1975-1979 Cambodian Khmer Rouge (genocidal social engineering), the 1994 Rwanda (tribal based genocide), International Fundamental Islamic Terrorism.  Conclusions  It is a mistake to assess Scheler's concept of Ressentiment as chiefly a theory of psychological pathology, though surely it is that in part. In addition, Ressentiment is a philosophical and ethical concept from which to assess the spiritual and cultural health both of individual persons and society as a whole: a task which seems all the more urgent given economic globalization (i.e., a tendency toward carte blanche predatory capitalism). For example, it is entirely acceptable to view human ethical transcendence as complementary and commensurate with a bottom-up psychology of needs and drives so long as the arch of that qualitative direction is positive in nature. However the reverse is false. Negative parallel aspects are irreducible to Scheler's top- down metaphysical principal of good as emanating from our personal development as spiritual beings. This distinction is illustrated by the many cases in which negative role models can, and do, emerge as highly self-actualized economically powerful individuals from a psychological standpoint (clearly \\"Superman\\" type persons), but who are entirely lacking from an ethical, social and spiritual standpoint: e.g., the drug king-pin or pimp as a person young boys admire and look up to, or the corrupt CEO who absconds with obscene bonuses while his company goes bankrupt and the employee pension fund disintegrates. These negative manifestations of values and value inversions demonstrate how the philosophical conception of Ressentiment rests upon qualitatively different grounds transcending science and pure economics. For Scheler, Ressentiment is essentially a matter of self in relation to values, and only proximately an issue of social conflict over resources, power and the like (Master / Slave, or dominant / submissive relationships). For Scheler, what we call \\"having class\\", for instance, is not something as one-dimensional as power, money, or goods and services readily sold or purchased. Rather, liken to the array of apriori hierarchy of value modalities, \\"class\\" has to do with who you make of yourself as a person, which involves a whole range of factors including moral character, integrity, talents, aptitudes, achievements, education, virtues (i.e., generosity), reciprocal respect among diverse individuals (active citizenship) and the like. Since society must be guided by the rule of law above power, we must promote government which relies upon fairness (See John Rawls) and egalitarian principal in terms of channeling our national economic forces. Self-interest (as in Adam Smith's \\"invisible hand\\") is man's (and nature's) most highly efficient means of positively converting Vital Urge into human economic benefits-‚Äîthe point at which \\"the rubber hits the road\\"‚Äîbut it is also a force highly susceptible to greed. Therefore, government must insure that such raw pursuit of utility value is not purely an end in itself, but must serve primarily to form an economic base upon which genuine value strata and culture can take root and flourish for the common good as well as everyone's respective individual needs. We should realize that living with less materially does not diminish in any way our access to greater emotional, intellectual, artistic and spiritual fulfillment. Only in such ways can virtue truly become its own reward.

More specifically, it is a potassium- rich variety of basaltic trachyandesite, composed of olivine, augite and plagioclase phenocrysts in a groundmass with calcic plagioclase and sanidine and some dark-colored volcanic glass. Shoshonite gives its name to the shoshonite series and grades into absarokite with the loss of plagioclase phenocrysts and into banakite with an increase in sanidine.Gest, D. E. and A. R. McBirney, Genetic relations of shoshonitic and absarokitic magmas, Absaroka Mountains, Wyoming, Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research, Vol 6; issues 1-2, Sept 1979. pp 85-104 Shoshonite was named by Iddings in 1895 for the Shoshone River in Wyoming.Shoshonite: Webster's Online Dictionary Textural and mineralogical features of potash-rich rocks of the absarokite- shoshonite-banakite series strongly suggest that most of the large crystals and aggregates are not true phenocrysts as previously thought but are xenocrysts and microxenoliths, suggesting a hybrid origin involving assimilation of gabbro by high-temperature syenitic magma.Prostka, Harold J., Hybrid Origin of the Absarokite-Shoshonite-Banakite Series, Absaroka Volcanic Field, Wyoming, 1973 GSA Bulletin February, 1973 v. 84 no. 2 p. 697-702 abstract Chemical characteristics Igneous rocks with shoshonitic chemical characteristics must be:Morrison, Gregg, 1980, Characteristics and tectonic settings of shoshonite rock association, Lithos, 13, 97-108 #Near-saturated in silica; #Low iron enrichment; #High total alkalies (Na2O + K2O > 5%); #High K2O/Na2O; #Steep positive slope for K2O versus SiO2 at low SiO2; #Enrichment in P, Rb, Sr, Ba, Pb, light rare earth elements; #Low TiO2; #High but variable Al2O3; #High Fe2O3/FeO. Tectonic settings and examples Shoshonitic rocks tend to be associated with calc-alkaline island-arc subduction volcanism, but the K-rich shoshonites are generally younger and above deeper, steeper parts or the Benioff zone. Volcanic rocks of the absarokite-shoshonite-banakite series described from Yellowstone Park by Iddings and the similar ciminite- toscanite series described from western Italy by Washington are associated with leucite-bearing rocks, potassium-rich trachytes and andesitic rocks. Similar associations are described from several other regions including Indonesia and the East African Rift.Joplin, Germaine A., The shoshonite association: A review, Journal of the Geological Society of Australia, v. 15, #2, 1968, pp 275-294 DOI:10.1080/00167616808728699 In the Aeolian Arc in the southern Tyrrhenian Sea (between the Eurasian and African tectonic plates), volcanism has changed between calc-alkaline to high-K calc-alkaline to shoshonitic with the last one million years, possibly due to the progressive steepening of the Benioff zone, which is inclined at 50-60¬∞. An example of shoshonite lava in this region is the Capo Secco lava shield near Vulcano. Late Cretaceous Puerto Rican volcanism is interpreted to have occurred in a similar tectonic setting. In places, shoshonitic and high-potassium calc- alkaline magmatism is associated with world-class hydrothermal gold and copper-gold mineralization. Examples include:M√ºller D., Groves D.I.

He was born in Dallas, Georgia into a family of racers. His career included racing in the SRE (Southeastern Racing Enterprises) organization as well as the 11 NASCAR Grand National Series and 30 Convertible races. Rakestraw was known for his toughness and thoughtfulness of other drivers due to one incident at Lakewood Speedway in 1957 when he drove through a fence and into the infield lake to avoid T-boning another driver who had crashed in front of him. After he retired from racing, Rakestraw went to work as a mechanic and later became a service manager for a local grading company. Career Wilbur Rakestraw began his career in 1956 racing at his hometown track, the Dallas Speed Bowl. He drove a 1937 Ford Coupe with the number 999 in honor of Henry Ford's first race car, which had been driven by Barney Oldfield. He continued racing in the SRE circuit at various local tracks including Fairburn, Gainesville, Lakewood, Cornelia, Canton, Macon, and the Peach Bowl. Rakestraw had 30 starts at 19 different tracks including the last Beach Race in Daytona Beach, Florida in the NASCAR Grand National Division from 1956‚Äì1961. He placed a top five finish at Columbia, South Carolina and 6 other top ten finishes at various different tracks. He started in three Daytona 500 Speedway races where his best finish was 22nd at the inaugural event in 1959. He raced in several NASCAR Convertible Series events in 1958 and 1959, where he picked 3 top fives and 4 top tens. His best unofficial finish was a second place drive in a non-points race at Daytona behind Junior Johnson and immediately ahead of Fred Lorenzen. Rakestraw was a member of the Midwest Association of Race Cars (MARC) (now ARCA), where he collected numerous wins and top ten finishes. Due to lack of funds, Rakestraw retired from racing after the 1961 season. In a 2008 interview, Rakestraw said \\"I was considered a very good race driver. A lot of my friends hated to see me get out of it. If not for financial problems, I'd have been there until I got too old. I enjoyed it as much as anybody could.\\" In 2008, Rakestraw was inducted into the Georgia Automobile Racing Hall of Fame (GRHOF).

Business interests His directorships included the Union Society in 1759, the South Sea Company in 1763, and the Union Fire Office in 1764. He held them all until he died. Thomas Lucas's West Indies interests were in St Kitts, Leeward Islands and, in partnership with William Coleman, as a London agent for other Leeward Islands planters.

His easy association with the nobility and other ties suggest he could have been, if not illegitimate, heir to the barony of Lucas of Shenfield and so a part of the family of Henry Grey (c1664-1740) Duke of Kent.

He is best known as the builder of the North Bridge, which links the Old and New Towns of Edinburgh, Scotland. He was the younger brother of Robert Mylne, architect and designer of Blackfriars Bridge in London. Early life William was descended from the Mylne family of stonemasons and architects. He was the second son of Thomas Mylne, Deacon of the mason's guild, who built the original Edinburgh Royal Infirmary to designs by William Adam. Like his elder brother Robert, William attended the Royal High School.Ward, p.12 He then served time as an apprentice stonemason.Colvin, pp.685-686 Grand tour In autumn 1753 he left Edinburgh for Paris, where he studied at the √âcole des Arts under the architect Jacques-Fran√ßois Blondel. As well as part-time study, he also undertook paid work, learning the art of marble carving, to supplement the minimal allowance from his father.Ward, p.19 The following year, at the suggestion of James Nevay, a fellow Scot in France, Mylne proposed to his father that he be allowed to go on to Rome to study architecture, with a view to eventually setting up practice in London.Ward, p.20 The result was that his elder brother Robert joined him in Paris, and they travelled to Rome together. Robert had recently completed his apprenticeship, and was preparing to take over the family business. He arrived in France by the end of November 1754, and the brothers set off a few days later. Travelling mostly by foot, due to lack of funds, they visited Avignon and Marseilles, where they took a boat to Civitavecchia, and arrived at Rome in early 1755.Ward, p.21-23 The brothers lodged on the Via del Condotti, although they were continually short of funds.Ward, p.25 They encountered Robert Adam, a fellow Scot also studying architecture, although Adam was disdainful of the Mylnes' poor situation; the Mylnes had a joint allowance of just ¬£45 a year, compared to Adam's annual expenditure of around ¬£800.Ward, p.29 They visited Naples in May 1756, but William was planning to leave by September, on account of his dislike of the hot weather.Ward, p.28 Leaving Robert at Rome the following spring, William travelled north, spending several months visiting Pisa, Florence, and Venice. Here he met Robert Adam again, also travelling home, although the latter did not offer him a lift in his coach.Ward, p.31 William also visited several of Palladio's villas in the area, making measured drawings and sketches.Ward, p.30 His journey home during the winter of 1757-1758 was fraught with difficulty due to the weather, politics, and his own finances. The Seven Years' War had broken out between England and France, and their respective allies, forcing a journey through Germany. Mylne was obliged to burn all his papers to hide his British identity, and posed as an Italian to avoid being either arrested or pressed into military service. He travelled across the Alps by sledge, and through Germany by post coach, as the rivers were frozen and boat travel was impossible. He arrived in Rotterdam in February, suffering from cold and hunger. He described the experience, in a letter to Robert, as \\"one continuous ague of fears and fatigues\\".Ward, p.32 Edinburgh Mylne's North Bridge, with Calton Hill in the background, in 1829 William returned to his home city, where he established himself as a mason and architect in the family tradition. By 1758 he was a member of the Incorporation of St Mary's Chapel, the guild of masons and carpenters in Edinburgh, and began to take on the running of his father's business. He lived at the family home in Halkerston's Wynd, off the Royal Mile, initially with his older sister Elizabeth as housekeeper, until she eloped in 1758,Ward, p.79 and then with his younger sister Anne. He was appointed Surveyor to the city in 1759. In 1759, he designed the Yair Bridge, over the River Tweed at Fairnilee, which he built between 1760 and 1764, and which still stands. Between 1768 and 1772, William and Robert were jointly responsible for designing and supervising construction, of the New Bridge over the River Clyde in Glasgow. This bridge, carrying Jamaica Street, was replaced by a larger structure in 1836. In February 1763 Thomas Mylne died. Robert by this time was an established architect and engineer in London, and had won the competition to build a new bridge at Blackfriars. William therefore took on the family business, while Robert inherited the family's mansion at Powderhall, where their mother continued to live.Ward, p.81 In 1765, Mylne submitted his plans for a new bridge to link Edinburgh's Old Town with the area to the north, which was to become the New Town. The bridge was the subject of a competition, and other designs were prepared by James Craig and David Henderson. Mylne's design was selected, and he was contracted to build the bridge, for ¬£10,140, within four years.Ward, p.94 The North Bridge comprised three stone arches, and was long, and high, although much of the length was solid abutment. Robert Mylne acted as financial surety to the scheme. By the summer of 1769 the bridge was approaching completion, and although not officially open, was regularly used by pedestrians. However, on 3 August, one of the arches collapsed, causing the deaths of five people. Poor foundations, resting on accumulated rubbish at the bottom of the valley, were blamed. Robert came up from London to offer his assistance, and the Town Council commissioned a report on the collapse from John Smeaton and John Adam. William's payments were stopped until the matter was resolved.Ward, p.95 William repaired the damage, and completed the bridge in 1772, but the collapse led him into financial difficulties. America His financial problems aggravated William's poor health and sensitive nature. In May 1773 he fled Edinburgh, arriving in London three months later. Avoiding his brother, he sailed for America, with the aim of establishing himself anew. Once there, he corresponded regularly with his sister in Edinburgh and brother in London. He initially travelled to South Carolina, setting himself up as a planter. In 1774 he moved to New York, and once again tried to make his way as an architect, but was not successful, and Mylne decided to return to Britain. Dublin On his return from America, Robert assisted him in obtaining the job of running the Dublin Water Works. He held this post until his death, improving and enlarging the water supply system. The Lord Mayor presented him with a silver plate in 1786, with an inscription praising his contribution to the city. William Mylne died in March 1790, at the age of 56. Robert Mylne erected a plaque in St. Catherine's Church, Dublin, \\"to inform Posterity of the uncommon Zeal, Integrity and Skill with which he formed, enlarged, and established on a perfect system, the Water Works of Dublin.\\" Family William Mylne never married, although he fathered a son, Willy, around 1770.Ward, p.101 Willy was raised in the Mylne household, and William paid for his education at the Royal High School.

Aside from small grains, these harvesters were able to harvest some flowers, as well as various grasses and legume crops for seed. The first combines under that name, the All-Crop 60, had a 60-inch, sickle-bar cutting head, and the popular Model 66 had a 66-inch cutting head. Many of these units are still in working condition, and they are well known for their dependability and low maintenance; however, as they are quite small machines (and now very old), they are not practical on today's large farms. They were superseded by the Allis-Chalmers Gleaner combine harvesters. All-Crop 40 Specifically designed for the Allis Chalmers Model B and C tractors, this model had a 38-inch cut and could harvest approximately one acre per hour. Produced from 1938 to 1940; only about 15,000 made. All-Crop 60 Five foot (60-inch) cut; replaced flat belt with Texrope V-belt system. Produced from 1935 to 1949, with over 100,000 produced, this was by far the most popular All-Crop model. Harry C. Merritt and Charles J. Scranton each earned the prestigious Cyrus Hall McCormick Medal of the American Society of Agricultural Engineers for their work on the design of this machine. All-Crop 60A Introduced in 1950 as a slightly improved Model 60, this model was only made until 1952, with about 75,000 built. All- Crop 66 Introduced in 1953 as successor to the 60A, this model featured a 6-inch greater cut than its predecessor. It was on this model that Allis- Chalmers introduced their \\"Big-Bin\\" model, which held 25 versus 18 bushels. Produced for six years, 72,839 of this model were built. All-Crop 72 On this model, a new header design was implemented; an auger feed instead of a canvas conveyor. Produced from 1959 to 1969, approximately 75,000 of these were built. All-Crop 90 The largest pull-type All-Crop, this model had a seven and a half foot header and was matched to the Allis-Chalmers D-series tractos. Produced from 1957 to 1960, about 7,540 units of this model produced. All-Crop SP100 Powered by an Allis W-226 engine, the 100 could be equipped with a 9-foot or 12-foot header. Weighing in at 6,760 lbs, 4,500 units of this machine were produced from 1953 to 1957. It was replaced by the Super 100 model in 1958. All-Crop Super SP100 Essentially the same as the All-Crop 100, the Super 100 had a few more luxuries. It was replaced by the Gleaner series when Allis acquired the Gleaner Harvester Corp. Built only in 1958, there were approximately 1,000 of these machines produced.

He was a powerful nobleman in the region around N√°jera and Calahorra and a major figure at the courts of both Navarre and Castile. He was ambushed and killed while trying to take possession of the castle of Rueda de Jal√≥n during the Reconquista. In Navarre Ramiro is first mentioned in a charter of his father's dated 18 April, probably 1052, as an infans, and he continued to appear as infans, during the reign of his brother, Sancho IV. He confirmed a charter on 11 March 1055, and another, a grant of Gomesano, Bishop of Calahorra, on 19 March 1058. On 20 July 1062 Ranimirus infans, Garsea rex prolis (infante Ramiro, child of king Garc√≠a) donated property to the prior of San Mart√≠n de Albelda, which was confirmed by the then lord of Calahorra, Fort√∫n Garc√©s. The will of queen Stephania, dated 1066, bequeathed some property to Ramiro, who is referred to as in Sancto Stephano in a charter of Sancho IV's of 17 April 1072. He appears as domnus Ranimirus, dominator Sanacti Stefani (lord Ramiro, lord of Saint Stephen) on 6 August that year. He can be seen subsequently involved in the politics of the neighbouring Kingdom of Aragon, when he witnessed a charter of Garsias [...] Aragonensium episcopus (Garc√≠a [...] bishop of the Aragonese) introducing the Augustinian rule into the cathedral of San Pedro de Jaca (1076/9), using only the formula regis filius (son of the king).This paragraph draws on the Medieval Lands Project to describe Ramiro's activities in Navarre. In Castile In 1076 Sancho IV was assassinated, leaving infant heirs, and the kingdom's neighbors pounced on the opportunity. The western provinces were annexed by Alfonso VI of Castile while in Pamplona, the capital, Sancho Ram√≠rez of Aragon was elected king by the nobles. Bernard Reilly believed that Ramiro became a ward of Alfonso VI at N√°jera in June and July 1076, but as Ramiro must have been an adult this seems unlikely.Reilly, 89. See Medieval Lands Project for a refutation. He was certainly at the Castilian court by 3 September 1079, however, when he and his sister Ermesinda signed confirmed a charter of Aldefonsus (Alfonso) imperator totius Hispanie.Brother and sister are referred to as Ranemirus Garsie regis filius, Ermensinda G regis filia. Ermesinda married Fort√∫n S√°nchez, lord of Yarnoz, while Ramiro's other sister, Urraca, married Garc√≠a Ord√≥√±ez, a powerful Castilian magnate. Ramiro appears as lord of Calahorra between 1076 and 1082.Fletcher 1989, 137. On 18 April 1081, Alfonso VI confirmed Ramiro's donation of property to Santa Mar√≠a la Real of N√°jera,Barton 1997, 249. which his father had founded, and he donated a servant to San Mart√≠n de Albelda on 23 January 1082. Death The circumstances surrounding Ramiro's death are narrated at length by the Historia Roderici.For which, with introduction and translation, see Barton and Fletcher 2000, 90‚Äì147. In December 1082 Albofalac, the governor of Rueda de Jal√≥n,He is known only from the Historia Roderici, cf. Fletcher 1989, 137. made a pronunciamiento in a favour of Yusuf al-Muzaffar, the imprisoned brother of al-Muqtadir, recently deceased ruler of Zaragoza, and rebelled against al-Mu'tamin, al-Muqtadir's son and successor. At the same time Ibn al- Royolo, who had brought Denia to al-Muqtadir in 1076, was now suspected of intriguing with Alfonso VI against al-Mu'tamin. Further, a recently failed embassy led by Sisnando Davidiz to the court of Zaragoza may have warmed Alfonso to the invitation of Albofalac to take part in his revolt, which he eventually requested.Fletcher 1989, 137. Reilly, 165, points out that Alfonso \\"had been campaigning on the western and southwestern approaches to Zaragoza\\" in the spring and summer, though he was at Castrojeriz in the autumn. Alfonso sent an army under Ramiro Garc√©s and Gonzalo Salvad√≥rez, lord of Lara. Ramiro and Gonzalo held talks with Yusuf, now free (Albofalac had been his jailer), who may have urged them to request the king's presence. Alfonso did appear, but only for a short while.Fletcher 1989, 138, though Reilly, 165, believes that Alfonso did not appear until later, after Yusuf had died and the castle itself was offered, and that only then did he send Ramiro and Gonzalo. After his departure, Yusuf suddenly died. Albofalac, through Ramiro, then invited Alfonso to take possession of his castle of Rueda, and the king sent Ramiro and Gonzalo under a safe conduct.The Historia Roderici credits Ramiro for this discussion, cf. Barton and Fletcher 2000, 108‚Äì9. When they and their men entered the castle, they were massacred by the garrison, who pelted them with stones.Fletcher 1989, 138, says \\"Albofalac seems to have panicked\\". One of the nobles killed was Ramiro's half-brother, Sancho Garc√©s. The disaster is placed in 1084 by the Annales Compostellani, Chronicon Iriense, Chronicon Burgense, and Annales Complutenses. The date of the Historia Roderici, however is confirmed by the Chronica Naierensis and has the support of Ram√≥n Men√©ndez Pidal, Antonio Ubieto Arteta, R. A. Fletcher, and B. F. Reilly.Reilly, 165 note 16. The precise date is found in a document of Sahag√∫n from 18 January 1083, which states, In anno quando occiderunt illos comites in Rota et fuit illa occisione in die Aparicionis Domini (\\"In the year when those counts were killed in Rueda and this killing was on the day of the appearance of the Lord [Theophany]\\"). The Annales del reyno de Navarra of Jos√© Moret Mendi cites a document of Ramiro from 27 May 1083, but that document survives independently and is dated to 1063, so Moret must be taken with caution.

In 1982, Inside Sports was acquired by Evanston, Illinois-based Century Publishing (later renamed Lakeside Publishing). The magazine was resurrected by Editor-in-Chief Michael K. Herbert and ran successfully under the Century banner for nearly 20 years. Los Angeles Times columnist Mike Downey wrote a monthly humor feature, \\"The Good Doctor.\\" Later editors were Vince Aversano, Larry Burke and Ken Leiker. In June 1998, Inside Sports was sold by Century to Petersen Publishing, owner of longtime rival SPORT, and merged the two magazines under the SPORT title. In the two years that followed, SPORT was bought by emap plc and continued to struggle in the market, especially when ESPN the Magazine began filling Inside Sports' old niche in 1998. In August 2000, after appearing every month for 54 years, SPORT magazine ceased publication, thus ending the lineage of Inside Sports.

After they were formed, TOPP began by building a coalition of researchers from all over the world to find and study predators of the Pacific Ocean. Since then, they have satellite-tagged 22 different species and more than 2,000 animals. These animals include elephant seals, great white sharks, leatherback turtles, squid, albatrosses, and more. Through the efforts of TOPP, information never before accessed by humans was now available, such as migration routes and ecosystems, but from the animals', rather than human, aspects. It also became possible to learn about the ocean itself through use of the animals, because they can go where humans cannot. We learn through their everyday actions, and through these data, researchers have been able to determine better ways of protecting endangered species, such as the leatherback turtle. The tagging research is ongoing, but the TOPP program itself ended in 2010. Organization In addition to the NOAA‚Äôs Pacific Fisheries Ecosystems Lab, Stanford‚Äôs Hopkins Marine Lab, and University of California, Santa Cruz‚Äôs Long Marine Laboratory, a wide range of people contribute to the success of the program, including marine biologists, oceanographers, engineers, computer programmers, journalists, graphic designers, educators and the public who provide support. Tagging A CDT tag taken off an elephant seal at A√±o Nuevo State Reserve Many different types of tags are used in the TOPP tagging program, each designed for different marine animals and different types of data. Archival tags, though small, are very powerful, and can last up to 10 years. Researchers surgically implant them into the bellies of tuna, where the tags record, as often as every few seconds, pressure (for depth of dives), ambient light (to estimate location), internal and external body temperature, and, in some cases, speed of travel. The tags are small and light enough to be attached to the outside of an animal, such as the tail feathers of red-footed boobies. However, they do have a drawback, they have to be retrieved. So, they are useful for fish likely to be caught as seafood, such as bluefin or yellowfin tuna, or animals that return to rookeries or nesting beaches, such as boobies and leatherback turtles. Pop-up satellite archival tags (PSATs), also known simply as pop-up archival tags (PATs), are just like archival tags, except they are designed to release at a preset time, like 30 days. They then float to the surface and send their data via an Argos satellite back to the laboratory for two weeks, which is the life of its battery. Even when the battery dies, the data are saved on the tag, so if it is ever recovered, the whole data set can be downloaded. This tag is useful for animals that do not spend a lot of time at the surface, and are not caught often. Numerous white sharks have been tagged with this tag. The tags are attached to white sharks by inserting a small surgical titanium anchor into it. On elephant seals, the tag is glued to the fur. Connecting the tag to the anchor is a thin line that loops around a metal pin at the base of the tag. This metal pin is connected to a battery. A clock in the tag turns the battery on at a preprogrammed time. When the battery turns on, the attachment pin dissolves. The tag floats to the surface and starts transmitting data to one of the Argos satellites. Spot tags, or smart positioning, or temperature transmitting tags, are ideal tags for air- breathing marine animals (seals, whales and sea turtles) and animals that often swim close to the surface (salmon sharks, blue sharks and makos). When the antenna breaks the surface, it sends data to a satellite. The data include pressure, speed, and water temperature. Location is estimated by calculating the Doppler shift in the transmission signal in successive transmissions. When the animal goes beneath the surface, a saltwater switch turns off the tag. The tag, made by Wildlife Computers, lasts about two years. Satellite relay data logger (SRDL) tags compress data so more information can be transmitted through the Argos satellite. These can be outfitted with CTD tags to record the salinity, temperature and depth data oceanographers need to identify ocean currents and water. Elephant seals, sea lions and leatherback sea turtles wear these tags. Programs An elephant seal named Ellie tagged though TOPP TOPP has also set up programs to engage the public in learning about marine science and marine conservation. One of its programs is called Elephant Seal Homecoming Days, which was started by TOPP in 2008 for the months the northern elephant seals return to A√±o Nuevo State Reserve during the breeding season. TOPP picks around 10 of the many they tagged to become \\"spokes-seals\\" for the public, allowing them to see what it is like being one of the biggest seals in the world. Elephant seals are prime candidates for tagging because they tend to return to the same beach every year to breed, yielding high tag recovery. They can gather immense amounts of information because they can swim for thousands of miles. The seals are issued their own Facebook profile that is kept up for them by undergraduate volunteer keepers. Facebook profiles keep the public updated on their progress while they give birth and proceed to take care of their pups. Two seals are the stars of TOPP Elephant Seal Homecoming Days. The first is Penelope Seal, who has been part of the program since 2008. The second one is new as of 2009, and his name is Stelephant Colbert (in reference to Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report). *Early years Stelephant started out as a mere pup in a small harem of northern elephant seals located at A√±o Nuevo State Reserve. He has since grown into one of the most famous elephant seals ever, even appearing on The Colbert Report. Around eight years old, Stelephant is a 4,500-pound beast. Not known as the pretty-boy, he gets by on his aggressiveness and determination to get as close to females as possible. With his proboscis, or nose, high in the air, almost any male is turned away unless they wish to fight. These fights are not known to last for long, however, because Stelephant is a seasoned fighter and knows how to win. He is what every male elephant seal strives to be, huge, strong, and proud. When Stelephant Colbert was weaned, he spent the next few weeks on the beach waiting for the courage to go and join the adult seals out in the northern Pacific Ocean. He returned the next year to the same beach on the California coast as a yearling, where he was exiled to the outskirts of the harems with all the other yearlings. The next few years were spent building muscle and growing large to be able to compete with the larger males. During his third to fifth year, Stelephant practiced his fighting skills with other young males to build strength; while he did compete with the adults, he was not much competition and spent most of his days far away from females. When he was around seven years old with his proboscis finally grown in, he was finally ready to compete with the adult males for the alpha position. *Tagging Stelephant has been involved with the University of California, Santa Cruz Long Marine Lab researchers, and was tagged last spring to track his foraging habits while swimming and diving off the Aleutian Islands in the northern Pacific Ocean. *Current Stelephant was issued his own Facebook page, where people can keep track of his whereabouts and his status updates. He is the most talked-about seal in the program in that he was featured in the Santa Cruz Sentinel, the Associated Press, and many additional media organizations. The biggest media event was when Stephen Colbert of The Colbert Report, after whom Stelephant is named, spoke of his seal on his show. Stelephant was featured in one of the show episodes, creating a media buzz. Since then, Stelephant‚Äôs fan based has skyrocketed bringing attention to TOPP and the UCSC Long Marine Lab who Stelephant is associated with. Stelephant has enabled TOPP to engage the public in learning about northern elephant seals, marine science, and marine conservation. Stelephant is now an alpha male at A√±o Nuevo State Reserve, and will soon return to the ocean to forage once again. Stelephant was featured on Oceans Google Earth, which allows the user to explore the oceans. His tags were recovered in January and he was not tagged again. Penelope Seal Penelope Seal is an elephant seal and one of the many marine animals tagged as a part of the TOPP program. Penelope was born as a \\"little\\" pup in early January 1998 at the A√±o Nuevo State Reserve on the Californian coast. Since then, she has become a full grown female northern elephant seal with six pups of her own, and many fans who have contributed to her fame. From five years old, she has had one pup a year, all at A√±o Nuevo State Reserve. Penelope Seal is known as gnarly seal and a survivor, considering 50% of her species will die before they reach maturity. She has dark-brown fur that she molts (or sheds) once a year. The beach is a known hangout spot of hers and one can usually spot her basking in the sun, or if its raining, cuddling up to another elephant seal. She has had multiple relationships, never known to be a monogamous seal, and in fact living in a polygynous society. The group, or harem, is made up of many other females and an alpha male with which Penelope has been known to hang out. However, Penelope has also been seen socializing with some other beta males around the harem, much to the dismay of the alpha. *Early life Penelope spent her early life as a weaner, or weaned pup, at A√±o Nuevo State Reserve. During this time she fasted on the beach waiting until she was brave enough to go out into the open ocean for the first time. The next year she became a yearling and spent her days being shunned from her harem, since she was still small compared to the others. Years two and three were spent much the same way. During this period she learned a lot about how to become a successful predator, like being able to travel all the way out into the northern Pacific Ocean and back again without any maps, and making it to the same place every time, which can be around an journey. However, when she was four years old, she became pregnant with her first pup and gave birth to him 10 months later at A√±o Nuevo State Reserve. *Tagging Penelope is tagged with a small tag and collects data for the TOPP team's researchers. Penelope's tag has a time depth recorder,http://www.lotek.com/archival.htm which documents the dive depth, dive duration, and light levels. Elephant seals are incredible divers and allow scientists to learn about their unique behavior and the environment in which they live. Elephant seals are prime candidates for tagging because they tend to return to the same beach every year to breed, yielding high tag recovery. They can gather immense amounts of information because they can swim for thousands of miles. Penelope herself has been involved with the University of California, Santa Cruz Long Marine Lab researchers and was tagged last year. *Current Penelope has since had her seventh pup, and is living on the beaches of A√±o Nuevo State Reserve. She was not tagged this year. Stelephant Colbert has since taken on the challenge of promoting elephant seals, and has been quite successful. Penelope is featured on the new version of Ocean Google Earth, which allows the user to explore the oceans. Penelope can be located at A√±o Nuevo State Reserve. Penelope Seal has been the star of Elephant Seal Homecoming Days for the past two years. She enabled TOPP to engage the public in learning about northern elephant seals, marine science, and marine conservation. The Great Turtle Race The Great Turtle Race is an international sea turtle conservation event that brings together corporate sponsors and conservation organizations. The race tracks sea turtles as they move toward feeding areas south of the Galapagos Islands after nesting at Playa Grande in Costa Rica‚Äôs Las Baulas National Park, the primary nesting area for leatherbacks in the Pacific. TOPP is a cosponsor of The Great Turtle Race, and tracking technology created and used by TOPP is how the turtles are tracked. The race occurred in 2007 and 2008 in April.http://www.wildlifeextra.com/go/news/leatherback-race.html#cr See also *Albatross *A√±o Nuevo State Reserve *Elephant seal *Great white shark *Leatherback turtle *Leopard seal *Pinniped *Squid *The Marine Mammal Center ReferencesExternal links *Tagging of Pacific Predators *Top Predators Timeline - Smithsonian Ocean Portal *NBC Nightly News, Our Planet *Wildlife Extra *Costa Lab *Producer's Notes:Tagging of Pacific Predators *The Scientist:Laboratory Websites and Video Awards *Tagging of Pacif Predators Educator Guide *Census of Marine Life Projects *Eurek Alert, Google Ocean *Underwatertimes.com, Google Ocean *TOPP Facebook *UC Santa Cruz Long Marine Lab *Dan Costa's Laboratory *Jon Sealwarts Hair Seen From Space *Other TOPP programs *Stelephant Colbert featured on The Colbert Report *Introducing Stelephant Colbert the Elephant Seal *TOPP predators *Penelope Returns *UC Santa Cruz Long Marine Lab *Dan Costa's Laboratory *Elephant Seal Homecoming Days *Stelephant Colbert blog *The Great Turtle Race Category:Marine biology Category:Ecological experiments Category:Pinnipeds ","title":"Tagging of Pacific Predators"},{"id":"21665351","text":"Route 21 may refer to: *Route 21 (MTA Maryland), a bus route in Baltimore, Maryland *London Buses route 21 *Shanghai Metro Line 21, a subway line in Shanghai See also *List of highways numbered 21 21 ","title":"Route 21 (disambiguation)"},{"id":"21665353","text":"Charles Magill (July 10, 1759 ‚Äì April 18, 1827) was a United States Circuit Judge of the United States Circuit Court for the Fourth Circuit.

She is the Sydney E. Junkins Professor of Engineering at Dartmouth College, where she has served as Dean of Thayer School of Engineering. Elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the National Academy of Engineers, and the National Academy of Inventors, she helped pioneer laser technology and is an expert in nonlinear optics. She has patented devices to enhance optical communications including lasers, waveguides, and detectors. Garmire was an Optical Society (OSA) Board Member from 1983-1985 and was elected Vice President in 1991. She served as the 1993 OSA President and has been active on many Awards Committees. Garmire is currently a member of the OSA Presidential Advisory Committee. In 2019 Garmire was named the first woman to become an OSA Honorary Member \\"For contributions to nonlinear optics and optoelectronics, leadership in linking science and public policy, and for service to OSA.\\"  Early Life and Education  Elsa Garmire was born in Buffalo, New York, in 1939. Her father worked as a chemical engineer, working on the design of chemistry labs for the Argonne National Laboratory. Her mother studied music and gave violin lessons but was mostly a stay-at-home wife. Garmire had two sisters, one elder and one younger. Early in her life, Garmire's family moved a lot as, despite having a PhD in Chemistry, her father spent years finding a well-paying job during the Great Depression. Garmire decided to become a scientist when, in the sixth grade, she was handed a brochure about research scientist careers. As a high school student in the 1950s, she topped her class, earning all A's. Garmire decided to join Radcliffe College, a former partner school to the male-only Harvard College, owing to its reputation as a challenging college. Garmire received her B.A. in physics in 1961 at Radcliffe College, one of three women studying physics there at the time. After Radcliffe, she received her PhD in physics at MIT in 1965, where she was assigned to assist Professor Charles Townes, the 1964 Nobel laureate and inventor of the laser. She was the first student he took on at MIT. \\"The laser had been first demonstrated one year before [she] started grad school,\\" Garmire said. \\"[She] had never heard of it ... And [Townes] assigned me to get started on the second laser that was commercially sold.\\" During her PhD, Garmire demonstrated important nonlinear effects produced by powerful laser beams acting on atoms and molecules. Career and Research Garmire spent her early career at California Institute of Technology as a senior research fellow. Following a couple of years in industry, Garmire joined the University of Southern California where she became William Hogue Professor of Electrical Engineering, Professor of Physics, and Director of the Center for Laser Studies. In 1995, after 20 years at USC, Garmire moved to Dartmouth College where she served as dean of the Thayer School of Engineering. She was the first female dean the Thayer School of Engineering. However, Garmire served as dean for only two years before returning to a faculty member position, as she preferred to stay in research. Author of over 250 journal papers and holder of nine patents, she has been on the editorial board of five technical journals. She is a member of the National Academy of Engineering and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, a fellow of the American Physical Society, and a fellow of the Optical Society of America; she has served on the boards of three other professional societies. In 1994 she received the Society of Women Engineers Achievement Award. She has been a Fulbright senior lecturer and a visiting faculty member in Japan, Australia, Germany, and China. She has been chair of the NSF Advisory Committee on Engineering Technology and served on the NSF Advisory Committee on Engineering and the Air Force Science Advisory Board. Professor Garmire was elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1989 for contributions to nonlinear optics and optoelectronics and for leadership in education. Work with laser art In the summer of 1968, Garmire joined the organization Experiments in Art and Technology. She used laser light in artistic presentations, such as a July 1969 \\"laser wall\\" made of argon laser beams through which spectators could walk. For the Pepsi Pavilion at Expo '70 in Osaka, Garmire helped E.A.T. build \\"the world's largest hemispherical mirror.\\" In her Caltech lab, Garmire experimented with light patterns caused by shining laser beams through transparent random or structured materials, such as dried clear glue on glass or patterned Plexiglas. These diffused the coherent light into abstract shapes with pure colors, internal diffraction pattern texture, and a shimmering speckle. By rotating the diffusing material, the shapes would slowly evolve into new forms. In November 1970 filmmakers Ivan Dryer and Dale Pelton visited Garmire's lab, filmed the moving patterns and set them to music. The resulting short movie, LaserImage, dissatisfied both Dryer and Garmire as it lacked the vibrant colors and speckle of live laser light. In December 1970, they proposed to the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles to present a live laser show in the planetarium, to be called Laserium. The Griffith director at that time turned down the proposal. She later mused, \\"I did not patent my idea. I‚Äôm a great believer that people should do it. In fact in 1971, I suggested that there could be a home laser light show, and I demonstrated it on television.\\" In January 1973 Dryer formed a company called Laser Images Inc., with Garmire as president. The company used lasers for a few concerts and special events. In June 1973, Dryer did a demonstration at Caltech attended by the new director of the Griffith. He agreed to a one-month trial at the Griffith. The first Laserium show was held November 19, 1973. By the end of the trial, 500 people a night had to be turned away from the shows. At some point, Garmire left the company, later saying \\"I loved it. I loved the classical music. And when they switched to the rock music, that‚Äôs when I decided to absent myself.\\" While Garmire was not the first \\"laser artist\\", it was her work with Dryer that led to the popularization of laser light shows as an ongoing, regularly scheduled presentation. Laser Images' Laserium shows were eventually presented in 46 cities and were seen by over 20 million people as of 2002.  Personal Life and Retirement  Elsa Garmire retired from her job as the Sydney E. Junkins 1887 Professor of Engineering at Dartmouth in 2016. \\"She[Garmire] was a very important, early and pioneering contributor to the development of the laser,\\" said Joseph J. Helble, dean of the Thayer School of Engineering and Professor of Engineering at Dartmouth, \\"\\"She[Garmire] really contributed to the fundamental understanding of how lasers operate, how laser phenomena operate, what lasers do to break down other material, and eventually contributed her understanding and her development to fundamental physics, which led to the development of things like semiconductor lasers that are ubiquitous.\\"  Awards  * 2019, Honorary Member of The Optical Society * 2014, National Academy of Inventors¬Æ (NAI) Charter Fellow * 2004, National Associate of the National Academies * 1996, Member, American Academy of Arts and Sciences * 1994, Fellow, American Physical Society * 1994, Achievement Award and Fellow, Society of Women Engineers * 1989, Life Member, National Academy of Engineering * 1980, Fellow and Life Member, Institute of Electronics and Electrical Engineers * 1981, Fellow of The Optical Society of America (now The Optical Society)  See also  *Past Presidents of the OSA  References  Sources External links * Articles Published by early OSA Presidents Journal of the Optical Society of America Category:Presidents of the Optical Society Category:21st-century American physicists Category:Living people Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society Category:American women physicists Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Laser art Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:University of Southern California faculty Category:Dartmouth College faculty Category:Fellows of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences Category:Fellow Members of the IEEE Category:Fulbright Scholars Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Women in optics Category:Women in science and technology ","title":"Elsa M.

It was designed by John James Clark and built in 1886 by Charles Miller. It is also known as Charters Towers Courthouse. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. History left The Charters Towers Courthouse was designed in 1885 by the Queensland Colonial Architect, John James Clark, as one of a series of substantial courthouses in major regional centres. It was completed in 1887 and extended by the addition of a wing in 1890. Discovered in late 1871, Charters Towers became the richest of the North Queensland mining fields. The field was proclaimed a municipality (the Borough of Charters Towers) in 1877 and had become a prosperous settlement by 1882 when the Great Northern Railway line connected Charters Towers to the coast. Charters Towers gold was in deep reefs and the equipment needed to extract and process it was financed by substantial southern and overseas investment. The town became a major regional centre providing employment for a considerable number of people. The 1880s was a period of expansion in Queensland generally as the economy enjoyed a boom and people poured into the colony. This necessitated an increase in police numbers and court facilities. In fact, police and judiciary facilities were constructed at such a pace in this period that it became difficult to obtain suitably qualified contractors. Charters Towers was amongst a number of regional centres where substantial new courthouses were erected, probably in response to the increase in its importance and population and in keeping with the handsome new buildings then rapidly replacing the modest structures of the early township. The new courthouse was designed by noted architect J.J. Clark, who was at the time Colonial Architect. John James Clark was born and trained in Liverpool, England. He arrived in Melbourne in 1853 and won a number of architectural competitions; his success in such competitions being a feature of his career. Clark designed some major public buildings in Melbourne, including the Treasury, then moved to Sydney in 1881 and in 1883 became Queensland Colonial Architect. Although he left the position in 1885, he was responsible for some important public buildings during this time, including courthouses at Mackay, Rockhampton and Warwick. They and the Charters Towers courthouse were designed in the classical revival style thought appropriate for public buildings intended to convey a sense of stability and dignity, particularly a courthouse which represented the power of the law. The Charters Towers courthouse was constructed by contractor Charles Miller at a cost of and opened on 9 February 1887. The local newspaper, The Northern Miner, indulged in some critical remarks about the appearance of the building, describing it as \\"unpretentious\\", but admitted that it was commodious and well ventilated. In general style and layout it resembled that of the courthouse at Mackay, built about the same time. Apart from the court, rooms were provided for the judge, police magistrate, Clerk of Petty Sessions, jury, witnesses and gold warden, plus a number of other offices. Even so, by 1890 the building had become inadequate, reflecting the rapid growth of the city. Local building contractor, Benjamin Toll, was employed to construct a large brick extension with verandahs on three sides alongside the court and connected to it. The courthouse has changed little since and has served the Charters Towers and district community in this capacity for over a hundred years, with the 1890s wing now providing office space for the Department of Mines and Energy and the Department of Natural Resources.  Description  Architectural drawing of the new Court House, Charters Towers, 1885 The courthouse consists of 2 brick buildings parallel to each other and connected at the rear. They are situated on a large government reserve at the corner of Hodgkinson and Church Streets, Charters Towers, along with the former School of Mines. Perspective view of the Court House, 1888 The original courthouse is a classical revival building of rendered brick with a corrugated iron roof and is set well back facing Hodgkinson Street. The core of the building is the court room which rises to 2 storeys and is approached through a slightly lower portico with a Tuscan order arcade of 3 bays separated by square pilasters rising through 2 stories to the triangular pediment, which has a circular louvred vent in its centre. This entrance is flanked by single storey attached pavilions with pyramid roofs. These have pairs of sash windows shaded by a sun hood on cast iron brackets. The rear of the building has similar pavilion style wings linked by a verandah, and a verandah links the front and rear pavilions on the western side. The eastern verandah area is now used for disabled parking. The rear pavilion on the eastern side is linked to the newer building and now houses a tea room. It retains a chimney and corner fireplace. Other rooms to the rear include offices and a strong room. The court room is still in use for this purpose and has plastered walls and a rather austere coffered ceiling. There is a public gallery at the northern end. It retains cedar furniture and fittings. Rear extension from 1890, as seen in 1997 The 1890s extension building is set back from the older building and only joins it towards the rear. It is constructed of brick with a gambrel roof clad in corrugated iron and is basically rectangular in form. For much of its length it is free standing, having a ground floor verandah and awning which encircles the front and sides. This is supported on posts with decorative brackets. The building is symmetrical and has its own central entrance consisting of double doors flanked by windows and approached from across the verandah by low steps. It houses the offices of the Department of Justice and Attorney General and other government department tenancies.  Heritage listing  Charters Towers Courthouse was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Charters Towers, as an extraordinarily rich goldfield, made a major contribution to the economy of Queensland and to the development of the North. The Charters Towers Courthouse, constructed in 1886 and extended in the 1890s, demonstrates the growth of Charters Towers as a major goldfield and reflects its importance as a regional centre in the late 19th century. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The court room remains substantially unchanged since completion and retains the major components of its original furniture, which is now rare. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The courthouse is characteristic of major regional courthouses, influenced by classical revival styles imbuing tradition and authority and providing a lofty courtroom with attendant offices. It is a fine example of a public building of its era and demonstrates the high quality work produced by the Colonial Architect's office in the late nineteenth century. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. As a substantial and prominently sited public building, of architectural merit, it makes an important visual contribution to the character of Charters Towers. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The courthouse has had a long connection with the people of Charters Towers and the surrounding district as the focus for the administration of justice in the area. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. As a major public building designed during his tenure as Colonial architect, the courthouse has important associations with the life and work of JJ Clark who made an important contribution to the development of architecture in Queensland.

There is also a new mining museum in Tangshan where Kinder is acknowledged as a respected pioneering engineer. was employed for its construction, which was completed in 1881. The Rocket of China Kinder insisted on building the tramway to the international Standard gauge of , to make sure the tramway could be turned into a full railway. He also set about constructing a steam locomotive using the boiler and other parts from a portable steam winding engine borrowed from the colliery. After word had leaked out about its construction, the engine had to be concealed for several weeks until Viceroy Li Hung Chang gave word for the construction to continue. The result of Kinder's efforts came to fruition on 9 June 1881 when the home- made 2-4-0 tank engine christened ‚ÄúRocket of China‚Äù entered service on the tramway.Percy Horace Kent: ‚ÄúRailway Enterprise in China‚Äù, London, 1907The significance of this famous English name ‚ÄúRocket‚Äù for a steam locomotive was not fully understood by the local Chinese mine workers who soon referred to this little fire breathing, smoke and steam puffing ‚Äúmonster‚Äù as the ‚ÄúDragon‚Äù (ÈæçËôü s:ÈæôÂè∑), . In deference to Chinese preferences for this name, Kinder had a pair of brass dragons made to adorn the locomotive sides next to the English name plates. (refs: P.H. Kent:‚ÄùRailway Enterprise in China‚Äù and ‚ÄúChina in Decay‚Äù, Alex Krausse, London 1900) =The first imported locomotives= Stevenson tank locomotive No. 3 with train near Xugezhuang station c. 1882 The introduction of ‚ÄúRocket‚Äù was highly successful and in June 1882 two 0-6-0 tank locomotives were ordered from Robert Stephenson & Co., Newcastle. They arrived in October and were given running numbers 2 and 3.According to the Stephenson archives, the works numbers of these engines (ordered through the company‚Äôs London agent, James Whittall), were 2397 & 2398, and Kinder describes them as having coupled 42‚Äùwheels and 10¬Ω‚Äùx 18‚Äù cylinders.C.W.Kinder private papers \\"Notes on Imperial Chinese Railways 1863-1900\\" from Hong Kong Railway Society's P.A.Crush Chinese Railway Collection These were the first two standard gauge locomotives imported into China. While some sources claim that an 0-4-0 engine numbered ‚Äú0‚Äù now preserved in the Beijing Locomotive Museum was the first engine imported into China,‚ÄúA Picture Album of Steam Locomotives in China 1876-2001‚Äù published by China Railway Publishing House 2001 this is unlikely to be accurate.It is the view of many Chinese railway history researchers that this locomotive is more likely the remains of an 1887 Black, Hawthorn & Co construction locomotive weighing 8 tons (Works No. 869). This information is derived from works records and June 25, 1888 edition of the ‚ÄúCelestial Times‚Äù (published in Shanghai), which refers to a report that such an engine had been landed at Tianjin on 14 June 1888 and that this engine was for extension work of the ‚ÄúNorthern Railway‚Äù. The timing of the arrival of this engine in 1888 also coincides with the placing of advertisements by Black, Hawthorn in ‚ÄúThe London and China Express‚Äù in January 1888 suggesting that this locomotive manufacturer was at that time engaged in some limited commercial activity in China. (ref: ICE-Kinder2474, P.H.Kent and Robert Stephenson & Co. archives:- extract from the ‚ÄúEngine Order Book‚Äù for two engines, Works Nos 2397 and 2398. Order received 9 June 1882.) Chou Fu =The first extension to Lutai= While the Kaiping mine railway maintained operations, the Imperial Court's opposition to railway development in China prevented any further development for several years. But because the canal would become covered with ice during the winter months, the mining company succeeded in 1886 in gaining permission to extend the tramway all the way to Lutai. The extension was carried out by a newly formed Kaiping Railway Company (Kaiping Tiehlu Gongsi ÈñãÂπ≥ÈêµË∑ØÂÖ¨Âè∏ s:ÂºÄÂπ≥ÈìÅË∑ØÂÖ¨Âè∏), separately funded from the mining company, chaired by the Tientsin Taotai (Tianjin daotai Â§©Ê¥• ÈÅìÂè∞) Chou Fu (Zhou Fu Âë®È¶•). The managing director was Wu Tingfang, who had studied law in England and was also interpreter and secretary to Li Hung Chang. Assisted by the young American-educated student engineer (a Yung Wing mission student), Kwang King Yang (Kuang Jingyang ÈÑ∫ÊôØÊèö s: ÈÇùÊôØÊâ¨ ) also known as K.Y. Kwong and Kuang Sunmou, Kinder supervised the building of the extension which was completed in April 1887. Imported German Krupp rails were used, as well as a ten-wheeled 2-6-2 saddle-tank locomotive from the Grant Locomotive Works of New Jersey (No.4), and forty 10-ton coal wagons. =Second extension to Dagu and Tianjin= Soon afterward, Viceroy Li pressed for a further extension to Beitang and TakuThe railway station was actually located on the opposite side of the river at Tanggu for military purposes. Kinder was called upon to survey the route. Li had to overcome opposition in the Imperial Court but gained sanction for the line to be extended 50 miles to Tianjin. Kinder, as Chief Engineer of the now newly named China Railway Company, was then permitted to secure the services of several more foreign engineers which included Resident Engineers A.W.H. Bellingham and W. Watson. The whole project was completed within fourteen months, with limited train services commencing in August 1888.‚ÄúChina‚Äôs First Railway - The Imperial Railways of North China 1880-1911‚Äù by A.L. Rosembaum, (unpublished Yale thesis 1972)> This period of railway development was not smooth sailing, and there was continued opposition to the railway on a number of fronts. At various times there were organized riots against the railway and in one instance thousands of dollars worth of damage was done to mining equipment at the Tongshan colliery when a violent feud erupted between Cantonese and northern Chinese workers.Extracts from the personal diary of William Bulmer, 1881-1884 (who was employed by CE&MC; at Tangshan as a boiler maker) from ‚Äú P. A. Crush Chinese Railway Collection‚Äù, Hong Kong Railway Society Another severe blow was China's first-recorded serious train accident on 25 March 1889 when there was a head-on collision between two trains at Chung Liang Cheng (Junliangcheng ËªçÁ≥ßÂüé s: ÂÜõÁ≤ÆÂüé). English train driver, M. Jarvis, had waited a long time in the station passing loop and impatiently entered the next section of single track before the arrival of an oncoming train. As a result of the collision, four carriages caught fire and several injured people were burned alive. Driver Dawson survived but the offending driver, Jarvis, one fireman and seven passengers died in the crash, while more died several days later from their burns and injuries. It was alleged by junior staff that Jarvis had been drinking heavily before the crash.‚ÄúThe Chinese Times‚Äù March 30th 1889 edition, published in ShanghaiThe locomotives at this time were driven by mainly English drivers and a few local Chinese, all under the charge of Locomotive Superintendent G.D. Churchwood. The Traffic Department was headed by Manager R.W. Lemmon with two English Head-Guards with a staff of local officers.The hapless junior Chinese stationmaster, who had attempted to restrain the errant British driver, was partially blamed for this crash and disciplined. In an obvious case of racialist bias, the English press in Shanghai blamed the railway company ‚Äúfor making unjustified economies‚Äù and ‚Äúfailing to employ enough foreign guards and supervisors‚Äù. They overlooked the obvious i.e. had all the drivers then been Chinese and not foreign drivers, the chances of enforcing discipline on the driver would have been that much easier.(refs: ‚ÄúChronicle & Directory for China, Corea, Japan, The Philippines etc.‚Äù years: 1880-1890 & The Celestial Times) Further troubles came weeks later, in April 1888, when a newly completed steel bridge across the Pei Ho river (today's Haihe Êµ∑Ê≤≥) in the heart of Tientsin, connecting with the foreign settlements, caused unrest with local boatmen fearful that the railway would harm their interests. Li ordered the destruction of the bridge by dynamite, causing the company a loss of ¬£8000 and many months work.Chinese Times, April 6th & 20 May 11th & 18th 1889 =Towards Beijing and Shanhaiguan= Tiantsin railway station with foreign military officers at 1900 Shortly after the completion of the Tientsin section pressure was exerted for permission to build extensions westwards to Beijing and northeastwards towards the Great Wall. Imperial Court opposition prevented the western extension but the northern extension was sanctioned and reached Guye in late 1890, Lanchou in 1892 and Shanhaiguan in 1893,Institution of Civil Engineers vol. clx 1905 Paper No.3509 : ‚ÄúRailway Construction in North China‚Äù by Edward Hulme Rigby BSc and William Orr Leitch AMICE during which period the line was transferred to the control of a newly formed Imperial Chinese Railway Administration.) During this period of expansion, Jeme Tien Yow joined the railway company in 1888 as a cadet engineer under Kinder's supervision. Kinder appreciated the talents of this Yale-graduated engineer and Jeme was soon promoted first to Resident and then District Engineer. In all ,Jeme spent 12 years working on various sections of this railway. He later achieved international recognition as the Engineer-in-Chief who built the Imperial Peking-Kalgan Railway without any foreign assistance.\\"Railway Wonders of the World\\" - 'A Wonderful Chinese Railway The First Line to be Financed, Built and Operates Solely by Celestial Effort' by F.A. Talbot, London c.1913 =Further northwards into Manchuria= Hu Yufen Plans to continue the railway North-eastwards beyond Shan Hai Kuan (Shanhaiguan) to Jinzhou, Shenyang and Jilin were prevented by lack of funds and because of war between Japan and China (August 1894 to March 1895). By 1896 the rails had only reached Chung Ho So (pinyin: Zhonghesuo ‰∏≠Ê≤≥ÊâÄ), some 40 miles beyond Shan Hai Kuan. China's loss of the war with Japan brought about Li Hung Chang's disgrace and virtual removal from power, and with this came new management. After a short power struggle between rival factions Sheng Hsuan Huai (pinyin: Sheng Xuanhuai succeeded in gaining control of this new organization and appointed his own supporters to the directorate of whom the most prominent of these was Hu Yu-fen who was appointed Director-General and made responsible for the all sections of the ‚ÄúNorthern‚Äù Railway and the name evolved yet again in 1897 into ‚ÄúImperial Railways of North China‚Äù\\"Eminent Chinese of the Ch‚Äôing Period 1644-1912\\", edited by Arthur W Hummel, United States Government Printing Office, 1943.China‚Äôs Early Industrialization: Shang Hsuan-huai (1844-1916), A Feuerwerker, Harvard University Press 1958.At this time construction of the Southern trunk line from Lugouqiao to Hankow had also commenced but Director-General Hu was not given responsibility for this line. Kinder and his engineering staff, however, had surveyed and commenced building the first section of this railway to Baoding 1887-9. In 1899 the British engineers were unceremoniously removed from this work, having been replaced by a Belgian syndicate =A Peking (Beijing) terminus at Ma Chia Pu (Majiabao)= Ma Chia Pu terminus before June 1900 During the period 1898-9 a British loan of ‚Ç§2,300,000 was negotiated and an issue of bonds raised in London for the purpose of extending this line northwards to Xinmin and a branch line from Koupangtzu to Yingkou. The loan was arranged by the British and Chinese Corporation, a joint venture and front for the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and Jardine Matheson and Company. In spite of objections from the Russians (who were themselves busy grabbing control of Chinese territory in Manchuria) the line to Chinchou was eventually completed in 1899. Back at the western end of the railway the line had reached Fengtai and shortly afterwards a new Ma Chiu Pu terminus outside Peking in 1897 from where a Siemens built electric tramway was laid to the city's South Gate, or Yongdingmen, which opened for service in 1899. =Boxer Destruction= The next set-back for the railway was the Boxer Uprising of 1900 which brought a complete halt to railway construction progress and also resulted in large sections of the existing railway in around Peking and Tientsin being totally wrecked by the Boxers. This included the killing of the railway's recently appointed new Managing-Director, Hsu Ching Cheng (pinyin: Xu Jingcheng Ë®±ÊôØÊæÑ) who was dragged out of his office and executed by pro-Boxer Court hardliners for being ‚Äútoo pro foreign‚Äù. Hsu had replaced the previous Director, Hu Yu-fen in early 1899 after a palace coup in late 1898 which saw the Empress Dowager Cixi suppress the reformist young Guangxu Emperor and grab power back into her own hands.‚ÄúThe Siege at Peking‚Äù by Peter Fleming, London 1959 =Foreign military administration 1900 - 1902= Following the relief of the besieged foreign legations in Peking by an international allied expeditionary force the Chinese government lost control of what remained of the badly damaged railway system for a two-year period of allied foreign occupation. British and other foreign military units repaired the line between Tientsin and Peking (1900‚Äì1902) and the railway was also extended from the Ma Chiu Pu terminus to new Peking stations. The first was adjacent to the Temple of Heaven and a gap was made in the outer city wall for this purpose next to the Yung Ting Men gatehouse. center Cheng Yang Mun station A few months later the foreign military authorities decided to take the railway even closer to central Peking and extended the line to near the front gate of the Tartar city at Zhengyangmen as well as the addition of a branch line eastwards to Tongzhou. Also during this period of foreign military control a small port was developed at Qinhuangdao with a six-mile branch line joining the main line a few miles southwest of Shan Hai Kuan at Tangho. This port, which had been used for landing allied military personnel and supplies, was later turned over to and further developed by the Chinese Engineering & Mining Co. For two years (1900‚Äì1902) the railway was placed under the overall command of a British army ‚ÄúRoyal Engineers‚Äù contingent which used the name ‚ÄúBritish Railway Administration‚Äù (BRA) for the purposes of operating the line as far north as Shan Hai Kuan. From this point the Russians retained control of the line northwards until the whole line was handed back to the Imperial Chinese authorities on 29 September 1902. During the BRA period the railway operated a travelling post office train and a special overprinted Chinese postal stamp was introduced for mailing letters carried by the BRA's express mail trains.‚ÄúRoyal Engineers Journal‚Äù : October 1, 1901, January 1903, and September 1903 and also Royal Engineers Archives, Chatham, Kent: ‚ÄúBritish Railway Administration Reports‚Äù for the Peking-Shanhaikuan Railway, February 1901 to September 1902. =Return to Chinese control 1902= After civilian control of the railway was resumed in late 1902, Claude Kinder was reinstated as Chief Engineer and also given additional and more powerful responsibilities as General Manager. Strongman Yuan Shikai had himself appointed as Director-General of Railways and Kinder's former boss, Hu Yu-fen, who had been ousted in 1899, came back to power as the Assistant Director-General. The Chinese railway administration also had the services of a bright Western-educated new Secretary, returned Chinese Educational Mission student Liang Ju Hao (pinyin: Liang Ruhao Ê¢ÅÊ±ùÊµ©), better known to Europeans as M.T. Liang.‚ÄúWho‚Äôs Who‚Äù in The China Year Book 1921-1922, edited by H.G.W. Woodhead, Tientsin Press. =Reaching Mukden (Shenyang)= During the spring of 1903 construction on the Manchurian extension resumed and by the autumn had reached Hsin Min Tung (Xinming) which initially served as the IRNC's northern terminus for Mukden (Shenyang). During the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-5 the Japanese laid a military narrow gauge line from Hsin Min Tung to Mukden in their bid to oust the Russians. In 1907 this extension was purchased by Imperial Railways of North China and in 1909 the line up-graded to standard gauge with Japanese assistance. The IRNC terminus was later moved to Mukden proper and eventually shared the impressive Shenyang railway terminus which was constructed 1909-1910 by the Japanese South Manchuria Railway. By this time the railway was generally referred to as the ‚ÄòPeking- Mukden Railway‚Äô.‚Äù The Far Eastern Review‚Äù (FER), published Manila, Shanghai & Yokohama, November 1909 under ‚ÄúImperial Railways of North China‚Äù and ‚ÄúChina‚Äôs Struggle for Railroad Development‚Äù by Chang Kia-Ngau, New York, 1943. =Claude William Kinder 1852 - 1936 (Engineer-in-Chief)= 250px Claude William Kinder does not receive very much mention in Chinese historic sources, perhaps because of China's intense sensitivity to the part played by foreigners in China during this period. Kinder, however, played a crucial role in the early development of this first railway. He detested the power struggles and political squabbles between the numerous railway's directors that he worked under but from the point of view of being a reliable and steady man at the helm on the ground, he got on with the job of building and operating the railway while his superiors jostled for power and ‚Äúplayed musical chairs‚Äù. Kinder worked for the Chinese railway for 31 years as Engineer-in-Chief and also later General Manager of the progressively developing IRNC before resigning in May 1909 following a difference of opinion with a new Director-General. Hu Yu-fen, with whom Kinder had in later years enjoyed a cordial relationship, died in 1906 and this led to the appointment in 1907 of a Yuan Shi Kai's prot√©g√©, Liang Shi Yi as the head of a newly created Chief Railway Bureau. Liang in turn appointed independent directors for each of China's different railway lines, which included the IRNC. Within months Kinder had huge differences of opinion with Liang and in particular over the engagement and dismissal of foreign engineers. Unable to reconcile these differences, Kinder submitted his resignation in October 1908 following the termination of three foreign engineers without Liang even consulting Kinder. Kinder left China on retirement in 1909 and never returned.\\"China A New Aspect\\" by H Stringer, London 1929;FER December 1908250px Kinder was appointed C.M.G. by the British in 1900 and in 1905 was created a ‚ÄúMandarin of the Red Button‚Äù (Chinese Official Rank of the Second Class) for meritorious service by the Imperial Chinese Government. He was also awarded the ‚ÄúOrder of the Double Dragon‚Äù (Shuang long bao xing ÈõôÈæçÂØ∂Êòüs: ÂèåÈæôÂÆùÊòü).London Gazette, Friday June 1, 1900 and HKRS-Crush-Collection In a display of growing local nationalism, Liang also snubbed Kinder's recommendation for his Deputy Chief Engineer (Alex Cox) to be promoted as his replacement and chose instead Englishman A. Harvey Bellingham who was then Municipal Engineer for Tientsin. Bellingham, however, died suddenly before taking up the appointment, whereupon Liang leap-frogged a more junior engineer over the head of Cox, as a continuing snub to Kinder. There was much public criticism in the foreign press about Kinder's supposedly shabby treatment by Liang, and Kinder retired to England a bitter man having been given no customary ‚Äúgolden handshake‚Äù for thirty years service. He was also denied payment for some 18 months in unpaid leave pay accumulated over many years.

It is north of the city of Jamestown, North Dakota. Built from April 1952 to September 1953, the dam measures long at the crest and high. It impounds the James River to form the Jamestown Reservoir. A small islet lies shortly upstream of the dam, where the James River previously split into two channels. The dam and reservoir rest on a wide plain of shale where the James River cut a canyon up to wide and deep. The shale (called Pierre Shale) has a dark gray, bedded appearance, and is mostly claystone or siltstone. The valley also contains many traces of alluvium, mainly deposited during the last ice age when the area was heavily glaciated. ConstructionProposal and companies involved= The dam was proposed in 1951. The site selected offered the required storage with the smallest dam and with close access to embankment materials; however, the underlying rock and soil was both unstable and pervious. The problems were considered minor because the extended storage need of the reservoir only consisted of the lower of the reservoir. If this had not compensated for the pervious material, the required excavations to stabilize the dam would have been over to solid bedrock. Bids for dam construction were submitted by several companies in early 1952. A bid of $1,868,862 was offered by the C.F. Lytle Company of Sioux City, Iowa. This bid was accepted, and the contract was awarded on March 25, 1952 with the notice to proceed received on March 31\\\\. The outlet works, which consist of four high-pressure floodgates, were provided by the Hardie-Tynes Manufacturing Company of Birmingham, Alabama, at a cost of $72,995. This contract was awarded on March 10, 1952, and the final shipment of the gates was made during February 1953. =Construction process= Construction began in April 1952. Excavation for the outlet works began the construction process, with excavation for the wide foundation trench beginning in mid-May and excavation for the spillway following in early June. This wide trench served to remove as much unstable material from the foundation as possible. This material was determined to be unsuitable for construction of the dam, and eventually discarded. Placement of concrete commenced in late June. Embankment construction began in late July. The upper portion of the upstream slope of the dam was covered with a layer of riprap, and the lower section was protected by a layer of gravel. By the end of 1952, the construction work was approximately 67% complete. Construction continued at a rapid pace after the beginning of the 1953 season. The upstream conduits for the outlet works were completed in April, and the four high pressure gates were installed beginning April 1\\\\. These and the spillway were all complete by August 31, and the main embankment was finished by September 11\\\\. On September 18, the final concrete placement occurred, and on September 20, 1953, the dam was completed under the primary contract, 251 days ahead of schedule. Dam and reservoir The Jamestown Dam is long at the crest and above the streambed of the James River. Measured from the deepest point of excavation to the crest, the height is . Its maximum thickness is from upstream toe to downstream toe. The dam embankment contains of material, primarily dirt, rock, gravel and riprap. The dam's typical release rate is . The outlet works are controlled by four identical high-pressure gates, 5 feet by 6 feet (1.5 by 1.8 m) in size. Two are for normal use and two are for emergency releases. The maximum capacity of the outlet works is per second, or per second per gate. The dam also has an emergency inverted-bell spillway, capable of handling per second. The total release capacity of the dam is per second. The outlet works are designed to allow for possible future installation of hydroelectric generators and future municipal water supply. The Jamestown Reservoir typically holds of water, with a normal surface area of . Its maximum capacity is and maximum surface area is over . =Flood control= James River watershed The Jamestown Dam's primary purpose is flood control, and has prevented approximately $36 million in flood-related damages. When it was constructed, certain deficiencies were noted in the foundations for the dam. When the reservoir is at normal levels, the failure risk is small, but as the water level rises, the potential for collapse increases. Floods in May 1969 caused the reservoir to rise to its record level, over , causing leakage of the dam. This level was not even half the reservoir's maximum capacity of . In 1993 and 1995, floods caused the lake to rise to within of the 1969 level. An inspection by the Bureau of Reclamation's Dam Safety Department revealed that the dam could potentially fail if the deficiencies were not corrected. As a result, eight relief wells (wells that drain a pervious stratum) were installed in the dam in 1995, and a heavy gravel filter blanket to prevent erosion of embankment materials during seepage was constructed in the spring of 1996. =Recreation= Besides flood control, the long, Jamestown Reservoir was also created for the secondary purpose of recreation, which mainly involves camping, boating, fishing, and birding managed by the Stutsman County Park Board. The lake has approximately of shoreline and is referred to as \\"one of the greatest migratory waterfowl flyways in North Dakota.\\" It is stocked with fish by the North Dakota Game and Fish Department. Common fish species in the reservoir include pike, walleye, crappie, bluegill, smallmouth bass, muskie and bullhead.

He saw his neighbour, an ethnic Bosniak, being harassed by a group of VRS soldiers, whom he then tried to stop; the soldiers turned to Aleksiƒá, beating him with their rifle butts until he fell into a coma. He died a week later at the hospital. He has received several posthumous awards for his act, viewed of as deeply heroic in a time of bloody war. A documentary about his life, Srƒëo, was made by RTS in 2007. Early life Aleksiƒá was born in the municipality of Trebinje, then part of SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia. His father Rade was a basketball coach, and his mother Mira, from Prijedor, died at an early age. His brother died in a hang glider accident, above the Petrovo field, near Trebinje. Aleksiƒá received several awards as an amateur actor, and continued to act during the War in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including in a play San ratne noƒái (\\"War night's dream\\"). He was also a prospective swimmer for Yugoslavia. During the Bosnian War, he was recruited into the Army of Republika Srpska (the Bosnian Serb Army). Heroic act and death On January 21, 1993, a group of four uniformed VRS soldiers forced Alen Glavoviƒá, an ethnic Bosniak, out of a caf√© by the Freedom Square across the street from the police station, and started harassing and beating him. Glavoviƒá was the neighbour of Aleksiƒá; he intervened and went towards them and shouted for them to stop, ending the attack. However, the four soldiers then turned against Aleksiƒá and beat him severely with their rifle butts, leaving him falling into coma. Due to the incurred injuries, he died in the hospital on January 27, 1993. Srƒëan's father wrote in his obituary that \\"Srƒëan died carrying out his human duty\\" (\\"Umro je vr≈°eƒái svoju ljudsku du≈ænost\\"). One of the attackers was killed during the war, whilst the other three were each sentenced to 28 months in prison. One of the defence lawyers of the attackers said while in court, \\"Served him right, defending a balija\\", the latter being a derogatory term for Bosnian Muslims. Alen Glavoviƒá, the friend that Srƒëan saved, survived and fled the war and today lives in Sweden, married with two children. Every year he visits Srƒëan's grave and Srƒëan's father with his family. Alen has said that it is his human and moral duty to visit his grave. Legacy In 2007 Radio Television of Serbia recorded and broadcast a documentary on Srƒëan Aleksiƒá, named \\"SRƒêO\\" (hypocoristic form of Srƒëan). The Trebinje theatre Slovo, which Aleksiƒá himself had been member of, performed a memorial play, Epilog, about his life. In 2011, filming began for the movie Circles (Krugovi), which was inspired by the heroic act of Srƒëan Aleksiƒá and directed by Srƒëan Goluboviƒá. The Republic of Serbia awarded him the Golden Medal of Milo≈° Obiliƒá in 2012. Srƒëan Aleksiƒá was posthumously granted a Charter of the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is an initiative in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Republika Srpska to officially honour him.B92, \\"BiH i RS da odlikuju Aleksiƒáa\\", 3.03.2012 After his death, there has still not been any recognition of him in his home town. The local government of Trebinje still consider how to honor him in the right way, whether in form of a monument or a fountain (as of 2012). The former \\"Street of Great Trees\\" (ulica velikih drveta) in the Novi Grad municipality of Sarajevo was renamed after him, 15 years after his death, with the municipality saying \\"Without people like Srƒëan Aleksiƒá and his heroic deeds, one would lose hope in humanity, and without it our life would have no meaning\\". A pass is named after him in Zmaj-Jovo's street in Novi Sad, which includes a memorial plaque, and a pass also bears his name in Panƒçevo. On July 11, 2013 the Srdjan Aleksic Boulevard was opened near Pobre≈æje Park in Podgorica, Montenegro, a park dedicated to the civilian casualties of the Yugoslav Wars. A street in New Belgrade, Serbia was named after Srƒëan Aleksiƒá in early 2016.Belgrade Honours Bravery of Serb Who Saved Bosniak, Balkan Insight 27 Jan 16 In 2013, the Post-Conflict Research Center, a Sarajevo-based NGO, launched its own Srƒëan Aleksiƒá Youth Competition.

It was designed by Department of Public Works (Queensland) and built in 1897 by Murray and Litster. It is also known as Cloncurry Court House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.  History  The present Cloncurry Court House is the second on site and was erected in stages between 1897 and 1961. The Cloncurry district was subject to pastoral settlement from the mid-1860s. Access to artesian water from the 1890s enabled the grazing of sheep and cattle to succeed despite severe drought and in what is essentially a semi-arid environment. Mining also proved a significant activity in the district, although a less stable one than pastoralism. Gold was first discovered in the area in 1867, and from the late 1860s through the last three decades of the 19th century, gold was found and mined throughout the district, although as a series of short lived fields. In 1867 Ernest Henry, often referred to as \\"the father of Cloncurry\\", discovered copper in the area, not far from the present town of Cloncurry, although the boom era for copper mining was not reached until the early twentieth century. The township of Cloncurry was established in the early 1870s to serve a remote and isolated area in the far north west of Queensland. It was officially declared a Country Post Office in 1871, and in 1872 a general store and a hotel were opened. Early transportation was by horse, bullock and camel teams, and later by Cobb & Co coaches. The Great Northern railway line to the east coast was not extended to Cloncurry until December 1908. Cloncurry prospered in the 1880s, when prices for pastoral produce remained buoyant and mining activity increased. A police contingent of 4 men and an Inspector had been stationed in tents at Cloncurry from 1870, but it was not until 1880 that a permanent Clerk of Petty Sessions was appointed, and Cloncurry's first Police Magistrate was appointed in 1882. At that time there were still no permanent police quarters, and the lock-up was a slab hut with a bark roof. In 1883 the Department of Public Works called tenders for a timber building to serve as a Court house, police quarters and lockup. This was completed in 1885, and the first Court sat in March 1900. From 1907 this building was used for police purposes only and was demolished in 1965. The administration of justice was brought to sparsely settled and isolated areas by means of small court houses combined with, or attached to, police stations and served by visiting magistrates. Cloncurry was designated a District Court Area in 1889, but almost a decade passed before a new court house was completed in July 1898 by Murray and Litster at a cost of . This court house was a rectangular, two-roomed, timber- framed structure with exposed studwork and a wide verandah to all four sides. In the first two decades of the 20th century, Cloncurry prospered with the boom in copper prices and the corresponding increase in copper mining activity in the district. In 1906 Cloncurry became a Circuit Court centre. In 1907 the size of the court complex was more than doubled with the addition of a new court room and offices for the judge, barristers, court warden and jurors. The existing court was shifted slightly to adjoin the new section and became offices for the Clerk of Petty Sessions and for the government surveyor. This addition gave the building a new elevation to Sheaffe Street. In 1914 further alterations were made to provide for officers from other government departments, including the land commissioner, mining registrar and inspector of machinery. A new hip-roofed wing was constructed at the southern end of the building which contained two rooms and extended the western verandah. A separate, 2 roomed structure was linked to the rear verandah by a covered way and accommodated drafting and records. In 1953 a toilet block and strongroom was added and in 1961 the last major addition occurred when a four roomed wing was added to the 1914 section. This was built under the same roofline and continued the weatherboard cladding and existing window hood detail. The inspectorship of the police district was transferred from Cloncurry in 1963 as Mount Isa had developed to become the more important regional centre, however the court continues in use. In 1966 a new station, cells and quarters were constructed. Conservation work on the courthouse was undertaken in 1977 with state government funding. It continues to operate for its original purpose.  Description  Side view, 2013 Architectural plans for the extended court house, Cloncurry, 1907 The 1897 section is a rectangular, two-roomed, timber- framed structure with exposed studwork, a hipped corrugated iron roof, and a wide verandah to four sides, sections of which have been enclosed. Off the rear (eastern) verandah of the 1898 section is a hip-roofed 1953 block containing toilets and a strongroom. The walls, ceiling and floor of the strongroom are constructed of reinforced concrete; the remainder of the building is constructed of timber. Attached to the southwest corner of the 1898 section is the 1907 addition. This comprises a T-shaped timber-framed building clad with weatherboard, with a verandah around 3 sides of the stem of the T (which contains the courtroom), and around the rear offices, permitting the verandah of the new building to link with that of the 1897 building. The entrance addresses Sheaffe Street, and is articulated by a gable roof to the verandah at this point. The roof of this section is also of galvanised corrugated iron. The 1907 courtroom has a coved ceiling of tongue-and-groove pine, and walls of vertical boarding. Off the southeast corner of the 1907 section, at the rear, is a long hip-roofed wing constructed in two stages: 2 rooms in 1914 and 4 in 1961. Both sections are timber-framed with weatherboard cladding and have the same window hood detail over exposed windows and doors. Both open onto a north-facing verandah, joined to the 1907 section. There is a two-roomed timber pavilion linked to the rear (eastern) verandah of the 1907 section by what was originally a long covered way, which is now completely joined to the eastern verandah. This section is timber-framed with horizontal weatherboard cladding and sunshades over exposed windows and doors. There are 4 toilets, added in later stages, to the south of the covered way. Apart from the strongroom, all sections of this building are raised on low concrete stumps.  Heritage listing  Cloncurry Court House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Cloncurry Court House is important in illustrating the development of Cloncurry and district, reflecting the importance of Cloncurry as a regional and administrative centre in the late 19th and early 20th century. This court house and the site on which it is located have been associated with the administration of justice in the region since the mid-1880s. The additions and adaptations also reflect the way in which provision has been made for increasing services to match the needs of the area with regard to mining and pastoralism. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Cloncurry Court house is a good example of a building serving a number of important governmental functions and extended over time while adhering to the original design principles. It provides a demonstration of building techniques within the traditional style between 1897 and 1961. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The Cloncurry Court House has had a long connection with the people of Cloncurry and the surrounding district as the focus for a range of important government services.

According to Malcolm Gladwell in his 2008 book Outliers, \\"The runaway would be beaten, and salt pickle, lime juice, and bird pepper would be rubbed into his or her open wounds. Another slave would defecate into the mouth of the miscreant, who would then be gagged for four to five hours.\\" The punishment was invented by Thomas Thistlewood, a slave overseer, and named for the slave, Derby, who was made to undergo this punishment when he was caught eating young sugar cane stalks in the field on 25 May 1756. However, historian Douglas Hall points out that \\"Derby's dose\\" was so-called because it was often administered by one of his slaves called Derby.Douglas Hall, In Miserable Slavery: Thomas Thistlewood in Jamaica, 1750-86, Macmillan, 1999, p. 73. Thistlewood recorded this punishment as well as a further punishment of Derby in August of that same year in his diary.

The HEMTT is an eight-wheel drive, diesel-powered, tactical truck used by the US military and others. The HEMTT is manufactured by Oshkosh Defense and entered Army service in 1982, with the M1120 variant first produced in 1999. History Following the evaluation of proposals submitted by AM General, MAN, Pacific Car & Foundry (PACCAR) and Oshkosh Truck Corporation, In May 1981, the then U.S. Army Tank Automotive Command awarded an initial five-year contract valued at US$251.13 million to Oshkosh Truck Corporation for production of the 10 ton (9,070 kg) 8 x 8 Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Truck (HEMTT). The M1120 LHS variant was initially introduced as part of the HEMTT overhaul/rebuild programme, during which returned M977 Cargo variants have their cargo bodies and materials handling cranes removed, to be replaced by a Multilift Mark 5 (now designated MPH165-LHS) load handling system, as fitted to the Oshkosh PLS truck. Other modifications include an upgrade of the rear suspension. The first rebuilt M1120 was produced in late-1999, with new build M1120A2 examples (now A4) available from February 2004. By mid 2019 Oshkosh had manufactured (new build) 35,000 HEMTTs of all types. Specific figures for the M1120 LHS variant are not available. For reference, original HEMTT models now have the suffix A0. Only the M984 wrecker was produced in A1 configuration. All models were produced in A2 configuration. The A3 suffix is applied to HEMTT technology demonstrators with a diesel-electric drive system. All current HEMTT production models have the suffix A4.  Description  The HEMTT was developed from the outset as a tactical truck, but to minimize procurement and life cycle costs included militarized commercial automotive components where possible, these including the engine and transmission. Some components used in early HEMTTs are common with the Oshkosh Logistics Vehicle System (LVS) vehicles which were supplied to the U.S. Marine Corps. The chassis of the M1120 is formed of 257 √ó 89 √ó 9.5 mm heat-treated carbon manganese steel with a yield strength of 758 MPa. With the exception of the wrecker variant, this chassis is common on all HEMTT variants Bolted construction with Grade 8 bolts is used throughout. A centrally mounted self- recovery winch is an option and this is fitted to around 20% of production. The two-door forward control cab seats two. It is of heavy-duty welded steel construction with corrosion-resistant sheet metal skins. Add-on armor kits were produced by Simula Inc. and BAE Systems. The current HEMTT A4 is fitted with the slightly larger from the Oshkosh PLS A1. This cab complies with the U.S. Army's Long Term Armor Strategy (LTAS) requirements of an A- and B-kit armoring philosophy. It also comes as standard with integrated floor armor, an integrated mount for a machine gun and gunner protection kit, and air- conditioning. A Detroit Diesel 8V92TA V-8 two-stroke DDECIV diesel developing 445 hp is fitted to A2 HEMTTs. An EPA 2004 compliant Caterpillar (CAT) C-15 six-cylinder, 15.2-liter diesel developing a peak of 515 hp is fitted to HEMTT A4 models. HEMTT A2 models have an Allison HD 4560P 6F/1R automatic transmission coupled to an Oshkosh 5500 series 2-speed transfer case, while A4 varinats are fitted with an Allison 4500SP 5F/1R automatic transmission and an uprated version of the 55,000 series two-speed transfer case. The front axles on all HEMTTs are single-reduction Oshkosh 46K, the rear are Dana DS480 single-reduction. Drive to the front axles is selectable and all axles have differential locks. Suspension on the A2 variant is by Hendrickson RT40 leaf springs with equalizing beams. Suspension on A4 models is Holland air suspension, ADS-240 (front) and AD-246 (rear). Tire size is 1600 R20 on all models, and standard tire fit is Michelin XZL. All M1120 variants are capable of fording water crossings up to 48 inches deep, and can climb a gradient of at least 60%. All M1120 variants are air transportable in the C-130 and C-17 transport aircraft. The M1120 HEMTT LHS is fitted with Multilift Mark 5 (now designated MPH165-PLS) load handling system, this an imperial variant of the Mark 4/MPH165 that is further-modified to include a folding hook arm to bring the system within C-130 Hercules air-transport height constraints. The MPH165-PLS system is produced under licence by Oshkosh and is also fitted to the M1074 and M1075 PLS and Logistic Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR). The MKVI LHS (now designated MPH165-CBT) is a further development of the MPH165-PLS and has additional fixings and hydraulic couplings for the Bridge Adapter Pallet (BAP). This is fitted to the M1977 Common Bridge Transporter (CBT) variant of the HEMTT. The Multilift MPH (Military Pivoting Hooklift) range is based around commercially proven technologies, the overall system performance being improved by enhancing below ground pick up and the ability to load misaligned flatracks, both important military operational requirements. The complete system is designed to be used in all operational conditions, including darkness or while wearing nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) protective equipment. An automatic, fully sequenced control system mounted in the cab aids operational safety and maximises speed, even under battle conditions. The MPH range was designed and optimised to load, transport and unload flatracks conforming to the NATO standard (STANAG 2413). Flatracks can be pre-loaded at base with any military payload ready for dispersal to the required location. Payloads such as MLRS rockets, light armoured vehicles and command/control shelters can also be transported by using purpose-built flatracks with the correct locking systems built in. In U.S. Army service the M1120 can be equipped with several different styles of flatracks for the load handling system. The M1077 and M1077A1 General Purpose A-frame flatracks are sideless flatracks used to transport pallets of ammunition and other classes of supplies. M1077 flatracks are 6.058 m long, 2.438 m wide, and 1.5915 m high over the A-frame. On the ISO-compatible Palletized Flatrack (IPF) Type M1 there are two end walls, one incorporating the A-frame. Both walls can fold down inwardly for stacking when empty. The dimensions of the IPF are the same as for the M1077, apart from the end walls that have a height of 2.083 m. The M3/M3A1 Container Roll-in/Out Platform (CROP) is a flatrack that fits inside a 20 ft. ISO container. The Container Handling Unit (CHU) is an add-on kit that allows for the loading/unloading and transport of standard ISO containers without the need for an intermediate flatrack. The SOFRAME RM 22 PLM load handling trailer which was originally selected as the M1076 trailer component of the US Army's PLS is compatible with, and used with, the M1120 HEMTT. The RM 22/M1076 is a three-axle dolly- type trailer. It uses a mainframe assembled using electric welding, with a secondary frame supporting the front axle on a turning table and the drawbar; a steering lock allows the steering to be fixed when required. Two axles are provided at the rear and braking is on all three axles. Flatracks can be on- and off-loaded from the trailer by the prime mover's load handling system. M1977 HEMTT Common Bridge Transporter (CBT) The M1977 HEMTT Common Bridge Transporter (CBT) is a further development of the M1120 LHS, and in common with the M1120 LHS was initially introduced as part of the HEMTT overhaul/rebuild program. It is used for loading, transporting, and unloading Ribbon Bridge components and bridge erection boats.

Diplomatic relations have never been established between the two entities, but Vietnam is the only communist state in Asia to have unofficial and bilateral relations with the Vatican. History While two countries only exist unofficial relations and dialogue, historical presence of Christianity in Vietnam has a relatively long history. The first Catholic missionary to Vietnam started at the 15th century, but became only more frequent in the 16th century with the arrival of French, Polish and Portuguese Jesuits. The Polish Jesuit, Wojciech Mƒôci≈Ñski, was the first ever Catholic to record the existence of Vietnam and Vietnamese culture.http://misjejezuici.blogspot.com/2012/07/wojciech-mecinski.html Catholic missions in Vietnam continued uninterrupted, but the most influential to make impact on the rise of Christian Church was Frenchman Alexandre de Rhodes. Father Alexandre had helped spreading Christianity, especially Catholicism in Vietnam; but the most was the creation of Vietnamese alphabet, called \\"Qu·ªëc Ng·ªØ\\", which would be used in Vietnam since the 20th century.https://saigoneer.com/saigon-people/9498-street-cred-alexandre-de- rhodes-and-the-birth-of-ch%E1%BB%AF-qu%E1%BB%91c-ng%E1%BB%AF Under the era of the North's Tr·ªãnh lords and the South's Nguy·ªÖn lords, Christianity was viewed with skepticism in both, though the Tr·ªãnh lords were more hostile than its southern rival and had expelled Christians from the country.http://vietnam.jannalongacre.com/religion/christainity/http://www.vjol.info/index.php/RSREV/article/viewFile/9468/8779 The Nguy·ªÖn lords, while not too opening either, seen to be more Christian- friendly than the Tr·ªãnh lords and Christianity became more widespread, resulted with the larger Christian population in the south than the north today.https://sites.google.com/site/vietnamesemartyrs/history/vietnamese- catholics The T√¢y S∆°n dynasty, founded after reunited Vietnam, began a level of persecution, though became even more serious under Emperor C·∫£nh Th·ªãnh, who issued massacre on Christians.https://nhatbook.com/2017/01/23/the-tay-son- uprising/ Under the circumstance of oppression, Christians sought refuge in La Vang, where they reported about the Marian apparition in the same place, known today as Our Lady of La Vang.https://catholicpilgrimagenetwork.com/the-story- of-our-lady-of-lavang/ Pope John Paul II had acknowledged the importance of La Vang and expressed desire to rebuild the Catholic Church, ruined during the Vietnam War.https://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul- ii/en/letters/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19990716_madonna-la-vang.html With the ascend of Emperor Gia Long, who founded the Nguy·ªÖn dynasty, Christianity in Vietnam witnessed a resurgence. Gia Long had a long standing friendly toward Christians, owning by the debt from Pigneau de B√©haine, a French Bishop who helped organize the anti-T√¢y S∆°n force to finally retake Vietnam from the opponent.https://books.google.com/books?id=Bl04DgAAQBAJ&pg;=PT37&lpg;=PT37&dq;=tay+son+catholicism&source;=bl&ots;=5c5ul7JSv5&sig;=ACfU3U2_g1sWsLFHfk7Qf6LKl01H2uIfUg&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=2ahUKEwjIsrmwm_LhAhURn- AKHbLMCVIQ6AEwBXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q;=tay%20son%20catholicism&f;=false Emperor Gia Long's friendliness with Christians built up the stronger Christian influence in the country. However, after Gia Long's death, Emperor Minh M·∫°ng returned to traditional persecution of Christians, revoked many of his father's policies. The persecution only stopped when Cochinchina Campaign and French conquest forced Emperor T·ª± ƒê·ª©c to accept the presence of Christians. Before the independence of Vietnam there already existed, since 1925, an Apostolic Delegation (a non-diplomatic mission accredited to the Catholic Church in the area) for Indochina, based in Hanoi. After the expulsion of its staff by the North Vietnamese authorities, the headquarters of the Apostolic Delegation was moved to Saigon in 1957. In 1964, responsibility for relations with the Church in Laos was transferred to the Apostolic Delegation in Bangkok and the Saigon-based mission was renamed Apostolic Delegation for Vietnam and Cambodia. Cambodia and the Holy See established diplomatic relations in 1994 and the name of the Apostolic Delegation was again changed, this time to Apostolic Delegation for Vietnam. Meanwhile, with the end of the Vietnam War, the Apostolic Delegate was forced to leave. Since an apostolic delegation, unlike an embassy, is not a bilateral institution with involvement by the State, the Apostolic Delegation for Vietnam has not been suppressed, but has remained inactive since 1975.Filipazzi, Antonio G. Rappresentanze e Rappresentanti Pontifici dalla seconda met√† del XX secolo (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2006 ), p. X, XII, XV, 189) Temporary missions from the Holy See to discuss with the Government matters of common interest are sent every year or two, and there has been at least one visit to the Vatican by a Vietnamese mission. Present The Communist Party of Vietnam officially promoted atheism and somehow favored Mahayana Buddhism ‚Äî the major faith of Vietnamese people, causing Roman Catholics and other Christians to be associated with the anti-communist South Vietnam region. This has strained relations between the Holy See and the Hanoi Government. Leading bishops have been imprisoned for several years, in what some observers have described as a persecution of the Vietnamese Church. Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn T·∫•n D≈©ng and Pope Benedict XVI met at the Vatican on 25 January 2007 in a \\"new and important step towards establishing diplomatic ties\\". The first meeting of the Vietnam-Holy See Joint Working Group was convened in Hanoi from 16‚Äì17 February 2009. The Pope met with President Nguy·ªÖn Minh Tri·∫øt on 11 December 2009. Vatican officials called the meeting \\"a significant stage in the progress of bilateral relations with Vietnam.\\" The Vietnam-Holy See Joint Working Group met for a second time in June 2010. There is also a question of Church property confiscated by the Vietnamese government and that the Church has sought to recover. In January 2011 the Holy See appointed the first envoy, formally \\"non-resident representative to Vietnam\\" with Archbishop Leopoldo Girelli being the first to hold the post in addition to Archbishop Girelli's other roles as Apostolic Nuncio to Singapore and Apostolic Delegate to Malaysia. =Normalization process= There have been meetings between leaders of Vietnam and the Vatican, including a visit by Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn T·∫•n D≈©ng to the Vatican to meet Pope Benedict XVI on 25 January 2007. Official Vatican delegations have been traveling to Vietnam almost every year since 1990 for meetings with its government authorities and to visit Catholic dioceses. In March 2007, a Vatican delegation visited Vietnam and met with local officials. In October 2014, Pope Francis met with Prime Minister Nguy·ªÖn T·∫•n D≈©ng in Rome. The sides continued discussions about the possibility of establishing normal diplomatic relations, but have not provided a specific schedule for the exchange of ambassadors. The Pope would again meet Vietnamese leader Tr·∫ßn ƒê·∫°i Quang and his associates in the Vatican in 2016.https://vietnamnews.vn/politics-laws/346844/pope-francis-welcomes- vietnamese-leaders-visit-to-vatican.html#WJxfVvVjal0g1Vwd.97 Vietnam remains as the only Asian communist country to have an unofficial representative of the Vatican in the country and has held official to unofficial meetings with the Vatican's representatives both in Vietnam and Holy See, which it doesn't exist in China, North Korea and Laos, due to long and historical relations between Vietnam and the Catholic Church.https://vietnamnews.vn/politics- laws/468272/deputy-pm-truong-hoa-binh-meets-vatican- leaders.html#2cHUPVoYVZhmGcRJ.97 This has improved in a more favorable manner, when Holy See announced they will have a permanent representative in Vietnam in 2018.https://www.romereports.com/en/2018/12/20/holy-see-to-have-permanent- representative-in-vietnam/https://international.la-croix.com/news/vatican- vietnam-move-closer-to-full-diplomatic-relations/9128 Although it has yet to establish an official embassy and full ambassador, it was hailed as a major improvement. =Appointment of Archbishops= Though the Government of Vietnam remains a veto over the appointment of cardinals by the Vatican, the Communist regime of Vietnam, unlike those of other communist Asian states, has voluntarily cooperated with bishops that nominated by the Vatican. This was seen after the historic Vietnam‚ÄìHoly See deal in 2018, which the Vatican retains status of appointment of Archbishops with skeptical support from the Government, proved if they do not interference in the regime's politics.

BiographyThe Cypresses Believe in God The book is a novel in two parts, and is the first novel of four, written from a Roman Catholic viewpoint, by its Catholic author, who had been educated in a seminary ‚Äî but who attempted to approach the many nuances and subtleties among all the factions on the eve of war in a fair, even-handed manner. The story is set in Girona, a city in eastern Catalonia, and follows the life of a family, from 1931 until the Spanish Civil War breaks out in 1936. The protagonist is the son of an atheist from Madrid, who is married to a devout Basque woman, and has a younger brother and sister also caught up in the conflict. In a sequel to Cypresses, One Million Dead (Un mill√≥n de muertos), translated by Joan MacLean, Gironella follows the Alvear family through the war. The next novel is Peace after War, published in English in 1969, and was also translated by MacLean. The fourth novel, Los hombres lloran solos (Men cry alone), has not been translated into English. While Gironella hated the polarization that led to Civil War, he supported the Spanish Nationalists who rallied around Franco and himself joined the Carlist unit, Requet√©s (short for \\"Tercio de Requet√©s de la Madre de Dios de Montserrat\\"). In The New York Times Book Review, Gerald Brenan, an expert on Spanish literature, called the work absorbing and remarkably objective; yet many modern scholars have strongly objected to the errors, omissions and unforgivable modifications made by Gironella regarding the speech by the University of Salamanca's dean, philosopher Miguel de Unamuno, against the military rebels.Carlos Blanco Aguinaga, Julio Rodriguez Puertolas e Iris M. Zavala: Historia Social de la Literatura Espanola (en lengua castellana). Tomo III, Castalia, Madrid, 1979, pp. 105-106.

It stars Courtney Clonch and Bruce Boxleitner. The film is a B movie based on Mummy legends, and was released in between two similar, more-successful films: The Mummy Returns (2001) and The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008). Plot Two young men speed through the California desert on dirt bikes when one of them crashes through a hole in the ground. They discover the entrance to an Egyptian tomb and are both killed in boobytraps when they break the tomb‚Äôs seal. Some time later, the site is being uncovered by archeology students led by Dr. Ari Ben-David. Molly Kirnan, a grad student, arrives on the scene and meets Ben-David who‚Äôs working with her professor Dr. Bryan Swatek among others as they start their excavation of the site. Inside the tomb they discover the sarcophagus of Aneh-Tet, a mythical priestess who worshiped Set and was banished ‚Äúacross the great water‚Äù for claiming to be a living god. In her burial chamber, the sarcophagus is surrounded by six other mummies with crystals in their chests. Later that night, Molly returns to the site alone having had a translating epiphany while reading and inadvertently read Aneh-Tet back to life. Before the mummy reanimates however, a security officer finds Molly and turns her over to Dr. Swatek. When she refuses his advances she leaves the site. Aneh-Tet then rises and leaves the tomb, draining the life from Swatek and the security guard. Inside the tomb, two of the six mummies surrounding Aneh-Tet‚Äôs sarcophagus have the crystals in their chest lit up. The next day, as the students arrive, and discover Swatek and the security guard‚Äôs mummified bodies while Molly waits for her sister Kevyn to bring her a change of clothes at her motel. When Kevyn arrives, they encounter a nude Aneh-Tet and Molly is able to communicate with her, bringing her back to the dig site with her. At the tomb, Aneh-Tet is recognized by Ben- David who pledges his servitude to her if she spares his life and she claims a third victim (a police deputy). Molly has to go take care of Kevyn at the motel because she is partying with several of the other students from the dog. While she does this, Aneh-Tet kills two more victims (Axel and ) lighting up five of the six mummies in her tomb. She tries to attack Carter but he is able to escape to the motel with Molly. Instead, Aneh-Tet kills Justin while Ben- David kills Kara will a pickaxe for seeing too much. Together, Aneh-Tet and Ben-David resurrect her legion of six mummies and commands them to bring her ‚Äúthe Offering‚Äù. The mummies descend upon the motel killing several patrons including the motel manager, being capable of reaching directly into peoples bodies and pulling out their organs. Molly and Carter are unable to find Kevyn and they realize the mummies have taken her as a virgin is needed for a final sacrifice so Aneh-Tet can begin world domination. Carter and Molly arrive at the tomb where they find Kevyn being prepped for sacrifice. Molly has armed herself with several sticks of dynamite (it‚Äôs not revealed where she got the dynamite) and threatens Aneh-Tet with it allowing Kevyn to escape. Ben-David attacks Carter but is killed with a relic battle axe from the tomb. Several mummies chase after Kevyn as Sheriff Jones and acting deputy Sam arrive at the dig site, having found the bodies at the motel. Aneh-Tet instead uses Carter as a sacrifice, finding that he is a virgin and stabs him. The mummies attack the Sheriff‚Äôs vehicle, killing him and Sam. Molly uses the sacrificial knife to stab Aneh-Tet before her ritual is complete causing her to return to her mummified state and her legion of undead to disintegrate. With Carter dead, Kevyn offers her virginal blood to Molly so they can bring Carter back to life with the ritual, which works and the credits roll.

The review makes note that the original title of the film was Unravelled which the reviewer argues is a much more fitting title for the misleading \\"zombie movie-sounding\\" Legion of the Dead and also points out the Egyptian mummy cover art inexplicably borrowed from Ancient Evil 2: Guardian of the Underworld. It states the film is even more misleading by giving the stars Bruce Boxleitner and Zach Galligan roles \\"so inconsequential to the plot that if they‚Äôd been dropped altogether it would have had very little impact on the rest of the film\\". The review goes on to say that while the film is not the worst, it brings nothing new to the genre of mummy-horror movies and ends up feeling predictable. FilmThreat.com gave the film a mostly negative review and did not recommend it to viewers. The review points out the many similarities between 1999‚Äôs The Mummy and the plot of this film, also arguing that the movie does nothing original with the plot. The review makes mention that the DVD cover art lists that it \\"stars\\" Bruce Boxleitner and Zach Galligan, yet the two share barely 10 minutes of total screen time combined. It concludes by saying the film is ultimately \\"a badly diluted, horribly concluded, low budget version of a fairly decent movie\\".

As of 2009, at its core there are several NGOs and academic institutions, dozens of rural cooperatives and associations, and hundreds of self-conscious participants (including academics, social workers, student volunteers, and grassroots activists). More broadly, the ideas and spirit of NRR have influenced a growing movement of rural experimentation, including many activists who do not use the term \\"NRR\\".New  Background  The initiators and theorists of NRR, sometimes known as the \\"New Rural Reconstruction school\\" (), felt that the reforms begun by Deng Xiaoping and other CCP leaders in the late 1970s were no longer benefiting rural communities, especially in central and western China, and in some ways hurting them. While most of the NRR school rarely use the term \\"New Left\\" to describe themselves, they are generally considered to be an important part of that critical tradition. Like the Chinese New Left in general, the NRR school is critical of the dominant current of utopian marketization, in which the market is seen as a solution to all problems. Instead, NRR supports the creation of rural cooperatives and other forms of cooperative social organization.Day (2008), Day and Hale (2007). NRR grew out of a loosely parallel set of academics, students, state development workers, and grassroots activists. In the early 1990s, a debate grew up over neo-liberal policies, such as those advocated by the World Bank. These critics charged that the success of free market and globalization policies in the short term threatened the long term viability of China's farm families and villages by eroding the remnants of the Mao-era communes, which had provided health, education, and welfare, leaving individual families to fend for themselves in these areas. In addition, urban expansion drove up land prices and local officials confiscated land in order to build factories and housing for the newly affluent. By the middle of the 1990s, in addition to demonstrations against traditional targets such as taxes, there were widespread protests against the corruption of local officials, pollution from the factories (many of which were owned by outside interests), and the gap between the newly rich and the still poor rural areas.Dale Wen (2005). In the late 1980s, Wen Tiejun (then state development worker, now dean of the School of Agricultural Economics and Rural Development at Renmin University) began to theorize and popularize the phrase \\"sannong wenti\\" (three rural problems), that is, nongmin (rural people or peasants), nongcun (rural society or villages), and nongye (rural production or agriculture). According to Wen's theory, Mao-era policies such as economic independence from the world capitalist system had been necessary for China to industrialize, but these policies had left the rural population in a weak position. The breakup of the commune system had produced individual plots too small to use technology efficiently and farmers were now at the mercy of market forces and an economic policy which favored exports and the cities over the countryside. To solve these contradictions, further market reforms were not the right strategy. Rural life had to be reconstructed.Wen Tiejun (2001), Dale Wen (2005). Wen Tiejun's influential essay \\"Deconstructing Modernization\\" challenged the West's industry-based modernization as an \\"unreproducible experiment\\". The West, charged Wen, financed its development with capital from colonies and by controlling global resources, a strategy which was not open to China. Wen's research and travels in developing countries convinced him that China was not alone in facing \\"three disparities\\", that is, in rich vs. poor, city vs. countryside, and region vs. region. Wen hoped China's \\"people-centered scientific approach\\" and sustainable development would replace the earlier \\"vulgar growth\\" and \\"blind advocacy of consumerism\\".Wen Tiejun (2007). Although NRR is mainly conceived as a distinctively Chinese response to the problems of modernization under particular historical conditions, experiences outside of China have also influenced NRR. Negatively, the NRR school aims to avoid the social problems many developing countries have faced due to market- centered development and rapid urbanization ‚Äì especially rural landlessness, the formation of large sub-proletarian slums, and social unrest. Positively, some members of the NRR school looks to positive lessons from other developing countries that have mitigated these trends through various \\"alternative development\\" experiences. Most commonly discussed of these lessons is that of Kerala, India (see the Kerala model). Mainland Chinese NRR advocates learned about Kerala and other foreign experiences mainly through the introduction of Hong Kong scholars and activists, especially Lau Kin Chi and ARENA (Asian Regional Exchange for New Alternatives). In 2001, Lau arranged for Wen Tiejun and other mainland activists to visit the People's Science Movement in Kerala. This movement, they found, took inspiration not only from Gandhi but also from Mao Zedong. Kerala's high life expectancy, literacy, and social equality came not only from party politics and government policies, but also from such popular movements and the mobilization of many trained organizers working from the bottom up and organizing on a community level.Hale (2008).  History  Around 2002, some Chinese advocates of rural cooperative experimentation began adopting the term \\"Rural Reconstruction\\" from China's 1920s‚Äì1930s Rural Reconstruction Movement. The term \\"NRR\\" was first publicly used in January 2003, when CSER (China Society of Economic Reform, the think-tank/ publishing house where Wen Tiejun was based at the time) sponsored a national workshop on NRR in Beijing, attended by dozens of grassroots activists as well as supporters from Hong Kong. In July 2003, grassroots activist Qiu Jiansheng founded the James Yen Institute for Rural Reconstruction near the site of James Yen's 1930s Rural Reconstruction center in Dingzhou, along with the support of the local government, CSER, and Lau Kin Chi's China Social Services and Development Research Centre. This became one of two national centers for NRR activities ‚Äì mainly training student volunteers and grassroots activists on how to set up, run and support projects such as cooperatives ‚Äì until it closed in 2007. In 2004 the other, still active national center ‚Äì the Liang Shuming Center for Rural Reconstruction ‚Äì was founded in Beijing by grassroots activist Liu Xiangbo, also with the support of Wen Tiejun. After Wen left CSER and founded the Rural Reconstruction Center at Renmin University in 2005, the latter replaced CSER as an important institutional and economic base for the Liang Shuming Center and other NRR organizations and activities, such as the Guoren Green Alliance (a marketing network for environmentally-friendly farming cooperatives) and the Little Donkey Farm (one of China's first experiments with community supported agriculture). Other academic institutions, such as the Center for Rural Governance Studies at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, and other NGOs and networks, such as the Guizhou Association for Community Building and Rural Governance, identify with NRR, although some emphasize their differences from the current of NRR centered on Wen Tiejun and the Liang Shuming Center. Others, and an uncertain but certainly large number of grassroots experiments, have been influenced by NRR without using this term. To complicate matters, since the Chinese government began promoting the policy of \\"Constructing a New Socialist Countryside\\" (NSC, ) in 2006, many NRR advocates made a subtle switch to the state's term \\"NSC\\" instead of \\"NRR\\", presenting their views and experiments as \\"peasant-centered\\" or \\"village-community-centered\\" approaches to NSC. (While this new CCP policy is influenced in part by NRR, it should be primarily understood as an attempt to build the conditions for developing the rural consumer market.)Day (2008), He Xuefeng (2007), Wang Ximing (2009), Day and Hale (2009).  Present situation  After 2006, therefore, it became more difficult to identify a coherent NRR current or movement because, (1) the original NRR advocates generally stopped using the term, (2) some NRR advocates emphasized their differences from other NRR advocates, and (3) many more activists and experiments were (and continue to be) influenced by one or another strand of NRR without using or even necessarily knowing this term. In order to avoid the political sensitiveness of social movement, the NRR advocates started to call themselves a \\"network\\" () instead of a \\"movement\\" (). Yet, the NRR has been leading various initiatives in sustainable agriculture and alternative food networks such as community-supported agriculture have become a key instrument for the NRR to promote their ideas and philosophy.Si, Zhenzhong and Scott, Steffanie (2016). The convergence of alternative food networks within \\"rural development\\" initiatives: the case of the New Rural Reconstruction Movement in China Local Environment, 21(9): 1082‚Äì1099.Scott, Steffanie; Si, Zhenzhong; Schumilas, Theresa and Chen, Aijuan. (2018). Organic Food and Farming in China: Top-down and Bottom-up Ecological Initiatives New York: Routledge In the words of Wen Tiejun, NRR has \\"gone to the grassroots\\". The popular movements emerging from NRR are still in the process of formation and have yet to be documented.Hale (2010).

Malone's career as a recording artist spanned 77 years and, according to his biographer George King, is recognized as the longest by the Guinness World Records.King, George (2007). Kasper 'Stranger' Malone, A Brief Biography. George King and Associates. Retrieved 2010-05-26. His first recording, eight 78 rpm sides, was made by Columbia Records in 1926; his last one, with the Little Country Giants on their debut album Breaking Hearts and Living Free, in 2005. Malone was one of the first documented clarinet players in country music. Recording career Malone was born on a farm near Paducah, Kentucky and christened as Kanoy. Later, when he obtained a birth certificate, he preferred to change his first name to Kasper. He started playing the cornet the age of three. At the age of fifteen he left home, and joined a band of traveling musicians playing in silent movie theaters in Georgia. He learned the trade of playing clarinet and in 1926 joined Gid Tanner and His Skillet-Lickers. In the same year Clayton McMichen and Malone left Tanner and set up The Melody Men. On November 4, 1926 they made their recording debut, Let Me Call You Sweetheart. The band continued recording twice a year, first on a mobile rig sent from New York City, and since 1928 at Columbia's permanent studio in Atlanta, Georgia. According to Malone himself, the nickname Stranger was inspired by a yell from the crowd: \\"Who in the world is that little stranger playing the hell out of that saxophone?\\". In 1929 Malone left Georgia for St. Louis, Missouri and joined Schnitz Seymour's Miniature Circus.His brother lived in St. Louis - King. The band was soon dissolved. Malone formed his own band in Kansas, then joined Jim Story Band in Nebraska. In 1931 he played clarinet, flute and double bass for the WNAX orchestra in Yankton, South Dakota and hosted his own radio show. For the next decade he continued travelling all over the country, including a tour with the SS Coolidge cruise liner in 1934. During World War II he performed with Phil Harris for the USS Maritime Service Band. In 1953 Malone joined Jack Teagarden's All Stars and toured with this band for three years playing double bass and flute. After leaving Teagarden Malone briefly played in Las Vegas and then accepted an offer from the University of Arizona to join their staff and play principal bass at the Tucson Symphony Orchestra. He taught at the university for thirteen years and also played with the Denver Symphony and the San Francisco Symphony. In 1973 he moved to Germany and settled there for twenty years, living by private music lessons. In 1993 he returned to the United States and, after a series of setbacks, found a job with the Rome Symphony Orchestra and moved to Rome, Georgia.According to King, Malone by this time had to rely on public transportation, which limited his choices of the living environment. He settled in the center of the town one block from the former movie theater where he had played in 1925. He continued playing, performing more than 100 times in 2004.Walburn, Lee (2005, July).

Reception  Scott Yanow, writing for Allmusic, notes that \\"this is one of the great McCoy Tyner recordings. The powerful, percussive, and highly influential pianist sounds quite inspired throughout his appearance at the 1973 Montreux Jazz Festival\\". Richard Cook and Brian Morton, authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz, opine that Enlightenment and the 1974 live album Atlantis are \\"two huge, sprawling concert recordings which will drain most listeners: Tyner's piano outpourings seem unstoppable, and Lawrence comes on as an even fierier spirit than [Sonny] Fortune, even if both are in thrall to Coltrane. The Enlightenment set, cut at Montreux, is marginally superior, if only for the pile-driving 'Walk Spirit, Talk Spirit.\\" Steve Metaliz, writing for Down Beat, noted that: > since the death of Coltrane, it's been the pianists who've been on the > cutting edge of the music's development.... Enlightenment testifies to the > brilliant sound of [Tyner's] endeavors.

There have been tensions in the relationship in recent years due to criticism of the Algerian government by the Vatican and increasing restrictions imposed on Algerian Catholics.  Algerian independence  During the Algerian War of 1954-1962 the Holy See accepted the occupation of Algeria by France, and did not speak out in favor of Algerian independence despite pleas from the Algerian rebels to mediate. After Algeria became independent most of the French settlers left the country. However, Algeria generally retained close relationships with France, maintained diplomatic ties with the Holy See and allowed Roman Catholic priests to continue ministering to the remaining Catholics in Algeria. Official relationship Although Islam is the state religion of Algeria, the Holy See has maintained a comparatively good relationship with the Algerian authorities, with L√©on-√âtienne Duval being famously recognized as the bishop of Muslims after the departure of French colonists. The Algerian state has sought to clearly distinguish between the Catholic religion, which is licit in Algeria with limitations to proselytism, and between Evangelical sects, which are officially forbidden and legally repressed by state powers. However, since a 2006 law limited religious worship to government-approved buildings, more than a dozen Catholic churches have been closed, and several priests have been jailed under new provisions that call for a more strict application of Islamic law.  Recent events In 1996, seven Cistercian monks were killed by Islamist extremists, followed by the death of Roman Catholic bishop Pierre Claverie when a bomb exploded at his residence. Details of the deaths are still disputed by the Vatican. Concerned by mounting violence, the Vatican issued a harsh criticism of the government handling of the crisis in September 1997, saying that \\"for too long, the international community has looked on with detachment at the tragedy that is systematically bloodying\\" Algeria. On January 8, 1998, the Vatican's official daily newspaper called upon the international community to help bring an end to the \\"genocide\\" in Algeria. On the death of Pope John Paul II in April 2005, the president of Algeria Abdelaziz Bouteflika attended the funeral. Following remarks by Pope Benedict XVI in Regensberg on 12 September 2006 which were widely interpreted as being offensive to the Muslim religion, the Foreign Affairs minister asked the Vatican‚Äôs ambassador to provide explanations of these statements. The Algerian Association of Koranic Doctors called on Muslim countries to withdraw their ambassadors from Vatican City in protest. In March 2017 Pope Francis appointed White Fathers missionary Fr John MacWilliam as bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Laghouat, covering the largely Saharan inland of Algeria. The 68-year-old MacWilliaam had risen to the rank of major in the British army through 18 years of service, was ordained a priest in 1991, and joined the White Fathers after the assassination of four of its members in Tizi Ouzou, Algeria. He had become known for his efforts at building bridges with the Muslim community.

The first mention of Sianowo dates to 1348. In 1480, the church burned in a fire; however, The Madonna of Swionowo, a finely crafted statue, was saved. After the fire, the parish of Sianowo became a part of Strzepcz parish, although the church was later rebuilt. Around this time, the veneration of \\"The Mother of God\\" grew in popularity. Sources claim that, by the 15th century, a host of people were already making pilgrimages to Sianowo for blessings. Nineteenth century In 1810, for the second time, the church was destroyed by fire. The statue was once again saved and moved to Strzepcz. The parish priest of Strzepcz did not want to rebuild the Sianowo church. However, The Madonna was shown to a woman who prophesied that it was absolutely necessary to rebuild the church, and that doing otherwise would lead to bad luck. This testimony was given under oath in the presence of the priest. The church was then quickly rebuilt and the number of worshipers rapidly grew. In 1864, the Sianowo parish was installed for the second time. Sources from that time state that Many lame and crippled who come are cured because of the Madonna. The maimed left their crutches and sticks in Sianowo; young people who wished to be married willingly made pilgrimages; soldiers reporting to the battlefields of World War II sought blessings. It is believed that they repeatedly owed their miraculous rescue to Her. Twentieth century Franciszek Grucza (1911‚Äì1993), was an outstanding priest, and translated the Gospels into the Kashubian language. His and many other testimonies led Che≈Çmno Kazimierz Bishop J√≥zef Kowalski to address a request (1965) to Pope Paul VI to crown the miraculous statue as the Queen of the Kashubes. The Pope agreed to this request and the coronation occurred on September 4, 1966. Many bishops and a great number of Kashubians assembled. From this time, veneration further grew. In 1987, Pope John Paul II christened Sianowo as an important place for Kashubian religious worship. He told:http://w2.vatican.va/content/john-paul- ii/pl/homilies/1987/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_19870611_gente-mare.html\\"All of you, your families and your troubles I put to the feet of Christ's Mother, hallowed in many sanctuaries of this land, and especially in Sianowo ...\\".http://www.geo.uj.edu.pl/publikacje.php?id=000120&page;=peregrinus&nr;=00012007&brf;=summary The Pilgrims' Square, where approximately 20,000 people assemble every year to celebrate the July church festival, has been restored. For the festival, about 40 companies of pilgrims arrive on foot each year. Pilgrims from Miastko cover the longest route of 120 km. Pilgrims willingly emphasize their Kashubian roots, and several of them arrive in their traditional dresses. They carry props and banners bearing witness to their attachment to the Catholic faith and the Kashubian identity. At each church festival, a part of the liturgy is in the Kashubian language.  21st century  In 2016 Wilno church received a replica statue of Our Lady of Sianowo, Queen of Kaszebe from the Parish of Sianowo.http://www.thedailyobserver.ca/2016/08/04/queen-of-zaszebe-finds-home- in-wilno-church Sianowo/Swi√≥now√≤ See also *History of Pomerania *Jan Trepczyk *Aleksander Majkowski References External links  * *‚ÄûL√´dow√¥ N√≥ta\\" from Canada *Sanctuary * 2013 Category:Kashubian culture Category:Villages in Kartuzy County ","title":"Sianowo"},{"id":"21666084","text":"Sianowo Le≈õne (Cashubian Lesn√© Sj√≥now√≤),() is a settlement in the administrative district of Gmina Kartuzy, within Kartuzy County, Pomeranian Voivodeship, in northern Poland.

The Strawberry-Picking Festivalhttp://www.thedailyobserver.ca/2010/07/20/a-celebration-of-the- kashubian-culture is the big event in Kashubia, with visitor numbers in the tens of thousands, increasing every year. The fact that nearly two tonnes of strawberries were sold in a single day in 2005 also bears testimony to the popularity of this festival. The reputation of ‚Äòtruskawka kaszubska‚Äô or ‚Äòkasz√´bsk√¥ mal√´na‚Äô is confirmed by numerous articles and pieces of evidence demonstrating that the product has become part of the culture and identity of the inhabitants of Kashubia. The local press publishes information vital to strawberry growers and comments at length on their efforts to join forces and take a common stand on the ‚Äòtruskawka kaszubska‚Äô or ‚Äòkasz√´bsk√¥ mal√´na‚Äô, as well as to take action aimed at safeguarding the specific quality, smell and taste of these strawberries.

He composed music for 52 films (23 in Malayalam with 127 songs), and was the music conductor for more than 100 films. He is best known as the father of music composer A. R. Rahman. His debut song as a music director was \\"Chotta Muthal Chudala Vare\\" (\\"from cradle to grave\\"), which was a big hit in Kerala. This was composed for the film Pazhassi Raja (1964). Early life He was born to Rajagopala Bhagavathar, a harikatha exponent in Tamil Nadu. His entry into film music was opened through his extraordinary performances on harmonium for Theatre Plays. He started his career in the film industry as an assistant to music director M. B. Sreenivasan. Later on he conducted and arranged music for famous Malayalam Music directors M.K. Arjunan and V. Dakshinamoorthy. He was so fascinated by the tunes created by these legends, that he would work very hard single-handedly to create the BGM of the songs they tuned to match its purity and standard, thus making the songs evergreen on par. Their association lasted till his death. Career His career as an independent music composer started with the 1964 film Pazhassi Raja, of which the philosophical song \\"Chotta Muthal Chudala Vare\\" became a big hit. After his next work in Aisha, he turned back to arranging and conducting for other composers. After a gap of 7 years, he returned to music composing through the film Anaathashilpangal in 1971. He composed music for Taxi Car by P. Venu in 1972. Then he went on to compose music for about 20 films. Due to the failure of these films in the box office, his songs went unnoticed and he lacked to get more opportunities for composing. His close friend in the industry was composer M. K. Arjunan. Starting from Arjunan master's first film, Shekhar assisted him in all his films till his death. Continuous hard work made Shekhar's health condition worse. In all these days, Arjunan master was the caretaker of him and his family. He composed tunes for his last film Chottanikkara Amma when he was in bed for treatment and he died leaving the project incomplete. Later on, M.K. Arjunan completed the project by arranging and recording the songs that Shekhar composed. Personal life R. K. Shekhar was married to Kasthuri. Their marriage took place in the most prominent shrine in India, the Tirumala Venkateswara Temple located in Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh in Southern India. Shekhar and Kasthuri had four children, A. R.

History  The first building at the modern location of Nevsky, 18 was constructed at the beginning of the 18th century. It was a small wooden house owned by Cornelius Cruys - the Vice Admiral of the Imperial Russian Navy and the first commander of the Russian Baltic Fleet, close associate of Peter the Great. In 1738 the property passed to tailor Johann Neumann. He hired a famous architect Mikhail Zemtsov to build a new two story stone house. Neumann's house facade faced Moika, and the side to Nevsky Prospekt didn't even have windows. This shows that at the time, Nevsky didn't yet obtain its status of the main street in the Saint Petersburg. The house hosted the museum of wax figures - first in city, although it only existed for one year. Several boutiques operated in Neumann house. In 1743, German merchant Johann Albrecht was selling tableware made from serpentine stone, which supposedly rejected poison (considering the times, it was an attractive proposition). Frenchman Charpentier was selling powder, and Dutch merchant le- Roi had a shop \\"Rotterdam\\" selling chocolate, vanilla and ink. In 1807, merchant Konon Kotomin bought the land and the property. Kotomin raised to prosperity after being released from serfdom for prince Alexei Kurakin some twenty years earlier. Perhaps a coincidence, but Kotomin has chosen to live right next to prince Kurakin's residence at the time - Chicherin House - across Nevsky Prospekt. Kotomin contracted architect Vasily Stasov to build a palace in place of existing house, as if to compete with his former master. The new house was built in 1812-1815, and is mostly preserved in the same form today. The main facade featured a Doric order connecting the two parts of the ground floor. There were eight semi columns in the middle (which did not survive to present time), and a lodge with four columns at each side. At the top, the cornice was decorated with modillions and stucco rosettes. Wolf and Beranget Confectionery at Kotomin House. 1830s LithographSoon after the new building was completed, entrepreneurs Wolf and Beranget opened the confectionery at the first floor. It quickly became very popular, especially for the chocolate eggs with relief scenes dedicated to the victories in the Russo-Turkish war. By the 1820s, a number of magazines and newspapers in Saint Petersburg considered it the best confectioner's shop in the city, described as \\"temple of kickshaw and prodigality\\". In 1834, a Chinese cafe (Cafe chinois) was open on the same premises. The place was popular with literati, such as (at different times) Alexander Pushkin, Mikhail Lermontov, Taras Shevchenko, Nikolai Chernyshevsky, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Mikhail Petrashevsky, Ivan Panaev, Aleksey Plescheev and others. On January 27, 1837, about 4pm, Alexander Pushkin entered Wolf et Beranget Confectionery on his way to duel with Georges d'Anth√®s. Here he met with his friend Konstantin Danzas, who was to serve as a second at the duel. Pushkin had a glass of water or lemonade (Danzas didn't remember exactly) and they left. In less than an hour, Pushkin was mortally wounded by d'Anth√®s. A few days later, at the same place Mikhail Glinka read aloud the poem Death of a Poet by young Mikhail Lermontov. In 1858, a bookshop opened on the ground floor of Kotomin House. It became well known beyond the Saint Petersburg, and existed until 2001. Next to it, Pyotr Elisseeff, the founder of the merchants Elisseeff's dynasty, opened his first store selling \\"foreign wines and colonial goods\\". The confectionery was closed in the late 1840s. In 1877 F. Leiner open a restaurant in the Kotomin House. It was located at the second floor facing the Moika. And while confectionery was frequented by literati, Leiner's restaurant was popular in the theater circles. Its habitu√©s included Mamont Dalsky, Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Fyodor Shalyapin. According to the legend, on October 20, 1893, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky asked for a glass of water in the restaurant. \\"Sorry, we don't have boiled water\\" was the answer. Tchaikovsky replied - \\"Then bring the coolest raw water\\". He was served raw water, and left after single sip. In a few days the composer died from cholera, and rumors swung that the water was poisoned. In 1978-1981 Kotomin House was reconstructed. The lodges with four columns (previously concealed in 1846) were restored. In 1983 the Literary Cafe opened at the same location as Wolf et Beranget Confectionery. Carrying the tradition, besides being a restaurant, the place also organizes evenings of poetry and Russian romances.

History Curtin House was built in 1922 as the Tattersalls Club, on the site of Nunans's Buildings destroyed by fire on April 13, 1921. The fire claimed one victim, Miss Gertrude K Riley. Morton Parker Pimentel, director of Federation Films on the third floor, was accused of having started the fire deliberately, but the evidence was slight. The Tattersalls Club building contained shops on the ground floor, bar and dining room and meeting rooms on the next two floors for the Club members, who were from the horse racing world, and offices to let above. It was one of the first major works of architect Harry Norris, who went on to design many important city buildings in the interwar years. The Club either disbanded or merged with another club and left the building in 1937, when their rooms were put up for lease with the bar and other fitting sold off in 1940. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, the building housed the offices of the Victorian Branch of the Communist Party and its youth wing the League of Young Democrats. As supporters of Stalin, who had made a pact with Hitler, the CPA Australia was anti-war, and so seen as unpatriotic, and their offices and library here were famously raided on 17 June 1940 minutes after the Federal Cabinet decided to ban the party, 'seizing enough literature to fill two vans'. The League of Young Democrats had been spared, but were also raided on 25 February 1941 minutes after it too was declared illegal by Cabinet. By 1948, the name had been changed to Curtin House, when it was reported as having become the new home of the National Secretariat of Catholic Action, which included a range of Catholic organisations and a bookshop, in the old Club rooms on the first floor. It is presumed that the new name commemorated the wartime Labor Prime Minister John Curtin, who had died in office in 1945. He was a lapsed Catholic, but it is not known exactly why or when the name was changed. In 1967, it was leased by the Academy of Modern Greek (the Academy), a private Greek language school established by a group of community leaders to address the language, history and culture learning-needs of the school-aged children of the growing Greek community. Spiro Liolios was appointed Principal of the Academy and within a few months, he and his wife, Koula Liolios, took over the ownership of the school. The school flourished under their educational leadership and was the largest Greek school in Melbourne for many years, outgrowing all six floors of Curtin House by 1977; subsequently moving to the Theosophical Society Building, 187 Collins Street, Melbourne, where it continued to operate successfully until the 1990s. During the 60s and 70s, Spiro Liolios also operated a number of other businesses within the building, such as Golden Guide Publishing, which distributed the free community telephone book and community services guide, the Greek Golden Guide, to the Greek community; as well as the Italian Golden Guide, to the Italian community. He also established (with his accountant, Andrew Petrakis, as partner) and successfully operated a secretarial college, Swanston College, offering typing, shorthand, and office administration certificate and diploma courses. Spiro and Koula Liolios also successfully operated the Academy Interpreting and Translating for many years. All from within the six storeys of Curtin House. Through the 1980s and 90s, Curtin House was occupied by a range of business and organisations attracted by the cheap rent, such as the Genealogical Society, and eventually used for pop up exhibitions and not quite legal residential space. Famous residents included Barrie Kosky and Chunky Move dance company's artistic director Gideon Obarzanek. Transformation In 2000 it was bought by group of investors led by Tim Peach.Raising the Curtin, By Larissa Dubecki, April 4, 2007, The Age Following some restoration the rejuvenated Curtin House was progressively leased to a range of 'creative industries' and multiple food and entertainment venues. In 2003, the first to open was the bar-cum restaurant Cookie, occupying the high-ceilinged former club room on the first floor, developed by Camillo and Monika Ippoliti. The design by Phillip Schemnitz retained the main surviving features and combined them with careful interventions, and won a Hall of Fame gong in the 2018 Eat Drink awards. Melbourne's first rooftop cinema simply called Rooftop Cinema opened in 2006, and the Toff in Town live music and performance venue opened on the second floor in 2007. Other tenants Metropolis Bookstore which relocated from St Kilda in 2001. In 2019 tenants included the four street level shops, Cookie, the Toff, Metropolis, a rare record store, a hair salon and two clothes retailers on the 3rd floor, another clothes retailer, an architecture office,SIBLING and brand designer in the 4th floor, a whole floor residence on the 5th, and Mesa Verde restaurant on the 6th, and the Rooftop Bar and Cinema.

Gr√ºvis Malt has released a total of seven full-length albums, one of which was released under Lakeshore Entertainment subsidiary Lakeshore Records, and three EPs. The other albums were released independently under Gr√ºvis Malt's self-run label, Integers Only. Gr√ºvis Malt is known for their blending of genres (progressive rock, hip hop, jazz, and funk) and intense songwriting. They are the self-proclaimed founders of the \\"futurock\\" genre, which features a blending of irregular time signatures (like math rock), unconventional chord progressions, and abnormal song structure. Because of this blending of many genres of music, Gr√ºvis Malt is sometimes called a \\"musician's band.\\" The group stopped touring in 2005, after the release of their last album, Maximum Unicorn, in order to pursue solo projects and tangible income. History Gr√ºvis Malt was started in March 1995 in Providence, Rhode Island by high school students Gavin Castleton (keyboards), Brendan Bell (vocals/percussion), Ethan Ruzzano (guitar), Marco Herrera (drums) and Steve Martinka (bass guitar). The band had its beginnings in experimenting with random time signatures and heavy noise. At the end of the summer, Castleton moved to Portland, Oregon. Upon Gavin's return in 1996, Josh Hutchins (a.k.a. Johnny Longburns) joined the band as a turntablist and beatboxer, and Breakfast All Day, their first EP, was recorded at Diva Studios with David Stem. In 1997, Martinka and Hutchins both left the band. Brandon Clemmens replaced Martinka on the bass guitar and Rich Hall joined on percussion, and the six piece began writing the songs that would become the Fetus EP. In early 1998, Saunder Jurriaans replaced Brandon Clemmens on bass guitar. Erik Nilsson left school to become a full-time saxophonist with the band, and Ethan doubled on trombone. With a full-fledged horn section, the band wrote songs for the album Sound Soldiers, while reworking the songs on Breakfast All Day and the Fetus EP. The result was Cromagnetic, considered by the band as more of a compilation than a full-fledged album. In 1999, Gr√ºvis Malt released Sound Soldiers, an album many consider to be their musical \\"starting point\\". After rigorous regional touring throughout 1998 and 1999, Gr√ºvis Malt went on a month-long tour around the US in 2000. After the US tour, Ruzzano and Jurriaans resigned from the band and were replaced by Steve Geuting and Justin Abene respectively. Reed Wallsmith joined the band in 2001 on alto saxophone. The band began work on ...With the Spirit of a Traffic Jam..., their next full-length album (produced and recorded at Diva Studios on their own). DJ Chris Kilmore of the band Incubus, with whom they had played shows, DJ'd on 2 album tracks and one B-side, \\"Graduated\\". In spring of 2001 Reed left the band to return to his hometown of Portland, OR. In fall of 2001 the band signed with Lakeshore Records, a subsidiary of Lakeshore Entertainment. Throughout 2002 and 2003, Gr√ºvis Malt toured to promote the album, which was released on March 28, 2003. (The album hit stores April 9). Relations with the label were strained when Lakeshore refused to give the band copies of the record to sell at their record release party and shows throughout their US tour. The band parted ways with the label later that year, citing their having never received royalties as a violation of contract. In 2003, Gr√ºvis Malt recorded Simon at Sound Station Seven (the last album recorded there before it closed) with engineer Rob Pemberton. In 2004, Gavin and Brenden began working on separate side projects. Directly after the release of Simon, Gr√ºvis Malt stopped touring and began recording Maximum Unicorn in Justin Abene's Fall River studio. Maximum Unicorn was released in November 2005 on the Integers Only webstore, and no record release show was booked. In 2006, Justin Abene, Gavin Castleton, and Brendan Bell formed Ebu Gogo and toured the US from 2006 to 2009 in support of their two self-released full-lengths: Chase Scenes 1-14 and Worlds. Gavin Castleton has released several solo records and is currently a member of The Dear Hunter. The members of Gr√ºvis Malt always valued the integrity of the music more than the publicity they received for it; thus, they preferred to remain unsigned and advertised predominantly using a \\"grassroots\\" marketing scheme.

He was the founder of the Broadway restaurant-cabaret club \\"Churchill's\\", located on Forty-Ninth Street, which became one of the most popular establishments in New York City for over a decade prior to Prohibition.Asbury, Herbert. The Gangs of New York: An Informal History of the New York Underworld. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1928. (pg. 313) Biography Jim Churchill was born in Manhattan, New York in 1863. He was raised on Forty-Ninth Street, just \\"two steps off Broadway\\", and left elementary school at 4th grade to go to work. At age 21, he joined the New York City Police Department and was assigned to Chinatown where he remained for the next 20 years. Many of his most memorable stories came from his adventures he had as a patrolman. He retired at the rank of police captain around 1904 and, at the suggestion of friends and family, eventually entered the restaurant business.\\"James Churchill, Restaurateur, Dies; Founder of Broadway Cabaret of Pre-Prohibition Fame Succumbs at 67. Once A Police Captain; Declined Harding's Offer to Head Dry Enforcement Here--Victim of Pneumonia at Atlantic City\\". _New York Times._ 20 Jan 1930 He opened his first restaurant on Broadway which became an immediate success, despite his worries. His menu of chops, potatoes and ice cold beer attracted very large crowds and soon found his establishment to small to accommodate his customers. He sold his shop and bought a bigger place of Forty-Sixth Street, which seated 350 people, but this too proved too small and he eventually opened \\"Churchill's\\" in 1909. His establishment, built near his childhood home on Forty-Ninth Street, was built to seat 1,200 people and housed a French kitchen, top gourmet chefs and 300 employees. The restaurant-cabaret club quickly became not only famous in New York but also known throughout the country and internationally. It was a common occurrence that customers would have to wait in long lines simply to enter the restaurant. He later recalled that he spent $50,000 a year advertising a $250,000 business. In the spring of 1921, shortly after the passage of the Volstead Act, Churchill sold his restaurant and sold the building to a syndicate of American and Chinese food dealers who opened a chop suey restaurant in its place. He was invited to Washington, D.C. and personally approached President Warren G. Harding to offer him the position of Prohibition Administrator for the state of New York. He declined the appointment and said to the president \\"Mr. Harding, I sold liquor for about fifteen years before prohibition went into effect. What would you think of a man who would turn tail on his friends who are now selling liquor and try to stamp them out ? I must refuse the appointment\\". Churchill traveled abroad following the close of his restaurant. One notable journey he took was to the White House in 1923, where he reportedly served food to President Harding. On his return, he found that the city had changed during Prohibition. Among these, he commented on the subject on the employment of women in the restaurant industry \\"Hostesses ? There were no such things in my days. No one ever thought of such a thing. It was not permitted that any woman should come into a restaurant-cabaret unaccompanied. Instead of the hostesses, I employed thirty boys, one of them the late Rudolph Valentino, to dance with women who came unescorted for luncheon\\". In January 1930, he and his family visited Atlantic City, New Jersey. While staying at the Hotel Traymore, he died from a severe attack of bronchial pneumonia on January 19, 1930. His wife Anna and his three daughters were with him at the time of his death and afterwards brought him back to New York for burial.

The earliest surviving parts of the existing church are the north walls of the nave and chancel, which are of the mid-12th century. The church at this time comprised the nave and a short chancel. The chancel was extended in the late 12th century. By the mid-13th century the south aisle had been built. In the late 13th century, a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary had been built to the east of the south aisle and south of the chancel. The tower was added in the early 14th century, and the porch in about 1500. The tower formerly carried a much taller spire than the current smaller spirelet. It was destroyed in a storm in 1704. The weathervane dates from 1928 and is a copy of the one erected in 1704. The remains of a sundial can be seen on the porch; it fell into disuse when a clock was installed in the church.Guide leaflet to St Michael's East Peckham, The Churches Conservation Trust, October 2007 The vestry was added in the early 19th century. The church was restored by the Victorians in 1853 and 1863. St Michael's was listed at Grade II* in 1959, and it was declared redundant in 1973. Bells St Michael's has a ring of six bells hung for change ringing. The oldest (the fifth-heaviest of the ring) was cast in 1747 by Robert Catlin. Two (the second- and third-heaviest) were cast in 1785 by William Mears of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry. The heaviest (the sixth, usually called the tenor) was cast in 1812 and the lightest (the first, usually called the treble) was cast in 1825 by Thomas Mears II and the remaining bell (the fourth-heaviest) was cast in 1890, by Mears & Stainbank (all successors to Wiliam Mears at Whitechapel). Memorials Memorial to John Norwood, VC St Michael's has a number of memorials, including those to:- *Richard Etclesley, who died in 1426, bequeathing the gift of a chalice to the church. *The Henham family, who were farmers in East Peckham and propagated the Henham variety of hop. *John Norwood VC, who rescued a fallen comrade during the Second Boer War under intense enemy fire. *The Twysden family, who owned Roydon Hall, the manor of East Peckham.
