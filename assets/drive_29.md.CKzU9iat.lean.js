The exact time of its construction is not known; several dates ranging from antiquity to the 17th century were suggested, although more recent works have provisionally favoured construction in the 6th century AD. The wall featured about 300 towers, most of them now entirely or largely ruined. Location The wall begins near the mouth of Kelasuri and ends on the right bank of Enguri The wall begins near the mouth of Kelasuri River where the ruins of a large tower remained. It goes to the east crossing Kodori River near Tsebelda, then passes near Tkvarcheli and terminates near the village of Lekukhona on the right bank of Enguri. Most of the fortifications are located in the western part of the wall between Kelasuri and Mokvi Rivers. Kelasuri's left bank and mountain passes were most heavily fortified. On the other hand, only four towers were found between Tkvarcheli and Enguri. Towers The wall was not continuous as its builders made use of natural obstacles such as steep slopes and gorges. 279 towers belonging to the wall have been identified, about a hundred of them are extant. The usual distance between towers is 40–120 m, where there was no continuous wall some towers were 300, 500 and 1000 m apart. All the towers are rectangular (7 by 8 or 8 by 9 metres), 4–6 m high and have shallow foundations. Each tower had a door in its southern wall framed by massive stone beams, sometimes a narrow staircase was also added. Embrasures were usually located in the towers' northern and western walls on the second floor. History of construction Since the wall was first examined scientifically in early 19th century, many hypotheses on who and when built it were published. История изучения средневековых памятников Абхазии , Материалы по археологии Абхазии. Тбилиси, 1967, с. 115-128 For example, the Swiss traveller Frédéric Dubois de Montpéreux (fr) asserted that the wall was built by Greeks in the last centuries BC to protect their colony of Dioscurias (which he erroneously placed near the Kodori capeVoyage autour du Caucase: chez les Tcherkesses et les Abkhases, en Colchide, en Géorgie, en Arménie et en Crimée ; avec un atlas géographique, pittoresque, archéologique, géologique, etc. par Frédéric Dubois de Montpéreux. Paris, Libr. de Gide, 1839-1843. 6 v. According to Mikhail Ivashchenko, the wall was built by Byzantines in the 4th century to protect their possessions and control mountain passes. He connected the name of the river Kelasuri with Byzantine Greek kleisoura, a Byzantine territorial unit smaller than a theme. Several other historians supported this date although they could not agree on the length and orientation of the wall. Yuri Voronov, a well-known Abkhazian historian and archaeologist, examined the Abkhazian wall in 1966-1971 and proposed a new date of its construction. According to Voronov, Prince of Mingrelia, Levan II Dadiani built Kelasuri Walls between 1628 and 1653 to protect his fiefdom from the Abkhaz invasions (though at that time Principality of Abkhazia was a nominal vassal of Mingrelia). Per Voronov's work the embrasures in the wall were made for firearms; he also quoted Georgian historian Vakhushti and Italian missionary Arcangelo Lamberti who both wrote about the wall built by Megrelian princes for protection from the Abkhaz.Ю.Н.

The Ki-43 was reconstructed from several captured aircraft, by the Technical Air Intelligence Unit (TAIU), at Hangar 7 at Eagle Farm, Brisbane. Technical Air Intelligence Units (TAIU) were joint Allied military intelligence units formed during World War II to recover Japanese aircraft to obtain data regarding their technical and tactical capabilities. The first such unit, known later as Technical Air Intelligence Unit-South West Pacific (TAIU-SWPA), was formed in November 1942 by the United States Navy (USN), United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) at Eagle Farm Airbase, Brisbane, Australia, in November 1942. During 1943-44, three other TAIUs were formed in the other Allied theatres of the Pacific War.Harold Skaarup, 2006, RCAF War Prize Flights, German and Japanese Warbird Survivors, Bloomington Indiana, iUniverse, pp33-4. * South East Asia: ATAIU-SEA; British Royal Air Force (RAF)/USAAF * Pacific Ocean Areas: TAIU-POA; USN * China: Republic of China Air Force A proposed joint U.S. Army-U.S. Navy research unit in the continental United States was never established, as neither service was prepared to work with the other. Some Japanese aircraft were tested in the US, at various bases, by pilots from the Naval Air Test Center, the USAAF Test Training Unit (which was established with the assistance of RAF technical intelligence units in Europe) and the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. Crashed and captured aircraft were located, identified, and evaluated (often in or near the front lines), before being recovered for further tests. Aircraft that were not too badly damaged were rebuilt for test flights that revealed vulnerabilities that could be exploited. Examination of the materials used in the construction of aircraft allowed the Allies to analyse Japanese war production. The unit also absorbed a small team who developed the code name system for Japanese aircraft, and produced aircraft recognition charts and photographs. Early technical air intelligence operations The attack on Pearl Harbor demonstrated the key role of aircraft in the Pacific War, but the United States possessed virtually no information about the capabilities of Japanese aircraft. Several shot down aircraft were recovered from Hawaii and examined by the Naval Air Test Center and the USAAF Test Training Unit, who completed their own separate studies. A Mitsubishi A6M \\"Zero\\" of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service made a forced landing in June 1942 on Akutan Island, off Alaska. The aircraft (known later as the \\"Akutan Zero\\") was recovered by the USN and shipped to NAS North Island, California, where it was repaired and made a number of test flights to determine its performance and capabilities. In late 1942, the Australian Army captured lightly damaged or incomplete examples of the Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa (\\"Oscar\\") - the main fighter used by the Imperial Japanese Army Air Force during the war - in Papua New Guinea. The Ki-43s were discovered nearly intact at Buna Airfield, after the Battle of Buna–Gona, and were shipped to Australia for examination.

A6M2 (left) and A6M5 Zero in Malaya being tested and evaluated by Japanese pilots under the supervision of RAF officers. The A6M5's cockpit survives today at the Imperial War Museum Duxford. It was in order to consolidate and co-ordinate these different operations that the Technical Air Intelligence Unit was formed, based in Hangar 7 at the RAAF/USAAF Eagle Farm Airbase, in Brisbane, Australia, during November 1942. By early 1943 an \\"Oscar\\" had been built using parts from five different aircraft. Test flights included a mock dogfight against a Spitfire V. It was concluded that the \\"Oscar\\" was superior to the Spitfire below 20,000 feet. In late 1943 the aircraft was shipped to the United States aboard the escort carrier , and sent to Wright Field where it was flown and evaluated. Mitsubishi A6M2 \\"Zero\\" at the National Museum of the United States Air Force at Dayton, Ohio. This aircraft was found near Kavieng on New Ireland, Papua New Guinea, and probably operated by the 6th Kokutai (Squadron) and later by the 253rd Kokutai. It is painted to represent a section leader's aircraft from the aircraft carrier during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea in March 1943. Further success came in late December 1943, when US Marines captured the airfield at Cape Gloucester on the north coast of New Britain, finding many wrecks and several nearly intact aircraft. TAIU officers logged the serial numbers of the aircraft, and engine configurations, serial numbers and dates of manufacture. They inspected cockpits for layout and control locations, and armour plate. They recovered armaments and noted their locations and mounts. Some reports provided considerable detail, including oil and fuel tank capacities, and special electronics installed. One of these was a Kawasaki Ki-45 \\"Nick\\" fighter, about which little was known. Another fighter, a Kawasaki Ki-61 \\"Tony\\", was also examined. One of the biggest problems faced by the TAIU teams was Allied troops, who commonly stripped enemy aircraft for \\"souvenirs\\". Efforts were made to minimize indiscriminate souvenir hunting and troops were encouraged to turn in all captured items and report enemy aircraft wrecks. Most of these efforts were in vain, and it remained a constant problem throughout the war. Another obstacle was that most Japanese aircraft fell into the ocean, and those that did not often crashed in isolated areas that were difficult to reach. As an example, a newly developed Yokosuka D4Y \\"Judy\\" dive bomber with an in-line engine crashed six miles inland, on a hill, on Santa Isabel Island. The TAIU had to recruit local men to cut a trail to the crash site with machetes, and then carry out the engine on a cradle woven from tree bark. Crashed Enemy Aircraft Reports (CEARs) were systematically compiled from April 1943. In February 1944, it was agreed that production data on enemy equipment was essential, and more extensive reports detailed the age and condition of captured equipment to give an indication of the general state of the Japanese war economy, paying particular attention to the name plates and markings which gave information on the manufacturers. Eventually a special unit known as \\"JAPLATE\\" was created to conduct this task, and 6,336 intact name plates or their details were collected. In mid-1944, U.S. Navy personnel were withdrawn from the TAIU and reassigned to NAS Anacosta to form the Technical Air Intelligence Centre (TAIC) to centralise and co-ordinate the work of test centres in the United States with the work of TAIUs in the field. The unit was then renamed TAIU for the South West Pacific Area (TAIU-SWPA). Technical Air Intelligence operations were fully developed by the time of the invasion of the Philippines. Considerable instruction was given to the troops on the equipment likely to be found and the importance of its preservation. The TAIU-SWPA moved from Australia to the Philippines in early 1945 and gained an appreciation of the state of enemy technological and economic development essential to the build-up for the planned invasion of Japan. Aircraft acquired there included examples of the Mitsubishi A6M Zero, Mitsubishi J2M \\"Jack\\", Kawasaki Ki-45 \\"Nick\\", Kawasaki Ki-61 \\"Tony\\", Kawanishi N1K \\"George\\", Nakajima Ki-44 \\"Tojo\\", and Nakajima Ki-84 \\"Frank\\" fighters; the Nakajima B5N \\"Kate\\", Nakajima B6N \\"Jill\\", Yokosuka D4Y \\"Judy\\", and Mitsubishi G4M \\"Betty\\" bombers; the Showa L2D \\"Tabby\\" transport, and the Mitsubishi Ki-46 \\"Dinah\\" reconnaissance aircraft. Other Technical Air Intelligence Units One Aichi B7A Ryusei tested for the ATAIU-SEA. A joint RAF/USAAF unit, known as the TAIU for South East Asia (ATAIU-SEA) was formed in Calcutta in late 1943, and disbanded at Singapore in 1946. Two other units were also created; \\"TAIU for the Pacific Ocean Area\\" (TAIU-POA), a U.S. Navy unit which operated in the Pacific Islands, and \\"TAIU for China\\" (TAIU-CHINA) under the control of Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists. Post-war operations Technical Air Intelligence Units operated in Japan after the end of the war, shifting from tactical intelligence to post-hostilities investigations. General Hap Arnold ordered the preservation of four of every type of aircraft one of each for the USAAF, USN, RAF and museum collections. By the end of 1945 these were collected together at Yokohama Naval Base. One hundred and fifteen aircraft were shipped to the United States, with 73 going to the Army and 42 to the Navy. However, lack of funds, storage space and interest meant that only six aircraft were restored, flown and evaluated by the Army and only two by the Navy. Eventually, 46 complete aircraft were sent to various museums while the rest were scrapped. By early 1946 ATAIU-SEA in Singapore had collected 64 Japanese Army and Navy aircraft, most in flyable condition, for shipment to the UK. However, lack of shipping space prevented this operation and only four eventually arrived in England to be put in display in museums.

It can also be viewed as a southern extension of the Julian Alps. The main part of the plateau is in Slovenia, while the southern part extends into Croatia and connects to the mountain region of Gorski Kotar.  Geology and Climate  It mainly consists of Cretaceous limestone, with Jurassic limestone and a small amount of dolomite at the top. The surface was transformed by ice in the last glacial period. It is generally level, but has numerous dry valleys, sinkholes, about 300 caves and shafts, and cold-air pools with temperatures reaching in the coldest part of year. The surface is mainly stony, covered with patchy and shallow soil, except for the larger depressions. Because the plateau is only from the Adriatic Sea, it has up to of precipitation per year. It is covered by snow in winter. Due to the karst nature of the plateau, there are no surface streams.  Biology  The vegetation of Snežnik was first studied in the 19th century by Heinrich Freyer, who was later the curator of the Estate Museum of Carniola in Ljubljana. It is Central European, with a large contribution of Southern European species and montane flora above the timberline. In sinkholes, vegetation inversion and a lower timberline (otherwise rare in Slovenia) may be observed. The plateau is covered by beech and fir forests, except for the highest parts covered by dwarf pine and grass. The area of Snežnik above covers and was protected in 1964 as a natural landmark. It is a habitat for Edraianthus graminifolius, Arabis scopoliana, Campanula justiniana, Nigritella rubra, Gentiana clusii, Gentiana pannonica, and other flowers. The animals living there include brown bears, wolves, deer, wild boars, and lynx, as well as a number of bird species such as the Ural owl, corn crake, western capercaillie, hazel grouse, and golden eagle.  Peaks  The plateau has the following two main peaks: * Big Mount Snežnik (), , Slovenia * Little Mount Snežnik (), , Slovenia Note that on the Croatian side of the border, 20 km to the south in the Risnjak National Park of Gorski Kotar, there is a mountain also called Snježnik or Snežnik with an altitude of GeoNames  Hiking  Big Mount Snežnik is the highest non-Alpine peak of Slovenia and the highest peak along the National Liberation War Courier and Signal Operator Trail (). It may be seen from many other parts of Slovenia and is a popular hiking destination. It offers an extensive view and has a toposcope. It is most easily accessible from Sviščaki, a hamlet of the dispersed settlement of Snežnik, on the plateau. The Drago Karolin Lodge () is located just below the peak of Big Mount Snežnik towards the border with Croatia. It was first built as a shelter under the leadership of the professor and mountaineer Drago Karolin, the president of the Snežnik Ilirska Bistrica Mountaineering Club. It was expanded from 1977 to 1994 and named after its first builder.

Alexandre Olivier Glais de Bizoin (9 March 1800 - 6 November 1877), also known as Glais-Bizoin was a French republican politician during the July Monarchy and critic of the First French Empire and the retour des cendres.  Biography  Alexandre Glais-Bizoin was born in Quintin to a rich family from the department of Côtes-du-Nord. He was the grandson of a textiles merchant from Saint-Thélo and the son of Olivier Glais-Bizoin (1742-1801), a textiles merchant and delegate to the National Assembly of France. Alexandre completed his studies for a law degree, but after becoming a lawyer in 1822 left the bar for politics. Aligning with the left, he fought with the liberals against the House of Bourbon, restored to throne after the fall of the First Empire in 1815. After the July Revolution of 1830, Glais-Bizoin was named to the general council (conseil général) of Côtes-du-Nord and on July 5, 1831, he was elected delegate to the National Assembly from Loudéac, a commune in Côtes-du-Nord. He joined the far-left and was repeatedly reelected during the entire reign of Louis Philippe: June 21, 1834; November 4, 1837; March 2, 1839; July 9, 1842; and August 1, 1846. The Dictionnaire des parlementaires français describes Glais-Bizoin thus: \\"a determined adversary of the government's policies, he distinguished himself less by his speeches than by his interruptions.\\" He was one of 39 delegates to support the 1832 June Rebellion, an unsuccessful republican insurrection. He pestered the established powers with questions and critiques, most of all working toward a reduction in taxes on salt and letters and the abolition of required stamps for journals. He opposed the September 1835 laws, which consolidated the power of the July Monarchy and limited certain freedoms. And contrary to most other parliamentarians, he spoke out against the retour des cendres, or the repatriation of the remains of Napoleon Bonaparte after his death in 1840. Glais-Bizoin said, \\"Bonapartist ideas are one of the open wounds of our time; they represent that which is most fatal to the emancipation of peoples, most contrary to the independence of the human spirit.\\" On the subject of the postal system, Glais-Bizoin is known for having proposed the adoption of a uniform rate for sending a letter, regardless of the distance to the destination. He fought for this reform between 1839 and 1847, and it was finally adopted in 1848. On the other hand, he had little to do with the establishment of postal stamps, beliefs to the contrary notwithstanding. He supported electoral reform, and took active part in the Campagne des banquets, which resulted in the overthrow of the Louis Philippe. After having associated himself with those demanding the indictment of François Guizot, the last prime minister in the July Monarchy, he rallied to the newly established French Second Republic. He was elected to the constituent assembly from the department of Côtes-du-Nord on April 23, 1848. Toward the end of the French Second Empire in 1869, he was elected a deputy to the national assembly from the Seine, a former department encompassing Paris and its close suburbs. He participated in the Government of National Defense, the first government of the French Third Republic led by Léon Gambetta which rose to power after military disaster in the Franco-Prussian War caused the collapse of Napoleon III. In 1868, Glais-Bizoin was one of the founders of the journal La Tribune. He hired Émile Zola as secretary for the journal in 1870. He died in 1877 at Saint-Brieuc, where he had been head of the municipal government since 1870.

He was succeeded by Francesca McDonagh in October 2017, having taken on the role on 25 February 2009 from Brian Goggin, who resigned following the injection of Irish Government funds and the guarantee of deposits. His 2012 pay was €843,000. Career and education Boucher was chief executive of Bank of Ireland's Irish Retail Division since January 2006 where he oversaw the company's land bank and development loans growing to €7.1 billion. He was appointed as a Director of the Group in October 2006. He joined Bank of Ireland in December 2003 as chief executive, Corporate Banking from the Royal Bank of Scotland where he had been Regional managing director – Corporate Banking, London and South East England and previously held a number of prominent roles with the Ulster Bank Group and also worked in ICC Bank. He was born in Kitwe in Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia) to Irish parents, his father being from Dublin and his mother being from County Cavan. He was primarily educated at St George's College, a Catholic boarding school in Salisbury in Southern Rhodesia (now Harare in Zimbabwe). He later attended Rockwell College, County Tipperary, and Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated with a degree in business before pursuing a career in banking. He has never lost his distinctive Rhodesian/Southern African accent though he did spend his first seventeen years in Southern Africa. Evidence to Oireachtas On 2 July 2008 he told the Oireachtas Finance Committee \\"unequivocally, we do not think there is a Northern Rock in Ireland\\", and the Central Bank here has stricter rules for how much ready cash banks must hold than any other country where the group does business. > \\"We do not believe that we have capital problems. The issues that we face > are more down to liquidity rather than capital”, and added there were no > arrears on his bank's portfolio of 100% > mortgages.http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2008/07/03/story66438.asp In January 2011, he admitted that information supplied to the Dáil on bank staff bonuses was both misleading and incorrect. Boucher accepted that Bank of Ireland was responsible for Minister for Finance Brian Lenihan putting '‘erroneous information'’ on the Dáil record to the effect that no performance-related bonuses were paid to staff. The next month a top civil servant accused Boucher of \\"hiding behind\\" words and misleading the government during a blazing row over the bonuses. There were heated exchanges at a November 2012 Oireachtas finance committee meeting as Boucher would not answer repeated questions, including how much debt the bank had written off on unsustainable mortgages. Independent TD Stephen Donnelly accused Boucher of treating the committee with contempt by not answering questions. Fine Gael TD Kieran O'Donnell said his refusal to answer questions showed a \\"lack of moral compass\\" and that \\"nothing had changed\\". Chairman Labour TD Ciarán Lynch said he was being 'minimalist' in his answers and added it was totally unacceptable for Boucher or any banker to hide behind some \\"opaque notion of commercial confidentiality. What the Irish public demand is nothing short of full disclosure. Far from the impression that the committee was a witch hunt, we were entitled to get the information we asked for'. Another committee member said the performance of Boucher was the epitome of arrogance, and likened his lack of engagement to a 'McCarthy-ite trial response'\\". Following his appearance, the Sunday Independent said that \\"He is a hard bastard with a hide like a rhino\\" and is the \\"embodiment of all that is bad in Irish banking\\". Subsequently Labour TD Arthur Spring told Finance Minister Michael Noonan that he should seek the resignation of Boucher because his behaviour \\"could be damaging to the Bank of Ireland brand\\". Spring, a former Bank of Ireland official, also told Noonan, whose Government maintains a 15% stake in Bank of Ireland, that he should canvass and build \\"alliances\\" with other investors on this issue. Relationship with property developers He advised property developer Seán Dunne on his acquisition of the iconic Jury's hotel site in Ballsbridge. Speaking to Marian Finucane on RTÉ, Dunne recalled the days immediately after he agreed to purchase the Jury's site for €275m, which he planned to turn into the Knightsbridge of Ireland. \\"I phoned up a very good friend of mine, Richie Boucher. He's now deputy head of Bank of Ireland ... And, after about Wednesday, Richie said, 'Seán', he said, 'if I was trying to borrow the money you're trying to borrow, I wouldn't stay in Thailand. I'd come back to Dublin.' So I thought that was good advice, even though I wanted to stay in Thailand with my wife and son\\", Dunne recollected. On 3 October 2007, the planning department in Dublin City Council received a letter from Boucher, giving his address as the office of chief executive of Bank of Ireland Group's retail financial services at head office in Lower Baggot Street. it was headed \\"Jurys/Berkeley Court Site ... Dear Sir, I refer to the above and write to confirm my strong support for this landmark proposal which I believe will significantly benefit the city of Dublin and its citizens through helping enhance the concept of a living city and providing buildings of significant architectural merit befitting Ireland of the 21st century. Yours faithfully, Richie Boucher, chief executive, Retail Financial Services Ireland.\\" Personality and appointment as chief executive A banking analyst who has dealt with Boucher, and has observed BoI's changing fortunes over the past couple of years, said Boucher has '‘a very strong personality. In that way he would be a very different fish to his predecessor Brian Goggin. But he's a very personable guy outside work. Prem Watsa, chief executive of Fairfax, told Reuters the BoI boss was '‘very disciplined, focused, very commercial\\". Boucher came up against Des Crowley, the head of Bank of Ireland's UK business for the CEO's job. He was the board's unanimous choice to be chief executive and for his \\"expertise, determination and pragmatism after an exhaustive process in Ireland and internationally, involving internal and external candidates.\\"Murphy & Devlin, Banksters, Pages 226–232,Hachette Books Ireland 2009, Accepting the appointment, Boucher said he was \\"very conscious of the current state of the financial services industry, the low opinion which the general public has of banks and the very difficult economic conditions that we face\\". He said he fully accepted \\"that we have an uphill battle as we work towards restoring the trust and confidence of our customers, stockholders and the general public. It is my commitment that I will work relentlessly with my colleagues in Bank of Ireland to win this confidence\\". In August 2011, Boucher retained the services of a US consultancy firm to help him prepare his submission for the Central Bank's review of whether legacy directors of bailed-out banks contributed to their institutions' demise and, if so, whether they are \\"fit and proper\\" to continue in their roles. 11 months later the Central Bank of Ireland issued a statement saying Boucher could continue in his role after passing the \\"Fitness and Probity\\" review. Reactions to appointment Billionaire businessman Dermot Desmond, who was a substantial shareholder in the bank, wrote to all members of the board expressing his \\"dismay\\" at Boucher's appointment. He said Boucher was one of the most senior bankers in the organisation, as a director, chief executive of retail financial services, a member of the group risk policy committee and of the group investment committee.“There has to be a direct correlation between Boucher's appointment to these senior positions and the excess lending policies of the bank.“How did Mr Boucher and others within the bank view the warnings of the Central Bank of Ireland in 2004 concerning the overheated residential property market?” Desmond said the appointment of Boucher sent out \\"completely and utterly the wrong message. People who invested their pensions and savings in Bank of Ireland shares have been put under extreme financial pressure through absolutely no fault of their own. People are quite rightly angry.“Credibility and confidence need to be restored. This will not be achieved by promoting existing management further up the chain ... [a] clean break is needed. The people who got the bank into the mess are not the people to get the bank out of the mess.” Desmond said the bank's directors were obviously seriously out of touch with market perception and the sentiments of shareholders, accountholders and the market generally if they thought otherwise. \\"Therefore [he] must have been responsible for fatal errors of judgment, including advancing loans to developers on the strength of overstated land values and insufficient security. He said he had nothing personal against Mr Boucher but perception was important if public confidence and the external reputation of the Irish banking system were to be restored.\\" The Labour party said the decision to appoint an internal candidate as chief executive is \\"most disappointing ... I am not in any way casting any aspersions on Mr Boucher's ability or integrity, but this is a missed opportunity to signal a new beginning in Irish banking\\", said spokeswoman on Finance, Joan Burton. Senator Shane Ross raised the appointment in the Senate and—while later admitting hyperbole—said \\"possibly the most disgraceful appointment in the business world in living memory.\\"Ross Shane, The Bankers,Pages 228–230,Penguin Ireland 2009; Personal life He is married to Sandra Boucher, has two children, Katie and Keith and lives in Foxrock, Dublin. He is a first cousin of Eamon Delaney (their mothers were sisters). A rugby fan, he trains a children's rugby team. His basic salary is €690,000 (The Irish Government put a €500,000 salary cap on chief executives of state- guaranteed banks). Additionally, among other benefits, he has an annual car cash allowance of €34,000, and receives free tax advice in accordance with executive levels. The employment contract includes a permanent gagging clause. As at 31 December 2009 he had €946,000 in loans from the Bank of Ireland, with €708,000 described as \\"other loans\\" and €235,000 in mortgage loans. In April 2010, following contact between the Taoiseach's department and the bank he waived his option to retire on pension at 55 and thus removed the need to top up his pension by €1.5m.

It is held on the first Saturday in June (with numerous other events in the area during the preceding week). History The first documented event, in June 1991, had 3,000 gays and lesbians from central Florida going to area theme parks on one day wearing red shirts to make their presence more visible. By 1995, the event had grown to 10,000 gays and lesbians traveling for the gay day at Disney. As of 2010 approximately 150,000 LGBT people, their families, friends and supporters attended the six-day gathering (including various pool parties, conventions, festivals, a business expo, activities for kids, etc.) with 20,000 to 30,000 going to Disney on the final day. The popularity of the event is seen by some attendees as a way of \\"reclaiming\\" normal joys of childhood lost to homophobia in their earlier years. Growth in attendance also reflects the growing number of LGBT families with children as well as increasing number of LGBT marriages, since Disney World is also a top honeymoon destination. A local Doubletree resort has dubbed itself the \\"official\\" hotel for the event, with convention space rented to various businesses (bathroom remodelers, gourmet cooking suppliers, sex toys, etc.) and organizations (free health tests, vaccinations, etc.) pitching to attendees. Criticism Gay Days have attracted criticism from religious groups. While Disney does not sanction Gay Days (and officially tells employees to treat it as any other summer day), conservative Christian groups accuse Disney of not doing anything to stop the event. The Southern Baptist Convention boycotted Disney for eight years. The Florida Family Association flew banner planes one year warning families of gay events at Disney that weekend, citing emails from people nationwide who unknowingly booked their vacation during Gay Days. Janet Porter, president of the Christian organization \\"Faith 2 Action\\", is highly critical of the event. She encouraged families to re-think visiting Walt Disney World. She told families to expect to see \\"cross-dressing men parading public displays of perversion\\" during their visit.

The core of the work transcribes Las Cases' near-daily conversations with the former Emperor on his life, his career, his political philosophy, and the conditions of his exile. First published in 1823 after Napoleon's death, the work was an immediate and continuing literary success, receiving multiple translations and appearing in new editions throughout the 19th century and into the 20th. The work entered the popular imagination as something like Napoleon's own personal and political testament, and as such became a founding text in the development of the Napoleon cult and the ideology of Bonapartism.  Composition and Publication  Las Cases began his journal on June 20, 1815, two days after Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, and continued it until his expulsion from St. Helena on orders of the island's governor, Hudson Lowe, at the end of the following year. According to Las Cases, the project of the Memorial commenced in early August, 1815 aboard the Bellerophon, where Napoleon was waiting for the ship that would transport him and a small party of companions to St. Helena. Napoleon suggests he finds comfort in the thought of suicide, but Las Cases insists there will still be purpose for them in the \\"desolate place\\" of exile: > \\"Sire, ... we will live on the past: there is enough in it to satisfy us. Do > we not enjoy the life of Caesar and that of Alexander? We shall possess > still more, you will re-peruse yourself, Sire!\\" \\"Be it so!\\" rejoined > Napoleon; \\"we will write our Memoirs.\\" At some point Las Cases began a daily routine of transcribing notes of the Emperor's conversation, leaving his son Emmanuel the task of producing a fair copy. From time to time Las Cases would provide Napoleon with excerpts to read, thus assuring himself of Napoleon's imprimatur. Being found in possession of personal letters that he was attempting to send surreptitiously to Europe, Las Cases was arrested on November 25, 1816, and expelled from St. Helena a month later. British authorities confiscated the manuscript of the Memorial and sent it to England in the keeping of the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, Henry Bathurst. The manuscript was not returned to Las Cases until five years later, following the Emperor's death. The Memorial was reprinted for the first time less than a year after its publication in 1823, and was translated into English, German, Italian, Spanish and Swedish. It was one of the bestselling books in France in the years between 1826 and 1840. In 1950, it was selected for inclusion in the French classics series La Pléiade.

There are two versions of the BFM used: The earlier version was first introduced by I. Carmesin and Kurt Kremer in 1988, and the later version by J. Scott Shaffer in 1994. Conversion between models is possible. ModelCarmesin and Kremer version= In this model the monomers are represented by cubes on a regular cubic lattice with each cube occupying eight lattice positions. Each lattice position can only be occupied by one monomer in order to model excluded volume. The monomers are connected by a bond vector, which is taken from a set of typically 108 allowed vectors. There are different definitions for this vector set. One example for a bond vector set is made up from the six base vectors below using permutation and sign variation of the three vector components in each direction: : \\\\mathbf{B} = \\\\mathbf{P_\\\\pm} \\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} 2  0  0 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right) \\\\cup \\\\\\\\!\\\\ \\\\mathbf{P_\\\\pm} \\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} 2  1  0 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right) \\\\cup \\\\\\\\!\\\\ \\\\mathbf{P_\\\\pm} \\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} 2  1  1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right) \\\\cup \\\\\\\\!\\\\ \\\\mathbf{P_\\\\pm} \\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} 2  2  1 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right) \\\\cup \\\\\\\\!\\\\ \\\\mathbf{P_\\\\pm} \\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} 3  0  0 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right) \\\\cup \\\\\\\\!\\\\ \\\\mathbf{P_\\\\pm} \\\\left( \\\\begin{matrix} 3  1  0 \\\\end{matrix} \\\\right) The resulting bond lengths are 2, \\\\sqrt{5}, \\\\sqrt{6}, 3 and \\\\sqrt{10}. The combination of bond vector set and monomer shape in this model ensures that polymer chains cannot cross each other, without explicit test of the local topology. The basic movement of a monomer cube takes place along the lattice axes : \\\\mathbf{\\\\Delta B} = \\\\mathbf{P_\\\\pm} \\\\left(1, 0, 0 \\\\right) so that each of the possible bond vectors can be realized. =Shaffer's version= As in the case of the Carmesin-Kremer BFM, the Shaffer BFM is also constructed on a simple-cubic lattice. However, the lattice points, or vertices of each cube are the sites that can be occupied by a monomer. Each lattice point can be occupied by one monomer only. Successive monomers along a polymer backbone are connected by bond vectors. The allowed bond vectors must be one of: (a) A cube edge (b) A face diagonal or (c) A solid diagonal. The resulting bond lengths are 1, \\\\sqrt{2}, \\\\sqrt{3}. In addition to the bond length constraint, polymers should not be allowed to cross. This is done most efficiently by the use of a secondary lattice which is twice as fine as the original lattice. The secondary lattice tracks the midpoints of the bonds in the system, and forbids the overlap of bond midpoints. This effectively leads to disallowing polymers from crossing each other. Monte Carlo step In both versions of the BFM, a single attempt to move one monomer consists of the following steps which are standard for Monte Carlo methods: # Select a monomer m and a direction \\\\Delta \\\\mathbf{B} \\\\in \\\\mathbf{P}_\\\\pm(1,0,0) randomly # Check list of conditions (see below) # If all conditions are fulfilled, perform move The conditions to perform a move can be subdivided into mandatory and optional ones. Mandatory conditions for Carmesin-Kremer BFM # Four lattice sites next to monomer m in the direction d are empty # The move does not lead to bonds that are not contained in the bond vector set. Mandatory conditions for Shaffer BFM # The lattice site to which the chosen monomer is going to be moved is empty # The move does not lead to bonds that are not contained in the bond vector set. # The move does not lead to overlapping of bond midpoints. Optional conditions If the move leads to an energetic difference \\\\Delta U for example due to an electric field or an adsorbing force to the walls. In this case a Metropolis algorithm is applied: The Metropolis rate p_M which is defined as :p_M = e^{-\\\\Delta U/k_B T} \\\\, is compared to a random number r from the interval [0, 1). If the Metropolis rate is smaller than r the move is rejected, otherwise it is accepted.

Published in 1791 by Thomas Cadell, the novel tells the story of an adopted orphan who discovers the secret of her parentage and marries the man she loves. It is a courtship novel that follows the typical Cinderella plot while still commenting on contemporary political issues. Celestina is a satire of traditional English class and gender assumptions, particularly the idea that nobility is connected to rank or wealth. The heroine's worth lies in her \\"enlightened human soul\\";Qtd. in Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 17. she is valuable in and of herself. As a model for young readers, Celestina was liberating—she was independent and assertive. While Celestina is a heroine of sensibility who relies on her feelings to develop sympathy for others, it is the hero, Willoughby, who is the most sentimental of all, reversing the stereotypical association of strong emotions with femininity. In this novel, it is the women who remain strong and the men who are prey to their feelings. Throughout the novel, Smith included portraits of herself and her husband. Readers were interested in her personal story and bought her works to discover what was happening in her life, therefore she included barely disguised autobiographical details in the novel. The novel was well received by reviewers and eventually ran to four editions during the 1790s; however, the novel was not published again until the 2000s. Jane Austen, who read Smith's novels as they were published, responded to her description of sensibility with Sense and Sensibility. Plot summary An orphaned Celestina is adopted from a convent in the south of France when she is a young girl by Mrs. Willoughby—nothing is known of her parentage. Celestina is raised along with Mrs. Willoughby's own children, Matilda and George. The children grow up happily. Mrs. Willoughby dies early in the novel, urging George to marry her brother's (Lord Castlenorth) daughter, Miss Fitz-Hayman, so that the family estate can be saved from financial ruin. Matilda marries Mr. Molyneux, becoming ambitious and haughty. She begins to despise Celestina and refuses her company. Celestina becomes friends with a servant named Jessy and helps reunite her with her lover, Cathcart, who is George Willoughby's steward. Willoughby and Celestina discover that they love each other and decide to marry, despite the monetary impediments. Vavasour, Willoughby's friend, also becomes enamored of Celestina; he flees before the wedding. Unfortunately, on the evening before the marriage, Willoughby suddenly takes off and it is unclear whether he will ever return – Celestina is devastated. Celestina moves in with the Thorolds, the local rector and his family, after Willoughby abandons her. Their son, Montague, develops an ardent attachment for her and she decides to leave to escape his overtures. Believing that Willoughby will eventually marry Miss Fitz-Hayman, Vavasour becomes an importunate suitor of Celestina, along with Montague. She is harassed. Willoughby reveals in a letter that Lady Castlenorth suggested to him that he and Celestina are brother and sister, and therefore cannot marry. He has therefore determined to go to France and discover the truth. Celestina leaves the Thorods and tours Scotland with Mrs. Elphinstone, a relative of Cathcart and Jessy. Her life has been full of struggles. Her sister, Emily, became a \\"kept\\" woman and Mrs. Elphinstone was forced to accept money from her while she was poverty- stricken. Her husband dies in a tragic storm at sea while they are in Scotland. Montague pursues her Celestina to Scotland. Celestina flees Scotland for London, establishing herself at Lady Horatia's. Lady Horatia encourages her to marry someone other than Willoughby. Willoughby returns to London, but because of miscommunication and interference of other parties, both he and Celestina believe the other is no longer interested. Willoughby agrees to marry Miss Fitz-Hayman to save his family's estate, but at the last minute he decides not to go through with it and she marries someone else. In the meantime, Montague and Vavasour duel over Celestina. When Willougby travels to France to tell his uncle that he is no longer marrying Miss Fitz-Hayman, he discovers the secret of Celestina's birth when he stays with some peasants. The two are now free to marry. Genre and style \\"On some rude fragment of the rocky shore... Musing, my solitary seat I take, And listen to the deep and solemn roar.\\"Qtd. in Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 22. =Courtship novel= Celestina is a \\"courtship novel\\", “which centres on a young girl's entrance into adult society and her choice among competing suitors”. During the 18th century, the courtship novel allowed authors to comment on a wide range of social topics, including economics, gender roles, and politics.Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 9. Often these novels followed a Cinderella pattern in which a virtuous orphan highlights the depravity of the seemingly respectable characters. However, in the end, the orphan usually turns out to be wealthy and a legitimate member of the aristocracy.Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 9–10. Smith's first three novels—Emmeline (1788), Ethelinde (1789), and Celestina—follow this pattern but also contain unique elements; as Loraine Fletcher explains in her introduction to the Broadview Press edition of Celestina, all three have “self-possessed, reflective heroines, conflicting family relationships, acerbic radical satire, acceptance that marriage is a woman's goal but that great caution is necessary in achieving it, a more tolerant attitude to extramarital sex and the 'fallen' woman than is usually found in English novels of the 18th and 19th centuries, threatening castles emblematic of gender and national hierarchies, and contrasting locations including sublime mountains landscape.”Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 10. =Autobiography= Beginning with her Elegiac Sonnets in 1784, Smith included autobiographical material in her works, relaying “a saga of her own marital unhappiness, poverty and anxiety about her children”.Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 21. Readers purchased her works partially because they wanted to hear the unfolding story of her life. The narratives of Jessy and Sophy contain references to Smith's own life that readers of the Sonnets would have recognised and to which reviewers alluded. For example, Sophy's marriage to a merchant whose wealth was built on the slave trade, her suffering as a mother, and the loss of her children, all parallel Smith's own life.Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 21, 29. The heroine is widely read and a poet, signalling her connection with Smith. For Celestina, “literature is talismanic, her greatest help in times of trouble”, as it was for Smith.Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 26. Celestina takes a trip to the Hebrides where she writes poetry and watches her friend's husband die in a shipwreck, mimicking an illustration Thomas Stothard made for the fifth edition of the Sonnets.Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 21–23. This section of the novel is particularly redolent with autobiographical references, with Benjamin Smith, Smith's husband, represented by Elphinstone, in a portrait that partially redeems him after his portrayal as Mr. Stafford in Emmeline.Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 25. In her heroising of the author figure, Smith was helping to create Romanticism.Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 29. ThemesAristocracy and Enlightenment= Celestina is a satire of the accepted “definition of nobility as inherited rank”; for example, Matilda Willoughby, who marries Molyneux for his title, is skewered. The only character content with his rank is Lord Castlenorth—and he is senile.Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 12. In contrast, Smith writes of the heroine: Instead of being ashamed of her illegitimacy, Celestina prides herself on her valuable mind and body. Relying on the new idea of Enlightenment, found in the works of authors such as Rousseau and Voltaire, Smith \\"asserts the value of the small individual life and its rights to the pursuit of happiness\\".Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 18. Celestina's actions, as related by the narrator, are models for young readers—and they are liberating. She is \\"confident\\", \\"socially assured\\", \\"articulate\\", and \\"decisive\\". As Fletcher explains, “Smith's feminine model is as independent as possible for an unmarried young woman in the middle or upper class who wished to remain socially acceptable.”Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 19. =Sensibility= Jane Austen criticises the hero of sensibility in Sense and Sensibility by reimagining Smith's Willougby. Within the first two volumes of the novel, there are two embedded narratives—the stories of Jessy and Sophy. Similar in tone and theme, these tales contain “family problems and bereavements, love, poverty and isolation”. These two narratives suggest that “the truth of feeling [is] the only valid and useful bond of society”.Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 15. Jessy, Sophy, and Celestina are heroines of sensibility—characters who feel strongly and are sympathetic to the emotions of others. Willoughby is a hero of sensibility, feeling more strongly than any of the female characters. Unusually in Celestina, it is the women who show more \\"fortitude\\", while the men are often prey to their emotions. Yet it is only the characters capable of feeling true emotion who are moral; those who cannot feel or suffer are incapable of moral good.Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 15–16. Jane Austen, who avidly read Smith's novels, responded to Celestina with Sense and Sensibility (begun in the 1790s) and her own Willoughby. As a teenager Austen wrote parodies of heroes of sensibility, particularly those who focused on their own feelings and ignored their familial duties.Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 38–39. Austen's novel parallels Smith's in its structure and setting: both are set primarily in Devonshire and London, for example, both have a heroine who writes an ill-advised letter to a lover. Fletcher notes that \\"the party scenes are so similar it is fair to assume that Austen initially intended a recognisable critique of Smith's [novel]\\".Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 40. However, while Smith's Willoughby is exculpated from any wrongdoing, Austen's is not—her novel rejects the hero of sensibility, critiquing his \\"moodiness\\" and \\"abuse of hospitality\\".Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 41. =Radicalism and the French Revolution= The last volume of the novel is decidedly political. Written as the Revolution Controversy was unfolding and begun five weeks after the storming of the Bastille, the novel reveals the tyranny of the ancien regime through Celestina's backstory.Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 11. As the old aristocratic order is demolished in France, the expectation builds in the reader that such an occurrence needs to take place in England as well. Publication and reception Charlotte Turner Smith by George Romney Celestina was published in four volumes in 1791 by Thomas Cadell, who had previously published Smith's Elegiac Sonnets, Emmeline, and Ethelinde. Cadell had become her friend and mentor, but he was averse to the radical views expressed in her works and refused to publish her next two novels, Desmond (1792) and The Old Manor House (1793).Fletcher, \\"Introduction\\", 11, note 3. Celestina eventually ran to four English editions and a French translation, Celestine, ou la Victime des Préjugés, appeared in 1795. The novel was not published again in English until the Broadview Press edition of 2004.Fletcher, \\"A Note on the Text\\", 51. Celestina was generally well received by reviewers, who praised its landscape descriptions.Appendix A, 543. The reviewer for the European Magazine wrote that \\"if to delight the imagination by correct and brilliant descriptions of picturesque scenery, and to awaken the finest sympathies of the heart by well-formed representations of soft distress, be a test of excellence in novel-writing, the pen of Mrs. Smith unquestionably deserves the warmest praise.\\"Appendix A, 544. The reviewer for The Critical Review praised her characterisation and noted that some characters seemed to be drawn from real life.Appendix A, 546–47.

The scheme is operated by Scottish and Southern Energy (SSE) and was opened on 29 June 2009 by Queen Elizabeth, accompanied by the Duke of Edinburgh. Scheme details Glendoe's 600 m head (the drop from the reservoir to the turbine) is the highest of any hydro electric scheme in the United Kingdom, and is thus ideally suited to generating large amounts of energy from the stored water in the reservoir, especially when combined with the relatively high annual rainfall in the area of around 2,000 mm. The Andritz six-jet vertical axis Pelton turbine at Glendoe is capable of generating up to 100 MW, with a peak flow of 18.6m³/s. It is the largest of Scotland's recent civil engineering projects, with Hochtief as the design and build contractor. The scheme is predicted to produce about 180 GWh of electricity per year, enough to provide approximately 5% of the electricity consumption of the city of Glasgow. This gives an overall load factor of approximately 20%. The immediate catchment of 15 km² is supplemented by a further 60 km² connected to the scheme by an underground network of pipes and tunnels, and this is fed into the reservoir on the upper reaches of the River Tarff. The dam, a 905-metre-long concrete- faced rock-filled embankment reaching a height of 35 metres above the valley floor, is hidden from view from all current houses and public roads in the area. The scheme includes a number of tunnels. An 8.6 km tunnel brings water from diversion intakes to the reservoir. An 8 km long 5m diameter tunnel carries the water to the turbine and out into Loch Ness. This was excavated by a 220m long tunnel boring machine (TBM), that was named \\"Eliza Jane\\" after a competition for local schoolchildren. Finally, an access tunnel of 1.3 km in length services the turbine and power station cavern, from the B862 above Fort Augustus. The power station itself, 2 km from Loch Ness and containing the turbine and generator units, is housed in a large cavern a quarter of a kilometre below the hillside, adjacent to a smaller cavern containing the main transformer. =Station shutdown= In August 2009 the station was shut down and the power tunnel drained because of internal rock falls near the head of the tunnel. Although the equipment in the power station was not affected, Glendoe was unable to generate power until repairs were made. SSE reported that electricity generation was unlikely to proceed until well into 2012. The repairs involved construction of a bypass tunnel and a downstream access tunnel. The contract for the repair work was awarded to BAM Nuttall. SSE issued proceedings seeking to recover £130 million in repair and reinstatement costs and £65 million in alleged loss of profit from Hochtief, who constructed the original tunnel, but in a Judgment (Opinion) published in December 2016 Hochtief was held by the Scottish Court of Session not to have been liable for the collapse. In an appeal decided in 2018, SSE were awarded more than £107 million in compensation. The judges hearing the appeal split 2-1 in SSE's favour. Energy generation at the scheme restarted in August 2012.

History  The five locomotives were delivered to the LDE in 1848 and 1849 by Borsig of Berlin. They were given the names ELBE, BERLIN, MULDE, MEISSEN and HAYN. The engines were retired in 1868/69.  Technical features  The boiler was rivetted from several sections. The outer firebox was equipped with a semi-circular dome that extended forward over the boiler barrel and acted as a steam collection space. In addition there was a steam dome on the front section of the boiler. The two spring balance safety valves were located on the steam dome and dome of the outer firebox. The steam cylinders were located externally, unlike those on English locomotives, which avoided the need for a cranked axle that would have been expensive and difficult to manufacture. The steam engine was equipped with inside Borsig double valve gear driven via two eccentric cams. The locomotives did not have their own braking equipment. Braking could only be achieved using the hand- operated screw brake on the tender. The locomotives had Kirchweger condensers to pre-heat the feedwater. An external feature of that is the second chimney on the tender. Exhaust steam was led from the steam chest to the tender through a low-down, 100 mm, connecting pipe.

The works, made in 1888 when Van Gogh lived in Arles, in southern France, represent a melding of formal and creative aspects. Van Gogh used a perspective frame that he built and used in The Hague to create precise lines and angles when portraying perspective. Van Gogh was influenced by Japanese woodcut prints, as evidenced by his simplified use of color to create a harmonious and unified image. Contrasting colors, such as blue and yellow, were used to bring a vibrancy to the works. He painted with an impasto, or thickly applied paint, using color to depict the reflection of light. The subject matter, a drawbridge on a canal, reminded him of his homeland in the Netherlands. He asked his brother Theo to frame and send one of the paintings to an art dealer in the Netherlands. The reconstructed Langlois Bridge is now named Pont Van-Gogh. BackgroundArles= Van Gogh was 35 when he made the Langlois Bridge paintings and drawings. Living in Arles, in southern France, he was at the height of his career, producing some of his best work:Morton, 177-178. sunflowers, fields, farmhouses and people of the Arles, Nîmes and Avignon areas.Arfin, 37. It was a prolific time for Van Gogh: in less than 15 monthsShoham, 142. he made about 100 drawings, produced more than 200 paintings and wrote more than 200 letters. The canals, drawbridges, windmills, thatched cottages and expansive fields of the Arles countryside reminded Van Gogh of his life in the Netherlands. Arles brought him the solace and bright sun that he sought for himself and conditions to explore painting with more vivid colors, intense color contrasts and varied brushstrokes. He also returned to the roots of his artistic training from the Netherlands, most notably with the use of a reed pen for his drawings.Silverman, 60—61. =Langlois Bridge= The original drawbridge, 1902. It was replaced by a reinforced-concrete bridge in 1930. At Van Gogh's time, it was called Pont de Langlois, Langlois' bridge, after its bridge keeper. The bridge has been relocated and renamed Pont Van-Gogh The Langlois Bridge was one of the crossings over the Arles to Bouc canal.Silverman, 69. It was built in the first half of the 19th century to expand the network of canals to the Mediterranean Sea. Locks and bridges were built, too, to manage water and road traffic. Just outside Arles, the first bridge was the officially titled \\"Pont de Réginel\\" but better known by the keeper's name as \\"Pont de Langlois\\".Silverman, 59. In 1930, the original drawbridge was replaced by a reinforced concrete structure which, in 1944, was blown up by the retreating Germans who destroyed all the other bridges along the canal except for the one at Fos-sur-Mer, a port on the Mediterranean Sea. The Fos Bridge was dismantled in 1959 with a view to relocating it on the site of the Langlois Bridge but as a result of structural difficulties, it was finally reassembled at Montcalde Lock several kilometers away from the original site. According to letters to his brother Theo, Van Gogh began a study of women washing clothes near the Langlois Bridge about mid-March 1888 and was working on another painting of the bridge about April 2. This was the first of several versions he painted of the Langlois Bridge that crossed the Arles canal. Reflecting on Van Gogh's works of the Langlois Bridge Debora Silverman, author of the book Van Gogh and Gauguin: The Search for Sacred Art comments, \\"Van Gogh's depictions of the bridge have been considered a quaint exercise in nostalgia mingled with Japonist allusions.\\" Van Gogh approached the making of the paintings and drawings about the bridge in a \\"serious and sustained manner\\" with attention to \\"the structure, function, and component parts of this craft mechanism in the landscape.\\"Silverman, 69-74. =Perspective frame= In Arles Van Gogh began using again a perspective frame he had built in The Hague. The device was used for outdoor sightings to compare the proportion of items that were near to those that were in the distance. Some of the works of the Langlois Bridge were made with the aid of the frame. Its use \\"deepened his exploration of the drawbridge as a mechanism.\\"Silverman, 62, 63, 74, 75 =Japanese influence= The Langlois Bridge reminded Van Gogh of Hiroshige's print Sudden Shower on the Great Bridge.Mancoff, 61. Inspired by the Japanese wood block prints, Van Gogh sought to integrate techniques from Japanese artwork into his own. In a letter to Émile Bernard about the Langlois Bridge, he wrote: \\"If the Japanese are not making any progress in their own country, still it cannot be doubted that their art is being continued in France.\\" With a Japanese aesthetic, Van Gogh's Langlois Bridge paintings reflect a simplified use of color to create a harmonious and unified image. Outlines were used to suggest movement. He used fewer shades of colors, preferring multiple subtle color variations. The Langlois Bridge reminded Van Gogh of Hiroshige's Sudden Shower on the Great Bridge inspiring him to use blocks of colors, like patterns of yellow against a blue sky, colors chosen to create a sense of vitality of the Japanese prints and the vibrant quality of light in southern France.Silverman, 61. These approaches created a more powerful impact and depicted the simpler, primitive quality of the country lifestyle.Maurer, 63. Three paintings with similar compositions The Langlois Bridge at Arles with Women Washing is one of van Gogh's most iconic and best loved paintings, acknowledged as the first masterpiece of his Arles period.Hulsker (1986), 308 It depicts common canal- side activities. A little yellow cart crosses the bridge while a group of women in smocks and multicoloured caps wash linen on the shore. Van Gogh skillfully uses his knowledge of color theory and the \\"law of simultaneous contrasts\\"Fell, 64. in this work. The grass is depicted with alternating brush strokes of red-orange and green. Yellow and blue complementary colors are used in the bridge, sky and river. Use of complementary colors intensifies the impact of each color creating a \\"vibrant and coloristically unified whole.\\" Naomi Mauer, author of The Pursuit of Spiritual Wisdom: The Thought and Art of Vincent van Gogh and Paul Gauguin describes Van Gogh's technical and artistic execution of this painting. > \\"Compositionally, the vertical and horizontal geometry of the bridge and its > reflection in the water create a great central cross which imparts a > classical symmetry and equilibrium to the canvas. This central geometric > framework, which is echoed and enclosed by the bands of sky above and the > bank below, is relieved and enlivened by the great undulating sweep of the > hill and shore, the round knot of washerwomen amid the circular ripples of > the water, and the flexible, slightly curved grasses at the right. Both > formally and chromatically, the Bridge of Langlois demonstrates Vincent's > abstraction of nature to its essential coloristic and formal elements, and > his creation from these components of a harmoniously interwoven unity in > which humanity and its works are perfectly integrated.\\"Maurer, 64. For The Langlois Bridge at Arles (watercolor) Van Gogh manages to create precise details of the bridge, such as the hardware, iron supports, braces and chain pulleys with watercolor.Silverman, 74.

The grass and the path in the foreground were painted rapidly. The bridge, though, was painted in greater detail,Silverman, 71-75 with clearly defined stone piers and wooden beams. The detail in the ropes used to lift the roadway show that they are attached to the wooden lifting gear. Van Gogh also pays close attention to the reflection of the bridge in the water. In the distance is another drawbridge. Van Gogh claimed the painting as \\"something funny... I will not create every day.\\"Hulsker, 308. There was something about the setting for this painting that reminded him of his homeland.Silverman, 71. He asked his brother Theo to frame an earlier version of the painting in blue and gold (blue in the front, gold on the side) and offer it to an art-dealer in the Netherlands, named Tersteeg.Naifeh, Smith (2011), 578 Tersteeg knew Van Gogh and his brother Theo when they lived in The Hague. He nurtured Van Gogh's early artistic interests but their relationship suffered after Van Gogh lived with a prostitute named Sien. The Van Gogh Museum claims that the painting is the last in a series of three, yet Silverman has identified four oil paintings and a fifth watercolor, as outlined in this article. =The Langlois Bridge at Arles= Wallraf-Richartz Museum's Langlois Bridge at Arles depicts a woman holding an umbrella as she crosses the Langlois Bridge, following a horse and buggy that just crossed the bridge. The water in the canal subtly reflects the bridge and the few clouds in the sky. Van Gogh uses impasto paint and color to reflect light, much as we would see it in with our eye. Two tall cypress trees and a white house flank the drawbridge which has a moveable center section between stone abutments.Perkowitz, 121. The painting is currently at the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne, Germany.

His request was generated by an interest to return to foundational drawing practices, such as his use of a perspective frame for the drawings and paintings that he made of Langlois Bridge.Silverman, 61-64. A letter dated March 18, 1888, to his friend Émile Bernard contains a sketch of the bridge (JH 1370 below) and the color scheme he is considering adopting, clearly showing his use of sketching and drawing as a preliminary to his painting. He spoke of how the town (Arles) \\"projects the strange silhouette of its drawbridge against a huge yellow sun.\\" File:Vincent Willem van Gogh letter sketch.jpgLanglois Bridge near Arles (Sketch from letter to Émile Bernard), March 1888, J.

Clarke made reference to Van Gogh's Bridge at Arles in his novel 2001: A Space Odyssey. In it, the character David Bowman notices the painting (along with Andrew Wyeth's Christina's World) when observing the living room of \\"an elegant, anonymous hotel suite\\" after travelling through the Stargate. The painting did not appear in the movie. Argentine musician Luis Alberto Spinetta referenced the painting in \\"Cantata de puentes amarillos\\" (Spanish for \\"Cantata of yellow bridges\\"), one of his most celebrated songs. Spinetta came to Van Gogh's letters to Theo through his reading of the essay Van Gogh, The Man Suicided by Antonin Artaud. The track is the centerpiece of his 1973 record Artaud, named after the poet, which is generally considered the greatest album in Argentine rock history. The painting is also featured on the 30th season of The Amazing Race, where as part of the detour challenge, teams will find this painting, which in reality is an elaborate sliding puzzle, requiring them to slide elements of the painting in a specific sequence in order to unlock the easel and retrieve their clue inside.

It is also notable in its rejection of the concepts of quasi-property and privacy in the framework of the common law. It has been observed that the concept of property itself cannot be entirely satisfactorily explained without accounting, in some way or other, for the ruling in this case. In the 1930s, radio broadcasting in Australia challenged the monopolies of racing clubs, who exercised tight control over access to the racecourse, supported by existing laws, with minimal media reporting in the form of scores scratched on boards at the racecourse and more detailed newspaper summaries after the event. Background The plaintiff owned Victoria Park, a racing track in south Sydney, which charged admissions to people who placed bets on the races. The racecourse was surrounded by a very high fence. Taylor, who had a house and front yard adjacent to the course, allowed the radio broadcasting station 2UW to construct a five-metre high platform on scaffolding from which someone could see into the course and broadcast – with the help of binoculars – the races and information about horses posted at the ground, which facilitated unregulated off-track betting. Attendance at the ground plummeted. The Plaintiff claimed that on-track betting was lower as a result of the broadcasts, as people who had previously come to the track were now listening on the radio instead and Taylor was profiting at the expense of the plaintiff. He applied to the Supreme Court of New South Wales for an injunction against Taylor on the footing of nuisance and breach of copyright. Privacy and non-natural use of property were also cited as grounds. It was common ground that the mere construction and use of the raised platform constituted no breach of building or zoning regulations or of the betting and gaming legislation or indeed of the regulations governing broadcasting. The injunction was denied,. and the decision was appealed to the High Court. Ruling at the High Court In a 3–2 decision, the appeal was dismissed, as no wrong was committed that was known to the law. Separate opinions were issued by all justices Latham CJ, Dixon and McTiernan JJ for the majority, and Rich and Evatt JJ in dissent. :* There was no property in a spectacle. As Latham CJ noted: :* Nor could copyright be claimed in any information being posted on signs in the park: :* There was no proof that nuisance had been brought upon the race track, as McTiernan J observed: :* The Court did not recognize the existence of a legal right to privacy. As Latham CJ stated: :* Building the platform was not an unnatural use of property, as it did not breach any bylaws. Impact The case was notable for rejecting the concept of quasi-property that had been recently adopted by the United States Supreme Court in International News Service v. Associated Press,International News Service v. Associated Press, and has been influential in many common law jurisdictions in the Commonwealth. The reluctance was summarized by Dixon J thus: As to the question of privacy in Australian law, the High Court subsequently declared in ABC v Lenah Game Meats Pty Ltd that Victoria Park was not a case about privacy. Rather, it was concerned with allocating the right to appropriate and control how information can be made public. (2002) 30(1) Federal Law Review 177. Aftermath Off- track betting was subsequently brought under State regulation in New South Wales by the Gaming and Betting (Amendment) Act 1938,Gaming and Betting (Amendment) Act 1938 (NSW) George VI, No. 7, 1938 and the Parliament of Australia later passed the Broadcasting and Television Act 1956,Broadcasting and Television Act 1956 (Cth) (No. 33 of 1956) prohibiting television stations (but not radio stations) from televising \\"the whole or part of a sporting event or other entertainment held in Australia … in a place in which a charge is made for admission, if the images of the sporting event or other entertainment originate from the use of equipment outside that place\\". Radio stations were not included, as they had previously reached an agreement on the matter with the racecourse owners.

An initial layer of litter is spread for the animals to use for bedding material and to defecate in, and as the litter is soiled, new layers of litter are continuously added by the farmer. In this fashion, a deep litter bedding can build up to depths of 1–2 meters.Groenestein & Van Faassen, 1996 - Volatilization of Ammonia, Nitrous Oxide and Nitric Oxide in Deep-litter Systems for Fattening Pigs. J. agric. Engng Res. vol. 65, pp269 – 274 \\"The usual procedure for built-up floor litter is to start with about 4 inches of fine litter material with additions of 1 to 2 inches later as needed without removal of the old. A depth of 6 to 12 inches is maintained by partial removals from time to time.\\" (Plamondon) Many consider this to be a natural means to disposing of animal feces. “The deep litter cultivation is a modern ecological breeding technique based on decomposing feces by microbiological methods, a post processing method for poultry Manure.”  History  The deep litter method was first used in 1946 by the Ohio Station Brooder House. Before the deep litter method, shavings were removed every one to two weeks, in order to avoid dampness and coccidia. Later, it was discovered that deep litter provides adequate protection from these naturally. The deeper litter provides extra insulation in colder temperatures, as well as extra heat from the decomposition of the litter. Another potential benefit is that when raised under conditions that don't provide adequate nutrition, deep litter poultry is healthier than poultry raised in the traditional method of housing. \\"By not removing the waste, good microbes come and make their homes in the litter. These microbes actually eat and break down the feces and consume unhealthy bacteria, leaving good bacteria behind.\\" (Natural Chicken Keeping)  Benefits  Numerous benefits have been discovered with the use of the deep litter system, also called the “build-up method”. One is the increased ability of poultry to fight off coccidia, common bacteria responsible for an average of a 20% death rate of poultry. New studies in Ohio have shown death rates from coccidia as low as 2.9%. As many as 6 successive broods of chicks have been raised on the same litter, each brood showing better results. Chickens raised in this environment have also been less inclined to show cannibalistic traits. (Plamondon) Many studies have been done in order to research potential advantages and disadvantages of the deep litter system. This research covers multiple types of livestock including poultry, swine, duck, and cattle. \\"The first experimental evidence with reference to the user of built-up litter as a sanitary procedure was secured by the Ohio Station in 1946 when it was first used in the brooder house. During the three years previous when the floor litter was removed and renewed at frequent intervals, the average mortality of 10 broods, or a total of 18,000 chicks, was 19 percent. During the succeeding three years with the use of built-up litter, the average mortality of 11 broods, or a total of 10,000 chicks, was 7 percent. Seldom did a brood escape an attack of coccidiosis before the use of built-up litter. Afterward there was no noticeable trouble from coccidiosis in 11 consecutive broods started and raised on the same old built-up floor litter. Old built-up litter is floor litter which has been used by two or more previous broods of chicks.\\" (Plamondon) To build immunity against coccidia, chicks are normally vaccinated. Experiments have shown that deep litter is an effective method of exposing chicks to the bacteria at a safe rate. Chicken feces produces ammonia which is known for killing coccidia. “a 10 percent solution of ammonia spray is considered effective for killing coccidia. Being unable to withstand such a spray, they may likewise be unable to withstand the constant ammoniacal atmosphere in built-up litter.” (Plamondon) Experiments have shown major potential benefits to utilizing the deep litter method, specifically within piggeries. Pigs raised in a deep litter system, do significantly better than pigs raised under similar conditions, on a concrete floor, which is the traditional method. Studies have shown that pigs raised in a deep litter system have a lower feed to gain ratio, produce a higher quality of pork, create a significantly lower amount of gaseous emissions, show improvements in odor nuisance reduction, and have better animal welfare. “Pigs in the deep litter system had greater color score and rate of cooking meat, while they had lower drip loss and cooking loss than loins from concrete-floor system housed pigs.” (ZHOU et al. 426) “Results indicate that pigs raised in the deep-litter system had some animal welfare improvements and an odor nuisance reduction; in the meantime, pork quality also improved from the deep-litter system compared to the pigs housed in the concrete-floor system.” (ZHOU, abstract) Gaseous emissions were also lower within the deep litter system when compared to traditional systems. \\"NH3 concentration in the deep-litter system was significantly lower than that in the concrete-floor system\\" (ZHOU et al. 425) “deep litter and outdoor production avoids the large quantities of methane normally generated from effluent ponds in conventional piggeries” (Ian Kruger Consulting, 2) This study helped to prove numerous benefits not only to our atmosphere, but to the health and animal welfare of the pigs.  Negative effects  A study was conducted to determine the effects on the reproductive system caused by different living styles, for poultry. The deep litter system provided lower efficiency in terms of reproduction, and an increase of food intake “feed intake was lower (p < 0.05) in legumes and green pasture than deep litter suggesting economic benefit. It was concluded that access to legumes enhanced the performance of layers compared to deep litter and green pasture as indicated by the parameters measured.” (Oke, Abstract) This particular study determined that the deep litter method was not beneficial in terms of egg layer production in chickens. A study was conducted in three intensive duck farms in China that utilised routine prophylactic antibiotics. This attempted to determine the ability for antibiotic resistant bacteria, to accumulate in meat duck deep litter where the ducks would subsequently excrete the antibiotics and heavy metals from growth promoters and feeds into the litter. Levels were measured at 3 different stages of duck life, in 3 different barns. The litter contained high levels of antibiotics and heavy metals that corresponded to the antibiotics, feed and supplements that the ducks received throughout their growth cycle. “E. coli isolated from the 3 stages of sampling were highly resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, florfenicol, and doxycycline. Increased resistance to ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, ofloxacin, and gentamicin were seen in the isolates from the final stage of deep litter.” (Linn, Abstract) This study concluded that \\"deep litter could be suitable for the evolution of bacterial antibiotic-resistance under conditions of continuous usage or accumulation of antibiotics and heavy metals without proper management.” (Linn, Abstract) This paper highlights the risk of introducing the routine use of antibiotics, growth promoting supplements and pesticides rather than a direct contribution of deep litter systems. This paper did not utilise a control environment that avoided growth promoters or routine antibiotics. Problems may arise from the deep litter method such as rotten bed. This occurs mostly in piggeries, and is caused by high levels of water intake and discharge from the animals, as well as discharging in the same location within the pen. The build-up of moisture cannot be absorbed quickly enough to fully decompose and causes rotting, unpleasant odors, and harmful gases. Experiments to solve this problem have taken place. One process, is called the heat pulse method. This method, refers to heating the bedding at a constant temperature, which causes a buildup of steam beneath the bedding. However, the steam is unable to release itself, so the next step is to pulse oxygen into the bedding, allowing the steam to escape. “The pulse method could promote the timely discharge of steam generated inside the bedding.” (Li, 1412)  Innovations  This type of farming has created a new market for sheds specifically designed to utilize the deep litter method. Companies are realizing that this method has multiple benefits and is being accepted by various governments as a greener method of farming. “It has won the support of the government and acceptance of market.” (QIN, 1) One type of building being constructed is called the removable deep litter breeding shed. It consists of larger areas for the animals, space to let the litter build to heights not allowed by traditional housing, and economic costs compared to traditional sheds. “Successful exploiture of breeding supporting facilities will greatly promote the development of deep-litter breeding technology in local farms.” (QIN, 1)  External links  * http://www.the-chicken- chick.com/2013/10/the-deep-litter-method-of-waste.html * http://naturalchickenkeeping.blogspot.com/p/deep-litter-method.html References Category:Livestock ","title":"Deep litter"},{"id":"21717500","text":"Te Aroha Keenan is a New Zealand former netball coach and member of the Silver Ferns in the 1980s.

The aim of the organisation is to achieve an equitable and sustainable healthy environment for all. WECF is a network of more than 150 women's and environmental organisations in 50 countries worldwide. WECF also works on national, European, UN and international political levels with the aim to increase women's influence in political decision-making processes.  Herstory  WECF was officially registered as a foundation in 1994 in the Netherlands as Women in Europe for a Common Future. During the “Earth Summit” in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 1992 women from the European region came together to create the network WECF because they recognized the catalysing role women play in sustainable development as defined in the United Nation’s report “Our Common Future.” WECF's philosophy has always been to ensure that the voices of women and marginalized groups are heard at the policy table and to combine this with local actions in which they realize their priorities. This dual action-advocacy approach has become one of the strongest distinguishing aspects of our network. The staff from WECF Germany posing in front of the #munich4Europe statue as part of the \\"make Europe sustainable for all\\" campaign 2018.  Aim & vision  WECF believes that a sustainable future and environment needs holistic solutions reflecting the lives of people on the ground. They implement feminist solutions based on their partners’ visions and needs. They work to achieve transformative gender equality and full realization of women’s human rights in interconnection with climate justice, sustainable energy & chemicals, less toxic waste, safe water & sanitation for all.  Key issues  WECF works on the intersections of gender equality in the following three areas: * Sustainable development - WECF works towards the full realisation of human rights, development justice and the right to a healthy environment for all, regardless of gender, age, race, sexual identity, education, religion, ability or socioeconomic status. They want a sustainable future in which polluters and governments are held accountable and where human rights, health and the environment have priority over trade agreement and other economic interests. * Climate action - WECF mobilizes people towards climate justice and they demonstrate how you can ensure human rights and gender equality when implementing the Paris Agreement. They support local community groups to create sustainable energy funds and cooperatives, while advancing gender equality and women’s leadership. They engage in global climate negotiations with their local partners, sharing replicable best practices and opposing false climate actions such as nuclear and fossil fuels. * Toxic free healthy environment - WECF demands justice for victims of pollution from chemicals, nuclear radiation and other sources, and measures to protect environmental human rights defenders. They promote toxic- free and non-chemical alternatives based on the principles formulated at the Earth Summit in Rio 1992: the polluter pays, reversal of the burden of proof, the precautionary principle and principle 10 to ensure public participation, transparency and access justice.  Approach  From local to the global, WECF takes a three-pronged approach to mobilise for sustainable and equitable change: * Capacity-building - WECF trains, provide expertise, and offer grants to women and gender equality organisations. Thus supporting them in their work for climate justice, an environmentally sustainable future and gender justice. * Policy - WECF advocates to policymakers, from the local to the global-level, to include gender equality and women’s perspectives in policies and implementation plans. They do this by supporting their partners’ participation in decision-making processes, by leading regional and international gender equality movements, and by monitoring policies. * Outreach - WECF campaigns to increase awareness on the importance of gender-just climate and environmental solutions. With their partners they host social media campaigns, e.g. #FeministDemand, and send open letters to decision-makers. They also give small grants to partners and organise public debates, street actions and award-celebrations.  United Nations  WECF has observer status with the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations (ECOSOC) and is an official partner of the United Nations Environment Program (UNEP). WECF is also a member of the European Environment and Health Committee (EEHC). They are also a partner to Women's Major Group and Women & Gender Constituency. WECF at the 2012 UN Rio+20 summit on sustainable development More than 50,000 representatives of social movements and civil society organisations took to the streets in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012, to demonstrate against unfair and unsustainable economic policies. At the same time, 30,000 participants of the United Nations Rio+20 conference contributed to the document \\"The Future We Want\\" which set the path for the Sustainable Development Goals (replacing the Millennium Development Goals). WECF took a leading role in the 2012 Rio+20 conference, as co-facilitator of the Women’s Major Group, one of the nine groups of civil society which have a space in the UN policy process, and are allotted speaking time and contribute to the proposed negotiation text. WECF's role was to facilitate the 300 organisations through virtual and face to face meetings, develop joint text proposals for the negotiation text, organise meetings with country negotiators, as well as organising events in which to present the priorities of women's organisations.  Organisation  The organisation was founded by Marie Kranendonk in 1994. Now WECF has five offices in the Netherlands, Germany, France, Switzerland and Georgia. WECF has a dual governance system. The formal supervision of the executive directors and their team is done by the Board of Trustees (BOT). Their role is to approve the annual plans, budgets and reports, and supervise the work of WECF's directors. WECF's partners also have a say in their governance, through the International Advisory Board (IAB). The IAB's role is to give strategic advice to WECF's BOT and directors. The IAB is also crucial for the development of common funding, advocacy and campaigning strategies.1 References External links  * * WaterWiki about WECF __FORCETOC__ Category:International women's organizations Category:Sustainability organizations Category:International organisations based in the Netherlands Category:International organizations based in Europe Category:Environmental justice Category:Gender equality Category:Ecofeminism Category:Sustainable development ","title":"Women Engage for a Common Future"},{"id":"21717542","text":"Dah Chong Hong Building in Kowloon Bay, Kowloon A DCH Food Mart Store in Happy Valley, Hong Kong agent of Honda Civic Car in Hong Kong and Macau Dah Chong Hong Holdings Limited (DCH) () () is a Hong Kong-based conglomerate engaged in motor vehicle sales and repair, air cargo equipment distribution, cosmetic, airport ground support equipment maintenance, food, logistics and warehouse services.Dah Chong Hong Holdings Limited  History  *1949: DCH was established, formerly Hang Chong Investment Company Limited () and Dah Chong Hong Limited ().Dah Chong Hong Holdings Limited Dah Chong Hong Holdings Limited *1970: Started U.S. Automotive Business in late 1970s and continue to focus on becoming a Great Prosperous Company (Dah Chong Hong). *1991: CITIC Pacific first acquired an approximately 34.86% interest in the company which was an unlisted public company. *1992: CITIC Pacific further acquired the remaining interest in the company making it a wholly owned subsidiary of CITIC Pacific and changed the company’s status from a public company to a private company.RELATIONSHIP WITH CITIC PACIFICHISTORY AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT *1994: The company was renamed \\"Dah Chong Hong Holdings Limited\\". *2007: The company was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.Dah Chong Hong to issue 781.2 mln shrs at 4.55-5.88 hkd each in HK IPO DCH Food Mart Its operating company, DCH Food Mart is one of the leading food retailers in Hong Kong established in 1992.Profile of DCH Food MartChina's Leading Food Distributor to Implement Ross Enterprise to Help Ensure Food Safety Compliance and Improve Operational EfficiencyHong Kong-based DCH to ensure food safety with CDC apps It provides various frozen seafood, meat, poultry, dried seafood and basic groceries sourced globally.

It is situated where the eastern part of Edgware meets the western part of Mill Hill and centres on the small retail centre at the junction of Deans Lane, Hale Lane and Selvage Lane. This centre constitutes Upper Hale, but is much better known locally as the 'Green Man' after the erstwhile pub of the same name that stood at the site from at least the early 18th century. A smaller area that was traditionally known as Lower Hale centres on the junction of Hale Lane, Farm Road and the nearby bridge over Deans Brook; this latter area is generally regarded as being within Edgware. The traditional area known as The Hale extends northwards from the 'Green Man' to the A41 and Apex Corner and the southern end is traditionally marked by the disused Edgware and Highgate railway line just south of West Way and Hale Drive; beyond lies Burnt Oak. Today's borough ward has slightly larger boundaries. History The Hale was a rural area until well into the 20th century, with only the Green Man pub and the Railway Tavern (still in existence today) on opposite corners, as well as farms at Upper Hale and Lower Hale. The Green Man pub was somewhat famous in the 19th century, including for sports such as boxing. The pub was totally rebuilt as it is today in the late 1920s, but eventually became Everglades (a Tex-Mex restaurant) in the late 1980s and has since become a Harvester Inn. At the turn of the 20th century, The Hale was a popular place for day-trippers from Central London who frequented the two public houses. The area changed quickly with rapid development in the late 1920s and early 1930s, particularly triggered by the arrival of the Northern line to Edgware station in 1924, and the consequent introduction of omnibus services from that station to The Hale and Mill Hill. The farms at Upper Hale and Lower Hale were sold and developed for residential housing, such as the Hale Estate (based around the east side of Selvage Lane, Sunbury Avenue, Sunbury Gardens and Maxwelton Avenue) in the late 1920s. Thus, since the early 1930s The Hale has been a suburban area generally characterised by private detached and semi-detached houses. A notable building in The Hale is a church named in honour of John Keble. It a Grade II-listed modernist-style building which was completed in 1936. Another significant building is Maxwelton House - recently discovered during renovations to be one of the oldest buildings in the larger Edgware and Mill Hill area - which is now a school building on Hale Lane. In 1932, the John Grooms Crippleage was opened just south of the A41 Edgware Way near Stoneyfields Lane; this was closed in the 1980s and replaced by modern private housing. GeographyTransport The Hale was formerly served by Mill Hill (The Hale) railway station on Bunns Lane from 1906 until it shut in 1939. Its immediate neighbour, Mill Hill Broadway railway station, is the nearest station today, within a short walking distance. The Hale is directly served by London Buses routes 221, 240, 292 and 303 - and routes 113, 186 and Uno route 614 serve the A41 at the north end of the district. All of these routes also serve Edgware station on the Northern line, which remains the other main route to and from the area. At various times 'Mill Hill Green Man ' was itself a terminal point for buses, most famously the 52 from Victoria from the early 1930s until the construction of the M1 and the then new bus station at Mill Hill Broadway, to where the 52 was diverted in 1967.

The song peaked at No. 41 on the Billboard Hot 100, charting less successfully then the previous two singles. Nevertheless, \\"Rock and Roll Never Forgets\\" remains popular with Seger fans, and has become a staple of classic rock radio. Background According to Seger, he wrote this song after attending a high school reunion. \\"I wanted to just write an honest appraisal of where I was at that moment in time,\\" he said. \\"I was 31 years old and I was damn glad to be here.\\" The song is accompanied by a mid-tempo sound and Seger's signature raspy vocals. The song is about aging and the ongoing power of rock music. The song advices the 31 year old listener to return to the rock 'n' roll she loved when she was 16. The song also serves as a tribute to Chuck Berry, who is mentioned in the line \\"Well all of Chuck's children are out there playing his licks/Get into your kicks/Come back baby rock and roll never forgets.\\" Reception Rolling Stone praised the song as \\"no-bullshit, horn- slathered Silver Bullet crunch with a nod to Chuck Berry (who's name-checked in the last verse) – makes the case for rock's longevity as well as the lyrics do.\\" Billboard said that the \\"standard riffs played at intense energy levels by the rhythm section make an almost ironic counterpoint to the Van Morrison- type lyrics about the funky fun of the golden days of young rock music.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Category:Bob Seger songs Category:Songs written by Bob Seger Category:1977 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Bob Seger Category:1977 singles Category:Capitol Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Punch Andrews ","title":"Rock and Roll Never Forgets"},{"id":"21717568","text":"Karmazin may refer to : People *John Karmazin, Sr. (23 May 1884–May 1977) was an American engine component inventor and business founder. *Mel Karmazin (born August 24, 1943)[1] is an American executive. *Roman Karmazin (born January 2, 1973 in Kuznetsk) is the former IBF Light Middleweight champion of the world. *Viliam Karmažin (1922-2018), Slovak composer and conductor Enterprises *The Karmazin Products Corporation was founded in Wyandotte, Michigan during 1946 by John Karmazin, Sr. Other use *Karmazin (grape), another name for the red wine grape Blaufrankisch ","title":"Karmazin"},{"id":"21717572","text":"Gyula Németh (born 2 December 1959) is a retired Hungarian high jumper.

A Tortuga simulation can be written either as interacting processes or as scheduled events. A Tortuga simulation can have thousands of entities, and can be part of a larger Java system. License Tortuga as an open source project under the Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 (LGPLv2.1). Tortuga meets the licensing requirements by providing all source code and binary executables available for download at the primary website listed in the \\"external links\\" section below. Run-time and development environment Tortuga simulations run on Microsoft Windows XP and Windows Vista as well as on Linux, macOS, BSD and Unix. They can also be used in an applet environment, although this typically requires a signed applet. As part of its support for simulation, Tortuga employs tools from aspect-oriented programming, or AOP. You need not be familiar with AOP to use Tortuga: your simulation classes are written in standard Java. However, the use of AOP in Tortuga requires more elaborate compilation that mere javac. This has been wrapped up in an Ant task included in tortuga.jar. This task is the reason it is assumed Tortuga-based simulations are using Ant to build. Tortuga programming paradigm Tortuga utilizes a programming paradigm that greatly reduces the burden on the simulation on developer. Tortuga treats each simulation entity as a separate thread and allows the user to specify a run method. This allows the developer to focus on simulation specifics without littering event handler code all over the place. This means that a Tortuga simulation is inherently limited by the number of threads the JVM is able to support. This limit becomes an upper bound on the number of actors, and with the 1.5 Sun-based JRE the limit was about 6,000.

At the end of World War II Prohnen was a well-functioning farm with 200 head of dairy cows, a substantial stock of Trakehnen horses, Merino sheep and swine production. The farm was only possible to exist and function because of its capable workforce of 18 families that had a good and rewarding life on this estate. Eighteen members of this estate lost their lives in World War II or were taken to Russia. The owners stayed in or around Prohnen until August 1945, when they were asked to leave Poland.

His practice in Cavendish, Vermont, where Gage's accident occurred in 1848, brought Gage under his care. In 1857 he left Cavendish due to poor health, and spent three years traveling and studying in Minnesota and Philadelphia before taking up practice in Woburn, Massachusetts in 1861. His first paper on Gage appeared in Boston Medical and Surgical Journal in late 1848; a short follow-up note appeared early the next year. Almost twenty years later, in 1868, he published a final paper recounting what he had been able to learn about the subsequent history of his patient (who died in 1860), and presenting psychological changes in Gage which, presumably, were sequelae of the accident. In one of the most memorably strange examples ever of dogged long-term medical followup, Harlow, having \\"trac[ed Gage] in his wanderings over the greater part of this continent\\" (by which he meant South as well as North America, Gage having spent seven years in Chile before continuing to California) had even obtained Gage's skull for use in preparing the paper. Harlow was highly active in Woburn civic affairs, serving at various on the town's water, drainage, and schools committees, and as a library trustee; he was also a state senator and member of the Massachusetts Governor's Council, a trustee of the Massachusetts General Hospital, a bank president and director of another bank, a director of the local gas company, and a local medical official during the Civil War.American Medical Biographies, Howard Atwood Kelly and Walter Lincoln Burrage, Norman, Remington Co., 1920, p. 492 On Harlow's death in 1907 The New York Times called him \\"one of the oldest and most prominent physicians and surgeons of New England\\".

It is the first live-action Doctor Who spin-off series. The series features Caroline John as Liz Shaw, working for the Preternatural Research Bureau. Many former Doctor Who actors, including former Doctors Jon Pertwee, Peter Davison, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy, appear in the series playing different roles. (Due to licensing restrictions, no overt reference to The Doctor is permitted.) Doctor Who alumna Louise Jameson co-stars with Caroline John in the original four films, as Patricia Haggard. Originally released on VHS, the series was not widely available on video. When an interviewer commented to series author Mark Gatiss that he had never seen the series, Gatiss replied \\"No, and you never will. One, they're not available. And two, I forbid it. Christ, for all I knew, they were the only things I would ever get to make. And I learned a frightening amount from working on them.\\" The four original films were released on DVD on 3 March 2012 exclusive to Galaxy 4 shop with a 12 rating. A fifth film, written and directed by Bill Baggs, was released 20 April 2015 with Hazel Burrows taking over as Liz Shaw. In 2020 the P.R.O.B.E. series was revived by Arcbeatle Press, starting with the release of Shadows of Doubt. Under Arcbeatle Press the series made the transition to the prose format.https://www.arcbeatlepress.com/probe.html The Zero Imperative (1994) The Zero Imperative was released direct-to-video in January 1994 by BBV. =Synopsis= Former UNIT luminary Liz Shaw and her assistant Bayliss are investigating a series of bizarre murders, all committed near a soon-to- be-closed psychiatric hospital.

He has gained an increasing reputation on the Pakistani domestic set- up for quick bowling eventually leading to a call up to the international squad for the February 2009 test series against Sri Lanka.Pakistan call on youth Domestic career Relatively inexperienced at this stage but was first noticed in 2005 Afro-Asia Cup playing for the Pakistan U-19's, able to extract bounce and sharp burst of speed. However injuries limited his performance in the coming year. His performance in the 2008–09 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy gained him recognition, playing for National Bank of Pakistan alongside fellow young pace prospect Mohammad Aamer he gained his first 10-wicket haul against Pakistan Customs side, taking 10 for 119 in match. Halfway through the season he had 34 wickets in just 6 games.Talha impresses in domestic circuit January 2009 In the past few years he has worked extensively with Aaqib Javaid at the National Cricket Academy based in Karachi, where he slightly re-modified his action to avoid persistent injuries. Aaqib said of Talha that he believed him to be close to national team selection and that he was the fastest bowler in Pakistan after Shoaib Akhtar. In a recent interview Talha commented on his desire to known as a genuine fast bowler and to represent Pakistan at the highest level.Mohammad Talha interview on Pakpassion.net In the home test series against Sri Lanka in 2009, he was chosen in the 15-man squad for both the first and second test. For the first test he was overlooked for pacemen Sohail Khan and all-rounder Yasir Arafat. Early career and personal life Mohammad Talha grew up in Faisalabad, where he began playing tape ball cricket, encouraged by his elder brother. Muhammad Talha has a daughter named Rumaan. He lives in Hajia Bad. He got his early education from Government School Hajia Bab. In 2003 he went for the Under 16's trial in the Faisalabad region and got selected but admits to not having the stamina at the time for longer version of the game. He has stated that like many young Pakistani bowlers of the current era Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis were his cricketing idols whilst growing up and also added that Brett Lee too someone he try to learn from. He has modeled his bowling action on that Brett Lee's. International career Talha made his test debut against Sri Lanka on 1 March 2009. Although he failed to impress after bowling 17 overs, he gave away 88 runs and picked up the wicket of M. Muralitharan, who was batting at number 9. The match was later cancelled due to attack on the Sri Lankan team. He got a recall in the Pakistan team in 2014 to play again against Sri Lanka. This time, he bowled brilliantly and picked up 3 wickets in both the innings. He made his ODI debut against India and bowled amazingly well, picking up 2–22 in 7 overs. But proved out to be very expensive in the next two games, giving away 1–68 in 7 overs against Bangladesh and 1–56 in 6.2 overs against Sri Lanka in the final. He was a part of Pakistan's 2014 ICC World Twenty 20 tournament squad but had to sit in the bench during the whole tournament.

It interchanges with the Union Pacific Railroad (UP), as well as with BNSF Railway trains running over the UP via trackage rights. The company began operations in 1992 as a private switching railroad, and became a common carrier in 1995. It expanded operations in 2001 and 2004, and the Patriot Rail Corporation gained control in January 2008. History UCRY's first operations, which began in September 1992, were under contract to Westinghouse Electric, switching cars at the Western Zirconium Plant west of Ogden for interchange with UP and the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad (by then operating as a subsidiary of the Southern Pacific).Railroad Retirement Board, Employer Status Determination: Utah Central Railway Company In October 1995 it began common carrier service on industrial trackage in Ogden, which it acquired from the city. Here too it interchanged with both the UP and Southern Pacific, the former on its old line next to Midland Drive.STB Finance Docket No. 32502, 1995Edward A. Lewis, American Shortline Railway Guide, 5th Edition, Kalmbach Publishing, 1996, p. 319 In 2001, UCRY leased a number of Ogden-area branch lines from the UP, which had absorbed the Southern Pacific; this included the remnants of the old UP and Rio Grande main lines west of downtown Ogden. Finally, in 2004, UCRY acquired the trackage serving Business Depot Ogden from a UP connection.Don Strack, Utah Central Railway (of 1992), accessed February 2009 At one point the UCRY leased a 44-ton GE diesel and class CA-11 caboose from the Utah State Railroad Museum in Ogden, Utah. Both the locomotive and caboose were repainted in UCRY colors. When returned to the museum, the locomotive sat idle for several years. For many years, the Business Depot was served by an ex-Air Force Fairbanks-Morse H-12-44. In July 2010, the UCRY repainted their ex-Rarus Railway GP9 black with a large \\"Utah Central\\" in gold across the engine compartment, and moved it to BDO to replace the FM locomotive. Reason for this replacement is unknown; according to a Utah Central employee, the H-12-44 had only 100 running hours in 2009. In September 2010, two GP-15 diesel locomotives 1418 and 1401, refurbished from LTEX were delivered to the UCRY's headquarters at the old sugar factory. They are painted in the distinctive Patriot Rail corporate scheme (red overall with a blue stripe highlighted by gold pin stripes down the middle with an eagle on the nose).Lee Witten, , accessed September 2010 Locomotives The Utah Central was once known for its eclectic mix of second-hand locomotives. For a time no two were painted alike (excepting nos. 1418 and 1401). Some notable former examples of this are an ex-Kennecott High-Clearance GP-39 locomotive originally used in the Bingham Canyon copper pit (RARW 1010) and an ex-Rarus Railway chop-nose GP9 (UCRY 201). Currently most of the Utah Central locomotive fleet is painted in the colors of its parent Patriot Rail.

He is the father of TV journalist and science writer Piero Angela. Early life Angela was born in Olcenengo, Province of Vercelli. He graduated with a degree in medicine in 1899 at the University of Turin. In Paris he attended the Neuropsychiatry courses held by Babinski. During World War I he was an officer of the Italian Red Cross at the \\"Vittorio Emanuele III\\" Territorial Hospital of Turin. Political activity He joined politics after World War I, by joining the Democrazia Sociale movement, a political movement born from the ashes of the Partito Radicale Storico. Within the party there were many contradictions: together with left-wing deputies there were others who became ministers in the first government run by Mussolini, formed after the march on Rome. Then Angela left the party and allied with the reformist Socialists led by Ivanoe Bonomi, whom he ran with at the elections of 6 April 1924, without being elected. After the murder of Giacomo Matteotti, in June 1924, Carlo Angela openly blamed the fascists from the pages of the weekly paper Tempi Nuovi. Humanitarian actions The government's reaction to this article was to set the newspaper's office on fire and Angela fled to San Maurizio Canavese. There, he became health director of the clinic for mental diseases \\"Villa Turina Amione\\". It was there that Angela offered a safe haven to numerous antifascists and Jews during the German Occupation and the Repubblica Sociale Italiana, by forging the medical cards to justify their stay inside the clinics. He diagnosed patients incorrectly and changed names or nationalities.Anna Malvezzi \\"Carlo Angela, a 'Righteous Gentile'\\" The International Raoul Wallenberg Foundation In his rescue he was helped by Vice- Director dr. Brun, by sister Tecla and by the nurses Fiore De Stefanis, Carlo and Sante Simionato. As suspected by the fascist police, Mr. Angela was summoned and interrogated in Turin and he also ran the risk of being shot during a retaliation. After World War II During the Liberation, Carlo Angela was appointed mayor of San Maurizio Canavese. Afterwards he ran for the first democratic elections after longer than twenty years, in the same list as Norberto Bobbio, Massimo Mila and Ada Gobetti Marchesini. He also became the President of the Molinette hospital in Turin. He was initiated in Freemasonry since 1905. where he was conferred of the 33 degree of the Scottish Rite. After the end of the Second World War, he became Grand Master of the Lodge \\"Propaganda\\" of Turin until his death, and President of the Grand Master Council of the same city. He died in 1949. On 8 June it was afforded the related ritual in the Temple of \\"Propaganda\\"..  Medal of \\"Righteous among the Nations\\"  The necessary requirements for a man to be acknowledged as a \\"Righteous\\" are three: saving Jews, doing so under the threat of a serious life risk, and never getting any reward for this. The deeds of Angela remained unknown for more than 25 years because of his family's reserve, and were only revealed in 1995, when Anna Segre decided to publish the diary of her father Renzo, written during the time when he had escaped the extermination camps together with his wife Nella in the clinic \\"Villa Turina Amione\\"Renzo Segre, Venti mesi [Twenty Months] (Sellerio: Palermo 1995). Based on the evidence and the testimonies collected and presented to it, on 29 August 2001 an Israeli committee awarded Professor Angela the Medal as a Righteous among the Nations and inserted his name into the Garden of the Righteous at the Yad Vashem museum in Jerusalem: the awarding ceremony took place in San Maurizio Canavese on 25 April 2002.Carlo Angela – his activity to save Jews' lives during the Holocaust, at Yad Vashem website The Adviser of the Israeli Embassy in Rome, Tibor Schlosser, in the name of the world's Jewish community as a whole, assigned the award to Sandra and Piero, Carlo Angela's children.

The film follows the story of two Italian brothers who emigrate to America and find work as set designers for D.W. Griffith's silent film epic Intolerance (1916). The French-Italian co-production was screened out of competition at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival. It was a critical and financial hit in its native country, winning a Nastro d'Argento for Best Costume Design with an additional nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Plot Two Tuscan brothers, Nicola and Andrea Bonanno, come from a long line of artisans and church restorers. In 1911, they find themselves out of work without any real prospects. Hoping to find their fortunes elsewhere, they emigrate to the United States. Initially forced into precarious jobs, the two young man manage to find work in the Italian emigrant neighborhood of San Francisco. Thanks to their talent and with a bit of luck, they find themselves in the employ of film director D. W. Griffith, who is overseeing preproduction of his historical epic Intolerance and is looking for Italian-born set designers. The brothers find themselves working on the film's elaborate Babylonian period setpieces, while falling in love with two young extras; Edna and Mabel, whom they eventually marry. Life, however, soon turns bitter for the brothers after Edna dies in childbirth. Rather than uniting the brothers, the tragedy only divides them. Later on in World War I, Nicola and Andrea will meet and the camera, used by the army for military purposes, will be the dramatic witness of the epilogue of their lives.

Life Apparently a native of Chester, he was brought up by William Cook, a nonconformist minister ejected from St. Michael's Church, Chester, in 1662, who died in 1684. Bold was instituted vicar of Shapwick in Dorset in 1674, but resigned or was ejected in 1688; he was instituted rector of Steeple in the Isle of Purbeck in 1682, and held the living until his death. In 1721 he succeeded to the adjacent parish of Tyneham, united to Steeple by act of parliament.Dictionary of National Biography; :s:Bold, Samuel (DNB00). In 1682, when a brief for the persecuted Huguenots was to be read in church, Bold preached a sermon against persecution and published it with Awnsham Churchill. With a second edition in the same year, it raised a great outcry; Bold then published a Plea for Moderation towards Dissenters. He justified his general praise of nonconformists, mentioning amongst others Richard Baxter and Henry Hickman as \\"shining lights in the church of God\\". In 1720 Bold republished the sermon against persecution, adding a short account of his subsequent troubles. The grand jury at the next assize presented Bold for the sermon and also for the Plea, and he was cited before the court of William Gulston, Bishop of Bristol, where he was accused of having \\"writ and preached a scandalous libel\\". Bold wrote answers to these charges, but he was commanded, on pain of suspension, to preach three recantation sermons. Meanwhile, in the civil courts, a further offence was there alleged against him that he had written a letter befriending a dissenting apothecary in Blandford. For the letter and the two publications he was sentenced to pay three fines, and Bold was seven weeks in prison before they were paid. After this the death of the bishop and of the promoter in the civil suit freed him from further annoyance. Works In 1688 he published A Brief Account of the Rise of the name Protestant, and what Protestantism is. By a professed Enemy to Persecution. In 1690 he engaged in a controversy with Thomas Comber, author of a Scholastical History of the Primitive and General Use of Liturgies in the Christian Church, which Bold perceived to be written to afford a pretext for persecuting dissent; in 1691 he followed it up with a second tract. In 1697 he began his tracts in support of Locke's Reasonableness of Christianity and An Essay Concerning Human Understanding. The Reasonableness of Christianity had appeared in 1695, and was attacked by Rev. John Edwards as a Socinian. Locke replied with a Vindication of his essay, to which Edwards answered in Socinianism Unmasked. At this point Bold entered the field, publishing in 1697 a Discourse on the true Knowledge of Christ Jesus, in which he insists, with Locke, that Christ and the apostles considered it enough for a Christian to believe that Jesus was the Christ. To the sermon he appended comments on Locke's essay and Vindication, declaring the essay 'one of the best books that had been published for at least 1,600 years,' and criticising Edwards's tracts. Edwards immediately retorted, and produced a second tract from Bold with a preface on the meaning of the terms \\"reason\\" and \\"antiquity\\" as employed in the Socinian controversy. This was in 1697; in 1698 a third tract of Bold's appeared, answering some Animadversions, published at Oxford. In 1699 he brought out a Consideration of the Objections to the Essay on the Human Understanding. Locke acknowledged Bold's support in his 'Second Vindication' of his essay; and in 1703 Bold visited Locke at Oates, Essex. He was then meditating the publication of further tracts which Locke dissuaded him from proceeding with. They were, however, published in 1706, and consist of a Discourse concerning the Resurrection of the Same Body and two letters on the necessary immateriality of created thinking substance. The letters discuss and condemn the views expressed in John Broughton's Psychologia and John Norris's Essay towards the Theory of an Ideal World. The discourse deals with Daniel Whitby's arguments against Locke. In 1717 Bold's publisher brought out another tract demanding toleration;The Duty of Christians with regard to Human Interpretations and Decisions, when proposed to be believed and submitted to by them, as necessary parts of the Christian Religion. By a Clergyman in the country; and in 1724 appeared his last controversial work, Some Thoughts concerning Church Authority. This was occasioned by Benjamin Hoadley's launching of the Bangorian Controversy, with a sermon on the nature of the kingdom of Christ, and his Preservative against the Principles and Practices of Nonjurors, of which Bold approved. Bold was answered by several persons, among others by Conyers Place, who condemned him as full of \\"stupid and affected cant\\". In 1693 he published a devotional treatise entitled Christ's Importunity with Sinners to accept of Him, which had been probably already published in 1675. The republication contains an affectionate dedication to Mrs. Mary Cook, the widow of William Cook, his early tutor. In 1696, an epidemic having caused many deaths in his parish, he published eight Meditations on Death written during the leisure bodily distempers have afforded me. In the year before his death Bold published a Help to Devotion containing a short prayer on every chapter in the New Testament.

Since the 19th century, the two nations have always had a complicated relationship. While Turkey and Saudi Arabia are major economic partners,Saudi Arabia/Turkey: Turkish Trade Minister commends Saudi-Turkish relations International Islamic News Agency, 8 February 2010 the two have a tense political relationship, deemed from the historic enmity. Differences in the practice of Islam between the two countries often cause frictions. Saudi Arabia has an embassy in Ankara and a consulate–general in Istanbul, and Turkey has an embassy in Riyadh and a consulate–general in Jeddah. Both countries are members of the World Trade Organization, G20 and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. According to a 2013 Pew global opinion poll, 26% of Turks express a favourable view of Saudi Arabia while 53% express an unfavourable view.Saudi Arabia’s Image Falters among Middle East Neighbors Pew Research Global Attitudes Project Historical background Historically, the relationship between Turkey and Saudi Arabia have always fluctuated between cooperation and distrust to uncertainty and rapprochement. This is because of the historical enmity between the two nations dated from the Ottoman era. In the 19th, the Ottomans entered into a serious conflict with House of Saud, the first Saudi state which resulted to the Ottoman–Saudi War. The war is seen in Saudi Arabia as the first attempt to create an independent state from the Ottoman Empire, while in Turkey, it is often considered to be the war against the Sunni movement. This led to a brutal military reprisal by the Ottoman rulers, which saw the destruction of the First Saudi State and the executions of many religious leaders of the Saudis. For this reason, there is an eternal enmity between the Turks and the Saudis, which is reflected by recent revisionist campaigns in both countries.https://english.alaraby.co.uk/english/comment/2020/6/24/saudi- arabias-erasure-of-its-ottoman-history-will- backfirehttps://www.arabobserver.com/turkish-propaganda-ignores-ottoman- violations-of-two-holy-mosques/https://english.alarabiya.net/en/in- translation/2020/07/30/As-Arabs-our-humanity-obliges-us-to-reject-the-Turks- early-servitude-of-the-Arabshttps://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20190829-saudi- arabia-changes-ottoman-empire-to-occupation-in-school-textbooks/ The Ottoman Empire's collapse following the World War I would eventually lead to the Saudi resurgence and future establishment of modern Saudi Arabia. The Hashimite rulers of the Hejaz pledged allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan in 1517 following the Ottoman conquest of Egypt, placing the holy cities of Mecca and Medina under Ottoman Protection until the Arab revolt in 1916 when Sharif Hussayn of Mecca expelled them with the aid of Britain. However, the Hashemites would be soon expelled by the Al-Saud, which would go on to rule Jordan and Iraq in the early 20th century, thus it changed to the focus of Turkey's relationship to Jordan and Iraq. Modern history Relations between Turkey and Saudi Arabia began in 1932, after the creation of the new Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. =Since 2010s= In October 2014, Saudi Arabia successfully campaigned against a Turkish bid for non-permanent membership of the United Nations Security Council, due to Saudi opposition to the Turkish stance on the Muslim Brotherhood. Due to the 2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis, the relationship between Turkey and Saudi Arabia faces problems, with Turkey supporting Qatar against Saudi Arabia in the ongoing diplomatic dispute. Geoeconomics expert M. Nicolas J. Firzli has argued that the Turkish government has sought to use the crisis to its own advantage, by advancing an expansionist Neo-Ottoman agenda at the expense of the Gulf Cooperation Council: Saudi Arabia, in response, has threatened to impose sanctions against Turkey, and has conducted discussions with the UAE on the topic of curbing “Turkish expansionist policy”. In turn, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused Saudi Arabia of being non- Islamic and heretics. Furthermore, Turkey has deployed troops to defend the government of Qatar from an attempted coup by Saudi Arabia and the UAE. On 1 March 2018, Saudi Arabia's MBC channels stopped broadcasting Turkish soap operas dubbed in Arabic to achieve the highest Arab interest. In March 2018, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman referred to Turkey as part of a \\"triangle of evil\\" alongside Iran and Muslim Brotherhood. In August 2018, Turkey backed Saudi Arabia in its dispute with Canada, rejecting the Canadian actions as a \\"form of interference in other countries’ internal affairs\\". On 2 October 2018, Saudi journalist and The Washington Post writer Jamal Khashoggi was killed in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul. It has been widely alleged that he was killed by the Saudi government, including by Erdogan, although he has refrained from criticizing Saudi Arabia directly and has instead suggested the blame lies with Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman. After the incident, Prince Mohammad rejected the concept of a rift with Turkey, stating, \\"Many are trying to … drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia and Turkey. … They will not be able to do it as long as there is a King Salman, a Mohammad bin Salman and a President Erdogan.\\" Almost a month after Khashoggi’s death, Erdogan directly accused the Saudi government of murdering the journalist. Erdogan said, \\"We know that the order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government.\\" He also said that \\"the puppet masters behind Khashoggi's killing\\" would be exposed. Yasin Aktay, a top Turkish official and adviser to Erdogan believes Khashoggi’s body was dissolved in acid after being dismembered. He said, \\"The reason they dismembered Khashoggi's body was to dissolve his remains more easily. Now we see that they did not only dismember his body but also vaporised it.” The movie Kingdoms of Fire, aired by MBC in 2019, was partially financed by Saudi Arabia, further exacerbated by the portrayal of the Ottoman Turks as violent, ruthless and uncivilized people. This had drawn criticism in Turkey. The 2020 Baghdad International Airport airstrike, where Iranian general Qasem Soleimani was assassinated by the United States, had revealed the complicated nature of the relationship between Saudi Arabia and Turkey, with both countries approved, in secret, the airstrike with hope to remove a grave threat from Iran to both countries' ambitions in the Middle East.https://www.trtworld.com/opinion/saudi-arabia- and-the-soleimani-assassination-33076 In February 2020, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir accused Turkey of financing and sponsoring the \\"extremist militias\\" in Somalia, Libya and Syria, Saudi Arabia also moved to block all Turkish websites in Saudi Arabia. In response, Ankara announced it would block all Saudi and Emirati websites in the country.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/04/turkey-blocks-saudi-emirati- state-news-websites-200419112800587.html In September 2020, during the 2020 Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, Saudi Arabian TV channel Al Arabiya had broadcast the speech of Armenian President Armen Sargsyan accusing Turkey and Azerbaijan of inflaming the conflict. In response, Turkish leader Erdoğan accused Arab countries of destabilising peace in Middle East and Caucasus, causing anti- Turkish sentiment to spread in Saudi Arabia as Saudi officials called for boycott against Turkish goods. This was rebutted by the Saudi who said they were committed to international treaties relating to trade. But the boycott seemed to have caused serious inflictions into the trade, as Maersk advised his clients to be aware of the Saudi ban on Turkish goods, and also Turkish business associations in Turkey appealed to the Turkish Government to find a solution for the conflict. It appeared that not only Turkish goods are targeted but also products \\"Made in Turkey\\" from foreign companies. =Armenian Genocide= Saudi Arabia had traditionally supported Turkey over the Armenian Genocide. However, due to the increasing deterioration of Saudi–Turkish relations, Saudi Arabia has started to raise the Armenian issue. In 2019, Saudi Arabia agreed to sponsor recognition of the genocide in the United States Congress, whereby Saudi Princess Reema bint Bandar Al Saud, Saudi Arabia's first female ambassador to the United States, condemned Turkey. The genocide has been formally recognized by the United States in statements, resolutions, and legal submissions several times, including in 1951, 1975, 1984, and 1996, before being officially recognized in a resolution in both houses in 2019 United States resolution on Armenian Genocide. Turkey and the Iranian–Saudi conflict Turkey has played a very edgy role in the Iran–Saudi Arabia proxy conflict. Though being similarly Sunni like the Saudis, however experiences over the Salafist movement and the past pride of being a Sunni empire made Turkey extremely distrustful of Saudi Arabia, and has rejected Saudi attempts to fight in Yemen.https://english.alarabiya.net/en/views/news/middle-east/2015/03/29/How- to-read-Turkey-s-stance-on-the-Yemen-crisis Turkey and Saudi Arabia, likewise, always fluctuates between antagonism and alliance. In the Syrian Civil War, Turkey and Saudi Arabia are on the Syrian opposition side against Iran-backed Bashar al-Assad, but Turkey sought to back the moderate forces, while Saudi Arabia encroached to Syria by supporting the radicals among the opposition, which made Turkey to become hostile.https://carnegieendowment.org/2012/04/13/turkey-s-relations-with- syrian-opposition-pub-47841https://mepc.org/journal/saudi-arabias-motives- syrian-civil-war Russian intervention forces Turkey and Saudi Arabia to have a level of compromise, but the distrustful of each others have hampered the process. Outside Syria and Yemen, Turkey and Saudi Arabia have also been clashing over Libya for influence. Turkey has been throwing significant support to the Islamist-backed Government of National Accord in Tripoli, while Saudi Arabia, along with Egypt and the UAE, supported Khalifa Haftar's House of Representatives in Tobruk.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/saudis- gave-libya-haftar-millions-dollars- offensive-190412175708363.htmlhttps://www.aa.com.tr/en/energy/energy- diplomacy/turkey-reaffirms-support-for-libya-s-tripoli-government/25992 Turkish action has gained support from Iran however, thus deepens mistrust between Turkey and Saudi Arabia.https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20200617-iran-fm-voices-support-for- turkey-backed-libya-government/ Turkey and Saudi Arabia also clash for influence regarding other Muslim countries, notably Sudan. Sudan was once a former ally of Iran, but has cut off relations with Iran since 2015 to support Saudi Arabia's war efforts in Yemen. However, Sudanese fear of Saudi Arabian influence facilitated then-dictator Omar al-Bashir to get closer to Turkey, resulting in the lease of Suakin to Turkish contractors.https://www.dailysabah.com/diplomacy/2019/04/26/turkey-to-remain- on-sudans-suakin-island-for-civilian- purposeshttps://www.trtworld.com/turkey/why-is-sudan-s-suakin-island- important-for-turkey--13630 According from Turkish media, Saudi Arabia has been deeply skeptical over Turkish presence in Sudan, out of fear that Turkey is attempting to take Sudan away from Saudi influence and threaten Saudi Arabia's security.https://www.dailysabah.com/columns/merve-sebnem- oruc/2019/05/10/who-is-disturbed-by-turkeys-presence-on-sudans-suakin-island Turkish–Saudi relationship is also hampered by clash between Islamic school thought. Turkey has been traditionally refraining from funding Islamic schools, but since 2010s, Turkey has begun funding more and more Islamic schools with moderate Sunni thought against hardline Wahhabi teachings, resulting in the perceiving Turkish attempt to eradicate Saudi-funded madrasah arises in Saudi Arabia.https://www.files.ethz.ch/isn/176753/WORKING-PAPER- _Venetis-Ev.pdf Though Turkish attempt is also looking to limit Iranian influence, Turkey also dislikes Saudi influence in similar manner. Overall, Turkey in the proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia is often decided by who would Turkey prefer above. Embassies The Embassy of Saudi Arabia is located in Ankara, Turkey.

History The college opened in 1988 and purports to be the largest A-level provider in the city. Over £3 million was spent on facilities before the college opened. Its campus comprises four buildings which include a library and learning resource centre, canteen, sports facilities and classrooms. The college offers a variety of Level 2 and Level 3 courses, including A-Levels and BTEC qualifications. A November 2013 Ofsted inspection report rated the college as 'good' in terms of its overall effectiveness. Facilities A £2 million facility known as the 'Wilson building' was opened in 2005 and served as the catalyst of a £20 million project that would be completed in May 2010. Later on, a £7 million centre known as the Ash building was opened in October 2008. This was the second of three buildings that formed as part of the renovation works. The building would house science, art, humanities, information and communication technology, health and social care and modern foreign languages courses, and would include 36 teaching spaces and two learning resource areas. The building was designed to be as environmentally friendly as possible, with temperature controls throughout and ground-source pumps that would circulate water constantly around the building from forty 100-metre deep bore-holes, which would either provide or remove heat according to the season. The project was funded by the college with significant investment from the British Government through the Learning and Skills Council. The Government paid for 80 per cent of the building costs. The Ash building, 2008 In May 2010, following three years of planning and construction, the £20 million project was completed following the construction of the 'Oak building', as well as facilities including an outdoor area, sports hall and a purpose built theatre and auditorium.  Results  313 students who entered for A-Level examinations in 1996 achieved scores which placed the college among the top third of colleges within the further education sector. In August 2011, the college secured 100 per cent pass rates in 34 subjects, while almost half of the passes achieved were in the higher grades of A*, A or B. At AS level the pass rate was 89.4 per cent, a 5.3 per cent improvement on 2010. In August 2017, the college achieved a 99.6% A-Level pass rate, as well as a 100% pass rate across 29 subjects with the proportion of students achieving A* to B grades being 47%. A total of 97 students managed to achieve an A* grade, with fifty of those achieving at least three grades at A* or A. 62 students studying BTEC courses at the college also secured three triple distinctions.

History Mechanics and Metals National Bank of the City of New York banking room in 1921, covering an area of approximately 10,500 square feet. Mechanics National Bank was founded in 1810 in New York City. In 1910 it merged with National Copper Bank (est. 1907 in New York), and took the Mechanics and Metals National Bank name. In 1911, a new and unrelated bank with the name, National Copper Bank, was founded in Salt Lake City. In May 1914, the directors of the Mechanics and Metals National Bank and the Fourth National Bank of New York agreed to unite. Mechanics and Metals had offered $200 a share for the stock of Fourth National. In March 1914 immediately before the merger, the Mechanics and Metals had net deposits of $58,433,000 and Fourth National had net deposits of $33,408,000. The resultant bank had net deposits of approximately $90,000,000. After approval from the Controller of the Currency the day before, on June 21, 1920, Mechanics and Metals and the Produce Exchange Union were merged. With branches in Manhattan and a main office at 20 Nassau Street, the new consolidated institution was named Mechanics and Metals National Bank. Combined capital, surplus, and profits of the new bank were approximated at $25,000,000, with deposits exceeding $200,000,000. Stockholders elected directors from both former institutions, including John E. Berwind of the Berwind-White Coal Mining Company, William H. Childs of the Barrett Company, Walter C.

Each animal is granted their wish. Following a large storm, the animals return one by one, to recount their adventures, supplemented with dancing and exclamations from the chorus. The animals include a break dancing turtle, a horse who wants to be a 'rider', a dog who wants to howl like a wolf, and a goldfish who wants to swim in the Sea of Japan. Works in development As of 2009, The Three Astronauts is a collaborative project being developed by the Family Opera Initiative. Conceived by its director, Grethe Barrett Holby, as a space opera, The Three Astronauts is based on the children's picture book of the same name written by Umberto Eco and illustrated by Eugenio Carmi. The story involves a Russian, a Chinese, and an American astronaut who all arrive on Mars at the same time. In their fear and loneliness, they band together to hunt down and kill the Martian they encounter, but ultimately embrace him as a friend.Ruch (2004) The work is envisaged as an integration of orchestral passages, children's chorus, sung and spoken text, movement, and visual theater. It will be performed in English, Chinese, Russian and \\"Martian\\" with each of the astronauts performing in their own language without supertitles. Librettists and composers from each country will write the dialogue and music for the astronauts, with a new language created for the Martian. American poet Nikki Giovanni's We're Going to Mars forms the text for the children's chorus. Eugenio Carmi will be the lead designer. The project's development partners are Ardea Arts and Atlantic Center for the Arts, with major funding provided The Jaffe Family Foundation.

Background Wallentin and Werliin met in 2004 whilst studying at the Academy of Music and Drama in Gothenburg, Sweden. They married a year later and formed Wildbirds & Peacedrums in 2007. Their music primarily consists of drums, percussion and vocals, with Wallentin also playing the string instrument the cittre, pump- organs and steel-pan on some songs. The band released their first album Heartcore in 2008, originally through Swedish label Found You Recordings, and later licensed to The Leaf Label for the rest of the world. That year, they were awarded the Årets Jazz i Sverige (Swedish Jazz Act of the Year), which funded the recording of their second album, The Snake, released in 2009. The band received critical acclaim for their first album, and in the summer of 2008 they undertook their first US tour and performed at several European festivals. They also supported other artists including Deerhoof, Efterklang, Bonnie 'Prince' Billy, Lykke Li and St. Vincent. In 2010, Wildbirds & Peacedrums travelled to Iceland to record and subsequently released two vinyl EPs: Retina (May 24) and Iris (June 21). Retina featured cellist and arranger Hildur Guðnadóttir and the Schola Cantorum Reykjavík Chamber Choir. These two Eps were later compiled as an album entitled Rivers (released on August 23, 2010). In a reaction to their busy touring schedule, in 2014 the duo returned to their studio in Stockholm to write, record and produce their fourth album, Rhythm. This record saw Wildbirds & Peacedrums stripping their music back to its roots of voice and percussion. In 2015, their song \\"Peeling Off the Layers\\" from the Rivers album was used as the title music for the Sky Atlantic TV series Fortitude. In the same year, Apple selected the song \\"There Is No Light\\", from the 2009 album The Snake, to soundtrack the launch of their new streaming service, Apple Music. In autumn 2015, as part of their 20th anniversary celebrations, The Leaf Label released the Rivers album on a single LP for the first time.

He was involved in both marine and locomotive engineering and invented a thermo- electric engine patented as the \\"Paragon\\". Durtnall transferred from the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve to a temporary commission as a captain in the Royal Air Force in April 1918. Early life Born in Herne Bay, Kent 1873; and baptised there on 2 February 1873, his father was a mariner before marriage and later became a carman on the railway. His mother ran a lodging house and his grandfather had been a sailmaker at Chatham Dockyard. Career Durtnall was apprenticed to Willans at Rugby, where he was involved in a junior position in work relating to the Heilmann steam locomotives. He first served at the Herne Bay Electric Light Co. in 1886. He then served at the Maxim Weston Electric Company's works at Dalston under Mr W J L Hamilton, Engineer for both companies, until 1890.Application to become Associate-Member of the Institution of Electrical Engineers, 1901 He was elected an Associate of the Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1893.The Electrical Engineer Volume 15, 1893, page 307 The Herne Bay Electric Light Co. appears never to have been formally registered. It was promoted by a firm called Shippy Bros, backed by the Universal Electric Light Co. and Durtnall (along with other employees) was not paid his wages between March 1888 and January 1889, resulting in a court case at Canterbury County Court on 2 April 1889. Durtnall was employed by the Herne Bay Co. from May 1887 to 26 January 1889 and was paid a wage of 6s. per week to clean and stoke the engine, fit up bells and attend to the offices. Judgement was given in £9 for 30 weeks wages.Whitstable Times and Herne Bay Herald, 6 April 1889 In October 1890 he was appointed Chief Electrical Engineer to the Cannon Street Hotel Co. he installed a high frequency electrical system at Cannon Street Hotel in 1895. He resigned in 1899; by 1901 he had set up in business as an Electric Light and Power Engineer from premises at 85 Finsbury Pavement, E.C. Notable installations included: Messrs Hurst & Co. Dye Works; The Guildhall Literary & Art School, Winchester Corporation; Anderton's Hotel, Fleet Street, London; Messrs Raphael Tuck & Sons, Moorfields City, London; Messrs A V Smeeton & Co., Sun Court, Golden Lane, City (Arthur Valentine Smeeton, costume & blouse manufacturer, bankrupt 1908). Some of his subsequent work was on buses and ships. He made an experimental petrol electric bus for London use c1905. However, was most of his work was with ships. Back in England, he continued work on 'hybrid' drives, namely coupling a high speed internal combustion engine to generators or alternators that produced electricity for variable speed electric traction motors that drove ship's propellors or wheels on automobiles and locomotives. The \\"Paragon\\" thermo-electric engine was developed and patented by Durtnall in the early years of the 20th century.UK Patent Application No. 6758, 1909, accepted 12 May 1910. He proposed a number of applications, including road, rail, marine and air transport. In 1906, Durtnall designed and constructed the first vehicle to be propelled by polyphase alternating current, generated on the vehicle itself. It took the form of a motor-omnibus that could travel at three different speeds.Letter to The Times Engineering Supplement, published 17 December 1913 World War I In the Great War, he served in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, transferring to the RAF when formed.

He was in the Air Ministry, which gave its staff Army ranks. His post was in the electrical section of the Civil Engineer's department. Later life and death Durtnall was active in engineering affairs from 1919, writing some articles, attending conferences, and making comments on proceedings until c1925, after which he appears to have written little. He spent his later years in Luton, where he died in 1947.

Cognitive network is different from cognitive radio (CR) as it covers all the layers of the OSI model (not only layers 1 and 2 as with CR ).  History  The first definition of the cognitive network was provided by Theo Kantor in his doctoral research at KTH, The Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, including a presentation in June 1998 of the cognitive network as the network with memory. Theo was a student of Chip Maguire who also was advising Joe Mitola, the originator of cognitive radio. Mitola focused on cognition in the nodes, while Kantor focused on cognition in the network. Mitola's Licentiate thesis, published in August, 1999 includes the following quote \\"Over time, the [Radio Knowledge Representation Language] RKRL-empowered network can learn to distinguish a feature of the natural environment that does not match the models. It could declare the errors to a cognitive network.\\" This is the earliest publication of the concept cognitive network, since Kantor published a bit later. IBM's autonomic networks challenge of 2001 instigated the introduction of a cognition cycle into networks. Cognitive radio, Kantor's cognitive networks, and IBM's autonomic networks provided the foundation for the parallel evolution of cognitive wireless networks and other cognitive networks. In 2004, Petri Mahonen, currently at RWTH, Aachen, and a member of Mitola's doctoral committee organized the first international workshop on cognitive wireless networks at Dagstuhl, Germany. In addition, the EU's E2R and E3 programs developed cognitive network theory under the rubric of self* - self organizing networks, self-aware networks, and so forth. One of the attempts to define the concept of cognitive network was made in 2005 by Thomas et al. and is based on an older idea of the Knowledge Plane described by Clark et al. in 2003 . B.S. Manoj et al. proposed a Cognitive Complete Knowledge Network System in 2008. Since then, several research activities in the area have emerged. A survey and an edited bookQ. Mahmoud, \\"Cognitive Networks: Towards Self-Aware Networks\\", John Wiley and Sons, 2007, . reveal some of these efforts. The Knowledge Plane is \\"a pervasive system within the network that builds and maintains high level models of what the network is supposed to do, in order to provide services and advice to other elements of the network\\" . The concept of large scale cognitive network was further made in 2008 by Song, where such Knowledge Plan is clearly defined for large scale wireless networks as the knowledge about the availability of radio spectrum and wireless stations.  Definition  Thomas et al. define the CN as a network with a cognitive process that can perceive current network conditions, plan, decide, act on those conditions, learn from the consequences of its actions, all while following end-to-end goals. This loop, the cognition loop, senses the environment, plans actions according to input from sensors and network policies, decides which scenario fits best its end-to-end purpose using a reasoning engine, and finally acts on the chosen scenario as discussed in the previous section. The system learns from the past (situations, plans, decisions, actions) and uses this knowledge to improve the decisions in the future. This definition of CN does not explicitly mention the knowledge of the network; it only describes the cognitive loop and adds end-to-end goals that would distinguish it from CR or so called cognitive layers. This definition of CN seems to be incomplete since it lacks knowledge which is an important component of a cognitive system as discussed in, and. Balamuralidhar and Prasad gives an interesting view of the role of ontological knowledge representation: “The persistent nature of this ontology enables proactiveness and robustness to ‘ignorable events’ while the unitary nature enables end-to- end adaptations.” In, CN is seen as a communication network augmented by a knowledge plane that can span vertically over layers (making use of cross- layer design) and/or horizontally across technologies and nodes (covering a heterogeneous environment). The knowledge plane needs at least two elements: (1) a representation of relevant knowledge about the scope (device, homogeneous network, heterogeneous network, etc.); (2) a cognition loop which uses artificial intelligence techniques inside its states (learning techniques, decision making techniques, etc.). Furthermore, in and, a detailed cross-layer network architecture was proposed for CNs, where CN is interpreted as a network that can utilize both radio spectrum and wireless station resources opportunistically, based upon the knowledge of such resource availability. Since CR has been developed as a radio transceiver that can utilize spectrum channels opportunistically (dynamic spectrum access), the CN is therefore a network that can opportunistically organize CRs.  Network architecture  The cross-layer network architecture of CN in is also named as Embedded Wireless Interconnection (EWI) as opposed to Open System Interconnection (OSI) protocol stack. The CN architecture is based on a new definition of wireless linkage. The new abstract wireless links are redefined as arbitrary mutual co-operations among a set of neighboring (proximity) wireless nodes. In comparison, traditional wireless networking relies on point-to-point \\"virtual wired-links\\" with a predetermined pair of wireless nodes and allotted spectrum. This network architecture also has the following three primary principles: * Functional Linkage Abstraction: Based on the definition of abstract wireless linkage, wireless link modules are implemented in individual wireless nodes, which can set up different types of abstract wireless links. According to the functional abstractions, categories of wireless link modules can include: broadcast, unicast, multicast, and data aggregation, etc. Therefore, network functionality can be integrated in the design of wireless link modules. This also results in two hierarchical layers as the architectural basics, including the system layer and the wireless link layer, respectively. The bottom wireless link layer supplies a library of wireless link modules to the upper system layer; the system layer organizes the wireless link modules to achieve effective application programming. * Opportunistic Wireless Links: In realizing the cognitive wireless networking concept, both the occupied spectrum and the participating nodes of an abstract wireless link are opportunistically determined by their instantaneous availabilities. This principle decides the design of wireless link modules in the wireless link layer. The system performance can improve with larger network scale, since higher network density introduces extra diversity in the opportunistic formation of any abstract wireless links. * Global QoS Decoupling: Global application or network QoS (Quality of Service) is decoupled into local requirements of co-operations in neighboring wireless nodes, i.e., wireless link QoS. More specifically, by decoupling global application-level QoS, it allows the system layer to better organize the wireless link modules that are provided by the wireless link layer. For example, by decoupling global network-level QoS, such as throughput, end-to- end delay, and delay jitter, the wireless link module design can achieve the global QoS requirements. Based on the provided wireless link modules, the complexity at individual nodes can be independent of the network scale. Wireless link modules provide system designers with reusable open network abstractions, where the modules can be individually updated, or new modules may be added into the wireless link layer. High modularity and flexibility could be essential for middleware or application developments. EWI is also an organizing-style architecture, where the system layer organizes the wireless link modules (at the wireless link layer); and peer wireless link modules can exchange module management information by padding packet headers to the system-layer information units. Five types of wireless link modules were proposed, including broadcast, peer-to-peer unicast, multicast, to-sink unicast, and data aggregation, respectively. Other arbitrary types of modules may be added, establishing other types of abstract wireless links without limitation. For example, the broadcast module simply disseminates data packets to surrounding nodes. The peer-to-peer unicast module can deliver data packets from source to destination over multiple wireless hops. The multicast module sends data packets to multiple destinations, as compared to peer-to-peer unicast. The to-sink unicast module can be especially useful in wireless sensor networks, which utilizes higher capabilities of data collectors (or sinks), so as to achieve better data delivery. The data-aggregation module opportunistically collects and aggregates the context related data from a set of proximity wireless nodes. Two service access points (SAP) are defined on the interface between the system layer and the wireless link layer, which are WL_SAP (Wireless Link SAP) and WLME_SAP (Wireless Link Management Entity SAP), respectively. WL_SAP is used for the data plane, whereas WLME_SAP is used for the management plane. The SAPs are utilized by the system layer in controlling the QoS of wireless link modules.

History In 1917, La Ceiba held its first fair known as “Feria la Isidra” in honor of its patron saint. It was during the event that the city picked the “Reina de la Feria” (Queen of the Fair). In 1968, it was decided that there would be a parade in honor of the Queen of the fair. The parade was held on May 25 with only 5 floats which were sponsored by local businesses. By 1972, over 15 floats were in the parade. In 1976, the first “carnavalito” was held in Barrio Mejia, a local neighborhood. Many neighborhoods were offered the chance to have one of these small carnivals and parades, but Barrio Mejia was the only one that accepted. Seeing that this carnavalito was a success, other neighborhoods followed in years later. The current Carnival Nowadays the festivities start with the crowning of the queen, 2 weeks before the parade. Then a small procession with many of the local high schools takes place. The official St. Isidore feast day is on May 15 and it’s a local public holiday. The week before the parade, from Monday to Friday, many neighborhoods and plazas have their own little carnivals.

During the lifetime of his elder brother John, the fourth lord, and very soon after her husband's death in Ireland (20 July 1398), Edward married the widowed Countess of March. Her lordships and castles of Usk and Caerleon thus fell into his hands. This brought him into relations with the chronicler Adam of Usk, who speaks of him as juvenis elegantissimus and is loud in his praises. Charlton's relationship to the Mortimers involved him, however, in hostility to Henry of Bolingbroke, who, in July 1399, was about to proceed from Bristol to ravage his lands; but the chronicler Adam, who combined Lancastrian politics with attachment to the house of Mortimer, claims to have negotiated peace, and to have persuaded Henry to take Charlton among his followers.Adam of Usk, The Chronicle of Adam Usk, 1377-1421, translated by Edward Maunde Thompson for the Royal Society of Literature, (London: J. Murray, 1876), p. 25 Charlton then accompanied Henry to Chester in his march against Richard II, and was afterwards in high favour with him. About this time Charlton showed his personal severity and the extent of the franchises of a lord marcher by condemning to death the seneschal of Usk for an intrigue with his natural sister, probably prioress of that town.Adam of Usk, p. 60 On 19 October 1401Adam of Usk. p. 68 the death of the 4th Baron Cherleton without issue involved Edward's succession to the peerage and estates of Powys. It was a critical period in the history of the Welsh marches. Owain Glyndŵr had already risen in revolt, and had ravaged the neighbourhood of Welshpool, the centre of the Charltons' power, whence he had been driven by John Charlton just before his death. Edward Charlton was possessed of inadequate resources to contend with so dangerous a neighbour; yet no border lord took a more prominent part in the Welsh war than he. In 1402 Owen overthrew his castles of Usk and Caerleon,Adam. of Usk, p. 76 though next year Charlton seems to have again got possession of them. In 1403 he urgently besought the council to reinforce the scanty garrisons of the border fortresses. In 1404 he was reduced to such straits that the council very unwillingly allowed him to make a private truce with the Welsh. In 1406 his new charter to Welshpool shows in its minute and curious provisions the extreme care taken to preserve that town as a centre of English influence, and exclude the 'foreign Welsh' from its government, its courts, and even its soil. Some time before 1408 Charlton was made a knight of the Garter. In 1409 he procured a royal pardon for those of his vassals who had submitted to Owen, but in 1409 Owen and John, the claimant to the bishopric of St. Asaph, renewed their attack on his territories. Strict orders were sent from London that Charlton was not to leave the district, but keep all his fortresses well garrisoned against the invader. The growing preponderance of the English side may be marked in the injunction of the council not in any case to renew his old private truce with the Welsh. Finally Charlton succeeded in maintaining himself against the waning influence of Owen. In January 1414 Sir John Oldcastle, after his great failure, escaped to those Welsh marches, where he had first won fame as a warrior, and ultimately took refuge in the Powys estates of Charlton. There he lurked for some time until the promise of a great reward and the exhortations of the bishops to capture the common enemy of religion and society induced Charlton to take active steps for his apprehension. At last, in 1417, the heretic was tracked to a remote farm at Broniarth, and, after a severe struggle, was captured by the servants of the lord of Powys. He was first imprisoned in Powys Castle, and thence sent to London. For this service Charlton received the special thanks of parliament. The charters are still extant in which he rewarded the brothers Ieuan and Gruffudd Vychan, sons of Gruffudd ap Ieuan, for their share in Oldcastle's capture (1419). In 1420 Charlton conferred a new charter on the Cistercian abbey of Strata Marcella, of which his house was patron. He died on 14 March 1421. Marriage and Issue Edward Charleton married twice: *Firstly to Alianore Holland, daughter of Thomas Holland, 2nd Earl of Kent and sister and co-heiress of Edmund Holland, 4th Earl of Kent, and widow of Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March. He left no sons, but two daughters and co- heiresses. The estates were divided between the co-heiresses, and the peerage fell into abeyance from which it has probably never emerged, the later creation in favour of the Greys being more probably a new peerage than a revival of the old one: **Joan Charleton, eldest daughter, who married Sir John Grey of Heton (c. 1385–1421), Northumberland **Joyce Charleton, youngest daughter, who married Sir John Tiptoft, and had descendants both powerful marcher chieftains. *Secondly to Elizabeth Berkeley, daughter of Sir John Berkeley of Beverstone Castle, Gloucestershire, who survived her husband and married secondly John Sutton, 1st Baron Dudley. Their son Edmund Sutton married Joyce Tiptoft, daughter of Joyce de Cherleton and Sir John Tiptoft. Grey and Dudley descendants jointly held the Cherleton inheritance, including Powis Castle, until it was allowed to pass to their kinsmen the Herbert family in 1587.

The company uses a lion as its logo, representing strength. Anglo's cursinhos (Anglo Vestibulares) are perhaps the reason of its popularity and notability. In 2005, 30% of the students who managed to enter in the University of São Paulo (whose vestibular FUVEST is considered one of the most difficult and competitive of Brazil) studied at Anglo, the highest percentage among other cursinhos.  History  In 1894, Portuguese educator Antônio Guerreiro founded in São Paulo the Professor Guerreiro Gymnasium, renamed Anglo-Latin Gymnasium after the Second World War in honour of the Allies. After the Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932, Celestino Rodrigues, a student of the Polytechnical School of the University of São Paulo, and Leo Bonfim, a teacher of the same school, started a cursinho called Anglo-Latin Course. In the late 1930s, when Guerreiro died, his heirs sold the gymnasium to Leo, Celestino and other professors, who expanded the place and opened the Anglo-Latin School. In 1950, Leo and Celestino decided to close and sell the gymnasium to pursue engineering careers. Simão Faiguenboim, a teacher who served as a principal for Anglo Course since the end of World War II, then invited fellow teachers Emílio Gabriades and Abram Bloch to continue the activities in Colégio São Paulo de Piratininga. Carlos Marmo, a drawing teacher, joined the trio. Anglo then created its first fascicles, \\"simulados\\" (lit. \\"simulated\\", non-official tests simulating a vestibular) and the \\"O Anglo Resolve\\" (Anglo Solves), a publication with the resolutions and comments of the main vestibulares. In the 1960s, Mathematics teacher Cid Guelli entered Anglo. In the next decade, Anglo, which initially focuses in the area of exact sciences, expanded its activities to cover the areas of humanities and biological sciences. In the early 1980s, the first textbooks by Anglo were produced for high schools that established a partnership with the company, and a second unity in Sergipe Street was built. The third unity opened in João Dias Avenue in the 1990s, and material for kindergarten and elementary school began to be produced. In 2010, Sistema Anglo de Ensino was bought by Grupo Abril.  Units  Nowadays, there are other unities spread all over Brazil, mostly in the state of São Paulo. Many schools have also adopted their educational system, eventually changing its name.

Origins  As early as 1828 when the Cromford and High Peak Railway and the Liverpool and Manchester Railway were still under construction, a Mr Thomas Legh had proposed in Stockport, that they could well be connected by a railway line from the former's terminus at Whaley Bridge. There were also number of other ideas for lines from London to meet the C&HPR; at Cromford to reach Manchester. The main problem had been that of carrying passengers on the series of cable operated sections (see Derby station) In the next few years the route of the line was hotly contested by the three major railways of the time. The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway had gained approval in 1848 for an extension of the Whaley Bridge branch of the Peak Forest Canal, which it owned, from Bugsworth to the tramway, with the eventual aim of reaching Buxton. This was succeeded by plans for a railway line, but neither scheme had been proceeded with due to lack of funds.Dow, G., (1962) Great Central, Volume Two: Dominion of Watkin (1864-1899) , Shepperton: Ian Allan Ltd. The Midland Railway and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway had jointly leased the impecunious Manchester, Buxton, Matlock and Midlands Junction Railway which had reached Rowsley by 1849, with the view of running through Buxton and up the Goyt Valley to Whaley Bridge and thence to a junction with the M&B; at Cheadle Hulme. However, when the M&B; merged into the new LNWR the latter naturally sought to restrict competition with its own London to Manchester service. Construction In 1853 Thomas Legh, together with other landowners and financiers from London, formed the committee of the Stockport Disley and Whaley Bridge railway, with its first meeting at the Swann Inn Disley. The engineers would be Joseph Locke and J. E. Errington. When the Bill was put before Parliament there was opposition from both the MS&LR; and the LNWR, however the Stockport and Whaley Bridge Railway Act was passed on 31 July 1854. The line would be operated on the company's behalf by the LNWR. A further Act in 1855 allowed for a short line from Whaley Bridge to the end of the Cromford and High Peak. Construction of the line produced very few problems, the main one being an embankment between Hazel Grove and Norbury. The line was opened on 28 May 1857 and a special train left Stockport for Whaley Bridge where on the return a celebratory dinner was held in the schoolroom at Disley. That evening a supper was provided for the workmen. The actual first service was on 9 June, the intermediate stations being Hazel Grove, Disley, New Town (south of New Mills) and Furness Vale. Coaching connections were provided to Buxton and Chapel-en-le-Frith. A viaduct to connect the line with the Cromford and High Peak was not complete when traffic began in August 1857. The carrier had to transfer the limestone using his own horses and carts. The wagons carrying the limestone were added to the passenger trains, and it was reported that three wagonloads were despatched with each. The viaduct was completed towards the end of the year. In 1855 there a meeting of the three companies at Euston Square, where it was noted that the S&WB; line was virtually complete. The possibility of extending it to Buxton or Rowsley was discussed. Both the MS&LR; and the Midland proposed that no one of the three companies should proceed alone with any scheme, but the meeting ended with them more than a little suspicious of the LNWR. The SD&WBR;'s capital was £150,000, of which £85,000 came from the LNWR and £3,750 from the C&HPR.; Although, the public message was that the line was independently financed, James Allport of the Midland Railway felt justified in saying it was an LNWR undertaking - moreover deliberately designed to prevent other railways from entering the area. The Buxton extension At the end of 1856, the Midland approached the LNWR with a proposal to extend the jointly leased MBM&MJR; as a through route. They offered to subscribe £200,000 and the Duke of Devonshire was willing to add £50,000, even allowing the line to pass through Chatsworth Park if necessary. The LNWR turned down the offer and, in fact, were quietly pursuing plans for an extension of the SD&WB.; When the Bill went before Parliament the Midland made no opposition. They had been refused a hearing about the original railway on the ground that they had no locus standi. The 'Stockport Disley and Whaley Bridge Railway Extension Act was passed on 27 July 1857. Fox Fox, G.K. (2006) The Buxton Line - Part One, Stockport: Foxline Limited suggests this was facilitated by the Duke of Devonshire and discussions with the MSL and Midland Railways. While these may have been amicable at first they were not the destined to stay that way. Additional capital of £200,000 was to be raised for the extension and, once again, the LNWR contributed the lion's share - £105,000 with the MS&LR; providing up to £35,000. Formal transfer to the LNWR took place on 16 November 1866.Railway Magazine June 1963 p.382 Moreover, while the Midland's original plan had been to cross from Buxton to the Goyt Valley then north to Whaley Bridge,\\"District map of the Ambergate, Nottingham & Boston, and Eastern Junction Railway, with extension and branches.\\" Late 19th century. Lincolnshire Archives ref: 4 GL/5/6. Acc. Number: 2008/35. the LNWR took a roundabout route through Chapel-en-le-Frith thence by an immense curve to Dove Holes before travelling south to Buxton. It certainly didn't suit the expresses that the Midland intended to run, The Midland felt that, simply for political reasons, the LNWR had built an inferior line. As Allport put it \\"The proposed railway, for some reason which does not appear on the face of it\\" is run along the high country where there is little or no population; and instead of taking the valley with a gradually rising ascent, \\"it goes up the steep gradient out of Buxton, to fall down again. The line appears to me to have gone up the hill for the sake of going down again.\\" Williams, F.S., (1874) The Midland Railway: Its Rise and Progress Derby: Bemrose and Son Work began in 1859 and progressed fairly smoothly. There were problems at Combs where there was to be a road underbridge. In the end, it proved necessary to divert the road to a point where the embankment was shallower. There was one tunnel planned - Eaves Tunnel. It had been expected to be 300 yards, but finished as 431 yards long. On the same stretch over the Barmoor, north of Dove Holes, a planned 87 feet deep cutting, became Barmoor Clough Tunnel of 111 yards. The company was now openly under the control of the LNWR with its secretary, C. E. Stewart, also the secretary of the SD&WBR.; The line was open to Buxton on 30 May 1863. On the same day as the Midland line from Rowsley, although full passenger services did not begin until 15 June.

Awards is an annual music awards show in the United Kingdom, founded by the music magazine, Kerrang! and focusing primarily on rock music. The annual awards features performances by prominent artists, and some of the awards of more popular interest are presented in a televised ceremony. Unlike many major music awards shows, the nominees and winners of the Kerrang! Awards are determined by fan votes. History Since they began in 1993, the Kerrang! Awards became one of Britain's most recognised award events by the now-defunct Guinness Book of British Hit Singles & Albums, often listing some of the winners in their annual round-up of the previous year. The event is presented by major music celebrities, with many others outside the industry who attend the event, sometimes presenting the awards with one example being Jodie Marsh in 2003 presenting Feeder with their Best British Band award. Perhaps one of the notable events of recent years was the ceremony of 2000, in which Slipknot set fire to their table after winning Best Band in the World. Lostprophets nearly became the first act to win three times in succession the Best British Band award, but lost to Bullet for My Valentine in 2008, who later achieved the succession in 2010. It has since been suggested, that since Ian Watkins conviction, Lostprophets awards should be rescinded. Thirty Seconds to Mars holds the record for most Best Single wins at three. The band is also the first artist to win Best Single in two consecutive years at the Kerrang! Awards 2007 and Kerrang! Awards 2008. Many international companies, including Island Records, Orange Music Electronic Company and Marshall Amplification, are involved in the sponsorship of the various award categories. It has been noted that the awards sometimes do not adhere to a strict \\"biggest is best\\" code, as some of the winners and nominees for the newer awards, such as Best International Newcomer, have been awarded to bands with either minor exposure or a strong live reputation, such as 2010 Best International Newcomer winners Trash Talk. There have also been controversial winners of these awards. An example of this being the winners of Best British Newcomer and Best International Newcomer, from the 2006 event (Bring Me the Horizon and Aiden). However, most of the categories ever since the first ceremony in 1993 have honored artists who have experienced notable commercial chart success at the time of winning their award, with Best British Band, Best International Band and Hall of Fame being examples. Winning an award has been seen as an important achievement and event of an artist career, with Feeder's frontman Grant Nicholas saying that their 2003 accolade, was the award their late drummer Jon Lee had always wanted the band to win, with Nicholas dedicating the award to him. That same year, Justin Hawkins of The Darkness expressed his disappointment at not winning Best British Newcomer, as it would have meant the band winning every award they were nominated for, only to have this denied by Funeral For a Friend. The 23rd Kerrang! Awards were held on 13 June 2014, at the Troxy in Stepney, in the East End borough of Tower Hamlets. The awards ceremony did not take place in 2017, but returned in June 2018 with the likes of Neck Deep, Enter Shikari, Code Orange and Foo Fighters collecting awards, while the event also featured several special guests including Johnny Depp and Justin Hawkins. The event was not broadcast on TV but several acceptance speeches and interviews were uploaded to Kerrang's YouTube channel, and the ceremony naturally received heavy coverage in the following week's edition of the magazine. The Kerrang! Awards 2019 took place on June 19, 2019. Categories As of the 2018 ceremony, the following awards are presented at the Kerrang! Awards. *Best Song (formerly 'Best Single') *Best Album *Best British Band *Best International Band *Best British Breakthrough *Best International Breakthrough *Best British Live Act *Best International Live Act *Kerrang!

Icon Television broadcasts The first time the awards were televised, was in 2001 via a recording on Channel 5 in the UK, with Channel 4 also showing a recording at late-nights until 2004. The 2007 awards were televised on the now-defunct Hits music channel, and the 2008 awards were televised on the new 4Music music channel, owned by Channel 4.

The MIPS concept can be used to measure eco-efficiency of a product or service and applied in all scales from a single product to complex systems. The calculation takes into account materials required to produce a product or service. The total material input (MI) is divided by the number of service units (S). For example, in case of a passenger car, the number of service units is the total number of passenger kilometres during the whole life span of the vehicle. The lower the material input per kilometre, the more eco-efficient is the vehicle. The whole life-cycle of a product or service is measured when MIPS values are calculated. Accessed 22 February 2012 This allows comparisons of resource consumption of different solutions to produce the same service. When a single product is examined, the MIPS calculations reveal the magnitude of resource use along the life-cycle and help to focus efforts on the most significant phases to reduce environmental burden of the product. Increasing resource efficiency There are two ways to reduce the material consumption per unit of service, the material input (MI) of the product can be reduced or amount of service units (S) can be increased. Material input in the production phase can be reduced by using less energy or raw materials. Also transport chains can be rationalized. In the use phase the material input per unit of service can be reduced when amount of service produced is increased. For instance in case of a newspaper the material input can be reduced by using recycled paper instead of primary. Material input per reader decreases when the same paper is shared with several persons. High quality products and availability of spares potentially increase the service life of the product. When the service life of a product is increased, the material consumption per unit of time decreases. Usually services like car sharing also help to reduce MIPS values since fewer products are needed to produce the service for greater number of people. Factor X concept The Factor X concept was coined by Prof. Friedrich Schmidt-Bleek.Robèrt, K.-H., Schmidt-Bleek, B., Aloisi de Larderel, J., Basile G., Jansen, J.L., Kuehr, R., Price Thomas, P., Suzuki, M., Hawken, P. and M. Wackernagel. (2002). Strategic sustainable development – selection, design and synergies of applied tools. Journal of Cleaner Production. 10: 197–214. The factor targets refer to dematerializing of our economies. The Factor Ten Club founded in 1994 and the Factor 10 Institute founded in 1997 support the dematerialization target. It has been proposed that material flows in the industrialized countries should be decreased by factor 10 to reach more sustainable level of material use. Aim of factor targets is to increase resource productivity and increase the wealth created from the resources. The factor concept can be applied on microeconomic and macroeconomic levels. For instance the Wuppertal Institute presents micro-level best practices related to Factor Four guideline. Natural resource categories The MIPS method can be used to measure natural resource consumption in five categories, viz. abiotic and biotic resources, earth movements in agriculture and silviculture, water and air. Abiotic resources refer to non-renewable resources like minerals, fossil energy sources and soil excavations. Biotic resources refer to renewable resources like plant biomass. Earth movements include mechanical movements and erosion. Water includes surface, ground and deep ground water used by humans. Air is calculated when it is used in combustion processes or chemically or physically transformed. The concept of total material requirement (TMR) used in many cases used in macro-level statistics and it refers to sum of abiotic and biotic resources and erosion. Material intensity factors The cornerstone of MIPS calculations are the material intensity factors. The Wuppertal Institute has the most extensive list of MI- factors.The Wuppertal Institute, List of MI-factors (2003) Factors are provided for a wide range of basic materials and energy. The factors indicate how many kilograms of natural resources in each of the five natural resource categories are used or transferred in the ecosystem to produce one kilogram of certain material or a unit of energy. Concept of ecological backpack Ecological backpack is calculated by subtracting the net weight of the products from the total material input of it. The ecological backpack illustrates the hidden flows which cannot be seen in the final product.Robèrt, K.-H., Schmidt-Bleek, B., Aloisi de Larderel, J., Basile G., Jansen, J.L., Kuehr, R., Price Thomas, P., Suzuki, M., Hawken, P. and M. Wackernagel. (2002). Strategic sustainable development – selection, design and synergies of applied tools. Journal of Cleaner Production. 10: 197–214. In many cases vast amount of resources are used or transferred in the developing world where the raw material production takes place. It is important to find tools to illustrate these mass movements since consumption of the products by large part takes place in the developed world. In many cases the weight of backpacks are multiple times heavier than the product itself. Scope and limitations of the MIPS method The MIPS method measures the life-cycle wide material inputs required to produce a product or service. The MIPS method doesn’t straightforwardly measure waste, pollution and other negative outputs produced by the human economy. However, all material inputs become outputs of the economy at some point, and when inputs are reduced also negative outputs like waste will decrease. MIPS provides a rough but easily understandable tool to measure overall volume and efficiency of resource use. Røpke 2001: 130 states: “As the number of pollution problems is very large, it is difficult to construct reasonable indicators for overall environmental impact from the output side.Røpke, I. (2001). The environmental impact of changing consumption patterns: a survey. International Journal of Environment and Pollution. 15:2 127–145. The focus on inputs is thus a way to avoid drowning in detail.” Since MIPS does not take into account for instance ecotoxicity of materials and processes it should be used together with other methods taking into account these issues. Criticism towards the MIPS concept The most common criticism towards MIPS method is related to the fact that MIPS does not take into account ecotoxicity of materials. Schmidt-Bleek reminds us that also non-toxic material flows can affect the environment. The current climate issue and CO2 emissions show that also vast amounts of non-toxic materials may contribute to environmental problems. Critiques have also noted that extensive material flows occur in natural processes. However, the pace on which humans transfer materials is so fast that the environment cannot keep up with it and reproduce itself. Conducted MIPS studies MIPS-concept has been applied in multiple research projects, especially in Germany and Finland. The most extensive projects in Finland concerned transport sector and household consumption. FIN- MIPS Transport projectLähteenoja, S., M. Lettenmeier and A. Saari.(2006).

The Finnish Environment 820en. studied the Finnish transport system both from passenger and goods transport perspective in 2003–2005 whereas the FIN-MIPS Household projectKotakorpi, E., S. Lähteenoja, and M. Lettenmeier.(2008). In press. examined material intensity of housing, mobility, foodstuffs, household goods, tourism, leisure and sport activities in Finland and on sample of 27 Finnish households.

He played part of one season in Major League Baseball (MLB), primarily as a starting pitcher, for the Kansas City Royals in 2002. Professional careerMinor league career, part 1= After attending Iowa State University, Sedlacek was drafted by the Kansas City Royals in the 14th round of the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft. He began his minor league career pitching for the Spokane Indians of the single-A (short season) Northwest League. In 16 games (13 starts), he had a 9-2 record (tying for the league lead in wins with Chris Mears), a 3.45 earned run average (ERA) (fifth), 62 strikeouts, and 18 walks in 86 innings pitched (third behind Mears's and Jeff Hundley's ). In 1999, Sedlacek pitched for the Wilmington Blue Rocks of the single-A advanced Carolina League. In 17 starts, he had a 4-6 record, a 5.28 ERA, 69 strikeouts, and 26 walks in 92 innings pitched. He was promoted to the Wichita Wranglers of the double-A Texas League in 2000. In 35 games, he had a 3.66 ERA, 81 strikeouts, and 43 walks in innings pitched (10th in the league). Despite only making 16 starts, he led the league with 15 wins. Sedlacek split 2001 between the Wranglers and the Omaha Royals of the triple-A Pacific Coast League. In 14 starts with Wichita, he had a 6-7 record, a 3.63 ERA, 66 strikeouts, and 14 walks in innings. In 14 games (13 starts) for Omaha, he had a 5-4 record, a 5.00 ERA, 44 strikeouts, and 22 walks in 81 innings. =Lone season in the majors= In June 2002, Sedlacek was called up by the Royals following injuries to Jeremy Affeldt and Paul Byrd. He made his major league debut on June 18, getting a no-decision in a 5-4 loss to the Montreal Expos. In his second start, he gave up one run in six innings but took a no-decision in a 5-4 loss to the New York Mets. Due to his performance, Royals' manager Tony Peña decided to keep him in the rotation. On July 4, Sedlacek had one of the best starts of his career; he allowed one run in seven innings, receiving a no-decision in a 3-2 loss to the Oakland Athletics. His first career win came on July 15, in the first game of a doubleheader, when he gave up three runs in six innings as the Royals defeated the Texas Rangers 8-6. He played in 16 games (14 starts) going 3-5 with a 6.72 ERA and 52 strikeouts in his only major league season. =Minor league career, part 2= Sedlacek left the Royals' organization after the 2003 season and played for the next two years in the minors for several other teams and also in the independent Northern League. Personal life Sedlacek's wife, Joy, currently works for the Royals as the Senior Director of Royals' charities. They live in Overland Park, Kansas. The Sedlaceks have one child and also own a dog named Abbey. Sedlacek has also helped with Royals' charities, visiting Joplin, Missouri, to help rebuild homes after a tornado in 2012. Shawn Sedlacek established Sed Sports, Inc. in 2006 with the goal of giving back to the game that had meant so much and played such a huge role in his life. Shawn began by offering pitching lessons to players from all over the Kansas City metro area who ranged in ability from beginners to current professional players. After focusing primarily on pitching lessons for six years, giving thousands of hours of private instruction, and building his client base to several hundred players, Shawn decided to expand Sed Sports to include teams. In 2013, Shawn, Todd Sears, and Matt Williams decided to partner and establish Complete Game Baseball to continue the growth of the organization in pursuit of Shawn’s dream back in 2006 to give back to the game.

by establishing community-based medical integration, equalization of opportunities, and Physical therapy (Physiotherapy) rehabilitation programs for the disabled. The strength of CBR programs is that they can be made available in rural areas, with limited infrastructure, as program leadership is not restricted to professionals in healthcare, educational, Physiotherapy , Occupational therapy vocational or social services. Rather, CBR programs involve the people with disabilities themselves, their families and communities, as well as appropriate professionals. Some are doing their own works. History In the beginning of the 1960s, efforts to establish rehabilitation centers in developing countries had taken hold in urban centers, but failed to provide support and assistance to disabled people in rural areas throughout the world. The response of world aid organizations was to shift funding from city-based hospitals to rural community programs. The first CBR pilot projects were launched in the 1960s, and their continuing success has led to CBR programs being adopted throughout Africa, Asia and [South America].  CBR Asia Pacific Network  A CBR Network is a formal or informal relationship among CBR implementers/ practitioners or their organizations to promote and strengthen CBR. The strength of the network depends on the strength of individual or organizational members and the co- ordination and collaboration between members. It is expected that the benefits from the network will be greater than any individual's effort. To enrich CBR further for the benefit of the people with disabilities, their family, community and the country, a network of CBR practitioners/implementers/promoters is required at least at a national level, regional level and global level. These networks need to be democratic, national CBR network members need to select their national executive body; e.g., CBR Afghanistan Network, CBR India Network, CBR Indonesia Network. President or the secretary of the national networks should represent the general body of the Regional Network; e.g., CBR Asia Pacific Network. General body of the CBR AP Network to elect their Executive body and representatives for CBR Global Network. While electing the executive body one must ensure that committee represents with competent and committed people. CBR is for all, richness and success of CBR depends on diversity and respecting that diversity. An ideal CBR committee should be of people from various background; e.g., people with disabilities (different impairment groups), academicians, people with different socio economic background, people coming from rural areas or representing vulnerable groups policy makers, practitioners, promoters, representative from public and private sectors. Gender and disability balance are the key of the success of any CBR Networks. Around the world there are existing networks: large and small, formal and informal, active and inactive, etc. For example the CBR Africa Network is a large network covering one continent. In 2001 during the first Africa Regional Conference on CBR in Kampala, Uganda, the CBR Africa Network (CAN) was created. It started with four action points: * Initiate the formation of National CBR Associations. * Improve capacity for sharing information about good CBR practices. * Review CBR training programmes in order to promote their synchronisation. * Organize regular (every three years) CBR Conferences in Africa, starting with one in 2004. There are other notable networks including the CBR South-Asia Network is a sub regional network and there exists across the world many National CBR Networks. At present three larger continental (regional) networks are under development or expansion including the CBR Africa Network (CAN), CBR America Network (RED de RBC de las Américas y el Caribe) and the CBR Asia-Pacific Network. One of the main outcomes of the CBR Asia-Pacific Congress was to form the CBR Asia-Pacific Network. The 1st CBR Asia Pacific Congress provided a great opportunity to form the general body of the CBR Asia-Pacific Network who eventually would meet and elect their executive body and take the CBR Asia-Pacific Network forward. The initial purpose of the CBR Asia-Pacific Network was to promote and strengthen CBR across the continent and in countries; mobilize resources, organize trainings and support information exchange. Twenty-four country representatives have nominated and selected among CBR promoters/implementers/practitioners, including persons with disabilities, taking gender equity, organizational and regional diversity into consideration. The country representatives of the Network held their first meeting immediately after the Congress. Members present in the meeting have taken the responsibility to form the CBR Asia- Pacific Network, draft a constitution, draw a future plan of actions and take it forward (as a continuation of dialogue) with support from the Asia-Pacific Center on Disability (APCD) as the secretariat of the Network.

The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students.Regular Session 2007-2008 House Bill 1067, Act 61 Section 6 page 8 The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education.Pennsylvania Academic Standards Wellness policy Conemaugh Township Area School Board established a district wellness policy in 2006 - Policy 246. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 - 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" The legislation placed the responsibility of developing a wellness policy at the local level so the individual needs of each district can be addressed. According to the requirements for the Local Wellness Policy, school districts must set goals for nutrition education and physical education that are aligned with the Pennsylvania State Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education, campus food provision, and other school-based activities designed to promote student wellness. Additionally, districts were required to involve a broad group of individuals in policy development and to have a plan for measuring policy implementation. Districts were offered a choice of levels of implementation for limiting or prohibiting low nutrition foods on the school campus. In final implementation these regulations prohibit some foods and beverages on the school campus.Nutrition Standards for Competitive Foods in Pennsylvania Schools for the School Nutrition Incentive, Pennsylvania Department of Education — Division of Food and Nutrition. July 2008 The policy requires that the Superintendent or designee shall report to the Board on the district's compliance with law and policies related to student wellness. The Pennsylvania Department of Education required the district to submit a copy of the policy for approval. Special education In December 2009, the district administration reported that 166 pupils or 15.9% of the district's pupils received Special Education services.Bureau of Special Education State Performance Plan Public Reporting for School Districts and Charter Schools Intermediate Unit 8 and each school district in Somerset counties have established and implemented procedures to locate, identify, and evaluate students and young children suspected of being exceptional. These procedures include screening activities which include but are not limited to: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, and report cards); hearing screening (at a minimum of kindergarten, special ungraded classes, first, second, third, seventh, and eleventh grades); vision screening (every grade level); motor screening; and speech and language screening. In schools which have a Pre-Referral, Child-Study, Early Intervening or Instructional Support Team, the above screening activities may lead to consideration by the teams to move the next level of screening activities. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the district's Department of Special Education.Annual Public Notice of Special Education Services and Programs for IU8 School Districts and Schools Governance The school district is governed by 9 individually elected board members (serve four-year terms), the Pennsylvania State Board of Education, the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Pennsylvania General Assembly.Pennsylvania Public School Code Governance 2010 The federal government controls programs it funds like Title I funding for low-income children in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the No Child Left Behind Act, which mandates the district focus resources on student success in acquiring reading and math skills. The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives Sunshine Review gave the school board and district administration a \\"F\\" for transparency based on a review of \\"What information can people find on their school district's website\\". It examined the school district's website for information regarding; taxes, the current budget, meetings, school board members names and terms, contracts, audits, public records information and more. The school board provides meeting of the whole minutes online from the July Board Meeting Minutes 2004 to the November Board Meeting Minutes 2010. Enrollment The district's enrollment is in the bottom 8% in Pennsylvania. According to the Pennsylvania Department of Education, there are fewer than 950 students enrolled in K-12. The administrative infrastructure and mandate related costs per pupil are very high. With limited local taxation resources, opportunities for students are limited.School District Consolidation Fact Sheet Consolidation with an adjacent school district would achieve substantial cost savings. These savings could be redirected to improving lagging student achievement, to enriching the academic programs or to reducing property taxes. In 1994, a consolidation study was conducted at the request of district officials. A study was done in 2004, examining consolidating school administrations of Conemaugh Township Area School District with neighboring: Shade-Central City School District saving hundreds of thousands of dollars for both communities, with North Star School District saving nearly one million dollars or with Richland School District saving over $1,000,000.Pennsylvania Legislative Budget and Finance Committee, Study of the Cost Effectiveness of Consolidating Pennsylvania School Districts, 2007 Part 2 page 68, page 71 and page 263. The study noted that consolidation could significantly decrease administrative costs for both communities while improving offerings to students. Rural Pennsylvania school enrollment is projected to decrease 8 percent by 2011. The most significant enrollment decline is projected to be in western Pennsylvania, where rural school districts may have a 16 percent decline. More than 40 percent of elementary schools and more than 60 percent of secondary schools in western Pennsylvania are projected to experience significant enrollment decreases (15 percent or greater). \\"Research Analyzes Rural School District Enrollment and Building Capacity\\", The Center for Rural Pennsylvania.

Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30.

Benchtop injectors have become more common as inexpensive CNC milling machines have reduced the cost of producing molds in a home workshop. In hobby injectors injection pressure is generated manually by the operator, with a lever or gear translating the operator's effort to the required pressure. The most common hobby injection machine uses a handle to press down with. This enables the user to generate roughly of downward force, through the use of leverage. History It is not known when the first hobby injection molder was constructed. Before the development of inexpensive CNC milling machines, producing a metal mold was prohibitively expensive for most hobbyists. With a small CNC mill and personal CAD tools, though, even complex shapes can be cut easily and accurately. Applications Hobby injection molding has a variety of applications including the creation of low costing prototypes, new inventions, replication of lost or broken parts, and provides homeowners the opportunity to build anything. Hobby injection molding is a low cost method of repeatable production. Materials Polyethylene (both LDPE and HDPE), polypropylene, and polystyrene (including HIPS) have all been used successfully with lever-actuated benchtop injectors. Equipment Benchtop injectors are smaller and simpler than their larger commercial counterparts because they rely on the operator to manually inject melted polymer into the mold and remove the finished part from the mold. Production injectors automatically inject melted polymer at a prescribed rate into the mold, cool the mold to rapidly solidify the polymer, then eject the part from the mold once it's cool. The two halves of the mold must be pressed together with great force to prevent a defect in the part where the two halves meet, and the nozzle of the injector must be pressed tightly against the inlet port of the mold to prevent the escape of melted polymer and again a defect in the finished part. In a benchtop injector this is done manually by clamping or bolting the mold together and clamping the complete mold into the injector. In a production injector this is accomplished with hydraulic or pneumatic actuators, which increase the cost of the machine but dramatically reduce the labor required to produce a finished part. =Mold= Injection mold epoxy casting Epoxy Casting. Epoxy Casting is the use of a liquid epoxy that has been mixed with a metal alloy. Typically the most common form of epoxy based molds are combined with atomized aluminum. The atomized aluminum allows for the distribution of heat from the mold surface outward toward the edges. This preserves the surface quality of the mold for typically 50 - 100 cycles on a single epoxy mold. Metal molds Low cost bench top cnc milling machines allows home enthusiast to machine molds into soft material. Rather than P20 tool steel, most grades of aluminum can be machined into working mold capable of 1000 plus cycles. Mic 6 cast aluminum is more stable post machining and during cycles than hot extruded grades like 6061 and is easy to machine however it has lower mechanical properties. 7000 series like 7050 and 7075 are the most preferable for the best mechanical properties in aluminum next to specializes mold grade aluminum like Fortal, they are all comparable to low to mid carbon steel mold. Copper alloys like pewter or bizmith alloys molds can be cast around a model to create strong mold with higher molding temperatures than epoxy molds. The casting around a model to create each mold part produces complex mold part quickly. The parts can also capture detailed fit face finishes. Pressurized mold casting Due to the nature of oxygen entrapment in epoxy during the pouring and curing period it is common to have distortions and cavitation in the final injection mold. Pressurizing epoxy during the curing period is a form of surface quality retention. External pressures can be created with the use of a pressure pot connected to an air compressor. The external pressure causes air to be trapped inside the epoxy mold and crushed during curing. As time passes over a 24-hour period the oxygen bubbles will not be able to escape and will cure directly inside the mold. With sufficient pressure these small cavitation holes will be invisible to the naked eye. Degassing mold casting Due to the nature of oxygen entrapment in epoxy during the pouring and curing period it is common to have distortions and cavitation in the final injection mold. Degassing the epoxy during the curing period will require the use of a vacuum chamber and will require a pressure of 100 kPa (29 inHg) in order to create near vacuum conditions. This can be achieved with the use of a 2-stage vacuum pump that is capable of 2 Pa (15 μmHg). Single use molds Injection molding through the use of a single 1 use injection can be achieved through the use of \\"plaster of paris\\" The mold will produce one solid part. However, the mold will break down after the first shot and will rarely allow for the injection of a second shot..

He is a Republican. Ulrich is a moderate Republican, breaking from conservatives on minimum wage legislation, his vocal opposition to President Donald Trump, and his support for rent stabilization. As City Councilman, he led oversight committees on Hurricane Sandy relief efforts, and publicly expressed disapproval with their speed and efficiency. Ulrich's constituents reside in parts of the Rockaway Peninsula and Howard Beach which were disproportionately affected by the storm. In public statements Ulrich called the relief efforts a \\"bureaucratic nightmare\\", said the city's chosen contractors were incapable of handling the residents' needs, and recommended the head of the city's Build-it-Back program be fired by the Mayor. Life and career Eric Ulrich was born at Jamaica Hospital on February 13, 1985. He grew up in Ozone Park in Queens, where he attended P.S. 63Q (Old South), a public elementary school, and later, Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary, a Catholic elementary school. Raised by his mother with the help of his maternal grandparents, Ulrich contemplated a vocation to the priesthood. After graduating from Cathedral Prep. Seminary High School in 2003, he became the first member of his family to earn a college degree. He holds a BA from St. Francis College and received his MPA in 2016 from Baruch College, City University of New York. Ulrich is divorced and has one daughter, Lily. While in college, Ulrich worked for the Transportation Security Administration at JFK Airport. He taught religion at Xaverian High School (Bay Ridge, Brooklyn). He previously served as the President of the Our Neighbors Civic Association of Ozone Park. He belongs to the Knights of Columbus, Kiwanis Club of Howard Beach, Jamaica Rotary Club, the National Political Science Honor Society-Pi Sigma Alpha, and was also elected to New York Republican State Committee (2007-2013). On February 24, 2009, at age 24 Ulrich won the non-partisan special election for New York City Council to replace Joseph Addabbo Jr. who was elected to New York State Senate in 2008. Ulrich was re-elected in 2009, 2013 and again in 2017. He is currently term-limited in 2021 and cannot seek re-election. New York City Council In February 2009, during a special election, Ulrich was elected to a seat on the New York City Council, defeating three more senior candidates in the 32nd district in southwest Queens. Ulrich was re-elected in November 2009, in 2013, and in 2017. He is barred by term limits from seeking re-election in 2021. Ulrich broke with the New York State Republican Party platform on several issues, and says he is proud of his independence from party positions. He voted in favor of a minimum wage raise and voted twice to boost rent stabilization, making him the only Republican to do so. Ulrich is one of only three Republicans in the New York City Council, and is the only one of the three not from Staten Island. He supported Melissa Mark-Viverito during her run for Council Speaker in 2013, an unpopular position for Republicans. Queens Republican Chair Bob Turner said that supporting Viverito \\"wouldn't help\\" Ulrich's standing in Republican circles. Ulrich had chided Mark-Viverito for refusing to recite the Pledge of Allegiance with other Council-members during government functions, a position she changed in 2013 prior to her run for Speaker. For fiscal year 2015, Ulrich secured a $400,000 allocation to support local veterans' direct services. Five organizations were nominated to help veterans and their families with employment, mental health, and legal issues. Funding also supports programming for women veterans and newly returned service members. He supports the consolidation of the city’s three library systems. =Hurricane Sandy recovery= Ulrich started a Committee with Mark Treyger to monitor the recovery effort following Hurricane Sandy. Ulrich sharply criticized the pace of the recovery effort during oversight meetings in 2015 and 2016. He pointed to Build-it-Back as ineffective, pointing to cases where homeowners had been relocated for construction, only to learn that months had gone by with no development. =Chair of New York Council Veterans Committee= Ulrich serves as Chair of the New York City Council's Veterans Committee. Following her election to Council Speaker (in which she had received support from Ulrich), Melissa Mark-Viverito appointed Ulrich to his Veterans Affairs post. Ulrich refuted speculation that his support for Viverito was a quid pro quo for obtaining his Committee Chairmanship, and instead said that supporting her was his best option for bringing her attention to the needs of his constituents. Since assuming the committee chairship in early 2014, Ulrich has held hearings on a range of topics examining local veterans' issues and how New York City government can combat these challenges. Following remarks by presidential candidate Donald Trump that John McCain was not a war hero, Ulrich rejected his comments, calling them \\"a slap in the face to New York City’s veterans and their families, especially those who had been 'captured' as former POWs.\\" Ulrich wrote a letter July 20, 2015 to Jamaica Hospital, urging the Board of Directors to remove Trump's name from the nursing home. The Trump Pavilion for Nursing and Rehabilitation was named after Mary Trump, and was built in 1975 with donations from Donald Trump's parents. The Trump name remains on the Pavilion. =Coronavirus; Oxiris Barbot = In early April 2020, he and New York City Councilman Democrat Robert Holden wrote to Mayor de Blasio asking him to relieve Commissioner of Health of the City of New York Oxiris Barbot of her position \\"before it’s too late,\\" saying her guidance on coronavirus had been disastrous. Other campaigns2012 State Senate bid= In 2012, Ulrich ran for New York State Senate against incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Addabbo in Senate District 15. While the Queens Republican Party endorsed a lesser-known challenger against him in the primary, Ulrich prevailed nonetheless. During the campaign, Ulrich criticized Sen. Addabbo, who publicly said there was \\"an understanding\\" that Resorts World Casino in Queens would hire 70-80% locally from Queens. The Daily News found that 61% of the \\"top tier\\" positions were held by employees residing in Queens County. On Election Day, Ulrich was defeated by Addabbo. =Potential run for Mayor of New York City= Media speculated that Ulrich was a potential challenger to Bill De Blasio in the 2017 mayoral race, after his 2013 press conference on an unplowed street in Queens, criticizing the newly elected mayor for his handling of the heavy snowfall. Ulrich launched an exploratory committee on May 12, 2016, but did not ultimately run. =Comments on 2016 presidential campaign= Ulrich endorsed John Kasich over Trump during his presidential run in 2016. When Trump became the presumptive nominee, Ulrich said he disliked Trump's offensive comments and speeches, but said he may vote for him should he \\"come around by [Election Day]\\". =2019 New York City Public Advocate special election= Ulrich ran in the 2019 New York City Public Advocate special election. As the election was nonpartisan, Ulrich ran on the line titled Common Sense. Some of his endorsements included the Bronx GOP, Brooklyn GOP, Manhattan GOP, Queens GOP, and Staten Island GOP, as well as the New York Daily News, which, on February 20, 2019, wrote \\"Ulrich stands apart on a key issue of the day: He welcomed Amazon coming to Long Island City as the rest of the field was tripping over itself to denounce the deal.\\" http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/ny-edit-public-advocate-20190218-story.html In addition to supporting Amazon coming to New York City, Ulrich is the only candidate to have opposed Mayor Bill de Blasio's plan to close Riker's Island and build community jails. In a debate that aired on NY1 in early February, Ulrich vowed to be Mayor de Blasio's \\"worst nightmare\\" if elected as Public Advocate. In February 2019, New York Post contributor John Podhoretz wrote a column entitled \\"A Republican with a real chance to win an NYC-wide office,\\" https://nypost.com/2019/02/13/a-republican-with-a-real-chance-to-win-an-nyc- wide-office/ which was featured in the New York Post. Podhoretz's column cites private polling - not commissioned by Ulrich or any of the campaigns - “that suggests Ulrich has a real shot at winning” the special election, leading with 22 percent.

It is located along the Ottawa River, just south of Lachute. History Carillon, being located at the foot of the Long-Sault rapids on the Ottawa River, has a long history. It started out as a trading post at the beginning of the seventeenth century, and then a relay station for voyageurs. Here in 1660, Adam Dollard des Ormeaux and his companions saved New France from attack by the Iroquois during the Battle of Long Sault, according to tradition. However, evidence was found of a burnt palisade in the vicinity of the earthworks of the present dam constructed on the opposite side in present day Ontario. In 1671, an officer of the Carignan Regiment, Philippe Carion (Carrion), obtained the area as a concession in the Montreal Island Seigneury from Dollier de Casson and established a trading post. But the name Carillon was reported in 1686 in the journal of Chevalier de Troyes. Around 1800, settlers of Scottish origin settled at the confluence of the North River (Rivière du Nord) and Rouge River near the Ottawa River. In 1819, the post office with the English name of St. Andrews East (Frenchified to Saint-André-Est in 1978) was established here, having adopted the name of the patron saint of the Scottish settlers. Also here two years later in 1821, John Joseph Caldwell Abbott, Prime Minister of Canada from 1891 to 1892, was born. In 1845, the Argenteuil Municipality was founded, but was abolished two years later. In 1855, the Parish Municipality of Saint-André-d'Argenteuil was formed. In the nineteenth century, the timber industry was very active in this section of the Laurentian Mountains and the first paper mill in Canada was built on this land in 1803. From the 1830s onward, Carillon became the site of the Carillon Canal, built to facilitate military transport up the Ottawa River. It was enlarged in the 1870s to accommodate commercial boat traffic. Today it is a National Historic Site of Canada. In 1959, construction began on the Carillon Generating Station and dam, raising the Ottawa River water level by over at Carillon, flooding the rapids of Long-Sault and transforming them into calm water. Carillon and Saint-André-Est became independent municipalities in 1887 and 1958 respectively, their territories being separated from the Parish Municipality of Saint-André-d'Argenteuil. But on December 29, 1999, the Village Municipality of Saint-André-Est, the Village Municipality of Carillon, and the Parish Municipality of Saint- André-d'Argenteuil were rejoined into the new Municipality of Saint- André–Carillon, which was renamed on November 25, 2000, to Saint- André-d'Argenteuil.

Early life Guelfo Zamboni was born at Santa Sofia, then part of Tuscany on 22 October 1896. The last of eight sons, he belonged to a family devoted to handicrafts. His parents wanted him to become a clergyman, but they died early in his life and left him an orphan. He decided to attend school when he became older and faced the hardship of earning a living while studying. At 19 he fought as an infantryman in World War I, from 1916 to 1918, and was honored with a Bronze Medal of Military Valor and a War Merit Cross as he had been seriously wounded. After the war he received a degree in Economics and Trade. In 1925 he took the exam that began him in his diplomatic career. Traditionally, the Italian Foreign Ministry had been dominated by the aristocracy and Zamboni was one of the first Italian diplomats to come from a modest background. Zamboni had been able enter the diplomatic corps because Benito Mussolini had abolished the requirement that those applying for a diplomatic career submit a notarized statement proving that they were from families in a high income bracket, a policy that had excluded Italians of middle-class or lower-class background from entering the diplomatic corps. After serving in the international treaty section of the Foreign Ministry, Zamboni had served in the Italian embassies in Tirana and Helsinki. He went on to be an associate of Baron Bernardo Attolico, the Italian Ambassador in Berlin between 1935 and 40. Under the Germanophile Attolico's tutelage, he learned and became fluent in German. Zamboni complained that he had been prevented from marrying in his youth because of a Fascist law that prevented Italian citizens from marrying foreigners, which he called \\"another one of Mussolini's acts of foolishness.\\" As the chargé d'affaires in Berlin, serving as the right-hand man to Baron Attolico, Zamboni found himself executing a policy of rapprochment with the Reich that he did not agree with, saying: \\"Even though the Germans were our allies, I had to salve my own conscience.\\" On 11 July 1940 as the Italian chargé d'affaires, Zamboni submitted a formal note of protest to Baron Ernst von Weizsäcker against the German demand to have naval and air bases in French Morocco, which Mussolini saw as a threat to Italian ambitions to annex Algeria after the war. In response, Weizsäcker stated that the Reich had no intention of giving up its interest in bases in French Morocco, but was willing to accept Italian bases in Algeria as compensation. Besides for Attolico, Zamboni found another aristocratic patron in Viceré Marchese Francesco Jacomoni, a diplomat who was regarded as a lackey for the Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo Ciano. In 1939, after Italy occupied Albania, Jacomoni was appointed Viceroy of Albania and Zamboni ultimately followed his patron across the Strait of Otranto to Tirana. Had the Italian invasion of Greece in 1940 succeeded, Zamboni was due to be appointed governor of Epirus. Zamboini was unable to take up this appointment on the account of the Greeks defeating the Italian invasion. Rescuing the Jews of Thessaloniki Following the German invasion of Greece in April 1941 and the occupation of the country by Nazi Germany, Italy, and Bulgaria, in 1942 Zamboni was appointed Consul General in Thessaloniki, the second largest city in Greece, which was occupied by Germany. The appointment was a promotion, as Thessaloniki was the headquarters of Army Group E that consisted of all the Wehrmacht forces in the Balkans, putting Zamboni in charge of relations with Field Marshal Alexander Löhr who served as the military governor of the areas occupied by Army Group E. The American historian Jonathan Steinberg called Zamboni a \\"tiny, lively and combative\\" man who spoke his Italian with a strong Romagna accent. In November 1942, the Germans had shut down all consulates in Thessaloniki except the Italian one. For much of World War I, Thessaloniki, the largest Jewish city in the Balkans, had been occupied by the French Army (the \\"Salonika Front\\") and many of the French soldiers had married Jewish women during the occupation. The French consulate in Thessaloniki had in 1941-42 repeatedly complained about the Germans harassing French citizens living in the city, causing the Germans to shut down all consulates except the Italian one to end this issue. Every week, Zamboni sent reports to Rome detailing social conditions in Thessaloniki that is one of the main sources for historians for this period.. At that time, Thessaloniki hosted the world's largest community (56,000) of Sephardi Jews, many of whom could claim familial connections to Italy. In June 1942, the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg began the systematic confiscation of the city's archives, libraries, and manuscripts, all of which were sent to the Institute for Jewish Studies in Frankfurt am Main. Between March and August 1943 the Germans deported nearly all of Thessaloniki's Jewish population to concentration and death camps. On 15 March 1943, the first train full of Jews left Thessaloniki for the Auschwitz death camp. As the only consulate left in Thessaloniki, many of the Jews put their hopes in Zamboni's goodwill. Everyday, the consulate received dozens of Jews, asking for help. Taking pity, Zamboni decided to do something to help. In an interview in 1992, Zamboni recalled: \\"They would plead and cry, they would kneel and throw themselves at my feet and try to kiss my shoes. I was afraid that all this commotion would attract too much attention\\". On 27 March 1943, Zamboni asked Dr. Max Merten where the Jews were going, and was told that they were being sent to work in coal mines near Warsaw, but soon, Zamboni was able to establish that the Jews sent to Poland where in fact being exterminated. Zamboni could not prevent the tragedy, but he did everything he could to rescue Jews of Thessaloniki. He also managed to extend provisional Italian citizenship to 280 Greek Jews. These certificates of Italian nationality, with the handwritten mark \\"provisional\\", were handed to many people who did not speak or understand Italian, made quasi-legal by claiming distant relatives. He later said: Their number eventually reached 350. Zamboni thus saved them from deportation as well. Zamboni stated: \\"I couldn't demonstrate that these people were Italian citizens, but I could claim that the nationalisation procedure was under way.\\" One of the Jews whom Zamboi saved, Moise Nahmias recalled in a television interview: \\"At the consulate they gave me a certificate that was valid for one year that stated my name, date of birth and Italian nationality. In reality I was a Greek, born in Salonika and my only link to Italy was my wife's parents who were born in Trieste.\\" The man in charge of deporting the Jews of Greece, SS Dieter Wisliceny criticized Zamboni, saying that he knew perfectly well that none of the Jews that Zamboni claimed were Italian citizens were really Italians, leading Zamboni to reply: \\"As long as the Italian flag flies here, under this flag I am the only one who decides what to do or what not to do\\". Wisliceny believed that Zamboni had been bribed into issuing false Italian passports and spread rumors about he what claimed was \\"scandalous\\" corruption in the Italian consulate, but there is no evidence that Zamboni ever asked for or received financial rewards. In his study of the Axis occupation of Greece, the British historian Mark Mazower wrote that all of the evidence indicates that Zamboni had acted for humanitarian reasons. Drita Djomo, a local woman with a Greek father and an Italian mother who worked as a translator at the consulate called the Italian consulate the \\"hideout of hope\\". She recalled in a 2017 interview: \\"With instructions from the consul I would falsify the papers and he would sign off on them. He was a very good man, he had no interest in Mussolini's fascism, and he helped many Jews. Everything would happen in absolute secrecy. The consul would never talk about what we were doing. Each of us knew our job. The man with the connections to incarcerated Greek Jews in the ghetto was Lucillo Merci, an Italian officer who worked as a German-Italian interpreter. We would make documents claiming that they had an Italian grandmother or something like that. Merci would then take them by car to the town of Plati in Imathia where the last German control checkpoint was and enter the areas occupied by Italy...\\" Zamboni left Thessaloniki on 18 June 1943 to return to Rome. His work in rescuing Jews was continued by his successor, Giuseppe Castruccio. Castruccio would later organize a \\"rescue train\\" that transported Jews with Italian passports to Athens, which at that time was under Italian occupation. Zamboni's behaviour was observed by one of his coworkers, Captain Lucillo Merci, a liaison officer with the German forces and the author of a detailed diary of those events. By August 1943, 98% of the Jews who had been living in Thessaloniki in March were dead. Castruccio in a telegram to Rome wrote: \\"On August 14 the last train with Jews left Thessaloniki headed for Germany. On the 15th the SS officers left via plane. The Jewish community that existed before the discovery of America does not exist anymore\\". Post-war After the war's end, Zamboni was put in charge of diplomatic missions in Baghdad and in Thailand. He was the Italian Ambassador in Bangkok until 1961. In 1963, he retired from the diplomatic corps and lived in obscurity for decades afterward. In 1992, the State of Israel awarded Guelfo Zamboni with the title of \\"Righteous among the Nations\\", which is awarded to those who saved Jews during the Holocaust at personal risk to themselves and who acted for purely altruistic reasons. He was thus awarded a place in Jerusalem's Yad Vashem. In 2002, Ehud Gol, the Israeli Ambassador in Italy, traveled to Santa Sofia to place a stone in Zamboni's memory. Guelfo Zamboni never asked for recognition for his aid and remained quite unknown in Italy until the eve of his 95th birthday (1992), when he gave his first interview after being awarded the title of \\"Righteous among the Nations\\". In 2008, the Italian Embassy in Athens published the book Ebrei di Salonicco 1943, i documenti dell'umanità italiana, edited by Antonio Ferrari (Corriere della Sera), Alessandra Coppola (University of Padua), and Jannis Chrisafis (a Greek journalist). This book reports the telex sent to Rome by Zamboni. His story also inspired the theatrical work Salonicco '43 by Ferdinando Ceriani, Gian Paolo Cavarai and Antonio Ferrari, previewed at the University of Tel Aviv on 23 September 2008 during a celebratory evening organized by the Italian Cultural Institute.

Hersh graduated from West Chester Teachers College in 1953. He was inducted into that institution's Athletic Hall of Fame. A two-sport athlete, Hersh was recognized separately, in both football (1982), and baseball (1992). An end, he was also drafted by the National Football League (NFL) Philadelphia Eagles, in the 27th round of the 1953 NFL Draft, but elected to play baseball, professionally. In , Hersh won the American Association RBI title, while playing for the Wichita Braves. On May 28, 1959, he was traded to the Detroit Tigers as part of a four-player deal, but was returned to the Braves system when another player involved in the trade refused to report to his new team. A curious fact is that all three of Hersh's big league hits were doubles, which ties him with Verdo Elmore and Dennis Powell for the most hits in an MLB career, where all of the player's hits were two-baggers.

The village is located at about 6 km north of Pattukkottai on Pattukkottai - Kumbakonam highway & 350 km South from the state capital, Chennai. The village follows the Panchayati raj system, where every 5 years the Panchayat President will be democratically elected by the people. Thittakkudi panchayat consists of two villages Thittakkudi & Soorangadu. Currently the village is undergoing transformation under the panchayat. Efforts have been made for empowerment of women and lower-middle- class people in the village. The main purpose of the village President is to give very good basic facilities for all the people. This Picture is took during Ayyanar Kovil Thiruvilla side view  People  The population consists predominantly of Hindus. They belong to Vellalar, a dominant caste in Pattukkottai taluk. They are all mostly farmers. In recent years the traditional system has lost its relevance and people from different castes are seen in the same field.  History  Thittakkudi is the head of all the 32 Musugundan Community villages located in and around Pattukkottai. Sri Sivan Kovil temple is the most important Hindu temple in Thittakkudi and is of considerable antiquity. There is also other temples like Sri Aiyanar Kovil, Sri Vairavan Kovil in the Village. The Poovandi pond on the Pattukkottai - Kumbakonam highway is one of few famous ponds in this area. Musugundhan is name of a community in India, located in Tamil Nadu State, Thanjavur District, that comprises 32 villages. The community is named after a king who ruled a part of South India. Community in this place in the modern era is classified as Velallar, a dominant caste of Tamil Nadu state of India and particularly in Pattukkottai taluk.  Demographics  The population of Thittakkudi was roughly 1000 as per 2001 census of India which increased to 1500 in 2011 census of India.  Education  There is one small primary school in Thittakkudi started in 1990. There are around 50 students enrolled in this school. According to the Indian School Report Card, this school is under developed. The biggest challenge for the villagers is to make this school a better place for students. There is also a library near the school which contains hundreds of books of different kinds. There are only few people regularly using this facility. We need to improve this facility and encourage more people to read books. It is located on the Pattukkottai - Kumbakonam highway near Sri Sivan Kovil temple.  Sports  Volleyball and kabaddi are the primary games for the village youngsters. Cricket, football and other sports are also of some importance. Often Thittakkudi is one of the top teams and winners in the community tournament. Every year on Pongal sports events will be conducted for kids & youngsters.  Water & Other Facilities  The panchayat had installed a number of bore wells in recent years to ensure the supply of clean drinking water to the villagers. During weddings and other ceremonies, 24 hours water facilities are arranged. Drinking water taps are available within reach for all. The panchayat also planning to make every household has a proper sanitation and drainage system, which is completely underground. Roads have been built on every possible places with street lights and lamps.  Economy  The main occupation in this area is agriculture. Coconuts and rice are the main crops. Peanuts, bananas, corn, and sugarcane are also grown. Most of the crop cultivating grounds are modified to Coconut farms due to lack of manpower, water and electricity shortage. There is no industry in this village. There used to be a small factory to process coconut seeds but it was closed down a few years ago. Historically young men go to abroad to earn money for the families. Often they go to places such as Singapore, Malaysia, the Middle East, Canada, USA, Ireland - Dublin and United Kingdom - London.  Administration  The Thittakkudi panchayat was bifurcated from Sendangadu panchayat in the 1970s. Since then a number of facilities have been built by the panchayat. Currently Mr. A. Rengasamy M.Sc., M.Phil., is the President of the Thittakkudi panchayat since 2011. The following is the list of people who headed the panchayat in the past. #Mr. A.

They play in the Midlands Premier division of the Rugby League Conference. History Birmingham Bulldogs were founded in 1989. The club's first season was in 1989–90 in the Midlands and South West Amateur Rugby League Association (MASWARLA) competition; a runners-up spot in the Heart of England Nines was followed by a programme of fixtures against local rivals such as Redditch Halcyon and West Midlands Police. The season culminated in a nail-biting encounter against Redditch in the MASWARLA Cup Final in Stroud, Gloucestershire. Birmingham were edged out 12–8 with a try in the dying minutes. In the 1990 - 91 season the team was reinforced by a number of rugby union recruits. The club won their first silverware with the MASWARLA Challenge Plate in a final played at Worcester RUFC. The 1991–92 season saw Birmingham just fail to retain the Challenge Plate against the West Midlands Police RLFC, despite retaining the core of the successful team from the previous season. The side began to flourish in 1994/5, winning the Heart of England Nines trophy in 1995 and notching up a notable cup win over established Doncaster side Bentley-Yarborough in 1996. The 1995 - 96 season brought more success as Birmingham captured the East Midlands League title, were runners up in the League's Cup final, won the Brennan Trophy in most dramatic fashion, had their first ever win in the National Cup and then hosted the Yorkshire Cup holders Queens, from Leeds. The Southern Conference was launched in 1997 and was aimed at areas relatively new to the game. Birmingham played in the very first fixture in this new competition away at Leicester Phoenix and scored the first ever points, a drop-goal from Tony Williams, and the first ever try, from James Brabin. The game eventually finished 36 –23 to Leicester but Birmingham went on to the play-offs after finishing second in the Central Division, behind Leicester. The semi-final saw Birmingham play the winners of the Eastern division, North London Skolars in London. Skolars took an 18-point lead before Birmingham came back and the game eventually finished with Skolars holding on to win the semi-final 18 – 16. In 1998, Birmingham adopted the name Birmingham Bulls as they had a connection with the Super League side Bradford Bulls. They rebranded again in 2000 to become Birmingham Bulldogs to avoid a legal challenge by Birmingham Bulls American football team. The 2000 Rugby league Conference season saw the club finish top of their division. They then went on to reach the quarter finals of the competition where they were defeated 29-27 points by Rotherham Giants. The 2003 season saw the club finish top of their division and after pay-off wins against Nottingham and Mansfield travelled to the semi-final against Carlisle Centurions. The Bulldogs eventually found their match in a Carlisle side and went down 44 – 2. Following the success of the previous season the club applied to join National league 3 in 2004 and were successful. The club's first fixture in National League 3 was a repeat of the previous years semi- final with an away trip to Carlisle Centurions. The Bulldogs set down a marker for the rest of the season and scored a 30 – 20 win. This set the tone for the rest of the season and the Bulldogs eventually finished eighth and progressed to the play-offs where they were just pipped by Coventry Bears. Midway through the 2005 season, the club had to withdraw from the competition and revert to playing in the Midlands Regional division of the Rugby League Conference. In 2006, the club re-established itself in the Rugby League Conference Midlands Premier Division. Russell Parker was appointed as a full-time Community Rugby League Coach for Birmingham in 2007. This significant stride forward for the sport in the city matched equivalent appointments throughout the Midlands. Following the work in local schools a junior section was soon established at the club, with teams at various age groups competing at numerous festivals throughout the Midlands during the season. The club saw much improved performances during the season in the RLC Midlands Premier but missed out on the end of season play-offs. Russell Parker's appointment as Senior Head Coach in 2008, the club's development continued with the formation of a second open- age team early in the RL Merit League which reached the semi-final play-offs where they narrowly lost to Sheffield Forgers. The club also worked hard behind the scenes at its development work and successfully applied for Clubmark status. In a major close-season change, the club relocated from its Moor Lane home of many years to nearby Aston Old Edwardians rugby union in 2009. The club continued with two Open Age teams competing in the RLC Midlands Premier and the renamed Midlands Rugby League. The RLC Midlands competition came down to four teams competing for top spot in the final round of the season. In a 'winner takes all' clash against Coventry Bears, the Bulldogs lost narrowly to the eventual winners and missed out on the play-offs. The Bulldogs second team topped the Midlands Rugby League after the regular season. The club had its revenge against Coventry Bears in the semi-final to set up a final against North Derbyshire Chargers. Following an early deficit they fought back to win the game and win the club's first silverware since 1996. At junior level the Bulldogs competed at under-12, under-14 and under-16 in the newly established Midlands Junior League. In 2010, the club linked up with Super League side Hull F.C.

It was built by Dräger in Lübeck, Germany in 1968 for the Biological Institute Helgoland, and was the first of its kind in the world built for use in colder waters. It is named after the island Helgoland. The habitat allowed divers to spend several weeks under water using saturation diving techniques. The scientists and technicians would live and work in the laboratory, returning to it after every diving session. Only once they had reached the end of their stay did they decompress in the UWL itself, being able to then resurface without coming to any harm. After experience gained in the first deployment, a wet section was added. The UWL was used in the waters of the North and Baltic Seas and, in 1975, on Jeffreys Ledge, in the Gulf of Maine along the coast of New England in the United States.http://stellwagen.noaa.gov/library/pdfs/banknotes_sprsum2011.pdf History The station was delivered to the GKSS Research Center in Geesthacht in 1972. It was used until 1981 in the Baltic Sea, the North Sea and the North Atlantic. The first stage of deployment was in 1969 off Helgoland. During this deployment Karl-Heinz Schumann and the student Winfried Kreytenberg died on 6 December 1969 at a depth of 25 meters south-east of the island Düne during work on the underwater laboratory while disconnecting the underwater laboratory and the supply line.„Friedhof der Namenlosen“, die tageszeitung, 22.

On September 25, 1975, German aquanaut Joachim Wendler died of an air embolism while returning to the surface of the Gulf of Maine from Helgoland. He was participating in a checkout mission for the First International Saturation Study of Herring and Hydroacoustics (FISSHH) project. and , cited in Miller and Koblick, pp. 117, 264. At the end of the 1970s the laboratory was decommissioned, and in the summer of 1998 it was donated to the German Oceanographic Museum by the GKSS Research Centre, Geesthacht. It can be visited at the Nautineum, an outpost of the museum in Stralsund. Technical data The interior of the UWL Helgoland consists of a living area 2.5 m long, an instrumentation and engine room 6.5 m long and since 1973 a wet laboratory 4 m long. With a diameter of 2.5 m, this provided a useful area of 32.5 m2. The laboratory provided all necessary facilities for a stay of several weeks on the seabed. The internal pressure was the same as the external pressure, and decompression from saturation was done at the end of the mission. The habitat had air conditioning and good thermal insulation. It was lowered by flooding the ballast tanks with seawater, and raised by blowing the water out of the tanks using compressed air.

The League of Nations was established by the Great Powers as part of the Paris Peace Treaties, the international settlement that followed the First World War. The creation of a general association of nations was the final one of President Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. The LNU became the largest and most influential organisation in the British peace movement. By the mid-1920s, it had over a quarter of a million registered subscribers and its membership eventually peaked at around 407,775 in 1931. By the 1940s, after the disappointments of the international crises of the 1930s and the descent into World War II, membership fell to about 100,000. Formation The LNU was formed on 13 October 1918 by the merger of the League of Free Nations Association and the League of Nations Society, two older organisations already working for the establishment of a new and transparent system of international relations, human rights (as then understood) and for world peace through disarmament and universal collective security, rather than traditional approaches such as the balance of power and the creation of power blocs through secret treaties. Chapters of the LNU were set up in the dominions and in allied nations, including in the capital cities of all of the states of Australia. Internal structure The headquarters of the LNU were located variously at Buckingham Gate and Grosvenor Crescent, Belgravia. In the 1940s, it moved to smaller premises in St Martin's Lane, WC2, for reasons of economy.Archives of League Of Nations Union, 1918-1971. Its top organ of administration was the General Council, which met twice a year and was responsible for LNU policy under its 1925 Royal Charter of Incorporation. Beneath the General Council sat the Executive Committee, which met every two weeks and co-ordinated all activities, such as the LNU's campaigns and educational programmes; received reports from branches; monitored the output of specialist sub-groups and had responsibility for the LNU's staff. LNU branches had their own independent management structures. Activities The LNU played an important role in inter-war politics. According to one source it had been successful in converting the mainstream of British society, including labour, the churches and the principal newspapers, to the cause of the League of Nations. It also carried great influence in traditional political circles and particularly in the Liberal Party. One historian has gone so far as to describe the LNU as \\"a key Liberal pressure group on foreign policy\\" and to call Liberal Party members the \\"true believers\\" of the LNU. Its first president was Edward Grey the Liberal foreign secretary during the First World War. Other leading Liberal lights in the LNU included Geoffrey Mander Liberal MP for Wolverhampton East from 1929 to 1945 and Professor Gilbert Murray, who was this Vice-President of the League of Nations Society from 1916 and Chairman of the LNU after 1923. The recruitment of Conservative politicians to support the LNU and the League of Nations itself was more problematic for the LNU, but they pursued it to demonstrate the cross-party nature of the Union, which was important for the credibility of an organisation active politically in pursuit of international goals. High-profile Conservatives then came into the LNU, notably Lord Robert Cecil and Austen Chamberlain who were both members of the LNU Executive Committee. However, most Conservatives were deeply suspicious of the LNU's support for pacifism and disarmament, an analogous position being the opinions held by Conservatives in the 1980s in respect of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Even Austen Chamberlain remarked that the Executive Committee contained \\"some of the worst cranks I have ever known\\". Winston Churchill said of the Union: \\"What impresses me most about them is their long suffering and inexhaustible gullibility\\".HC Deb 23 November 1932 vol 272 cc73-211 =Peace Ballot= One example of the significance of the political impact the LNU could have was its organisation of the Peace Ballot of 1935, when voters were asked to decide on questions relating to international disarmament and collective security. The Peace Ballot was not an official referendum, but more than eleven million people participated in it, representing strong support for the aims and objectives of the League of Nations, influencing policy makers and politicians. The results of the Peace Ballot were publicised worldwide. It has been suggested that one outcome was the interpretation of the result by the Axis powers as an indication of Britain's unwillingness to go to war on behalf of other nations although the vote for military action against international aggressors, as a matter of last resort, was almost three-to-one. =Educational programmes= The LNU's other main activities were education and awareness raising. It provided publications, speakers and organised courses. Some of its programmes had a lasting impact on British schools.British Library of Political and Economic Science, League of Nations Union, 1918-1971. Replacement by United Nations Association It was plain a new international settlement would be needed after the Second World War and in 1948, the United Nations Association (UNA) was founded to promote the work of the United Nations Organisation, which was established in 1945 after the previous year's Dumbarton Oaks Conference. As a result, the LNU arranged for the transfer of its complete organisation and membership to the UNA. However, under the provisions of its Royal Charter, the LNU was able to continue until the mid-1970s in a limited capacity to handle bequests and administer the payment of pensions to former employees. Papers and records The papers, records, minute books, pamphlets, reports and leaflets of the LNU are deposited at the British Library of Political and Economic Science at the London School of Economics in Westminster.

The series revolves around Setsuna Kashiwagi, a Japanese high school student with a chronic heart problem who makes a deal with an Oni for 10 million yen in exchange for his life in a year. He is soon met by Kanna and Rena, two princesses of the Royal Oni Clan who act as bodyguards to protect his heart from other Oni in exchange for one of them eating his heart after the year has passed. Onihime VS debuted in the special \\"Hard\\" issue of Kill Time Communication's male-oriented manga magazine Comic Valkyrie, and began regular serialization in Comic Valkyrie afterwards. The first bound volume was released in Japan on September 30, 2008, and the fourth volume was released on November 2, 2012. The series had a long hiatus from July 27, 2010 to January 27, 2012, resuming serialization in Comic Valkyrie following the finale of Unbalance Unbalance, and ending serialization in the November 2012 issue. Synopsis Setsuna Kashiwagi's only desire is for his sister to live a happy life. Weak, frail, and constantly bullied, Setsuna believes he is nothing but a burden to his sister and decides to take his own life. As he prepares to jump off a bridge, a mysterious man appears and presents him with an unusual offer. He offers 10 million yen in exchange for Setsuna's life. If he accepts the contract, after one year, Setsuna will end his life in a manner the man chooses. Skeptical at first, Setsuna accepts. The next morning, thinking it was all just a dream, Setsuna awakens to find two beautiful women sitting beside him. They are Kanna and Rena, Oni princesses who have come to protect Setsuna. The catch: one of them will consume his heart in one year. After drinking a potion to seal the deal, the host's (in this case Setsuna's) heart will absorb the combined power of the Oni tribe and will ferment increasing that power until it ripens after one year. However, demons will be able to sense the power and want to eat the heart themselves to gain that power even if the Banrikou Heart isn't fully ripe yet. So to protect the heart and determine who gets to eat it at the end of the year (thus becoming the new leader of the Oni,) the princesses guard and live with the host for the year with the winner being decided by which one is summoned the most to protect the heart. However, the one summoned is whichever one the host feels or thinks about more at that time. Any demon is allowed to try to steal the heart without it being a crime as the contestants are only considered fit to rule if they can protect the Heart. But while protecting the Heart the contestants can do whatever they please, up to and including death, to any demon making an attempt to steal the Heart. The host has to be human, has to know that they're going to die at the end of the year, be suicidal enough to be willing to die but not so much as to kill themselves before the Heart is harvested, and drink the potion of their own free will without threats or coercion. In exchange they'll (or rather whoever they will it to) receive 10 million Yen once the Heart is harvested. Advanced payment or the contestants using any of their share of the Oni Family money during that year is against clan law. Thus the host has to provide for the contestants out of their own pocket, although receiving money from the contestants earning it by doing jobs is ok.  Characters  Humans = ; :A high school student in the care of his older sister ever since their parents died. Setsuna was born with a weak heart and has been the victim of bullying through most of his life. Overhearing a conversation between his sister and loan sharks, he feels that his life has been just a burden to his sister and decides to commit suicide. Literally on the edge of the bridge, he is confronted by a mysterious man known as the \\"Middleman\\". Middleman offers him 10 million yen to postpone his suicide by one year. After Setsuna accepts, he drinks the \\"Banrikou\\" as proof of their contract. He wakes up the next morning, thinking it was all a dream until he sees two girls sitting beside him. They introduce themselves as Kanna and Rena, princess sisters from the Oni clan. They explain further that because his Banrikou heart now gives off a scent that attracts demons, they have been sent to protect him until his heart fully matures. If he is attacked by a demon, Setsuna will be able to summon one of the sisters, whomever one he thinks of the most. At the end of the year, once his heart has fully matured, the sister Setsuna summoned the most will consume his heart to obtain the ultimate form. Ever since Setsuna drank Banrikou, his heart problems have disappeared. Although he appears weak and indecisive he really is noble hearted and gentle to the point where he let little kids bully him to protect Kanna (who had forgotten she was strong from a love potion that's only supposed to be used on men) rather than fighting back and hurting them. That and protecting Kanna's feelings while she had amnesia by not telling her she might be eating his heart at the end of a year or taking advantage of her even when she threw herself on him. As such this attracts the feelings of Kanna, Rena, and even Erionelle. Thanks to a Zombie Oni ritual Erionelle used on him at the end of the series his days of being fought over by the sisters, Erionelle and Shoko are going to continue for a while. :Though an introvert, Setsuna has a caring side that surfaces occasionally. He has shown considerable bravery for the sake of protecting the ones close to him. :It is unclear who Setsuna has feelings for. He has shown interest in Kanna, Rena, and Arima. With recent events at the hot springs, it is hinted that Setsuna may have stronger feelings for Kanna although it could just be admiration. ; :Setsuna's kind-hearted older sister who become Setsuna's guardian after the death of their parents. Mirei has sacrificed everything and tried her best to take care of Setsuna, even borrowing money from loan sharks to pay for hospital fees. When Kanna and Rena appeared, she was in tears over the fact that her brother was able to make friends. Mirei has offered their home to Kanna and Rena but is still completely unaware of Setsuna's imminent death. ; :Setsuna's classmate and constant bully, along with her two friends. Both beautiful and popular, she picks on him to cover up the fact that she has a huge crush on him, something she has a hard time admitting to herself due to her tsundere personality. After being possessed by a low-level demon she jumps him in the storage room only to be rejected, causing Shoko and the demon feeding on her negative emotions to go berserk and attack Setsuna. However, Setsuna summons Kanna and Rena, with Kanna easily overpowering the possessed Shoko and Rena able to successfully remove the demon from Shoko. :After finding out how close Setsuna was with Kanna and Rena, Shoko began to see them as potential rivals. As the story progresses, Shoko has slowly started to get her feelings across to Setsuna. In one instant after being drugged, Shoko practically flirted with Setsuna, and while she was half-asleep she said to him that she wasn't going to let Kanna and Rena take him away because he was her \\"servant\\". Due to her Tsundere personality she hides her fears and insecurities (such as hiding that she likes Setsuna by bullying him to get attention.) :Even though she is the sole heiress to the Arima Group, she is at odds with her parents and lives alone in an apartment. However, after she became Hina's master due to the Brand of Domination, Hina has moved in to take care of the household chores. Although Shoko treats Hina as a servant/slave most of the time, she does show that she cares about Hina occasionally such as saying if Hina wants out than to find a way to break the contract and won't mind it if Hina does break the contract. =Oni= ; :The Middleman is a demon who dresses up as a gentleman, complete with a suit, top-hat and monocle. He seeks out people who no longer see a value in their own life and offers them a deal, they live for a year before having their heart eaten and dying at the end of the year for a million Yen. He also makes sure the chosen individual understands that they will definitely die at the end of the year, but doesn't hesitate to point out the benefits to the deal over killing themselves then and there To seal the deal, he has the person drink a potion called the \\"Banrikou\\", which marinates the heart in question with the combined power and wisdom of the Oni Clan to be devoured by the one who paid for it at the end of the year. This potion causes the heart to give off an aroma which lures other demons who'd want the power contained in it. So the competitor who is summoned the most to protect the heart wins the right to eat it at the end of the year. He also appears to be a bit of a flake, as Kanna commented that he always forgets to inform the customers of little details such as that the sisters who 'bought' and will eat his heart at the end of the year will be living with him for that year. Or that lesser demons will be attracted by the scent of his heart and try to consume it on the spot themselves. ; :Also known as from the Royal Oni clan, Kanna is the older of the two sisters. She wields a powerful \\"Golden Staff\\" (kanabō) that acts as a bludgeoning weapon, which makes her a powerhouse. Kanna is loud, brash, and likes to approach problems head-on. Despite her personality, when it comes to her family, she is willing to sacrifice her status as royalty to ensure their safety. With her voluptuous figure, she teases Setsuna to get him to think only of her. She became a teacher at Setsuna's school in order to be with him at all times. Because demons eat much more than humans (about 2-3 times as much, but she eats 5 times as much,) she has also taken a job as a hostess to help with expenses. Although she is only seen at that job on the day she was hired and if she kept the job even after becoming Setsuna's homeroom teacher at school isn't shown. She is a Power type Oni who inherited Speed from the previous transcended leader (meaning the leader won and ate the Banrikou Heart gaining extreme power in the previous contest,) so she excels in both strength and speed. Her preferred fighting method is using raw power to smash he enemies in a Full Frontal Assault. As a result the area she fights in tends to get damaged as well. Hina even remarks to Shoko that on powers alone, Kanna is the strongest member of the tribe rendering front attacks as pointless gestures. :After accidentally drinking a love potion and experiencing memory loss as the side effect, Kanna developed a new personality. She became a very shy, polite, and naïve girl. This led to her being easily deceived by Rena's jokes and unable to defend herself from little kids when bullied despite being older and extremely much stronger. Although the love potion was meant for males, it still had an effect on Kanna, who became enamored with Setsuna. Whether this was her true feelings or an effect of the love potion is hard to tell, but she feels Setsuna is a very special person to her even if she can't remember why. Kanna fell deeper in love with Setsuna for his caring personality and willingness to protect her. When she confessed her love for him, Setsuna stopped her and claimed that her feelings were due to the effects of the potion. Determined to prove that her feelings are real, Kanna vowed to confess again once her memories returned. After she recovered her memories, it seemed almost for a moment that Kanna had returned to normal with no recall of the events during her amnesia. However, a quick glance from Setsuna caused Kanna to blush, hinting that she, at the very least, remembered her confession to Setsuna. Towards the end of the series how much she remembers of her time while having amnesia is further revealed along with how much Setsuna and the Banrikou Heart mean to her. She also states how she's having so much fun in the more interesting human world that staying for a year is not enough which surprises everyone. ; :Also known as the , Rena is Kanna's younger sister from the Royal Oni Clan. Rena is an extreme introvert and prefers to communicate by writing in a notebook. She wields twin katana, and , one black and the other white. With these swords, she is able to remove a demon from a possessed human without harming the host. Like Kanna, Rena has obtained a job at a maid café to help out with expenses. Her demure nature makes her much more amiable among normal humans, which is the reason why she is extremely popular at the maid cafe. Why she never talks is never revealed, but she can talk even if only in her ultimate mode (she released all her power at once making her look more demonic than human and extremely increasing her power for a short time. Only members of the Royal Family bloodline have the ability to do this.) She is an Assassin type Oni meaning that she excels in speed and while much stronger than a human she's still much weaker than Kanna or Erionelle. As such she causes significantly less damage to the area than Kanna and goes for quick, accurate and targeted strikes rather than smashing through everything like Kanna. :Usually the quiet type, Rena has shown her temper on various occasions, mainly in order to protect Setsuna from demons or from Kanna's attempts to undermine her own bid for his heart. Rena cares deeply for Setsuna and worries for his safety. She constantly writes safety precautions in her notebook and makes sure Setsuna understands them. Thus, even when she battled Kanna over Setsuna's heart she wasn't really trying very hard. Mainly because she's more interested in beating Kanna for once rather than the power she'd receive from the heart. ; :Also known as the from the Royal Oni Clan, Hina is the cousin of Kanna and Rena. Ever since they were young, Kanna and Rena would bully Hina, who withstood everything in hopes that they would be friends. It was Hina's dream to become a Sage. She studied hard for ten years for the chance to take the Sage Test, only to find out it was cancelled because Kanna and Rena had begun the Banriko Heart challenge. Furious, Hina plotted against her cousins. She persuaded Shoko to bring Setsuna to an isolated location. When Setsuna called forth Kanna and Rena, they were all stuck in a trap. Shoko, realizing that Hina meant harm to Setsuna, broke the source of the trap. Ironically, the Brand of Dominion meant for her cousins was placed on Hina, naming Shoko as her master. In order for Hina to survive, she must drink a bit of Shoko's blood every day. As a result, Hina was forced to move in with Shoko and work as a maid. Although she hates being treated like a slave she does appreciate the care Shoko shows for her at times and has kept quiet about Setsuna's impending demise at the end of his contract. She cares about Shoko so much that she went into her Ultimate form when Shoko was critically wounded during a fight. Rather than a Speed or Power type like her cousins, she's a Sage type which specializes in magic and intelligence. :Through the use of her long smoking pipe, Hina is able to summon Smoke Familiars which resemble large stuffed animals. In her Ultimate form they look more like large, savage versions of animals rather than toys. She also enjoys making potions and has a good knowledge of medicine and herbs. Hina originally had a bad opinion of Setsuna; however, after finding out that he lied to Shoko about his circumstances in order to not worry her, she began to realize he was a lot stronger than she gave him credit for. She also comments on how he has such a pure heart that he won't even strike back at the little kids who were bullying him for interfering with their fun with Kanna. ; :Little is known about this new transfer student to Setsuna's class except that she is the princess of Adenbulk, the Western Oni World which are known as Zombie Oni and are constantly battling (and losing to) the Oni Royal Family (which Kanna and Rena are part of.) This is because the Oni Royal Family treats and thinks about the Zombie Oni as dirty, weak and not worth enough to even be considered servants. With soulless eyes and long black hair that goes down to her legs, she has been tasked with the assassination of the two demon princesses under the orders of her father. Unlike the other Oni shown so far, she shows absolutely no desire to obtain the Banrikou Heart and only wishes to eliminate the White and Black Princess. Destroying the Banrikou Heart is only a means to prevent the princesses from receiving more power and the extreme humiliation they'd receive for failing to protect the heart. As a Royal Zombie Oni she is able to use Death Illusion, a spell that forces a target to experience their most feared death over and over until the day they die or the spell is removed by somebody else, with ease where other Oni would be hard pressed to even attempt much less control the spell. While stronger than Rena she is no match for Kanna. She develops a huge crush on Setsuna after he buys her lunch and saves her shortly after they met. As such she protects him from a minion after his heart and performs a special ritual known only to the Zombie Clan on him. Being more direct than Kanna or Rena with her feelings for him she keeps using rather aggressive, blunt and direct methods such as using the others as hostages if he doesn't go to her home and marry her. How her family and court are reacting to this is unknown. In her true form she doesn't take on an Oni's demonic appearance like the other princesses but looks just as she does in her human guise except for her skin turning a pale violet tinged grey and her hair turning silver. Although how is not explained her clothes also change to a dark purple frilled headband, black and grey plate mail boots, black and grey plate mail gauntlets covering her hands to upper arms, and an open dark purple coat over a white frilled dress with a ripped hem. She wields a double-edged, guardless greatsword and is a Power type Oni that excels in strength. While angry with how the Royal Oni Clan looks down on the Zombie Oni she is similar to Kanna in that she doesn't like using dishonorable means but prefers to fight head on at full power.

Brown. While Robeson wrote many articles and speeches, Here I stand is his only book. It has been described as part manifesto, part autobiography. It was published by Othello Associates and dedicated to his wife Eslanda Goode Robeson.Here I stand. (Book, 1958) WorldCat.org Retrieved 2015-12-15. Contents Foreword Robeson acknowledges his roots and dedicates himself to winning freedom for his people in America. He intends the book not to be an autobiography, but to give insight into his thinking. Prologue Robeson recalls his childhood and upbringing. I Take My Stand Robeson traces his development as actor/ singer from America to England which became his home from 1927 to 1939. There, he started to learn more about Africa, its cultures and languages. In 1934 he travelled to the Soviet Union and experienced absence of racism. He opines that communism would be helpful to overcome colonialism. Robeson affirms his belief in socialism, but also asserts that he never joined the communist party. At length Robeson discusses his remarks at the World Peace Conference at Paris in 1948 where he asked Blacks to realize that the fight for a free world begins at home and the reactions to his speech. He fully concurs with the Ten Principles of Bandung. Love Will Find Out the Way While in England Robeson connected to the common man. \\"This belief in the oneness of humankind.. has existed within me side by side with the deep attachment to the cause of my own race\\",Paul Robeson, ibid., page 48f a concept first felt through song. With the rise of fascism in Europe in the thirties, he recognized that the struggle for black liberation was inseparable from the anti-fascist struggle. He further relates how he somehow managed to maintain some international bonds during the years he has been restricted and how the documentary The Song of the Rivers was created. Our Right to Travel Robeson's passport was revoked in 1950 and he argues this was done because he is a spokesperson for Black people and their freedom. He contrasts his position – fighting for freedom - as being American, while the State Department and John Foster Dulles act un-American. The right to travel is an important part of full citizenship. He reminds the reader of Ira Aldridge who could only achieve artistic greatness by travelling abroad, and of W. E. B. Du Bois whose passport had been revoked although his presence at international congresses would have enhanced the standing of the United States. The Time Is Now Robeson, rejecting segregation and gradualism, demands full citizenship for Black people right there and then. He views the people of the newly freed nations in Africa and Asia as natural allies of the Black cause. Realizing that he cannot change individual prejudice, he demands that racist laws limiting Black equality have to go. The Power of Negro Action Robeson indicates that the moral support of the American people would be on the side of the Black people when they claim their \\"lawful rights with... earnestness, dignity, and determination...\\"Paul Robeson, ibid., page 92 The Black people have the power of numbers, of organization, and of spirit to be successful now. Important examples have been set: the Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom in Washington DC on May 17, 1957, and events in Little Rock and Montgomery. Robeson calls for concerted action and effective leadership. Our Children, Our World In the epilogue Robeson is optimistic. Progress has been made, as seen in Little Rock. The appearance of Sputnik sends a message to work for peace. Racism is the enemy. Appendix The 1971 Appendix contains a number of essays, including one by Benjamin C. Robeson about \\"My Brother, Paul,\\" and a statement by the author after having regained his passport. Also, Robeson includes an essay about the significance of the pentatonic scale. He claims to have discovered common links in folk songs though the use of the pentatonic scale and opines that this pattern also extends into Chinese and African languages. The last section contains \\"A Later Statement by the Author\\" from August 1964 that reviews the progress in the struggle for freedom of the Black people, ending with \\"we surely can sing together: \\"Thank God Almighty, we're moving!\\" 1971 Preface In 1971 Lloyd L. Brown added the Preface to the book upon its reprinting. He recalls the difficult position Robeson was placed in when his rights as a citizen were denied although he was never charged with an illegal action. Robeson's book, Brown asserts, is indispensable to understand his viewpoint. The preface describes the initial reception of the book. It was ignored by the mainstream American press and not even mentioned in new book sections, in contrast to the black, left-wing and foreign press. Brown sees him as the \\"Great Forerunner\\" of Black liberation. Comments The title echoes Martin Luther's famous statement in front of worldly authorities. The book is partly biographical, partly a manifesto that is intended to set the record straight. He makes it clear that his primary allegiance is to his \\"own people\\" and that the trade-unions and the black church are the vanguard institutions. He does declare before Congress that he is a \\"scientific socialist\\", a reference to a term made famous by Frederick Engels. The time for black liberation is in the present and calls for unity; it has to be directed by Black leaders, not by outside organizations that have other interests. While the white mainstream press ignored the book, the black press got its message. \\"I Am Not a Communist Says Robeson\\" headlined The Afro- American. The first edition was sold out within six weeks and Robeson reemerged after his enforced banishment into prominence again.

It first ran on 14 February 1732 at the Royal Theatre, Drury Lane. The plot focuses on a man who sells his wife for money, but then sues for damages by adultery when the money is insufficient. The play also covers the stories of other couples and affairs and romantic pursuits. The play criticises vice and society, but also criticised the law allowing a husband to sue for damages when his wife committed adultery. This view of marriage later served as the theme for Fielding's novel Amelia. The play was well-met when it first ran, though there were some imperfections. Later critics found the characters lacking and the plot faulty, and believed that 18th century spectators would agree. They also believed The Modern Husband to be one of the most serious of the plays written by Fielding. Background The Modern Husband first ran on 14 February 1732.Hume 1988 p. 126 Fielding put a lot of effort into crafting The Modern Husband and, as he admits in the prologue, sought to come up with something new. He first drafted the play in September 1730 and sent it to Lady Mary Montagu for her opinion.Hume 1988 p. 121 The play was produced on stage for 13 nights, which only the The Provoked Husband and Zara ran for as long during that time at Drury Lane. Although early 20th century critics believed that the play could not be popular, it did make money and even put on a benefit show on 2 March 1732. The play was not revived later, possibly because the principal actors of the play died soon after and that the plot of the play discouraged new actors from wanting to play the parts.Hume 1988 pp. 124–126 Cast The original text included the following cast:Hume 1988 p. 122 * Mr. Modern * Mrs. Modern * Lord Richly * Mr Bellamant * Mrs Bellamant * Captain Bellamant – Son of the Bellamants, played by Theophilus Cibber * Emilia Bellamant – Daughter of the Bellamants * Mr Gaywit – Lord Richly's nephew Plot To make money, Mr Modern decides to trade his wife for money from Captain Bellamant. The money was not enough to satisfy Mr Modern, so he sues Lord Richly for damages by adultery. A witness is found to reveal that Mr Modern originally sold his wife to Lord Richly, which undermines his case and he is unable to gain the extra money. During this time, another couple, the Bellamants, are paralleled to the Moderns. Mr Bellamant is involved in an affair with Mrs Modern until Mr Modern catches them. Mrs Bellamant forgives Mr Bellamant for his actions. Other characters through the play are involved with their own romantic pursuits, including the Bellamants' son, Captain Bellamant, who pursues and marries Lady Charlotte Gaywit, and their daughter, Emilia, who marries Mr Gaywit, another of Mrs Modern's lovers.Hume 1988 pp. 122–123 Themes As the epigraph to the print edition from Juvenal reinforces, the play criticises vice and society. In particular, Fielding criticises a law that allowed a husband to sue for damages when his wife commits adultery. Such incidents occurred regularly during the 18th century, and even Theophilus Cibber, who played Captain Bellamant, sued William Sloper through the very law. However, Cibber followed the role of Mr. Modern in his actions. Fielding's view of marriage in The Modern Husband was a theme later picked up in his novel Amelia.Hume 1988 pp. 121–123 Critical response The Daily Post on 3 March 1732 described a benefit run of the play: \\"Last Night their Majesties, his Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, their Highnesses the Princesses, and the whole Royal Family, were to see the new Comedy, call'd the Modern Husband, acted to a splendid Crowded Audience, for the Benefit of Mrs. Porter. This play has been performed thirteen Nights with Applause, to very good Audiences, but is now discontinued, on account of the Indisposition of a principal Actress.\\"Hume 1988 qtd p. 125 Not every response was as kind, and the Grub-street Journal on 30 March 1732 criticises the play, the plot, and attacks the character of Lady Charlotte as unrealistic. However, Fielding alludes that Lady Mary Montagu believed that the character of Lady Charlotte was true to life. Furthermore, even the 30 March 1732 Grub-street Journal stated that the play was viewed favourably by audiences, and 29 June 1731 piece in the journal says that the play was met with encouragement. In June 1732, Thomas Cooke, in his play The Comedian, supported his friend against the critique on 30 March saying that there is great wit and comedy within the play even if there were some imperfections caused by hastily writing the play.Hume 1988 pp. 124–127 Later critics, Wilbur Cross and F. H. Dudden, believe that the characters were lacking and the plot was faulty. It is uncertain as to if 18th century spectators agree, but Cross and Dudden believe that the audiences would have agreed with their assessment,Hume 1988 p. 124 with Cross claiming that the audience hissed during the first night.Cross 1918 p. 120 Likewise, H. K. Banerji believed that the play was \\"a complete failure\\".Banerji 1929 p. 36 Robert Hume characterises the play as a \\"genuine satire (a rarity in English comedy), and it offers one of the darkest comic visions of society since Otway's bitter Friendship in Fashion (1678).\\"Hume 1988 p. 122 However, he later states that \\"the play itself is badly flawed\\".Hume 1988 p. 123 Hume attributes the popularity of the play to Fielding himself, and that the passing of its main actors and the problems with plot discouraged it from being produced again. Like other critics, Hume believes that most critics support the 30 March 1732 criticism of the play that reveals many of the problems within the play. However, the play was dedicated to Walpole and Fielding was working with Colley Cibber, two aspects that encouraged some early criticism of the play by those like the Grub-street Journal.Hume 1988 pp. 126–129 Regardless of the draw backs, Tiffany Potter declared The Modern Husband as \\"Fielding's most serious attempt at social commentary within the five-act comedic form, with situations, characters, and social states resembling those to come in Amelia.\\"Potter 1999 p. 34 NotesReferences * Banerji, H.

It originally appeared with The Covent-Garden Tragedy on 1 June 1732 at the Royal Theatre, Drury Lane and was later revived as The Debauchees; or, The Jesuit Caught. The play tells the story of Catholic priest's attempt to manipulate a man to seduce the man's daughter, ultimately unsuccessfully. Unlike The Covent-Garden Tragedy, The Old Debauchees was well received. The play discussed morality and society's perceptions of morality and was an allusion to a real event like Fielding's other play, Rape upon Rape. Contemporary critics were unclear as to how successful the play was, but modern critics claimed that the play was only effective in the context of its social commentary. Background Both The Old Debauchees and The Covent-Garden Tragedy were written by 4 April 1732 when Fielding signed an agreement with John Watts to publish the plays for a small sum of only 30 guineas.Hume 1988 pp. 129–133 The Old Debauchees, originally titled The Despairing Debauchee, appeared with The Covent-Garden Tragedy on 1 June 1732. The Daily Post reported on 2 June that both were well-received, but retracted that claim on 5 June to say that only The Old Debauchees was well received. The play ran for six nights with one scheduled night cancelled, the 13 June performance. After that night, the play was paired with The Mock Doctor. The play was revived late 1745 as The Debauchees; or, The Jesuit Caught and ran 25 times during the season. This version was published by Watts with the various revisions indicated.Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 400 It was brought back to promote anti-Catholic sentiment during the disputes between the British government and the Stuarts during 1745 and 1746. \\"The Jesuit Caught\\" was added to the play's title to reinforce the anti-Catholic nature of the play.Cleary 1984 pp. 58–59 Cast Cast of the play include:Hume 1988 p. 131 * Old Laroon * Jourdain * Young Laroon * Isabel – Jourdain's daughter, played by Kitty Clive * Father Martin Plot Young Laroon plans to marry Isabel, but Father Martin manipulates Isabel's father, Jourdain, to seduce Isabel. However, other characters, including both of the Laroons, try to manipulate Jourdain for their own ends; they accomplish it through disguising themselves as priests and using his guilt to convince him of what they say. As Father Martin pursues Isabel, she is clever enough to realise what is happening and plans her own trap. After catching him and exposing his lust, Father Martin is set to be punished.Hume 1988 pp. 131–132 Themes Like Rape upon Rape, the title The Old Debauchees is an allusion to a real individual and his corrupt actions.Fielding 2004 p. 414 The basis of the play is connected to an October 1731 trial of Father Girard. Part of the plot incorporates Fielding's own anti-Catholic bias, but he does so in a way that is traditional to English theatre during his time. However, his placement of anti-Catholic rhetoric in Old Laroon's speeches undermines the comedic nature of the words and caused the sentiment to fall flat among audiences.Hume 1988 pp. 130–132 Also, Fielding relies on the play to talk about morality and how society views morality. He discusses doubt and faith along with politics when he takes on most aspects of society. It is possible that there are connections within the play's commentary to George II's mistresses or Robert Walpole's relationship with Maria Skerritt and his wife's relationship with Lord Hervey. Tiffany Potter sees the commentary as representing that \\"it is equally the voice of a libertine mocking those who thoughtlessly accept the constraints of social decorum, gender roles, and sexual repression. This understanding of the play, combined with Fielding's own unorthodox behavior and frequent questioning of social doctrines at this time in his life, marks him to some degree as an advocate of the libertine tradition.\\"Potter 1999 pp. 43–44 Sources The obvious source of the play is the Father Girard's trial for seducing Marie Catharine Cadier. This was a popular subject and other plays, including Father Girard the Sorcerer and The Wanton Jesuit, portrayed the events for which Girard was put on trial.Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 134 He was a Jesuit tried for using magic on Catherine Cadiere. Fielding differs from other accounts by reducing Cadiere as a victim and instead makes her intelligent enough to see through Girard's plot.Hume 1988 pp. 130–131 Critical response The Daily Post wrote on 5 June 1732: \\"We are assured the Comedy call'd The Old Debauchees, did meet with universal Applause; but the Covent Garden Tragedy will be Acted no more, both the Author and the Actors being unwilling to continue any Piece contrary to the Opinion of the Town.\\"Hume 1988 qtd pp. 129–130 The Grub-Street Journal reprinted this on 8 June and proceeded to criticise The Covent-Garden Tragedy.Hume 1988 p. 130 On 16 June the Daily Post wrote again that the play was successful but the 29 June Grub-Street Journal countered that the play fell apart by the third night.Hume 1988 p. 132 However, the 13 July 1732 Grub-Street Journal stated that the play was a success and credited Theophilus Cibber's portrayal of Father Martin. However, the writer did complain that Fielding's critique was not limited to just Catholics.Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 134–135 According to Robert Hume, \\"The Old Debauchees is an unusual combination of farcical buffoonery and harsh invective, and not an effective one.\\"Hume 1988 p. 133 Likewise, Potter points out that \\"The Old Debauchees has been critically dismissed since its initial appearance. Nonetheless, the drama is successful as a piece of social commentary that is both entertaining and enlightening.\\"Potter 1999 p. 43 The Battesins character the play as a \\"tasteless attempt to capitalize on the sensational case of Father Girard\\" but that \\"Fielding was merely doing for his own theatre what others had already done\\". Harold Pagliaro points out that \\"For all its vitality, especially in its celebration of sexuality, in and out of marriage, and its farcical management of Father Martin, The Old Debauchees includes a dark element which its comic force controls only fleetingly.\\"Pagliaro 1998 p. 87 NotesReferences * Battestin, Martin, and Battestin, Ruthe.

Early life Elizabeth Avery was born in Bolivar, Tennessee, on January 19, 1824. She had two siblings: Nathan Avery and Rebecca Rivers Avery. Her parents moved to Memphis when she was nine years old. She attended school there in a little one-story building, where the principal was teacher and janitor, until twelve years old. After that age her information and knowledge was gained from books and papers, with her father's assistance. With a practical mind and excellent memory she stored up a splendid basis for her future line of literary and lecture work. Meriwether's father was a physician — Nathan Avery, of New York; her mother, Rebecca Rivers, belonged to one of the old families of Virginia. Her father's ancestors came over with Penn — the founder of Pennsylvania — and were Quakers. After going South he joined the Methodist Church, to which Meriwether belonged. She amusingly related that her own father said grace three times a day before meals, but her Grandfather Rivers said he didn't believe the Lord wanted to be bothered with hearing the same thing so often, so no one was surprised when one day he called the family out to the smokehouse, where the winter's stock of hams and bacon had been cured, and provisions stored for the year, asking them to join him in saying grace over everything at once for the whole year. Meriwether's parents died when she was a young girl, and she, with two sisters, made their home with their brother, William Thomas Avery, remaining in the old home in Memphis until they married. The two sisters were Amanda Trezevant, four years younger, and Estelle Lamb, six years younger than Meriwether. Career She was the author of many books, giving descriptions of historical incidents of importance in the South during and after the war. For over sixty years she was a steady contributor to the leading newspapers and periodicals of this country. Her \\"Travel Letters\\" caused much favorable comment and interest, and discussions and arguments on political, literary, sociological and every other vital topic of the times, through the columns of the papers, have given her a well-deserved international reputation. As a lecturer she was the first woman to speak from the platform in the State of Tennessee. With Susan B. Anthony, Elizabeth Cady Stanton and other women in the pioneer field, advocating equal rights for women, she lectured all through New England, Texas and other States. The comments made by the press all over the country about Meriwether as a speaker were always in highest terms — \\"her natural oratory, keen sarcasm, sparkling wit, earnest and interesting style, glowing eloquence, etc.,\\" were some of the terms used to express her manner of delivery and the enthusiasm she awakened. The title of one of the books of which she was the author is \\"Facts and Falsehoods Concerning the War of the South of 1861 and 1865,\\" under a pen name — George Edmonds — which was published in 1904. This Meriwether considered the most valuable book. She said: \\"If you read this book you will know more about Lincoln than you ever dreamed of.\\" In 1877 Meriwether wrote a little book entitled \\"Ku-KIux Klan; or, the Carpet-bagger in New Orleans.\\" An Englishman, then in Memphis, sent a copy of this book to London to the editor of the \\"Kensington News,\\" who gave it a very complimentary notice, telling her that if she would write a novel and put as much humor and pathos in it as she had put in the little book, \\"Ku-Klux Klan,\\" he would introduce her to an English publisher who would put it out. She soon had a novel titled \\"The Master of Red Leaf\\" ready, and sent it off to London, where the publishers issued a splendid set of three volumes, gilt-edge, etc. An American firm got out a cheaper edition in one volume, paper-bound. This book was sold in Memphis at the rate of 100 copies a week. \\"The Sowing of the Swords,\\" in 1910; \\"My First and Last Love,\\" and \\"Black and White,\\" 1883, are some of her other stories. Meriwether wrote continuously, and in the end she was busy on her \\"Recollections of a Long Life.\\" In post-war Memphis, she became involved with the suffrage movement and the Women's Christian Temperance Union specifically. Despite it being illegal, she both registered and voted in the 1872 presidential election. Parsons, Elaine Frantz. Manhood Lost: Fallen Drunkards and Redeeming Women in the Nineteenth-Century United States, Baltimore: JHU Press, 2010. She presented (unsuccessful) suffrage petitions at both the Democratic and Republican national conventions in 1880. In 1881 Meriwether began her lecture tour with Susan B. Anthony through the New England States where conventions were being held. Anthony wanted her to speak at these places because she was a Southern woman. As illustrative of her methods of lecturing she carried with her two cartoons, four feet by four feet, which she sketched and painted herself. The men who hated and scorned equal rights declared that no one but an ugly old maid would want to vote, one who could not secure a husband, and should a married woman advocate equal rights she must necessarily be a coarse, rough termagant, who had a feeble- minded, no-account husband. She entered the hall with these cartoons rolled up, and beginning to speak unrolled the old maid's picture, and said, \\"This is the picture of the woman who failed to get a husband — now in this room is one of our women who has failed to get a husband (pointing to a handsome girl of nineteen), she wants to vote, and this is her picture.\\" The comparison, of course, brought shouts of laughter. Then, unrolling the second cartoon, she explained that it was one of herself, the cartoon represented a rough, coarse woman holding a little scared man under her arm, with his legs dangling, which she said was her husband, although the artist didn't get a good likeness of him, as he was six feet tall. At the time Mrs. Meriwether made those addresses she was a slender, vivacious, attractive young woman, and after comparing her with the cartoon which she said was of herself there was a general roar of laughter, clapping of hands, etc. After putting the audience in a good humor she would deliver the lecture which she had in store for them. The same cartoons are hanging on the wall of her living room now and furnish the material for many interesting anecdotes which she relates with much satisfaction. The first time Meriwether lectured in Missouri on \\"equal rights\\" she received many anonymous letters; in some she was denounced as being everything but a good wife and mother. When she made her first public speech in Tennessee she went to the editor of the paper and wanted him to make the announcement, but he said: \\"You will have to get the permission of your husband,\\" which, of course, was readily granted; however, Mr. Meriwether expressed his fear that she might become stage-struck, and her son — Lee — a little fellow ten years old, who was lying on the floor, interrupted, \\"Don't you believe it — mother will go through; she won't get stage struck.\\" The editor, still hoping to discourage her, said people would talk about her. She answered: \\"They can't say I am not a good wife and mother, or that I get drunk.\\" On the night of the lecture, the hall was crowded to overflowing; she made a very successful address. Her brother, being so afraid she would fail, did not have the courage to attend. Returning to Memphis after her lecture tour, Meriwether became the editor of a newspaper, \\"The Tablet.\\" Horace Greeley came to Memphis, making a speech on \\"Self-Made Men,\\" about that time. Meriwetiier wrote an article which she published in her paper about it — a criticism — a humorous one. She sent a copy of the paper to Horace Greeley, who was the editor of the \\"New York Tribune,\\" wanting to exchange with him. But he said his exchange list was so long he could not do so, making the suggestion that if she would advertise his paper in \\"The Tablet\\" he would send it to her for a year. She replied that if he would print the criticism she had written of him in his paper, she would do so, and send him \\"The Tablet\\" for a year. He agreed, and the \\"Tribune\\" was sent her for many years. Personal life In 1852, she married Minor Meriwether of Kentucky, who became a Confederate Major in Oct. 1861, serving as an Engineer constructing defenses and railroads. During her husband's absence, Elizabeth had to flee with her children from Memphis due to conflict with the Federal forces. She later argued with Union General Hurburt in an effort to regain family property confiscated by the US. Minor Meriwether never served under Nathan Bedford Forrest during the war, but they knew each other as former Confederate officers and railroadmen. One of the organizational meetings of the Ku Klux Klan took place in her kitchen in the Meriwether's Memphis home, which stood on the site of what is now the Peabody Hotel. In 1910, Elizabeth Meriwether lived in St. Louis with her son, Lee Meriwether, where she sat for this sketch by journalist Marguerite Martyn. After the war they went back to Memphis, residing there until the yellow fever broke out. Then, going to St. Louis, built the house in which Minor Meriwether died in 1910, and in which Meriwether, with her son, Lee, and his wife, lived till the end. Lee Meriwether, like his father, was an attorney-at-law. He was well known as the author of six books — \\"A Tramp Trip — How to See Europe on Fifty Cents a Day,\\" published in 1887. This book was regarded as an authority on the subject. Then followed, \\"The Tramp at Home,\\" 1890; \\"Afloat and Ashore on the Mediterranean,\\" 1892; \\"Miss Chunk,\\" 1899; \\"A Lord's Courtship,\\" 1900, and \\"Seeing Europe by Automobile,\\" 1911, which was written just twenty-five years after the first book. Lee Meriwether's wife was Jessie M. Gair, of Missouri.

Worldwide, there are about 1500 species.  Anatomy  The apparently tumbling movements are composed of a series of very rapid separate jumps (each jump of a duration of approximately 80 ms). They result from the beetle's efforts to get itself back into take-off position for flight when it has been in either lateral or dorsal position. Each individual jump should be considered as an extended rotation, performed by one leg of the third leg pair (metapodium). Depending on whether the left or the right metapodium is used as the leg that provides the leverage for take-off, change occurs in the direction of the jump. The energy for propulsion varies with the beetle's immediate muscle work, so that jump lengths and heights vary, with rotation frequencies recorded up to 48 per second (Mordellochroa abdominalis) around the gravitation centre of the body's longitudinal axis. Additional revolving around the transverse axis (at lower frequency) effects spiralling somersaults that are perceived as tumbling. The pintail (pygidium) is of no significance for the jump. While the pintail is no significance for the jump, meta-trochanter-femur (thighs and surrounding rings of the third leg pair)has a great capacity of free rotation (up to 270 degrees, at one level only). This capacity is due to a screw joint that connects the base of metacoxa to the head of trochanter. The nut gradient is 21 degrees (as seen under a scanning electron microscopy SEM, 1985). Technically similar jumps, though less powerful, can be observed in family Melandryidae (=Serropalpidae) (genus Orchesia) and family Scraptiidae (genus Anaspis). Their coxa-trochanter-joints are of similar structure. It can be assumed that the capacity of a tumbling form of locomotion is rooted in a common phylogeny and can therefore not be ascribed specifically to Mordellidae. Meanwhile, other authors have also pointed out the speciality of the real screw joint in nature. (2011) The weevil of the genus Trigonopterus, Curculionidae in the Asian tropical rainforest, for example, has an even tighter connective construction in the Coxa -Trochanter joint than is found in Mordellidae. This construction, however, does not facilitate an equally high angular velocity of the torque. The joint here serves to provide a better grip on plants and easier climbing.

Ace was born in the same hospital (Dameron Hospital) around the same time as singer Chris Isaak. Both would attend A.A.Stagg Highschool while living in North Stockton California. Chris was Ace's Highschool President. In the summer of 1968, Ace Andres was introduced to politics. His neighbor was California congressman and House Majority Whip John J. McFall (D)CA. Ace worked in the congressman's re- election headquarters. In 1972 Ace became a volunteer team leader for the \\"George McGovern for President\\" campaign. Ace followed his brother's footsteps and enlisted in the Navy a year later towards the end of the Vietnam War. It was in the US Navy that Ace founded his first professional band, a power trio called Sky High (Kerry Henry/bass and Toby Woodard/drums) that performed in Japan in 1976. After leaving the Navy with an honorable discharge in 1977, Ace returned to the San Francisco Bay Area and recorded his first single \\"Still Waiting\\" and \\"I can't love you no more\\". In the late 1970s Ace met then presidential candidate and former actor Ronald Reagan. This had an effect on the musician that planted the seeds of conservatism in him. In 1980 he registered as a republican. In 1995 Ace publicly confronted incumbent congressman William P. Baker (R)CA in a debate over \\"affirmative action legislation\\". Ace exposed congressman Baker's liberal viewpoint on affirmative action in a town hall meeting in Castro Valley, California which might have contributed to his defeat by the moderate \\"Ellen Tauscher (D)CA. The next day Ace was interviewed on the \\"Savage Nation\\" by best-selling author Michael Savage on the radio station KSFO. In 2002 Ace recorded his first album, Cowboy Hat Blues which received warm reviews. Former female singer Jill Gibson recorded on the cover version of \\"California Dreamin'\\". Gibson was a member of the super group The Mamas and the Papas, the original group that recorded the song.

Kaffenetti was preceded by Tubes drummer Doug Friedman. Tom Bowers of Johnny and the Doorslammers has been Ace's long-time bassist. In 2005 Ace would expose his political bias in the album American Infidel. The song \\"Talk Radio\\" would be used by conservative talk show hosts across the country as \\"bumper\\" music. In addition, the song \\"Save Me\\" (also bumper music) would reflect the pain the country went through at the time of Terri Schiavo's death. In 2007 Andres released the \\"Save Me\\" video that would share his pro-life POV. The video would be used by pro-life groups such as Abortion Clinic 911 and also by the Terri Schindler Schiavo Foundation.Terri Schindler Schivo Foundation In October 2008, Ace, in an interview with Lou Dobbs, was asked about the chance of Obama winning the election, Ace replied; \\"after 8 years of George Bush, any sock monkey with a jackass lapel pin should be able to win\\".

Pilkhana is not officially named in any record of Dhaka City Corporation, but this is the popular name of this place as elephants are a part of its history (pil means \\"elephant\\" and khana means \\"home\\"). History During the 16th century AD, in the period of the Mughal Empire, Pilkhana was a jungle place and was used as the grazing area for the royal elephants, its stable housing no less than 300 elephants. Later, during the period of East India Company administration, the company employees used to tame freshly caught untamed elephants. The rich Zamindars also sent their untamed elephants to this place, where company employees were paid to tame the elephants. This place was practically a forest, with River Buriganga beside it. During the Mughal period the royal elephants kept in this place used to go for grazing in the nearby jungle to the east, which was later turned into Dhaka Nawab's Garden, now known as Paribagh and Shahbagh. The path between Pilkhana and the jungle, through which the elephants traversed, later became public road named Elephant Road.Dhaka-Sriti Bisritir Nagari, Muntasir Mamun. After the fall of Mughal Empire the place Pilkhana was continued to be such used and the then British Empire took over the place for their military activity. In the year 1876 AD Viceroy of India founded \\"Frontier Force\\" and established its headquarters in Pilkhana. This Frontier Force changed its name as Assam Bengal Rifles in the year 1920 AD. After the achievement of Pakistan the name of this para-military force was changed to East Pakistan Rifles, (EPR),thereafter during the Independence War of 1971 the name of EPR was changed to East Pakistan Civil Armed Force, EPCAF. After the Independence of Bangladesh it was changed to Bangladesh Rifles (BDR), and after the BDR carnage on 25 February 2009, it has been changed currently as Border Guard Bangladesh, BGB. Although with the passage of time the name of the said para- military force was changed on number of occasion, but the headquarters of it remain in Pilkhana. = 1971-present = 1971, 25 March: At midnight, the Pakistan Army attacked the EPR headquarters at Pilkhana. 2009, 25–28 February: The 2009 Bangladesh Rifles revolt took place. Members of the Bangladesh Rifles mutinied against senior officials of BDR who were mostly from Bangladesh Army. While the exact reasons for such a widespread mutiny largely remains unknown, words have been on the air regarding possible involvement of vested political quarters inside Bangladesh and even of forces outside Bangladesh. On that fateful day of 25 February 2015 at 9 AM Bangladesh Rifles jawans entered the \\"Darbar Hall\\" auditorium killing BDR Director General Major General Shakil Ahmed. Over the next three days, the BDR jawans killed as many as 64 officers and their family members including women and children. The conflict left as many as 57 people dead and 6 missing. Geography The Elephant Road now can be traced starting at BGB Gate number 3, running through the middle of New Super Market, adjacent to Dhaka New Market, touching the Gauchia Market to reach Bata signal point, and ending at Paribagh. This road is now known as Old Elephant Road.

Tinted Windows was formed in New York City and consists of guitarist James Iha, previously of The Smashing Pumpkins and A Perfect Circle, singer Taylor Hanson of Hanson, bassist Adam Schlesinger of Fountains of Wayne and Ivy, and Cheap Trick's Bun E. Carlos. The album was recorded at Stratosphere Sound Studios in New York, which Schlesinger and Iha co-own with Ivy's Andy Chase. The band signed to S-Curve Records and the album was released on April 21, 2009. An appearance of the band on Late Show with David Letterman occurred on the eve of the release. The album debuted at number 59 on the Billboard 200. Critical reception Tinted Windows received generally mixed reviews from music critics who found the artists' combined musicianship lacking in vision and finesse throughout the project. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 57, based on 9 reviews. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the band members' combined musicianship for complementing each other and being reminiscent of 60s-70s pop-rock, singling out Taylor Hanson's vocal work as being a highlight, concluding that \\"Of all the guys here, he is the only one to never have performed in a guitar-heavy rock & roll band, and his thrill to be singing these sweet melodies over these big, fuzzy guitars can be infectious.\\" Chris Willman of Entertainment Weekly also commended the band's musicianship for being equal and having cohesion throughout the album, concluding that \\"It’s all hook-riddled, fast, and ephemeral, and if you don’t love it, your tie’s too wide.\\" Noel Murray of The A.V. Club said that despite Hanson's voice lacking grit and the material being transparent, he praised the rest of the band for crafting strong production and hook-filled lyrics, concluding that \\"Whatever the intended (or actual) audience, songs as catchy and spirited as “Messing With My Head” and “Without Love” are timelessly fun.\\" Mikael Wood, writing for Spin, said that \\"these bouncy, hook-crammed power-pop jams are safe and catchy enough for Jo Bros fans and Stacy’s mom alike.\\" Stephen M. Deusner of Pitchfork said that the album falters after the first half when the tempo diminishes and found the band's musical contributions middling and uninspired, saying that \\"Ultimately, the whole of Tinted Windows is so much less than the sum of its considerable parts that it's almost tragic. In playing to pop's imagined past, this quartet neglect the idiosyncrasies that made them such compelling individual artists: the inventiveness of Iha's solo work, the humor and specificity of Fountains, the exuberance of \\"MMMBop\\", the sweet escapism of Cheap Trick in the 70s.\\" Evan Sawdey of PopMatters found the supergroup project disappointing, criticizing Schlesinger's nondescript production and composition work and Hanson's vocal delivery coming off as uninterested and lacklustre, saying that \\"Not only is Tinted Windows a terrible, hookless affair, it may very well be the worst album to be released in 2009 thus far.\\" Kevin Liedel of Slant Magazine heavily criticized the album for lacking in artistic quality and distinguishable taste from a stellar group of musicians, concluding that \\"One would think the presence of such savvy and grizzled rock veterans would have been enough to avoid such a limp-fisted disaster. Instead, listeners are subjected to nothing more than a glorified boy band trying desperately to recapture a second wind.\\" Track listing All songs written by Adam Schlesinger except as noted.

Since 1999 it had been run by the Barts Health NHS Trust. It closed on 17 April 2015 as part of the creation of the Barts Heart Centre at St Bartholomew's Hospital, by consolidation of services from the London Chest Hospital and The Heart Hospital, part of University College London Hospital. History The London Chest Hospital was founded on 13 March 1848 by a group of men, predominantly Quakers, who included bankers, merchants and the physician, Thomas Bevill Peacock. They wished to build a hospital to deal with diseases of the heart and lungs, particularly tuberculosis. By June the group, with the patronage of Prince Albert, had raised enough money to open a public dispensary at 6 Liverpool Street, while the hospital was being built. In 1849 a site in Bonner's Fields, part of Victoria Park was purchased and in 1851 Prince Albert laid the foundation stone. The Hospital opened in 1855 at a cost of around £30,000. Until 1923, it was known as the City of London Hospital for Diseases of the Chest, then it was renamed the City of London Hospital for Diseases of the Heart and Lungs, although it was popularly known as the 'Victoria Park Hospital'. A Pathological Laboratory & Research Institute was opened in 1927 funded by the Prudential Assurance Company. In 1937 a new Surgical Wing was added to the Hospital and the name was changed to the London Chest Hospital. The Hospital was badly damaged by bombing during the Second World War and in 1948 it became part of the National Health Service. In 1994 it became part of the Royal Hospitals NHS Trust together with the Royal London Hospital and St Bartholomew's Hospital. On 17 April 2015 it closed due to a reconfiguration of specialist cardiovascular services in north and east London. This enabled the creation of the Barts Heart Centre, one of Europe's largest cardiac centres. Local campaigners opposed the closure which was approved by NHS England in October 2014. Barts Health announced in April 2015 that 'the hospital is no longer up to the demands of rigorous specialised 21st century medicine and is now closed.' Services moved from the London Chest Hospital (Barts Health) and The Heart Hospital (UCLH) to the Barts Heart Centre at St Bartholomew's Hospital in April and May 2015. On 28 August 2015, Barts Health NHS Trust sold the premises to Circle Housing with the proceeds reinvested into the Barts Heart Centre.  Famous patients  Fabrice Muamba, the Congolese-born footballer who played for England's Bolton Wanderers, was taken to the London Chest Hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest on the pitch on 17 March 2012. He recovered, but was forced to retire from football.

Site description The portal of the caravanserai – which is one of the most ancient places among the Central Asia portals – peshtak with the central lancet arch of the niche in which there is a rectangular doorway. The arch concludes with a П-shaped frame, executed from carved terracotta in the form of eight final stars connected with each other, limited by intertwining tapes. The ring is decorated by Arabic inscriptions. On overhanging walls, under the layers of repair plaster, the remains of ancient ganched plasters with figures of vegetative characters are traced.

The caravanserai occupies – 8277 sq. m.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5308/ History Rabat-i Mâlik holds a special place in the history of Iranian architecture. This is due to its impressive façade treatment of ornamental embedded cylindrical columns on the walls flanking the main entrance portal. The large, brick semi-columns were connected at the top by arches—a rare façade decor found on the flanking walls of the 2500-year-old Apadana palace at Persepolis, and at such Parthian and Sasanian monuments such as Firuzabad. The only other building of the Islamic period that contains such a treatment, is found on the minaret of Jarkurgan/Dzharkurgan in the neighbouring Surkhondaryo province of Uzbekistan. Regrettably, except for the entrance portal that was badly damaged, the earthquake of 1968 totally demolished what was left of the rest of the rabat, including the landmark flanking walls with the semi-column decorations. Luckily, detailed monochrome photographs are available of the old flanking walls to document this landmark building and help with accurate restorations in the future.

Zasławski (plural Zasławscy) was the name of a Polish–Ruthenian noble family and a cadet branch of the Ostrogski family. The Zasławski family had its power base in Volhynia, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland (today in Ukraine), and traced its origins to a branch of the Rurikids that took its name from the Iziaslav. Due to their relation to the Rurikids, the Zasławski family held the title of Knyaz (prince). History The Zasławski family was one of the three major families in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth to trace its origins to the Ruthenian Rurikids; the other two families were the Ostrogski family and the Wiśniowiecki family. The Zasławski family was sometimes seen as a junior line of the Ostrogoski family. After the death in 1620 of the last male heir of the Ostrogoski family, Janusz Ostrogski, many of the Ostrogoski possessions were inherited by the Zasławcy. However, the Zasławski family faced a similar fate when their last male heir, Aleksander Janusz Zasławski, died in 1682. Their huge possessions passed to the Lubomirski family (due to their marriage with Aleksander's sister, Teofilia Ludwika Zasławska) and other families of Polish szlachta.

It was established in 1235/36 by Dayfa Khatun, who would later serve as the Ayyubid regent of Aleppo. It is the largest and best known of the Ayyubid madrasas in Aleppo. Due to its location outside the city walls, the madrasa was developed as a freestanding structure.Firdaws Madrasa Archnet Digital Library. Relationship to environment Built in 1236 by the queen al-Malika Dayfa Khatun,Ruggles, D. Fairchild, ed., Women, Patronage, and Self-Representation in Islamic Societies, SUNY Press, 2000 p.18. the Madrasa al-Firdaws was funded through the queen's personal resources.Rana Jalabi-Holdijk, \\"Al-Madrasa al-Firdaus in Aleppo: a chef-d'oeuvre of Ayyubid architecture\\" (master's thesis, American University in Cairo. Dept. of Arab and Islamic Civilizations, 1988), 39. These funds stemmed from a waqf that she established for the madrasa that consisted of the income of the village of Kafr Zayta and two-thirds of the income from a nearby mill. The complex was intended to serve as an important center for Muslim worship and Islamic learning as evidenced by the functionaries Dayfa appointed to the madrasa: Quran reciters, fuqah’s or jurists, and members of Sufi orders. In the 13th century, Aleppo had become a major center for commerce and religion. During the Ayyubid period, the majority of Aleppines were merchants with a strong inclination towards Shia Islam.Jalabi-Holdijk, \\"Al-Madrasa al-Firdaus,\\" 39. Overcrowding in the city led to the construction of large monuments, including the al-Firdaws Madrasa, outside of the city walls. The site surrounding the madrasa is referred to as the “Maqamat” or “maqam” area. In this case, the term maqam denotes the spiritual power and resonance of an area where a prophet once resided or stayed.Jalabi-Holdijk, \\"Al-Madrasa al-Firdaus,\\" 11. While this was not the only maqamat area dedicated to Abraham in Aleppo, the importance of the madrasa within the maqamat area outside of the city is significant as it dictates why the site became a burial area as well as an area for spiritual retreat. Its label as a maqam location incited a powerful level of spiritual resonance and its location away from the packed city created a more spiritual area than the other maqams.Jalabi-Holdijk, \\"Al- Madrasa al-Firdaus,\\" 11-12. Another important factor relating to the madrasa location is its proximity to the main road leading out of the city and on to Damascus. This road was not only used each year for the Hajj procession, but also lead through the main gate of Aleppo known as the Bab al-Maqam and to the Citadel at the cities center.Jalabi-Holdijk, \\"Al-Madrasa al-Firdaus,\\" 32. The placement of the madrasa at an area with so much traffic would likely have been intentional in order demonstrate the power and wealth of the ruler of Aleppo to any passerby. In addition, the sites strong religious ties would have earned continuous words of prayer from anyone moving by. Visual analysis The Madrasa al- Firdaws was built outside of the city walls of Aleppo so there were few limitations when considering its architectural planning.Tabbaa, Yasser. 1988. Geometry and Memory in the Design of the Madrasat al-Firdows in Aleppo. In Theories and Principles of Design in the Architecture of Islamic Societies. Margaret Bentley Sevcenko (ed). Cambridge, Massachusetts: Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture., 24. The style of the building can be characterized by its visible regularity and rationale when observing its architectural details. This emphasis on regularity is not commonly seen in other examples of Syrian medieval architecture.Ibid,27. It is rectangular in shape and topped by 11 domes.Ibid, 24. At its center is a courtyard which follows the ancient 3-4-5 ratio in which a rectangular area was made by combining two pythagorean triangles.Ibid, 25. The heights of the building's columns shared the same measurement as the distance in between columns.Ibid, 27. Geometric references like these are seen throughout the building's plan to reinforce its regularity. The building is based on a 4 Iwan plan, in which four spaces opened into central courtyard where they met. However, this plan was altered to only include one Iwan on one side of the building.Ibid, 26. The remaining 3 sides are surrounded by domes. On either side of the northern Iwan there is an entrance to a smaller iwan and two, double storied residences were eventually added to house those who would come to the madrasa.Tabbaa, Yasser. 1988. Geometry and Memory in the Design of the Madrasat al-Firdows in Aleppo. In Theories and Principles of Design in the Architecture of Islamic Societies. Margaret Bentley Sevcenko (ed). Cambridge, Massachusetts: Aga Khan Program for Islamic Architecture.,28 According to Sbit ibn al-‘Ajami the northern Iwan would have overlooked an enclosed garden with a pool.Ibid. This view combined with inscriptions wrapping around the building would have evoked ideas of paradise for those who visited.Ibid, 32. There are two lengthy Arabic inscriptions in on the Madrasa al-Firdaws which together span over more than seventy meters. One can be read around the eastern facade while the other surrounded the courtyard.Ibid. The inscription around the eastern facade was taken from the Quranic verses 6:85 and 12:4-6 in which believers were promised a Paradise where they would be “served on plates of gold”.Ibid. The inscription around the courtyard draws upon poetry and mysticism to describe the activities of members of the Sufi order who would have congregated at the madrasa.Ibid. Function Al-Firdaws was founded to house many facilities for religious as well as familial purposes for the queen's family. Among the complex was the mausoleum, the madrasa, the ribat, the khanqa and the zawiya. The mausoleum was created to house the bodies of the queen and her family, as well as several saints later on. The Ayyubid standards for mausoleums called for the structure to be raised, in a clean site and being located near a holy place. This mausoleum upheld Ayyubid standards by being located at a raised and clean site without any dirty water or waste nearby. al-Firdaws also follows the Ayyubid mausoleum rules because it is located near a holy site: the Maqam of Abraham.Jalabi-Holdijk, “Al- Madrasa al-Firdaus,” 40. Because of the mausoleum being located in the al- Firdaws complex, the site is technically a “funerary madrasa” by definition. The madrasa itself was a formal school that maintained a traditional teaching method. Students would live with one man in an apprentice-type learning environment to learn from him. This education would most usually be for gaining religious knowledge and was seen as a good moral action.Jalabi- Holdijk, “Al-Madrasa al-Firdaus,” 43. Also in the complex was the ribat, part of the structure that originally would have been a small fort defended by volunteers. However, this ribat was more of a religious space acting as a hospice and shelter for the poor in Aleppo.Jalabi-Holdijk, “Al-Madrasa al- Firdaus,” 49. The khanqa was a space for the Sufi scholars who would be trained in law instead of the religious teachings from the madrasa. The zawiya served as a more informal school where the teacher would approach each student differently and there were less rules than at the ribat or the khanqa.

The significant difference between Dispute Review Boards and most other Alternate Dispute Review techniques (and possibly the reason why or Dispute Review Boards have had such success in recent years) is that the Dispute Review Board is appointed at the commencement of a project before any disputes arise and, by undertaking regular visits to the site, is actively involved throughout the project (and possibly any agreed period thereafter).\\"Chern on Dispute Boards\\", third edition - Informa Law from Routledge, 2015 (www.routledge.com/books/details/9781138781733/) A Dispute Board becomes a part of the project administration and thereby can influence, during the contract period, the performance of the contracting parties. It has 'real- time' value. The idea behind a standing Dispute Resolution Board is that it may be called upon early in the evolution of any dispute which cannot be resolved by the parties and be asked to publish decisions or recommendations on how the matters in issue should be settled. It is usual (but not compulsory) that an opportunity remains for the matter to be referred to arbitration or to the courts if the Dispute Review Board's decision does not find acceptance by the parties. Thus a Dispute Resolution Board may be likened to the United Kingdom's adjudication process, either under statutory-compliant contracts or under the regime established by statute itself . What a Dispute Review Board does that United Kingdom statutory adjudication does not do is to provide a regular and continuing forum for discussion of difficult or contentious matters, to identify ways forward by acting in an informal capacity and to create valuable opportunities for the parties to avoid disputes by keeping proactive communication alive. Another aspect, which is less often discussed, is that by establishing a Dispute Board from the inception of the project the Dispute Board members become part of the project team and are thought of in a different fashion and because of their \\"hands on\\" approach can be trusted to be fair and impartial and their advise respected and taken more readily than would a third party or stranger to the project. The terms Dispute Board or Dispute Review Board are generic terms and include (a) the Dispute Review Board (DRB) which is a device that originated in the USA and provides non-binding recommendations); (b) the Dispute Adjudication Board (DAB) which is a device emerging from the earlier USA model, but which provides a decision that has interim-binding force); and (c) the Combined Dispute Board (CDB), which is a hybrid of Dispute Review Boards and Dispute Adjudication Boards which was created by the International Chamber of Commerce in 2004. Various other terms have been used such as Dispute Settlement Panel, Dispute Mediation Board, Dispute Avoidance Panel and Dispute Conciliation Panel. Fundamentally these different varieties of Dispute Review devices are the same, each providing early adjudication based on the contractual bargain between the parties. A Dispute Review Board is a creature of contract; the parties establish and empower a Dispute Review Board with jurisdiction to hear and advise on the resolution of disputes. Within the United Kingdom it is entirely possible for the contracting parties to establish a Dispute Review Board to adjudicate construction contract disputes within the statutory requirement for adjudication . As yet, there are no statutory requirements for Dispute Review Boards to be established to adjudicate disputes under construction contracts. While the origins of Dispute Review Boards are found in the construction industry, their ambit is far wider than construction and Dispute Review Boards are now found in the financial services industry, the Maritime Industry, long-term concession projects, operational and maintenance contracts. The scope for Dispute Review Boards is substantial. The emergence of the International Chamber of Commerce as an active supporter of Dispute Boards, as well as the Dispute Board Federation and the Dispute Resolution Board Foundation, makes it highly probable that dispute boards will be established in a range of industries that, until now, have not used adjudication to any great extent. The Costs Savings Recent studies have shownThe Dispute Board Federation (Geneva) 2008 International Survey www.dbfederation.org that the cost of a Dispute Board will result in even the most strenuous dispute being resolved and with an almost 99% success rate of dispute resolution without the need for either costly litigation or arbitration the savings are enormous. The reason this is significant is because the construction industry has a reputation for disputes and conflict. Anecdotal evidence from Australia, as just one example, indicates that 50% of all legal cost associated with construction is expended in connection with disputes. In almost 10% of projects, between 8% and 10% of the total project cost was legal cost. Not surprisingly, these projects have a high incidence of disputes. This expenditure, which globally represents an enormous sum each year, does not begin to take into account the hidden costs of disputes; the damage to reputations and commercial relationships, the cost of time spent by executive personnel, and the cost of lost opportunities. The situation is aggravated by the increased use of joint ventures both in consulting and in contracting. Such organisations are less autonomous and perhaps less able to negotiate settlements of their contractual problems.

The home ground of Chorley F.C., it opened in 1920. History Victory Park Chorley originally played at Dole Lane (now the Coronation recreation ground), but moved to Rangletts recreation ground in September 1901. Victory Park was built adjacent to the recreation ground in 1919 and was opened in 1920. It was named Victory Park to commemorate the end of the First World War. The original grandstand was gutted by fire on 17 November 1945, just hours after an FA Cup tie against Accrington Stanley, with a new stand being built in May 1947 at a cost of £5,500. Chorley's record attendance for a game at Victory Park is 9,679 for a FA Cup tie against Darwen on 15 November 1932. Rugby league Springfield Borough moved to Victory Park in 1988 and became Chorley Borough RLFC. They played there for one season before moving to Moss Lane, Altrincham and adopting the name Trafford Borough RLFC for the 1989–90 season. This caused a boardroom split leading to the creation of a new Chorley Borough rugby league club based at Victory Park. Chorley's first game was against Trafford Borough in the Lancashire Cup in front of 628 spectators. The record attendance at Victory Park was 2,851 for the visit of Oldham in January 1990. The club went through a variety of names 'Chorley Chieftains', 'Chorley Magpies', 'Central Lancashire' (non playing period), 'Lancashire Lynx', and finally 'Chorley Lynx'. In 2004 Chorley Lynx folded due to poor attendances and the withdrawal of funding by backer Trevor Hemmings. 1883 Stand In the 2017-18 Vanarama National League North season, Chorley started work on the '1883 Stand' that would add an extra 75 seats to Victory Park for sponsors and 1883 Lounge use only.

The engines were retired in 1865 and 1868.  Technical features  The boiler was rivetted from several sections. The outer firebox was equipped with a semi-circular dome that extended forward over the boiler barrel and acted as a steam collection space. The two spring balance safety valves were located on the dome of the outer firebox. The steam cylinders were located externally, unlike those on English locomotives, which avoided the need for a cranked axle that would have been expensive and difficult to manufacture. The steam engine was equipped with inside Stephenson valve gear. The locomotives did not have their own braking equipment. Braking could only be achieved using the hand-operated screw brake on the tender. The locomotives had Kirchweger condensers to pre-heat the feedwater. An external feature of that is the second chimney on the tender. Exhaust steam was led from the valve chest to the tender through a low-down, 100 mm, connecting pipe.

The campaign was part of a larger conflict which became known as the War of Jenkins' Ear. Local British forces under the command of the Governor James Oglethorpe rallied and defeated the Spaniards at the Battle of Bloody Marsh and the Battle of Gully Hole Creek, forcing them to withdraw. Britain's ownership of Georgia was formally recognized by Spain in the subsequent Treaty of Madrid. Background The colony of Georgia had been an issue of contention between Britain and Spain since its foundation in 1733. Spain claimed the territory for its own colony of Florida and disputed what was regarded as an illegal occupation by the British settlers. The Convention of Pardo in 1739 had attempted to settle the dispute, but Spain still refused to abandon its claim. When the War of Jenkins' Ear broke out that same year, Spain began drawing up plans for an invasion. The British governor of Georgia, James Oglethorpe, organized a small force and launched a British invasion of Florida in 1740, hoping to preempt a Spanish invasion of Georgia. The British besieged St. Augustine but were forced to withdraw. The stage was then set for the Spanish commander Manuel de Montiano to launch his long-awaited attack on Georgia. Because of the pressing demands on British resources in other theatres, no further reinforcements or aid could be dispatched to defend the colony from attack. Invasion Castillo de San Marcos – St. Augustine. Stronghold of Manuel de Montiano =Landing= Spanish governor Don Manuel de Montiano commanded the invasion force, which by some estimates totalled between 4,500 and 5,000 men. Of that number, roughly 1,900 to 2,000 were ground assault troops. Oglethorpe's forces, consisting of regulars, militia, and native Indians numbered fewer than 1,000. The garrison at Fort St. Simons resisted the invasion with cannonade, but was not able to prevent the landing. On the 5 July 1742 Montiano landed nearly 1,900 men from 36 ships near Gascoigne Bluff, close to the Frederica River. Faced with a superior force, Oglethorpe decided to withdraw from Fort St. Simons before the Spanish could mount an assault. He ordered the small garrison to spike the guns, and to slight the fort (doing what damage they could), to deny the Spanish full use of the military asset. The Spanish took over the fort the following day, establishing it as their base on the island. Montanio began gathering intelligence about the strength of British opposition. =Battle of Gully Hole Creek= State marker commemorating the Battle of Gully Hole Creek After landing troops and supplies, and consolidating their position at Fort St. Simons, the Spanish began to cautiously reconnoiter beyond their perimeter. They found the road between Fort St. Simons and Fort Frederica, but first assumed the narrow track was just a farm road. On July 18, the Spanish undertook a reconnaissance in force along the road with approximately 115 men under the command of Captain Sebastian Sanchez. One and a half miles from Fort Frederica, Sanchez' column made contact with Oglethorpe's soldiers, under command of Noble Jones. The ensuing skirmish became known as the Battle of Gully Hole Creek. The Spanish were routed, with nearly a third of their soldiers either killed or captured. Oglethorpe's forces advanced up Military Road in the direction of Fort St. Simons, in pursuit of the retreating Spanish. Spanish prisoners revealed that a larger Spanish force was advancing in the opposite direction, along the road from Fort St. Simons to Frederica. Oglethorpe left to gather reinforcements. =Battle of Bloody Marsh= Bloody Marsh in 2008 The British advance party, in pursuit of the defeated Spanish reconnaissance force, engaged in a subsequent skirmish, then fell back in face of advancing Spanish reinforcements. When the British reached a bend in the road, Lieutenants Southerland and Macoy ordered the column to stop. There, the regiments and allied Indians took cover in the dense forest. They watched as the Spanish broke ranks, stacked arms and, taking out their kettles, prepared to cook dinner. The British forces attacked the Spanish off-guard, killing roughly two hundred Spaniards.History of Georgia By Robert Preston Brooks page 77Florida's Past: People and Events That Shaped the State, Volume 1 By Gene M.

Oglethorpe was credited with the victory. =Withdrawal= Montiano regrouped his forces and stood poised for a further advance. Oglethorpe continued to press the Spanish, trying to dislodge them from the island. A few days later, approaching a Spanish settlement on the south side, he learned of a Frenchman who had deserted the British and gone to the Spanish. Worried that the deserter might report the true number of the small British force, Oglethorpe spread out his drummers, to make them sound as if they were accompanying a larger force. He wrote to the deserter, addressing him as if a spy for the British, saying that the man just needed to continue his stories until Britain could send more men. The prisoner who was carrying the letter took it to the Spanish officers, as Oglethorpe had hoped. The timely arrival of British ships reinforced the misconception among the Spanish that British reinforcements were arriving. The Spanish left St. Simons on 25 July, ending their last invasion of colonial Georgia. Aftermath A monument commemorating the Battle of Bloody Marsh In the months after the invasion, Oglethorpe considered launching further counter-attacks against Florida, but circumstances were not favourable. The focus of the war had shifted from the Americas to Europe and arms, supplies and troops were not readily available. The region descended into an uneasy peace, occasionally punctuated by minor skirmishes. The Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle ended the war in 1748 and recognised the status of Georgia as a British colony, formally ratified by Spain in the subsequent Treaty of Madrid.

It is about a love triangle in a brothel involving two prostitutes. While they are portrayed satirically, they are imbued with sympathy as their relationship develops. The play is a mockery of tragedy in general, but the characters contain realistic qualities separating them from other characters within Fielding's plays. This realism conflicts with the comedic nature. The play was a failure and ended its run after its first night, in part because it was set in a brothel. Contemporary critics noted the complete failure of the play and one implied that Fielding was acquainted with brothels. However, modern critics pointed out that the play was very good if not for its setting. Background The Covent-Garden Tragedy appeared with The Old Debauchees on 1 June 1732. It was reported on 2 June by the Daily Post that both were well-received, but they retracted that claim on 5 June to say that only The Old Debauchees was well received. The Covent- Garden Tragedy was immediately ended after its first night because, according to Fielding, of the play's use of a brothel as a setting. Both plays were finished by 4 April 1732 when Fielding signed an agreement with John Watts to publish the plays for a sum of only 30 guineas.Hume 1988 pp. 129–132 It was finally published on 24 June 1732.Hume 1988 p. 135 Even though the first night fell apart, the play was performed again later; it eventually appeared again for four nights with Don Quixote in England and once separately in 1734 at the Little Haymarket. On 21 March 1735, it was performed at the York Building and again at the Little Haymarket on 28 December 1778. Although it was not successful, it was not truly unpopular, and its plot did not scare others away; it was adapted by William Holcroft as The Rival Queens, which was performed in 1794. Also, it succeeded when it was adapted into a puppet show.Hume 1988 pp. 134–135 It was later reproduced by the National Theatre in 1968.Battestin and Battestin 1993. p. 136 Cast * Lovegirlo * Kissinda * Stormanda * Captain Bilkum * Mother Punchbowl * Leathersides Plot The play deals with a love triangle in a brothel between two prostitutes, Kissinda and Stormandra, and Lovegirlo. Although the characters are portrayed satirically, they are imbued with sympathy as their relationship is developed. The plot is complicated when Captain Bilkum pursues Stormanda. Eventually, Bilkum is killed during a duel and Stormandra supposedly commits suicide, although this is later revealed not to be the case.Paulson 2000 pp. 89–91 Themes Part of the plot is related to Ambrose Philips's The Distrest Mother but serves to mock tragedy in general. The characters are all related to prostitution and contain realistic qualities which separate the characters from others within Fielding's plays. Combined with real details, it is hard for the comedic nature of the play to take over. Even the written prolegomenon added to the published version is a biting satire.Hume 1988 pp. 134–136 The character Mother Punchbowl plays with the image of motherhood in general, especially by having her be seen as a mother figure to prostitutes and those who frequent the brothels.Paulson 2000 p. 91 Sources During the play, Fielding emphasises the importance of Hogarth's satire and makes references to them through his plays, especially to A Harlot's Progress. Many of Fielding's characters are modelled after Hogarth's: his Mother Punchbowl, the brothel mistress, is modelled on Mother Needham, and Kissinda and Stormandra are modelled on the Harlot.Paulson 2000 p. 89 One of the characters, Leathersides, was a representation of a writer for The Grub-Street Journal. This allowed Fielding to mock one of his greatest contemporary critics. This was followed by Fielding's writing of \\"A Criticism on the Covent-Garden Tragedy, originally intended for the Grub-Street Journal\\". The piece mocks the bias of The Grub- Street Journal, portrays its critics as having no understanding of theatre, and characterises them as being jealous of Fielding's success.Cleary 1984 pp. 59–60 Critical response The Daily Post wrote on 5 June 1732: \\"We are assured the Comedy call'd The Old Debauchees, did meet with universal Applause; but the Covent Garden Tragedy will be Acted no more, both the Author and the Actors being unwilling to continue any Piece contrary to the Opinion of the Town.\\"Hume 1988 qtd pp. 129–130 The Grub-street Journal reprinted this on 8 June with the addition \\"For unwilling read unable\\" and later declared on 15 June that \\"It would be ridiculous to aim any sort of criticism upon so shameful a Piece\\".Hume 1988 qtd p. 130 The piece continued to insinuate that Fielding had experience with brothels.Cleary 1984 p. 59 This sparked a battle between Fielding and The Grub-Street Journal.Hume 1988 p. 130 George Speaight believed that the play was \\"an amusing but coarse burlesque of the old- fashioned heroic drama\\".Speaight 1955 p. 104 Thomas Clearly characterised the play as \\"A lukewarm burlesque of Ambrose Phillips' Distressed Mother\\".Cleary p. 59 Robert Hume believe that \\"The travesty is genuinely brilliant in both conception and details, and there is much to relish here if one is not automatically disgusted by a play whose characters are a madam, her porter, her whores, and their customers.\\"Hume 1988 p. 134 The Battestins declare that \\"Funny as it was [...] The Covent-Garden Tragedy was too ribald for the tastes of an audience accustomed to the genteel comedies of Cibber, or, nearer the mark, the more refined merriment of Gay's 'Newgate Pastoral'.\\"Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 136 NotesReferences * Battestin, Martin, and Battestin, Ruthe.

It served as a replacement for The Covent-Garden Tragedy and became the companion play to The Old Debauchees. It tells the exploits of a man who pretends to be a doctor at his wife's requests. The play is an adaptation of Molière's Le Médecin malgré lui, though it has an emphasis on theatrics over a faithful translation. It is a pure comedy and, unlike other plays by Fielding, has no serious moral lesson or purpose. The play was far more successful than The Covent-Garden Tragedy. Contemporary critics disagreed over whether the play was inferior to the original, but modern critics believed Fielding's version was equally impressive. Background The Mock Doctor: or The Dumb Lady Cur'd was the replacement for The Covent-Garden Tragedy as the companion play to The Old Debauchees. The play is an Anglicised adaptation of Molière's Le Medecin malgre Lui and is contemporary to the translation by John Watts in the Select Comedies of Molière,Hume 1988 p. 136 even though there is no direct connection between Fielding and the translation. The play was first advertised in the 16 June 1732 Daily Post as being in rehearsal and first ran on 23 June 1732.Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 136–138 It was later revised by 16 November 1732, and both versions were successful. The play ran for a total of twenty-four nights that year and was revived even until the nineteenth century.Hume 1988 pp. 137–138 The revised version was shown on 16 November 1732 as an author's benefit and shown on 30 November at the request of the king. It was published by John Watts\\"Printed for J. Watts at the Printing- office in Wild-Court near Lincoln's Inn Fields\\". on 11 July 1732 with a second edition published on 30 November 1732.Paulson 2000 p. 35 Cast * Gregory * Dorcas * Sir Jasper * Charlotte * Leander Plot The basis of the plot is the story of Gregory's pretending to be a doctor.Paulson 2000 p. 59 Gregory starts off as a simple woodcutter by trade, but his wife forces him to take on the role of doctor. He disguises himself as Dr Ragou, a Frenchman, and goes to treat Sir Jasper's daughter, Charlotte, who pretends to be unable to speak. Charlotte pretends to be mute because she feels that it is the only way for her to avoid marrying who her father wants her to marry. Instead, she wants to marry a man named Leander. While treating Charlotte, Gregory's disguise is able to fool his wife and he begins to pursue her as the Frenchman. However, Dorcas is able to figure it out that it is her husband in the disguise.Pagliaro 1998 pp. 89–90 Themes Unlike Fielding's other plays, there is no serious moral lesson or purpose in The Mock Doctor. Instead, it is a pure comedy and follows closely to Molière's structure with alterations to adjust the format of the play to an English setting. Likewise, the language is Fielding's and emphasis theatrics over a faithful translation.Hume 1988 pp. 137–138 Sources Although Fielding is in debt to Molière, he made the play his own. In terms of characters, the power of the husband figure is shifted to the wife figure, and there is a connection between Gregory and the real life John Misaubin, of whom Fielding dedicates The Mock Doctor.Pagliaro 1998 p. 89 However, the wife and husband also resemble Fielding's previous characters, the Moderns.Paulson p. 59 Fielding added nine songs to Molière's version and changed a few scenes around, including substituting unmarried characters for married characters during a sex scene. The original adaptation filled only one act but the revised version added distinct scene changes. The revised play also replaced four songs.Hume 1988 pp. 137–138 Critical response The 26 June 1732 Daily Post reported that the play was shown to \\"a full House, with great applause\\" and that \\"Le Medecin Malgre Lui, of Molier, from whence the Mock-Doctor is taken, bears the greatest reputation of any petite Piece in the French language; and many good Judges allow the English Farce is no way inferior to the Original.\\"Battestin and Battestin 1993 qtd. p. 137 The Grub- Street Journal disagreed with the reporting and printed on 29 June and 20 July 1772 that Fielding performed a disservice to the original.Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 137 The 24 August 1732 Grub-Street Journal stated that the play was favoured by audiences but gave all credit to Molière and the actors instead of to Fielding. Later, John Hill, a rival to Fielding, admitted in the 13 January 1752 London Daily Advertiser that the play defined the English farce.Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 640 Harold Pagliaro connects The Mock Doctor with The Covent-Garden Opera and says that they are able to make \\"its nominal subject subordinate to a different purpose: writing a funny play about something else.\\"Pagliaro p. 89 Robert Hume believes that \\"Fielding benefited greatly from taking over the well-crafted frame of Molière's play, but what he provided by way of adaptation and additions he handled with great skill.\\"Hume 1988 p. 138 The Battestins argue that the play \\"in time became the standard of its kind, the light farce\\".Battestin p. 137 Ronald Paulson attributes the success of this adaptation to Fielding's later adaptation of Molière's The Miser.Paulson 2000 p. 60 NotesReferences * Battestin, Martin. \\"Dating Fielding's Letters to Lady Mary Wortley Montagu\\" Studies in Bibliography 42 (1989). * Battestin, Martin, and Battestin, Ruthe.

Shaykh Baha-ud-Din or Bohoutdin was the founder of the Naqshbandi order, and was considered the spiritual patron of Bukhara governors; he died in 1389. That is why his necropolis, which was subsequently erected at his tomb, always was and remains the most esteemed in Uzbekistan and its fame has reached other Islamic countries. Ancient toponymy of this settlement is known under the name Kasri Arifon. Site description The architectural complex consists of several non-simultaneous constructions: 1\\\\. The most ancient is the dahma (gravestone) of Shaykh Baha-ud-Din Naqshband, riveted by marble blocks and enclosed above an openwork of marble lattice. The tomb of Shaykh Baha-ud-Din is located on the top platform, with the marble gravestone and stele. A small khauz (basin) is at the north, and riveted by the marble as well. 2\\\\. The site of the complex is Saho-khona, representing quadrangular pavilion of the type of rotunda. It is a construction with four arches, flanked on the corners by minaret-shaped turrets, which are capped by small domes. 3\\\\. At the complex, there is a mosque called Khakim Kushbegi, with the flat trabeation, supported by the two columns and forming six painted plafonds. To the south adjoins ayvan with five columns and the same number of painted plafonds. To the north is another ayvan, also with five wooden columns, beam ceiling and vassa. 4\\\\.

Life Peter Jarweh was born on 9 July 1777 in Aleppo. He was a relative of Patriarch Ignatius Michael III Jarweh, who took care of his education. He was ordained priest on 12 June 1802 and visited Rome in 1805–1806. On 14 September 1810 he was ordained bishop of Jerusalem. In 1818, after a contact with the Protestant missionary W. Jowett, he went to Europe to raise funds: in London the Church Missionary Society gave him 10,000 francs, and in Paris Louis XVIII gave him another 8,000 francs. With this amount he bought a printing press and took it to the Charfet monastery (the patriarchal See) in Lebanon in order to print the Bible and other liturgical texts in Arabic. On 25 February 1820 he was elected Patriarch of the Syriac Catholic Church, but Rome was suspicious because of the gift he had received from the Protestant missionaries, and he was confirmed patriarch only on 21 February 1828 by Pope Leo XII after he'd visited Rome in 1825-26. During his patriarchate the Syriac Catholic Church expanded, particularly in South Lebanon and in the area of Damascus and gained the conversion of some Syriac Orthodox bishops, among them Antony Samheri (bishop of Mardin and future patriarch) and the bishops of Mosul and Homs. In Mosul the Catholic and Orthodox Syriacs shared the same church-buildings but each one had their own priests. In 1830 the Ottoman Empire recognized the Armenian Catholic Church (that legally included also the Syriac Catholic Church) as a millet, a distinctive religious community within the Empire, thus obtaining civic emancipation for Peter Jarweh's Church from the Syriac Orthodox Church. Having no more to fear from harassment, Peter Jarweh moved the patriarchal See from the Charfet monastery in Lebanon to Aleppo to be closer to his flock. In 1836 he introduced the Gregorian calendar. In 1841 he changed the monastic profession in a simple embrace of the evangelical counsels and he reorganized the seminary of Charfet. Death In September 1850 in Aleppo the Muslims attacked the Christians, burning the churches, and Patriarch Peter Jarweh was seriously wounded in the neck. He died on 16 October 1851 (or on 16 November according to other sources). Works Peter Jarweh left three books of homilies, and a biography of Patriarch Michael III Jarweh.

It runs from Robert Emmet Bridge on the Grand Canal to New Street. It is served by several bus routes. It is divided into Clanbrassil Street Upper (south end) and Clanbrassil Street Lower (north end). It is named after The 2nd Earl of Clanbrassil, an Ulster-Scots nobleman. Clanbrassil () was the name of a Gaelic territory in what is now northern County Armagh..

Northern Ireland Place-name Project. p.2 History 19th-century houses on the east side of Lower Clanbrassil St. From earliest times the street formed part of the Slige Chualann, which ran south from the settlement at Áth Cliath. It took its name from Cualu, the district in which Dublin was situated and which lay between the mouths of the Liffey and the Avoca (in County Wicklow). In 1868, a new street was opened to connect Harold's Cross with Lower Clanbrassil Street. The Lord Mayor, the Aldermen and Frederick Stokes, who had purchased the land and led the project, attended the opening. The street was to be called Kingsland Street, but that name was never used and it became Upper Clanbrassil Street. Between 1886 and 1892, 128 houses were built off Clanbrassil St. (on Daniel St. and Harty Place) by the Dublin Artisans Dwelling Company for the industrial and working classes.Clanbrassil Street, Past and Present history, Sean Lynch, Part 2 Lower Clanbrassil St. was known as part of Little Jerusalem because in the first half of the 20th century it was at the heart of the Jewish community in Ireland. The first Jews fleeing conditions in Lithuania (then part of the Russian Empire) arrived in the early 1870s and eventually settled off Lower Clanbrassil St. In the following decades many of them settled along the South Circular Road, both sides of Leonard's Corner, and in the side-streets off it. Development of the new road In 1953 all residents of Clanbrassil St. received a notice from Dublin Corporation that residences on the west side of the street would have to have removed from the frontage of the properties to make way for a new road. This proposal was constantly changed or deferred, so that in the 1960s and 1970s the street fell into ruin. One by one businesses, public houses and retail outlets closed up or were demolished, and that side of the road became a wasteland. By 1980 the road engineers had increased the amount of space needed to , in order to run a 6-lane dual carriageway through the street, past St. Patrick's Cathedral on to Christ Church Cathedral.Clanbrassil Street, Past and Present history, Sean Lynch, Part 1 After protests and demonstrations by locals and sympathisers against the road, and intervention by the Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, work on the road eventually began in 1989. A 4-lane dual carriageway was constructed, flanked by new houses and apartments. The cost of the road was estimated to be £2 million. Among the features destroyed by the road construction was the crossing known locally as the \\"Four Corners of Hell\\" (the junction of Patrick St., Dean St., New St. and Kevin St.), because there was a public house on each corner; and the well-known hostelry The Bunch of Grapes (formerly Fitzpatrick's, constructed in 1739).

This low arousal results in the inability or difficulty to sustain attention on any task of waning stimulation or novelty, as well as explaining compulsive hyperactive behavior. A person with low arousal reacts less to stimuli than one without. This individual, according to Hare (1970) is \\"in a chronic state of 'stimulus-hunger'\\". To further explain, Mawson and Mawson (1977) claim that he or she needs more \\"sensory inputs\\" to feel normal.  Causes  Researchers are unsure what causes low emotional arousal. Researchers have proposed three theories that could account for the low emotional arousal. The first theory stresses that emotional arousal is highly genetic. Secondly, some with low emotional arousal show underarousal of the hypothalamus pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The HPA is responsible for the body's stress response. Because there is thought to be underarousal of the HPA axis, studies have shown that this causes reduced secretion of epinephrine and cortisol. These two hormones are responsible for the physiological response to a threat. Third, low emotion arousal often elicits hypoactivity of the amygdala. The amygdala in the brain is part of the limbic system, and is responsible for processing and regulating emotions. This could possibly explain as to why those suffering from low arousal often lack empathy as well as emotional reactivity to other people.  Antisocial personality disorder  This disorder is characterized by repeated deceitfulness, impulsivity, irritability, and aggressiveness since 15 years old. Persons diagnosed with this disorder often score low on fear conditioning. The lack of the empathy associated with ASPD is thought to be linked to the low arousal theory. A study conducted showed that people diagnosed with ASPD showed less physiological arousal to pictures of people crying than people who were not. ADHD is often a precursor for ASPD. ADHD often co-occurs with conduct disorders 30–50% of the time; this can lead to the development of aggressive behavior which projects a higher likelihood of a person developing ASPD. Noise and performance ADHD is related to an incorrectly functioning dopamine system. In a study, the best performance was exhibited when stimuli caused a certain amount of psychological arousal. When using sound to help brain function, also known as stochastic resonance, it was found that significantly more noise is required to improve the performance of those with ADHD, since they have less dopamine (hypodopaminergia).

A large roll of box-sealing tape in the tape head of a case-sealing machine. Box-sealing tape, parcel tape or packing tape is a pressure-sensitive tape used for closing or sealing corrugated fiberboard boxes. It consists of a pressure-sensitive adhesive coated onto a backing material which is usually a polypropylene or polyester film which is oriented to have strength in both the long (machine) direction and the cross direction. Most often, the tape is 48 mm (approx 2 inches) wide but it is also used in 72 mm (approx 3-inch) widths. A variety of backing strengths and calipers as well as adhesive formulations are available. It is often transparent or tan (beige, buff, brown). Other colors and printing are sometimes available. Uses The tape is most often used as a closure for regular slotted containers (RSCs). A \\"single strip\\" or \\"center seam\\" closure is applied over the center seams of a box extending onto the end panels. The tape can be used as a \\"six-strip\\" closure or \\"H-seal\\" by applying cross strips on the ends of the box. This is used when a relatively weak tape is used or when extra box reinforcement is needed. This method also seals the box to help keep contaminants out. This tape has also been used by artists (E.g.Mark Jenkins) as a way to create molds of objects, as the strength of the tape allows for a strong shell for the mold when completed. Application An automatic box-sealing machine. The tape can be applied manually with a stationary dispenser but is more often applied with a hand-held tape dispenser: this allows the user to more efficiently place the tape on the box, cut it off, and rub it down. Automated machinery for application of tape to high-speed lines is also common. Environmental considerations Based on the solid waste hierarchy, the quantity and size of a tape should be minimized without reducing necessary functionality. Material content of a tape should comply with applicable regulations. Life cycle assessments of the tape and the item being taped are useful to identify and improve possible environmental effects. For example, there may be instances where the use of a PSA tape, compared to an alternative solution, improves the overall environmental impact: or vice versa. If a tape remains on corrugated box during recycling, a tape should be chosen which does not hinder box recyclability.ASTM D1974 For example, when taped corrugated boxes are recycled, film backed box sealing tapes do not hinder box recycling: the PSA adhesive stays with the backing and is easily removed.

The winner of numerous awards, it was produced by the Nebraska Educational TV Network in Lincoln in association with the Great Amwell Company of New York City. Over the three seasons, more than 700 poems by more than 300 poets were presented. The program was built around The First Poetry Quartet consisting of Cynthia Herman, Jill Tanner, George Backman and Paul Hecht. Mr. Hecht's role was later played by Norman Snow and Victor Bevine. To this ensemble were added numerous guest stars including Henry Fonda, Jack Lemmon, Claire Bloom, Vincent Price, William Shatner, Irene Worth, James Whitmore, Fred Gwynne and Jim Dale. Programs were often shot on locations appropriate to the poets or poetic themes being presented. The Shakespeare program was filmed in and around Stratford-on-Avon and Wordsworth and Coleridge in England’s Lake District. Walt Whitman’s Civil War poetry was taped on the battlefield at Gettysburg, and American Indian Poetry was shot in Taos, New Mexico and the Black Hills of South Dakota. Producers and continuity writers for the series were William P. Perry and Jane Iredale. Marshall Jamison was executive producer and director of the majority of the programs with Ron Nicodemus also directing during the first season. Dr. Ron Hull was the executive-in-charge for the Nebraska Network, and Dr. Laurie Zwicky was the literary advisor. Dr. Zwicky also developed a college credit course built around the programs.

He is known as \\"the sparring partner of champions\\". His peak regular USCF rating is 2471, his peak quick rating is 2515 and his peak blitz rating is 2414. Chess Simul NYC (1980) Hoffmann is interviewed in the documentary Bobby Fischer Against the World along with Anthony Saidy, Larry Evans, and Susan Polgar. In 1987 he was profiled in The New York Times. The winner of the New York City junior championship in 1962 and the First Army Championship in 1966, by the age of 21 Hoffmann was ranked number 21 in the nation. His natural tactical flair and strong positional understanding made him a dangerous opponent even to top Grandmasters. Hoffmann went on to have more than a 50-year chess career, winning hundreds of tournaments and playing against most of the top ranked U.S. Grandmasters as well as many World Championship contenders. He was vice president of the Manhattan Chess Club. He is currently a member of the Board of Governors of the Marshall Chess Club in New York City. A colorful figure on the New York City chess scene, Hoffmann was the son of two attorneys, Mercedes Solomon Hoffmann and David Hoffmann and grew up on Park Avenue. He attended Hunter College Elementary School, Horace Mann School and Columbia University. His parents had hopes he would become an attorney but Hoffmann had other plans and after a year at Columbia, dropped out to play chess full-time. The talented young Hoffmann was able to make a modest living playing blitz chess for money in the clubs and parks and was good friends with future World Chess Champion Bobby Fischer, who also enjoyed playing blitz chess for money. The two played countless blitz games together but Hoffmann concedes that only rarely was he able to win a game against Fischer. Hoffmann began teaching chess students at the age of 18 years and has continued teaching students to this day. As of April 2016, Hoffmann was the top ranked senior blitz player in the U.S. He also holds the titles of U.S. Life Master and U.S. Senior Master. In 1981 he was awarded the international chess title of FIDE Master (FM). In 2015, Hoffmann played a blitz match against IM Jay Bonin billed as the \\"Gladiator\\" vs. the \\"Iron Man\\". Iron Man Jay Bonin won 8 - 5. In 2016, a book was published about the match, entitled \\"Ironman vs. Gladiator\\". Hoffmann describes himself as a Games Master, being a master in Chess, as well as Backgammon, Bridge, Scrabble and Poker. Specializing in blitz chess, he has been described by Yasser Seirawan as \\"a near legendary figure in the New York City chess world\\" and a collection of his games entitled The Chess Gladiator (Intl Chess Enterprises, 1996) includes a blitz win against Bobby Fischer. Hoffmann has also authored a book about his signature Czech Benoni chess opening entitled The Czech Benoni in Action (with Greg Keener, Mongoose Press, 2014), and is working on an update of his earlier book The Chess Gladiator as well as a book of his memoirs. Hoffman was portrayed in the movie Searching for Bobby Fischer by actor Austin Pendleton; Hoffman himself declined to participate in the movie, unhappy with the depiction of him as socially inept and possibly autistic. In 1987 he married long-time girlfriend, chess photographer and actress Eva Veronika Klein and the two were together until her death in 2007. On February 24, 2014 Hoffmann married fellow chess player Virginia D'Amico Hoffmann. Their wedding reception was held at the Marshall Chess Club. The two had dated 37 years earlier and were reunited in 2013 through mutual friends. They live in the Gramercy Park area of Manhattan in New York City.

Location Dinder lies approximately southeast of Khartoum, on either side of the Dinder River bounded to the north by the Rahad River. The town of Dinder ( northwest) acts as a gateway for tourists wishing to enter the Park. History The area of Dinder was heavily populated when it was first visited by Europeans in 1861. In the 1880s, at the time of the Mahdist War and a famine, the human population vanished. Alfred Harrison found only traces of human habitation in 1925. Dinder was established as a park in 1935 following the London Convention of 1933 and designated in 1979 as a member of the World Network of Biosphere Reserves. In 1983 the park was extended towards the west. Ecology Dinder National Park is ecologically significant because it falls on the ecotone between the Sahel and Ethiopian Highlands ecoregions. It contains three distinct ecosystems: *riverine - riparian zone *woodland *maya (oxbow lake). The park is home to 27 species of large mammals such as leopard, cheetah, more than 160 bird species, 32 fish species, and small mammals, bats, reptiles, and amphibians. It is in a major flyway used by birds migrating between Eurasia and Africa. There are many North African ostriches residing in the national park as well. Dinder National Park hosts a healthy population of lions lions. =Threats= The ecology of the park is threatened by encroachment from cattle herders who are being displaced from their traditional grazing lands by the expansion of crop agriculture, through the fundamental cause of expanding regional population. Populations of migrant grazers, including tiang, Roan, waterbuck and reebuck, are under additional pressure as land outside the park that they migrate across has been converted to farmland. Game counts between 1971 and 2001 have shown a precipitous decline in most large mammal species, with the population of waterbuck falling by 85%, reedbuck by 72%, and oribi by 68%. Other species have been extirpated in Dinder since was gazetted, including African bush elephant, black rhinoceros, hippopotamus, tora hartebeest, Nubian giraffe, Soemmerring's gazelle, and the Nile crocodile.

It was invented in 1946 by Cyrus W. Bemmels, a scientist working for Johnson and Johnson. A variety of grades of filament tape are available. Some have as much as 600 pounds of tensile strength per inch of width. Different types and grades of adhesive are also available. Most often, the tape is 12 mm (approx. 1/2 inch) to 24 mm (approx. 1 inch) wide, but it is also used in other widths. A variety of strengths, calipers, and adhesive formulations are available. Uses The tape is most often used as a closure for corrugated boxes such as a full overlap box, five panel folder, full telescope box. \\"L\\" shaped clips or strips are applied over the overlapping flap, extending 50 - 75 mm (2 - 3 inches) onto the box panels. Heavy loads or weak box construction may also be aided by the application of strips or bands of filament tape to the box. Application The tape can be applied manually with a stationary dispenser but is more often applied with a hand held tape dispenser: this allows the user to more efficiently place the tape on the box, cut it off, and rub it down. Automated machinery for application of tape to high speed lines is also common. Related products Some PSA tapes are available which have a highly oriented polypropylene backing with high strength in the long (machine) direction. Some of these have shaped filaments which help resist tearing across the tape. These tapes are sometimes used in a similar manner as filament reinforced tapes. Some filament tapes (or strapping tapes) are sometimes used similarly to strapping.

It dealt with the longings and dreams of a group of children whose neighborhood was being gentrified and who were forced to move out. The show was originally staged at the Dunes, where it ran for three years. It then moved to the Desert Inn, where it ran for another two years. In 1984, the show won the Eppie award for \\"Best Show of the Year\\". After its run in Vegas, the show briefly toured America, performing in such cities as Dallas, Chicago and St. Louis, ending with a run at Harrah's Atlantic City. Merritt and Donnelly became well known in Las Vegas after Donnelly was nicknamed \\"The Eyes of Dream Street\\" by the Las Vegas Sun and a photo of his eyes was plastered on newspapers and billboards all over town. Merritt, whose athletic choreography was unusual for audiences who were used to the \\"walking about\\" dancing popular in Vegas shows of the time, went on to choreograph many other shows, including the 1989 Academy Awards Show. Dream Street owed at least part of its success to its cast, including Forrest Gardner and Scherrie Payne (of The Supremes). The show was also home to many gifted young dancers, including Michael Fullington, Jerry Evans, Christine Scadina, Lezle Mogell, Charles McGowan and Macarena Gandarillas, who made the most of Merritt's tough, gritty style.

Its name means Job's well, due to the legend in which Job (Ayub) visited this place and made a well by striking the ground with his staff. The water of this well is still pure and is considered healing. The current building was constructed during the reign of Timur and features a Khwarazm-style conical dome uncommon in Bukhara. Site description Chashma-Ayub Mausoleum is in the middle of a small, ancient cemetery. The construction suffered some losses, but the preserved parts represent a combination of a harmonious entrance portal, and adjoining it are the remains of the western curtain wall. The construction layout of the portal is in a traditional pattern, made up in the form of two pylons, forming the niche overlapped by the semi vault. The II-shaped frame, the inside of which forms the obverse surface, tympanum, and ktoba, is finished with an inscription above the lancet arch. The northern part of the niche portal is a limited gable wall with a doorway. From the western end the portal is adjoined by a deep brick wall that measures 5.9 m, of which the western portion has been lost. The wall is in the form of a trapezoid with a large base. The central room is overlapped by the tent-peaked dome. Except for the proportions of the construction, this monument has well-considered and perfectly executed decoration, the basic part of which is concentrated on the portal. The most effective place in the general composition of the decoration is ktoba, filled with Arabic inscriptions on a background of botanical ornamentation. The portal frame on the external contour is marked by the II-shaped zone, strengthened by girikh from intertwining octahedrons, made of terracotta bricks. Glazed inserts in turquoise fill the central octahedral sockets. A tape borders the frame and ktoba. The historical value of the monument consists of the exact dating written on ktoba (1208-1209 .A.D.) or the 605th year of the Muslim Calendar.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5304/ HistoryWorld Heritage Status This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on 18 January 2008, in the Cultural category.

The team was also the rivals to the nearby Oil City Athletic Club. 1902 bidding war Franklin and Oil City, Pennsylvania had a lot of money tied up in their football teams. In 1902, during the teams' third meeting however, Oil City signed the entire team from the Pittsburgh Athletic Club, seven of the Philadelphia All-Stars, some players from a team located in Steubenville, Ohio and from Grove City College for that one game against Franklin. Since there was a large amount of hometown gambling on football games in 1902, this action resulted in all of the Franklin fans losing their bets to Oil City. However while losing the game, Franklin did manage to hold Oil City's all star team to a 10-0 score. 1903 Pre-season To avoid being out bid again by Oil City for football talent, Franklin's manager Bill Prince recruited an every star player inside of Pennsylvania to play for Franklin. After the team's loss against Oil City, Prince attended the first National Football League championship game between the Pittsburgh Stars and Philadelphia Athletics. Immediately after the game, Prince signed every important player in sight to Franklin. After seeing what Prince had done, Oil City forfeited their season due to a lack of players. All of the money that was to be gambled on the 1903 football contests between Franklin and Oil City, sat in a bank escrow account and was later returned to the gamblers. 1903 Season With every major football star under contract with Franklin, Prince decided to open up a challenge to every major professional football club in Pennsylvania. Many stars from the first NFL played for Franklin including Blondy Wallace and Eddie Wood who later became one of the first players to catch forward passes when they became legal in 1906.

Published by Friedrich Middelhauve Verlag in Cologne in 1949, the book is about a German soldier, Andreas, taking a train to Przemyśl in Poland. It was translated into English by Leila Vennewitz. The story addresses the experience of German soldiers during the Second World War on the Eastern Front, where fighting was particularly vicious and unforgiving. Böll had explored the same issue in A Soldier's Legacy, which was written in 1948 but published later. The Train Was on Time was his first published novel. Theodore Ziolkowski called it \\"an artistic tour de force.Ziolkowski, Theodore (Summer 1960). \\"Heinrich Böll: Conscience and Craft\\". Books Abroad. 34(3): 213–222. __TOC__ Synopsis \\"Why don't you get on?\\" a chaplain asked him when the train arrived. \\"Get on?\\" asked the soldier, amazed. \\"Why, I might want to hurl myself under the wheels, I might want to desert ... eh? What's the hurry? I might go crazy, I've a perfect right to, I've a perfect right to go crazy. I don't want to die, that's what's so horrible—that I don't want to die.\\" On his way to the war front, he meets two other Germans with whom he starts a dialogue and a short- term friendship; he also meets Olina, a Polish prostitute, who has been working for the anti-fascist partisans but who has become disillusioned with such activity, seeing it as begetting yet further cycles of violence and aggression rather than leading to a proper way out of the bellicosity of the situation. During their trip we learn much about horrors soldiers endure in the war, and the effect it leaves on a person. Andreas has a particularly passive (some might say stoic) attitude to his involvement in the conflict, and the inevitability of death (and the question of fate) hangs over the narrative in a tragic fashion. It is arguable that the only real choices in the novel, presented in its opening gambits, involve the place and manner of Andreas's death in the war, rather than the possibility of its evasion. This tragic fate seems to be circumvented to some extent when Andreas meets Olina and they plan an escape to the Carpathian mountains, but the eventual fate cannot (it appears) be overlooked. In this sense, connections can be made between the work and the structure of ancient Greek tragedies such as the story of Oedipus. In this short novel Böll attempted to follow the development of battle-induced posttraumatic stress disorder. There is also a religious dimension to the novel, given Andreas's friendship with a priest called Paul. Just before the fateful ending, Andreas muses \\"O God, my time has passed and what have I done with it? I have never done anything worth doing. I must pray, pray for all.\\" The book was translated into English by Leila Vennewitz.

As a non-partisan advocacy group, the BCHLA works with government and holds them accountable to promote wellness and prevent chronic disease. In 2006, after publishing The Winning Legacy advocacy paper, the Government of BC provided BCHLA with a $25 million grant to implement initiatives across the province that would support the achievement of the targets outlined in the paper. The initiatives, which focus on healthy eating, physical activity, tobacco reduction, and community capacity building are now underway in over 105 communities across British Columbia. As they continue to early 2010, BCHLA is continually working closely with ActNow BC and the Ministry of Healthy Living and Sport along with many other community partners. The Alliance continues its policy work and has developed a discussion paper, Healthy Futures for BC Families, on the social issues that can impede or enhance the healthy of a society. These issues include access to: affordable housing, early childhood development and care, income and food security, and supportive environments. Background The Alliance was formed in February 2003 with a mission to lead collaborative actions to promote physical activity, healthy eating, and living smoke-free in order to improve the overall health of British Columbians. In March 2006, the Alliance received \\"a one-time grant of $25.2 million to pursue recommendations outlined in their report, \\"The Winning Legacy - A plan for improving the health of British Columbians by 2010.\\" Health Minister George Abbott had said, \\"We are supporting programs that promote healthy living and prevent illness in our society. Research tells us that four risk factors are the major causes of our most common chronic diseases. Lifestyle choices about nutrition, exercise, tobacco use and healthy choices during pregnancy can make a real difference in our own health, and in the sustainability of the entire health-care system.\\" While the Alliance recognizes there is a wide range of chronic diseases, their primary focus is on the common risk factors and underlying determinants that contribute significantly to cancer, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease, and diabetes. =Goals= To reduce chronic disease in B.C., the Alliance has developed three specific goals: *Advocate for and support health promoting policies, environments, programs, and services. *Enhance collaboration among government, non-government and private sector organization. *Increase capacity of communities to create and sustain health promoting policies, environment, programs, and services. =Members= The BCHLA Logo Tree of member organizations Currently, the BC Healthy Living Alliance comprises nine member organizations. The first group of major non- governmental organizations that are involved in the prevention of chronic diseases include: The BC Lung Association, Canadian Diabetes Association Pacific, Heart & Stroke Foundation of BC and Yukon, and the Canadian Cancer Society, BC and Yukon Division. The second group of members is organizations with direct links to local governments and communities. These members are the Union of BC Municipalities and BC Recreation and Parks Association. Thirdly, BCHLA includes members of key health and wellness professionals. Dietitians of Canada BC Region, BC Pediatric Society, and the Public Health Association of BC are all members of the Alliance. In addition, the BCHLA has advisory representation from government related bodies including: BC Health Authorities, 2010 Legacies Now, Public Health Agency of Canada, Ministry of Healthy Living and Sport, and ActNow BC. Advocacy The BC Healthy Living Alliance \\"advocates for and supports health-promoting policies, environments, programs and services so that British Columbians have opportunities to be healthy.\\" In particular, the BCHLA have written two evidence-based papers. =The Winning Legacy= The B.C. Risk Factor Intervention Plan, which the BCHLA calls The Winning Legacy, was initially presented to Premier Gordon Campbell and the BC Government on March 3, 2005. It is a \\"plan for improving the health of British Columbians by 2010 by simultaneous improvements in four risk factors of tobacco use, unhealthy weights, unhealthy eating, and physical inactivity.\\" The Winning Legacy explains that much of the chronic disease burden in the province is preventable by addressing these factors. BCHLA estimated that \\"these risk factors cost the B.C. economy approximately $3.8 billion annually\\". Caring for British Columbians with acute and chronic health conditions is using up an increasing proportion of government expenditures. This position paper presents 27 recommendations that addressed the aforementioned lifestyle risk factors related to chronic disease. In particular, these recommendations were summarized and divided into the following categories: Regulatory and Economic Interventions, Community-Based Interventions, School-Based Interventions, Workplace-Based Interventions, Clinical Interventions and Management, Specific Populations, and Surveillance, Evaluations, and other Administrative Costs. The Winning Legacy was estimated to cost $1.1 billion over a period of 6 years, which equals $41 per year for each British Columbian. Discussions A series of policy discussion forums were held across the province to discuss the social issues affecting health. The first forum was held on October 2, 2008 in Vancouver, British Columbia. The following three regional forums in the Interior, North, and Vancouver Island were held early 2009. The Interior Region discussion took place on February 13, 2009 in Williams Lake, with videoconferencing sites in Cranbrook, Kamloops, Kelowna, and Trail. Prince George was the main location for the March 12 North forum, which also hosted videoconferencing to Burns Lake, Dawson Creek, Fort St. John, Smithers, Terrace, Prince Rupert, and Queen Charlotte City. The last Healthy Futures for BC Families policy discussion was on March 25, 2009 in the city of Nanaimo on Vancouver Island. The forums were intended to gain local perspectives from \\"health, government, academia, business, and Aboriginal communities\\" regarding the social issues affecting health and to seek solutions to improve these social conditions. Mary Collins, the Director of the BC Healthy Living Alliance Secretariat, said \\"research indicates access to income, employment, affordable housing, healthy food, education and early childhood development supports have a greater influence on the physical and mental healthy and life expectancy of British Columbians than genetics or any other single factor.\\" In June 2008, Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, stated in a report to Parliament that combating poverty, especially amongst the youth, is key to improving Canadians' physical and mental health. After gathering information from the different regions across the province, the Alliance will produce their final report in the following months. The final report will be presented to the provincial and federal government, health authorities, and other community leaders.

The facility is commonly known as Matrosskaya Tishina (, lit. \\"Seaman's Silence\\"), after the name of the street on which it is located in north-eastern Moscow. Matrosskaya Tishina is operated by the Federal Penitentiary Service, famously holding Mikhail Khodorkovsky and some plotters of the 1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt. History The site of Matrosskaya Tishina has been home to detention facilities since 1775, when an insane asylum ran by a charitable organization was opened, and in 1870 the facility was reformed as Moscow Prison with an occupancy for 300 men and 150 women. In 1912, new purpose-built prison blocks designed by architect Boris Alberti were erected, and in 1918 was transformed into a reformatory for juvenile convicts. Matrosskaya Tishina was established in its current form in 1945 by Soviet authorities following World War II. It was operated by the Ministry of Internal Affairs as No. 14 of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Moscow Area from 1946 until 1956, when the prison was renamed SIZO No. 1 of the Moscow Main Department of Internal Affairs. Initially, the new prison had two main buildings, accommodating more than 2,000 adult prisoners, before being increased to three buildings. From 1949 to 1953, the third building housed a special prison containing war criminals from the Third Reich, as well as prisoners who worked in the Special Technical Bureau of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. From 1953 until 1997, the third building housed juvenile delinquents, and since 1999 has housed the tuberculosis department. Since 1997, SIZO No. 1 was subordinated to the Main Penitentiary Department (GUIN) of the Ministry of Justice of the Russian Federation, and at that time it contained up to 5,000 prisoners under investigation or awaiting sentencing. Escapes Only three prisoners have been able to successfully escape from Matrosskaya Tishina. On June 5, 1995, Alexander Solonik, a notorious hitman and member of a prominent Kurgan criminal group, managed to escape from the prison. On May 2, 2004, Sergey Ershov, a Ukrainian man escaped by dismantling brickwork and breaking the perimeter fence, receiving numerous injuries in the process. However, since Ershov was detained less than 24 hours after the escape, it was recognized only as an attempt. On March 13, 2003, Aleksei Djulger, a prisoner from Kursk given right to free movement by prison authorities, disappeared and was believed to have escaped. Djulger was found several days later hiding in the rubble of construction debris on the prison grounds, eating waste from a container in a nearby garbage can. Djulger had been gambling with his cellmates and subsequently lost a large sum of money, deciding to hide rather than risk persecution for his gambling debts. On May 7, 2013, Oleg Topalov, accused of theft and double murder, escaped after pulling himself through a hole in the ceiling of his cell he had dug solely with a metal spoon, climbing onto the roof and over the perimeter fence. Authorities blamed the non-observant and corrupt security guards for Topalov's escape, as he had escaped using civilian clothing and mountaineering equipment bought from a guard. Topalov was apprehended the following day in Izmailovsky Park.

The dam was demolished and removed in 2009.\\"Oregon dam's demise lets the Rogue River run,\\" LA Times From 1921 until the spring of 2009, the Savage Rapids Dam almost entirely functioned for irrigation purposes, and it did not provide any flood control, hydro-electric power, inland waterway, or other significant beneficial uses. It only provided very minor recreational or wildlife (such as migratory birds) benefits. Because this dam's facilities for accommodating migrating salmon did not meet current legal or practical standards, the \\"Grants Pass Irrigation District\\" (the GPID) had agreed to allow this dam to be demolished and replaced by pumps. The GPID had entered into a U.S. Federal Court consent decree to this effect. Construction of the replacement irrigation pumps began in 2006, and these pumps started service on May 11, 2009. The final dam demolition and removal was completed in October 2009. This project represented one of the largest dam removals ever undertaken in the United States, and it is expected to have significant and enduring positive impacts on the valuable sport and commercial salmon fisheries of Oregon.  History  The Grants Pass Irrigation District was organized by water users in January 1917, and it then contained about of land. In 1920, a diversion dam design was adopted to provide for a direct diversion system with permanent pumping units at a site on the Rogue River about five miles (8 km) east of the town of Grants Pass, Oregon. The Savage Rapids Dam was dedicated November 5, 1921, and this marked the beginning of the operational history of the water district. The Savage Rapids Dam and its related facilities were badly damaged by a flood in 1927. Emergency repairs were made at that time, but the lack of sufficient funds prevented satisfactory completion of the work. By 1949, the cost of maintenance had become prohibitive for the GPID, and soon the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation was asked to replace or repair significant portions of the facility using Federal funds. Construction of a new buried pipeline under the river to replace the old suspension pipeline was completed during the winter of 1949-50. Savage Rapids Dam was rehabilitated from March 25, 1953, to February 22, 1955. Fish ladders on both the north and south sides of the river were upgraded in the late 1950s. Improvements to the current fish passage facilities at the dam were completed in 1978. =Path to removal agreement= Although the dam removal agreement was widely hailed as a great success for all parties involved, the path to agreement took many years and included a great deal of conflict.\\"Savage Rapids Dam's Days Are Numbered,\\" Medford Mail Tribune. In 1988, the conservation, science, and sport fishing groups WaterWatch, the American Fisheries Society, and the Rogue Flyfishers protested the GPID’s state-level application for a water right to divert additional water from the Rogue River, and commenced negotiations with the GPID over water use and fish passage. In 1990, WaterWatch reached an agreement with the GPID and the state on a temporary water rights permit, conditional upon completion of a study on water conservation alternatives and fish passage alternatives for the dam. Significantly, this study evaluated dam removal as an alternative. Completed in 1994, the study recommended the dam's removal. The \\"Oregon Water Resources Commission\\" then ordered an extension of the GPID’s temporary water right permit on three conditions: The district was required to replace the dam with pumps, to remove the dam, and to reduce its irrigation water diversion from the river. However, from 1995 through 2000, the GPID board of directors reneged on its commitment to dam removal and instead waged a political and legal battle to keep the dam.Elizabeth Grossman, Watershed: The Undamming of America, Counterpoint, New York, 2002. p. 148 This led to litigation in state and federal courts. In 1997, the National Marine Fisheries Service listed the Rogue coho salmon population as threatened under the Federal Endangered Species Act and determined that the Savage Rapids Dam caused significant harm to coho salmon. In 1998, after the GPID failed to submit a habitat conservation plan for the dam, as required under the ESA, NMFS sued the District. WaterWatch and the State of Oregon were successful in winning a state contested case, which resulted in the cancellation of the GPID’s temporary water right. This allowed WaterWatch to enter into direct negotiations with the GPID and forge a settlement of all federal and state litigation. This was formalized in a Consent Decree entered in August 2001. The Decree required the GPID to work for federal legislation to remove the dam and replace it with pumps and set a specific timeline for dam removal. The irrigation district also agreed to transfer of its water right to an instream water right devoted to fish. This represents the largest water right transfer of its kind in Oregon and one of the largest such transfers in the western United States. In 2002, the Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board (OWEB) pledged $3,000,000 toward the dam removal, the largest single grant OWEB had made until that time.Oregon Watershed Enhancement Board, \\"Exciting Progress in Removing Fish Killer\\" This grant became a catalyst for federal legislation authorizing the Bureau of Reclamation to remove the dam, which passed the U.S. Congress in December 2003. In all, the removal project is expected to cost some $40,000,000, with the funds primarily coming from federal government.U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, \\"Savage Rapids Dam Removal\\" Additionally, the replacement pumping system has not been without its faults. Several times over successive irrigation seasons, pumps have been covered by sediment from the river, resulting in expensive river dredging. These issues were presented as concerns prior to the dam removal as the Bureau of Reclamation has studied impacts of sediment migration after dam removals. = 2009 removal timeline = * April 7: Began building first coffer dam * Mid-April: First “wet” test of new pumps * Late April: Rerouted Rogue River to south side * Early May: Irrigation began with new pumps * June-July: Demolition of north half of dam * Nov.-Dec.: Completed dam demolition  Facilities description  Savage Rapids Dam prior to removal Savage Rapids Dam consisted of a 16-bay spillway section and a hydraulic-driven pumping plant section at the right abutment. The maximum height of the spillway section is about . The first seven bays at the right end of the dam were multiple arches with buttresses on centers. The remaining nine bays have a concrete gravity section below the gates. Spillway control was originally provided by 16 wooden-faced radial gates, each wide and high. Later, radial gates were replaced with metal stoplogs, and one double- gated river outlet with a capacity of was installed at the center of the dam. During the irrigation season, the stoplogs were used to raise the reservoir's elevation . Prior to the construction of the new pumping system, the main pumping plant at the diversion dam consisted of two hydraucone turbine units that operated at a head. One turbine drove a centrifugal pump with a capacity of against a head, and supplied water to the South Highline Canal. The other turbine drove two pumps connected in series, with a capacity of against a head of , and supplies water to the Tokay Canal.  Reasons for removal  The Rogue River in southwestern Oregon is one of the nation's most outstanding rivers and the second largest producer of salmon in Oregon outside of the Columbia basin.\\"Salmon runs on Rogue expected to revive once dams come down,\\" Oregonian Because of its scenic beauty, world-class whitewater, and its internationally renowned salmon and steelhead fishery, it was one of the original group of rivers designated as “wild and scenic” with the passage of the federal Wild and Scenic Rivers Act in 1968.U.S. Bureau of Land Management, \\"Rogue River\\" The Bureau of Land Management estimates that some 25,000 visitors use the Rogue River each year. Rogue River, Oregon. The Savage Rapids Dam had long been considered the biggest fish killer on the Rogue River.WaterWatch, \\"Savage Rapids Dam Removal\\"\\"Clock Ticks for Savage Rapids Dam,\\" Medford Mail Tribune. Located at river mile 107, the dam was the first human-built obstruction that native salmon and steelhead trout encounter during their migration upstream from the ocean to spawn in-river. Upstream of the Savage Rapids Dam, there are over 500 (square?) miles of salmon and steelhead trout spawning habitat, including 50 miles on the mainstream of the Rogue River. All of this river's prized spring chinook salmon spawn upstream of the dam, and this dam impeded passage of significant portions of the four other runs of salmon and steelhead in the Rogue River, including the coho salmon, which is listed as \\"threatened\\" under the Federal Endangered Species Act. This dam's fish ladders and fish screens did not meet current legal or practical standards.U.S. Bureau of Reclamation \\"Savage Rapids Dam\\" The north ladder only operated during the irrigation season, had poor attraction flows and was generally inadequate. The south ladder had poor attraction flows and it was difficult to regulate flows within the ladder. During the spring and fall, when dam operations were starting up and shutting down, upstream fish passage could be totally blocked. Adult fish were delayed, injured, and sometimes killed while trying to navigate the dam in their upstream spawning migration, thereby reducing overall spawning success. Downstream juvenile fish were impinged on and entrained through the screens over the dam's diversion and pump-turbine systems. There was increased predation of young fish in the seasonal reservoir pool created by the dam and after juveniles pass through the dam's bypass systems. There was a loss of 3.5 miles of fall chinook salmon spawning habitat that could be reclaimed from the elimination of the seasonal reservoir pool when the dam was removed. According to a 1995 U.S. Bureau of Reclamation’s Planning Report and Environmental Statement (PRES), removal of the dam would increase fish escapement at the site by 22%.U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, \\"Fish Passage Report, Savage Rapids Dam, Oregon, Planning Report and Environmental Statement\\"12 MB pdf This translates into approximately 114,000 more salmon and steelhead each year (87,900 that would be available for sport and commercial harvest and 26,700 that would escape to spawn) valued at approximately $5,000,000 annually.

The city consisted of a citadel, two settlements, and a rabod (suburb). Poykent is currently under consideration for inscription as a UNESCO World Heritage site. Site description According to the archaeological research, Poykent was founded as a small village in the 4th century B.C., and was later transformed into a fortress. During that period, it was a trade center, as the city connected Southern countries (Bactria, India, Iran) with Northern countries (Front of Ural, Coast of Volga, Northern Caucus). Poykent was one of the important military and trade centers of the Western borders of the Sogd. Due to the development of the Great Silk Road and joining with Poykent fortress have been founded first and second sites of ancient settlement. Hence the city Poykent was founded. According to Chinese chronicles, this city was under the \\"An\\" (Bukhara) kingdom and was the centre of \\"Bi\\" khanate. It has also been noted that in Poykent there was no khokim (governor), the city was ruled by traders' council, and in the full sense of the word the city was a republic in the 6th-7th century. The scientists of Institute of Archaeology of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan have carried out scientific research in the ruins of the city for a long time. As a result, Zoroastrian temples, a palace, and a mosque, built in the 9th century, and remnants of a tower were found in citadel. In the inner part of city were discovered defensive walls, a gate, roads, and the remains of [living] quarters (makhallas), while on the outside rabads (suburbs) of the city - there are pottery centers and caravanserais. According to the researcher, due to the inaccessibility of the lower flaw of Zarafshon River, the city ceased to exist in the middle of the 9th century.Poykent - UNESCO World Heritage Centre HistoryWorld Heritage Status This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on 18 January 2008, in the Cultural category.

It was the eighth named storm of the season, as well as the fourth hurricane. It formed on September 21 between Puerto Rico and Bermuda, partially related to previous Hurricane Gabrielle. Humberto passed about 140 miles (225 km) west of Bermuda, which spared the island with its strongest winds. After weakening and believed to be on the verge of dissipating, Humberto unexpectedly restrengthened to the southeast of Atlantic Canada. The intensification was short-lived and the storm dissipated on September 27. There were a series of significant observational flights into the hurricane that produced a wealth of data on the structure of hurricanes. Meteorological history Hurricane Humberto originated from a trough that extended southwestward from Hurricane Gabrielle, which had previously moved across Florida into the western Atlantic Ocean. The trough interacted with an upper-level low, resulting in an increase of convection, or thunderstorms, in the region. A surface low developed on September 19, and it gradually organized as it moved westward. After deep convection developed over the center, it is estimated the system reached tropical depression strength () on September 21, about halfway between Puerto Rico and Bermuda. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) first published an advisory on the storm at 11 AM EDT, identifying it as Tropical Depression Ten. Upon its formation, the depression moved northwestward toward a break in the mid-level ridge. On satellite imagery, the depression looked well-organized, with banding features, outflow, and convection, although Hurricane Hunters had difficulty locating a closed center of circulation. The unfavorable conditions were from the upper-level low to its southwest, which was producing wind shear over the storm; nevertheless, the NHC anticipated strengthening. On September 22, the surface circulation rapidly became better organized, and based on confirmation from the Hurricane Hunters, the NHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Humberto. Throughout its life, the storm was smaller than average, and as it moved around the subtropical ridge, it gradually intensified. Tropical Storm Humberto developed an eye feature on September 23. Shortly thereafter, the storm reached hurricane status about 175 miles (285 km) west-southwest of Bermuda. After passing about 140 miles (225 km) west of Bermuda, Hurricane Humberto turned more to the northeast, and reached Category 2 status on the Saffir–Simpson scale. Subsequently, strong upper-level westerlies began affecting the storm, which caused a marked decrease in intensity; by September 25, the winds decreased to 75 mph (120 km/h), or minimal hurricane status. At that time, the NHC expected Humberto to continue weakening due to the shear, as well as steadily decreasing water temperatures. Unexpectedly, the weakening trend stopped, as the steering winds came from the same direction behind the hurricane. It slowed down slightly, and on September 26 the eye of the hurricane became much more distinct. Humberto quickly re-intensified and reached peak winds of 105 mph (170 km/h), while located about 200 miles (320 km) south-southeast of Sable Island, off the coast of Nova Scotia. Just as quickly it strengthened, the hurricane began weakening again. The eye became distorted as the convection became asymmetrical, due to the cooler waters and stronger westerlies. Initially, the NHC forecast Humberto to become extratropical. On September 27, it turned more eastward and later to the east- southeast, and Humberto weakening to tropical storm status about 400 miles (645 km) southeast of Newfoundland. The cloud pattern became increasingly elongated and removed from the center, and late on the 27th, the circulation of Humberto degenerated into an open trough in the far northern Atlantic Ocean. The remnants were expected to be absorbed quickly by a larger extratropical storm to its north. Horizontal wind profiles of Hurricane Humberto on September 23 There were three major aircraft flights into the hurricane over a three-day period which, according to NASA, \\"were the most comprehensive measurements of the structure of the hurricane ever recorded.\\" The flights were designed to obtain data for better hurricane forecasting. Impact and naming Prior to its passage by Bermuda, the National Hurricane Center advised the residents \\"should monitor the progress of Humberto until it is safely past.\\" On September 23 when the hurricane passed the island, the hurricane-force winds extended 30 miles (50 km) from the center, while tropical storm force winds only extended 105 miles (170 km) from the center. As a result, Bermuda only experienced peak sustained winds of 27 mph (44 km/h), with gusts to 43 mph (69 km/h). During its passage, the island also recorded 1.69 inches (4.3 cm) of rainfall. Only two ships recorded tropical storm-force winds, both of which were away from the center. Some higher surf was recorded along the New Jersey coastline. In September 2001, two men sought to break the record for sailing the quickest time from New York City to Melbourne, Australia; Humberto disrupted their early path slightly, but they ultimately broke the record by 28 hours. Later in its path, there were several marine warnings issued for offshore Newfoundland, although no severe weather affected coastal Atlantic Canada. Overall, there were no reports of casualties or damage from the hurricane.

The school was founded as the Humphrey Perkins Grammar School in 1717 in the will of Humphrey Perkins. Perkins was born in Barrow upon Soar and went to the University of Cambridge before becoming the rector of Holme Pierrepont, Nottinghamshire, until his death in 1717. He left money for a grammar school to be built in Barrow upon Soar, and after land was acquired on an orchard near the centre of the village, the school opened in 1735 with 32 pupils. In 1902 the school moved to larger premises on Cotes Road, with the school's first non-clergyman headmaster, Fernsby, and 33 pupils. Of these pupils 32 were boys with just one girl, Nora May Wall. In 1927 the then headmaster, Keeble, introduced a school uniform of black blazer, badge and ties. Examples of this uniform are still kept by the current headmistress, along with a school rugby shirt. The four houses were named after pre-eminent Leicestershire families as Beaumont, Grey, Hastings and Latimer. In 1947 the grammar school closed and a secondary modern school was opened on the same site. In 1956 this became a single bilateral school, with approximately 500 pupils. Dunn became headmaster in 1960, and discussions began about whether Humphrey Perkins or the nearby Rawlins Grammar School at Quorn would be the 'Upper School' in the new two-tier Leicestershire education model. In 1966 Humphrey Perkins was converted to a junior high school for 11- to 14-year- olds, with some 1000 pupils. In September 2010, Peter Nutkins joined the school as Headmaster, and the school underwent a period of rapid reorganisation and development. On 1 January 2012 Humphrey Perkins became an Academy School and converted to an 11–16 that same year, taking older pupils from September 2013. The school was inspected in 2011–12 and issued with a notice to improve after being judged inadequate. Only 14 months later the school was judged as 'good' by the return OFSTED inspection as the improvements that had taken place brought about change. Pupils within the school were given iPads to encourage creativity. The school held training events for other schools on the use of the devices in the classroom. Nutkins took a strong stance on including creative subjects in the curriculum and is a member of the Heads for Arts national lobby group. In September 2017, most iPads were removed from the school, with pupils no longer having them, but the staff still use them.

He was created by writer Stephen Miller and portrayed by Peter Cowper in George Mihalka's original My Bloody Valentine (1981) and Richard John Walters in Patrick Lussier's remake My Bloody Valentine 3D (2009). In the lore of the films, he is an urban legend of the fictitious town of Valentine Bluffs in which he is believed to unleash a wrath upon those who partake in the forbidden Valentine's Day dance. He has been depicted as an antagonist in both films, whether through the flashback scenes, or his persona influencing a central character's descent into psychopathy. The character is widely recognized for his distinctive gas mask and miner gear. Warden has gained a cult status in the horror genre fandom despite only appearing in two films and has become a popularized slasher villain character in recent years. AppearancesFilms=My Bloody Valentine Harry first appears inside a mine shaft, with a female miner that performs a strip tease and fondles with his breathing tube. Harry brutally kills her with a mining pick. When the town's police chief Jake Newby receives an anonymous box of Valentine chocolates containing a human heart and a note warning that murders will begin if the dance proceeds, he checks the mental institution where Harry Warden was incarcerated, but they have no record of him. It is later revealed that the murders were done by the young miner Axel who witnessed his father (one of the supervisors) being murdered by Harry Warden when he was a child and was since traumatized by the event ever since while Harry Warden died five years before the events of the film. My Bloody Valentine 3D On Valentine's Day 1997, Harry Warden and several other miners are trapped in a cave-in; Warden murders the other miners with a pickaxe to conserve air. Warden is rescued, albeit in a coma; he wakes up 1 year later, he murders several hospital staff and patients, before heading back to the mines. Warden breaks into a party held at the mines and kills multiple partygoers, only to be shot by Sheriff Burke when he attempts to murder Tom, the last person still in the mine. Warden escapes from Burke and his posse by going deeper into the mines and using an escape hatch, but Burke and his posse discover him. In an Afro or vigilantism, they fatally shoot Warden and bury his body in the woods. Ten years later, murders begin again leading to speculation that Warden is back. Though Warden’s gear and body disappear, it is eventually revealed Tom had become the killer after suffering a psychotic break and developing a split personality based on Harry. DevelopmentConception= He is depicted as a once normal man who descended into madness when his bosses weren't paying attention to their workers, which led to the disaster and subsequently Warden's insanity. He is depicted similar to Michael Myers and Jason Voorhees in that he is a deranged silent killer who lurks in the shadows. In Canadian Cinema Since the 1980s: At the Heart of the World, Mihalka stated, \\"Harry Warden [the original Valentine's Day killer] wasn't born evil; he was a hardworking guy who went insane when the bosses neglected the people that worked for them, causing a disaster. I really insisted on the subtext. Okay, it's not exactly a treatise on Das Kapita, but at the same time, that's who the character is.\\" =Design= Writer Alexandra Heller-Nicholas notes that Warden's attire, the gas mask and mining gear, aren't exclusively worn by him throughout the film as it is set in a working class town but that this adds to the enigma of the character's identity as multiple people are seen in the same equipment throughout the film. He describes the close-ups of the mask during the killings as to what makes the figure frightening. He asserts that this also pertains to the gas masks connection to modern warfare and environmental disasters. Reception Film journalist J. A. Kerswell described Warden as iconic: \\"The mad miner is one of the subgenre's best and most iconic villains: silent and menacing in his gas mask, carrying his pickax ready for mayhem.\\" Writer Don Sumner called Warden a \\"great villain\\". In Understanding Social Divisions, Shaun Best compared Warden to Hannibal Lecter, Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, Leatherface, Norman Bates, and Jason Voorhees, stating that they all \\"reinforce the stigma surrounding mental illness and present a powerful picture of people who suffer from mental illness as potential psycho- killers.\\" Matt Molgaard of Horror Freak News praised the character, saying, \\"You know, it really doesn’t matter who sports the mask of the Miner: be it Harry Warden, Tom Hanniger, or Billy Crystal. It’s all about the sense of inescapable dread that sinks to the bottom of the stomach the moment that mask earns screen time. Of all the legendary masks horror freaks discuss on a regular basis (Myers, Voorhees, Ghostface, etc., etc.), this one is certainly one of the more frightening to behold. The odd thing is I can’t even fully explain why that is. Perhaps it is better that I don’t over-analyze things and just respect the Miner and his mask for what they are: kick ass, top notch additions to the genre! Don’t bypass the 2009 remake simply because you’re a purist: it’s awfully entertaining and sports one of the most awkward (therefore must-see) nude scenes I’ve seen in 31 years!\\" J. A. Kerswell praised the character writing, \\"The mad miner is one of the subgenre's best and most iconic villains: silent and menacing in his gas mask, carrying a pickax ready for mayhem.

Closing questions is a main differentiation from other Q&A; sites like Yahoo! Answers and a way to prevent low quality questions. The mechanism was overhauled in 2013; questions edited after being put \\"on hold\\" now appear in a review queue. Jeff Atwood stated in 2010 that duplicate questions are not seen as a problem but rather they constitute an advantage if such additional questions drive extra traffic to the site by multiplying relevant keyword hits in search engines. Stack Overflow has over 10 million registered users, and it exceeded 16 million questions in mid 2018. Based on the type of tags assigned to questions, the top eight most discussed topics on the site are: JavaScript, Java, C#, PHP, Android, Python, jQuery, and HTML. Stack Overflow also has a Jobs section to assist developers in finding their next opportunity. For employers, Stack Overflow provides tools to brand their business, advertise their openings on the site, and source candidates from Stack Overflow's database of developers who are open to being contacted.  History  The website was created by Jeff Atwood and Joel Spolsky in 2008. On 31 July 2008, Jeff Atwood sent out invitations encouraging his subscribers to take part in the private beta of the new website, limiting its use to those willing to test out the new software. On 15 September 2008 it was announced that the public beta version was in session and that the general public was now able to use it to seek assistance on programming related issues. The design of the Stack Overflow logo was decided by a voting process. On 3 May 2010, it was announced that Stack Overflow had raised $6 million in venture capital from a group of investors led by Union Square Ventures. In 2019, Stack Overflow named Prashanth Chandrasekar as its chief executive officer and Teresa Dietrich as its chief product officer. =Content criteria = Stack Overflow only accepts questions about programming that are tightly focused on a specific problem. Questions of a broader nature–or those inviting answers that are inherently a matter of opinion– are usually rejected by the site's users, and marked as closed. The sister site softwareengineering.stackexchange.com is intended to be a venue for broader queries, e.g. general questions about software development. = Security breach = In early May 2019, an update was deployed to Stack Overflow's development version. It contained a bug which allowed an attacker to grant themselves privileges in accessing the production version of the site. Stack Overflow published on their blog that approximately 250 public network users were affected by this breach, which \\"could have returned IP address, names, or emails\\".  Statistics  A 2013 study has found that 75% of users only ask one question, 65% only answer one question, and only 8% of users answer more than 5 questions. To empower a wider group of users to ask questions and then answer, Stack Overflow created a mentorship program resulting in users having a 50% increase in score on average. As of 2011, 92% of the questions were answered, in a median time of 11 minutes. Since 2013, the Stack Exchange network software automatically deletes closed questions that meet certain criteria, including having no answers in a certain amount of time. , 443,000 of the 1.3 million registered users had answered at least one question, and of those, approximately 6,000 (0.46% of the total user count) had earned a reputation score greater than 5000. Reputation can be gained fastest by answering questions related to tags with lower expertise density, doing so promptly (in particular being the first one to answer a question), being active during off-peak hours, and contributing to diverse areas. In 2016, 1.5 million posts were deleted, of which about 8% were deleted by moderators.  Technology  Stack Overflow is written in C# using the ASP.NET MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, and Microsoft SQL Server for the database and the Dapper object-relational mapper used for data access. Unregistered users have access to most of the site's functionality, while users who sign in can gain access to more functionality, such as asking or answering a question, establishing a profile and being able to earn reputation to allow functionality like editing questions and answers without peer review or voting to close a question.  Reception  The site's culture has been criticized for being needlessly harsh, abrasive, and unfriendly, something which has been recognized by several Stack Overflow employees. A study from the University of Maryland found that Android developers that used only Stack Overflow as their programming resource tended to write more insecure code than those who used only the official Android developer documentation from Google.Y.

The network in Indiana gradually evolved in the 1830s and 1840s, reached its peak during the 1850s, and continued until slavery was abolished throughout the United States at the end of the American Civil War in 1865. It is not known how many fugitive slaves escaped through Indiana on their journey to Michigan and Canada. An unknown number of Indiana's abolitionists, anti-slavery advocates, and people of color, as well as Quakers and other religious groups illegally operated stations (safe houses) along the network. Some of the network's operatives have been identified, including Levi Coffin, the best-known of Indiana's Underground Railroad leaders. In addition to shelter, network agents provided food, guidance, and, in some cases, transportation to aid the runaways. Most of the fugitives who entered Indiana followed one of three general routes after crossing the Ohio River from Kentucky. A western route, which typically began in Indiana's southwestern counties near Evansville, continued north along the Wabash River or through several of the state's western counties toward the Indiana-Michigan border. A central route from Indiana counties began after crossing the Ohio River from the Louisville, Kentucky, area and passed through central and northern Indiana before entering Michigan. An eastern route from southeastern Indiana counties followed stations along the Indiana-Ohio border. A smaller number of fugitive slaves entered Indiana from Cincinnati, Ohio. Today, only a few Underground Railroad sites in Indiana are open to the public, including the Catherine and Levi Coffin home (called the \\"Grand Central Station of the Underground Railroad\\") in Wayne County and Eleutherian College in Jefferson County. Other sites have been identified with state historic markers, an ongoing effort. History Despite the risks of being captured and sold into bondage, some free people of color illegally provided aid to fugitive slaves in the early years of the Underground Railroad's operations. As more fugitive slaves came into Indiana in the 1820s, a growing number of white abolitionists and antislavery advocates took part the network, especially after 1850, when federal fugitive laws made it more difficult for runaways to make their escape to Canada. The Underground Railroad gradually evolved in the 1830s and 1840s, reaching its peak during the 1850s, and remained in operation until 1865, when slavery was abolished throughout the United States at the end of the American Civil War. =Prior to 1816= Although slavery was prohibited within the Northwest Territory and the Indiana Territory prior to Indiana's statehood in 1816, early residents disagreed on whether slavery should be allowed in the territory. In addition, federal and territorial laws did not prevent residents from enslaving others through indentured servitude.Regan-Dinius, p. 19.Underground Railroad, United States National Park Service, p. 51. The proslavery faction of the territorial government adopted legislation in 1803 that allowed involuntary servitude to circumvent Article VI of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787 that prohibited slavery. Passage of an indenture act in 1805 also allowed slaveholders to bring slaves purchased outside the territory into Indiana and bind them into service as indentured servants.Barnhart and Riker, pp. 347–48. In addition, passage of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 enforced slaveholders' rights to pursue, retrieve, and return African Americans to bondage in the South. Those who provided aid to fugitives or interfered with their capture were subject to fines and prison terms. In the early 1800s, early leaders of the antislavery movement in the Indiana Territory included Quaker settlers living in the eastern part of the territory. As their numbers and others joined the movement, the antislavery faction became the dominant political group. In 1810, antislavery politicians had gained sufficient influence to repeal the 1803 and 1805 laws that supported slavery in the territory.Barnhart and Riker, pp. 350 and 360. =First decades after statehood= When Indiana became a state in 1816, antislavery supporters were successful in getting the delegates at the state constitutional convention to officially abolish slavery and involuntary servitude under the new state's constitution. Although free people of color who lived in the Indiana did not have the same legal rights as other residents,Barnhart and Riker, pp. 457–58 and 460.African Americans in Indiana could not vote, serve on juries in a trial involving a white person, or send their children to public schools, among other restrictions, until laws were later amended. In spite of the inequalities, some free people of color and fugitive slaves settled in the territory. See: Thornbrough, Indiana in the Civil War Era, 1850–1880, p. 14. by the time that it became a state, Indiana along with Ohio and the adjacent territories (Illinois Territory and Michigan Territory) were beginning to be known as refuges for runaway slaves. Early abolitionist leader Dennis Pennington The Indiana General Assembly passed \\"man-stealing laws\\" in 1816 with additional legislation passed in 1818 to prevent bounty hunters and slavecatchers from abducting and forcibly removing any person from the state without first before a judge or justice of the peace for a hearing.Dunn, v. 1, p. 341. Indiana's \\"man-stealing\\" legislation soon brought the state into conflict with Kentucky, its neighboring slave state. In November 1818, Indiana state senator Dennis Pennington brought suit in the Harrison County, Indiana, Circuit Court against three Kentucky men under the state's man-stealing laws. Pennington charged that the three men had illegally captured a woman of color named Susan in Corydon, Indiana, and had forcibly taken her to Kentucky. Jonathan Jennings, he governor of Indiana, tried to have the men extradited to Indiana for trial, but Gabriel Slaughter, the governor of Kentucky, declined on constitutional grounds.Dunn, v. 1, pp. 343–44.Gresham, v. 1, p. 42. In border states such as Indiana, some individuals supported slavery while others opposed it or had neutral opinions about the issue and did not take any action. Despite the disagreements within his own state, Indiana's U.S. Senator Noah Noble, who was elected governor of Indiana in 1831, supported the antislavery sentiment by voting against granting statehood to Missouri in 1820 because of its proslavery stance. (The law slavery debate continued in Congress, but Missouri gained its statehood as part of the Missouri Compromise.)Dunn, v. 1, p. 348. In the decades leading up to the Civil War, some individuals became abolitionists who sought an end to slavery through legal means; others became involved in the Underground Railroad and actively aided runaway slaves. Antislavery groups were not in agreement on how they should respond. Some individuals joined antislavery societies forming in the non-slaveholding states, including Indiana, to assist runaway slaves. =Federal fugitive slave laws= A common image used in runaway slave ads. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 reinforced prior fugitive slave laws dating from 1793 and protected the rights of slaveholders, as well as the slavecatchers who came into Indiana to capture runaways. These laws also punished those who participated in Underground Railroad activities, causing much of their assistance to be conducted in greater secrecy. In addition, enforcement of the federal fugitive slave laws made it riskier for fugitives and free people of color who aided them to remain in Indiana. Free people of color were also more vulnerable to harassment and kidnapping, especially those living in counties along the Ohio River.Regan-Dinius, p. 21. Bounty hunters (slavecatchers), mostly operating in the southern part of the state, offered their services and knowledge of the area to southerners searching for runaways.Passage of the fugitive slave law in 1850 meant that bounty hunters and slavecatchers could more aggressively pursue runaway slaves, which included the authority to enter Indiana and deputize any American citizen, even those who opposed slavery, to assist them in capturing the runaways. See Gresham, v. 1, p. 32–33. Also: Hanlon, p. 43. In addition, free blacks could become victims when slavecatchers could not find runaway slaves. Bounty hunters and slavecatchers might seize free blacks, claiming them to be runaways, and bring them to the Southern United States to be sold into bondage. In one incident in the early 1850s, for example, slavecatchers seized two free blacks working on the Wabash and Erie Canal. Although local abolitionists quickly organized and petitioned the sheriff to release the two men, the slavecatchers had documents that described the men and claimed they were runaways. Evidence suggested the documents were false, but there was no way to refute the claim. The slavecatchers were allowed to take the two men as their prisoners, but before they left Indiana a group of abolitionists overtook the party and freed the two black laborers.Esarey, pp. 624–27. =State laws impacting African American migration= Indiana's state constitution prohibited slavery, but many Indiana residents supported legislation that prevented runaway slaves from entering the state. In 1851, when the Constitution of Indiana was revised, delegates to the constitutional convention considered granting voting rights to Indiana's free people of color. At that time, slave states were expelling free people of color and emancipated slaves in the hope that they would migrate to free states. Many residents of free states, including Indiana's citizens feared the impact of a rising population of free African Americans and wanted to keep these migrants out of the state. The majority of the convention delegates, hoping to ease tensions between the states and prevent further violence between the pro- slavery and anti-slavery factions, thought that the only appropriate solution was to include a clause in the state constitution that prohibited African Americans from immigrating to Indiana. The state's voters adopted Article XIII, Section 1, of the new constitution banning blacks and mulattos from entering the state; it remained in effect until the state constitution was amended in 1881.Constitution of Indiana, 1851, Article XIII, section 1: \\"No Negro or Mulatto shall come into, or settle in the state, after adoption of this Constitution.\\" See: Dunn, v. 1, pp. 466, 469, and 471–73. =Underground supporters= The slave catchers' aggressive tactics and the sight of runaways being returned to bondage in the South gradually impacted the state's population. By 1851, popular opinion was shifting from indifference to slavery toward increasingly antislavery sentiments. The result was more widespread involvement in the Underground Railroad and an increase in general support for hampering the slave catchers' efforts.Underground Railroad, United States National Park Service, p. 63. People of color, antislavery advocates, vigilance groups, abolitionists, and religious groups who opposed slavery were involved in the illegal network to help runaways.United States National Park Service, pp. 45, 59-61.Thornbrough, Indiana in the Civil War Era, 1850–1880, pp. 20–21. Although Indiana's free African American population was small (less than 1 percent of the state's overall population),Indiana's African American population between 1820 and 1860 increased nearly 800 percent (from 1,420 to 11,428), but still remained less than one percent of the total population. See Thornbrough, The Negro in Indiana Before 1900, pp. 44–45. most of the individuals who aided the fugitives along the state's southern border, especially at Madison, Indiana, were people of color. Some free blacks living in central and northern Indiana also aided runaways.Hanlon, p. 46. In addition to Indiana's free-black community and some abolitionists, other early supporters of the Underground Railroad were Quakers living the state's eastern counties.Dunn, v. 1, pp. 508–9.Thornbrough, Indiana in the Civil War Era, 1850–1880, p. 15. Not all abolitionists and members of antislavery groups approved of the underground network's radical activities, which were illegal, dangerous, and carried out in secrecy.United States National Park Service, p. 62. While many Quakers supported the Underground Railroad, some opposed these efforts, viewing them as extremist.United States National Park Service, p. 12. Other Indiana residents, even those who opposed slavery, disapproved of the secret network's illegal methods. Because of the consequences if they were caught (monetary fines, imprisonment, public harassment, etc.), unknown numbers of people living in Indiana participated in the Underground Railroad. In some Indiana communities, dozens were involved; in others, it may have only been a single person, but the Underground Railroad was not an organized nationwide network.United States National Park Service, pp. 11 and 46.Madison, p. 105. Membership in abolitionist groups or antislavery societies did not also mean they were Underground Railroad activists. For example, prominent Indiana abolitionist Stephen S. Harding, a lawyer in Ripley County, Indiana, who later became the territorial governor of Utah and chief justice of the Colorado Territory's Supreme Court in the 1860s, was outspoken in his views against slavery, but the alleged use of his home in Milan, Indiana, as a safehouse for fugitive slaves has not been confirmed.Dunn, v. 1, p. 513. See also: Also: Operation The Underground Railroad was an informal and illegal operation in the movement of fugitive slaves from the South to freedom in the North and in Canada. The effort, which continued until the end of the Civil War in 1865, involved individuals or groups who worked together in secrecy to give directions or provide food, clothing, shelter, and transportation to assist runaway slaves as they moved from one safe place to another to avoid capture. The underground network also incorporated railroad-related terms to refer to various aspects of this clandestine work such as routes, stations or depots (safe havens), conductors (guides), agents or stationmasters (property owners of the safehouses or their assistants), and passengers and cargoes (fugitives).Thornbrough, The Negro in Indiana Before 1900, p. 43. Escaped slaves, even after they reached Indiana, were still enslaved from a legal perspective and could be captured and returned to slavery.Thornbrough, The Negro in Indiana Before 1900, p. 39. In order to keep the fugitives safe, Underground Railroad members formed a loosely-organized network of stations (safe places to stay) around the state. Conductors and their associates provided food and shelter in barns, private homes, churches, and even caves and coal mines.Esary, p. 624.Thornbrough, The Negro in Indiana Before 1900, p. 41. Escaped slaves traveled in small groups, typically less than ten people, to stations at distances of to apart, the range that a small group could cover safely at night. In order to keep the runaways safe, and to protect the identities of those who provided aid, as few people as possible knew about the hiding places for runaways. Men were usually involved in transporting them from station to station, but women took fugitives into their homes, nursed the sick, and provided food, clothing, and shelter. Those active in the network are not all known by name and little is known of their secret activities. Conductors did not know all the stations or their associates along the routes. The participants' friends and neighbors may not have known of their involvement, or if they were suspicious, may have remained silent.Conklin, pp. 65 and 67. Routes The Erastus Farnham House (ca. 1849) south of Fremont, Indiana, just a few miles south of the Michigan border, was a final stop on the Underground Railroad in Indiana. Its cupola served as a lookout point and a cistern provided water without having to leave the house.Maurice McClew, \\"The Underground Railroad in Steuben County,\\" in Indiana was a likely place for runaways to escape because of its geographical location as a free state that bordered Kentucky, a slave state. Indiana's southern boundary, directly across the Ohio River from Kentucky, had several crossing points and various routes for runaways to follow north to reach Detroit, Michigan. From Michigan, fugitives could cross the Detroit River and find refuge in Ontario, Canada.Thornbrough, The Negro in Indiana Before 1900, p. 40.Underground Railroad, United States National Park Service, pp. 52 and 54. Most runaway slaves who entered Indiana followed one of three general routes after crossing the Ohio River. Southern Indiana communities such as Evansville, Rockport, New Albany, Jeffersonville, and Madison, as well as free black communities that included the Georgetown neighborhood of Madison in Jefferson County, Lick Creek in Orange County and Lyles Station in Gibson County, provided aid to runaways. A smaller number of fugitive slaves entered Indiana from Cincinnati, Ohio.Regan-Dinius, pp. 19 and 21.Thornbrough, The Negro in Indiana Before 1900, pp. 40–41. Due to the multiple entry points, Indiana's network of routes was complex, loosely organized, and intersected at various locations. Aid to the fugitives was sporadic and in some areas of Indiana the network was not active at all. Underground Railroad stations offering safe places to stay also changed over time to maintain secrecy and safety. If routes or stations became known to bounty hunters and slaveowners who ventured north to capture runaways, alternate sites could be used. Agents operating south of the Ohio River guided the runaways to safety in the North or give then instructions for finding help after crossing the river. A few people, including some employed by antislavery groups, quietly fished along the river waiting for fugitive slaves to arrive. On some occasions, Indiana agents of the Underground Railroad working with associates in Kentucky used visual signals such as bonfires before ferrying fugitives across the river. Small skiffs (boats) and private ferries hidden on the south shore of the river secretly transported the fugitives, usually at night. Agents of the underground network near the river also helped runaways slaves find their first hiding places in Indiana. Commercial ferries crossing the Ohio River also provided means for fugitives to escape from Kentucky to Indiana. Beginning in the 1850s and continuing into the 1860s, some fugitives boarded trains such as the New Albany-Salem Railroad traveling north to Indianapolis. At Underground Railroad stations (safe havens) the fugitive slaves were provided with meals, clothing, and shelter. The runaways remained in hiding until slavecatchers and bounty hunters in the area moved elsewhere or gave up their search. Escaped slaves often found refuge near Quaker communities and in rural African American communities as they traveled north.Thornbrough, The Negro in Indiana Before 1900, pp. 41 and 44.Underground Railroad, United States National Park Service, p. 68. Indiana's network was less organized than Ohio's routes. White abolitionists and free blacks worked together in Indiana, as well as separately. Routes beginning at New Albany and Madison had the most traffic. Escaping slaves continued their journey north from station to station, usually traveling on foot at night or hidden in wagons. Most escaped slaves eventually made it to northern Indiana, where they crossed the state's border into Michigan. Their final destination in the United States was usually Detroit, Michigan, or Toledo, Ohio, where boats could ferry them a short distance to Canada. Although runaway slaves were not officially granted asylum in Canada, extradition requests from U.S. authorities were rarely granted, allowing the fugitives to live the remainder of their lives in freedom.Dunn, v. 1, pp. 538 and 541.Hanlon, p. 43. Not all fugitive slaves passing through Indiana actually migrated to Canada. Indiana had several communities of free people of color and river towns with African American communities that helped to protect runaways and provide a safe place to live, or at least temporary shelter. Most of the African American settlements in Indiana's northern counties were established along an Underground Railroad route, where runaways could, and some actually did, become residents. For example, African American runaways John Rhodes (or Roads) and his wife, Rhuann Maria, along with their young child escaped in Missouri and passed through the Westfield, Indiana, area on their journey north. Instead of continuing, they decided to remain in the vicinity of nearby Deming. The family remained safe for several years until Singleton Vaughn arrived to claim them. The Rhodes family resisted capture and, with assistance from the local Quaker community and their neighbors, successfully escaped. Vaughn brought suit against those who provided aid to the fugitives (Vaughn v. William), which cost the group $600 in attorney's fees, but the family was not recaptured.United States National Park Service, pp. 70–73. =Eastern route= After secretly crossing the Ohio River on ferries from Trimble or Carroll Counties in Kentucky to either Cincinnati or Ripley, Ohio, runaway slaves following the eastern route typically came through Madison, a major center for the Underground Railroad in Indiana. From Madison, the eastern rout went north to stations along the Indiana-Ohio border, including Newport in Wayne County, Indiana, where Levi Coffin, one of the primary organizers of the network lived for some time. A branch of the eastern route passed into Ohio, but the main route continued north from Newport through Winchester, Portland, Decatur, Fort Wayne, and Auburn, Indiana, before continuing into Michigan. Quaker families in settlements known for their antislavery activity in Wayne, Randolph and Henry Counties also provided aid to fugitives. Another branch from southeast Indiana went through Columbus, Indiana, a point of convergence with the central Indiana route.Thornbrough, The Negro in Indiana Before 1900, pp. 40–41, 43. Agents near Madison, Indiana In Madison, Indiana, the free black community was especially active in the Underground Railroad from 1836 until 1846, when a race riot in Madison made it unsafe for its free black leaders to remain there. Chapman Harris, a free African American, was a member of the underground network by the 1830s. His family's cabin, about from Madison, was a safe house for fugitives who crossed the Ohio River. Harris's associate, Elijah Anderson, a free-born African American whose cabin was also a station, helped ferry fugitives across the river. Anderson came to Madison in 1837 and guided as many as 800 fugitives before he was eventually arrested and convicted in Kentucky for his efforts. Anderson served four years of an eight-year sentence at the state penitentiary at Frankfort, Kentucky, before his death in 1861.Thornbrough, The Negro in Indiana Before 1900, pp. 41–42. George DeBaptiste a free black who moved to Madison in 1838, was a barber and businessman, as well as a conductor on the Underground Railroad. DeBaptiste crossed the river into Kentucky to guide runaways and is believed to have helped more than 300 fugitive slaves. His barbershop in Madison was a center of Underground Railroad activity along the eastern route in the 1830s and 1840sbut due to his active involvement in the underground network, it became unsafe for DeBaptiste to remain in Madison. He moved to Detroit, Michigan, around 1846.Thornbrough, The Negro in Indiana Before 1900, p. 42, note 14. Other African American agents of the underground network in Madison included John Lott, Henry Thornton, and Griffith Booth, among others. Lott worked with Harris to organize the free blacks in the area; Thornton later served in the Union army during the Civil War before his death in 1892; and Booth later moved to Kalamazoo, Michigan.Coon, pp. 39–46. Eleutherian College Antislavery whites in the Madison area were also involved in aiding fugitive slaves. The Neil's Creek Anti-Slavery Society in rural Jefferson County, Indiana, for example, had more than eighty families involved in support of the Underground Railroad near Eleutherian College. Area leaders included the families of Lyman Hoyt, Benajah Hoyt, James Tibbetts, and John Hays, among others. More than nine of society members' homes were used as safe houses for the underground network.Coon, pp. 51–54. Farther north, Arvine C. Quier, an Ohio native who moved to Indiana in 1852, was among the conductors who assisted fugitive slaves escape through Jennings County, Indiana, a stopover for runaways journeying north from Madison, and others following the central route from the New Albany, Indiana, area. Quier owned a sawmill near Butlerville, and his wife, Mary (Michener) Quier, cared for fugitive slaves in their home before he transported them to the next station.Hanlon, pp. 45–46. Newport, Indiana, agents Quaker abolitionist Levi Coffin Levi Coffin, a Quaker and one of the most famous abolitionists in Indiana, operated a station out of his rural home at Newport (present-day Fountain City). Coffin, who is sometimes referred to as the president of the Underground Railroad, made no secret of his activities as an Underground Railroad conductor, although many of his fellow Quakers thought his actions too radical. The Levi and Catherine Coffin home at Newport has been called the \\"Grand Central Station of the Underground Railroad\\" along the route between Cincinnati, Ohio, and Canada. Between 1826 and 1846, more than 2,000 escaped slaves reportedly stopped there for aid. Among the fugitives that the Coffins assisted was William Bush, who remained in Newport and became a blacksmith, as well as an Underground Railroad conductor.The Coffins were the inspiration for Harriet Beecher Stowe's fictional characters of Simeon and Rachel Halliday in her book, Uncle Tom's Cabin, which tells the story of a runaway named Eliza Harris who escaped to Canada, beyond the reach of the slave catchers, and lived the remainder of her life in freedom. The fictional character of Eliza is reportedly based, in part, on a real-life fugitive who crossed the Ohio River to Ripley County, Ohio, with the aid of Newport resident Reverend William Lacey. Closely pursued by slave catchers, the runaway was taken to Newport, Indiana, where she stayed at the Coffin home. Catherine Coffin named her Eliza. Years later, Catherine Coffin was reunited with the former fugitive during a visit to Canada. See: Also: Dunn, p. 508, and Blockson, pp. 229 and 231. In addition to Bush, several also African American men in the Newport area, including \\"William Davidson, Douglas White, James Benson, and Cal Thomas\\" assisted runaway slaves reach safety in the north. At Newport, about north of Richmond, in Wayne County, Indiana, other area residents provided aid to fugitive slaves, most of them anonymously.Waldrip, pp. 64–65. Newport Quakers and free-black communities in the area worked together as well as separately in their efforts. Informers in the Newport area were made to feel unwelcome, and most, but not all moved elsewhere. Local women in Newport formed a sewing group to assemble clothing for the runaways and raised funds to purchase what was needed by selling some of their handmade goods. When bounty hunters or slave owners were not pursuing them, some escaped slaves found work in Newport among the community's free black residents. At Cabin Creek, a free-black community near Newport, runaways stayed in the home of John Bond and other homes scattered in the area. Spartanburg was another free black community in the area that provided aid. Spartanburg resident Lewis Talbert made multiple trips to the South to guide runaways to freedom. Although he was captured and escaped, it not known how long he survived.Waldrip, pp. 69–71 and 76. =Central routes= After crossing the Ohio River from major crossing points in the Louisville, Kentucky, area, the central Indiana route began at New Albany, Jeffersonville, and Clarksville, or possibly at Madison or the vicinity of Leavenworth, Indiana. From these arrival points, the route continued to Corydon and Columbus, Indiana. Some fugitives, after crossing the river into Indiana, went to an African American settlement known as Greenbrier, near Hanover, Indiana, before moving to stations in Jennings and Decatur Counties.Thornbrough, The Negro in Indiana Before 1900, pp. 42–43. Branches of the central route converged near Columbus and continued north to Indianapolis, Westfield, Logansport, Plymouth, and South Bend, Indiana, before passing into Michigan. Others active in the movement in central Indiana included several members of the Westfield, a community founded by Quakers in Hamilton County, as well as others from nearby Deming. Westfield also became a key station of the Underground Railroad in central Indiana as a point where several routes converged. Men and women of Westfield and Deming offered places in their homes and barns for shelter, cared for the sick, and provided food, clothing, and other supplies for fugitive slaves.Conklin, pp. 67–68. At New Albany, Indiana, runaway slaves moved on to Salem and Bloomington before continuing north. Free blacks at Graysville in Jefferson County, especially George Evans, the African American stationmaster at Greenbrier, as well as other free blacks living in smaller communities near South Hanover and Kent provided aid and assistance to the fugitives moving to stations in Jennings and Decatur Counties. Free blacks also managed routes beginning at Jeffersonville, Indiana. African American agents operating in Rush County, Indiana, included Clarksburg resident Miles Meadows and Jim Hunt of Carthage; however, most of the agents in central Indiana were white men. White antislavery agents reportedly working in the Corydon area included Bill Crawford, John Rankin, and Zack Pennington.Gresham, v. 1, pp. 32-33. Not all agents along the central route were successful in their efforts. Corydon resident Oswald Wright was arrested for aiding fugitive slaves in Harrison County, Indiana, during their escape from Kentucky. Wright was sentenced to five years in prison at the Frankfort (Kentucky) penitentiary and returned to Corydon after serving his sentence. =Western routes= Anti-Slavery League agents in western Indiana had boatmen ferry fugitives across the Ohio River from various points in Kentucky. These routes through Indiana began at Evansville, a river town in Vanderburgh County, or at crossings in Posey, Warrick, or Spencer Counties. The western routes continued north along the Wabash River, or through Gibson and Pike counties, toward Terre Haute in Vigo County and onward to Lafayette in Tippecanoe County. Routes from Evansville north to Princeton in Gibson County, Indiana, were not as frequently used as routes between Oakland City also in Gibson County, and Petersburg in Pike County.Mills, \\"Report to Indiana Department of National Resources,\\" pp. 23–24. A free black community at Evansville often provided aid for fugitives seeking refuge. Other free African American communities in western Indiana who assisted the fugitives included Lyles Station in Gibson County and Lost Creek in Vigo County.Lu, Davis, and Davis, p. ii. Thomas Cole, a free black from Lyles Station, about west of Princeton, used his farm as an Underground Railroad station.Mills, \\"Report to Indiana Department of National Resources,\\" pp. 33. African American Ben Swain was the principal agent at Rockport, Indiana. Farther north in Parke County, Rueben Lawhorn, a free-born African American, was a part of the underground network, but others working along the western routes are unknown.Thornbrough, The Negro in Indiana Before 1900, pp. 43–44. From Princeton, Indiana, fugitive slaves moved north to Bloomingdale in Parke County and onward to Michigan City in LaPorte County before crossing the Indiana-Michigan border. Other routes from Indiana led to Toledo, Ohio, a short distance to Canada. Arrivals from Rockport in Spencer County, Indiana, journeyed to Petersburg, where they hid in coal mines and coal banks before continuing north to Mooresville or Morgantown in Morgan County, Indiana, and Noblesville in Hamilton County, Indiana. Warrick County farmer Ira Caswell (1814–1878), a secret member of the Executive Committee of the Anti-Slavery Society, was an outspoken abolitionist. He was also an active conductor on the Underground Railroad. His land north of Boonville was considered the first stop for runaways entering in Warrick County, Indiana, after crossing the Ohio River. The next stops in the area toward Daviess and Greene Counties were James Cockrum's barn cellar at Oakland City and Doctor John W. Posey's coal bank outside Petersburg. (Posey, a Petersburg physician and abolitionist, was owner of Blackburn Mine, a coal mine near Petersburg.)Mills, \\"Report to Indiana Department of National Resources,\\" pp. 6–15, 24. In Gibson County, David Stormont (1802–1886), a member of the Reformed Presbyterian Church, and his wife provided runaways with food and clothing. They also hid runaways in their Gibson County home and at a log cabin on their property about northwest of Princeton. Other Gibson County residents provided aid and shelter, including John Carithers, an antislavery supporter and member of the local Reformed Presbyterian Church, and Charles Grier.Mills, \\"Report to Indiana Department of National Resources,\\" pp. 29–32. The underground network in west central Indiana, as in other areas of the state, was loosely organized. At the Bethel settlement, a Quaker community in Fountain County, cabins in the swamplands, area homesteads, and Bethel Church (affiliated with the Methodist Episcopal Church) were used as safehouses. Some fugitives remained in the community, living among the free blacks, but most escaped slaves moved north toward Canada. At Crawfordsville in nearby Montgomery County, the home of stonemason John Allen Speed, who later became the second mayor of the city, and his wife, Margaret, was used as a safehouse along the route to Lafayette.Lu, Davis, and Davis, pp. 9, 52–54, and 60–61. Reprisals Some Quakers, but not all, opposed the radical activities of the Underground Railroad. Before abolitionism increased in popularity, some Quaker communities ostracized members who chose to participate in the underground network, but later discontinued the practice. Other Quakers formed separate congregations. In 1843, for example, a faction of the Society of Friends split to form the Yearly Meeting of the Anti-Slavery Friends.Gara, pp. 79–80.Conklin, p. 67. Enforcement of fugitive slave laws and fear of being captured by bounty hunters and their deputies caused many African Americans, especially those living along Indiana's southern boundary, to move elsewhere. In some of African-American communities, locals were harsh in their treatment of informants who identified the whereabouts of hidden fugitives to collect rewards. Several abolitionists in Indiana were the targets of violence for their participation in the Underground Railroad and helping runaway slaves escape capture. For example, Seth Concklin, a native of New York, ferried fugitive slaves from Alabama along the Tennessee River and Ohio River to reach the Wabash River near New Harmony, Indiana. Concklin volunteered his assistance, intending to reunite enslaved members of the Sill family with their free relatives in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. After leaving the fugitives at a while he made arrangement to continue their journey, the family was captured and taken in a wagon toward Vincennes. Concklin tried unsuccessfully to free them, but he was captured himself and placed in chains. Concklin's antislavery friends moved quickly to get him released, but they were unsuccessful. The slavecatchers left Indiana aboard a steamboat with Concklin and the fugitive slaves. During the trip south, Conckln went missing from the steamboat. His body, still in chains, was retrieved from the river and his skull was crushed. Most thought it was the result of his fall in an attempted escape or possible suicide; however, antislavery supporters believed he had been murdered.Dunn, pp. 521–22. Calvin Fairbank In another incident, Kentucky marshals abducted Calvin Fairbank, who aided a mulatto woman named Tamar by bringing her from Louisville, Kentucky, across the Ohio River to Indiana. Fairbank was captured at Jeffersonville, Indiana, while returning to Kentucky on November 9, 1851. Following his trial in Kentucky, Fairbank was convicted and sentenced to fifteen years in prison. Fairbank served twelve years before John J. Crittenden, the governor of Kentucky, pardoned him in 1864.The 1851 incident was Fairbank's second conviction for aiding runaways. The first occurred in 1844, when he was arrested for aiding Lewis Hayden and his family's in their escape from Kentucky to Ohio. Fairbank served a total of sixteen years for his involvement in the underground network. See: Underground Railroad, National Park Service, p. 63. Effects on Indiana The Underground Railroad helped change Hoosier opinions about slavery. In the decades prior to the Civil War, Indiana's abolitionists, antislavery supporters, and free people of color remained staunchly opposed to slavery, but the majority of Indiana residents were indifferent to the issue. Many Hoosiers, especially those in the southern part of the state who had migrated to Indiana from slave states in the South, had a more tolerant attitude toward slavery. Popular opinion regarding the plight of escaping slaves eventually shifted, especially after witnessing bounty hunters and slavecatchers forcibly taking runaways and, in some cases, free people of color into bondage. By the late 1850s and early 1860s, public attitudes in Indiana had swung firmly against the continuation of slavery in the United States.Esarey, p. 628. In 1998, the National Park Service initiated efforts to encourage further research regarding the Underground Railroad and establishing the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program. State organizations such as the Indiana Division of Historic Preservation and Archaeology subsequently established initiatives of their own. The Indiana Department of National Resources continues to sponsor an Indiana Freedom Trails History Marker Program. The Indiana Freedom Trails, Inc., a nonprofit organization, was established in 1998 to support research and educational efforts related to Indiana sites and routes that were part of the underground network. In addition, state historical markers have been placed at sites linked to the Underground Railroad in Indiana, as well as other related topics.

Heller (1891–1969) was a US financier and philanthropist, who founded Walter E. Heller and Company, Inc., Chicago, Illinois with money borrowed from his father in 1919. He originally started the company to do \\"automobile financing\\" as autos became more popular in the 1920s. The firm developed into a highly successful, multi-faceted international financial company that was a leader in various fields of finance, particularly in factoring.  Heller Financial  Walter E. Heller and Co., Inc. was a finance company involved in leasing, factoring, asset-based commercial lending, commercial real estate lending and owned manufacturing companies located throughout the United States and abroad. The company was also involved with commercial real estate development and construction. The manufacturing subsidiaries were subsequently sold off, as required by U.S. anti-trust bank ownership laws, when the company purchased American National Corporation in Chicago, the holding company for American National Bank and Trust Company, in 1973 for $108.8 million. Alternate Link via ProQuest. Ten years later, Walter E. Heller International Corporation sold American National Corporation to First Chicago Corporation for $275 million. Walter E. Heller International was purchased in 1985 by Fuji Bank and was renamed Heller Financial when new leadership was brought in to change the focus after U.S. banks began competing directly with commercial finance companies and business lending institutions. Heller Financial began trading on the Chicago Stock Exchange on May 8, 1998. At that time, it was one of the largest initial public offerings on record. Subsequently, Heller Financial was purchased by GE Capital during the early 2000s.  Factoring  Heller was a pioneer of the use of factoring and developed it into a more sophisticated form of finance of company business accounts receivable, thus providing capital for businesses to grow by giving them cash to expand the business cycle by purchasing an account receivable at a discount, with or without recourse to the seller. Then, by owning it, he would collect the balance of the receivable in full. The profit was derived by the amount of discount collected by the factor. As the factoring business expanded, it was done in bulk with contractually obligated clients selling their receivables by assignment to the factoring company. Advances against these receivables purchased were made and the client paid a fee to the factor. As American businesses became more sophisticated and manufacturing became more prominent after World War II, certain industries primary used factoring as a form of business finance and credit insurance on the credit risk of its customers. These industries were primarily involved with the manufacturing of textiles and carpeting, although other businesses used this type of financing model for their own credit needs. Capital for businesses was not then available from banks because the banks felt business loans were too risky.  Personal  Heller married Florence Grunsfeld Heller (1897–1966) in Chicago on February 22, 1917. They had three children, John Andrew, Peter Eugene, and Paul Walter. They were divorced in 1953. He later married Alyce DeCosta. The Roosevelt University business school is named after him while Brandeis University's Heller School for Social Policy is named after his wife, Florence. Several Chicago-area parks bear his name, as well as the Walter E. Heller Foundation, a philanthropic supporter of PBS.

It was published in the 1921 collection The Triumph of the Egg. Plot summary The story takes place in the fictional town of Huntersburg, Illinois, in June 1908. After learning from her father, Doctor Lester Cochran, on the evening before that he is suffering from a heart disease and might die at any moment, 18-year-old Mary Cochran takes a walk around the small town, thinking about her future. Her father had told her that he would be leaving her only very little money after he dies, suggesting her to \\"make plans for the future\\". He says this in a cold and toneless way, as he has never shown any real affection or warmth. Being fascinated by the atmosphere, she walks through the new factory district where the workers of the new furniture industry live, finally reaching a decayed orchard of an abandoned farm, a place she frequently visits to hide out and be alone. She thinks about her dreams to move to Chicago one day, as she feels uncomfortable with the small-town gossip around her mother leaving town with another man when she was a baby. She is disturbed in her reflections when Duke Yetter, a young man, appears after following her which makes her angry. Running away to evade him, she reaches the other end of town, where she is surprised and delighted when a man praises her father who had healed one of his sons and helped the whole family, making her feel a \\"great new love\\" for her father. Meanwhile, her father sits at home and remembers his wife who had come to town as an actor many years ago, until she left because she could no longer bear the small-town life and the cold man whom she married. The doctor mourns of never having expressed his emotion and love for his wife to her—or his daughter. \\"I told myself she should have understood without words and I've all my life been telling myself the same thing about Mary. I've been a fool and a coward. I've always been silent because I've been afraid of expressing myself – like a blundering fool. I've been a proud man and a coward. tonight I'll do it. If it kills me, I'll make myself talk to the girl.\\" A farmer appears at his house and they ride out to the farm because the farmer's wife is bearing a child. On the way back home, he makes plans to talk to his daughter about \\"the whole story of his marriage and its failure sparing himself no humiliation.\\" When he finally gets back home, where Mary is waiting for him, he dies of a heart attack.

They play their matches at The Haughs, beside the River Deveron in Turriff, Aberdeenshire. They joined the Highland League for the 2009–10 season, having been accepted into the league on 25 February 2009.Turriff United, Formartine and Strathspey in pressandjournal.co.uk, 26 February 2009 Prior to joining the Highland League, they were a Scottish Junior Football Association club, playing in the Scottish Junior Football North Premier League. Turriff finished in the top half of the table only once in their first five seasons in the Highland League, but their fortunes improved significantly in the 2014–15 season. The club recovered from early-season setbacks (their heaviest-ever league defeat, 8–0 by defending champions Brora Rangers, followed by a three-point penalty for fielding an ineligible player in their opening match) to beat their previous record of 16 wins in a season with 14 matches still to play. Turriff went on to compile a 23-match unbeaten run, during which they briefly led the league table following a 1–0 win over Deveronvale on 3 January 2015, and again following a 3–0 victory over Huntly four weeks later. On both occasions the second-placed club, Brora Rangers, had two games in hand. Turriff remained Brora's closest rivals for the rest of the season, until Brora finally took the title with a 2–1 win over Turriff at The Haughs on 28 March. A week later, Turriff secured second place when a draw between their own closest rivals, Cove Rangers and Wick Academy, left both clubs unable to close the gap. The club made its Scottish Cup debut in 2012, beating Burntisland Shipyard, Civil Service Strollers and Buckie Thistle to reach the fourth round, in which a 1–1 draw at home to Greenock Morton made them the last surviving non-SFL/SPL side in the competition, before being knocked out in the replay. In 2013–14, Turriff reached the third round, beating Selkirk and Wick Academy before going out to Stirling Albion. In 2014–15 they beat Lossiemouth in the first round, before losing to Clyde in the second. By virtue of finishing as runners up in the Highland League, they entered the 2015–16 competition in the second round, before losing to Fraserburgh. Changes to the entry criteria of the Scottish Challenge Cup allowed Turriff to take part for the first time in 2016-17. They reached the third round, losing to Hibernian. The game set a new home attendance record for Turriff (1,791) and was their first match to be televised live (on BBC Alba). Turriff's most consistent success as a senior club has been in the Aberdeenshire Shield competition, which they have won three times. During the 2013–14 competition, their semi-final match against Cove Rangers was declared void and ordered to be replayed after it emerged that both teams had fielded ineligible players (in Turriff's case, the player was an unused substitute). The decision was to Turriff's advantage, as they had lost the original match - but went on to win the replay and so reach the final for the second year running. In 2015, they again beat Cove Rangers in the semi-final to become finalists three years in a row. The club's official mascot is Moo the Coo, an anthropomorphised male counterpart to the town's unofficial emblem, the Turra Coo. The Haughs The Haughs () is the club's home ground and is located by the River Deveron near the centre of Turriff. The Haughs hosted the decisive match in the 2014–15 Highland Football League season, Brora Rangers being declared champions after beating Turriff, their closest rivals 2–1.

OS Explorer Map 228 – March & Ely. The village is west of Norwich, south-south-west of King's Lynn and north of London. The nearest town is Wisbech which is west-south-west of the village. The village lies to the south of the route of the A47County A to Z Atlas, Street & Road maps Norfolk, page 230 between Peterborough and Kings Lynn. The parish of Tilney St Lawrence in the 2001 census, has a population of 1,465, increasing to 1,576 at the 2011 Census. For the purposes of local government, the parish falls within the district of King's Lynn and West Norfolk. Description Tilney St Lawrence is located within a large parish of the same name, situated in the West Norfolk Local Government District. The parish has an area of . The parish also contains the villages of Tilney St Lawrence, Tilney cum Islington and Islington. The parish that exists today used to be two separate parishes. They were Tilney St Lawrence and Tilney-cum-Islington which were combined in 1935 to form the fourth largest parish in the Marshland region. The name Tilney is thought to derive from the Old English for Tibba's homestead,A Popular Guide to Norfolk Place-names: by James Rye: Published by Larks press, Dereham, Norfolk, 2000 ; and St Lawrence refers to the dedication of the village parish church. The name Islington is thought to derive from the Old English for enclosure of Elesa's people. HistoryThe Roman period= At one time it is thought that there were two Roman waterways that ran to a junction within the parish. The Aylmer CanalThe Fenland Project Number 9 by M Waller (1994): Flandrian Environmental Change in Fenland (Cambridge, Cambridgeshire Archaeological Committee) was constructed between 43 AD and 409 AD and was used for transport and communication through the local area. The environment around the canal during the Roman period of occupation is uncertain, but it may have been waterlogged silts or peat lands. It is thought that the canal was partially washed away by a sea inundation during the 2nd or 3rd century. The Spice Hills Canal, built around the same period, ran along a south-west, north-east line and appears to approach and almost certainly join the Aylmer canal. Today the canals appear visible as an earthworks on aerial photographs. =Medieval= The ruined church of St Mary's Islington The village of Tilney St Lawrence did not exist in its own right at the time of the Domesday Book although the settlement of Islington, which lies in the very northeast corner of this parish, is listed. Today very little is left of the settlement of Islington,The Domesday Book, Englands Heritage, Then and Now, Editor: Thomas Hinde,Norfolk page 191, Islington, which is thought to have been a populous and a valuable Late Saxon settlement, with a number of salt houses and a church. This church is likely to have been the present day St Mary's Church, which lies redundant and largely ruined. By the late 13th century, Tilney St Lawrence had overtaken Islington as the main settlement within the parish and had a church dedicated to St Lawrence. Governance Tilney St Lawrence is part of the electoral ward called St Lawrence. The population of this ward at the 2011 census was 2,467.

There is also a small proportion of the original screen remaining. Notable peopleJohn Aylmer= John Aylmer, Bishop of London John Aylmer was born in the village at Aylmer Hall in 1521. He was a great friend of Henry Grey, 1st Duke of Suffolk, Marquis of Dorset who sent him to study at Cambridge where he became a fellow of Queens' College. Grey made him his chaplain and tutor to his daughter Lady Jane Grey. This exceptionally gifted girl told Roger Ascham that her achievements were due to Mr Aylmer, who teaches me so gently, so pleasantly, and with such fair allurements to learning that I think all the time nothing while I am with him. It appears that this gentle and encouraging tutor became, as bishop of London from 1577 until his death in 1594, increasingly unpopular because of his arbitrary and unconciliatory disposition. His work, particularly his characterisation of England as a mixed monarchy, would be important to later English constitutionalists.

The western terminus of US 80 was in San Diego, California, and it continued east through the city on several different alignments through the years. The highway went through the Cuyamaca Mountains, encountering many switchbacks, before descending to El Centro. After passing through the sand dunes, the highway crossed the Colorado River into Yuma, Arizona. The highway replaced a 1912 plank road across much of Imperial County. The winding two-lane road through the Cuyamaca Mountains was one of the factors that led to a four-hour journey from San Diego to El Centro. During the 1930s, the road was realigned through the mountains, but several curves remained. In the 1950s, work began on constructing what would become Interstate 8 (I-8) to replace the old highway in San Diego to bypass the cities of San Diego, La Mesa, and El Cajon. This started with the construction of the Alvarado Canyon road as well as Mission Valley Road through the San Diego area, as well as construction of a replacement for the old highway across the Viejas Grade. The construction continued across the rest of the route through the next two decades. US 80 was gradually decommissioned after 1964 as I-8, through San Diego and Imperial counties, was completed. In 2006, the highway was designated by the California State Legislature as Historic U.S. Route 80\\\\. Route description There were multiple alignments through the downtown San Diego area. The route as of 1928 began at Broadway (US 101) and ran along 4th Avenue north to University Avenue in the Hillcrest district, then went east on University Avenue. By 1933, the routing had shifted to use Park Boulevard south of University Avenue into downtown, to end at Market Street; the city council voted that July to use University Avenue west of Park Boulevard to connect to US 101, to obtain federal funding for improving that road. The next year, the Point Loma highway was referred to as the western terminus of US 80 by E.E. Wallace, a district highway engineer. Nevertheless, the state-produced highway maps from the next few years did not reflect the change, or this choice of the western terminus. In the early days of World War II, some maps showed the western terminus of US 80 at the Cabrillo National Monument on Point Loma, running north on Catalina Boulevard, north then east on Cañon Street, northeast on Rosecrans Street, southeast on Lytton Street, east on Barnett Avenue, south on Pacific Highway (US 101) and finally east on Market Street, before continuing north along Park Boulevard to El Cajon Boulevard. US 395 ran concurrently along the route from downtown San Diego to the intersection with Fairmount Avenue. By 1942, the US 395 concurrency had been removed. With the completion of the Cabrillo Freeway, between 1946 and 1948, US 80 shifted from Park Boulevard to 11th Avenue north onto the new freeway before continuing east onto El Cajon Boulevard towards La Mesa. The final San Diego alignment, with signs to be placed in 1954, moved the western terminus to the intersection with US 101 where it traveled east on what was known as Camino del Rio and Alvarado Canyon Road, and then continuing on the Mission Valley road towards La Mesa. According to Caltrans district engineer Jacob Dekema, during the 1950s, the parts of Camino del Rio and Rosecrans Street from Lytton Street and Rosecrans Street to Pacific Highway were considered a part of US 80. Descanso Junction East of San Diego, US 80 followed the path of El Cajon Boulevard through La Mesa and then onto Main Street near downtown El Cajon before heading towards the Mountain Springs grade. The route was realigned from Arnold Way onto Alpine Boulevard as it passed through Alpine and the Viejas Indian Reservation, before entering the Laguna Mountains and the Cleveland National Forest on the alignment used by I-8. At Laguna Junction, a cafe for travelers existed from 1916 until it was removed to provide land for the interchange with I-8. A section of old US 80 — with the first few miles signed as SR 79 — continues to serve as access to the communities of Descanso, Guatay and Pine Valley; SR 79 intersected US 80 east of Descanso. At the time, the Ellis Wayside Rest/Ellis Spring provided a rest area and water for travelers; later, the state recognized it as a historic site. Exiting the national forest, US 80 continued in a southeasterly direction towards Live Oak Springs and Boulevard, intersecting with the eastern terminus of SR 94\\\\. US 80 then came close to the Mexican border as it curved around the Jacumba Mountains and into the hot spring town of Jacumba. East of there, US 80 passed by the Desert View Tower. US 80 then descended rapidly into Imperial County along the In-Ko-Pah Gorge just west of Coyote Wells and Ocotillo before entering the city limits of El Centro. East of El Centro, US 80 again continued into Holtville. US 80 cut a southeasterly trajectory, running parallel and very close to the Mexican border, and traversing the Algodones Dunes and the Colorado Desert. It finally reached Winterhaven before crossing the Colorado River into Yuma, Arizona. Almost the entire length of the former US 80 within Imperial County has since been designated County Route S80. History thumb =Construction= Route 12 was added to the state highway system in 1909 from San Diego to El Centro, and Route 27 was added from El Centro to Yuma in 1915. Before a highway was constructed through the Imperial San Dunes, travelers had to pass to the north in order to reach Yuma. The first route through Imperial Valley was originally a plank road made of pieces of wood that were tied together. The road was completed by October 1912, and portions were still visible into the 2010s. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915, and a new plank road was opened that year which became state-maintained in 1917, and used a foundation of wooden rails, with the planks bound together by steel, as opposed to simple planks that were fastened to rails. However, traffic congestion and dusty conditions made travel along the plank road difficult. The delay in constructing a road to San Diego caused increased development in Los Angeles and resulted in that city becoming the trade and population center of Southern California. A stagecoach road existed into the 19th century that passed through the mountains east of San Diego. Construction was discussed as early as 1911, with The San Diego Union and Daily Bee saying that it \\"will be one of the best in the system.\\" Well before the freeway was constructed, the automobile road through the mountains east of San Diego was narrow and wound through the mountains; it was officially dedicated in 1912. This trip was known to take up to four hours, and frequently resulted in the radiator boiling over, flat tires, or broken fan belts; recent inclement weather would result in cars becoming mired in the mud. But meanwhile, Colonel Ed Fletcher declared the road a \\"success\\", and indicated his belief that a concrete road from San Diego to Yuma would soon follow, responding to criticism that a road from Los Angeles to Brawley should have been built. US 80 was designated on November 11, 1926, along with the rest of the U.S. Routes. The asphalt road was constructed through the valley as the main east–west route, and was open by 1927. Another road was constructed in the early 1930s, to remove curves and widen the lanes. The result was a two-lane road that still had many switchbacks, with one popularly known as \\"Dead Man's Curve\\". Planning for this new alignment was underway in 1932, and much of the work was to be located at the Viejas Grade, and at the segment just west of Alpine. Paving continued on US 80 into 1934, just west of the sand dunes. Meanwhile, Imperial County businessmen hoped to promote the use of this road over the route from Phoenix to Los Angeles, to increase tourism. Eventually, US 80 did become the most used road into Southern California from the east, but by 1947, the Highway 80 Associated was formed to increase the traffic on the road, since the war and advertising by other cities had caused it to fall again. Four years later, US 80 was reported to be the most used transcontinental highway, and there was a 40 percent increase in the out-of-state cars that traveled through the state inspection station at Yuma during the first three months of that year. But in 1954, there were reports that traffic had decreased, because the road to Phoenix, Arizona from Lordsburg, New Mexico had improved. =Early freeway development= The abandoned alignment of US 80 across the In-Ko-Pah Gorge Starting in 1932, county and state officials proposed rerouting US 80 away from what is now La Mesa Boulevard. Although the city raised concerns about the proposal, due to the shift in transportation design towards \\"free-access highways\\" where vehicles could travel up to , and the success of the Arroyo Seco Parkway in Los Angeles, the La Mesa Scout newspaper withdrew their objections to the construction. In the meantime, parts of El Cajon Boulevard through downtown El Cajon were widened in 1935. Federal funds were allocated for rerouting US 80 in 1940; by then, La Mesa Boulevard had been designated as a U.S. 80 Business Route, and El Cajon Boulevard then carried the US 80 designation to San Diego. But in 1947, the San Diego Highway Development Association criticized the proliferation of traffic signals and businesses on El Cajon Boulevard, during the discussion of how to resolve traffic issues on US 101 through Oceanside. World War II stalled most freeway projects in the San Diego area. Plans were developed by 1946 for a freeway through Alvarado Canyon that would connect with the Cabrillo Freeway. Funding was obtained by 1949 for the portion between 70th Street and Lake Murray Boulevard, and Fairmout Avenue. The first portion of the Alvarado Canyon Highway, the first freeway thorough La Mesa, was opened in early 1950. Reports indicated that this decreased the time to travel from La Mesa to San Diego by a factor of two, with 7,000 trips on the route each day. That same year, the San Diego city manager expressed concerns at the Highway Commission meeting about shifting US 80 away from El Cajon Boulevard to the Alvarado Canyon and Mission Valley Road route, due to the potential loss of commerce for businesses located near the current route. In 1948, the Highway 80 Chamber of Commerce president complained that funds were being prioritized for US 395 construction, instead of on US 80. In September, the county supervisors approved the Mission Valley road as a limited access highway, but held off on processing the results from surveying. The next month, $1 million was allocated to the realignment of the Viejas grade, namely, increasing the radius of the curves from to , as well as limiting the grade to 4 percent. By 1949, the project was under way, with prisoners contributing to the labor force, and was projected to include a tunnel as well as several crossings of the Sweetwater River. A longer tunnel through the Cuyamaca Mountains was also proposed that year, which would have been the longest in the world. But by 1950, work on the Viejas grade had stalled, due to the prison labor camp being shut down; efforts were then made to start work again. More funds were allocated by the State Highway Commission a few months later, and the work was to be put out for bid to complete the project. Meanwhile, construction continued on the western part of the US 80 freeway. On August 27, 1951, the final link in the new freeway between Point Loma and La Mesa was dedicated. The next year, planning continued for the possibility of a freeway bypass of El Cajon that would connect to the existing US 80 freeway. However, many El Cajon Boulevard motel owners raised objections over the reassigning of the US 80 designation to the new freeway, as it would potentially harm business. In response, the Highway Development Association proposed designating El Cajon Boulevard as a business route. But in order to obtain funding for the construction, the new route would have to be added to the state highway system by the California State Legislature, or be designated as US 80. Later, a Freeway 80 Association was formed to encourage public support for the construction of the bypass of El Cajon, and the conversion of the Alvarado Canyon and Mission Valley roads into a freeway. Following the city of San Diego council and county approval, the California State Assembly transportation committee heard complaints from citizens claiming that they had not been adequately notified about the plans for US 80 or SR 94, or given enough time to provide input. In Imperial County, discussion regarding rerouting US 80 south of the city of Holtville began in August 1953. The next year, the state director of public works announced that the route would be rebuilt to the south for as a freeway. In February 1954, the California Highway Commission declared that both the Alvarado Canyon and Mission Valley roads, as well as the new Holtville alignment, were to be part of US 80; an alignment was also chosen for the part of the highway that passed through El Cajon. A $934,211 contract was given out to construct the Holtville portion in April. Contrary to the recommendation of the California Senate Interim Committee on Highways to study constructing the freeway to replace US 80 on a new alignment, San Diego County officials decided to pursue upgrading the existing road to become a freeway. Another route through the Lyons Valley was considered as an alternative. The Highway Development Association proposed adding grade-separated interchanges on the routing of US 80 through San Diego, as well as reconstructing the interchange with the Cabrillo Freeway, as well as finishing the work on the Viejas Grade and through the mountains. That year, according to Caltrans, the interchange with US 395 was the busiest in the county. =Interstate Highway System= In April 1955, a Caltrans official announced that US 80 would be built as a freeway for its entire length in California, as it was to be included in the Interstate Highway System. In the meantime, while plans moved further along on US 101, San Diego Mayor John D. Butler asked the California Highway Commission to keep the US 80 project on track. However, the construction was put on hold because of lower traffic levels on US 80, compared to other local highways. State Assemblyman Sheridan N. Hegland raised the issue in the Assembly Highway subcommittee in December, stating that the construction of the freeway would help the economy and the Port of San Diego. State Senator Randolph Collier went even further and blamed the delay on San Diego County officials, in addition to linking the delay to damaging the program to develop the port. The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956, at a cost of $1.2 million, and was in use until 1978, when the I-8 bridge was built. Finally, in May 1957, bids opened for the part of US 80 between Grossmont Boulevard in La Mesa and Chase Avenue in El Cajon, that would connect to the new SR 67 freeway. Groundbreaking took place on June 10, and the project was to cost $3.6 million. The rebuilding of the Cabrillo Freeway interchange became a priority due to the availability of federal funding, and due to the traffic problems encountered with having ramps entering from both the left and the right. In July, the Highway Development Association decided to formally raise the issue of the incomplete highway survey through Imperial County at the next California Highway Commission meeting. In 1958, federal funds were allocated to construct US 80 from Taylor Street to Fairmount Avenue as an eight-lane freeway, and from there to 70th Street as a divided highway. In August, the state announced that there were four proposed routes for US 80 through the mountains, including one with a tunnel. A contract was later awarded to construct the freeway from Taylor Street to the Cabrillo Freeway at a cost of $1.2 million. In November, Caltrans announced that the Walker Canyon route had been chosen for US 80, which would allow for the route to be constructed in stages, as well as being the least expensive alternative. By the end of the year, plans were being made for construction of the freeway between Flume Drive east of El Cajon and Laguna Junction, and the portion of the freeway from Fairmount Avenue to Lake Murray Boulevard was contracted for $2.6 million. In January 1960, the Taylor Street to Cabrillo Freeway portions were under construction, including the interchange at the latter, and were scheduled to be complete by October, while the Cabrillo Freeway to Fairmout Avenue portion was up for bid; the next month, the contract was awarded for $4.6 million, with interchanges to be constructed at Texas Street and Ward Road to replace traffic signals. In July, the new I-8 designation for the road was announced, and plans to post signs were made. Another contract for the portion from Grossmont Summit near Chase Avenue to Ballantyne Avenue was awarded for $2.7 million in November. But in 1960, Jacob Dekema, the district highway engineer, stated that due to lower traffic on US 80, the completion of the freeway through the mountains would be delayed until at least 1971. Construction of the section of US 80 from Magnolia Avenue to Third Street was contracted for $2.7 million in April. That year, work continued on the freeway, and in August, only one traffic signal was left on the highway west of El Cajon, at Ward Road. In August, Dekema announced that bids for the portion between Lake Murray Boulevard and Third Street would be opened the following month; once that was completed, the entire freeway west of El Cajon would be complete. Eastbound lanes between US 395 and Fairmount Avenue opened on November 23. Historic US 80 marker used in California. The portion from the Grossmont summit to Magnolia Avenue and SR 67 was completed in April 1961. By August, the entirety of the freeway west of El Cajon was complete, with the exception of the portions from near Lake Murray Boulevard to near La Mesa Boulevard for $3.1 million, as well as between Magnolia Avenue and the El Cajon eastern city limits for $2.7 million. In addition to this, the part of the freeway from near Grays Well to Ogilby Road in Imperial County was also being constructed for $2.3 million. The freeway portion east of Magnolia Avenue that connected with the undivided US 80 opened on September 6. The final section in La Mesa was completed in April 1962. Construction started on the Mountain Springs portion of US 80 in September 1962. That year, US 80 west of the Cabrillo Freeway interchange was declared to be the busiest road in the City of San Diego, at 71,000 daily vehicles. US 80 was removed from the state highway system on July 1, 1964 during the 1964 state highway renumbering when I-80 was designated; I-8 assumed the routing from San Diego to El Centro and Yuma. However, US 80 signs were posted for several years afterward on the remaining portions of the original asphalt road that had not been bypassed by the freeway. The AASHO formally recognized California's requested elimination of US 80 by 1969. Gradually, the route was removed from Arizona, New Mexico and part of Texas between 1977 and 1991. After the freeway was built, the population of Jacumba went from 400 to 200, and many businesses closed or relocated. However, the population began to increase after a few years, and residents began commuting to jobs in El Centro and San Diego. Following a campaign from the local Old Highway 80 Committee and endorsement from the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, the California State Legislature passed a resolution allowing for the route to be designated and signed as a state historic route, Historic U.S. Route 80, in 2006. In 2018, the Arizona Department of Transportation Parkways, Historic and Scenic Roads Advisory Committee adopted surviving sections of former US 80 in Arizona as a state Historic Road. This supports the California sections by extending the Historic U.S. Route 80 designation through Arizona to the New Mexico state line.

He was later a large investor in the Hooters franchise. Early years Tatum was born in a three-room shack in Durham, North Carolina, the 10th of 13 children, in 1933. He attended Durham's segregated schools, working during the summer in tobacco fields.Sciolino, Elaine. \\"Wilbert Tatum, the Mayor's Debater, Has His Own Flair For The Dramatic\\", The New York Times, 14 July 1984. Accessed 26 February 2009. Education/US Marine Corps He majored in sociology at Lincoln University, the United States' first degree-granting historically black university. During the Korean War, he served in the United States Marine Corps as a drill instructor in Japan from 1951 until 1954. After completing his military service, he attended Yale University as a National Urban Fellow. Tatum was later awarded a master's degree from Occidental College, where he majored in urban studies. Tatum spent 13 years working as a mayoral appointee in the government of New York City, during the John Lindsay and Abraham Beame administrations. While director of community relations at the New York City Department of Buildings, he spent a cold winter's night in 1967 in a Queens housing project that lacked heat, to publicize the circumstances of tenants there. He proposed a $6 billion \\"clothing stamp\\" program that would provide clothing for the poor nationwide while assisting the city's struggling garment industry. Another proposal would have replaced the site of the former Madison Square Garden with an indoor amusement park. Amsterdam News Tatum was part of a group that purchased the paper in the 1970s, the third ownership group in the history of the publication, which included notable investors such as former New York State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Manhattan Borough President Percy E. Sutton. By the mid-1980s, he had invested more than $400 thousand in the publication, most of it borrowed from banks against the value of his real estate holdings. Tatum acquired control of the paper in 1983 and became the paper's sole owner in 1996 after acquiring the stake of the last independent shareholder.Hevesi, Dennis. \\"Wilbert Tatum, Activist Editor, Dies at 76\\", The New York Times, 26 February 2009. Accessed 28 February 2009. During his 25 years with the Amsterdam News his name was \\"nearly synonymous with the paper's\\", as described in a notice by The New York Times announcing his death. Though circulation dropped from 58,907 in 1977 to 25,962 in 2000, the paper remained influential. During the 1984 presidential election, Tatum declined to endorse the candidacy of Jesse Jackson or any of the other Democratic Party candidates. During Tatum's tenure, the paper published a defense of Tawana Brawley after official findings found her 1987 sexual assault claims to be false. In 1989, he decided to disclose the identity of the sexual assault victim in the widely publicized Central Park 5 case. While Ed Koch was Mayor of New York City, Tatum wrote a weekly editorial series, \\"Why Koch Should Resign\\",Lee, Jennifer. \\"Wilbert A. Tatum, 76, Ex-Amsterdam News Publisher, Is Dead\\", The New York Times, 26 February 2009. Accessed 26 February 2009. that ran on the front page from February 1986 to September 1989, accusing Koch of leading an ineffective and corrupt municipal government that did not address the concerns of minority residents of the city. After Koch lost the mayoral primary in 1989 to David Dinkins, Tatum's last editorial read, \\"On September 12 at 11:50 p.m., Edward I. Koch conceded defeat in the primary. December 31 will be his last day of work. End of series.\\" Tatum was credited by members of the city's Jewish community with improving the paper's balance in coverage of Jewish subjects. The associate executive director of the American Jewish Congress recognized in 1984 that \\"Tatum has been very sympathetic and understanding of problems confronting both Jews and blacks\\". Mayor Koch had earlier called the paper \\"an anti-Semitic rag\\" that had become \\"less rabid in its coverage than it was before\\", but held a July 1984 debate with Tatum on Jewish-black relations after Tatum published an editorial critical of the Mayor. While most of the initial investors had left over time, John L. Edmonds had stayed on over the years, feuding with Tatum over the management of the paper and Tatum's use of funds. A suit filed by Edmonds ended in 1996 with a jury finding that Tatum owed Edmonds just over $1 million that it determined had been diverted from the paper's parent company, with Edmonds' attorney describing that Tatum had \\"used The Amsterdam News since 1982 as his own personal piggy bank\\".Barron, James. \\"Jury Finds Publisher of Amsterdam News Diverted Funds\\", The New York Times, 16 April 1996. Accessed 26 February 2009. Tatum stepped down in 1997 and named his daughter Elinor Tatum, then 26 years old and a graduate of New York University's postgraduate journalism program, to serve as publisher and editor-in-chief of the paper. \\"I was in shock\\", she was quoted after the unexpected promotion.Stamler, Bernard. \\"NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM; New Editor, New Ideas, Same Name\\", The New York Times, 21 December 1997. Accessed 27 February 2009. Tatum retained his position as chairman of the board after his daughter took over day-to-day operation of the paper, and he retained the position until his death. Tatum wrote that Al Gore had chosen Joseph Lieberman as his running mate in the 2000 United States presidential election because Lieberman would be able to raise funds from fellow Jews, stating that \\"Gore and his minions did it for the money\\". Asked by his daughter why he did not pursue public office, he responded that he could help most in his role leading the oldest continuously- published African-American newspaper. =Family= Tatum married Susan Kohn, a Jewish refugee from Czechoslovakia. Their daughter, Elinor, was given the choice of following his religion and becoming a Baptist or of following her mother's faith and preparing for her bat mitzvah. Later years As of 1984, he lived in the Manhattan's East Village in a 23-room triplex that he had bought in 1967 for $4,000 and had improved. Through the mid-1980s, he had made money in real estate, purchasing and renovating abandoned or neglected buildings that were reconstructed and repaired using unskilled ex-offenders and political refugee laborers. In 1984, Tatum established an informal group of Jewish and African-American leaders that met to address issues regarding relations between the two communities. That same year, he was recognized by the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies for his efforts on behalf of runaway children in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Death Tatum died, aged 76, on 26 February 2009 from multiple organ failure in Dubrovnik, Croatia, where he was traveling with his wife, Susan. A diabetic, Tatum was a wheelchair user at the time of his death. He was survived by his wife, daughter, a brother and three sisters.

As FM had overtaken AM and KCLU 1590 was a daytimer, it needed the FM as a way to stay competitive. Despite having a more current sound than its adult focused competitor, KCLU was relentlessly hammered by KTTR 1490 as the station that would \\"run down at sundown.\\" The transmitter went up at the studio site at US 63 and I-44 adjacent to the present day Drury Inn. The tower is still present, though the \\"KCLU\\" logo at the bottom and the FM bays for the transmitter have long since been taken down. Although country has always been king in Rolla, KCLU built up a loyal following among the younger audience throughout most of the decade. However, ownership became less willing to spend money on the station, and it found itself a CHR when no one wanted to be a CHR.

It briefly kept the classic rock format only to flip back to AC on October 1, 1995 as KDAA \\"K-Day.\\" On July 17, 2000, the station's license was transferred from Eikon Media, Inc. to KDAA-KMOZ, LLC, along with the license for KMOZ. In mid-2006, KDAA swapped frequencies with a construction permit at 103.1 in Linn, MO, which is the present-day KJMO, in order to facilitate an upgrade of KHZR 97.7 in Potosi. On September 26, 2006, the licenses for KDAA and sister station KXMO-FM were transferred to the current owner, KTTR-KZNN, Inc., for $825,000.

The book was a June 1945 Book of the Month Club selection and was also produced as an Armed Services Edition.Marshall, B: The World, the Flesh and Father Smith Editions for the Armed Services, Inc 1945. Plot summary This is the fictional life story of a parish priest, a man of God \\"conscious of the indwelling of the Trinity,\\" living the life of grace in a drab industrial town, bringing the grace of God to weak human beings seduced by the devil’s ancient lures of the world and the flesh. It covers the activities of Father Thomas Edmund Smith in his urban Scottish parish from 1908 until his death in 1942. On this framework, the author hangs the glowing tapestry of Father Smith's spiritual life, a life of sanctity, humility, and burning love of God. He interacts with a wide range of people, children, adults and other clerics. It also tracks the lives of two particular youths from their innocent childhood affections to their respectives lives as a priest and an actress. Armed Services Edition From the dust jacket: \\"This is the story of Father Smith, priest in a Scottish city – of his friends, the exiled French nuns, of the Bishop, of Monsignor O'Duffy who wages simple, violent war against simple sins, of Father Bonnyboat, the liturgical scholar, of all the people who come into the gentle orbit of Father Smith – from Lady Ippecacuanha, that tweedy convert, to the slut Annie who drives her husband to murder.\\"Marshall, B: The World, the Flesh and Father Smith Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston 1945. A major aspect of the book is the situation of the Catholic Church in Scotland - a minority Church in a predominantly Presbyterian country, which had emerged from centuries of persecution and is still the target of prejudice among significant parts of the Scottish society. It is to a considerable degree the Church of recent immigrants, mainly Irish and Italians (with an additional influx of Poles during WWII, in the later part of the book). Above all, it is predominantly a poor people's Church which is itself a poor church, run on a shoestring. The book begins with Father Smith going a great distance on his bicycle, commuting between two far-flung locations where he has to officiate at services; a few chapters later, Priest and Bishop travel by public transportation since the Diaconal funds do not run to a taxi; the Bishop lives in a modest demi- detached house, though for courtesy it is dubbed \\"The Bishop's Palace\\"... Father Smith is not intimidated by either prejudice or poverty - remarking that suffering a bit of persecution can help to strengthen one's faith, and that the poverty of the Scottish Catholic Church places it closer to the situation of Primitive Christianity. When hit on his head by a jagged stone thrown by bigots, and needing weeks of hospitalization, he considers that the incident can be useful in generating sympathy for the Catholics among the town's mainstream Protestants. And when listening to the singing of his community's amateur chorus, he reflects that no one can doubt the sincerity of their faith - which cannot be said with certainty of the highly-paid tenors singing at the Cathedrals of Seville and Milan. The most obvious symbol of the Catholic Church's situation is that at the start of the book's plot, the town's Catholics have no church building of their own at all, and must rent the town's vegetable market in which to hold their Sunday prayers. Father Smith makes enormous efforts to rectify this situation, succeeding with great effort to erect a \\"Tin Church\\" and finally, after more than two decades of effort, actually having a real Stone Church built. And then, two days before it was to be dedicated, this beautiful new building is destroyed in a WWII German bombing, which also costs Father Smith's life. With literally his last breath, Father Smith reminds the Polish priest who would temporarily replace him that next Sunday's service must be, once again, held in the vegetable market...

Three were planned but only two constructed. Development The power output of piston engines falls with altitude because of the falling oxygen density. As a result, performance falls away and the operational ceiling is limited. Gloster had, with the Gorcock produced an aircraft much faster than its contemporaries and the Guan was designed to use supercharging to maintain this performance at height and raise the service ceiling above its competition. Three Guans were ordered by the Air Ministry in 1925. As in the Gorcock, power came from variants of the Napier Lion broad arrow 12-cylinder engine. The first Guan had the 450 hp (335 kW) geared Lion IV; the second the ungeared 525 hp (475 kW) Lion VI. A projected third aircraft would have had an inverted Lion, known as the Lioness, but this machine was not built. These engines had their exhaust-driven supercharger (a concept nowadays known as turbocharger) mounted on the nose under the propeller, with much exposed pipework. The radiator was mounted under the fuselage and between the undercarriage legs. Initially these engines drove two-blade fixed-pitch airscrews, but the first aircraft was later fitted with a metal variable-pitch constant-speed propeller. The Guan was a single-bay biplane with wooden, fabric-covered wings of unequal span and marked stagger. All Folland's Gloster fighters from the Grebe onwards had used a thick upper wing in combination with a fairly thin lower wing and the Guan followed this pattern, chosen to provide low drag at high speed with good lift at low, take- off speeds. It had parallel interplane struts and ailerons on all wings. The fuselage was all-metal and fabric covered. The rear fuselage was closer in design to that of the Gamecock than the Grebe or Gorcock, and the empennage was almost identical to that of the Gamecock. The first aircraft went to RAE Farnborough in August 1926 and the second followed early in the next year. Supercharging delivered the anticipated performance enhancements, with full power and a top speed of 175 mph (280 km/h) at 15,000 ft (4,570 m). Service ceiling was 31,000 ft (9,450 m) compared with 24,000 ft (7,315 m) for the similarly-powered but slightly smaller-span Gorcock. The fast-spinning turbo- superchargers gave continual trouble. This led to the cancellation of the third Guan and the whole development programme. The name Gloster's search for alliterative bird names took them far and wide. Guan is the local name for one of several genera of game-birds of the family Cracidae, which live in tropical America.

Plot A man embarks on an unspecified mission to infiltrate an old, decaying, abandoned house that rests in a lonely countryside. Making sure not to be spotted by others, the protagonist spends six days inside the house, where he quietly and voyeuristically witnesses a series of bizarre events enacted by various living, antiquated objects (e.g. furniture, meat, and clay) that dwell within the rooms of the house. On Monday, a box full of candies reveal themselves to be rusty nails and screws before placing themselves on the keys of a typewriter. On Tuesday, a cow tongue licks a drawer full of dishes clean before climbing into a meat grinder and being made into tiny scrolls. On Wednesday, a clockwork toy chicken breaks free of its tether and reaches a plate full of corn kernels only to be buried under a pile of brown clay. On Thursday, a desk releases the pigeons that were trapped in its drawer only for them to be plucked by an unseen force, after which a chair tries to use the pigeons' feathers to fly only to crash and shatter on the floor. On Friday, a hose emerges from the buttonhole of a suit jacket and drinks all the water from a flower vase, causing the flowers in the vase to combust, and then urinates the water onto the floor. On Saturday, a pair of dentures bind a cabinet full of pigs' feet with tough wire. On the seventh day, the man – having observed all of the rooms – is ready to complete the last part of his mission. He inserts sticks of dynamite into the very holes he drilled to peer into the rooms. He connects the explosives via a very long fuse to his alarm clock, modifying it into a time bomb. Just as the man is about to depart, he realizes he forgot to check off \\"Sunday\\" on his calendar, so he rushes back into the house to do so. With his mission accomplished, the man runs off into the distance, away from the doomed house.

He was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico. He lives and works in New York City and in El Yunque rainforest in Puerto Rico. Papo Colo is an interdisciplinary artist, whose work ranges from performance, theater and installation art to painting, writing, and graphic design. Early life and career At 18 he left natal Puerto Rico as a merchant marine. After returning to the island in 1971, he falsified a diploma from the University of Puerto Rico as his first conceptual art piece. In New York he studied under the tutelage of the poet Nicanor Parra at Columbia University. His interest in pre-Columbian and Latin American cultures led him to travel across Mexico for a year. From 1973 through 1980 he lived and worked between New York City and Barcelona. During these years he did a series of performances involving physical endurance with political undertones. He is best known for Superman 51, which consisted of the artist running with 51 blocks tied to his back on the West Side Highway until exhaustion. His father, Francisco Colon Garcia, was a boxing champion and his exposure to the glorification of the body through boxing was influential to his work.  Exit Art  In 1982 Papo Colo, with Jeanette Ingberman, founded Exit Art, an internationally known cultural center in New York City. In 1992 he founded the Trickster Theater, an experimental multilingual and multicultural theater company. The company served as an integral part of Exit Art's discourse and was held on the lower level of its facilities. In 2005 he wrote and directed Mplay, a theater piece created solely for the web. He has won numerous awards including The New York Times Best Inaugural Show by an Alternative Art Space for his exhibition Exit Biennial: Reconstruction Additionally, REACTIONS, an international response to 9/11 conceived by Papo Colo, was acquired by The Library of Congress for its permanent collection Jeanette Ingberman died August 24, 2011 from complications of leukemia.  Career as an artist  Besides being the curator and cultural producer of Exit Art, Papo Colo has organized over 100 shows in which he was also the exhibition and graphic designer. His work has been exhibited at numerous venues, including The Clocktower (2013), Galeria de la Raza, San Francisco and MoMA PS1, New York (both 2009), El Museo del Barrio (2008), National Gallery of Puerto Rico (2007), Grey Art Gallery (2006), Art in General (2006), RISD Museum, Providence (2005), Barnes Foundation (2017), Band the Bass Museum of Art, Miami Beach (2001). The retrospective of his early work at MoMA PS1, which was organized by Klaus Biesenbach, coincided with The Cleaner, a new work the artist performed in New York’s Chelsea neighborhood, and culminated with the performance event Procesión Migración that reflected on the constant Puerto Rican migration to the mainland.

There were tennis courts, gardens, and a 110-foot heated saltwater swimming pool lined with Italian marble, spanned at the center by a Venetian marble bridge. The final cost of Ocean House was $7 million—$3 million for construction and $4 million for furnishings. In 1949, the main building opened as a luxury hotel. The third-story gable in the center of the mansion had been the sun deck and sitting room of Marion Davies' private suite. When the Venetian marble bridge spanning the center of the pool was removed, Davies said that \\"the pool was ten feet deep in the middle, and I think it was absolutely wrong for them to remove it.\\" In 1947, Davies sold the estate for $600,000 to hotelier Joseph Drown, who operated it as a luxury hotel and limited-membership beach club. Over the opposition of neighbors Darryl F. Zanuck and Harold Lloyd, the mansion was demolished in 1956. The estate was sold to the State of California in 1960 and developed into a parking lot. The Sand & Sea Club continued until the City of Santa Monica took over operation of the site in 1989. It was run as a public facility open to event rental and filming until the 1994 Northridge earthquake severely damaged all structures on site. After the earthquake, the City of Santa Monica conducted an extensive community process to re-envision the role of the site as an important community gathering space. The resulting reuse plan called for a facility with a 'light touch' on its surroundings and one that would encourage a diverse group of users. The project sat on hold while the City sought funding. In 2005, the Annenberg Foundation, at the recommendation of Wallis Annenberg, made a generous financial commitment to realize the City's vision and preserve the site for public use. The Annenberg Community Beach House at Santa Monica State Beach opened to the public on April 25, 2009, representing a unique partnership between the Annenberg Foundation, California State Parks and the City of Santa Monica. The total construction costs were roughly $30 million. Local residents succeeded in forcing the city to significantly limit its hours of operation. Redevelopment Developed as a design-build partnership between Frederick Fisher and Partners Architects and Charles Pankow Builders, the Annenberg Community Beach House was conceived as a series of indoor/outdoor recreation and event spaces, both formal and informal, woven through the site. The primary organizing device is a concrete wall that serves a backbone to the disparate elements of the project and as a sound buffer to the adjacent highway. The wall is subtly stained with green stripes to suggest beach awnings. The new buildings and landscape elements of the project were designed to create a public gateway to the beach, an icon for the site's history and a framework for many kinds of community uses, returning the site to its former status as a landmark for the City and southern California. The new entry to the facility exists at its southern end with public parking and public transportation drop off areas. A high trellis frames the entrance on a boardwalk that runs the length of the site, parallel to the water, at the line of the mean high tide when the estate was developed. After the Santa Monica Pier was built, the mean high tide line has shifted to enlarge the beach by four hundred feet. This boardwalk is an index of the gradual changes in nature and is a link to each of the four main areas of the site: the Entrance, the Pool and Pool House, the Event House, and the Guest House. The entrance is flanked by the pre-existing \\"Back on the Beach\\" restaurant and public restrooms and showers on one side and the reception, ticketing and lifeguard building on the other. A shaded children's play area and restaurant take-out window are just past the entrance on the beach. The historic pool and deck area, with restored tile mosaics and stone paving, is within a landscaped enclosure below the beach level. Facing the pool is a freestanding white colonnade that defines the location and scale of the mansion's façade. The footprint of the huge structure is delineated on the parking lot behind the Pool House. Behind the colonnade, a series of 14 concrete pillars, each 30 feet high, is the new Pool House with changing rooms, restrooms and built-in cabana areas lined with wood stained in colors taken from the pool tile. On the second floor is a glass-enclosed event room and open terrace that overlooks the pool, with views along the coast from the Santa Monica Pier to the Santa Monica Mountains and back to Palisades Park Midway along the boardwalk, at the center line of the old mansion, a second boardwalk facilitates accessibility across the deep beach to the water's edge. Continuing north, the boardwalk passes beach volleyball courts that maintain the game's presence on the site where it was invented. On the inland side of the boardwalk north of the pool is a series of ground level terraces framed with landscape. These areas include a children's play area with a water feature and other spaces shaded by palm and melaleuca trees. The Event House contains three rooms of different sizes, two with fireplaces, for community use. The boardwalk terminates at the north parking lot. Beach activities are supported by a small building that supplies umbrellas, chairs, boogie boards and other beach paraphernalia. Beach volleyball courts are available for public use as well. The historic guest house is the focal point of the sequence of spaces and structures. Carefully restored, the North House is set within gardens and terraces that create a series of outdoor rooms. A sculptural installation in front of the house by artist Roy McMakin relates to feelings of tradition and domesticity. A waterfall masks the highway sound in this space between the guest house and the Event House. The guest house accommodates community uses and didactic exhibits about the site's history.

Hacienda Yaxcopoil dates back to the 17th century, the name Yaxcopoil means \\"the place of the green alamo trees\\" in the Yucatec Maya language, one of which still stands in front of the hacienda. The Hacienda represents the history of three great periods in the Yucatán Peninsula: the pre-Columbian period (there are ruins nearby), the Spanish colonial period, and the boom years of henequen cultivation during the late 19th and early 20th century. Hacienda Yaxcopoil was purchased by Don Donaciano García Rejón and his wife Doña Mónica Galera in 1864, and has been owned by members of the same family since that time. Hacienda Yaxcopoil was once considered one of the most important rural estates in the Yucatán. The entire property at when it was at its largest covered . It operated first as a cattle ranch and later as a henequen plantation. Over time, due to continuous political, social and economic changes, the estate has been reduced to less than 3% of its original size. Inside the hacienda, besides many original pieces of furniture, are two oil paintings showing Don Donaciano García Rejón and his wife Doña Mónica Galera. The office contains books, maps, documents, and other collections that form part of the archives of Yaxcopoil. These archives have been preserved faithfully and are available to valid researchers. The patron saint of the hacienda is San Gerónimo de Yaxcopoil, who is still venerated in the pueblo near the hacienda. In the orchard, the water tanks and original US-made pump still supply water for hacienda, which now operates as a museum and guest house. In the back of the museum is the \\"Maya Room.\\" There are numerous pieces of ancient pottery and other archaeological relics of the \\"classic period\\" (A.D. 250-900) found in the nearby Mayan ruins of Yaxcopoil. There are numerous unexcavated pyramids with heights that vary from six to twenty meters, a court for ceremonial ball games, and stelae, which are scattered in an area of about eight square kilometers. Hacienda Yaxcopoil also a well- preserved machine house, or casa de maquina, where the henequen shredding machines (planta desfibradora) were used to render fibers from the henequen plant. The engine room has been maintained in good condition with a German diesel motor made by Körting (Hannover) in 1913. The engine was used until 1984, when the production of henequen fiber in the hacienda ended, after more than a century in operation. Hacienda Yaxcopoil has been preserved but not renovated, and now operates as a museum, as well as a location for photo and film shoots. There is also a guest house on the property that can be rented for overnite stay. Chicxulub Crater Research Yaxcopoil was the site of the borehole Yaxcopoil-1, drilled in 2001 and 2002 by the Chicxulub Scientific Drilling Project (CSDP). A multinational research team drilled to a depth of 1511 meters to research the impact and implications of the meteor which struck the earth on the Yucatán Peninsula 66 million years ago and created the Chicxulub crater. The first project to deep-drill and core into one of the largest and well-preserved terrestrial impact structures was executed in the Chicxulub crater in Mexico using integrated coring sampling and in-situ measurements. The combined use of different techniques allows a three- dimensional insight and a better understanding of impact processes. The project cost $1.5 million USD and was led by UNAM, the University Nacional Autonoma de Mexico. The borehole has been used subsequently for testing of the Yucatán's freshwater aquifer.

The team was initiated and formed by Michael \\"Gyp\\" Downey who served as player-coach and the team's manager. The Bears competed in the Eastern League of Professional Football in 1926. Carl Beck The best known member of the team's line-up was Carl Beck, who won the 1924 Anthracite League championship with the Pottsville Maroons. He also won the 1925 NFL Championship with the Maroons before it was stripped from the team due to a disputed rules violation. 1926 season The Bears began their 1926 league season against the Coaldale Big Green, was widely expected to contend for the new league's championship. Beck suffered an injury in the second half of the game and Bethlehem was defeated in a 16-0 shut-out. However, the Bears later rebounded in a 10-0 victory against the Clifton Heights Black & Orange. A few weeks later the Bears defeated the Gilberton Catamounts, featuring future Hall of Famer, Fritz Pollard, 9-0. This win set up a championship scenario for a game between the Bears and the All-Lancaster Red Roses. =1926 Championship controversy= The Bears and the Red Roses were the top two teams in the league. On November 28, 1926 both teams meet for a game that would most likely determine the league champion. The Bears won the 3-0 due to a last minute field goal by Downey. The Bears ended the season with 6-2-2 record against league opponents and a post-season victory over All-Lancaster. Bethlehem felt that these actions were enough to legitimize their claim to an Eastern League championship. However, there was some question regarding Bethlehem's claim to the championship. These questions may have been related to the introduction of several \\"ringers\\" into the Bears line-up for the team's final four games against Eastern League opponents. Local newspapers soon reported that the league awarded the title to the 5-2-3 All-Lancaster Red Roses. Presumably on the basis of that team's October victory over the second-place Gilberton Catamounts. After the season, Bethlehem offered the Pottsville Maroons of the National Football League $4,000 to play them at home.

Frank Barnwell had resisted the idea of a special aircraft, maintaining that the Bristol Bullet was adequate for the purpose, but when Barnwell left the company in October 1921 Fedden and Wilfrid Reid, Barnwell's successor as chief designer, started to work on a monoplane design featuring a wholly enclosed engine. Detail design work was authorised on 5 December, and an order issued to the factory for a single aircraft on 23 January 1922. Design The Bristol Racer was a single-engined mid-wing monoplane with, unusual for the time, a retractable undercarriage. The 480 hp (360 kW) Bristol Jupiter IV radial engine was entirely enclosed within the circular-section fuselage, with an elaborate arrangement of ducts to channel cooling air over the cylinders. A large spinner with a central opening to admit air, constructed of laminated wood with internal wire bracing was fitted. The fuselage, which increased in diameter until the trailing edge of the wing and then tapered to a point, was built around a pair of circular steel frames to which the wing root stubs were mounted: aft of this structure it was a semi- monocoque built up from three laminations of tulipwood over hoops which were braced with radial wires. The fabric-covered wings had composite steel-and- wood spars and were designed as cantilevers, without bracing wires, and were parallel-chord with raked tips and deep full-span ailerons, which accounted for about 20% of the wing's chord. The undercarriage was operated by a handcrank and chain drive, the legs being housed in channels in the fuselage and the wheels within the wing roots. Operational history One aircraft was built in 1922 and registered G-EBDR on 27 June 1922.Civil Aviation Authority Aircraft Registration document for G-EBDR Piloted by Cyril Uwins, it made its maiden flight early in July 1922. This revealed control problems caused by twisting of the wing caused by the overlarge ailerons. For the second fight, bracing wires were added to the wing, but immediately after takeoff on a second flight the spinner disintegrated, the debris causing damage to the wing covering, and the flight was restricted to a single circuit. The first flight had taken place with the spinner unpainted: it had subsequently been painted, and the additional weight of the paint had caused the failure. A third flight, without any spinner, revealed that there was still a problem with the ailerons. An attempt to rectify this was made by fitting a device which produced a small control surface movement for small movements of the joystick, with the rate of control surface displacement progressively increasing as stick displacement was increased. This device, which used a cam on the bottom of the joystick to displace a pair of rollers connected to the ailerons, worked on the ground but under flight loads the rollers were pulled out of contact with the cam, resulting in loss of lateral control. Uwins made yet another wide circuit in the aircraft and again managed a safe landing. For the next flight the cam device was removed and the control issue addressed by reducing the area of the ailerons to around 40% of their original area. At the same time a new spinner was fitted, this being designed to remain static. Three further flights were made, during the last two of which the undercarriage was successfully operated. Although the aircraft had been entered for the 1922 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe competition, and was allocated the racing number 10 which was painted on the tail, it was not in a fit condition to compete, and although it was suggested that it be used as an engine testbed, its flight characteristics were entirely unsuitable for this role and it was eventually scrapped in 1924.Barnes 1981, pp. 124–125.

Sächs. Sts. E. B.). The class included various types of fast-stopping train (Eilzug) locomotive, which had originally come from the Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company and the Eastern State Railway.  History  Forty locomotives were built between 1848 and 1868 for the Leipzig-Dresden Railway (Leipzig-Dresdner Eisenbahn or LDE) for fast passenger services on the route between Leipzig and Dresden; three more were made for the Eastern State Railway (Östliche Staatsbahn) in 1861/62 for employment on the Dresden–Bodenbach railway. The Royal Saxon State Railways grouped all uncoupled locomotives into its Class _ VIa, whereby the prefix _ represented the short form of the manufacturer's name until 1896 (after which it was dropped entirely). Class VI was for the so-called Eilzuglokomotiven (\\"fast-stopping train locomotives\\") and a stood for older (ältere) designs; in this case for the uncoupled engines with a 2-2-2 wheel arrangement. When the K. Sächs. Sts. E. B. was founded in 1869 it initially only had the three Hartmann locomotives from the Östlichen Staatsbahn in its fleet. From 1871 they were classified as Class H VI a. The Leipzig-Dresden Railway had retired the first eight of its locomotives (the Borsig and Hartmann deliveries of 1848/49) by 1868 and converted the next four Borsig engines from 1854 to 0-4-2 tender or tank locomotives in 1873/76. These early machines had significantly different dimensions from the later ones. Following the nationalisation of the LDE in 1876, the 28 remaining engines which had been built by Hartmann in 1856 and Borsig in 1868 were given the class designations H VIa and B VIa respectively, the conversions being classed as B II and B IIa T. The so-called Spinnräder (\\"spinning wheels\\") lasted a surprisingly long time. In 1890 21 engines were still in service, almost half the original fleet. In its last years they were used mainly on local passenger train duties. The last one was retired in 1902, number 6, formerly GUSTAV HARKORT. Railway number 2, formerly BOEHLEN (previously ZÜRICH in the LDE) was the penultimate engine to be withdrawn, in 1900. In 1901 it was taken back by the state railway and was intended to be given to the Saxon Railway Museum. However it was scrapped around 1925.  Technical features  The engines had an inside plate frame and, apart from the three engines with the Eastern State Railway, a Kirchweger condenser. The valve gear was either a Borsig or Stephenson type. In addition the locos had various types of boiler. Most of the locomotives were still being delivered without driver's cabs.

It was described in February 2009 from the late Campanian to early Maastrichtian Adamantina Formation of the Bauru Basin in Brazil, dating to approximately 70 Ma. Armadillosuchus length was estimated on with an estimated body mass of .http://designeranimals.wikispaces.com/Armadillosuchus+Arrudai+(Ancient+animal) Sphagesaurids share a number of mammal-like features in their teeth and jaws, although they are unrelated to mammals. Armadillosuchus is especially mammal- like in that it had heavy body armor characterized by flexible bands and rigid shields that covered its back, less like the traditional osteoderms that line the backs of most crurotarsans and more like that of a modern armadillo (hence the genus name meaning \\"armadillo crocodile\\") or a glyptodont. Because of its unique morphology, it is believed to have had a terrestrial and quite possibly fossorial lifestyle.  Features  Armour plating = Directly behind the skull of Armadillosuchus, protecting the neck, the osteoderms normal to a crocodyliform are fused together to create a rigid shield of hexagonal plates, known by Marinho and Carvalho the researchers as a 'cervical shield'. This is then loosely linked to seven bands of armour that could be moved a little, allowing Armadillosuchus to flex its spine. However, it would probably have been more like a modern giant armadillo or nine-banded armadillo, which can tuck their legs underneath for protection but cannot roll up, than the three- banded armadillo, which can roll entirely into a ball for protection. Each of the armour bands corresponded to several rows of osteoderms that had been fused together. The armour plating on Armadillosuchus\`s tail was more normal for a crocodyliform, but the tall osteoderms along the dorsal surface that provide extra power when swimming for aquatic or riverine species were absent. This feature, along with the long and fairly upright legs, provides evidence that Armadillosuchus had undergone a process of adaptive radiation to fill the ecological niches on land and was entirely terrestrial. = Other noteworthy features = The fossil specimen of Armadillosuchus is not complete, but thanks to the protective armour plating much of it has been reasonably well preserved. The skull is small, with a relatively short snout. The teeth are very unusual; rather than the normal homodont dentition of most crocodyliforms, it had large (approx 6-7 cm) curved teeth like canines, protruding front teeth that resembled incisors, and conical teeth with shearing edges filling the remainder of its mouth. This is common among all sphagesaurids, which often have mammaliform teeth and jaws despite being only distantly related. It is hypothesised therefore that Armadillosuchus was omnivorous. Restoration Armadillosuchus also had long claws on the front legs, which might have been used for digging - whether creating burrows for its own protection or unearthing buried food sources such as roots or small mammals is unknown, though its relatively large size might count against the former. Like an armadillo, it could probably have used these effectively to defend itself, although unlike an armadillo it would also have had a vicious and dangerous bite due to its long 'canine' teeth.

The genus has been described as an example of convergent evolution with beaked whales. Name history The generic name Australodelphis is derived from the Latin australis meaning southern and delphis meaning dolphin, in reference to its discovery in Antarctica. The species name mirus is Latin for strange or wonderful, and was chosen to reflect the unexpected morphology of the type specimen. While not described until 2002, the type specimen of A. mirus was collected between 1985 and 1986, and a further four specimens were found between 1986 and 1994. Prior to the description of Australodelphis in 2002, the genus was mentioned briefly in several publications between 1988 and 1993. The holotype skull was figured in 1988 by R. E. Fordyce and Australodelphis mirus first appeared as a nomen nudum in E. H. Colbert's 1991 \\"Mesozoic and Cainozoic tetrapod fossils from Antarctica\\". A second species of Australodelphis was noted by R. E. Fordyce and P. G. Quilty in their 1993 publication on the stratigraphic context of the Marine Plain sediments, but this second species has yet to be formally described. Type locality The type locality of the genus marks Australodelphis as the first Pliocene higher vertebrate to be named from Antarctica, and the first cetacean to be named from sediments dating after the final breakup of Gondwana. All known specimens of Australodelphis were recovered from sediments of the Sørsdal Formation which outcrops at Marine Plain about 8 km south of Davis Station in the Vestfold Hills of East Antarctica. The fossils are found in massive to poorly bedded muddy siltstone, dated at 4.5 to 4.1 million years old, placing the sediments in the Early Pliocene. The cetaceans of the Sørsdal Formation are found in association with the extinct diatom Fragilariopsis barronii and the scallop Chlamys tuftensis. Poor sorting and fine-grained sediments, combined with cetacean bones and diatom depositions, indicate the area was a sheltered, shallow, glaciomarine inner shelf. Specimens The holotype, CPC 25730, was reconstructed from hundreds of frost-shattered pieces using a combination of polyvinyl acetate and epoxy resin. This prevented the use of acetic acid requiring the use of mechanical methods for specimen preparation. CPC 25730 consists of incomplete right and left mandibles and an incomplete skull missing the basicranium. The other four specimens consist of one partial rostrum, a partial skull consisting of the right side, the rear section of a skull including basicranium, and a partial skull consisting of the narial region and a partial endocranial cast. A number of features of the Australodelphis cranium indicate its position in the family Delphinidae. These feature include asymmetry in the premaxilla ends, an inflated pars cochlearis, and a tympanoperiotic which is not sutured with the squamosal. The genus also shows a number of similarities to the modern genus Mesoplodon, a member of the beaked whale family, Ziphiidae, possessing an elongated toothless rostrum with wide maxillary flanges and laterally compressed tympanic bulla. Taxonomic placement The overall suture patterns of the skull are closest to Delphinidae, while the topography of the rostrum and upper side of the skull is very similar to Ziphiidae, making placement of the genus difficult. O. Lambert noted that Australodelphis has rostrum features similar to those of the family Ziphiidae. However, the first true members of Delphinidae appeared in the late Oligocene, thus the last common ancestor of both Delphinidae and Ziphiidae is estimated to have lived 30 million years ago. The evidence, both morphological and temporal, is that Australodelphis is a member of the family Delphinidae. In their discussion of the species Archaeoziphius microglenoideus, the describing authors O. Lambert and S. Louwye note the distinct similarities between ziphiids but reaffirm the placement of Australodelphis. The Messapicetus sp. specimen CMM-V-3138, found in the St. Marys Formation of Calvert Cliffs, Maryland, is noted to be similar enough in structure to possibly be derived from Australodelphis. However, there are enough differences to make this possibility remote. Australodelphis facial structure indicates a probable feeding style similar to the ziphiid whales, consisting of a rapid opening of the mouth to produce suction for capturing soft bodied prey. This is supported by the toothless rostrum which would make catching prey with a pincer movement difficult, and the small size of the temporal muscles. The structure of the nasal area indicates Australodelphis was likely to have enlarged nasiofacial muscles similar to Mesoplodon and indicate a possible ability to generate high-frequency sounds used in echolocation.

The organization was founded by Shaney jo Darden and Mona Mukherjea-Gehrig in 2000, officially gaining NPO status in 2005. KAB first gained national prominence with their “i love boobies!” bracelets, which were the focus of a U.S. federal court case. Promoting breast cancer prevention via means of education and early detection remains a key focus of KAB's campaigns.  Programs  Check Yourself! = The CYS program creates and distributes breast health education through printed materials, blogs, and the Check Yourself! App. Check Yourself's primary focus is raising awareness on the importance of doing a monthly breast self-check. With 40% of diagnosed breast cancers being self-detected, KAB believes that establishing what is “normal” for you is an important step to knowing your body. In 2018, over 160,000 CYS cards were distributed globally. = Treasured Chest = This program supports women diagnosed with breast cancer or testing positive with the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene with an opportunity to create their own breast cast. TCP kits have been sent out to all 50 states, with a large portion of them having gone out to women under 40. = Non-Toxic Revolution = The NTR mission is to inform, educate and inspire young people to revolt against the dangers of toxic chemicals in their environment and food supply, especially those linked to the development of breast cancer. Its aim is to focus on prevention as a means to maintain long-term health and well-being. Non-Toxic Revolution also provides alternative choices so that young people everywhere can make smart changes.  Campaigns  i love boobies! = In 2008, KAB released their “i love boobies!” shame-free breast awareness message. This message was designed to take a positive approach to breast cancer dialogue. It particularly resonates with young people and encourages them to be open and active about breast cancer prevention. i love boobies! is focused on sparking dialogue among young people about breast cancer and breast health. Many different kinds of i love boobies! merchandise has been made to further this cause, and revenues from this merchandise fund KAB programs and campaigns, broaden its reach and in the past, provide grant money supporting important studies. = School controversy = The \\"i love boobies!\\" bracelets were created by the Keep A Breast Foundation in 2004. The Foundation created and sold a series of one-inch wide silicone rubber bracelets, emblazoned with the slogan \\"i ♥ boobies! (Keep A Breast)\\" to raise money and create a conversation about breast cancer among young people. The positive and upbeat awareness-raising campaign was designed to make young people feel comfortable talking about a subject that is otherwise fearful and taboo. As the bracelets became a fashion craze among teenagers, many school districts began to ban the wearing of these bracelets as the slogan conflicted with school dress codes that prohibit the wearing of any item that includes sexually suggestive language or pictures. A dispute over such a ban reached the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. A panel of three of its judges heard the case, and it was then taken up to be re-heard by all 14 judges en banc. The court ruled 9-5 that the school's ban on the bracelets violated the students' right to free speech because the bracelets were not plainly offensive or disruptive and were speech conducted to raise awareness of a social issue. The U.S. Supreme Court later declined to take up the case. = DIY Action = The DIY Action campaign was created for people that wish to start their own fundraiser benefiting The Keep A Breast Foundation. KAB provides educational materials and awareness merchandise, and the events range anywhere from skateboarding and music events, to cook offs and birthday parties. = #checkyourselfie = This campaign was created to share the message of breast self-checks with friends and followers via social media platforms. It is meant to encourage people to download the KAB Check Yourself! App, since this has become such an effective way to reach teens and young adults. This app is free to download to phones and devices. It shows and explains how to do a self-check and lets users set a monthly reminder for future checks. = Fit 4 Prevention = Fit 4 Prevention is a national movement to raise awareness about breast cancer prevention through fitness and wellness. The goal of F4P is to inspire people to reduce their risk of cancers by adopting a healthier, more active lifestyle. KAB works with studios, gyms and individuals around the country to raise funds and increase awareness for The Keep A Breast Foundation and their mission. = Past campaigns = Imagine If... was a support program intended for young people to share their feelings concerning what the world would be like if there were no cancer. It was part of the Keep A Breast Traveling Education Booth and traveled on music tours, festivals and events around the world. Participants wrote down their response on a small whiteboard, took photos with their Imagine If... response and then shared the photos on the internet and social media. This is My Story is a campaign that gave people a chance to share the impact breast cancer had on their lives through writing or video. Videos and written testimonies were shared on KAB's YouTube Channel, as well as their website and social media platforms.  Breast cast exhibitions  Keep A Breast founders developed a technique for creating breast casts at the start of the organization in 2000. The result was a white plaster/gauze cast that can be customized by artists. The first breast cast auction was in 2000. Some past breast cast exhibitions include: Tokyo LOVE show, Keep A Breast PDX, American Rag X LAB Art, Bare Minerals, Bordeaux Love, and Snow Show.  Warped Tour  Keep A Breast first went on Vans Warped Tour in 2001, and participated each year through 2018, which was the last Vans Warped Tour. This tour was KAB's largest outreach platform, and helped the organization to grow. On this tour, KAB had a tent filled with educational materials and merchandise, as well as volunteers and employees to help educate and provide support for anyone interested. Many of the bands on Vans Warped Tour are Keep A Breast supporters. Through KAB's work with Vans Warped Tour, they were able to take part in several music compilation collaborations featuring many artists they met over the years on tour.  Celebrity involvement  Many professional athletes, celebrities, artists and well-known individuals have been involved with The Keep A Breast Foundation. Pro surfers Lisa Anderson and Layne Beachley, burlesque stars Dita Von Tesse and Catherine D’lish, musicians Iggy Pop, Kim Gordon of Sonic Youth, Mark Mothersbaugh of DEVO, Katy Perry and Tom Delonge of Blink 182 and Angels & Airwaves, and artists Shepard Fairey, Mike Giant, Ed Templeton and Dalek to name a few of the big names that have been supporters and contributed to KAB.  Partnerships  The Keep A Breast Foundation partners with many different companies and organizations to help further their reach. Some of these partnerships are for the month of October, which Keep A Breast refers to as Breast Cancer Prevention Month and some go year round. The support these partnerships offer include product collaborations, outreach, advertising, special events and promotions. A few of KAB's partners have included Rastaclat, HUF, True&Co.;, Valiant Entertainment, and S.W. Basics. In October 1st 2019, Thrive Causemetics donated 100% of its profits to Keep A Breast Foundation, and donated $5 for every repost on Instagram of a certain image with the hashtag #thrivecausemetics for the rest of October.  Global  The Keep A Breast Foundation, as stated in its mission, “is a global non-profit organization 2.” KAB has had affiliates in Japan, Canada, Europe, Mexico and Chile. Currently, Keep A Breast Europe is active and has a headquarters in Bordeaux, France, which was developed by Lorene Carpentier, the organizations Global CEO.  Founder  Shaney jo Daren is the Founder and CCO of The Keep A Breast Foundation. Shaney jo was born in Fullerton, CA and was grew up in Southern California. She began her career in fashion design, which she did predominantly in the action sports industry. In 2008, she quit her job and began focusing on Keep A Breast full-time, shortly after moving the foundation out of her home, and into an office in Carlsbad, CA.

Col. Frederick J. Herman. The American soldiers and militia forces were stationed in Nogales, Arizona, and the Mexican soldiers and armed Mexican militia were in Nogales, Sonora.DeRosey C. Cabell, “Report on Recent Trouble at Nogales, 1 September 1918,” Battle of Nogales 1918, Pimeria Alta Historical Society (Nogales, AZ). See also DeRosey Cabell, “Memorandum for the Adjutant General: Subject: Copy of Records to be Furnished to the Secretary of the Treasury. 30 September 1918,” PAHS. This battle was notable for being a significant confrontation between U.S. and Mexican forces during the Border War, which took place in the context of the Mexican Revolution and the First World War. Prior to the late 1910s, the international border between the two Nogaleses was a wide-open boulevard named International Street, but during the course of the decade the violence associated with the Mexican Revolution and growing hysteria related to World War I brought stricter U.S. control of the border. Anti-foreign sentiment grew in the border region with the publicizing of the German Empire's Zimmermann telegram in February 1917. (Some U.S. military historians of the 10th Cavalry and 25th Infantry later claimed German military advisors encouraged Mexican rebels under General Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa to fight against the U.S. in Nogales.) Related to the World War I anti- foreign sentiment, the shooting deaths of Mexican nationals at the border by U.S. soldiers in Nogales in early 1918 increased racial tensions in the two border towns. As a result of the August 27 battle, the U.S. and Mexico agreed to divide the two border communities with a chain-link border fence, the first of many permanent incarnations of the U.S.–Mexico border wall between the two cities along the two countries' border. BackgroundU.S.–Mexico relations in Ambos Nogales during the Mexican Revolution= The outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910 against the long-time rule of President Porfirio Díaz initiated a decade-long period of high-intensity military conflict along the U.S.–Mexico border, as different political/military factions in Mexico fought for power. The access to arms and customs duties from Mexican communities along the U.S.-Mexico border made towns such as Nogales, Sonora, important strategic assets. The capture of the key border city of Ciudad Juárez in 1911 by Mexican revolutionaries led by Francisco I. Madero (and his military commanders Francisco \\"Pancho\\" Villa and Pascual Orozco) led to the downfall of President Diaz and the elevation of Madero to President. The violent aftermath of Madero's assassination during a coup in 1913 again highlighted the importance of the U.S.-Mexico border, as battles for control of Mexican Nogales between Villistas and Carrancistas (forces of Gen. Venustiano Carranza, a former Villa ally) led to American involvement because of cross-border firing into the U.S.. This took place during the Battle of Nogales (1913) and again during the Battle of Nogales (1915). The inability of the various political factions in Mexico to reach consensus on fundamental political, social and economic reforms prevented the conclusion of the Mexican Revolution until a significant time after the 1918 Battle of Ambos Nogales. During the November 1915 Battle of Nogales fought between the forces of Francisco Villa and Carranza (led by Gen. Álvaro Obregón and Gen. Plutarco Elías Calles), one U.S. serviceman, Pvt. Stephen B. Little, was killed by a stray bullet as U.S. troops guarded the border in Nogales from the violence in Mexico. The carrancistas won the battle over Villa's forces despite three-way firing across the border. Carrancista forces had received diplomatic recognition from the U.S. government as the legitimate ruling force in Mexico. Villa, who had previously courted U.S. recognition, then attacked the American border community of Columbus, New Mexico. This led directly to further border tensions as U.S. President Woodrow Wilson unilaterally dispatched the Punitive Expedition, under Gen. John Pershing, into the state of Chihuahua to apprehend or kill Villa. Although the manhunt for Villa was unsuccessful, small-scale confrontations in the communities of Parral and Carrizal nearly brought about a war between Mexico and the U.S. in the summer of 1916. Additionally, National Guard units of various states were deployed to the U.S.-Mexico border—including Nogales, Arizona—to bolster border security as the Punitive Expedition continued its operations in Chihuahua. The militarization of the border region during this time has led to this period—which includes the Mexican Revolution, the Punitive Expedition and the U.S. entry into World War I—being termed the so-called Border War. Generals Álvaro Obregón, Pancho Villa and John J. Pershing (behind Pershing is Lt. George S. Patton). Despite its initial policy of neutrality, various factors such as unrestricted submarine warfare and the publication of the Zimmermann telegram caused the U.S. to declare war on Germany in April 1917, entering World War I on the side of the Allied powers. Buffalo Soldiers of the U.S. 10th Cavalry Regiment who were taken prisoner during the Battle of Carrizal, Chihuahua, in 1916 After the U.S. entered World War I, the 10th Cavalry was based at Fort Huachuca, Arizona, with elements of that regiment also being stationed in Camp Stephen Little, the army post just north of Nogales. The training and operations Pershing and his forces experienced during the Punitive Expedition prepared them for combat in the Western Front as the American Expeditionary Forces (AEF); consequently, many of the National Guard units deployed to guard the border during the Punitive Expedition were sent to other areas, including the European theater. To fill in the gap, different U.S. military units were deployed to the border, including the celebrated \\"Buffalo Soldiers\\" of the 10th Cavalry. Note: Library of Congress Number: 93-206790 The presence of the 10th Cavalry in Nogales is significant, as this unit was a key participant in the Battle of Carrizal, which could have served as the spark for a U.S.-Mexico War during the Punitive Expedition. Additionally, the presence of the battle- tested 10th Cavalry in the border community of Ambos Nogales—as opposed to joining the AEF at the Western Front—is also suggestive of the racial/social priorities of the U.S. at the time.\\"African Americans in World War I,\\" Oxford African American Studies Center (Oxford University Press U.S.A), accessed 8 January 2013, http://www.oxfordaasc.com/public/features/archive/0508/index.jsp Besides the obvious concern with spill-over violence along the border, U.S. military leaders along the border carried out surveillance of German espionage activities. With the British interception of the Zimmermann telegram in 1917, the U.S. knew well of the German Empire's attempt to bring Mexico into the war on the side of the Central Powers. U.S. anxiety over Germany's overtures to Mexico notwithstanding, the war-weary Mexican nation was in a markedly disadvantaged position from which to engage in the sort of military reconquest of the U.S. Southwest (an area that had been Mexican national territory prior to the 1846–48 U.S.–Mexico War and its peace, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo) that was envisioned in the Zimmermann telegram. The seemingly interminable Mexican Revolution led to the devastation of the overall Mexican economy, causing food shortages throughout the nation (including northern Sonora) and a mass migration of Mexicans into the United States through ports of entry such as Nogales. Additionally, the 1916-17 Punitive Expedition vividly exposed the differences between the U.S. and Mexico in terms of logistics. Though recognized as the legitimate leader of the Mexican Republic, President Carranza did not control large swaths of territory—such as the regions held by Francisco Villa and Emiliano Zapata. Moreover, the U.S. use of motor vehicles and two airplanes during the Punitive Expedition stood in stark contrast to the conditions existing within the Mexican Federal Army and the various disparate militias, where weapons, bullets, uniforms and even food could often be in very short supply. =World War I and national security anxiety in the borderlands= The U.S. entry into World War I led to a mass mobilization of national resources that was soon felt along the border. U.S. restrictions on foodstuffs limited what Nogales border crossers could take back into Mexico. Even as the violence and upheaval of the Mexican Revolution produced scarcity throughout Sonora, U.S. border authorities strictly enforced the restrictions and routinely arrested nogalenses (citizens of Nogales, Sonora) who attempted to smuggle contraband out of the U.S. In the summer of 1918 the U.S. government threatened to close the border if Mexican authorities refused to help stop the “food running”.“May Close Border, Halt Food Runners,” Nogales Herald, 22 June 1918. E.M. Lawton, U.S. consul in Nogales, Sonora, noted that wealthier Mexicans did not suffer the sort of deprivations that “the lower class of the people” felt during this difficult period of sacrifices for the U.S. war effort. Food shortages were common in Mexico during the Revolution. DeRosey C. Cabell, “Report on Recent Trouble at Nogales, 1 September 1918,” Battle of Nogales 1918, Pimería Alta Historical Society (PAHS), Nogales; Parra, Carlos F., \\"Valientes Nogalenses: The 1918 Battle Between the U.S. and Mexico That Transformed Ambos Nogales\\", Journal of Arizona History, Vol. 51 (Spring 2010), 8-9. U.S. involvement in the European war also led to formalization of security measures along the border. In an effort to exercise greater control over the border zone, the State Department called on American citizens to register for passports as soon as possible. These new regulations had a profound impact, as they halted the free transit across the open and unobstructed international line that had defined the relationship between Ambos Nogales. Moreover, entry into Nogales, Arizona, was now restricted to designated inspection stations along International Street, with soldiers posted at intervals along the international line to control human traffic into the U.S. For nogalenses who were accustomed to free passage between the two cities, these rules demanded a difficult adjustment that led to growing hostility between citizens of the two countries.Tinker Salas, Miguel, In the Shadow of the Eagles: Sonora and the Transformation of the Border During the Porfiriato (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1997), 171; Parra, \\"Valientes Nogalenses,\\" 8-11. By August 1918 the U.S. State Department had tightened wartime control at the border by limiting passport- carrying Mexican laborers to two entries per day and restricting non-workers to one crossing per week. A Nogales newspaper reported that the new rules had “greatly curtailed traffic from the Mexican side of the international border, and there is universal weeping among retail merchants of Nogales, Arizona, who see ‘panicky’ times ahead, for those who depend on citizens of the other side of the international line, to swell their daily receipts.” Although businesses in Nogales, Arizona, protested, the persons most affected were working-class nogalenses who depended on wages from their jobs in the U.S.Tinker Salas, 171; “Local News,” The Border Vidette (Nogales, AZ), 3 August 1918. American and Mexican soldiers guarding International Street in Ambos Nogales. The obelisk in the center is a border marker, which still stands. A Mexican border post is in the middle foreground of the image. The Americans had a similar one on their side. In the months leading up to August 1918, U.S. customs officials at Nogales killed at least two individuals who were attempting to enter the U.S. along the vaguely defined border. On the afternoon of 31 December 1917 Francisco Mercado, an off-duty Mexican customs agent, attempted to cross into Nogales, Arizona, despite calls from a U.S. Army sentry who asked him, in English, to stop. Before various eyewitnesses, the soldier shot and killed Mercado.DeRosey Cabell to Commanding General, Fort Sam Houston, Texas, 30 August 1918, Battle of Nogales 1918, PAHS; “Local News,” The Border Vidette, 5 January 1918; “Mexican Shot by Sentry,” Nogales Daily Herald, 13 December 1917. According to witness Frank Arcadia, Mercado was playing with his dog when he crossed the international boundary and came upon the U.S. guard.

The killing of Gerardo Pesqueira, the deaf-mute son of former Sonoran governor Ignacio Pesqueira :es:Ignacio L. Pesqueira, further angered the people of Nogales, Sonora. U.S. sentries ordered the unarmed man to halt as he approached the border. Unable to hear the order, Pesqueira continued walking, whereupon the guards opened fire, killing him. Pesqueira “was known for his caring and cheerful nature. Historian Parra, citing U.S. Gen. DeRosey Cabell's August 1918 military investigation on the incident, highlights that this—along with the crude attitude shown by U.S. customs agents towards ordinary Mexican border crossers during day-to-day transiting of the border—created a profound sense of resentment of U.S. guards by Mexican border agents. The seeming impunity of U.S. border guards was becoming increasingly intolerable to nogalenses, a point made by Gen. Cabell and U.S. Consul in Nogales, Sonora, E.M. Lawton and Vice-consul W.A. Maguire.Alberto Rojas Peña, “Gesta Heróica del 27 de Agosto de 1918” (H.

However, in a brief passage from his 1921 book History of the Tenth Cavalry, 1866-1921 Edward Glass indicates that changes in Mexican officials and soldier attitudes helped contribute to the tense situation. =German espionage or national security hysteria in the borderlands= Allegations of foreign wrongdoing arose from the U.S. Army units that claimed their Intelligence Division in Southern Arizona reported that Germans were instructing the Mexican Army in military procedures and helping build defenses. Lt. Col. Frederick J. Herman of the 10th Cavalry (the acting commander in Nogales at the time) claimed to have received an \\"anonymous letter\\" written by an \\"unknown Mexican\\" claiming to be an ex-Villa officer in which he warned U.S. authorities of an imminent attack on Nogales slated to take place on 25 August 1918.Clenenden, Clarence C. Blood on the Border: The United States Army and the Mexican Irregulars (London: Macmillan Company, 1969) In his 1921 history of the 10th Cavalry, author Edward Glass states the importance of these reports as \\"About 15 August 1918, the Intelligence Division reported the presence of strange Mexicans, plentifully supplied with arms, ammunition, food and clothing, gathering in increasing numbers in and about Nogales, Sonora.\\" He also indicated the presence of several white men, apparently Germans in uniforms, instructing Mexican soldiers and militia in military methods. About this time a letter was received, written by a person who claimed to have been a major in Villa's forces. It reportedly stated the person was sickened and disgusted at the atrocities committed by Villa and his men, and without pay or reward, because of \\"friendly respect\\" for American troops, warned them of the German financial efforts and influences at work near and in Nogales. These German \\"agent provocateurs\\" were encouraging some type of attack on Nogales \\"on or about 25 August 1918.\\" Lt. Robert Scott Israel, Infantry Intelligence Officer at Nogales, brought this letter to the attention of Lt. Col. Herman, 10th Cavalry, then acting subdistrict commander at Nogales. Further investigation revealed that so many points of the letter were verified that \\"the letter was given more than ordinary weight.\\" Note: Finely quotes: Glass, Edward L.N., History of the Tenth Cavalry, 1866-1921, Old Army Press, 1921,83. However, in a 2010 article by Carlos F. Parra, which includes additional details of the incident, the author highlights how neither the suggestive intelligence reports nor the alleged letter to Lt. Col. Herman were mentioned at all during the extensive U.S. military investigation that took place immediately after the 27 August incident. The investigation of the Battle of Ambos Nogales instead traced the origins of the violence to the abusive practices of U.S. customs officials and the resentment caused by the killings along the border during the previous year. In the written transcripts of the investigators' interviews with Lt. Col. Herman, the local commander made no mention whatsoever of the letter he later claimed to have received from the \\"unknown\\" and disgruntled Villista defector. The omission of such powerful evidence from an investigation conducted mere hours after the battle took place makes the existence of these intelligence reports and Lt. Col. Herman's letter (which does not appear in the U.S. Army investigation's document collection for this battle) highly suspect. Note: Parra's 2010 article conflicts with many details and interpretations previously documented in military reports and unit histories. Battle On 27 August 1918, at about 4:10 pm, a gun battle erupted unintentionally when a civilian Mexican carpenter named Zeferino Gil Lamadrid attempted to pass through the border back to Mexico, without having the bulky parcel he was carrying with him inspected at the United States Customs house. As Gil Lamadrid passed the customs office, Customs Inspector Arthur G. Barber ordered him to halt, suspecting that Gil Lamadrid was smuggling weapons. Only a few feet away, Mexican customs officers led by Francisco Gallegos directed him to ignore the summons and stay put in Mexico. Gil Lamadrid became confused and hesitated as the two groups of customs agents shouted instructions to him. At this point Pvt. William Klint of the U.S. 35th Infantry raised his Springfield rifle in an effort to force Gil Lamadrid to return to the U.S. In the midst of the ensuing commotion, a shot was fired (although it is suspected it was only a warning shot to the air fired by Pvt. Klint to prevent Zeferino from taking his cargo further in to Mexico), however by whom remains unclear, and the battle of Ambos Nogales commenced.“Second Battle of Nogales,” The Border Vidette, 31 August 1918; Alberto Suárez Barnett, Mi Historia . . .

The tomb of Andrés Ceceña, a Mexican customs official killed during the 27 Aug. 1918 Battle of Ambos Nogales, is located in Heróica Nogales, Sonora's Panteón de los Héroes. Mistakenly believing that he was being shot at, Gil Lamadrid dropped to the ground. Perhaps thinking that Gil Lamadrid had been shot, Customs Officer Gallegos grabbed his pistol and opened fire on the U.S. guards, killing Pvt. Klint with a shot to the face. Inspector Barber drew his revolver and returned fire, killing Gallegos and fellow Customs Officer Andrés Ceceña. In the confusion Gil Lamadrid jumped up and sprinted down a nearby street, exiting the narrative of the battle that he had inadvertently started.Flores García, Nogales, Un Siglo en la Historia, p. 55; Suárez Barnett, Mi Historia, p.12; Rojas Peña, “Gesta Heróica,” p. 2. Gil Lamadrid died in an altercation in a Nogales, Sonora, bar in 1935 near where the Battle of Ambos Nogales initially took place.Parra, \\"Valientes Nogalenses,\\" 12-14. =Combat along the border and the U.S. Army incursion into Nogales, Sonora= Many citizens on the Mexican side of the border, hearing the gunfire, ran to their homes and picked up their rifles to join the Mexican troops fighting. Although it was later speculated that most of the combatants were soldiers of the Mexican Federal Army, in fact part of the Nogales garrison was away fighting rebels opposed to Gen. Plutarco Elías Calles' governorship of Sonora. Several Mexican soldiers, acting without orders, were certainly among the combatants, but the majority of the combatants were civilians—a fact confirmed by a U.S. military investigation of the incident.Noriega, “Memories,” p. 198; Cabell, “Report on Recent Trouble at Nogales, 1 September 1918,” Battle of Nogales 1918, PAHS. The 35th Infantry, stationed at Nogales, requested reinforcements. Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry, commanded by Lt. Col. Frederick Herman, came to their aid from Camp Stephen Little, located just north of Nogales. Herman ordered an attack south of the border to secure the Mexican hilltops overlooking the Sonoran border town. Defensive trenches and machine gun emplacements had been seen being dug on those hilltops during the previous weeks. Herman wanted his forces to occupy the position before Mexican reinforcements got there. In the frenzy of the unexpected battle, armed Mexican civilians stormed the home of Gen. Álvaro Obregón on International Street and used its sturdy stone walls as a strongpoint from which to fire at U.S. targets. Although the important Mexican revolutionary general (and future President) was not home, his terrified family was, and as a sign of the links between the two cities of Nogales, were personally escorted to the home of relatives on the U.S. side by the U.S. Consul in Nogales, Sonora, E.M. Lawton.Parra, \\"Valientes Nogalenses,\\" 14. Under heavy fire, the U.S. infantry and dismounted cavalry crossed the border through the buildings and streets of Nogales, Sonora. Members of the 10th Cavalry advanced through a building in the red-light district of the Mexican border town where many of the \\"frightened señoritas\\" recognized them, according to First Sgt. Thomas Jordan of the 10th Cavalry. Jordan remarked, \\"I got a laugh when one them spoke to a trooper, saying 'Sergeant Jackson! Are we all glad to see you!' But we did not have time to tarry for the soldier to alibi his acquaintanceship.\\"\\"The Battle of Ambos Nogales,\\" Buffalo Soldiers in Fort Huachuca, http://net.lib.byu.edu/estu/wwi/comment/huachuca/HI2-06.htm As the troops advanced into the city, many of these women ventured out with bedsheets marked with impromptu red crosses in an effort to rescue persons wounded in the fighting. Two of the brave women ignored their own wounds to help rescue their fellow citizens.“Sidelights of Battle,” Nogales Herald, 30 August 1918; “Colonel Herman is Pleased with Help of Nogales People,” ibid., 7 September 1918; Clarence C. Clenenden, Blood on the Border: The United States Army and the Mexican Irregulars (London: Macmillan Company, 1969), p. 347; Lechuga Bórquez, “Por que la H se antepone al nombre de Nogales, Sonora, México,” p. 1; Flores García, Nogales, Un Siglo en la Historia, 57. American civilians and women helped in rescuing the wounded on the American side. One American soldier received an award from the American citizens for his actions in saving noncombatants who had been wounded, despite being wounded himself. U.S. and Mexican sources differ on the success of U.S. troops taking the imposing hills immediately to the east of the two cities of Nogales. U.S. sources indicate that the heights were taken (and held until that evening's cease-fire) by a combined assault of the 10th Cavalry and 35th Infantry. For their part, Mexican sources, such as the contemporary \\"Corrido de Nogales\\" (a Mexican ballad about the battle's main events), highlight the participation of the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th Cavalry during the assault on these hills. In the \\"Corrido de Nogales\\", it is also claimed that the Mexican townspeople of Nogales stopped the assault on that hill at the eastern end of the Nogales communities.Flores García, Silvia Raquel Nogales, Un Siglo en la Historia (Hermosillo, Sonora, Mexico: INAH-SEP, Centro Regional del Noroeste, 1987), 55; Antonio Avitia Hernández, Corrido Histórico Mexicano. Vol. 3: Voy a cantarles la historia, 1916-1924 (México, D.F.: Editorial Porrúa, 1998). Nevertheless, during the assault Capt. Joseph D. Hungerford was killed by a bullet to the heart while leading the 10th Cavalry charge on the hill.Parra, \\"Valientes Nogalenses,\\" 16. Meanwhile, a few U.S. civilians used their vehicles to shuttle troops toward the border, but only one U.S. military vehicle, driven by Private James Flavian Lavery, crossed the border, delivering supplies and retrieving the wounded. Lavery was decorated with the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions. American militia who became involved stayed on the American side, firing their weapons from the windows of their houses. Allyn Watkins, an eyewitness to the shooting from the rooftops of homes along a tall hill on the U.S. side, claimed that the disordered involvement of U.S. civilians in the border fight “didn’t help the progress of the ‘war’ any.”Finley, James P. “Buffalo Soldiers at Huachuca: The Battle of Ambos Nogales.” Huachuca Illustrated, vol. 2 (1996); Rojas Peña, “Gesta Heróica,” p. 2; Noriega interview, PAHS. Allyn Watkins interview, Arizona Historical Society (Tucson, AZ). Late in the fighting, members of the 35th Infantry placed a machine gun on top of a stone building and fired into the Mexican positions. The capture of the heights and this machine gun fire encouraged the end of the fighting. =Death of Mayor Peñaloza and a cease- fire= The tomb of Felix B. Penaloza (Mayor of Nogales, Sonora, in August 1918) at the Panteon de los Heroes, Heroica Nogales, Sonora, Mexico As the violence escalated, the Mayor of Nogales, Sonora, Felix B. Peñaloza, sought to stop the shooting. The 53-year-old presidente municipal took a white handkerchief, tied it to his cane and ran into the streets of his city hoping to quell the violence. As U.S. troops advanced into the streets of Nogales, Sonora, from their positions across the line, Presidente Peñaloza pleaded with the angry nogalenses to put down their weapons. Despite later accounts to the contrary by U.S. military personnel (including Lt. Col. Herman), an official note from the U.S. Consulate in Nogales, Sonora, confirmed that a shot “from the Arizona side” felled the Mexican mayor. The mortally wounded Peñaloza was dragged into a nearby pharmacy, “where nothing could be done to save him.” He died a half-hour later.Rojas Peña, “Gesta Heróica,” p. 2; Lawton, “Records,” pp. 195-96; Suárez Barnett, Mi Historia, p. 12; Parra, \\"Valientes Nogalenses,\\" 14-16. With Peñaloza's death, panicked officials in the Nogales, Sonora, city hall and the Mexican Consul in Nogales, Arizona, Jose Garza Zertuche, worked to bring about a cease-fire before further bloodshed. After initial contacts with Lt. Col. Herman were unsuccessful in ending the violence—the military commander in Nogales, Arizona, was wounded in the thigh during the fight—local Mexican officials agreed to raise a white flag over the community's most prominent structure at the time, the Mexican customs house. About 7:45 pm the Mexicans waved a large white flag of surrender over their customs building. Lt. Col. Herman observed this and ordered an immediate cease-fire. Snipers on both sides continued shooting for a while after the cease fire, but were eventually silenced by the efforts of their leaders on both sides. As a tenuous and suspicious peace fell on the border community, sporadic rifle shots were heard throughout the night, causing many to fear further violence. Subsequently, many non-combatants in Nogales, Sonora, fled south, away from their city. The international border in this important port of entry remained closed until the late the next day.Parra, \\"Valientes Nogalenses,\\" 16-17. AftermathBi-national diplomatic talks and the U.S. investigation= Within hours of the outbreak of violence in Ambos Nogales, leaders of the two governments dispatched officials to investigate the Nogales incident and determine what could be done to resolve the situation. President Carranza sent Sonoran governor Plutarco Elías Calles to represent the Mexican government in diplomatic talks scheduled for 28 August, while Gen. DeRosey Cabell, a veteran of the Punitive Expedition, represented the U.S. and sought information on the violence. “I met with General Calles at 3 o’clock, having previously received a telegram from him expressing regret at the unfortunate incident of yesterday afternoon,” Cabell remarked. “Upon meeting with General Calles I have expressed equal regret that this incident should have occurred.” Supreme Court Justice (and former U.S. President) William Howard Taft, Mexican President Plutarco Elías Calles and U.S. President Calvin Coolidge at the White House, 1924: Although future-president Elías Calles' involvement in settling the Ambos Nogales dispute was small when compared to his later accomplishments, it was indicative of the Sonoran leader's growing stature in Mexican politics during the 1910s and '20s. Cabell reiterated the U.S. demand that Sonoran officials halt the sporadic shooting from the Mexican side of the border, to which Calles said that the shooters were “irresponsible men” and beyond his control. All civilians in Nogales, Sonora, had been ordered to turn in their weapons to the authorities; some, however, retained their arms. In addition to exchanging mutual assurances of peace, Cabell and Calles each pledged to investigate the incident. Border traffic resumed as the military conference continued, and peace apparently had returned to Ambos Nogales.Parra, \\"Valientes Nogalenses,\\" 18. Before full normality returned to the community, a U.S. soldier was wounded by fire from the Mexican side; after lying in the post hospital for a few hours, the angry trooper went to the border and shot and wounded a Mexican sentry keeping guard. After a brief but angry exchange with Calles, Cabell ordered the arrest of the vengeful army private and prevented further violence.Parra, \\"Valientes Nogalenses,\\" 18-19. Cabell conducted an investigation in which he and his associates interviewed a range of civilians (including U.S. Consul Lawton) and military personnel in an attempt to determine what caused the border violence that 27 August. After completing his investigation, Gen. Cabell informed his commanding officer that an unnamed U.S. customs inspector had been found guilty of “improper conduct” and removed from duty because of his harsh treatment of Mexicans. Cabell's report expressed dismay at the “frequent cases of insolence and overbearing conduct” among U.S. customs inspectors. The investigation laid the blame, albeit begrudgingly, for the outbreak of violence in Ambos Nogales on resentment among nogalenses over the routine mistreatment of Mexican border crossers.Parra, \\"Valientes Nogalenses,\\" 20-21. Echoing Cabell's findings, José Garza Zertuche, the Mexican Consul in Nogales, wrote that “both peoples, Mexican and American, now deplore the unfortunate happenings on this frontier 27 August, last, and in which the lives of many soldiers of that country [United States] were lost.” However, he also drew attention to the abuse from U.S. Customs and Immigration officials that had prompted the Mexican people to fight, and memorialized the “many Mexican civilians who laid down their lives in fitting protest against such humiliating and unjust conduct toward them.”Parra, \\"Valientes Nogalenses,\\" 20. Finally, Gen. Cabell's report recommended that a two-mile-long border fence be erected down the middle of International Street. That, Cabell wrote, “will do more [to] prevent friction than any other measure.” Gov. Calles acceded to Cabell's proposal. “In opinion [of] both officials,” the Nogales Herald reported, “[the] clash [of] August Twenty-Seventh and two previous clashes this year would have been averted had this fence been built.”“Military Commanders Hold Final Conference Sunday,” Nogales Evening Daily Herald, 2 September 1918; Arreola, “La Cerca y Las Garitas de Ambos Nogales,” pp. 504-541. The raising of the first permanent border fence through the Ambos Nogales community is significant as it signaled the end of the previously open nature of the international border in this community. Although the Mexican Revolution and World War I, and their related tensions, faded by the early 1920s, the border security issue would remain a major concern culminating in the U.S. Immigration Act of 1924 and the establishment of the U.S. Border Patrol that year. =U.S. casualties= The United States Army suffered three dead and 29 wounded, of which one died later of wounds Killed in action: * Klint, William H., Pvt., (H Co., First American KIA just after 4:10PM, just inside Mexico guarding U.S. Customs inspector Arthur G. Barber) * Loftus, Luke W., 2nd Lt., (C Co., killed by sniper) * Lots, Barney, Cp., G Co. * Whitworth, Frank, Cpl., H Co. * Hungerford, Capt., 10th Cavalry, Troop C - the 35th Regimental History page for this battle states Hungerford was shot through the heart and killed instantly. In addition, 16 men of the 35th Infantry were wounded. These included: Wounded in action: *Quartermaster Sgt. Victor Arana, with the 35th Infantry, was wounded. *Pvt. A. L. Whitworth, Co. G, 35th Infantry, was hit in the groin. *A private (Co. F, 35th Infantry) was hit and fell across the street from the home of \\"Colonel\\" A. T. Bird. In addition, 12 soldiers from the 10th Cavalry were cited as wounded. These included: *Lt. Col. Frederick J. Herman, Tenth Cavalry, the commander, suffered a slight but hampering leg wound. *Capt. Henry C. Caron, Troop F, 10th Cavalry, was hit in the right arm below the elbow. Known awards for bravery given: *Lavery, James Flavian, Quartermaster Pvt., 35th Infantry, earned a Distinguished Service Cross at the Battle of Nogales for \\"braving the heaviest fire, repeatedly entering the zone of fire with his motor truck and carrying wounded men to places of safety, thereby saving the lives of several soldiers.\\" *Fannin, Oliver, Lt., G Co., 35th Infantry, would win the Distinguished Service Cross \\"For valor and bravery . . . while under fire, carried a wounded man to safety in the Nogales battle.\\" He was also the recipient of a testimonial prepared by 33 of the leading citizens of Nogales. This differs slightly from a list of the 35th Infantry Regiment who are listed as killed in action on 27 August 1918. It also cites one officer of the 10th as having been killed. James Flavian Lavery, Quartermaster Private, 35th Infantry, earned a Distinguished Service Cross at the Battle of Nogales for \\"braving the heaviest fire, repeatedly entering the zone of fire with his motor truck and carrying wounded men to places of safety, thereby saving the lives of several soldiers.\\" Oliver Fannin, Lieutenant, G Company, 35th Infantry, was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross \\"For valor and bravery ... while under fire, carried a wounded man to safety in the Nogales battle.\\" He was also the recipient of a testimonial prepared by 33 of the leading citizens of Nogales. Arizona militia and civilian casualties were two dead and several wounded. =Mexican casualties= A great deal of uncertainty surrounds the actual number of Mexican casualties from the incident. According to John Robert Carter of the 25th Infantry Regiment (which replaced the 35th Infantry in Nogales), the U.S. believed that as many as 125 persons were killed and 300 wounded. However, the official report by the Mexican government lists the dead at 15, with special attention given to the actions of Francisco Gallegos, Andres Ceceña and the fallen mayor Felix B. Peñaloza (the latter of whom has been consistently ignored by the few U.S. observers who have written about the battle). Although the actual number of casualties between the wildly varying figures given by the U.S. and Mexican governments is uncertain, the Sonoran dead included three-year-old Julia Medina, 17-year-old María Esquivel and María Leal, shot while hanging clothes near the border.Parra, \\"Valientes Nogalenses,\\" 21. *Mexican casualties were reported later, by John Robert Carter of the 25th Infantry Regiment as being 125 (28-30 in Mexican Army uniforms) killed and 300 wounded. Found among the Mexican dead were allegedly two German agents. It is important to note, however, that neither Carter nor the 25th Infantry Regiment were in Nogales when the battle or its immediate aftermath occurred (the 25th Infantry replaced the 35th Infantry Regiment in Nogales). Evidence suggests some elements of the Mexican garrison in Nogales, Mexico, participated in the battle but local newspapers such as the Nogales Herald noted that the majority of the unit had left Nogales in the days before the battle to engage anti-government rebels led by revolutionist Juan Cabral near Sasabe. *According to the U.S. Army official report, the graves for 129 Mexicans were dug. However, Mexican casualties reported in various newspapers ranged from 30 to 130 dead and over 300 wounded in action. U.S. military historians Edward Glass and James Finley, basing their conclusions on second- hand accounts, have written that the bodies of two alleged German advisors were recovered and examined by the U.S. Army after the August 27 battle and then buried. According to Glass and Finley, the two bodies possessed papers with German writing while other alleged German advisors reportedly fled southward along with frightened Mexican townspeople from Nogales. Finley also claimed that in the days after the battle the remains of the two alleged Germans were disinterred and their whereabouts became unknown. *No evidence (such as the deceased Germans' documents) exists to support Glass and Finley's claims about German involvement in the battle in either local, state, or national archives on either side of the border. Oral histories of elderly Nogales residents conducted by the Pimeria Alta Historical Society in the 1960s and 1970s indicated that people who lived in the community during the battle were not familiar with the claims of German espionage in Ambos Nogales. Furthermore, archival collections at the U.S. National Archives such as the U.S. Army's Adjutant General Office documents and the U.S. Department of State's Consular Records for Nogales, Mexico (including correspondence from Secretary of State Robert Lansing to the U.S. Ambassador to Mexico) make clear that the Battle of Ambos Nogales was a conflict entirely of a local character between the U.S. and Mexican nationals.

Nevertheless, low-level rumors circulated of potential German involvement in this battle. Echoing the comments of some U.S. participants in the battle, James P. Finley wrote in Huachuca Illustrated \\"found among the Mexican dead were the bodies of two German agents provocateurs.\\"Finley, “Buffalo Soldiers at Huachuca: The Battle of Ambos Nogales,” Huachuca Illustrated, vol. 2 (1996) No further corroborating evidence—such as a description of these individuals' particular persons, belongings or potential intelligence reconnaissance from Nogales residents—is presented by Finley or other authors who have written on the topic. Fred Herman, whose wartime rank of lieutenant colonel had been reverted to his regular army (i.e. peacetime) rank of captain, testified before a congressional committee headed by New Mexico Sen. Albert Fall that he believed that German agents led the Mexican combatants during the 27 August battle. U.S. Sen. Albert Fall of New Mexico, angry over the 1917 Mexican Constitution's calls for the nationalization of the oil industry, Fall—with deep ties to the oil industry—sought to pressure the Mexican government from enacting such policies through coercive measures, such as threats of military intervention in Mexico. His congressional hearings in 1920 on border outrages included testimony from the former military commander in Nogales, Arizona, Fred Herman. Herman claimed that \\"German-looking men in uniforms” were the culprits of the Battle of Ambos Nogales citing his documentation.“Says Carranzistas Led Nogales Fight,” New York Times, 12 February 1920; Fall, Albert Bacon. Investigation of Mexican Affairs, (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1920), p. 1813. Historians who have investigated the brief conflict have generally repeated Herman's allegations at the expense of obscuring the social tensions that led to the battle.Trow, Clifford W., “Woodrow Wilson and the Mexican Interventionist Movement of 1919,” Journal of American History, vol. 58 (June 1971), pp. 46-72.; Clenenden, Blood on the Border; Glass, History of the Tenth Cavalry, p. 84; and Eppinga, Jane, Nogales: Life and Times on the Frontier (Chicago: Arcadia Publishing, 2002). Legacy The sudden burst of violence associated with the Battle of Ambos Nogales, soon followed by the resolution of the conflict by Cabell and Calles, coupled with the relatively low casualties of the confrontation, compared to the carnage associated with the Western Front, ensured that the battle would remain obscure. No monument or other physical historic memorial commemorates the battle on the U.S. side.Parra, \\"Valientes Nogalenses,\\" 26. On the Mexican side, the batalla del 27 de agosto is also an obscure topic but less so. A Mexican corrido, \\"El Corrido de Nogales\\", it was composed by participants of the battle, memorializing the Mexican interpretation of the events of that day. The municipal leaders in Nogales, Sonora, erected a monument near the international boundary commemorating the Mexican participants and victims of the battle, and the municipal government continues to maintain the tombs of Mayor Peñaloza, Andres Ceceña, Maria Esquivel, and other victims in the city's Panteón de los Hėroes. Pre-2011 U.S.–Mexico border wall as seen from the Mexican side along Calle Internacional in Heroica Nogales, Sonora In 1961 the Mexican Congress further honored the memory of 27 August 1918 by granting the Mexican border town the title of \\"Heroic City\\", leading the community's official name, Heróica Nogales, a distinction shared with other Mexican cities such as Heróica Huamantla, Tlaxcala, and Heróica Veracruz, Veracruz, communities that also saw military confrontation between Mexicans and U.S. military forces. =Border fence= In addition to the physical reminders of the Battle of Ambos Nogales through monuments and folklore, the presence of the current US–Mexico border fence running through the community owes its existence at least in part to the events of 27 August 1918. Unlike earlier fences that had been erected and removed on International Street, the new border barrier was permanent. Although residents of Ambos Nogales continued to maintain strong familial ties across the international boundary, the border fence vividly signaled the transformation of the border community of Nogales into two different cities in two different nations.Parra, \\"Valientes Nogalenses,\\" 23-24.

This name is the Italian term for \\"perfect murder\\", and it refers to the ability of the technique to create desired genetic changes without leaving any foreign DNA in the genome.  Background  This technique was developed by a group at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) composed of Michael A. Resnick, Francesca Storici (now at Georgia Institute of Technology), and L. Kevin Lewis (now at Southwest Texas State University). The method uses synthetic oligonucleotides in combination with the cellular process of homologous recombination. Consequently, it is well suited for genetic manipulation of yeast, which has highly efficient homologous recombination. The delitto perfetto approach has been used to produce single and multiple point mutations, gene truncations or insertions, and whole gene deletions (including essential genes).  Advantages  The primary advantage of this technique is its ability to eliminate any foreign DNA from the genome after the mutagenesis process. This ensures there are no selectable markers or exogenous sequences used for targeting left in the genome that may cause unforeseen effects. The delitto perfetto technique is also simpler compared to other methods for in vivo site-directed mutagenesis. Other methods require multiple cloning steps and extensive DNA sequencing to confirm mutagenesis, which is often a complicated and inefficient process.Erdeniz N., Mortensen UH., Rothstein R. (1997) Cloning-free PCR-based allele replacement methods. Genome Res. 7:1174-83.Langle-Rouault F., Jacobs E. (1995) A method for performing precise alterations in the yeast genome using a recyclable selectable marker. Nucleic Acids Res. 23:3079-81.Scherer S., Davis RW. (1979) Replacement of chromosome segments with altered DNA sequences constructed in vitro. Proc Natl Acad Sci. 76:4951-5. There is great flexibility in this approach because after the CORE cassette is inserted (see Method Overview for details), multiple mutations in the gene of interest can be made easily and quickly. This method can be applied to other organisms where homologous recombination is efficient, such as the moss Physcomitrella patens, DT40 chicken cells, or E. coli. In addition, human genes can be studied and similarly genetically manipulated in yeast by using yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs).  Disadvantages  Since the delitto perfetto technique is based on homologous recombination, this process must be functional in the cells for the technique to work. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the RAD52 gene is essential for homologous recombination, and thus is required for the delitto perfetto method. The method is useful only for applications where selectable markers are not necessary. For example, mutagenized yeast strains cannot be used for further genetic analysis such as tetrad analysis. Markers would have to be inserted into the appropriate locus in a separate process. =Technical drawbacks= * Cost of oligonucleotides * Mutagenesis is limited to region of genome surrounding the inserted cassette * Limited number of reporter genes (restricted by available CORE cassettes) * Low efficiency for certain applications (e.g. deleting essential genes)  Method overview  Delitto Perfetto is a two step method for in vivo mutagenesis. In the initial step, the CORE cassette is inserted in the region of interest by homologous recombination. Subsequently, the CORE cassette is replaced with DNA containing the mutation of interest. Figure 1. CORE Cassettes for Delitto Perfetto =CORE cassettes= The CORE cassette contains both a COunterselectable marker and REporter gene. The reporter gene allows for the selection of yeast cells that receive the CORE cassette during the first step of the process. The counterselectable marker allows for the selection of yeast cells that lose the CORE cassette by the integration of the mutated oligonucleotide during the second step of the process. There are a variety of CORE cassettes to choose from, which contain a variety of reporter genes, counterselectable makers and additional features.Storici F., Resnick MA. (2006) The delitto perfetto approach to in vivo site-directed mutagenesis and chromosome rearrangements with synthetic oligonucleotides in yeast. Methods Enzymol. 409:329-45. =Reporter genes= * kanMX4 – allows for growth in media containing Geneticin * hyg – allows for growth in media containing Hygromycin B. =Counterselectable markers= * KlURA3 – prevents growth in media containing 5-fluoroorotic acid. * GAL1/10-p53 – prevents growth in media containing galactose. It encodes a toxic mutant of p53 under a GAL1 promoter.Inga A., Resnick MA.

Oncogene. 14;20(27):3573-9 =Additional features= * GAL1-I-SceI – Increases the efficiency of targeting to the CORE cassette- containing chromosome in diploid cells. It contains the restriction endonuclease SceI under the GAL1 promoter and the SceI target sequence.Storici F., Durham CL., Gordenin DA., Resnick MA.

Overview ofDelitto Perfetto for Gene Deletion Technique workflow First the CORE cassette is amplified by PCR with primers containing regions of homology to the chromosomal site where it will be inserted. The CORE cassette is integrated via homologous recombination. Cells containing the CORE cassette can be selected for using the reporter gene and can be further confirmed using the counterselectable marker. Integration of the CORE cassette in the correct chromosomal location can be verified via PCR using primers that anneal upstream of the integration site, within the CORE and downstream of the integration size, which are designed to generate 500–1500 bp fragments. CORE-containing yeast cells are transformed with oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation such that they lead to the loss of the CORE cassette during homologous recombination. Transformants are selected using the counterselectable marker and can be further screened using the reporter gene. Sequencing is used to ensure the correct mutation has been generated without additional mutations. Alternatively, if the mutation leads to the generation or loss of a restriction site, PCR followed by restriction digest can be used to confirm that the desired mutation has been integrated. = Double-strand break (DSB) mediated delitto perfetto = To increase oligonucleotide targeting to the CORE cassette, CORE cassettes containing the GAL1-I-SceI feature can be used. This feature allows for the expression of SceI, an endonuclease that recognizes a highly unique 18 nucleotide sequence unlikely to occur anywhere else in the S. cerevisiae genome. The SceI endonuclease is able to generate a DSB at the SceI site leading to the recruitment of the DNA repair machinery.Storici F., Resnick MA. (2003) Delitto perfetto targeted mutagenesis in yeast with oligonucleotides. Genet Eng. 25:189-207 This increases the frequency of targeted homologous recombination by 4,000 fold compared to when no DSB is generated. General considerations for oligonucleotide design 80–100 bp oligonucleotides can be generated as single molecules, or pairs of oligonucleotides that are completely overlapping or partially overlapping. The type of oligonucleotide recommended depends on the type of mutation and the distance from the CORE cassette integration site a mutation is desired. Longer oligonucleotides lead to increased transformation efficiency. Fully complementary oligonucleotides pairs lead to 5–10 fold increase in efficiency compared to single oligonucleotides and are recommended for all applications. However, they provide a small window of mutagenesis of only 20–40 bases from the CORE cassette. To increase the window of mutagenesis, oligonucleotide pairs with a 20 bp overlap can be used, and these allow up to 100 bp upstream and downstream of the CORE integration site to be targeted. However, they transform approximately 6 times less efficiently. To increase the efficiency, partly overlapping oligonucleotides can be extended in vitro. = For gene deletions = Oligonucleotides containing the sequence upstream immediately followed by the sequence downstream of the region to be knocked out are designed. For gene deletions, pairs of fully overlapping 80–100 bp oligonucleotides lead to 5–10 fold increase in transformation efficiency than single oligonucleotides. = For point mutations = For mutations 20 to 40 bp from the CORE cassette, 80–100 bp fully overlapping oligonucleotides are recommended. For mutations more than 40 bp from the CORE cassette, partly overlapping oligonucleotides must be used. To increase their transformation efficiency, it is recommended that partly overlapping oligonucleotides be extended in vitro. = For essential genes = To generate mutants of essential genes, the CORE cassette can be inserted downstream of the gene of interest, however this limits the regions of the gene available for mutation. Alternatively, diploid cells can be used. However, using a diploid decreases the efficiency of oligonucleotide targeting due to the presence of two suitable chromosomal locations for the oligonucleotides to recombine. To address this drawback, the DSB-mediated delitto perfetto method can be used. This increases the frequency of targeted homologous recombination by 700 fold compared to when no DSB is generated. Moreover, it is 2–5 fold more efficient than other available methods.Storici F., Lewis LK., Resnick MA. (2001) In vivo site-directed mutagenesis using oligonucleotides. Nat Biotechnol. 19(8):773-6 Background mutation rates It is reported that when no double stranded breaks are generated, the number of cells that lose the CORE cassette in the absence of a targeting oligonucleotide is less than one transformant per 107 viable cells. In contrast, this number increases up to 100 transformants per 107 viable cells when a double stranded break is generated. In a diploid, the increased background mutation rates occur due to homologous recombination with the homologous chromosome decreasing targeted transformation events to only 4% of the total transformants.

Four worlds have been released so far. World 1 was released on March 14, 2006 and World 2 was released on January 9, 2008. After the 2009 Comic-Con, Borne announced he would officially start working on World 3. It was released on April 5, 2012. A console version developed by Borne and Over the Top Games was released by EA 2D for PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade on April 19 and April 20, 2011, respectively. An iOS version developed by Chillingo, Over the Top Games and Borne Games was released on the Apple App Store on March 4, 2012. Some years later, Brad Borne made a fourth entry, Super Fancy Pants Adventures, and it implies in its ending scene after defeating the final boss that it's: ”To be continued“. Two years after the release of the game, Brad posted World 4 on Newgrounds. World 4 was Super Fancy Pants Adventures, just ported to Adobe Flash. Right now, there are two parts of the game available on Newgrounds. Gameplay Fancy Pants Adventures features Fancy Pants Man as the playable character of the series. He is a two dimensional teenage stick figure with spiky, choppy hair, wearing only a pair of colored triangular-shaped pants, hence his name. His gameplay is similar to the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise, in which it utilizes momentum-based platforming with running as a major gameplay mechanic. More references to the Sonic the Hedgehog series is how some the level design (like the \\"S-Tubes\\") is centered around momentum, increasing momentum by rolling down a slope, and how the collectables are essential to the player's health besides providing an extra life for every hundred collected. Similar to Sonic, you can lose collectables, here called \\"squiggles\\", whenever you take damage, but in contrast you only lose 5% of your health and total collection of the squiggles. Another video game reference is from Nintendo's Mario video game series, with a box that can be jumped at from beneath to release several squiggles, and the source code referring to the squiggles as \\"coins\\". Fancy Pants Man's home is Squiggleville, a small country town run by the Mayor (first introduced in World 2). The mayor is introduced more in World 3. Players guide Fancy Pants Man through open levels which feature obstacles to overcome and enemies to avoid or defeat. These enemies include spiders, snails, and mice armed with guns. Enemies can be defeated by being jumped upon and crushed by Fancy Pants Man, who can also launch off them to perform an augmented leap. World 2 introduced the snail enemy, which retracts into its shell when jumped on, after which it can be kicked to stun other enemies. Originally the snail shell was merely a novelty feature in the World 2 demo; however, during development, BETA testers made a game out of getting the snail shell to hard-to-reach spots. Brad used this as inspiration to incorporate \\"Snail Shell Golf\\" which adds replayability to World 2 by allowing the player to gain access to different colored pants for the playable character. It is possible to earn a combo by keeping the snail shell in the air. Both worlds of Fancy Pants Adventures contain different kinds of small trophies that can be collected while playing the game. At the end of each world of Fancy Pants Adventures players fight a boss. In World 1 the boss is an angry penguin, who Fancy Pants Man accidentally falls upon and wakes from sleeping. This is the extent of the story in World 1, while World 2 has a more significant plotline. In World 2, an angry rabbit steals Fancy Pants Man's ice cream. Players must pursue and ultimately defeat the rabbit in a confrontation at the end of the game in order to reclaim the ice cream. In World 3, his sister, Cutie Pants, is kidnapped by pirates because she defeats their captain. They then make her their new captain. The first time Fancy Pants tries to bring her back, she doesn't want to leave, and has assumed the role of \\"Princess Pirate\\". The second time, though, she agrees to come home, because she saw ninjas, and pirates hate ninjas. A secret move, the wall jump, was obtainable in World 1, level 1 as a secret power-up from a pit that the player travels down through a cardboard box, and was noted by Borne that it was still a work in progress. Soon after obtaining the wall jump, the player had to employ the uses of it straight away to avoid an inevitable death from the slowly filling pit of ink. The wall jump became an official move available in World 2's increasing repertoire of moves. This was first shown in a demo that was made available by Borne on Newgrounds on March 13, 2007. In World 3, he gains Borne's pencil, which he uses like a sword. In The Fancy Pants Adventures for consoles, there are a few new additions to the gameplay. These include the ability to swim, which includes being able to kick off flat surfaces while underwater, and the ability to use a weapon later on in the game, which features a chargeable attack. The game features a main story mode, in which the player must save his sister, Cutie Pants, who has been kidnapped by a band of pirates who make her their captain. Each level contains two bonus rooms, a 'Micro-Trial', in which players must quickly chase a line of yellow squiggles, and stars, which unlock extra content, including remakes of the first two worlds. The game also features local and online multiplayer for up to four players, as well as various challenges. Playing through the game allows the player to unlock hats, pants, and weapons to customize their character's appearance. =Menus= The menus for each game are interactive, i.e., users control Fancy Pants Man through themselves exactly like in-game levels. The menus contain boxes of which jumped on from beneath to change the pants colors, or to view collected trophies, as well as links to Brad Borne's site and Armor Games's site. They also serve as level selectors for the game. The player starts World 1 in a dark corridor, then enters the menu through a door. In World 2, before the menu appears, the opening credits and the Armor Games logo scrolls up, with the option to skip the credits. The menu opens with instructions at the top- left hand corner of the screen. In World 3 , it starts with Fancy Pants Man in his bed when suddenly the mayor comes and talks to him. Then Fancy Pants Man jumps out of bed and training starts. In Super FPA, there are actually no menus. Instead, it starts in Fancy Pants Man's room after a storm deforms the landscape around him. To ascend to different levels, players have to pause the game and click the map that unlocks after beating the second boss. Development Fancy Pants Man (left) fights against Newgrounds mascot Pico (middle) and Alien Hominid in Newgrounds Rumble. The Fancy Pants Adventures series was created by Brad Borne, who had previously created games with the help of Mark Fleig Jr. Fleig provided all of the computer graphics on their collaborations. The previous games provided experience and allowed for more complex designs. Before using Macromedia Flash Borne had experimented with the TI-BASIC programming language on a TI-86 graphing calculator. His first involvement with Macromedia's software was stop motion animation. The stop motion experience was built upon with Flash's action script, used to create video games, which lead to further interest and ultimately Borne felt he \\"knew enough to make something that [he] thought was worth playing.\\" Despite not having a background in art, Borne created the graphics for Fancy Pants Adventures himself, resulting in the \\"sketchy\\" graphical style. The World 1 penguin boss was originally named \\"Pauly Penguin\\", and was created by one of Borne's friends, Paul Downs. After the release of World 1, Borne began freelancing, but stated in an interview that he views his own projects as a hobby, and that he doesn't \\"get as consumed by the process as much as [he] used to\\". According to Borne, \\"Trophies were [his] way of giving a nod to a few Flash artists whose work [he] really enjoyed.\\" In World 1, these trophies are located within standard levels, or at the end of a simple level. Several trophies from World 1 represent Borne's own works in progress. In World 2, however, the developer worked directly with the artist each trophy represented in order to design a unique level for obtaining that trophy. Bornegames is the hub for Borne's work and blog, which quickly became an integral part of the beta testing process. With new betas being released on a regular basis that no other websites had, players visiting the site act as beta testers and report software bugs. It became the central hub for the latest bug-fixes and beta news. Borne has also used his blog to post question and answer videos to reply to questions sent in by fans, he has also posted a \\"Behind the Fancy Pants\\" video as well as an \\"Official Snailshell Golf Guide\\". In May 2008 Borne completed a Fancy Pants Man move set and character design for the fighting game Newgrounds Rumble. In Newgrounds Rumble, Fancy Pants Man was supposedly invited for free ice cream in the Newgrounds world until he finds out that it was a setup for revenge by the other characters in the Newgrounds universe. Newgrounds didn't appreciate \\"kiddy\\" games unlike killing, shooting, violent, etc. games. Fancy later fights characters like S'asshole, Hank, P-bot, Nene, and the Newgrounds mascot Pico. During the Pico and Nene stage, Pico's rival Piconjo joins Fancy's side. Fancy later tries to find whose idea was the setup. =World 1= World 1 was the first installment in the Fancy Pants Adventure series. It was created by Brad Borne, and released March 14, 2006. It is a platforming game that is focused on speed and momentum. World 1 also introduces various trophies, side goals (squiggles and stars), and a variety of colors and styles of pants for the player to try on. The music in the game is composed by Geier Arnold. World 1 does not seem to have a plot, other than Fancy Pants Man running around the world and accidentally waking an angry penguin from his nap. =World 2= This is the second installment to the Fancy Pants Adventure series. It was released on January 9, 2008. This installment included new moves along with more trophies, pant colors, and bonus stages for the player to discover. Story The story begins with Fancy Pants Man playing a game of Snail Shell Golf. Upon completing the mini game, the Mayor of Squiggleville appears to reward Fancy Pants Man with an ice cream cone. Before he can enjoy his reward, an angry rabbit appears and steals the ice cream cone from Fancy Pants Man. The mayor informs Fancy Pants Man that he must retrieve the ice cream; \\"for the sake of humanity, justice, and so that World 2 will have a significant plot line,\\". He then dives into the golf hole after the rabbit. After beating all 6 Levels and 6 Extra Levels (each dedicated to a person who helped Brad Borne in the game's making), Fancy Pants Man enters The Angry Rabbit's Rabbitty Hideout (a possible reference to the Parthenon). The two soon engage in a boss fight. During the fight, the angry Rabbit will sometimes drop down spiders and one snail. The snail can be used as a method of attack to stun him.After the rabbit's defeat, Fancy Pants Man is finally able to retrieve his ice cream. =World 3= The third installment of The Fancy Pants Adventures was released on April 5, 2012. A beta edition was available before release at bornegames.com for anyone to test out. There also is a new character in this game and new enemies. In this installment, Fancy Pants Man's little sister, Cutie Pants Girl, is kidnapped and Fancy Pants Man has to save her. World 3 introduces new elements to the series including swimming, combat through the use of a sword-like pencil, improved animations, new moves like a wall kick and new enemies. World 3 was also released for iOS devices on March 4, 2012 and for Android on May 22, 2017. = World 1 Remix = The remake of The Fancy Pants Adventures World 1, released on May 14, 2014, introduced the AS3 engine into the series. It adds a fourth level into the game, along with a new boss: The Pencil (or Brad Borne). It also added hats, from the console version, and pants patterns (also with colors). The game introduces purchasable keys, called Fancy Keys, to support the development of The Fancy Pants Adventures. A normal key will unlock all key doors in the Remix, while the Fancy Key and higher acts as a Season Pass and unlocks key doors in the Remix and any future worlds. Much like World 1, there's isn't much of a plot. However, Brad Borne; in the form of a giant pencil makes his random appearances in the game. He appears in Level 3, where he destroys it after saying \\"Meh, no one ever liked Level 3...\\", and appears as the boss, using his pencil to try and defeat the player. =The Fancy Pants Adventures (Console)= On November 10, 2010, series creator Brad Borne released a video on his website and on YouTube announcing a home console version of The Fancy Pants Adventures for Xbox Live Arcade and PlayStation Network. The game was a collaboration between Borne Games and development studio Over the Top Games, and was published by Electronic Arts, under the company's EA2D label.http://www.fancypantsadventures.com New features include a two to four player mode and a brand new set of levels, as well as World's 1 and 2. The game was released on April 19, 2011 for PlayStation Network and April 20, 2011 for Xbox Live Arcade. Borne explained in an FAQ on his website that the console game is not World 3, but World 3 is something of a devolution of the console game.

It is a story of Londoners connected by family, friends and a certain therapist who brings all her patients’ problems back to their mothers. Lives start to unravel during an eventful dinner party where the cook spoils the food, a coke-headed model flirts with a married vicar, a secret affair is exposed, old family wounds are reopened and one meddling mother drops by to cause even more trouble. Plot Lives start to unravel during an eventful dinner party when the group are forced to face their issues head on. For one couple, vicar Dan (David Conolly) and his wife Emma (Joanna Pecover) are faced with the revelation that one of them has been having an affair with the evening’s hostess Kate (Miranda Hart). Worst of all she has to in turn face her mother (Joan Blackham) who drops in to “help out”. Drug-fueled sex, lustful longings and how to make cous-cous. Even the therapist (Alix Longman) has to face her own maternal misgivings as she returns home to deal with the aftermath of her own mother’s descent into Alzheimer’s. Nina (Caroline Burns Cooke) explores having to care for a sick mother who, when she was well, appeared not to care for either Nina or her sister.

Conolly’s unexpected unemployment meant a new ear to listen to the stories and a new eye for the structure of the screenplay. Eight actors were chosen for the film (including Hannah Davis's mother Jean Boht) and six months were spent devising and rehearsing the script. This was followed by intense periods of filming with breaks so that the cast and crew could earn money to keep them going also giving time for Conolly and Davis to earn enough to finance the next phase of production. Producer and best-selling novelist Lynda La Plante (of Prime Suspect, Trial & Retribution and Commander fame) saw a teaser for the movie and offered to become part of the post-production team and sign on as executive producer.

The church originally met in a leased facility. They then purchased and renovated one of four cinemas in Woolwich. The 3,000-member church occupies the former Coronet cinema complex and overlooks the Woolwich Ferry.  History of the building  The cinema was opened as the Odeon Theatre on 25 October 1937 with Ralph Reader in The Gang Show. It was designed for the Oscar Deutsch chain of Odeon Cinemas by architect George Cole who came up with a streamlined Art Deco style. Inside the auditorium there were troughs of concealed lighting and a moulded plaster decoration on the splay walls in the form of a floral frieze which had backlighting. Seating was provided for 1,178 in the stalls and 650 in the balcony. It was modernised internally in May 1964, a process known as the Rank Organisation's \\"zing\\" treatment. It continued as the Odeon until closing on 17 October 1981. Independent film exhibitors Panton Films took over the building from 14 July 1983 and it reopened as the Coronet Cinema with Return of the Jedi. It was converted into a twin cinema from 6 July 1990 with seating for 678 in the former balcony and 360 seats in the former rear stalls. The Coronet was closed on 6 June 1999. It was taken over by the New Wine Church from 2001 and the building is now known as Gateway House which continues in church use today. The New Wine Church has made a number of alterations and renovations to the building. The building is a Grade II Listed Building and is currently used for (and is available for) weddings, music concerts, conferences, exercise classes and business meetings.  Global ministry  The church, with the assistance of its affiliate, New Wine Covenant Partners, has taken part in missionary activities in Australia, the Netherlands, India, Ivory Coast, Kenya, Malaysia, Nigeria, Norway, South Africa, Tanzania and the United States. Internationally, New Wine has built a housing estate of 55 homes for over 100 lepers in Chennai India. The estate also benefits from a full-time nurse, electricity, clean water, food and a chaplaincy.http://www.miracleministry.org/lepercolony.html The Church also funds a water project in Zambia, providing boreholes for 10 villages. They run an Operation Christmas child campaign which provides shoe boxes filled with gifts for Eastern European children.  Previous Senior Pastors & Borough Deans  Dr Tayo Adeyemi (1993 - 2013) and Pastor Michael Olawore (2013 - 2018) were previous Senior Pastors of the Church. One of the seven Ecumenical Borough Deans in Greenwich was Minister Olu Ajanaku, formerly a Minister at New Wine Church; he represented the Black majority churches. EBDs are representatives of Christian churches to local government in London. Mr David Chick took over this role in January 2015 and represents the Black-led churches.

The peptides are cationic, generally lack a stable conformation in water but form amphipathic α-helix in membranes; their mechanism against micro-organisms is unclear but they disrupt the cell membranes of a broad spectrum of bacteria, protozoa, and fungi. They were independently discovered at around the same time by the labs of Michael Zasloff at the NIH and Dudley H. Williams at the University of Cambridge. They were named by Zasloff, after the Hebrew word for \\"shield,\\" מגן māgēn (Ashkenazi pronunciation: magain).Interviewed in 1987, Zasloff explained: \\"I used it because it came from the skin and it was shielding, in my opinion.

Histatin's involvement in antimicrobial activities makes histatin part of the Innate immune system. Histatin was first discovered (isolated) in 1988, with functions that's responsible in keeping homeostasis inside the oral cavity, helping in the formation of pellicles, and assist in bonding of metal ions.  Structure  The structure of histatin is unique depending on whether the protein of interest is histatin 1, 3 or 5. Nonetheless, histatin mainly possess a cationic charge due to the primary structure consisting mostly of basic amino acids. An amino acid that is crucial to histatin's function is histidine. Studies show that the removal of histadine (especially in histatin 5) resulted in reduction of antifungal activity.  Function  Histatins are antimicrobial and antifungal proteins, and have been found to play a role in wound-closure. A significant source of histatins is found in the serous fluid secreted by Ebner's glands, salivary glands at the back of the tongue, and produced by Acinus cells. Here they offer some early defense against incoming microbes. The three major histatins are 1, 3, and 5, which contains 38, 32, and 24 amino acids, respectively. Histatin 2 is a degradation product of histatin 1, and all other histatins are degradation products of histatin 3 through the process of post-translational proteolysis of the HTN3 gene. Therefore there are only two genes, HTN1 and HTN3. Histatin 5 N-terminus allows it to bind with metals because of its highly reactive nature. It's been shown that this chemical nature allows the precipitate of reactive oxygen species. Histatin's antifungal properties has been seen with fungus such as Candida glabrata, Candida krusei, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Cryptococcus neoformans. Histatins also precipitate tannins from solution - thus preventing alimentary adsorption. Histatin's anti-fungal property works by the release of the fungal's intracellular component through the disruption of the fungus plasma membrane. They also work against yeast, by binding to the potassium transporter and facilitating in the loss of azole-resistant species.

They were first isolated from the hemolymph of Hyalophora cecropia, whence the term cecropin was derived. Cecropins lyse bacterial cell membranes; they also inhibit proline uptake and cause leaky membranes. Cecropins constitute a main part of the innate immune system of insects. Cecropins are small proteins anywhere from 31 - 37 amino acids long and are active against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Cecropins isolated from insects other than Hyalophora cecropia (Cecropia moth) have been given various names; bactericidin, lepidopterin, sarcotoxin, etc. All of these are structurally related Members Members include : ;Cecropin A: Peptide Sequence (KWKLFKKIEKVGQNIRDGIIKAGPAVAVVGQATQIAK). Secondary structure includes two α helices. At low peptide to lipid ratios ion channels are formed, at high peptide to lipid ratios pores are formed. ;Cecropin B: Peptide Sequence (KWKVFKKIEKMGRNIRNGIVKAGPAIAVLGEAKAL). Secondary structure includes two α helices. ;CECD: from Aedes aegypti (Yellowfever mosquito).cecropin family OPM ;Papiliocin: from Papilio xuthus (a butterfly) ;Cecropin P1: Peptide Sequence (SWLSKTAKKLENSAKKRISEGIAIAIQGGPR). An antibacterial peptide from Ascaris suum, a parasitic nematode that resides in the pig intestine, also belongs to this family. Derivatives A derivative of Cecropin B is an anticancer polypeptide(L). Structure consists of mainly alpha helixes, determined by solution NMR. Protein molecular weight = 4203.4g/mol.; Some of the cecropins (e.g. cecropin A, and cecropin B) have anticancer properties and are called anticancer peptides (ACPs). Hybrid ACPs based on Cecropin A have been studied for anticancer properties. Anticancer properties Anticancer activities of cecropin B, cecropin P1, and Shiva-1 were first demonstrated with in vitro studies of mammalian leukemia and lymphoma cell lines, where cells were sensitive to peptide concentrations on the order of 10−6 M. Two multidrug- resistant breast and ovarian cancer cell lines also showed sensitivity to the peptides. Further, peptide anticancer activity is reported as being complete within one hour of treatment. In vivo studies of murine ascitic colon adenocarcinoma cells showed a similar trend, where mice treated with cecropin B exhibited increased survival time compared to untreated mice. Structural studies of cecropin B and its derivative cecropin B3 showed that anticancer activity arises from the ability of the antimicrobial peptides to form pores in stomach carcinoma cell membranes. Measuring electrical currents on cell surfaces showed that cecropin B, but not cecropin B3, induces outward currents indicative of pore formation. Further, cecropin B3 lacks an amphipathic group present in cecropin B, suggesting that this amphipathic group is necessary for cecropin B to insert into cell membranes and form pores. Cecropin B has strong activity on bacteria as well as cancer cells, while B3 has little effect on either. Notably, another derivative, cecropin B1, has two amphipathic regions and exhibits potent activity against human leukemia cell lines at concentrations that do not affect normal fibroblasts or red blood cells. Different cecropins act on different types of human cancer cells and show activity at concentrations that are not harmful to normal cells. For example, a recent study of Cecropins A and B demonstrated strongly cytotoxic activity against four bladder cancer cell lines, while benign murine and human fibroblasts were not susceptible to Cecropin A or B. Cecropins from many insect species have been shown to be active against a diverse range of human cancer cell lines. For example, Mdcec, a cecropin originating from the common housefly, has been shown to have an antiproliferative effect on human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line BEL-7402 without affecting normal liver cells. Flow cytometry and RT-PCR experiments revealed that treatment with Mdcec increased expression of pro-apoptotic genes such as caspase-3, leading to cancer cell death. These same genes did not show significant expression changes in healthy cells upon treatment with Mdcec. This suggests a degree of specificity which has promise for development of novel cancer therapies. Further supporting therapeutic efficacy, a study of cecropin A affirmed that cecropin A selectively lyses leukemia cells while exerting little effect on normal lymphocytes. In the same study, chemotherapy drugs cytarabine and 5-fluorouracil synergize with cecropin A in vitro to enhance cytotoxic effects on leukemia cells. This indicates potential for therapeutic application of antimicrobial peptides in cancer, where treatment with cecropins could lower the required dosage of chemotherapy drugs, reducing undesirable side effects. Major challenges to the use of cecropins as cancer therapeutics are delivery of the peptides to tumor cells. Repeated administration of peptides is necessary to maintain systemic levels of cecropins at sufficient concentrations for anti-cancer activity. This need for repeated administration complicates potential treatment plans. One proposed alternative suggests use of gene therapy to introduce cecropin genes into cancer cells. A study in which cecropin genes were expressed in a human bladder carcinoma cell line showed that tumor cells bearing cecropin genes have reduced tumorigenicity, up to complete loss of tumorigenicity in some cell clones. More recent studies have identified new cecropins, which may be prove useful in development of cancer therapeutics. For example, genome and transcriptome analyses of the spruce budworm Choristoneura fumiferana resulted in identification of novel cecropins which differ from previously characterized cecropins in that they are negatively charged, rather than positively charged. A BH3-like motif (amino acid sequence G-[KQR]-[HKQNR]-[IV]-[KQR]) is present in both anionic and cationic cecropins, and analysis suggests that this motif may interact with Bcl-2, a protein implicated in apoptosis. Further study of cecropin structure and anticancer properties may inform design of novel cancer therapeutics. Antibiofilm properties Cecropin A can destroy planktonic and sessile biofilm-forming uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) cells, either alone or when combined with the antibiotic nalidixic acid, synergistically clearing infection in vivo (in the insect host Galleria mellonella) without off-target cytotoxicity. The multi-target mechanism of action involves outer membrane permeabilization followed by biofilm disruption triggered by the inhibition of efflux pump activity and interactions with extracellular and intracellular nucleic acids.>  References  Further reading  * Hoskin 2008 (above) section 4.2  External links  * Cecropins.

Understanding Politics: The Cultures of Societies and the Structures of Governments.\\"Corporatism: A Daring Dream, Part I\\". is a corporatist political culture that is distinct from fascist corporatism in that rather than having a dictatorship impose order through force, the Tory corporatist culture is organic, already settled and ongoing. The Tory corporatist culture relies on existing shared values of its members and therefore does not feature a large police force. The theoretical source of legitimacy of a Tory corporatist culture is tradition and hierarchy. While its members are rational beings, the culture itself does not attempt to justify itself by reason as for instance a fascist corporatist culture does, but rather appeals to the way it has always been done. Tory corporatists feel that tradition is the rightful basis of society. The Tory corporatist culture is organized with rigid hierarchy defined by social class and age. Tory corporatists view this hierarchy as fundamental to the proper functioning of the society. They do not value or seek to achieve equality because they believe it is an illusion and detrimental. Any power attained by those who seek equality is considered an illegitimate replacement. Merit does play a limited role in who has influence, but hierarchy of birth takes precedence over merit whenever there is a conflict between the two. The Tory corporate culture is based on the family. Small corporate groups as well as the whole society are seen as a big family. For this reason, Tory corporatists tend to view time and goals in terms longer than one's own lifetime. Specialization of skills by small corporate groups tend to perpetuate the culture because it causes members to feel a sense of self-government and self-sufficiency. The connection of their work to the purpose of the whole society is close and obvious. Tory corporate cultures are conceived in cooperation, not competition. Members accept the hierarchy and ownership is not vested in individuals, but rather groups. The good of these groups is believed to be the same as the good of the whole society.

He is known for his work on the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) in Africa, where he served as mission president when the 1978 Revelation on Priesthood was announced and compiled hundreds of interviews from African locals. Biography LeBaron was born in Taber, Alberta, Canada but grew up in nearby Barnwell, Alberta. As a young man, he served as an LDS missionary in South Africa and Zimbabwe from 1955 to 1958. Receiving his B.A., M.S., and Ed.D. from BYU, LeBaron worked as a teacher and administrator for the Church Educational System in Alberta, Wyoming, and Utah. In 1972 he returned to Africa to organize LDS Seminaries and Institutes of Religion in South Africa. Following that assignment he was called as president of the South Africa Johannesburg Mission from 1976 to 1979. LeBaron was still serving as Mission President when the LDS Church announced the 1978 Revelation on Priesthood, which extended the priesthood to black people, the missionary work under LeBaron expanded dramatically. LeBaron also took other leadership roles in the LDS church as a bishop, high councilor, and stake president. On 3 December 2009, LeBaron died from injuries after being struck by an automobile not far from his home. Professional career Funding was approved through the David M. Kennedy Center for International Studies at BYU for LeBaron to conduct interviews and collect oral histories and other documentation on the account of Africans in the LDS Church. He collected oral history interviews in about ten countries — South Africa, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Nigeria, Zaire, Ciskei, Transkei, Swaziland, and the island nations of Mauritius and Reunion — to preserve knowledge of the beginnings of the LDS Church there. LeBaron collected more than 650 oral histories of African converts from 24 African nations. He gave presentations on the information he gathered and compiled a DVD of his interview experiences entitled Pioneers of Africa. He authored a book, All Are Alike Unto God, on African conversions. The book contained interviews with 23 black converts from South Africa, Zimbabwe, Nigeria, Ghana and Zaire, which were the first African countries to receive LDS missionaries. After his work in Africa, LeBaron returned to his role as a professor of religion at BYU where he lectured from 1986 until 2001. Besides various publications relating to the LDS Church in Africa, LeBaron has also written a biography of Benjamin F. Johnson's life and edited a biography of Glen G.

The story follows twelve-year-old Jeremy Fink and his neighbor Lizzy Muldoun as they attempt to retrieve four keys that unlock a wooden box delivered one month before Jeremy's 13th birthday. The novel contains information that provides a connection to Every Soul a Star, a children's novel also by Wendy Mass. An independent film adaptation of the novel, starring Maxwell Beer as Jeremy Fink and Ryan Simpkins as Lizzy Muldoun, was released in 2012. Writer/director Tamar Halpern adapted the book and directed along with Jamar Crawford. Plot summary One month before his thirteenth birthday, Jeremy Fink and his best friend Lizzy Muldoun were out in his New York City apartment when the mailman delivers a package addressed to Jeremy's mom. Lizzy convinces him to open the package. Inside the package, they discover a wooden box with four keyholes and the words, \\"THE MEANING OF LIFE: FOR JEREMY FINK TO OPEN ON HIS 13TH BIRTHDAY.\\" Jeremy immediately recognizes the box as the work of his father, who died five years earlier in a car crash. An accompanying note explains that the friend taking care of the box lost all of the keys. Determined to open the box, Jeremy and Lizzy contact a locksmith who explains that he is unable to pick the locks or break the box open without destroying the box and possibly its contents. The two friends set a goal to find the keys by the end of the summer so Jeremy can still open the box on his thirteenth birthday. Lizzy's impulsiveness gets the duo into trouble for destroying property and they must spend the summer performing community service. Jeremy and Lizzy are assigned to work for Mr. Oswald, an antique dealer preparing to retire to Florida, who sends them to deliver some special antiques. Once the first house is reached, the children realize they are returning items to the original owners, people who pawned these items when only teenagers. Each item is being returned with the original letter stating why the owner chose to pawn the items. The people Jeremy meets help him learn important lessons about life by sharing their views. While doing community service they must find all of the keys they can, continuously worrying about the performance they must do at a fair due to losing a bet to Jeremy's grandmother. It is only in the end that Jeremy truly understands the meaning of life when he opens the box. Reception Publishers Weekly described Jeremy Fink and the Meaning of Life as a \\"meaningless novel\\" not to be missed, saying that much of \\"the novel's charm derives from Jeremy and Lizzy's unique friendship\\". BookPage described it as \\"a moving, hilarious and altogether engaging tale of self-discovery\\". Film adaptation Fink Films, in association with Kidzhouse Entertainment, released a film adaptation in 2011. Tamar Halpern wrote and directed the screenplay, and the film starred Mira Sorvino, Joe Pantoliano, Maxwell Beer and Ryan Simpkins as the eponymous Jeremy Fink and his best friend, Lizzy Muldoun.

He was the head coach at Cal State Northridge from 1989 to 1995 and at Cal State Bakersfield from 2009 to 2015. Other coaching positions as an assistant included North Carolina State (2001-2), Cal State Fullerton (1977-82, 1987, 2006-7), University of Illinois (1988) and Sacramento State (2019). Early life and education Born in Boise, Idaho, Kernen graduated from San Gorgonio High School in San Bernardino, California and started his college baseball playing career in 1966 at University of Redlands. A four-year letterman for the Bulldogs, Kernen had a successful playing career as a pitcher. In 1970, his senior season, he won 11 games with a 1.26 ERA in 106 innings, earning him first-team all-conference, All-NAIA and Player of the Year honors from the SCIAC. Was named Student Athlete of the Year 1970 at University of Redlands. Kernen completed his bachelor's degree cum laude in psychology at University of Redlands in 1970. He played two seasons of minor league baseball with the Baltimore Orioles organization, first with the Aberdeen Pheasants in 1970 and Stockton Ports in 1971. Coaching careerHigh school and college assistant (1975–1988)= Kernen began his head coaching career for his alma mater, San Gorgonio High School, spending two years with the program from 1975 to 1976 before moving up to the junior college level as pitching coach at Orange Coast College in 1977. From 1977 to 1982 and again in 1987, Kernen was pitching coach at Cal State Fullerton under Augie Garrido. Kernen helped to turn the Titans into a perennial postseason contender winning the Big West Conference 5 straight seasons, including trips to the College World Series in 1979 and 1982, with the Titans winning the national championship in the 1979 season. During his time at Fullerton, he coached 14 pitchers who were selected by Major League Baseball in the amateur draft, four of whom reached the big leagues in Gary Buckles, Larry Casian, Jeff Robinson, and No. 1 draft pick Mike Harkey. Following his father's passing, Kernen left the Titans after the 1982 season to manage his family's business and returned to Cal State Fullerton for the 1987 season. In 1988, Kernen followed Garrido to Illinois. =Cal State Northridge (1989–1995)= Kernen's first major college head coaching position was at Cal State Northridge, where he led the Matadors from 1989 to 1995 in their transition from Division II to Division I. The Matadors, who had been successful at the Division II level, having won national titles in 1970 and 1984, transitioned to Division I under Kernen's auspices. 1990 was the last year of Division II play for the Matadors, and in this final year Kernen guided the team to the NCAA Division II College World Series title game. This effort earned Kernen the Division II West Region Coach of the Year honors. In 1991, the first year of Division I play for the Matadors, Kernen led CSUN to a 44–18–1 record, the West Regional championship game and a #10 ranking in the final NCAA Division I poll, only the second time in NCAA baseball history a first year team finished in the Top 10, the other being Augie Garrido's Cal State Fullerton team in 1975. In seven seasons with the Matadors, Kernen's record was 240–154–3. In August 1995, Kernen resigned from Cal State Northridge to pursue a career in theater in New York City. He studied dramatic writing at Columbia University in 1995 and 1996. At Cal State Northridge, several future college head coaches worked under Kernen. Rick Vanderhook, who was an assistant coach from 1989 to 1990, has been head coach at Cal State Fullerton since 2012. Jody Robinson, an assistant on the 1991 team, was head coach at Loyola Marymount from 1992 to 1996. Following one season on staff in 1992, Stan Sanchez has been head coach at Southern Colorado (now CSU–Pueblo) since 1993.ref name=\\"CSU Pueblo\\"> Mike Batesole, an assistant from 1994 to 1995, was head coach at Cal State Fullerton from 1996 to 2002 and has been head coach at Fresno State since 2003. =NC State and Cal State Fullerton assistant (2002–2007)= Kernen returned to coaching in the 2002 season, hired in September 2001 as pitching coach at NC State under Elliott Avent. He left a week before the 2003 season. In 2007, Kernen returned to Cal State Fullerton, this time as a volunteer assistant coach on a team that made the College World Series. =Cal State Bakersfield (2009–2015)= Cal State Bakersfield hired Kernen to be its inaugural baseball head coach in May 2007. He put together a roster of 25 for the program's debut season in 2008 entirely from freshmen and junior college transfers. In its debut season of 2009, Cal State Bakersfield defeated defending College World Series champions Fresno State three out of five times to become the first-ever first-year Division I baseball team to defeat a defending national champion. On March 7, 2011, Cal State Bakersfield received its first ever national ranking, at no. 30 on the Collegiate Baseball poll. After four seasons as a Division I independent, Cal State Bakersfield joined the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) beginning in the 2013 season and won the regular season title that year, for which Kernen won WAC Coach of the Year honors. On May 8, 2014, Kernen announced that he would retire after the season. Kernen reversed course three weeks later and decided to remain as head coach on a year-by-year basis. In his final season as head coach, Cal State Bakersfield made the NCAA Tournament and won the WAC Tournament title for the first time in program history. Cal State Bakersfield went 1–2 in the tournament, including a 2-1 win that eliminated 2014 College World Series participant Ole Miss from the tournament. On August 31, 2015, Cal State Bakersfield promoted assistant coach Bob Macaluso to be head coach. Macaluso went 19–37 in his only season as head coach before being fired in December 2016. During Kernen's seven seasons, Cal State Bakersfield went 197–198–1 and produced 15 players selected in the Major League Baseball Draft. Head coaching record Below is a table of Kernen's yearly records as an NCAA head baseball coach. Theatre career After coaching at Cal State Northridge, Kernen left college baseball to pursue a career in theatre and film. He was accepted into the dramatic writing program at Columbia University in New York City. As a playwright, Kernen produced multiple plays. In 1997, Kernen wrote and produced And Other Fairy Tales and A Graveyard Symphony; in the next years, Kernen followed these with the more ambitious Galleria degli Angeli (2001) and Musica de Mariposa (1999). And Other Fairy Tales was honored as a finalist in the Oglebay Institute National Playwriting Competition. Kernen produced, wrote and directed a short film in 2006, In the House of Athazagora. Following his retirement in 2015, Kernen returned to New York City to resume his theatre/film career. He is currently on pre-production for a feature film based on his play Galleria degli Angeli.

It has been considered for a period a cephalopod. However discoveries of more detailed fossils showed that Volborthella’s small, conical shell was not secreted but built from grains of the mineral silicon dioxide (silica), and that it was not divided into a series of compartments by septa as those of fossil shelled cephalopods and the living Nautilus are. This illusion was a result of the laminated texture of the organisms' tests. Therefore, Volborthella’s classification is now uncertain. It has been speculated that it may in fact represent a sclerite of a larger organism, on the basis of one specimen; however, it may be premature to accept this hypothesis, as the arrangement of sclerites producing this impression may have occurred by chance. The Ordovician scleritome-bearing Curviconophorus, as well as the Halwaxiids, lobopods and echinoderms, demonstrate the diversity of organisms which may produce a scleritome of this nature. The related Campitius was originally suggested to be part of a radula rather than a scleritome, but is now considered a synonym of Volborthella. Volborthella is widespread, and a useful biostratigraphic indicator; it has been found in North America, Greenland, Spitsbergen, and northeastern Europe, and is restricted to Lower Cambrian rocks, appearing before the trilobites and co-existing with them for some time. Volborthella has been described as a 'failed attempt in mineralisation'; it constructed its wall by agglutinating grains of sediment, much like some foramanifera, and declined in conjunction with the origin of truly-biomineralising organisms. However, its similarity to Salterella, which contained embedded sediment grains in its mineralised wall, suggests a possible biological relationship - Salterella may have begun to mineralise its agglutinated wall. Some Volborthella specimens do show taphonomic hints that some form of lightly mineralised sheath may have enclosed its agglutinated shell.

The battle was of defensive nature, as the Romanian Army was joined by a part of the Imperial Russian army. The Romanian Army, led by General Constantin Prezan, had previously been unable to stop the German counterattack in Muntenia. The armed forces that made up the German counterattack were mostly German, two armed groups attacking concentrically, one from the direction of Oltenia and the other from the south of the Danube. The sheer number of troops involved, as well as the large area of operations, make it one of the most complex battles fought on Romanian soil during the war. The battle took place between 13 December and 16 December 1916. At the same time, between 14 December and 19 December 1916, the battle of Argeș took place. There, the Bulgarian and German armies led by General August von Mackensen reported a glorious victory. The outcome of the two battles was Bucharest being occupied on 19 December by the Central Powers and the Romanian and Russian forces' retreat to Moldavia, all the way to the Siret.  Background  On 27 November 1916, three main events took place which enabled the Central Powers to commence the offensive towards Bucharest: following a successful holding action at Slatina, the Romanians abandoned the line of the Olt River,John Buchan, T. Nelson, 1922, A History of the Great War: From the battle of Verdun to the third battle of Ypres, p. 249 the German 9th Army and Mackensen's Danube Army had linked up,Prit Buttar, Bloomsbury Publishing, Sep 22, 2016, Russia's Last Gasp: The Eastern Front 1916–17, p. 378 and the Danube had been secured by the Bulgarian capture of Giurgiu.Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania, p. 267  Commanders  The Romanian and Russian forces, made up of approximately 150.000 men, were led by General Constantin Prezan, while the Central Powers' armed forces were led by General August von Mackensen and Erich von Falkenhayn. Following a series of losses on the Romanian Army's side in Oltenia and Muntenia, the political authorities decided to appoint General Constantin Prezan commander of Army 1, with the immediate objective of organizing the defense of Bucharest. \\"Through a Supreme Order you are temporarily named commander of Army 1. As such, we ask of you report tomorrow, 10 November, at 10:30 A.M. at the General Quarters. You shall take Captain Antonescu Ion with you from the North Army.\\"*** (1996). Marele Cartier General al Armatei României. Documente 1916–1920, București: Ed. Machiavelli, p. 153  The strategy  In spite of the disastrous strategic situation that he was presented with, Prezan, alongside of the leader of the newly arrived French military mission to Romania, General Henri Berthelot, elaborate a plan of operations that involved a surprise flanking maneuver at the division between Mackensen's armed forces and Kühne's. That division referred to a 20-kilometer area between the German forces' two groups of combatants. Prezan ordered a concentrated attack made up of seven divisions against Mackensen's group. Divisions 18 and 21 attacked frontally to pin the German forces down, while Divisions 2/5, 9/19 Infantry and Division 2 Cavalry attacked the exposed left flank of Mackensen's group. At the same time, two newly arrived Russian divisions, Cavalry 8 and Infantry 40 attacked the left flank.Glen Torrey (1999). Romania and World War I: A Collection of Studies, Center for Romanian Studies, Portland, pp. 246–250  The battle  The conduct of military actions Operations in Romania, November 1916 to January 1917 =Prelude (28-30 November)= On 28 November, the German 217th Division was halted at Prunaru, despite the Romanians incurring casualties amounting to 700 prisoners and 20 guns. Although the 217th moved some battalions to Naipu, these were checked by Prezan's maneuver group within two days. The left flank of the Danube Army had thus been exposed.Michael B.

Romanian forces captured thousands of prisoners and significant quantities of material during this counter-offensive.Charles Clark (1971). United , New York: Arno Press, p. 154 German General Erich Ludendorff considered the situation to be very serious: \\"On 1 December the left flank of the Danube Army was very powerfully attacked southwest of Bucharest and pushed back. The German troops who crossed the Neajlov were cut off and isolated. The situation most certainly became very critical.\\"Erich Ludendorff, My War Memories 1914-1918, Naval & Military Press, 2001, , pp 299-300 Only the last-minute intervention of the 26th Turkish Infantry Division on 2 December saved Mackensen's group from encirclement. The Romanians suffered a considerable setback when a staff car carrying attack plans accidentally drove into a German position and was captured.Burg & Purcell 2004, p. 146. These plans were vital to the Germans. As various developments took place, (General Culcer's \\"betrayal\\", the lack of involvement on the part of the Russian armed forces), the German, Bulgarian and Turkish forces, by taking advantage of their superior numbers, soon managed to recover and push back the Romanian forces, leaving the way to the capital open. Thus, on 6 December 1916, the German troops entered Bucharest and occupied it. In the end, the Romanian Government and the Romanian armed forces were forced to retreat to Moldavia. Even though the Battle for Bucharest was lost, it only served as a tactical defeat in the end, as the Central Powers failed their strategic goal of eliminating Romania from the war. The Battle for Bucharest is considered to be the most complex military operation undertaken by the Romanian Army in 1916, both because of the number of men involved and because of its length, as well as because of the length of its front line. Aftermath After the battle, minor actions were fought in the fortifications surrounding Bucharest between the invading Germans and the Romanian reserves which had failed to arrive due to the actions of , a subordinate of Constantin Prezan and a naturalized German. The city was eventually occupied by the Central Powers on 6 December. However, in spite of the human, material and military efforts made by the Central Powers throughout this period, they failed to achieve their fundamental political and strategic goal, namely Romania's defeat and her getting out of the war. Despite heavy casualties, some 250,000 men, which were almost one third of the manpower mobilized in August 1916, and losses of combat material, the Romanian Army was still a force taken into consideration by allies and enemies alike and capable to offer resistance to further attacks. Before retreating, Romanian troops burned down the oil wells at Ploiești along with the surrounding wheat fields so as to keep them out of the hands of the Central Powers. Bucharest was eventually liberated after the Central Powers' surrender in 1918.

Life Born at Uppingham, Rutland, in 1626, he was a son of John Clerke, master of the school there. In 1641 he was admitted to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, and there he proceeded M.A., being elected a fellow in 1648. In 1651 he received presbyterian ordination; he became proctor also in the next year, 1652; but in 1655 he resigned his fellowship and left the university, because the statutes required him to take the degree of Bachelor of Divinity, and his conscientious scruples made this impossible. His ability brought him into communication with Richard Cumberland, his contemporary at Cambridge, and with William Whiston; but, inheriting a small property at Loddington, Northamptonshire, he quietly pursued his mathematical studies in that county to the end of his life. He did approach Isaac Newton for some clarification of the Principia.Niccolò Guicciardini, Reading the Principia: The Debate on Newton's Mathematical Methods for Natural Philosophy from 1687 to 1736 (2003), p. 175. His directions to find the meridian relate to observations taken at Stamford, where Whiston knew him. He laid out the gardens of Lamport Hall. The manner and the time of his death are not recorded. He is supposed to have died about 1697. Works In 1660 he issued his first work, De Plenitudine Mundi. In this he reviewed René Descartes and attacked Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, and Seth Ward. In the next year he was following the lines of Torricelli and Robert Boyle; and, dedicating the resulting work to Sir Justinian Isham, he brought it out in 1662 as Tractatus de Restitutione Corporum, which replied to Francis Line. Another work of his was Finalis Concordia, alluded to by him in some correspondence with Richard Baxter on church divisions. In 1682 he published his expansion of William Oughtred's Clavis Mathematica with the title Oughtredus explicatus, with part i. dedicated to Isham, part ii. to Sir Walter Chetwynd. In this work Clerke spoke of his invention of the spot-dial. He published his Description of it in 1687, this being the only work he wrote in English. In 1695 appeared Tractatus tres; quorum qui prior Ante-Nicenismus dicitur, a Unitarian answer to George Bull's Nicene writings, the first two of these being by Clerke and the third anonymous. He is credited with all three by some writers, while others take from him the two to which he put his name and attribute them all to Samuel Crellius (1661-1747).Robert Wallace, Anti- Trinitarian Biography iii. p. 485. Clerke's position as an original theologian is also questioned; it has been thought he merely reproduced Daniel Zwicker's arguments. Clerke did not suffer the fate of Socinians William Freke (1694) and John Smith (1695) who were forced to recant.

Born in Hemsworth, Hall began his career in journalism with the Newcastle Journal, but soon moved to London. By the age of 27 he became editor of the Sunday Graphic for a year,Douglas Martin, \\"Allan Hall, 71, Journalist Who Inspired Beaujolais Race\\", The New York Times, 3 May 2001 then in 1959 became managing editor of the News Chronicle. In 1960, both papers closed, and Hall began writing a gossip column for the Daily Herald.Michael Leapman, \\"Allan Hall\\", The Independent, 30 April 2001 Hall remained a columnist as the Herald became The Sun, but left in 1969 when Rupert Murdoch bought the paper. He joined the Sunday Times, where he launched a lifestyle section before taking over the \\"Atticus\\" diary column. Having long had an interest in wine, being known for spending long lunches in the Connaught Rooms, he convinced editor Harold Evans to launch the Sunday Times Wine Club. By now writing regularly about wine, Hall decided in 1972 to organize an annual race to bring Beaujolais Nouveau to Britain. This was replicating a private race by Clement Freud (Wine Correspondent for The Son) and Joseph Berkmann (agent for Georges Duboeuf) in 1970 and 1971. This race, became a reality in 1972, with a bottle of champagne up for grabs for the winner. This was collected by the first to arrive at The Sunday Times' offices having let themselves into the building. This was later replicated in other countries, and by the 1980s attracted widespread interest. The official Beaujolais Run® continues to this day www.beaujolaisrun.com. In 1980, Hall moved to work for James Goldsmith's magazine NOW!, during which time he hosted a lunch at which fine wines were served. For this one meal he claimed, and was paid, expenses of more than £11,000. The magazine closed the following year, after which Hall retired to Suffolk, selling wine and offering tasting sessions. He continued writing about wine on a freelance basis, and organized wine tours of France.

Heinrich Kirchweger was born on 12 June 1809 in Stettin, then part of Germany, now Szczecin in Poland. After attending the trade school in Berlin, Kirchweger worked with the industrialist Georg Henschel in Kassel. Career In 1838 he became the technical operations manager of the Leipzig–Dresden Railway Company and, later, the Saxon-Bavarian Railway Company. In 1843 he took up a post with the newly founded Royal Hanoverian State Railways. Here he was responsible for the mechanical engineering, operations, maintenance and the procurement of running and rolling stock. Thanks to him, an organised maintenance system and standardised railway operations emerged. He introduced feedwater preheating on locomotives using the Kirchweger condenser and introduced \\"Hanoverian standard locomotives\\" based on those built by Thomas Russell Crampton and Johann Friedrich Ludwig Wöhlert. In addition he produced plans for engines built by Georg Egestorff and pumps for Hanover's river water systems. After the Kingdom of Hanover was annexed by Prussia and the Hanoverian State Railways disbanded, Kirchweger was transferred against his will to Saarbrücken. As a result, he resigned from state service, worked for a short while in a coach factory and finally returned to Hanover as a civil engineer. Honours For his services to the railways he was given numerous honours. He became inter alia a freeman of the city of Hanover, a Knight of the Royal Guelphic Order, the Saxon Albert Order and the Swedish Order of Vasa.

History and profile Dom in svet was published from 1888 to 1943. Its long-running rivalry with the national-liberal journal Ljubljanski zvon was a major feature of Slovenian cultural life in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; historian Péter Krasztev describes the \\"clear- cut distinction between liberal and conservative\\" the pair of journals produced as \\"striking and uncharacteristic of the region\\". Dom in svet was founded in 1888 by the conservative Catholic editor Frančišek Lampe. It opposed both naturalist and avant-garde experimentations with Modernism, especially the Decadent movement, attacking Slovene and other Slavic writers whom they saw as their regional representatives, such as Anton Aškerc and Jaroslav Vrchlický. Instead the editorial line \\"steadily opposed the loosening of literary form and insisted on Christian-national and Pan-Slavic values\\". Nonetheless, it was diligent in reporting on Modernism and foreign literature: it published discussions of l'art pour l'art and the works of Schopenhauer and Tolstoy in its first few years in print, and in 1901 published a thorough review (by Lampe) of the past 20 years of European literature. Its editorial line remained conservative and opposed Modernism up to the early 20th century, under the influence of the integralist Catholic theologian Anton Mahnič. It assumed a more liberal direction in 1914, under the new editorship of Izidor Cankar, a prominent liberal Catholic essayist and art historian. Under Cankar, the journal reviewed art from more aesthetic perspective, and helped the Slovene Catholic establishment shed some of its anti-intellectual reputation. During the 1920s and 1930s, the journal adopted a moderate and liberal conservative stance, although it maintained a relatively open editorial policy towards other currents of Slovene Catholicism, especially the Christian left. In these two decades, the journal became one of the most progressive attitudes towards literature in Slovenia, becoming a platform for expressionist and modernist experiments. It also published numerous translations from foreign languages, especially of Catholic authors such as Paul Claudel, Georges Bernanos, Miguel de Unamuno, G. K. Chesterton and T. S. Eliot. A major split in the journal took place in 1937, when the Christian Socialist author and thinker Edvard Kocbek published an essay entitled \\"Reflections on Spain\\" (Premišljevanja o Španiji), where he sharply criticized the role of Catholic high clergy in the Spanish Civil War, especially its support of the pro- Fascist uprising of the general Francisco Franco. The essay provoked a huge controversy in the Catholic public opinion in Slovenia, which ended in the resignation of the editor of the journal, France Koblar. Kocbek and his circle left Dom in svet, establishing a new journal, called Dejanje (\\"Action\\"). The scandal seriously damaged the reputation of the journal. After the invasion of Yugoslavia and subsequent Italian occupation of Ljubljana in April 1941, Dom in svet was the only major Slovenian literary journal to continue publication. After the Nazi German occupation of the Province of Ljubljana in September 1943, it too ceased to be published. All issues of the journal are freely available online on the Digital Library of Slovenia.  Famous contributors  Besides the already mentioned, famous authors contributed to Dom in svet included historian Simon Rutar, intellectual Bogdan Radica, poets Joža Lovrenčič, Miran Jarc, Anton Vodnik, Jože Udovič, Božo Vodušek, and France Balantič, writers Fran Saleški Finžgar, Franc Ksaver Meško, France Bevk and Ivan Pregelj, playwright Stanko Majcen, literary critics France Vodnik and Jakob Šolar, literary historians Ivan Grafenauer and Tine Debeljak, theologian Aleš Ušeničnik, political theorist Andrej Gosar, politicians Janez Evangelist Krek and Evgen Lampe, musician and essayist Marij Kogoj, ethnologist Rajko Ložar, art historian Vojislav Mole, and many others.

Kerr played for Bohemians, the League of Ireland XI and Ireland. In 1924, he was a member of the first Ireland team selected by the FAI and at the same time he represented Ireland at the 1924 Olympics. He was also the first player to captain an FAI Ireland team in a home international. After retiring as a footballer, Kerr established himself a worldwide reputation as a leading bloodstock agent. Among the many racehorses he bought and sold were Nasrullah and Tomy Lee, who won the 1959 Kentucky Derby. Kerr also traded horses that won the Aintree Grand National, the Grand Prix de Paris, the French Derby, the Irish 2,000 Guineas, and the Irish St. Leger. His younger brother Kevin also played for Bohemians and was a successful horse trainer. His niece, Virginia Kerr, is one of Ireland's leading opera singers. Early years Kerr was born in County Dublin. He was the eldest son and second child of Joseph Kerr, who worked as a clerk with the Inland Revenue, and his wife, Mary, who originally came from County Laois.www.census.nationalarchives.ie Kerr was educated at the O'Connell School in Dublin and by 1911, then aged 17, he was living at 3 St. Alphonsus Road in Drumcondra. On leaving school, Kerr joined his father at the Inland Revenue and worked as a clerk. He later worked in an insurance brokerage. Football careerBohemians= Kerr first started playing for Bohemians in 1914, and he continued to play for the club until 1927. Throughout his career with the club, he regularly captained the team and for the 1918–19 season he was appointed club captain. While playing for Bohemians, he helped them win their first-ever League title in 1923–24. Bohs won the title after winning 15 successive league games. Other members of the team included Dave Roberts, Johnny McIlroy, Billy Otto, Christy Robinson, Jack McCarthy, and Johnny Murray. Kerr was also a member of the Bohs team that won the 1924 League of Ireland Shield. On 17 February 1924, while playing for Bohemians in the 1923–24 FAI Cup semi-final against Athlone Town at Shelbourne Park, he suffered a serious injury. In a clash with Town's Jim Sweeney, he broke his jaw and lost some teeth. Kerr remained involved with Bohemians, throughout the remainder of his life serving as both a committee member and as a club vice president. Kevin Kerr captained the club in 1942, twenty-three years after his older brother had the honour. After the Hoopers and the O'Kanes, they became the third set of brothers to captain Bohs. =League of Ireland XI= On 9 February 1924, Kerr was one of five Bohemians players to play for the first official League of Ireland XI when they made their debut in the 3–3 draw against the Welsh Football League XI at Dalymount Park. The other four were Dave Roberts, Johnny McIlroy, Christy Robinson, and Harry Willets. Among the other members of the team were Frank Collins, Ernie MacKay, and John Fagan.Freestaters - The Republic of Ireland Soccer Team 1921-1939 (2007): Donal Cullen =Ireland= In 1924, Kerr also made three international appearances for Ireland. He was a member of the first senior Ireland team selected by the FAI. The team competed at the 1924 Olympics and on 28 May, Kerr made his international debut against Bulgaria. Other members of the Ireland team included his Bohemians teammates, Jack McCarthy and Johnny Murray, as well Dinny Hannon, Ernie MacKay, Joe Kendrick, Tommy Muldoon, and Paddy Duncan. Kerr and his fellow footballers also became the first athletes to represent Ireland at the Summer Olympics under the auspices of the Irish Olympic Council. Ireland defeated Bulgaria 1–0 and thus progressed to the quarter-finals. On 2 June, Kerr made his second appearance against the Netherlands. Ireland lost this game 2–1 after extra time. On 14 June, Kerr made his third and final Ireland appearance in a friendly against the United States at Dalymount Park. He also served as Ireland captain for this game, thus making him the first player to captain an FAI Ireland team in a home international. Kerr led the team to a 3–1 win.1924 Olympic Games at RsssfUnited States results at Rsssf 1924 Olympic Report pg 324 www.sports- reference.com Bloodstock agent In September 1920, with support from his father, Kerr founded his own insurance and bloodstock agency. He had developed a knack for spotting the potential in young race horses and largely on the back of this reputation his agency, Kerr & Co. Ltd, developed into a successful family business. One of his biggest successes as a bloodstock agent came with the purchase of Nasrullah in 1944. This horse was acquired by Kerr & Co. Ltd from the renowned horse owner the Aga Khan III. The company owned him for three weeks before selling him on to Joseph McGrath. This deal was allegedly done over an afternoon cup of tea at Bewley's in Westmoreland Street. Kerr also purchased and sold on four horses that later won the Aintree Grand National. They included Sheila's Cottage in 1948, Freebooter in 1950, Anglo in 1966, and Red Alligator in 1969. Probably one of his greatest purchases was Tomy Lee, the winner of the 1959 Kentucky Derby. Tomy Lee became only the second non-American bred horse to ever win the Kentucky Derby, and Kerr became the first non-American agent to buy a winner. In 1956, Kerr attended the Newmarket sales, acting on the behalf of Fred Turner, a millionaire oilman and rancher from Texas. Turner had instructed Kerr to buy two horses that he had picked out of the catalogue. He was chiefly interested in a colt that came to be named Tuleg, but he also wanted a second horse in order to provide Tuleg with a travelling companion. This second horse was Tomy Lee. Shortly after Tomy Lee won the 1959 Kentucky Derby, Kerr relayed to Michael O'Hehir the story behind the purchase. O'Hehir then retold the story in the Daily Racing Form. After viewing Turner's first choice for Tuleg's travelling companion, Kerr was less than impressed and cabled him, advising him not to buy this particular foal. Instead, Kerr recommended another colt he had seen at the sale. Turner gave Kerr the go ahead \\"to bid up to $15,000,\\" and Kerr got Tomy Lee for $6,762. Tuleg was purchased for $25,000 and proved to be a dud, but Kerr's recommendation was a bargain. Kerr's reputation was not confined to Ireland or Kentucky. It extended to Hollywood, and among the many people he could count on as a friend, an acquaintance, and a client was Raoul Walsh. Together with his friend John Huston, Walsh was a keen horse racing fan. In 1951, on hearing that Huston, was travelling to England and suspecting that he might be interested in buying a horse, Walsh wrote to Huston and declared that \\"the finest and most honest man I can recommend is Bert Kerr.\\"Raoul Walsh - The True Adventures of Hollywood's Legendary Director: Marilyn Ann Moss Nearly eight years later, when Tomy Lee won the Kentucky Derby, Walsh provided Kerr with his own personal commentary. Always keen to follow the progress of his purchases, even after they had been moved on, Kerr had tuned into the American Forces Network for a commentary on the race. However, before it got underway, he received a phone call from Walsh, who was six thousand miles away in Hollywood watching the race on American television. As well as buying and selling horses for others, Kerr & Co. Ltd ran a successful racing stable which was managed by Bert's younger brother Kevin. The Bohemians influence on the Kerr's remained strong, and they adopted the club's red and black colours as their racing colours. In addition, among the many horses that passed through their stables was one in 1959 called Bohemian Boy. Kevin trained Sea Charger to victory in the 1953 Irish 2,000 Guineas and Irish St. Leger. More success came in 1965 when he won the Irish 2,000 Guineas for a second time with Green Banner. The buying and selling side of the business remained successful, and one of Kerr's most enthusiastic later clients was Stephen Sokolow, a Brazilian-born horse race owner who was prominent in French racing circles. Sokolow bought several yearlings from Kerr that excelled on the track. Among the more successful were Roll of Honour, who won the 1970 Grand Prix de Paris, and Hard to Beat, who won the 1972 French Derby. Both of these horses were ridden by Lester Piggott. Kerr & Co. Ltd still survives, and it claims to be the \\"oldest established still trading bloodstock agency in the world\\". Today the company is managed by Bert Kerr, Jr., a nephew of the original Bert Kerr.www.directoryoftheturf.com HonoursBohemians= *League of Ireland: 1 **1923–24 *League of Ireland Shield: 1 **1924 References Category:1896 births Category:1973 deaths Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:Bohemian F.C. players Category:League of Ireland players Category:Olympic footballers of Ireland Category:Footballers at the 1924 Summer Olympics Category:League of Ireland XI players Category:Horse racing in Ireland Category:Association footballers not categorized by position Category:People educated at O'Connell School ","title":"Bertie Kerr"},{"id":"21723027","text":"Peter Ivars is a Finnish orienteering competitor.

Synonyms include: \\"Linear nevus sebaceous syndrome (LNSS)\\", \\"Schimmelpenning-Feuerstein-Mims syndrome\\", \\"Feuerstein-Mims syndrome\\", \\"sebaceous nevus syndrome\\", \\"Solomon syndrome\\", and \\"Jadassohn's nevus phakomatosis\\". \\"Nevus\\" is sometimes spelled \\"naevus\\" and \\"sebaceous\\" may also be spelled \\"sebaceus\\". \\"Epidermal nevus syndrome\\" is sometimes used as a synonym, but more often as a broader term referring to Schimmelpenning syndrome in addition to nevus comedonicus syndrome, CHILD syndrome, Becker's nevus syndrome, and phakomatosis pigmentokeratotica. The classic Schimmelpenning syndrome diagnosis comprises a triad of sebaceous nevi, seizures, and mental retardation. The condition was first reported by Gustav Schimmelpenning in 1957 and independently reported by Feuerstein and Mims in 1962. Signs and symptoms Since the original identification of Schimmelpenning syndrome, the number of findings has expanded to the point that the syndrome is associated with a considerable constellation of abnormalities. The abnormalities may occur in a variety of combinations, and need not include all three aspects of the classic triad of sebaceous nevus, seizures and mental retardation. In 1998, a literature review by van de Warrenburg et al. found: * seizures in 67% of cases * mental retardation in 61% of cases * ophthalmological abnormalities in 59% of cases * involvement of other organ systems in 61% of cases * structural abnormality of cerebrum or cranium in 72% of cases The major neurological abnormalities include mental retardation to varying extent, seizures, and hemiparesis. Seizures, when present, typically begin during the first year of life. The most common structural central nervous system abnormalities in Schimmelpenning syndrome are hemimegalencephaly and ipselateral gyral malformations. The major ocular abnormalities are colobomas and choristomas. Skeletal abnormalities may include dental irregularities, scoliosis, vitamin D-resistant rickets and hypophosphatemia. Cardiovascular abnormalities include ventricular septal defect and coarctation of the aorta; urinary system issues include horseshoe kidney and duplicated urinary collection system. Genetic Schimmelpenning syndrome appears to be sporadic rather than inherited, in almost all cases. It is thought to result from genetic mosaicism, possibly an autosomal dominant mutation arising after conception and present only in a subpopulation of cells. The earlier in embryological development such a mutation occurs, the more extensive the nevi are likely to be and the greater the likelihood of other organ system involvement. DiagnosisManagement In general, children with a small isolated nevus and a normal physical exam do not need further testing; treatment may include potential surgical removal of the nevus. If syndrome issues are suspected, neurological, ocular, and skeletal exams are important. Laboratory investigations may include serum and urine calcium and phosphate, and possibly liver and renal function tests. The choice of imaging studies depends on the suspected abnormalities and might include skeletal survey, CT scan of the head, MRI, and/or EEG. Depending on the systems involved, an individual with Schimmelpenning syndrome may need to see an interdisciplinary team of specialists: dermatologist, neurologist, ophthalmologist, orthopedic surgeon, oral surgeon, plastic surgeon, psychologist. Incidence Nevus sebaceous was first identified in 1895 by Jadassohn. Sebaceous nevi occur in 1 to 3 of 1000 births, with equal incidence by sex. There is no test to determine whether an individual born with a sebaceous nevus will go on to develop further symptoms of Schimmelpenning syndrome. It has been reported that up to 10% of individuals with epidermal nevi may develop additional syndrome symptoms, but that number appears to be inconsistent with the rarity of the syndrome and may be overstated. Prevalence is unknown, but Epidermal nevus syndrome is listed with the National Organization for Rare Disorders, which defines rare as affecting \\"fewer than 200,000 people in the United States.\\" See also * Epidermis * Epidermal nevus syndrome * Skin lesion * List of cutaneous conditions References External links  Category:Epidermal nevi, neoplasms, and cysts Category:Syndromes affecting the nervous system ","title":"Schimmelpenning syndrome"},{"id":"21723064","text":"Environmental xenobiotics are xenobiotic compounds with a biological activity that are found as pollutants in the natural environment.  Pharmaceuticals  Pharmaceutical drugs are chemicals used for the alteration, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of disease, health conditions or structure/function of the human body. Some pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) can enter the environment by one route or another as the parent compound or as pharmacologically active metabolites. Drugs are developed with the intention of having a beneficial biological effect on the organism to which they are administered, but many such compounds all too often pass into the environment where they may exert an unwanted biological effect.Halling-Sorensen et al. 1998. Occurrence, fate, and effects of pharmaceutical substances in the environment-A Review. Chemosphere 36: 357-393 For many years PhACs have been all but ignored as environmental researchers concentrated on the well known environmentally dangerous chemicals that were/are largely used in agriculture and industry. But with increasing technology to help in the separation and identification of multiple compounds in a mixture, PhACs and their effects have received increasing attention.Daughton and Ternes. 1999. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the environment: Agents of subtle change? Environmental Health Perspectives 117:907-938. PhACs have not (until relatively recently) been seen as potentially toxic because regulations associated with pharmaceuticals are typically overseen by human health organizations which have limited experience with environmental issues.Jones et al. 2001. Human pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. Environmental Technology 22: 1383-1394 Nearly all categories of pharmaceuticals including pain killers (analgesics and anti-inflammatory), antibiotics (antibacterial), anticonvulsant drugs, Beta-blockers, blood lipid regulators, X-ray contrast media, cytostatic drugs (Chemotherapy), oral contraceptives, and veterinary pharmaceuticals among many others have been found in the environment.Heberer. 2002. Occurrence, fate and removal of pharmaceutical residues in the aquatic environment- A review of recent research data. Toxicology Letters 131: 5-17.  Sources and origins  PhACs can be entered into the environment in two main ways; direct and indirect. Indirect sources are PhACs that have performed their biologically intended effect and are passed onto the environment in either their complete or a modified state. PhAC's can be discharged directly by manufacturers of the pharmaceuticals or effluents from hospitals. However with increasing regulation by local, state and federal regulating agencies, direct discharge is becoming much less of an issue.Heberer. 2002. Occurrence, fate and removal of pharmaceutical residues in the aquatic environment- A review of recent research data. Toxicology Letters 131: 5-17. There are also several indirect sources of PhACs into the environment. One common indirect source of PhACs into the environment is the passing of antibiotics, anesthetics Daughton and Ternes. 1999. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the environment: Agents of subtle change? Environmental Health Perspectives 117:907-938. and growth promoting hormones Bound and Voulvoulis. 2004. Pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment- A comparison of risk assessment strategies. Chemosphere 56: 1143-1155. by domesticated animals in urine and manure. This is often stored in large pits before being pumped and applied to fields as fertilizers where many of the PhACs can be washed away by rainfall to aquatic environments. Family pets can also be an indirect source of PhACs into the environment.Daughton and Ternes. 1999. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the environment: Agents of subtle change? Environmental Health Perspectives 117:907-938. Most of the PhACs in the environment however come from human sources. A direct human source is leachate from a landfill. Often the pharmaceuticals that are located in landfills are found in their original, most chemically active state. Most pharmaceuticals are administered and passed through the human body in one of three ways: # Metabolized partially or completely within the body and made inactive (Ideal) # Partially metabolized and passed through the system # Passed through the body unmodified (Worst Case Scenario). In any manner PhACs are then passed to sewage treatment plants (STPs), where facilities are designed to break down natural human waste by microbial degradation. However, many PhACs are of very complex structure and are incompletely broken down in STPs before they are passed into the environment.Daughton and Ternes. 1999. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the environment: Agents of subtle change? Environmental Health Perspectives 117:907-938.  Fate in environment  Once PhACs are entered into the environment they suffer one of three fates: # Biodegradation into carbon dioxide and water. # Undergo some form of degradation and form metabolites. # Persist in the environment unmodified. The amount of the compound that is broken down depends on several factors such as bioavailability and compound structure among many others.  Effects  Because PhACs have come into the limelight relatively recently their effects on the environment are not completely understood. PhACs are also not generally intended to come in contact with the environment, and therefore are not typically tested environmentally prior to release. Therefore several tests are required to determine the different mechanisms and side effects of PhACs in the environment making testing largely impractical.Daughton and Ternes. 1999. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the environment: Agents of subtle change? Environmental Health Perspectives 117:907-938. Many PhACs have very broad modes of action in humans. Similar, subtle reactions may occur in organisms in the environment that are not easily seen by humans. Highly specific mechanisms in humans may solicit profound effects at extremely low concentrations. Many effects may not necessarily be readily detectable and lead to ecological change that would be erroneously attributed to natural change.Daughton and Ternes. 1999. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products in the environment: Agents of subtle change? Environmental Health Perspectives 117:907-938. This said there are several effects that have been identified in the literature. One long term, possibly irreversible effect is microbiological resistance to antibiotics (antibiotic resistance). Some bacteria may be able to survive when administered antibiotics (especially at low concentrations).Jorgenson and Halling-Sorensen. 2000. Drugs in the Environment. Chemosphere 40: 691-699. Those colonies will multiply and produce new colonies that are resistant to that particular antibiotic and will not succumb the next time antibiotics are administered. Because rivers and streams are ever flowing objects they are an ideal pathway for antibiotics to reach bacteria and therefore provide a source and reservoir for resistant strains to develop and establish themselves.Jones et al. 2001. Human pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. Environmental Technology 22: 1383-1394 Another recent discovery is endocrine disruptors. Endocrine disruptors can replace or disturb the balance of hormones within an organism and have been found to be occurring in waters with a concentration in the ng/L level for certain compounds. Some possible effects of endocrine disruptors are male and female sterility, feminization of males, masculinization of females and abnormal testes growth among many others. The exact pathway of occurrence of endocrine disruptors is not completely certain, however several pathways have been proposed.Jorgenson and Halling-Sorensen. 2000. Drugs in the Environment. Chemosphere 40: 691-699. Typically PhACs are found in low concentrations, (<1 ug/L) making acute toxicity effects fairly unlikely. However, because of their continual input to the environment it is possible for chronic toxicity effects to occur. One major area of concern with several compounds being present at low levels at the same time is what happens when the compounds mix? It is possible and truly likely that these mixtures will have additive, neutralistic or synergistic effects. But again testing would be both time consuming and very expensive to test all of the combined effects.

In 2009 it came under new leadership and was in the top 1% most improved schools in the country in 2010. Since then it has been in the top 1 or 2% of schools in the country for the value it adds to the expected progress of its students, (i.e. they achieve more at Whitefield than they might at most other schools). Whitefield was one of the first schools in Barnet to convert to academy status in 2011, in order to use the freedoms granted by this status to further improve the remarkable academic performance of its students. The sustained improvement in exam results, outstanding teachers and strong relationships between staff and students, has seen numbers applying to join Whitefield increase dramatically in recent years. Location The school is in Cricklewood, just south of the North Circular Road and west of the A41 Hendon Way. School Entrance co-ordinates: 51, 34.395N 0, 13.143W The nearest tube station is Brent Cross on the Northern line Edgware branch and the nearest bus station is Brent Cross Shopping Centre. History The school was built between 1953-54 on the site of the disused Hendon Metropolitan water treatment works, part of the original Clitterhouse Farm. It was originally a Secondary Modern School and opened in autumn 1954 later than originally intended. This gave pupils transferring from other schools in the then Borough of Hendon and surrounding areas an extra three weeks summer holiday. At the time of opening it had seven 1st year classes of between thirty and forty. Classes 1 and 2 first year had French or German in their curriculum, unusual at the time. Other older pupils transferred in to second, third and fourth year classes. In 1954 the school grounds extended only as far east as the Clitterhouse Brook, a small tributary of the river Brent. Many years later the grounds extended east beyond the Brook to the boundary with Hendon Way. This area was the overgrown disused site of the settling ponds of the old water treatment works which were transformed into school playing fields. Some time later, the playing field area west of Hendon Way was given up for development of Tesco Super store and Hendon Leisure Centre and the eastern school boundary became once again the Clitterhouse Brook. The first headmaster was Mr Haley who until then, had been headmaster at Bell Lane school, Hendon. Mr Brenig Lewis joined the school on opening as assistant head and science teacher. He eventually became Headmaster in 1971 and remained until his retirement in 1989. Other staff at the time of opening were Miss Hardman-Deputy Head; Mr Norman-Woodwork; Mr Ransome-Metalwork; Miss Stern-History; Mr Graves-Geography; Mr Dobbin-Science; Mr Reece-Music; Mr Hill-Maths; Mr Vincnt-Maths; Mr Brown-Geography; Mrs Siebold, an Austrian, taught German; Mr Ronald Edmanson NZ-PE (gymnastics); Mr Funk (American tempororary)- PE. There were many others whose specialities have become less well remembered: Mr Prior; Mrs Court; Mr Franklyn; Miss Swan. The original residential caretaker was a Mr Christ whose son Richard attended the school. Mr Christ had two assistant caretakers, Reg Daly and Bill Winny. .

Monoï oilMonoï Tiaré Tahiti History is an infused perfume-oil made from soaking the petals of Tahitian gardenias (best known as Tiaré flowers) in coconut oil. Monoï (pronounced Mah-noy) is a Tahitian word meaning \\"scented oil\\" in the Reo-Maohi language. Monoï is widely used among French Polynesians as a skin and hair softener. It is also popular in Europe and gaining recognition in the United States. Authentic Tahitian monoi oil follows a strict manufacturing code that oversees the entire process from handpicking the tiare flowers to storage and shipping of the final product. This process has been validated and protected by an Appellation of Origin which was awarded to Monoi de Tahiti on April 1, 1992.  History  The date when monoi was first created is unknown; however, its origins can be traced back 2000 years to the Maohi people, the indigenous Polynesians. Early European explorers who travelled to the Polynesian Islands, including James Cook, documented the natives’ use of monoi for medicinal, cosmetic and religious purposes. Monoi featured prominently in the lives of these ancient people, from birth until death. It was applied to the bodies of newborns to keep them from dehydrating in hot weather, and from getting chilled in cooler temperatures. When a person died, their body was embalmed and perfumed with manoi to help facilitate their journey into the afterlife. Monoi was also used in ancient Polynesian religious rites. During ceremonies which took place in the maraes (temples), Maori priests used manoi to anoint sacred objects and purify offerings to their deities. Maori navigators used manoi to protect their bodies from cold, harsh winds and salt water during long canoe expeditions at sea. (Even today, many divers rub monoi all over their bodies prior to diving for the same purpose.) In 1942, monoi began to be manufactured commercially.  Ingredients  Tiaré flower. = Tiare flower = The tiare flower (Gardenia tahitensis), from the family Rubiaceae, is Tahiti's national flower. The small white, star-shaped flower grows on high bushes throughout French Polynesia, which features soil of coral origin, and blossoms all year long. Other names for this flower include Tiare Tahiti and Tiare Maohi. Beyond their contribution to Monoi Tiare Tahiti, tiare flowers are deeply rooted in everyday Polynesian life. In traditional medicine, the flower is prepared in a variety of concoctions to alleviate a range of common maladies including the common cold, headaches and sunburn. Many Polynesians enjoy placing a few tiare flowers on a small, water-filled saucer to release the fragrance throughout their \\"fares\\" (Polynesian houses). The flower necklaces that are offered to tourists as a welcome gesture are created with tiare flowers, and vahine (Polynesian women) customarily wear them behind one ear. The tiare flowers that are used in Monoi de Tahiti are hand-picked at a very particular stage of their growth, specifically when they are still unopened. The flowers are immediately taken to the manufacturing plant and stripped of their pistils. The flower portion is placed in refined coconut oil for a minimum of 15 days. This is known as \\"enfleurage\\" (flower soaking), a French term used to designate a specific extraction step. According to specific maceration standards set by the decree of Appellation d'Origine, which each manufacturer must scrupulously follow, a minimum of 15 tiare flowers must be used in every liter of refined coconut oil. = Coconut Oil = Coconut palm trees remain the most utilized Polynesian island tree and cover approximately of land. Under favorable conditions, the coconut palm tree grows its first fruits during its 6th year and produces approximately 60 coconuts per year, from its 10th to its 70th year. As the nut begins to form it is completely empty and contains no nutrients. When its size increases, the shell hardens and becomes filled with a transparent liquid that will turn into oil upon full maturity. When the coconuts fall from the trees, they are gathered to undergo the ancient process of extracting the coconut almonds. The shell is cracked open with an ax. The two coconut halves are left for several hours in the sun, until the almonds have shrunk enough to be removed and broken into small pieces. The fragments are then taken to special flat wooden barracks covered with sliding metal roofs which are popularly known on the Polynesian islands as \\"coprah dryers\\". The sliding roofs are only used at night and during the rainy season. The coprah is left to dry for more than a week until the coconut meat has lost over 90% of its moisture. Placed into special natural fiber bags, the coconut fragments are shipped to the unique oil mill located on the island of Tahiti where they will be thrown into special machines and ground to a fine coco flour. The flour is then heated up to 125 degrees and finally pressed into raw coconut oil. After that step, the oil will undergo more refining to remove all impurities and obtain the highest possible quality. Once the refining process is completed the coconut oil is placed into special storage tanks until it is purchased by one of only a handful of Monoi manufacturers. These manufacturers will proceed individually to the final maceration step which is to infuse the oil with Tiare flowers. Monoi de Tahiti must be stored in drums with a food-suitable liner or material. Drums must be lead-sealed when they leave Tahiti and kept away from humidity, light and heat.  Common uses  Recent manufacturer tests verify that monoi oil is rich in methyl salicylate which is a skin-soothing agent. It is a naturally concentrated emollient which penetrates the skin, re-hydrates the layers of the epidermis and shields skin against external damages including sun and wind. Monoi oil is used: * After a shower or bath to rehydrate skin. * Before or after a swim, it provides protection against the effects of sun, wind, sea or pool water * As a pre-shampoo hot oil treatment, it helps repair and deep condition the hair to a healthy shine. * As a hair treatment after shampooing, once hair is dry. It adds shine, smooths frizz, and conditions the hair. * During a bath. A few drops in the water reportedly encourages relaxation while keeping skin soft and subtly fragrant. * As a dark tanning oil * After being warmed in the palms of the hands, it is suited for massaging sore parts of the body or for warming up a weak body. * As a pain reliever for sunburn.

It is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Río Dulce National Park.Quan and Morales 2004, pp.17–18. A significant increase in the number of visiting tourists was recorded in the period 2001–2003, over 90% of whom were Guatemalans.Quan and Morales 2004, p.18. The figures for these period show a jump from 45,652 tourists in 2001 to just over 156,000 visitors in 2003.Quan and Morales 2004, p.19. The fort was badly damaged by an earthquake on 11 July 1999, suffering a number of cracks in its walls.Putzeys and Ortega 2001, p.621. The river water around the fort has been found to be heavily contaminated with coliform bacteria resulting from local pollution. History San Felipe had continuous occupation from the Mesoamerican Middle Preclassic period (c.1000–400 BC) and was still inhabited when the Spanish first arrived in the region in the mid 16th century.Putzeys and Ortega 2001, p.624.

Feldman 1998, p.11. mostly by English pirates. After nightfall, passage along the river into the lake was blocked by a large chain that crossed from the fort to the far bank. San Antonio was the main port for receiving Spanish shipping carrying goods for the Captaincy General of Guatemala and was responsible for supplying and garrisoning the fort.Feldman 2000, p.217. Putzeys and Ortega 2001, p.621. Guatemalan records contain details of captains being appointed to the fort well into the 18th century. The position was a joint post, also including the position of mayor of San Pedro de Amatique and San Antonio de las Bodegas. The latter post was in name only, since the towns were soon abandoned due to constant slave raids by the Mosquito Zambo that left the Motagua delta and shores of Lake Izabal largely deserted, with those inhabitants that did not flee being sold into slavery in the British colony of Jamaica. A census taken in October 1776 recorded 122 inhabitants of San Felipe, all of whom were either Spanish or mixed race.Feldman 1998, pp.11–12. In 1797 the garrison numbered 36 infantry. =Construction= A tower already existed on the site by 1604, when it is recorded as having been destroyed.Quan and Morales 2004, p.17. The fort was built in 1644 under the orders of Diego de Avendaño, then governor of the Kingdom of Guatemala. At the time it was known as Fuerte Bustamente (\\"Bustamente Fort\\") and the Torreón de Defensa (\\"Defence Tower\\"). The design of the walls was modified by the oidor (high judge) Lara y Mogrovejo, from whom it gained the \\"de Lara\\" part of its name. It was rebuilt in 1651 under orders of Lara y Mogrovejo. The fort was redesigned in 1687 by Diego Gómez de Ocampo in the style of the French military architect Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban. The modified design was implemented in 1689. Three bastions were functioning by 1697 (Nuestra Señora de Concepción, Nuestra Señora de Regla and the San Felipe Keep). Additional fortifications were designed by engineer José Sierra and added in 1797; they included three artillery batteries known as the batteries of San Carlos, San Felipe and Santiago. Two barracks were also added (Buenavista and Santiago). Layout The fort consists of a semicircular bastion enclosed behind two converging outer walls, each terminating in a roughly square tower. The fort has three storeys. The land approach to the fort was protected by a moat with drawbridge.Putzeys and Ortega 2001, pp.622, 626.

Born in Saskatoon in 1923. An early film of his, Helicopter Canada was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. He started with the NFB in the early 1950s while it was still based in Ottawa. He moved with his wife Delia to Montreal when the head office was transferred. In 1986, he was diagnosed with Haemochromatosis shortly after reading a magazine article about the work of Marie Warder, founder of the Canadian Haemochromatosis Society. His cinematography credits include serving as director of photography of Donald Brittain's 1964 film Fields of Sacrifice. Fields was one of the films he was most proud of as it provided a sense of dignity of the fallen, without glorifying war. During the early 1970s he worked with a number of aboriginal film makers as part of the NFB efforts to help people tell their own stories, including the 1970 documentary film This Was the Time. He worked on films across Canada and around the world, including India, Afghanistan, Ghana and throughout Europe. His films won many awards including Genies. He attended the Oscars when his film \\"Helicopter Canada\\" was nominated. The film was Canada's office centennial film. For two years he travelled across the country filming. The helicopter used was an Allouette II, chosen for its ability at high altitudes in order to be able to film in the western mountains. In the early 1970s he moved out to Vancouver, BC to be the technical producer for the NFB office. He eventually went back to his first love of being a hands-on film maker. He worked with many young film makers in British Columbia. During his time in Vancouver he worked on a number of films including directing Canaries to Clydesdales about two vets interior of the province as well as Pacific Highliner, about the fishing industry. Over his career he worked on close to 200 films in various capacities. Prior to getting into film he worked as a taxi driver, specialty welder and in aircraft factories mainly in BC and Ontario. He initially got into still photography by accident. A fare left a camera in the car one day and a little later in the day he came across a streetcar accident. He use the camera to take some photos and took them to the local paper. He was offered some work based on what they saw. He did stills work in Saskatoon for a while. One of his favourite things was to take photos of visiting bands. He was interested in music and played in a number of bands. Skilled like his father in woodwork and metal craft, he often developed special tools for film making, including a camera crane system. For a film about logging, he made a rig and pole system that allowed him to drop a film camera in a manner that simulated the falling of a tree. He died in Richmond, BC on March 14, 2003.

His highest rank was sekiwake. He wrestled for Takasago stable. He made his debut in 1963 and had one of the longest professional careers of any wrestler, fighting 1613 bouts in total, of which 1543 were consecutive. This latter record is second only to Aobajō. After his retirement in 1985 he was an elder of the Japan Sumo Association and the head coach of Nakamura stable. Career He was the eldest son of a farmer, and was enrolled in the judo club at junior high school. He made his professional debut in March 1963. He was given the shikona of Fujizakura, meaning \\"cherry of Fuji\\", a reference to the prefectural flower of Yamanashi, a small pale red and white flower that blooms only around Mount Fuji. He reached sekitori status in January 1970 and was promoted to the top makuuchi division in September 1971. He was a runner-up in only his second honbasho or tournament in the division and was awarded the Fighting Spirit Prize. He fought in makuuchi for 73 tournaments in total, winning eight special prizes, and nine gold stars for defeating yokozuna. His highest rank was sekiwake, which he reached in March 1974. He was demoted to the jūryō division on two occasions in 1979 and 1980, but each time made an immediate comeback to makuuchi. His final top division tournament was in January 1984, where he had to withdraw through injury – coincidentally, his long-time stablemate Takamiyama withdrew from the same tournament and this was also his final makuuchi appearance. This brought to an end Fujizakura's run of 1543 consecutive appearances from his professional debut, which was the most in sumo history at the time. As of 2017 it is second only to Aobajō's 1630 consecutive bouts. He was a favourite of Emperor Hirohito, a noted fan of sumo. His May 1975 bout with Kirinji in which he thrust at his opponent over 50 times but lost, was named one of the \\"Best 10 All Time Battles in Ozumo\\" by the Nikkei newspaper. Retirement from sumo Fujizakura retired in March 1985, after facing demotion to the makushita division. He became an elder of the Japan Sumo Association, opening up Nakamura stable in 1986, taking four jonokuchi ranked wrestlers from Takasago stable. He had a policy of not accepting foreign-born wrestlers or makushita tsukedashi entrants with a college sumo background, and encouraged his wrestlers to obtain high school diplomas by correspondence courses over the internet. He produced a handful of jūryō ranked wrestlers but none reached the top division. He also served as a judge of tournament bouts for over 20 years, and held the post of Deputy Director of Judging. Nakamura stable closed at the end of 2012, and he retired from the Sumo Association upon turning 65 in February 2013. Fighting style Fujizakura was a pusher-thruster who preferred oshi-sumo techniques to fighting on the mawashi or belt (yotsu-sumo). His speciality was tsuppari, a series of rapid thrusts to the opponent's chest. He was small by sumo standards, but was such an enthusiastic trainer in his younger days that he even had to be warned by his stablemaster at the time, former yokozuna Maedayama, not to over-train.

He founded the towage and salvage company L. Smit & Co that is now part of Smit International. His shipyard had a number of \\"firsts\\" in shipbuilding and produced a number of famous vessels. Family life Smit was born in Alblasserdam, the son of Jan Foppe Smit and Marrijgje Ceele. He married Jannigje Pieterse Mak on 29 June 1806 in Alblasserdam. Business history After the death of his father Jan (on whose yard he had worked before then as a shipwright) Fop Smit took over the management of the yard, together with his brother Jan in 1820. They built an early wooden river steamboat, Willem I, in 1825. This design (by the Frisian marine architect Van Loon) was so successful that they soon had orders for another five steamships. After the association between the brothers ended in 1828, Fop Smit received an order for the first Dutch seagoing steamship, Batavier from the Nederlandsche Stoomboot Maatschappij in Rotterdam. This ship was launched in 1830. It plied the Rotterdam-London route. (2003) Nederlandse Clippers, Uitgeverij Van Wijnen, , pp. 136-137 Smit built his first ocean- going ship, intended for the trade on the East Indies at his yard in Kinderdijk in 1838. On 6 November 1842 Smit contracted with 47 Rotterdam shipowners and maritime insurers to build a steam tug and station it in Hellevoetsluis for towage work. The tug Kinderdijk was launched on 31 August 1843 and put in service by December of that year. By the time of his death in 1866 the company owned nine paddle steamer tugboats. In 1847 his yard built the first iron ship in the Netherlands, the brigantine Industrie, for the account of the Rotterdam shipowner Willem Ruys. This was followed in 1853 by the first Dutch iron clipper ship California, built for the account of the Amsterdam firm Louis Bienfait & Zn. This ship on its maiden voyage reached its destination Port Adelaide in Australia with British emigrants on board in 86 days under captain Jaski. Other famous clippers, built by the yard, were Noach I through VI. Noach I sailed in 65 days from Anyer on the Sunda Strait to The Lizard in 1867. Smit also branched out to naval construction. His Kinderdijk yard in 1856 built two schooner-rigged screw-steam corvettes: Zr. Ms. Bali for the Dutch navy, and Japan for the Japanese shōgun.*H. Huygens, \\"Z.M. schroef- schooner Bali,\\" in: Verhandelingen en berigten betrekkelijk het zeewezen en de zeevaartkunde, vol. 17 (1857), pp. 178–183 The latter ship sailed with a Dutch naval detachment to Nagasaki in Japan under Lt. Willem Huyssen van Kattendijke in 1857. Japan was later renamed Kanrin Maru, the first screw-driven Japanese steam warship. Several ships built in Fop Smit's shipyards became involved in the naval engagements of the Boshin War. The last ship Fop Smit laid down was the clipper Nestor, but he died in Nieuw-Lekkerland at age 89 before he could complete this. After his death, his son Leendert took over the management of the yard. The Smit shipyard was one of the Dutch shipyards that eventually became part of the IHC Gusto Engineering and SBM Offshore marine and offshore engineering firms.

The building was designed by the joint venture of Brooks, Barr, Graeber and White of Austin, Texas, and Pitts, Mebane, Phelps and White of Houston, Texas. The principal construction contractor was the J.W. Bateson Company of Dallas, Texas. Construction on the New Labor Building (NDOL) began in the middle 1960s. When finished in 1975 the new building contained over one million square feet of usable space and cost $95 million. It was one of the first federal buildings to obtain air rights so that it could be constructed over a freeway, I-395. The ceremonial cornerstone for the NDOL was laid on October 18, 1974, with President Gerald R. Ford and Secretary Peter J. Brennan presiding. In February 1975 the first wave of employees moved in. After a number of years, the name \\"New Labor Building\\" no longer seemed appropriate. Finally, an employee suggested that the building should be renamed for the former Secretary of Labor, Frances Perkins, and the idea was warmly accepted. Senator Carl Levin of Michigan also played a significant role in the notion. The ceremony to rename the NDOL and dedicate it as the Frances Perkins Building was held on April 10, 1980 – the 100th anniversary of her birth. President Jimmy Carter and Secretary of Labor Ray Marshall presided over the ceremony; Senator Levin was present as well, as was Susanna Coggeshall, the daughter of Perkins. A plaque on the building said that Perkins' \\"legacy of social action enhances the lives of all of us.\\" On the same day, the United States Postal Service issued a new 15-cent stamp bearing the likeness of Perkins. = Events = Meeting of the G-20 Ministers, held at the building in 2010 In April 2010, there was a meeting of the Labor and Employment Ministers of the G-20 hosted by Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis. Facilities Interior of the building in 2009, as new Secretary Hilda Solis arrives The building is located at the northeast corner of Constitution Avenue and 3rd Street NW. The Visitor's Entrance, referred to as the Fountain Entrance, is one block north of Constitution Avenue on 3rd Street NW at 3rd and C Streets NW. The area is congested and the Judiciary Square station of the Washington Metro is often the best way to reach the department. The six- story structure is made of steel and limestone. The building features the Cesar Chavez Auditorium, Wirtz Library, and the Labor Hall of Honor.

Despite demonstrating excellent performance and manoeuvrability, only three prototypes were built, post World War I cost cutting leading to the DH.10 not being replaced. Development and design In 1918, the British Air Ministry drew up specification A.2 (B) for the replacement of the Airco DH.10 medium bomber, despite the fact that the DH.10 Amiens had not yet entered service. In response, J.D North, chief designer of Boulton & Paul's aircraft department designed a twin-engined aircraft, the P.7 Bourges, powered, like most of the types designed to replace the DH.10, by two of the new ABC Dragonfly radial engines. The ABC was ordered off the drawing board by the Ministry and high hopes were held for it. The Bourges was a three-seat, three bay biplane with unstaggered wings of all-wooden construction. The armament was two Lewis guns - one in the nose on a Scarrf mounting and the other in the dorsal position - and of bombs in three bomb cells with doors. Three prototypes were ordered by the Air Ministry. Delays in delivery of airworthy examples of the Dragonfly lead to the decision to fit the first prototype with the much less powerful ), but reliable Bentley BR2 rotary engine as a temporary measure, allowing a first flight as the Bourges Mk IIA in June 1919. Frank Courtney demonstrated the Bourges at Hendon at the end of May 1919 for a reception for Commander Read who had led the crossing of the Atlantic by US seaplanes. The magazine Flight commenting on its aerobatic capabilities and general performance though having already flown about 3,500 miles. It was fitted with Dragonflys in July, becoming the Bourges Mk IA,. Both the BentleyBrew 2001 and ABC engined Bourges demonstrated excellent performance and manoeuvrability, being able to be looped and rolled with ease. Courtney wrote that it could \\"be thrown around in loops, spins, rolls...without any special effort\\". This acrobatic quality was displayed for the reception at Hendon of Commander Read after his cross- Atlantic crossing by flying boat. The second aircraft was fitted with a gulled upper wing to improve the field of fire for its gunners - the engines moved down to the top of the lower wing. To give greater clearance for the propellors, the undercarriage was lengthened. Fitted with Dragonflys, it was designated the Bourges Mk IB. It would crash in 1919 and its structure reused for a different project. The third Bourges was also originally built as a Mk IB, but when Boulton Paul realised that the reliability problems with the Dragonfly could not be cured, it was refitted with BR2s, being redesignated Bourges Mk IIB. In 1920-21 the third prototype, the Bourges P.7B F2905 was again re-engined, this time with 450 hp (336 kW) Napier Lion engines fitted onto the lower wing, and was flown both with the original straight upper wing (Bourges Mk IIIA) and with the gulled wing (Bourges Mk IIIB). While, in this form, it was superior to the other types planned as DH.10 replacements, the RAF had by this time abandoned the requirement, and the Bourges was used for extensive testing at the Royal Aircraft Establishment, Farnborough continuing in use until 1924. On one occasion it was used at a public display at Croydon in a mock dogfight with two Nieuport Nighthawk fighters. The second prototype was rebuilt to produce the Boulton Paul Atlantic.

Details An ideal op-amp amplifies the differential input; if this input difference is 0 volts (i.e. both inputs are at the same voltage), the output should be zero. However, due to manufacturing process, the differential input transistors of real op-amps may not be exactly matched. This causes the output to be zero at a non-zero value of differential input, called the input offset voltage. Typical values for V_{os} are around 1 to 10 mV for cheap commercial-grade op-amp integrated circuits (IC). This can be reduced to several microvolts if nulled using the IC's offset null pins or using higher-quality or laser-trimmed devices. However, the input offset voltage value may drift with temperature or age. Chopper amplifiers actively measure and compensate for the input offset voltage, and may be used when very low offset voltages are required. Input bias current and input offset current also affect the net offset voltage seen for a given amplifier. The voltage offset due to these currents is separate from the input offset voltage parameter and is related to the impedance of the signal source and of the feedback and input impedance networks, such as the two resistors used in the basic inverting and non-inverting amplifier configurations. FET-input op-amps tend to have lower input bias currents than bipolar-input op-amps, and hence incur less offset of this type. Input offset voltage is symbolically represented by a voltage source that is in series with either the positive or negative input terminal (it is mathematically equivalent either way). Normally input offset voltage is measured in the terms of input voltage applied at the non-inverting terminal to make output zero. http://www.ti.com/lit/an/sloa059/sloa059.pdf page 3 ReferencesExternal links *Analog Devices tutorial on op-amp input offset voltage and mitigation techniques Category:Electrical parameters ","title":"Input offset voltage"},{"id":"21723711","text":"Mahoran may refer to: * Something of, from, or related to Mayotte * A person from Mayotte, or of Mahoran descent, as described in Demographics of Mayotte and Culture of Mayotte * One of the languages of Mayotte * Mahoran cuisine  See also  * List of all pages beginning with \\"Mahoran\\" Category:Language and nationality disambiguation pages ","title":"Mahoran"},{"id":"21723753","text":"An industrial suburb is a community, near a large city, with an industrial economy.

Letter from Jimmy Michels, April 28, 1945 to Whiting, Indiana (near Chicago/Riverside, Illinois) workers (blood donors). On February 23, Michels was part of the 40-man combat patrol that was sent at 8 AM to climb up the east slope of Mount Suribach to seize and occupy the crest. First Lieutenant Harold Schrier, who led the patrol, was to raise an American flag he was given to signal that the mountaintop was captured. Once Schrier and his men were on top, a Japanese iron water pipe was found to attach the flag unto. Lieutenant Schrier, Corporal Charles Lindberg, and Sergeant Henry Hansen, tied the flag unto the pipe while Private Phil Ward held the bottom end of the pipe horizontally off the ground. Platoon Sergeant Ernest Thomas was in among the three Marines watching, armed with his rifle and a grenade in hand, while Michels with his carbine was watching for an enemy attack on the group while this was all going on. The flagstaff was then carried to the highest point on the crater and raised and planted in the ground by Schrier, Thomas, and Hansen at approximately 10:30 AM. Rural Florida Living.

Chicago Veteran Recognized In Role For Iwo Jima Flag Raising Shortly thereafter, fighting took place between the Marines and Japanese because of the flag raising, the Japanese were hiding in caves on the mountain when they saw the flag go up. Some two hours later, in order for the American flag to be seen more easily from the ships, beaches, and land on the north side of Mount Suribachi, it was decided that a larger flag should be sent up Mount Suribachi to replace the first flag. The replacement flag attached to another and heavier pipe was raised on the mountain top simultaneous with the lowering of the first flagstaff. It was the black-and-white photograph shot of the second flag-raising by Associated Press photographer Joe Rosenthal which became renowned, made the second-flag raisers famous, and led to the creation of the huge Marine Corps War Memorial (sometimes called the Iwo Jima Memorial) in 1954, at Arlington, Virginia. = Post-war and death = After the war, Michels returned to and lived in Riverside, Illinois.

He began his career writing for the Jewish press in support of the Russian Revolution in 1910. During the First World War, he moved to the United States in 1915, settling in New York City, where he continued his career in journalism. Much of his work was in support of communism, and he was a founding member of the Workers Party. In 1922, he founded The Morning Freiheit, and served as its editor until his death in 1939. Early life Moissaye Joseph Olgin was born on March 24, 1878 in Buki, Ukraine (then part of the Russian Empire) to Chaim Aaron Novominsky and Tsipe (Gelman) Novominsky, both of whom were of ethnic Jewish origins.Lawrence Kestenbaum (ed.), \\"Moissaye Olgin,\\" The Political Graveyard.com Retrieved November 2, 2009. His father worked as a lumber camp employee.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole, The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pp. 178–179. Olgin received a traditional education in Hebrew. After a short period of self-study, he began his studies at the University of Kiev in 1900. He was sympathetic to the causes of the Russian Revolution, and first became active in the underground revolutionary movement during his studies at the University of Kiev. His writings for Jewish and revolutionary publications earned him some fame among the many Russian Jews, who were heavily oppressed by the government of Tsar Nicholas II. He took part in a Jewish revolutionary student group known as \\"Freiheit\\" (Freedom). In 1901 Olgin was elected chairman of the Students Central Committee. The tsarist regime ordered his arrest in April 1903 on a charge of organizing Jewish self- defense groups against anticipated pogroms.The Staff of the Morning Freiheit. M.J. Olgin (1878–1939) from M.J. Olgin: Leader and Teacher. New York: Workers Library Publishers, December 1939. Retrieved February 26, 2009. In 1904, Olgin left the University of Kiev and went to Vilno as a member of the Vilno Committee of the Jewish Bund. There he was arrested but released on bail. He then became a member of the editorial board of the Arbeiter Stimme (Labor's Voice). He was the author of all the proclamations issued by the Central Committee of the Bund during the Revolution of 1905 while at the same time he prepared literary compositions for the illegal Jewish press. While editing newspapers and working with these underground organizations he also wrote books, short stories and literary essays. In 1907, he traveled to Germany to continue his studies at the University of Heidelberg. He continued his studies there until 1910, when he returned to Russia. Traveling in Germany at the onset of World War I, he was unable to return to Russia, and immigrated to the United States in 1915. Career Shortly after arriving in the United States, Olgin became a regular contributor to the Jewish daily newspaper The Forward. Olgin became an American citizen in April 1920. He was a leading member of the Jewish Socialist Federation of the Socialist Party of America and was influential in leading the JSF out of the party at a special convention of the organization held in September 1921. Together with other defecting members of the JSF, Olgin thereafter entered the fledgling Workers Council organization, a small group of revolutionary socialists which rejected the conspiratorial \\"underground\\" form of organization of the then extant communist movement. Olgin ceased contributing to The Forward at this same time. In April 1922, there was launched a new Yiddish-language newspaper, the Daily Freiheit (later the Morning Freiheit). Olgin served as first editor of this publication, a position which he retained up until the time of his death.William Z. Foster and Earl Browder, \\"Moissaye Joseph Olgin: March 24, 1878 – November 22, 1939: Statement of the National Committee, Communist Party of the USA,\\" The Communist, vol. 18, no. 12 (December 1939), p. 1138. He also contributed frequently to the Communist Party's English-language newspaper, The Daily Worker, and served as a special correspondent for the Soviet Communist Party's daily, Pravda. At the end of December 1922, the Workers Council group was among the organizations which were united into the Workers Party of America (WPA), a new \\"legal political party\\" affiliated with the underground Communist Party of America, and Olgin thereby entered the formal communist movement for the first time. Olgin was named to the governing Bureau of the Jewish Federation of this new organization. Olgin was a member of the governing Central Executive Committee of the WPA and its Executive Council from the time of the organization's formation. Olgin was a frequent candidate for political office on behalf of the Communist Party. He first ran in 1924, when he was a candidate for New York State Assembly on the ticket of the Workers Party. He ran for U.S. Congress in 1926, 1930, and 1934, and for New York Assembly again in 1927, 1929, 1933, and 1936. Although a bitter rival of Alexander Bittelman in the heated factional politics of the Jewish Federation in the early 1920s, by the middle of the decade, Olgin had emerged as a supporter of the political faction that was headed by William Z. Foster, Earl Browder, and his former foe. Olgin made several trips to the Soviet Union. In 1937, he went to Paris as delegation to the International Yiddish Culture Congress which founded the World Alliance for Jewish Culture (YCUF). While in Paris, he addressed the Writers Congress. Death and legacy Following his trip to Paris, Olgin's health began to decline. After almost two years' illness, during which Olgin continued his work for the Freiheit, as well as for the Daily Worker and as the American correspondent for Pravda, he had apparently improved in health enough to appear at Madison Square Garden, on November 13, for his first public speech in several years. Following the speech, his health again declined, and he died at his home of a heart attack on November 22, 1939. He was buried in New Montefiore Cemetery near Farmingdale, New York. Olgin was the author of numerous books and pamphlets in seven languages: English, Russian, German, French, Polish, Hebrew and Yiddish. It is not known whether some of these works were, in fact, translated by others. He wrote verse, essays, literary criticism and sociological studies. His books The Soul of the Russian Revolution and A Guide to Russian Literature and pamphlet Why Communism? achieved sales of nearly half a million in several languages. Olgin translated several volumes of Lenin's collected works from Russian into English; Friedrich Engels' The Peasant War in Germany from German into Yiddish; John Reed's Ten Days That Shook the World from English into Yiddish; a volume of short stories from Polish into Yiddish; two volumes of tales of Mendele Mocher Sforim, the father of Jewish literature, from Hebrew into Yiddish; and Jack London's Call of the Wild from English into Yiddish. Olgin was known as one of the most enthusiastic proponents of the Stalinist current in American Communism. For example, he was the Party's expert on fighting Trotskyism (see reference to his book on that subject; below). Selected works *The Soul of the Russian Revolution.

It is one of the large, ancient city centers of the Tashkent oasis. Kanka is the first capital of the Chach state, a small estate of Kanguy.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5286/ Site Description Monumental fortification walls with towers surround the huge territory of more than 160 hectares. There are three cities inside, located within one another, and each of them has its own fortification, curtains, and ditches. Inside is a small town typical of contemporary city planning, which has a suspension bridge. In its northeast part rises the most powerful construction of the city-citadel-arch, with a height more than 40 meters, with the governor's palace, man-sided bastions, and house temple. The total area is 220 hectares. Kanka divides into three parts: citadel, shakhristan (town territory), and rabad (trade and commercial outskirt). Citadel is almost square-shaped, and has a height of 35 m. There is a huge castle with four towers at the base of citadel. The castle has been separated from the building by a huge ditch. It stands on the powerful platform, the top part of which has nine lines of pahsa (adobe clay). Inside of the platform, more ancient buildings are concealed. There are buildings of 6th-7th and 11th-12th centuries in the top layer of the citadel. In the center of the northern facade was the only entrance to citadel. A distinctive peculiarity of Kanka is that it has three Shakhristans, the establishment of which reflects the stages of the dynamics of town development. Shakhristan I includes citadel (in the northwestern edge and it has correct square form of quadrangle stretched to the west from the river. The height of fortification walls from its base is 26 m. Shakhristan I was encompassed by a wide ditch (about 35 m.). The only gate is in the center of the southern side. Evidently, there was a tower, from where a drawbridge was thrown. The depth of the cultural layers is not the uniform, and in the western part, it is 26 m. In the territory of Shakhristan I urban development was found from the 11th - 12th centuries, and ruins of town temples from the 6th - 7th centuries. Shakhristan II surrounds Shakhristan I from three sides and it has square form too, but it stretches along riverbed. Its total area equals to 45 hectares. It has very compact planning and encompassed with its own fortification wall. Separation of this territory is the result of temporary shortening of urban territory in the beginning of 7th century. Shakhristan III includes all these parts; its planning nears to trapezium [approximates a trapezoid?]. The total area of the urban territory, surrounded by the stronghold walls, is 160 hectares. It was discovered that there was a terrace and a little ditch in front of the stronghold walls. Southwestern and Central tracts of Shakhristan III have been planned very densely with a street net and bazaar squares. The western and northeastern parts do not have any buildings. There are unique production shops and city caravanserai, which were discovered as well in this part of the settlement. The rabad encompasses urban territory in a horseshoe shape, from the east and southwest. It is unknown whether stronghold walls have been installed because a large territory of the rabad is ploughed up. The city appeared in the 4th century B.C., and it was identified by the Greek sources with Antihiey Zayaksartskoy. In subsequent centuries it was part of the Kanguy State and was known as a first capital of Chach (\\"Yuni-Shi\\",in Chinese sources). The north route of the Great Silk Road ran through it. It was described as Kharashet in Arabic sources (etymological meaning is «the city of holly farna»), a second under the economic and cultural center of Shash in Middle Age. During the archaeological research on the Kanka site, in the ancient settlement was discovered a palace of the ruler, with a house temple of fire in the citadel. The monumental city temple was discovered in Shahristan I, direct data that is given in Chinese sources. The unique discovered here the remains of monumental lists of temple and type- bull connected with the Manichaean religion. The residential area, industrial workshops, big monumental caravanserai and bazaar squares were discovered in the period of Shahristan III.

Origins  The bank's predecessor was incorporated in England on 27 September 1862Companies House webcheck Company number 2854 as the London, Buenos Ayres and River Plate Bank (Banco de Londres, Buenos Ayres y Río de la Plata), originally to operate in Buenos Aires. The bank soon opened branches elsewhere in Argentina, and it changed its name in 1865 to the London and River Plate Bank (Banco de Londres y Río de la Plata). The bank expanded over the years to have operations in Uruguay, Brazil and Chile.Aim25 website: London and River Plate Bank Records In 1918, it was acquired by Lloyds Bank Limited. In 1923, Lloyds Bank brought about a merger with the separately owned London and Brazilian Bank, to prevent the two banks being in direct competition with each other. The merged bank was renamed as the Bank of London and South America (BOLSA). Lloyds retained a major interest in BOLSA throughout its subsequent history.  History  In 1936, BOLSA took over many of the operations of its chief rival, the Anglo-South American Bank, which had gone into liquidation. The acquisitions included Banco de A. Edwards, one of the largest banks in Chile. In 1958, the bank formed a joint venture with the Bank of Montreal, known as the Bank of London and Montreal (BOLAM), headquartered in Nassau, Bahamas. BOLSA contributed its branches in Central and northern South America to the joint venture. In 1970, BOLSA bought out its joint venture partners, and regained its branches in Central America, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru, but not its branches in Venezuela, which BOLAM had closed in 1965. In 1971, Lloyds Bank bought the controlling interest in BOLSA and merged it with Lloyds Bank Europe to form Lloyds and Bolsa International Bank. This became Lloyds Bank International in 1974 and was merged into Lloyds Bank in 1986.Lloyds Bank (Merger) Act 1985 (cap. 9) Banco de A. Edwards was sold in 1987 to Midland Bank, part of HSBC since 1992, and merged into Banco de Chile in 2001.

The Nyero rock paintings are among the most important rock art in Uganda.  History  Nyero rock paintings date to before 1250 CE. They were first documented in 1913 and later described by researchers as largely of geometric nature. This type of rock art is part of a homogeneous tradition often depicted in red pigment, spreading across east, central and parts of southern Africa, matching the distribution of the Late Stone Age hunter-gatherer culture. This art is generally attributed to Batwa (Twa) hunter-gatherers who are of Pygmy origin, and are today, in Eastern Africa, only found in small groups near the Rwanda/Uganda border and eastern Congo. It is likely that Twa hunter-gatherer communities once lived in the general area of these rock art sites, probably moving on due to the arrival of the present inhabitants (Nilotic, Luo, and Bantu groups). The paintings enrich the cultural identity of the people of Iteso, Uganda, and Africa as a whole.  Description  Nyero rock art site has six shelters (Nyero 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6). They are described below. = Nyero 1 = This is a small rock shelter formed by a low overhanging rock perched above three supporting rocks. On the outer edge of the overhang are six sets of concentric circles in white, together with paintings in the shape of ‘acacia pods’. = Nyero 2 = This is the main shelter, it has a high vertical rock against the back wall and an overhang formed by the breaking away of an enormous boulder estimated to weigh at least 20,000 tons. The overhang protects the paintings from direct rain and rocks in front and to the sides protect the paintings from the sun. The paintings are all done in shades of red. Concentric circles are the dominant form and more than forty different drawings were identified. There is one large ‘acacia pod’ design that has also been called a canoe. On the south-eastern side of the shelter, a narrow passage between the boulders leads to a small, dark shelter where there is a small cavity known as the ‘pocket’where the early inhabitants used to offer gifts to there gods after receiving help from them. Members of the local community still follow a tradition of placing money there either before or after receiving help from ancestral spirits. = Nyero 3 = This shelter is at the far northern end of the Inselberg and about 8 minutes walk from Nyero 2. It is formed by a large boulder perched on top of supporting rocks with no standing room. Once inside the artificial protecting wall, visitors have to crouch low down to reach the far end where another artificial wall makes it less dangerous and allows a wide view of the land below. The painting consists of white concentric circles; the outer circles are surrounded by double curved designs, between which are double lines divided into smaller compartments. =Nyero 4= This is a small shelter on the south-western side of the hill where there are a few traces of red finger-painted concentric circles,Namono, 2010, p.314 two conical shapes and lines. = Nyero 5 = This is situated on the western side of the hill near to the primary school, has a red geometric motif composed of a combination of circular and linear shapes made with both a brush and a finger.Namono, 2010, p.315 Unfortunately, part of it has been damaged by natural water erosion. = Nyero 6 = This is situated high on top of the hill and has a good view of the surrounding countryside. There are traces of red pigment forming two finger-painted outlines of small oval shapes and a slanting L-shape as well as an outlined cross with a small circle below.Namono, 2010 The painted surface is exfoliating and is open to the rain and morning sun.  Intangible heritage  The rock art sites are believed to have been sacred places of the gods. The red and white paintings remain valuable to the people of Teso but are also mysterious since the painters are unknown. In the past, the Iteso people of Nyero would sacrifice and pay offerings to the gods for problems of rain, misfortune, blessings and child bearing (Nyero 3). Individual and clan prayers were held on a seasonal basis. Oral history has recorded strong attachment to sites though people were stopped from praying in the 1970s by the Government at the time. Traces of smoke from sacrifices are still visible in some of the caves. The association of a sacred prayer place in the buffer zone continues to draw nearby communities to the site.  Legal protections  The legal framework for protecting heritage is the 1995 constitution of the Republic of Uganda, under national objectives and directive principles of state policy (XXV), which obligates the state to preserve and protect Uganda's heritage. In addition, Article 178 (13) of the same constitution also allows the state to gazette, own and manage the national cultural sites. The constitution further, in article 189(1) schedule 6(10), mandates the central Government to manage national monuments, antiquities and archives. The Historical Monuments Act of 1967 and amendment decree 1977 govern the protection of Cultural Property in Uganda. The Historical Monuments Act 1967 Cap 46 provides for preservation and protection of historical monuments and objects of archaeological, paleontological, ethnographical and traditional interest. Rock Art sites and properties of cultural significance identified, preserved and promoted are legally protected properties of the State. Any destruction, alteration or other offences are convicted to six months imprisonment or a fine.  World Heritage status  This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on 10 September 1997, in the Cultural category.Nyero Rockpaintings (Ancient paintings in rockshelters) - UNESCO World Heritage Centre  Access  The rock paintings are easily accessible from the gravel road between Kumi and Ngora, appr. 1 km west of Nyero. An entrance fee is collected and a guided tour is provided at the entrance gate (opened daily). A guide will recite the history of the place and take visitors around the caves.

Technically, minuscule amounts of (a) cellular lysates, from intact cells or laser capture microdissected cells, (b) body fluids such as serum, CSF, urine, vitreous, saliva, etc., are immobilized on individual spots on a microarray that is then incubated with a single specific antibody to detect expression of the target protein across many samples. A summary video of RPPA is available.O'Mahony, F. C., Nanda, J., Laird, A., Mullen, P., Caldwell, H., Overton, I. M., et al. The Use of Reverse Phase Protein Arrays (RPPA) to Explore Protein Expression Variation within Individual Renal Cell Cancers. J. Vis. Exp. (71), e50221. doi:10.3791/50221 (2013) http://www.jove.com/video/50221/the-use-reverse- phase-protein-arrays-rppa-to-explore-protein. One microarray, depending on the design, can accommodate hundreds to thousands of samples that are printed in a series of replicates. Detection is performed using either a primary or a secondary labeled antibody by chemiluminescent, fluorescent or colorimetric assays. The array is then imaged and the obtained data is quantified. Multiplexing is achieved by probing multiple arrays spotted with the same lysate with different antibodies simultaneously and can be implemented as a quantitative calibrated assay. In addition, since RPMA can utilize whole-cell or undissected or microdissected cell lysates, it can provide direct quantifiable information concerning post translationally modified proteins that are not accessible with other high-throughput techniques. Thus, RPMA provides high-dimensional proteomic data in a high throughput, sensitive and quantitative manner. However, since the signal generated by RPMA could be generated from unspecific primary or secondary antibody binding, as is seen in other techniques such as ELISA, or immunohistochemistry, the signal from a single spot could be due to cross-reactivity. Thus, the antibodies used in RPMA must be carefully validated for specificity and performance against cell lysates by western blot. RPMA has various uses such as quantitative analysis of protein expression in cancer cells, body fluids or tissues for biomarker profiling, cell signaling analysis and clinical prognosis, diagnosis or therapeutic prediction. This is possible as a RPMA with lysates from different cell lines and or laser capture microdissected tissue biopsies of different disease stages from various organs of one or many patients can be constructed for determination of relative or absolute abundance or differential expression of a protein marker level in a single experiment. It is also used for monitoring protein dynamics in response to various stimuli or doses of drugs at multiple time points. Some other applications that RPMA is used for include exploring and mapping protein signaling pathways, evaluating molecular drug targets and understanding a candidate drug's mechanism of action. It has been also suggested as a potential early screen test in cancer patients to facilitate or guide therapeutic decision making. Other protein microarrays include forward protein microarrays (PMAs) and antibody microarrays (AMAs). PMAs immobilize individual purified and sometimes denatured recombinant proteins on the microarray that are screened by antibodies and other small compounds. AMAs immobilize antibodies that capture analytes from the sample applied on the microarray. The target protein is detected either by direct labeling or a secondary labeled antibody against a different epitope on the analyte target protein (sandwich approach). Both PMAs and AMAs can be classified as forward phase arrays as they involve immobilization of a bait to capture an analyte. In forward phase arrays, each array is incubated with one test sample such as a cellular lysate or a patient's serum, but multiple analytes in the sample are tested simultaneously. Figure 1 shows a forward (using antibody as a bait in here) and reverse phase protein microarray at the molecular level. Experimental design and procedure Depending on the research question or the type and aim of the study, RPMA can be designed by selecting the content of the array, the number of samples, sample placement within micro-plates, array layout, type of microarrayer, correct detection antibody, signal detection method, inclusion of control and quality control of the samples. The actual experiment is then set up in the laboratory and the results obtained are quantified and analyzed. The experimental stages are listed below: =Sample collection= Cells are grown in T-25 flasks at 37 degree and 5% CO2 in appropriate medium. Depending on the design of the study, after cells are confluent they could be treated with drugs, growth factors or they could be irradiated before lysis step. For time course studies, a stimulant is added to a set of flasks concurrently and the flasks are then processed at different time points. For drug dose studies, a set of flasks are treated with different doses of the drug and all the flasks are collected at the same time. If a RPMA containing cell fraction lysates of a tissue/s is to be made, laser capture microdissection (LCM) or fine needle aspiration methods is used to isolate specific cells from a region of tissue microscopically. =Cell lysis= Pellets from cells collected through any of the above means are lysed with a cell lysis buffer to obtain high protein concentration. =Antibody screening= Aliquots of the lysates are pooled and resolved by two-dimensional single lane SDS-PAGE followed by western blotting on a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane is cut into four-millimeter strips, and each strip is probed with a different antibody. Strips with single band indicate specific antibodies that are suitable for RPMA use. Antibody performance should be also validated with a smaller sample size under identical condition before actual sample collection for RPMA. =RPMA construction= Cell lysates are collected and are serially diluted six to ten times if using colorimetric techniques, or without dilution when fluorometric detection is used (due to the greater dynamic range of fluorescence than colorimetric detection). Serial dilutions are then plated in replicates into a 384- or a 1536-well microtiter plate. The lysates are then printed onto either nitrocellulose or PVDF membrane coated glass slides by a microarrayer such as Aushon BioSystem 2470 or Flexys robot (Genomic solution). Aushon 2470 with a solid pin system is the ideal choice as it can be used for producing arrays with very viscous lysates and it has humidity environmental control and automated slide supply system. That being said, there are published papers showing that Arrayit Microarray Printing Pins can also be used and produce microarrays with much higher throughput using less lysate.Proteome Science  Full text  Development of reverse phase protein microarrays for the validation of clusterin, a mid-abundant blood biomarker The membrane coated glass slides are commercially available from several different companies such as Schleicher and Schuell Bioscience (now owned by GE Whatman www.whatman.com), Grace BioLabs (www.gracebio.com), Thermo Scientific, and SCHOTT Nexterion (www.schott.com/nexterion). =Immunochemical signal detection= After the slides are printed, non-specific binding sites on the array are blocked using a blocking buffer such as I-Block and the arrays are probed with a primary antibody followed by a secondary antibody. Detection is usually conducted with DakoCytomation catalyzed signal amplification (CSA) system. For signal amplification, slides are incubated with streptavidin- biotin-peroxidase complex followed by biotinyl-tyramide/hydrogen peroxide and streptavidin-peroxidase. Development is completed using hydrogen peroxide and scans of the slides are obtained (1). Tyramide signal amplification works as follows: immobilized horseradish peroxidase (HRP) converts tyramide into reactive intermediate in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. Activated tyramide binds to neighboring proteins close to a site where the activating HRP enzyme is bound. This leads to more tyramide molecule deposition at the site; hence the signal amplification.For a detailed protocol of the technique, refer to Lance Liotta and Emanual Petricoin invented the RPMA technique in 2001 (see history section below), and have developed a multiplexed detection method using near-infrared fluorescent techniques.Calvert, V. Tang, Y. Boveia, V. Wulfkuhle, J. Schutz-Geschwender, A Olive, D. Liotta, L. and Petricoin, E. (2004). Development of multiplexed protein profiling and detection using near infrared detection of reverse-phase protein microarrays. Clinical Proteomics Journal. (1):81-89 In this study, they report the use of a dual dye-based approach that can effectively double the number of endpoints observed per array, allowing, for example, both phospho-specific and total protein levels to be measured and analyzed at once. =Data quantification and analysis= Once immunostaining has been performed protein expression must then be quantified. The signal levels can be obtained by using the reflective mode of an ordinary optical flatbed scanner if a colorimetric detection technique is used or by laser scanning, such as with a TECAN LS system, if fluorescent techniques are used. Two programs available online (P-SCAN and ProteinScan) can then be used to convert the scanned image into numerical values. These programs quantify signal intensities at each spot and use a dose interpolation algorithm (DI25) to compute a single normalized protein expression level value for each sample. Normalization is necessary to account for differences in total protein concentration between each sample and so that antibody staining can be directly compared between samples. This can be achieved by performing an experiment in parallel in which total proteins are stained by colloidal gold total protein staining or Sypro Ruby total protein staining. When multiple RPMAs are analyzed, the signal intensity values can be displayed as a heat map, allowing for Bayesian clustering analysis and profiling of signaling pathways. An optimal software tool, custom designed for RPMAs is called Microvigene, by Vigene Tech, Inc. Strengths The greatest strength of RPMAs is that they allow for high throughput, multiplexed, ultra-sensitive detection of proteins from extremely small numbers of input material, a feat which cannot be done by conventional western blotting or ELISA. The small spot size on the microarray, ranging in diameter from 85 to 200 micrometres, enables the analysis of thousands of samples with the same antibody in one experiment. RPMAs have increased sensitivity and are capable of detecting proteins in the picogram range. Some researchers have even reported detection of proteins in the attogram range. This is a significant improvement over protein detection by ELISA, which requires microgram amounts of protein (6). The increase in sensitivity of RPMAs is due to the miniature format of the array, which leads to an increase in the signal density (signal intensity/area) coupled with tyramide deposition-enabled enhancement. The high sensitivity of RPMAs allows for the detection of low abundance proteins or biomarkers such as phosphorylated signaling proteins from very small amounts of starting material such as biopsy samples, which are often contaminated with normal tissue. Using laser capture microdissection lysates can be analyzed from as few as 10 cells, with each spot containing less than a hundredth of a cell equivalent of protein. A great improvement of RPMAs over traditional forward phase protein arrays is a reduction in the number of antibodies needed to detect a protein. Forward phase protein arrays typically use a sandwich method to capture and detect the desired protein. This implies that there must be two epitopes on the protein (one to capture the protein and one to detect the protein) for which specific antibodies are available. Other forward phase protein microarrays directly label the samples, however there is often variability in the labeling efficiency for different protein, and often the labeling destroys the epitope to which the antibody binds. This problem is overcome by RPMAs as sample need not be labeled directly. Another strength of RPMAs over forward phase protein microarrays and western blotting is the uniformity of results, as all samples on the chip are probed with the same primary and secondary antibody and the same concentration of amplification reagents for the same length of time. This allows for the quantification of differences in protein levels across all samples. Furthermore, printing each sample, on the chip in serial dilution (colorimetric) provides an internal control to ensure analysis is performed only in the linear dynamic range of the assay. Optimally, printing of calibrators and high and low controls directly on the same chip will then provide for unmatched ability to quantitatively measure each protein over time and between experiments. A problem that is encountered with tissue microarrays is antigen retrieval and the inherent subjectivity of immunohistochemistry. Antibodies, especially phospho-specific reagents, often detect linear peptide sequences that may be masked due to the three- dimensional conformation of the protein. This problem is overcome with RPMAs as the samples can be denatured, revealing any concealed epitopes. Weaknesses The biggest limitation of RPMA, as is the case for all immunoassays, is its dependence on antibodies for detection of proteins. Currently there is a limited but rapidly growing number of signaling proteins for which antibodies exist that give an analyzable signal. In addition, finding the appropriate antibody could require extensive screening of many antibodies by western blotting prior to beginning RPMA analysis. To overcome this issue, two open resource databases have been created to display western blot results for antibodies that have good binding specificity within the expected range.AbMiner Furthermore, RPMAs, unlike western blots, do not resolve protein fractions by molecular weight. Thus, it is critical that upfront antibody validation be performed. History RPMA was first introduced in 2001 in a paper by Lance Liotta and Emanuel Petricoin who invented the technology. The authors used the technique to successfully analyze the state of pro-survival checkpoint protein at the microscopic transition stage using laser capture microdissection of histologically normal prostate epithelium, prostate intraepithelial neoplasia, and patient-matched invasive prostate cancer. Since then RPMA has been used in many basic biology, translational and clinical research. In addition, the technique has now been brought into clinical trials for the first time whereby patients with metastatic colorectal and breast cancers are chosen for therapy based on the results of the RPMA. This technique has been commercialized for personalized medicine-based applications by Theranostics Health, Inc.

The company was acquired by the Chachas family in June 2019 and announced that it would be opening a San Francisco location for the holiday season as well as an e-commerce business. History S & G Gump was founded in 1861 as a mirror and frame shop by Solomon Gump and his brother, Gustav. It later sold moldings, gilded cornices, and European artwork to those recently made wealthy from the California Gold Rush. The business flourished; the store sold products ranging from jewelry made from jade, precious gemstones, and cultured freshwater pearls to products from luxury designers such as Hermès and Buccellati. Customers included Franklin D. Roosevelt, who bought model ships and smoking jackets there, and Sarah Bernhardt, who bought a 17th-century bronze Chinese snake in preparation for playing Cleopatra.Bill Van Niekerken, \\"Ode to Gump’s: Memories flow from archive as SF’s oldest store says goodbye\\", San Francisco Chronicle, December 19, 2018. It was eventually passed on to Solomon's son Alfred Livingston Gump. The fire following the 1906 earthquake destroyed the store and all of the merchandise, but thanks to Dodie Valencia, A.L. received $17,000 for one of his paintings, which allowed funding for the rebuilding and restocking of the store. A.L. was fueled by his passion for Oriental art and began selling his exotic collectibles from the Far East. He sent his buyers to Japan and China, bringing back exotic rugs, porcelains, silks, bronzes and jades to California's new millionaires. Richard Gump, one of A.L.’s three children, eventually became president of Gump's after his father's death in 1947. He continued the family legacy, running the company's overall operations until his retirement in 1975. Gump's was sold to publisher Crowell Collier, which after further mergers became Macmillan Publishers. By June 1989, Gump's had again been sold,Isadore Barmash, \\"Business People; Gump's Specialty Stores Said to Fill Top Position\\",The New York Times, August 1, 1989. this time to an investment group including Japan's Tobu Department Store and the Charterhouse Group. In 1993 Gump's was in financial trouble when the catalog company later known as Hanover Direct bought it. They reduced the product lines, holding a liquidation sale on May 24, 1993, and revived the business, then in 2005 sold it to an investment group for $8.5 million.Jenny Strasburg, \\"Investment firms buying Gump's: Deal expected to be completed in March\\", San Francisco Chronicle, February 16, 2005.Sophia Kunthara, \\"With Gump's closed, beloved Buddha statue pulls vanishing act\\", San Francisco Chronicle, December 25, 2018.

Buddha statue A statue of Buddha was displayed inside the San Francisco store. The original statue was bronze, acquired in 1928; in 1949 Gump's donated it to the San Francisco Parks Department in memory of Alfred Livingston Gump, and it is in the Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park.Bill Van Niekerken, \\"A history lesson from the Buddha at SF's Japanese Tea Garden\\", San Francisco Chronicle, July 7, 2015, updated December 10, 2018. It was replaced at some point by an unusually large Qing Dynasty gilded wood Buddha. This was carved in the Chengde Mountain Resort, the summer capital of the Qing Emperors in the early 19th century, and was the largest of its kind outside a museum. It was bought by one of the 2005 purchasers, New York investment banker John Chachas, who loaned it to the store until the liquidation.

It stands for desire, love, and the metaphysical striving for the infinite and unreachable. It symbolizes hope and the beauty of things. Early use of the symbol German author Novalis introduced the symbol into the Romantic movement through his unfinished coming-of-age story, entitled Heinrich von Ofterdingen.Henry of Ofterdingen: a Romance, By Novalis (English Translation) After contemplating a meeting with a stranger, the young Heinrich von Ofterdingen dreams about a blue flower which calls to him and absorbs his attention. Explanation of the symbol \\"This blue flower is the watchword and sacred symbol of the [Romantic] school,\\" according to H.H. Boyesen. \\"It is meant to symbolize the deep and sacred longings of a poet's soul. Romantic poetry invariably deals with longing; not a definite, formulated desire for some obtainable object, but a dim, mysterious aspiration, a trembling unrest, a vague sense of kinship with the infinite, and a consequent dissatisfaction with every form of happiness which the world has to offer.\\" Thomas Carlyle offered this, that the blue flower \\"being Poetry, the real object, passion and vocation of young Heinrich, which, through manifold adventures, exertions and sufferings, he is to seek and find.\\" Use of the symbol Joseph Freiherr von Eichendorff wrote a poem called Die blaue Blume (The blue flower). Adelbert von Chamisso saw the core of Romanticism in the motif, and Goethe searched for the \\"Urpflanze\\" or \\"original plant\\" in Italy, which in some interpretations could refer to the blue flower. E. T. A. Hoffmann used the Blue Flower as a symbol for the poetry of Novalis and the \\"holy miracle of nature\\" in his short tale \\"Nachricht von den neuesten Schicksalen des Hundes Berganza\\". In 1902, Charles Scribner's Sons published The Blue Flower, a collection of short stories by Henry Van Dyke, the first two of which, \\"The Blue Flower\\" and \\"The Source\\", refer to the blue flower as a symbol of desire and hope, and the object of the narrator's search. This volume also includes Van Dyke's most famous story, \\"The Other Wise Man\\". Blue rose Walter Benjamin used the image of the blue flower several times in his writing. For example, the opening sentence of his essay Dream Kitsch: \\"No one really dreams any longer of the Blue Flower. Whoever awakes as Heinrich von Ofterdingen today must have overslept.\\" Also in his Work of Art essay: \\"The equipment-free aspect of reality has here become the height of artifice, and the vision of immediate reality the Blue Flower in the land of technology.\\"The Work of Art in the Age of Its Technological Reproducibility, and Other Writings on Media, Harvard University Press, C.S. Lewis, in his autobiographical book, Surprised By Joy, references the \\"Blue Flower\\" when speaking of the feelings of longing that beauty elicited when he was a child of six. He associates it with the German word sehnsucht, and states that this intense longing for things transcendent made him \\"a votary of the Blue Flower.\\" English writer Penelope Fitzgerald's historical novel The Blue Flower is based on Novalis's early life.Jordison, Sam. ″The Blue Flower's elusive magic″. ‘’www.theguardian.com’’. 10 Jan 2017. In John le Carré's 1968 novel A Small Town in Germany, the character Bradfield says, \\"I used to think I was a Romantic, always looking for the blue flower\\" (Pan edition, p. 286 – chap. 17). Substance D, a fictitious drug in Philip K. Dick's 1977 novel A Scanner Darkly, is derived from a plant with blue flower. Tennessee Williams used images of blue roses in his play, The Glass Menagerie, to symbolize the frailty and uniqueness of Laura, a central character that reflects the life of Williams' sister, who underwent a lobotomy. In the play, Laura is nicknamed \\"Blue Roses\\" after another character misheard her say \\"pleurosis\\". The alternative rock band Mazzy Star released a charting single in 1990 titled \\"Blue Flower\\" from their album She Hangs Brightly. In his fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire, American author George R. R. Martin uses the blue flower as a reoccurring symbol to represent young women of the noble House Stark, often with hints to an illicit love affair. In one instance, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen uses blue winter roses to crown the Lady Lyanna Stark as the \\"Queen of Love and Beauty\\" at the Tournament of Harrenhal, passing over his own wife, Princess Elia of Dorne. Nowadays there is a French expression fleur bleue describing a sensitive dreamer and ingénue person. The color blue applied to a flower means a tenderness unavowed but also an emotion of purity, sincerity, gentleness, sensitivity and discretion. =Wandervogel movement= In 1960 Werner Helwig published the book The Blue Flower of the Wandervogel (Die blaue Blume des Wandervogels) a history of the youth movement. Within the movement, a number of folk songs used the motif. =The German student movement of the 60s= In the 1960s, the German Left reacted against Novalis's imaginary blaue blume, which had become a symbol of Romanticism and bourgeois high culture. The student's chant was \\"Schlagt die Germanistik tot, färbt die blaue Blume rot!\\" (\\"Strike Germanistics dead, color the blue flower red!\\"). =Television, film, and theatre= David Lynch uses the symbol of the blue flower in the 2010 short film \\"Lady Blue Shanghai\\", a 16-minute, promotional short film for fashion designer Dior starring Marion Cotillard, among others. In the film a blue flower is hidden in a Dior handbag, at first feared and finally embraced by the female protagonist. It may be said that Lynch is associating the handbag with \\"divine\\" inspiration and creativity. Stanley Kubrick made use of the Blue Flower in his final film, Eyes Wide Shut. Sandor Szavost (Sky Dumont) is wearing one while dancing with Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman). In the prequel to David Lynch's television series Twin Peaks, entitled Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me, two FBI agents are informed about their upcoming task through a woman named Lil. On her lapel is a tiny, artificial blue rose, clearly symbolic of something; but when Sam asks, Chet simply replies, \\"But I can't tell you about that.\\" Blue flower is featured in the 2005 film Batman Begins. In it, a fear-intensifying hallucinogenic drug is manufactured from blue flowers. The drug is used by Ra's al Ghul and Dr. Jonathan Crane (the Scarecrow), who plan to terrorize Gotham City by weaponizing the drug into a concentrated powder form and release it into the city's water supply. Blue flower is again used as the source of a fictitious mind-altering drug, here called Substance D, in the 2006 adaptation of Philip K. Dick's novel A Scanner Darkly. A display of blue Baptisia australis flowers is used as a symbol of private support for an annual night of extrajudicial killings that serves as the central plot device of 2013 motion picture The Purge. James and Ruth Bauer, husband and wife collaborative team, wrote an unconventional music theatre piece entitled The Blue Flower at the turn of the 21st century. Speaking through liberally fictionalized versions of artists Max Beckmann, Franz Marc, and Hannah Höch as well as pivotal female scientific figure Marie Curie, the piece works with the romantic significance of the blue flower as it meditates on the brutal political and cultural turmoil of World War I, the short lived Weimar Republic, and Adolf Hitler's rise to power in the Nazi Party.Isherwood, Charles. ″Inside the Whirlwind Set Spinning by War″. www.NYTimes.com. November 9th, 2011. Archived 2019-2-18. A 2012 episode of the BBC television series New Tricks, entitled \\"Blue Flower\\", concerns the murder of an East German refugee who had been involved in the Blue Flower organisation. Blue flower is used in the 2016 film Zootopia. In it, the flowers are called \\"night howlers\\" and are the source of a drug that causes mammals to become savage and attack anyone who comes near.

He was involved in several high-profile Communist prosecutions, including the Alger Hiss, William Remington, Abraham Brothman, and Julius and Ethel Rosenberg cases. Biography He was born to a Jewish family on September 3, 1905, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City to Louis and Michakin Saypol. While attending night classes at Brooklyn Law School, from which he graduated in 1927, he married Adele B. Kaplan in September 1925. Their son, Ronald Saypol, served as CEO of Lionel Corporation from 1968 to 1982. He was admitted to the bar in 1928. Saypol quickly advanced in the United States Attorney's Office. He became the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Irving Saypol led the prosecution of several members of the Communist Party of the United States (CPUSA) including Eugene Dennis, William Z. Foster, John Gates, Robert G. Thompson, Gus Hall, William Remington, Abraham Brothman and Miriam Moskowitz. As a result of these prosecutions Saypol was described by Time as \\"the nation's number one legal hunter of top communists.\\" From 1950 to 1951 he was Chief Prosecutor for the federal government in the espionage case against Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and Morton Sobell. He gained a reputation as an efficient prosecutor of Communists. Saypol served on the New York Supreme Court from 1952 until 1968. In 1976 he was indicted with Surrogate S. Samuel DiFalco for bribery and perjury in connection with an alleged scheme to obtain appraisal and auction commission funds for Saypol's son; the charges were dismissed. In 1975 Saypol ruled against the landmark designation for Grand Central Terminal in New York City removing legal barriers to the construction of a 59-story office tower on top of the terminal.

In 1484, Pope Innocent VIII appointed him Captain-General of the Church.Hollingsworth p. 141 He married Giovanna da Montefeltro, daughter of Federico III da Montefeltro, and some of their descendants adopted the surname Montefeltro della Rovere. Their children included Francesco Maria I della Rovere, the first Duke of Urbino, who married Eleonora Gonzaga. After Charles VIII of France had abandoned the Kingdom of Naples and the Aragonese had been restored there, a conspiracy was hatched against the latter at Isola di Sora, in Giovanni's territories. However, the plot was thwarted, although after it the Duchy of Sora followed a more anti-Spanish and pro-papal policy, and Giovanni led some pro-French expeditions in Campania and Abruzzo from 1494 to 1501. In 1495 he conquered Ceprano, Montecassino and the Terra Sancti Benedicti. In 1496 he defended the duchy against Prospero Colonna and Frederick IV of Naples, losing some territories, although most of them were later returned to him by Pope Alexander VI. Giovanni della Rovere died in Rome in 1501. See also *Duchy of Sora NotesReferences *Hollingsworth, Mary (2011): The Borgias. History's Most Notorious Dynasty. Quercus.
